Pretty eyes, pretty eyes
Not a cloud in my day
Not a cloud in my way
Angel eyes, no disguise
No pretension is here
No pretension, no fear

Don't leave me calling
Don't leave me falling
Don't leave me calling
Don't leave me falling

Stay awhile, stay awhile
I will tell you my mind
I will tell you my mind

I will kill everything
Just to take all your pain
Just to take all your pain

Don't leave me calling
Don't leave me falling
Don't leave me calling
Don't leave me falling
