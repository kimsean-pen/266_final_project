What is a man who lays a hand on his lover
And calls it tough love, tough love?
What is a man who can't take a stand for his daughter
And calls it tough love, tough love?
Your roots grow in the cracks of the alleys
College park made you
Man enough to see, man enough to see
There ain't a goddamn man in me

Take me back to a date
Before I was hostile and learned to hate
(You promised you would never become)
You promised you would never become
A storm, a blackout replicating the one
The thunder inside him became your life
You called him your best friend 'til the day you were nine

What is a man who lays a hand on his lover
And calls it tough love, tough love?
What is a man who can't take a stand for his daughter
And calls it tough love, tough love?

Hotel rooms, bourbon, and broads
A drifter living life, without God
You've done it now, you planted a seed
Now the storm inside you, it swallows her

Baby love, alright
And I know life can be so strange
But I know I can make a change
I'mma wipe away the clouds for ya
I'm gonna be around for ya
I'm gonna paint the town for ya
I'm gonna make a promise to
Give you everything you want and need
But she fucked up now
'Cause she's bearing another mouth you can't feed
Cease production of a destructive breed
Seek help 'cause your pride only makes you weak

And what is a man who lays a hand on his lover
And calls it tough love, tough love?
What is a man who can't take a stand for his daughter
And calls it tough love, tough love?
Your roots grow in the cracks of the alleys
College park made you
Man enough to see, man enough to see
There ain't a goddamn man in me
(There ain't a goddamn man in me)
