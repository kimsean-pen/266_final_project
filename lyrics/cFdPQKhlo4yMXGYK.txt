I lost you awhile ago
But still I don't know why
I can't say your name
Without a crow flying by
Gotta watch my back now
That you turned me around
Got me walking backwards
Into my hometown

Throw me a rope
On the rolling tide
What did you want me to be?
You said it's him or me
The way you made it
That's the way it will be

It was seven years on the burning shore
With gatling guns and paint
Working the lowlands door-to-door
Like a Latter Day Saint
Then you turn me out
At the top of the stairs
You took all the glory
That you just couldn't share

I've never been so disabused
Never been so mad
I've never been served anything
That tasted so bad
You might need a friend
Any day now, any day
Oh my brother, be careful
You are drifting away

Throw me a rope
On the rolling tide
What did you want me to be?
You said it's him or me
The way you made it
That's the way it will be

The way you made it
That's the way it will be
