Wings of an angel replaced by beatiful scars
well hidden in the dark.
Time seems to stand still
The world is falling apart
So heavy on my heart.
And it's raining
And it all comes crashing down
Anyone would give up
But not me, not now.

Even with broken wings
Even with shattered dreams
I'm still gonna try
I'm still gonna fly
Even with broken wings
I can do anything
I found the strenght I never knew I had in me
With these broken wings

Turning the pages
Cuts like a knife once again
Where does the end begin?
Through all the stages,
a silent fighter remains.
You got to lose to win
Through the fire
And the smoke starts to clear
Anyone would give up
But not now, not here

Even with broken wings
Even with shattered dreams
I'm still gonna try
I'm still gonna fly
Even with broken wings
I can do anything
I found the strenght I never knew I had in me
With these broken wings

Yeah I said I never doubted
You wrapped your hand around me
And Changed my everything

Even with broken wings
Even with shattered dreams
I'm still gonna try
I'm still gonna fly
Even with broken wings
Even with shattered dreams
I'm still gonna try
I'm still gonna fly
Even with broken wings
I can do anything
I found the strenght I never knew I had in me
With these broken wings.
