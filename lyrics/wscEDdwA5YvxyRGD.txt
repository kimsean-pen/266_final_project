(feat. Carl McIntosh & Jane Eugene)

(Pete Rock)
Zone out now, one two, yo
This goes out to all coasts
East coast, West coast
And all across the nation, worldwide
Know what I mean? Relax, kick your feet up
Spark one, let me show you how it's done
Blow lady

(Jane Eugene)
Sunrise, starts the day
Lay back, ease your pain
Don't sweat, simple things
Take your time, do your thing

(Pete Rock)
As grains of sand pass from hand to hand
I watch time stand still I'm just one man
That's out for all so all should be for one
Grew up on the drum with the J.B. "Unh!"
The son, who spun the record that his pop's collected
Went on to create and perfect the unexpected
Funky beat sound watch the family "Get down!"
Slide with the right and give cousin a pound
Watch the young ones play and think back in the day
When fresh was the style, plus the word to say
It's all love now, let me show you how
to take time out, and show you what life's about

Chorus: Jane Eugene and Carl McIntosh

Take your time walk the line just a matter of time
Take your time walk the line just a matter of time
Take your time walk the line just a matter of time
Wo oh just a mattter of time

(Jane Eugene)
Feel the flow, and let it go
Unwind, relax your mind
Stay a while, take your time
Bet you'll find, peace of mind

(Pete Rock)
With a, douse of soul, I'm back in control
My goal sees the world pass from young to old
Unfold a new tale, see yourself on scale
2000 the year my black people prevail
Yo straight up and down I got love for this son
Nine years in the mix and if time permits
I'll continue to make my melody for the tapes
And walk the fine line between love and hate

Chorus 4X
