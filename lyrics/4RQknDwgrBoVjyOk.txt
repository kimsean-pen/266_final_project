[Kim]
Dead boy stares
Strange to meet you
Dead boy cares
So great to see you
Is it time to go?
It's a place I know
I can't read yr mind
I can't find the time
I can't feel the thrill
I don't have the will

Dead boy dares
Believe in you
Dead boy stares
Afraid that you will see him
Is it time to go?
Is it a place I know?
I can't read yr mind
I can't find the time
I can't feel the thrill
I don't have the will

I love you metallic blue
I love you golden blue
I miss you shining all alone
I miss you I don't know what to do
I don't glitter like the stars above
I don't glow like neon alone
Don't blush it's just the wind outside
Don't rush to be by my side
