Days had come, winters had gone
And we gamboled like siblings in Paradise
I was your knight, holding you tight
As a brother when I saw your crying eyes
Time went by and we had to say goodbye

Staring up to the clouds above
Children, so little and sad
Hoping the saints could help one day
Lead us together again
Holding the key to the alley of dreams
Still in hands

Time telling me to say farewell
But I knew that I would fight hell
And I knew: We will
Go for another time we can see
For another time we'll be free
For no more farewell

Time telling me to say farewell
But I knew that I would fight hell
And I knew: We will
Go for another time we can see
For another time we'll be free
For no more farewell

Stepbrother tell me where have you been
When they brought me to this godforsaken place
Sign of the Cross, they took me away
For healing with herbs by the way of grace
Now I wait for the day to feed the flames

I have been caught in a cage of despair
My heart as a monk's cell so empty and bare
But no holy water can make me forget you again

Time telling me to say farewell
But I knew that I would fight hell
And I knew: We will
Go for another time we can see
For another time we'll be free
For no more farewell

Time telling me to say farewell
But I knew that I would fight hell
And I knew: We will
Go for another time we can see
For another time we'll be free
For no more farewell

Time telling me to say farewell
But I knew that I would fight hell
And I knew: We will
Go for another time we can see
For another time we'll be free
For no more farewell

Time telling me to say farewell
But I knew that I would fight hell
And I knew: We will
Go for another time we can see
For another time we'll be free
For no more farewell

No farewell could be the last one
If you long to meet again
No farewell could be the last one
If you long to meet again
No farewell could be the last one
If you long to meet again
No farewell could be the last one
If you long to meet again
