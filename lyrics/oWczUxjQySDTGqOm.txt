Borderline case.
Reinforced glass.
Absent friends,
Passport photos,
An elastic past.
Empty pocket...
And they think it's all... (and they think it's all)
They think it's all.
It's all wrapped up on a swollen lip.
He draws the warm pipe.

Chemicals,
Chemicals captured... in winter's grip,
Turn us on.
Seperate the leper.
Hungry ghosts,
Hungry ghosts.
Another imprint...
In borrowed clothes.
We can be numb,
We can be numb.

Passing through.

Blow, blow, blow, blow,
Blow, blow, blow, blow,
Blow, blow, blow, blow,
Blow, blow, blow, blow,
Blow, blow, blow, blow,
Blow, blow, blow, blow,
Blow, blow, blow, blow,
Blow, blow, blow, blow.

Borderline case.
Future proof.
Real thin,
Real thin air.
Real thin air.
