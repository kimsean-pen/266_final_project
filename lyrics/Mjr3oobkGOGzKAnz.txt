Life is a moment to space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place

I kiss the morning goodbye
But down inside
You know we never know why

The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes
And the feeling is strong

I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all

I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again
What do I do?

With you eternally mine
In love there is

No measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I

Live in each other's hearts
We may be oceans away
You feel my love

I hear what you say
No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall

But I give you it all
I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again

What'do I do?
I am a woman in love
And I'm talking to you
You know I know how you feel
What a woman can do
It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again
I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again
