Tension flowing through my veins and I can feel it
I want to cut it out so I can see it
But that's the way I always know, even now, this uncertainty soon will pass

Hours spent inside the room that got me sober
Praying the dopamine would find me sooner
But that's the gash I had to sew
On this road
I just have to own where it goes

Soft manipulating hot and cold
Kept my family waiting long enough

Careless and self centered ways I behaved stained our home
I found a photograph my father took of someone I don't know
I don't recognize

Lovers, and everyone who fought for me to beat it
How could I commit when I didn't feel it?
I wish that I could give you back stolen time
Maybe in the end you'll get mine

I'd kill the light, when everyone was home
I didn't want them to know where I was
Alive at night
I snuck around to be the very thing you tried preventing
Maybe in the end I'll give it back
Maybe in the end you'll get it back
You'll get it back

Soft manipulating hot and cold
Kept my family waiting long enough
I don't know...
Careless and self-centered ways I behaved stained our home
I found a photograph my brother took of someone I don't know
I don't recognize anymore
