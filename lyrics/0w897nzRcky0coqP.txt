Got my life together,
I think I'm over flowin, but you know, flashing gold i fucking stole
Devil stole my fucking soul
Yet I'm still cold, Hell froze
$now Leopard risen the propeller turned
the blizzard into fucking Armageddon, Uh
And you wear the 7, boys up in the 7th ward, but I'm number 11, Yuh
Attention getter, Ay
Grey Beretta, Ay
Slay ya whole gang in the mother fucking cellar, Ay
You seems immortal then I penetrate girl he mecca
The Demon ingest all, I swerve off and totaled my Tesla

Pop the trunk, watch me flex
Shoot a mutha fucka with the AK next
Beretta never loaded cause i want to meet death
Can't scare muthafucka even if you got lead
Flies chomp, welcome to the feast
Hit i12 grabbed Ruby from the East
Snort a bag of dope shoot the rest in my feet
Gold in my teeth it's the beast of the leash

Fuck, Sheesh, R.I.P
Any mutha fucka wanna come and try me
6 Blades, 6 Bullets, have you 6 feet deep.
"$carecrow $carecrow mane you're starting to scare me"
Fuck you, bitch I'm from levees
Where the water ain't steady
Ridin' 20's on my Chevy, Ay, Ay
Shake all the leaves when my feet hit the ground
I see that you pussy, boy don't make a sound
