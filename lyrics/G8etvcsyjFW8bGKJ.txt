Blank stares from broken men
So withered from the poisons
They can't Remember when
There were once honest reasons
It's all a lie, it died 100, 000 miles ago
Pretending I'm still here
Justify
What I've become
Sanctify
What I've become
Amazing disgrace... how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
Better lost if this is found, best blinded
Never to see
The race to save face, nothing now is what
We meant it to be
Pretending I'm still here
It's a system now
Intertwined
Take your place in the line to be ground by the gears of the masterpiece
Betrayal
Justify
What I've become
Justify
What I've become
Suffered consequence
It's been so long since any piece of this made any kind of sense
You anoint the king, I'll burn everything to ashes
You giveth, I taketh away
You giveth, I taketh away
It's a system now
Intertwined
Take your place in the line to be ground by the gears of the masterpiece
Betrayal
