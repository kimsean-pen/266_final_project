When she was a little girl
You'll never want to know
The places she liked
The things she enjoyed
Never ask the girl what she liked
About her childhood
You'll never know
What she's trying to hide from you so
Don't ask
Don't think
Don't guess
Don't say anything that could hurt her
Don't raise your voice
Don't say goodbye
Here, here
Never let her go
Never let her go
Never let her go
Cause she will never be fine alone
Never ever let her walk alone
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ahh-ahh
Never ever
Never ever
Never let her go
Never let her go
Never let her go
Cause she will always, always be yours, yeah
Always yours
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ahh-ahh
Never ever
Never ever
