No, I won't call you baby.
I won't buy you dasies, cause that don't work.
And I know, how to get you crazy,
How to make you want me, so bad it hurts.

I wanna be good, good, good to you
But that's not, not, not your type
So I'm gonna be bad for you tonight, tonight, tonight

I'll misbehave if it turns you on (turns you on).
No Mr.Right if you want Mr.Wrong (mr. wrong).
I'll tell you lies (tell you lies), if you don't like the truth.
I don't wanna be bad (i don't wanna be bad),
I just wanna be bad enough for you
Well I just wanna be bad enough for you,
Well I just wanna be bad enough

Hey (Hey, hey)
Thanks for the number (thanks for the number).

Cause that won't work (cause that won't work).
You like to play (Play, hey)
Hide and go get her (hide and go get her)
Cause you like me better (you like me better),
When i play the jerk (when i play the jerk).

I wanna be good, good, good to you
But that's not, not, not your type

So I'm gonna be bad for you tonight, tonight, tonight

I'll misbehave if it turns you on (turns you on).

You love to hate me when I'm chasing you
And I hate to say this, but I'm stuck on lovin' you
So I pretend that I don't care, I'll stand you up to keep you here
I'll make you hate me, just enough to make you want me

I'll misbehave if it turns you on (turns you on).
No Mr.Right if you want Mr.Wrong (mr. wrong).
I'll tell you lies (tell you lies), if you don't like the truth.
