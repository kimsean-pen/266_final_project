Take my hand
I've changed my mind again
Really I believed it true
that all who fell in love were foolish
But I was wrong
I've learned that lesson well
All the way back home at midnight
you were sleeping on my shoulder

Take my hand
Don't think of obligations
Now, right now
your love is liberation

To free in me
the trust I never dared
I always thought the risk too great
but suddenly I don't hesitate so

Take my hand
Don't think of complications
Now, right now
your love is liberation
Liberation

The night, the stars
A light shone through the dark
All the way back home at midnight
you were sleeping on my shoulder

Take my hand,
Don't think of hesitation
Now, right now
your love is liberation
Liberation

Back home at midnight
All the way back home at midnight
