I know her,
and every notion I get from her I wear inside me
I know her,
all of the broken leaves of love she leaves behind
Oh - don't you hide away from the rain
Oh - can you tell me the name of this game?
I got to get thru to you
Behind the door,
another wall,
a lonely cry,
a call of the wild
A dancing daze,
an empty face,
a crystal high,
a call of the wild
And there is something that sweeps the dark,
a lover's dart,
the call of a broken heart
Wrapped in the night,
behind these eyes,
oh hear the cry,
the call of the wild
I know her,
and in my mind I dream of her,
how she aches without me
I know her and every heart is a lonely
hunter when she walks by
Oh - can you read the hurt in my eyes?
Oh - don't you leave without saying goodbye
I got to get thru to you
Behind the door,
another wall,
a lonely cry,
a call of the wild
A dancing daze,
an empty face,
a crystal high,
a call of the wild
And there is something that sweeps the dark,
a lover's dart,
the call of a broken heart
Wrapped in the night,
behind these eyes,
oh hear the cry,
the call of the wild
Behind the door,
another wall,
a lonely cry,
a call of the wild
A dancing daze,
an empty face,
a crystal high,
a call of the wild
And there is something that sweeps the dark,
a lover's dart,
the call of a broken heart
Wrapped in the night,
behind these eyes,
oh hear the cry,
the call of the wild
