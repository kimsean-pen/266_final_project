That night
You said baby it's alright
And you couldn't tell
But I knew why
Cuz there was no more tears to cry

I don't know what to do when I'm on my own
Waiting by the phone
Hot damn!
Don't want to be there no more

Cuz I can't keep waiting for you
Waiting for you
No, I can't keep waiting for you
Waiting for you

See that night,
You said baby it's alright
You couldn't tell but I knew why
Cuz there were no more reasons why

I don't know what to do when I'm on my own
Sitting by the phone
Oh damn,
Don't want to be alone
Just want to be there again

Cuz I can't keep waiting for you
Waiting for you
No, I can't keep waiting for you
Waiting for you

Cuz I can't keep waiting for you
Waiting for you
No, I can't keep waiting for you
Waiting for you
