Don't wait my friend. We better don't think twice
Time to fell the prison guard you gotta realize
No turning back again. Therefor it's all too late
New horizons wait

I know the time has come to leave your past behind
And now the time has come to stop them controlling your mind

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away
Otherwise she will be dying
While both of us are lying here in chains

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away
Oh, otherwise she will be dying
While both of us are lying caught in chains

Breaking away!

Always been a novice in quest for paradise
Hope they will forgive me for I apostatize
I can't be no hypocrite, can't wear a masquerade
New horizons wait

And now the time has come to go another way
To learn for life and to grow ripe
And prevent the decay

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away
Otherwise she will be dying
While both of us are lying here in chains

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away
Oh, otherwise she will be dying
While both of us are lying caught in chains

Breaking away!
It is so hard to lay down what I've been
But I must go even if my way leads to Hades

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away
Oh, otherwise she will be dying
While both of us are lying caught in chains

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away!
Oh, otherwise she will be dying
While both of us are lying caught in chains
