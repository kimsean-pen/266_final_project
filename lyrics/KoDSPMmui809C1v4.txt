Woo
Okay
Like you all that
No Way

Quit running your big mouth like you all that
Nobody catch ya ass when ya fall back
Bitch I look away, I never saw that
I was running through the trenches in a war mask
Stop looking at me like I was deranged (Okay)
Do you ever think I feel your pain? (No way)

Extraordinary specimen lit til the day I die
Smoke clouds help me float on by
I been high my whole god damn life
Even my momma couldn't tell me why

Why I'm such a sick motha fucka
Let me take a hit (Okay)
Now let me take another
I'm falling and I can't stand up
My dad used to tell me man up
Me and my brother put the gloves on
But now I'm too fucked up to function (No way)
I collapsed in the middle of the street just a block away

Acting like you're all that
Go fuck yourself

Woo
Okay
Like you all that
No Way

I'm all that and a little bit extra
Fuck the silon, bitch I'm next up
Recognize when you see my face
I could gain your shit while you walk away
Good luck, it's not your day
Maybe next year you can take a break
No way, don't follow me
Bitch, what you want, an apology?
You're a wannabe
I changed my number, stop calling me (Okay)
Google me if you wanna see but don't bother me (No way)
Honestly it's not hard for me, I go super hard
No joke, the kid just broke the wall going supercharging

Extraordinary specimen lit til the day I die
Smoke clouds help me float on by
I been high my whole god damn life
Even my momma couldn't tell me why

Bitch, stop acting like you're all that
