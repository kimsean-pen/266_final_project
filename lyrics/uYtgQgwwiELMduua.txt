Here we go again on a 747
Looking at the clouds from the other side of Heaven
Smoking and drinking, never gonna stop
Reading magazines stop me looking at the clock

Wanna watch the movie, can't sit still
Flying down to Rio, going to Brazil

Watching all the roadcrew attacking little girls
Joined the mile high club, goin' around the world
All the booze is free, airline going broke
Here come the lady with another Jack and Coke

Wanna watch the movie, can't sit still
Flying down to Rio, going to Brazil

Steve, Clem, Hobbsy, John, Crazy Dil and Pappy
Had to travel second class, they ain't too fucking happy
Elevator music, butter in my ears
Think we're gonna die, just the pilot changing gear

Wanna watch the movie, can't sit still
Flying down to Rio, going to Brazil
