On a crystal morning I can see the dewdrops falling
Down from a gleaming heaven, I can hear the voices call
When you comin' home now, son, the world is not for you

Tell me what's your point of view?

Hey there Mister Madman, what you know that I don't know
Tell me some crazy stories, let me know who runs this show
Glassy-eyed and laughing, he turns and walks away

Tell me what made you that way?

Here I am just waiting for a sign
Asking questions, learning all the time
It's always here, it's always there
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere, out of nowhere

Tell me now dear mother, what's it like to be so old
Children grown and leavin', seems the world is growin' cold
Though your body's ailin' you, your mind is just like new

Tell me where you're goin' to?

It's so simple lying right before your eyes
If you'll only look through this disguise
It's always here, it's always there
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere

Yeah

I sing this song a hundred, maybe a thousand years ago
No one ever listens, I just play and then I go
Off into the sunset like the western heroes do

Tell me what you're gonna do?

Here I am, I'm sure to see a sign
All my life I knew that it was mine
It's always here, it's always there
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere
Out of nowhere, out of nowhere
