Who builds a world upon a man?
My ship has sailed, this ship has sailed
It was loaded with jewels and gems
With my vices farewell for the best
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah
The careless knot I knew wouldn't hold pulled you out to open sea
Silence drained us on all that was gold, then you got the worst of me
Shout out at the top of my lungs, as loud the silent sea
Now watch as I slip away, slip away, ever
My hands untied as the sky be red
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
As empty as your open chest
I roam the hills deliriously
Walking in the shadows at the bottom of our ocean
They're drifting off to leave me clean
The careless knot I knew wouldn't hold pulled you out to open sea
Silence drained us on all that was gold, then you got the worst of me
Shout out at the top of my lungs as loud the silent sea
Spiralling out of control, I had to set you free
Now watch as I slip away, slip away, ever
My hands untied as the sky be red
The careless knot I knew wouldn't hold pulled you out to open sea
Silence lingers on all that was gold, then you got the worst of me
Now watch as I slip away, slip away here
With my hands untied as the sky be red
