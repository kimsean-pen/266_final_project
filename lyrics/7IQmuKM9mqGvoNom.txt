Well, it happened years ago
When you lived on Stanhope Road
We listened to your sister
When she came home from school
'Coz she was two years older
And she had boys in her room
We listened outside and heard her
Alright
Well, that was alright for a while
But soon I wanted more
I want to see as well as hear
And so I, I hid inside her wardrobe
And she came home 'round four
And she was with some kid called David
And from the garage up the road
I listened outside, I heard her

Alright
Oh, I want to take you home
I want to give you children

You might be my girlfriend, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When I saw you next day
I really couldn't tell
'Coz she might go and tell your mother
And so you went with Neve
Oh yeah, Neve was coming on
And I thought I heard you laughing

When his mum and dad were gone
I listened outside, I heard you

Alright
Oh, I want to take you home

I want to give you children
You might be my girlfriend, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Oh, I guess it couldn't last too long
I came home one day
And all her things were gone
I fell asleep inside
I never heard her come
Oh, I then opened up her wardrobe
And I had to look in it all, yeah

Oh, listen
We were on the bed when you came home
I heard you stop outside the door
I know you won't believe it's true

I only went with her 'coz she looks like you
My God!
Oh, I want to take you home
I want to give you children
You might be my girlfriend, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oww
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
