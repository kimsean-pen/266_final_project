Push my back so i make sure
You're right behind me as before
Yesterday the night before tomorrow
Dry my eyes so you won't know
Dry my eyes so i won't show
I know you're right behind me
And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
You walk the surface of this town
The high heels above the ground
And high horses that we know
Keep us safe until the night
You know them all, i know it all
Stay put and play along
'cause i'm looking for my friend
Now i got you, got you
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
I dry my eye
Dry my eye
Yeah
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Let me go, let me go
