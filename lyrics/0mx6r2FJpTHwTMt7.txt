I don't wanna know that it's true
I don't wanna know that it's true
I don't wanna know that it's true
I don't wanna know that it's true

My father was a man, was a man of the road
He drove a lot of nights, and he died alone

Have this little memory,
Mama said it's just a dream, feels so real
Left the truck so wait right there,
Honey come on don't be scared,
Eyes of a lost soul

I don't wanna know that it's true
I don't wanna know that it's true
I don't wanna know that it's true
I don't wanna know that it's true

My father was a man,
Was a man of the road
He drove a lot of nights,
And he died alone

Coulda been your heroin,
Didn't know how to tell you then,
Deep in an ugly world
Can never bring him back to you,
Sorry ma I wanted to,
Just a little girl

I don't wanna know that it's true
I don't wanna know that it's true
I don't wanna know that it's true
I don't wanna know that it's true

Coulda been your heroine
Coulda been your heroine
Coulda been your heroine
