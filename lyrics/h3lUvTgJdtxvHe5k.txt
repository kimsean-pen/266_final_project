Go, I'll wait behind
I'll take the burden 'cause you've taken mine
No, don't you cry
I'll take the verdict 'cause I've done the crime

I'm halfway out of New York
Half of me I left behind
If we've got something to say now is the time
Just give me a sign

Smoke fills your eyes
I'm down and no leader
And I'm losing time
Broke and in disguise
I'll come and meet you
And I'll change your mind

I'm halfway out of New York
And half of me I left behind
If we've got something to say then now is the time
Just give me a sign

Stay one more night
I'm hooked like a junkie, and I'm here to fight
You say you'll be mine
Oh the city is burning and I've seen the sign

I'm halfway out of New York
And half of me I left behind
If we've got something to say then now is the time

Once in a lifetime you might find
Something that you needed its right there you can see it
In the night time you might find
Something that you needed
Just give me a sign

Go, I'll wait behind
I'll take the burden 'cause you've taken mine
No, don't you cry
I'll take the verdict 'cause I've done the crime

I'm halfway out of New York
Half of me I left behind
If we've got something to say then now is the time
Just give me a sign
Just give me a sign
