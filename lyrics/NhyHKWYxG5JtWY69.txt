She waits sits astride
Mountains tall and wide
Serpent of earth writhes
Between glacial things

Holy nectar Flowing from celestial teat
Lips of blood and fire gorging on the sacred feast
Bounty of the goddess offered by the avatar
White blood spills with the singing of the scimitar

Holy nectar flowing from celestial teats
Lips of blood and fire gorging on the sacred feast
Bounty of the goddess offered by the avatar
White blood spills with the singing of the scimitars

Upward she flies
Over mountains tall and high
Winds blow her sighs
Through dark trees and black skies
