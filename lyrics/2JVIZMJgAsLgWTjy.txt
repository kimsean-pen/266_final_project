Last stop for a resolution.
End of the line, is it confusion? So go.
Go and see what's there for you.
Nothing new; nothing new for you to use.

I've got no new act to amuse you.
I've got no desire to use you, you know.
But anything that I could do
Would never be
Good enough for you.

If you can't help it, then just...
Leave it alone.
Leave it alone...
Yeah, just forget it.
It's really easy.
I believe I'll forget it too.

Still, you're keeping me around
'Til I finally drag us both down!
Pulling feathers out your hat...
Yes, I believe that's where it's at.

You belong tagging along,
And I belong in the zoo.

(Ahhhhhh...)

So I wait for confirmation
That you're never gonna use your starting gun.
Unless he's me, it sounds like
Being him just wasn't that much fun.

Anything that I could do
Would never be
Good enough for you.
If you can't help it, then just...
Leave it alone.
Leave me alone...
Yeah, just forget it.
It's really easy, I'll just forget it too.

Coast to coast... coast to coast...

I'll do what I can so you can be what you do.
Coast to coast... coast to coast...
I'll do everything I can so you can be what you do.
Coast to coast... coast to coast...

Circuit rider comes every fifth Sunday.
Oh my lord, I fell asleep one day.

Anything that I could do...
Is there anything that I could do,
That someone doesn't do for you?
That someone didn't do for you?
That I've already done for you?
