Know you got to run

Know you got to hide
Still there is a great life
Engrained deep within your eyes
Open up, open up
Baby let me in
You expect for me to love you
When you hate yourself my friend la la la ...

Everybody I love you
Everybody I do
(oh yeah)
Though your heart is an answer
I need your love to get through
(oh yea, I really do now)
When I tell you I love you
(when I tell you)
You can believe that it's true
(oh yes it is)

Everybody I love you
Everybody I do
(oh, yes I really do now...)
