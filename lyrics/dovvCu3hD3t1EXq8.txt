Sorry that
I could never love you back
I could never care enough
In these last days

Her tears
Fell on her pages found me out
On her words I dont know what
To do or say

Wading through
Warm canals and pools clear blue
The Tuscarawas flows into
The prairie land

Riding back
To where the highway met
Dead end tracks
The ground is now cement and glass
And far away

Heal her soul, carry her, my angel, ohio

Lingering in
What about the sweetness we knew
What about what's good what's true
From those days

Can't count to
All the lovers I've burned through
So why do I still burn for you
I cannot say

Sorry that
I could never love you back
I could never care enough in these last days

Heal her soul, carry her, my angel, ohio

Children blush
And gather round the home she rests
So poor and gold with their midwest
Moon and sun

Flashes bringing on
My open eyes the lightning storm
The tortured mist felt soft, felt warm
On my face

Craving dreams
A million miles ago you see
And the star that I just dont see
Anymore

Words long gone
Lost on journeys we walked on
Lost are voices heard along the way

Sorry for
Never going by your door
Never feeling love like that
Anymore

Heal her soul, carry her, my angel, ohio
