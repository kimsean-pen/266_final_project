Waikoloa Park
I first touched your skin
My heart still is not the same
We're throwing rocks off a cliffside
We're throwing rocks off a cliffside
We're throwing rocks off a cliffside
I wondered if you even knew my name
Never saw your face again
We're throwing rocks off a cliffside
We're throwing rocks off a cliffside
We're throwing rocks off a cliffside
I wish you well
As we grow old, you'll live on
We're throwing rocks off a cliffside
We're throwing rocks off a cliffside
We're throwing rocks off a cliffside
We're throwing rocks off a cliffside
We're throwing rocks off a cliffside
We're throwing rocks off a cliffside
We're throwing rocks off a cliffside
We're throwing rocks off a cliffside
