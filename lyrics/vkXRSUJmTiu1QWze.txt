Not In Love
Natalia Kills

Cherry Cherry Kills Kills

Thought that Cupid shot me with love
It was only an arrow
Just cause we ain't deep
Doesn't mean we can't enjoy the shallow

Never gonna make me want
Make me want
More than fun
If you wanna be the one
Be the one just for now

But we're not in love
No matter what
It's not enough
We're not in love.(2x)
It's not enough
We're not in love
It's not enough
We're not in love

Staring at the stars
Got the lights dimmed to feel a connection (the stars above, staring at the stars above)
Broke a couple hearts
But I'm not trying to start a collection (no were not in love, honey, girls don't fall in love)

Never gonna make me want it
Make me want it
More than fun
If you wanna be the one
Be the one just for now

But we're not in love
No matter what
It's not enough
We're not in love.(2x)
It's not enough
We're not in love
It's not enough
We're not in love

We're not in trust me
We're not in trust me
We're not in trust me
We're not in trust me

Never gonna make me want it
Make me want it
More than fun
If you wanna be the one
Be the one just for now

But we're not in love
No matter what
It's not enough
We're not in love.(2x)
It's not enough
We're not in love
It's not enough
We're not in love
