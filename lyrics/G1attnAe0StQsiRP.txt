Everyday is a gift, so live it
And put your all into it
You got one chance to do this
Trust your faith and don't you lose it

When darkness comes, bring the light
Look inside your heart, get through the night
Feel the thunder rise inside
It's time for the fire to reignite

Reignite
Reignite
Reignite
Reignite
Go against the grain
Bring the pain, this is my domain tonight
I'll bring you thunder like a motherfucking hurricane

(Hurricane)

(Go against the grain)
(Go, go against the grain)
(Go against the grain)
(Go, go against the grain)
Go against the grain
Bring the pain, this is my domain tonight
I'll bring you thunder like a motherfucking hurricane

Motherfucking hurricane
Hurricane

Everyday is a gift, so live it
And put your all into it
You got one chance to do this
Trust your faith and don't you lose it

When darkness comes, bring the light
Look inside your heart, get through the night
Feel the thunder rise inside
It's time for the fire to reignite

The elements of life can hit you like a freight train
It's a mind game, in a time frame
Face it and take it
Just believe you can make it
Gotta roar like a lion and choose the path of a champion
You're fucking indestructible

This is the thunder
Running through your veins
It feels like a hurricane
A hurricane

You got the thunder
Coming from within
It feels like a hurricane
A hurricane, yeah

(Go against the grain)
(Go, go against the grain)
(Go against the grain)
(Go, go against the grain)
Go against the grain
Bring the pain, this is my domain tonight
I'll bring you thunder like a motherfucking hurricane

Everyday is a gift, so live it
And put your all into it
You got one chance to do this
Trust your faith and don't you lose it

When darkness comes, bring the light
Look inside your heart and get through the night
Feel the thunder rise inside
It's time for the fire to reignite

Reignite
Reignite
Reignite
Reignite
Go against the grain
Bring the pain, this is my domain tonight
I'll bring you thunder like a motherfucking hurricane
