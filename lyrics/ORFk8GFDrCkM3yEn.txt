Some say that nothing lasts forever
But no one knows what happens when you die
So if this is all there is, it's now or never
Life's too short to not give it a try
So try your wings, find out if you can fly

Yeah

I don't wanna live my life doing stuff I don't like to do
I just wanna spend my time on creating something true
I don't wanna live my life just pretending what I'm not
I just wanna spend my time living my life on the spot

I've spent my last three years in college
As the oldest guy there I got my degree
And I guess it all gave me some kind of knowledge
But anyway I'm still just as naive
Hoping greener grass is still waiting there for me

I don't wanna live my life doing stuff I don't like to do
I just wanna spend my time on creating something true
I don't wanna live my life just pretending what I'm not
I just wanna spend my time living my life on the spot

It's not about the size of any wallet
(True brew we call it)
It's not about the fortune or the fame
(That's not our aim)
True brew is what we'd like to call it
It's a freedom both scary and lovely you want all the same
True brew will always be the aim

I just want to live for something true
I don't care if it's good enough for you
I just wanna create something true

I don't wanna live my life doing stuff I don't like to do
I just wanna spend my time on creating something true
I don't wanna live my life just pretending what I'm not
I just wanna spend my time living my life on the spot

'cause it's my true brew
This is my true brew, yeah
This is what I do
What I like to do
Don't care if it's good enough for you
