Worn out faces hanging on the wall
Foreign places, names you still recall
You say loud to yourself "why you just don't care?"
Say the things no one else will ever dare.

So pardon me for asking, pardon me for thinking
All of me is asking, all of me is thinking
So pardon me for asking, pardon me for thinking
All of me is asking, all of me is thinking

She said lie when you need it, cut off emotions
Do what you don't do
She said lie when you need it, cut off emotions
I'm in awe of you

So you lie to yourself
Why you're just not scared
All the things that you felt, were always there

So pardon me for asking, pardon me for thinking
All of me is asking, all of me is thinking
So pardon me for asking, pardon me for thinking
All of me is asking, all of me is thinking
So pardon me for asking, pardon me for thinking
All of me is asking, all of me is thinking

She said lie when you need it, cut off emotions
Do what you don't do
She said lie when you need it, cut off emotions
I'm in awe of you
