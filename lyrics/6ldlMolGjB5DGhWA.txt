Man walking a tightrope
Girl and her high hopes
Fall from the sky
Change of plans
Riding a cyclone
Dodging a headstone
I want what's mine

Right then the walls came falling
A voice came calling
The night it rained in LA
Mirror, ask me why
I don't act surprised

I'm on my way
One magic moment
Don't be late
I'm on my way
Salvation
My revelation
Arrives on vanity plates
I'm on my way

Smoke smothers a hillside
Blind in my mind's eye
My city's on fire
One more joke
Lacking a punchline
Realized sci-fi
I'm in denial

Right then the walls came falling
A voice came calling
The night it rained in your eyes
Mirror, ask me why
I don't act surprised

I'm on my way
One magic moment
Don't be late
I'm on my way
Salvation
My revelation
Arrives on vanity plates
I'm on my way

We go on about nothing
Just to talk about something
I'm on my way

I'm on my way
One magic moment
Don't be late
I'm on my way
Salvation
My revelation
Arrives on vanity plates
I'm on my way
One magic moment
Don't be late
I'm on my way
Salvation
My revelation
Arrives on vanity plates
I'm on my way

Ooh-ooh, yeah yeah
Ooh-ooh, yeah yeah
I'm on my way
