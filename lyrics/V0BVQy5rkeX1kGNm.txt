While everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
And there's a thousand ways you can skin it
My feet have been on the floor
Flat like an Idol singer
Remember Winger? I digress
I confess you are the best thing in my life
But I'm afraid when I hear stories about husband and wife
There's no happy endings, no Henry Lee
But you are the greatest thing about me

If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're 2 birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever

And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them 2 birds of a feather
That flock together

Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me

Took a loan on the house I own
Can't be a queen bee without a bee throne
I wanna buy you everything except cologne
'Cause it's poison
We can travel to Spain
Where the rain falls mainly on the plain
Sounds insane, 'cause it is
We can laugh, we can sing
Have ten kids and give 'em everything
Hold our cell phones up in the air
And just be glad that we made it here alive
On a spinning ball in the middle of space
I love you from your toes to your face

If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're 2 birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever

And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them 2 birds of a feather
That flock together

Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me

You can move in
I won't ask where you been
'Cause everybody has a past
When we're older
We'll do it all over again

When everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
I'm in it for you

If it's love
And we're 2 birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever

If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better

And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them 2 birds of a feather
That flock together

Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me
