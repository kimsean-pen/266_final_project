I got 10 black nails, Studded belt on my waist
Butterfly knife like a lullaby,
Like a lullaby, I'll send yo ass to paradise
She thought that she was dreamin when she seen me finally come outside
Shawty watchin me move side to side just like I hypnotize
Aye, now she mesmerized, said she wanna fuck with me
You ain't gotta do to much for me, just leave me satisfied
I got lots of time on me, so you know I can satisfy
I got all these racks on me, I got all this gasoline
All that shit don't mean a thing to me, my dreams are dead to me
Aye, Bitch you dead to me, shawty givin' head to me
Everybody hate me cuz I'm comin' up apparently
#1 underrated artist in this industry
Unappreciated, that's okay, cuz I'ma be alright
Sing this lullaby just one more time before I die tonight

I can't die tonight, you know I'ma ride with mine
Keep em by my side to feel alive until the end the of time
I can't die tonight, you know I'ma ride with mine
Keep em by my side to feel alive until the end the of time
Like a lullaby, let me be a lullaby
Shawty watchin me move side to side just like I hypnotize
Now she mesmerized, said she wanna fuck with me
You ain't gotta do to much for me, just leave me satisfied
I got lots of time on me, so you know I can satisfy
I got all these racks on me, I got all this gasoline
All that shit don't mean a thing to me, my dreams are dead to me
Aye, bitch you dead to me, shawty givin head to me
Like a lullaby, let me be a lullaby
Like a lullaby, let me be a lullaby
Like a lullaby, let me be a lullaby
Like a lullaby, let me be a lullaby
