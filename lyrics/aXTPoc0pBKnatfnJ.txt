I don't know how lost you are
But down this road, you'll fall apart

Never giving up, never giving up
Never giving up on you
Never giving up, never giving up
Never giving up on you

I wanna hold on to you
Black Velvet Sun
I wanna hold on until the shadows is gone
Wanna dance with you (you...)
Wanna dance with... (you...)

I wanna hold on to you
Black Velvet Sun,
Black Velvet Sun

Follow me out of the dark
I'll plant a seed in your frozen heart,
and I'll never giving up, never giving up,
Never giving up on you.
Never giving up, never giving up
Never giving up on you

Oh babe
I'll be the one holding on to you
Black Velvet Sun
I wanna hold on until the shadow is gone
Wanna dance with you (you...)
Wanna dance with (you...)
(I wanna dance with you)

I wanna hold on to you
Black Velvet Sun,
Black Velvet Sun!
Black Velvet Sun

I'm never gonna give you up,
I'm gonna pick you up and drag you to the top,
I'm gonna be there for you, be there for you...

Black Velvet...
Black Velvet...

I wanna hold on to you
Black Velvet Sun

Black Velvet...
Black Velvet...

I wanna hold into your shadows gone

Black Velvet...
Black Velvet...

I wanna hold on to you
Black Velvet Sun
