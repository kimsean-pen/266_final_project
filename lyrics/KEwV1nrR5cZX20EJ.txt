Ima' take the highway
No going down
No cutting out
The sun comes up before you go
My babies gone
My hollow soul
I feel cold wind start to blow
Every little stop sign
All the red lights like a preacher on a Saturday night
The devils in the details
Pretty little females
Tell me all your sweet sweet lies
I can't slow down it's so damn loud
Lets burn this town alive
Oh pocket full of moon shine
Countin' all the white lies
Time to take the highway highway highway
Woah
Baby take the highway
Ima' take the highway
My bleeding heart
It feels no pain
Too many sins to
Watch away
Into the dark
Into the rain
Together we go
We go insane
Every little stop sign
All the red lights like a preacher on a Saturday night
The devils in the details
Pretty little females
Tell me all your sweet sweet lies
I can't slow down its so damn loud
Lets burn this town alive
Oh pocket full of moon shine
Countin' all the white lies
Time to take the highway highway highway
Woah
Baby take the highway
Ima' take the highway
Every little stop sign
All the red lights like a preacher on a Saturday night
The devils in the details
Pretty little females
Tell me all your sweet sweet lies
I can't slow down its so damn loud
Lets burn this town alive
Oh pocket full of moon shine
Countin' all the white lies
Time to take the highway highway highway
Woah
Baby take the highway
Ima' take the highway
