I gave my cards away
I'd lose a game for you
Each second slipped away
Didn't know what to do

Was always drawing secrets on your wall
My clothes were always falling on your floor
My reckless heart could never be much more
Ooh-Ooh
I always snuck in late,
Running through the the front gate

Light, floating on a feather
Light landing on forever

Our trip surreal so high,
We flew right through the roof
Those nights you never came down
I stayed up needing you

Was always writing poems in math books
My idols were the clever fast crooks
This reckless heart could never be much more
Ooh-Ooh
I always snuck in late,
Rushing through the front gate

Light, floating on a feather
Light, landing on forever
