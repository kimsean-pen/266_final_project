Sea of Nothing

Drug Dealer

I know you wanted some of my fuel for your fire, honey
But I get so lazy
In the sea of nothing, baby

Try to sleep
But the thought of what you were missing meets you

Get so deep
On the shallowest of worry thinking

I know you wanted someone to fulfill your desire, buddy
And you keep on singing
That you've reached your highest tower

Try to peak
But the sun is just not that revealing

Get so deep
On the shallowest of worry thinking

I know you want to be somewhat of an originator
And you speak of spliffs
But all you got are rolling papers

Try to speak
But the thought of what you would say meets you

Get so deep
On the shallowest of hurry thinking
