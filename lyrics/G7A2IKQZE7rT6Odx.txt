Distant earthrise long ago
Lingers at the borders of our minds
Mysteries spinning in the dark
In the frozen emptiness of time
We were lost and we never knew
Who we were, what we left behind
Living half-lives we were blind
To the new frontiers that opened up our eyes

To find our minds were spinning
Souls entwined in a spiral dance
The ancient ways have found us again
To give us one last chance

Living in this place
Staring into space we find
We might share the corners of our lives
Infinity runs deep
Eternity that we can't keep
Melting through the frozen wastes of time

So we go and will not return
To navigate the seas of the sun
Our children will go on and on
To navigate the seas of the sun
So we go and will not return
We'll navigate the seas of the sun
Our children will go on and on
To navigate the seas of the sun

We can't go on tomorrow
Living death by gravity
Couldn't stand it anymore
We sail our ships to distant shores

Purple, gold and blue
Living colors every hue
Flowers in the garden of the gods
No one can ever know
If you never saw them grow
But this darkness is really full of light

Well beyond the Earth
Beyond all things that gave us birth
We'll navigate the seas of the sun
If god is throwing dice
And Einstein doesn't mind the chance
We'll navigate the seas of the sun
Infinity runs deep
Eternity that we can't keep
We'll navigate the seas of the sun
Flowers of our souls
Purple, blue and gold we find
To navigate the seas of the sun
So we know who we are
Even in this frozen waste
We'll navigate the seas of the sun
Living in this place
Staring into space we find
We'll navigate the seas of the sun
Well beyond the Earth
Beyond all things that gave us birth
We'll navigate the seas of the sun
If Einstein's throwing dice
And god he doesn't mind the chance
We'll navigate the seas of the sun
Flowers of the soul
Purple blue and gold we find
We'll navigate the seas of the sun
And who we were before
Eternity that we can't keep
We'll navigate the seas of the sun
Flowers of our souls
Purple blue and gold we find
