I swear that I'ma die in this basement
Isolation is the high that I'm chasing
Overdose on lonely nights, how I waste it
I can hear the reaper close, I hear him pacing
The days roll by, nothing changes
Sunset, sunrise, losing patience
I'm too far gone, don't try to save me
I hate myself more than any man could ever hate me

Alright, yeah
Alright, alright, no no
Alright, I'ma fade into the night
Cut you straight outta my life, yeah
Alright, yeah
Alright, alright, no no
Alright, this is the last time you see me
Call me young Houdini

Yeah, I'm cutting my ties and I'm closing the past
And I'm shutting my eyes, yeah
This life is a lie and I'm sick and I'm tired
Of the planet outside, I
Say that I'm fine, but you know that's a lie
And I mean to be stunting, yeah
I'm better alone, so don't hit up my phone
And I mean it
Disappear from the pain like I'm Dave Blaine
You know my name, you don't know me
'Cause it's been this way, keep it lowkey
Yeah you don't know the first thing about me
Abracadabra, I fucked up my life
If I did it once, I'll do it twice
Probably better if I stay away
Before my final night to fade away

Alright, yeah
Alright, alright, no no
Alright, I'ma fade into the night
Cut you straight outta my life, yeah
Alright, yeah
Alright, alright, no no
Alright, this is the last time you see me
Call me young Houdini

I've been away, don't say my name
Cut it out, cut it out, oh no
And you can try but it's no use
Cut it out, cut it out, ayy

Alright, yeah
Alright, alright, no no
Alright, I'ma fade into the night
Cut you straight outta my life, yeah
Alright, yeah
Alright, alright, no no
Alright, this is the last time you see me
Call me young Houdini
