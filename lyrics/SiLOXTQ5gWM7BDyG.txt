Flowers in your hair
You're slurring your speech
Saying all the things that
Now you really mean
Am I gonna let you
Take ahold of me?
'Cause if I let my guard down,
Will you bury me?
We could go on talking,
But what's it really mean?
Am I real to you?
Can you even feel me?
Or, am I just a shadow?
Another one you see?
'Cause fast, you cast your spells now
I can't stand or speak
Am I real?
Are you there?
Am I real?
Are you there?
Are you scared of what comes after this?
I'm terrified but I can handle it
