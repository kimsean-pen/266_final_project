Come on.
Lay down your head,
and sleep with me tonight,
lay in this bed.
Recall the black book, I'll forget you.
Complaining to myself to leave this,
behind my smile, will be a lie,
for why you are gone.
Come on have some selfless-ness,
don't give into arrogance.
Sleep with peace tonight,
(I'm waiting for the day)
We're gonna win this fight,
(you've found your better man,
I've been waiting for the day)
We're gonna win this fight.
Lay down your head,
and sleep with me tonight,
lay in this bed.
Lay down your head,
and sleep with me tonight,
lay in this bed.
Don't worry, I've let you go,
long before you left me.
