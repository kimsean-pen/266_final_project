Father who are in the sky
Hold thy hand above me
Mighty is the raging waves
On which I ride

Mother who awaits me ashore
Let your golden hair down
It will shine and guide me
Through the (raging) storm

Heading north after long a journey
We have sailed for so very long
Heavy seas endless sky above us
Heading north going home

Brother who fell in foreign land
Blessed thy soul a warriors
Living on through your sword
Now in my hand

Sister who for my return sings
Shed no more tears for my well
I can hear your voice clear now
In the wind

Heading north after long a journey
We have sailed for so very long
Heavy seas endless sky above us
Heading north going home

Heading north after long a journey
We have sailed for so very long
Heavy seas endless sky above us
Heading north going home

Heading north after long a journey
We have sailed for so very long
Heavy seas endless sky above us
Heading north going home

Heading north after long a journey
We have sailed for so very long
Heavy seas endless sky above us
Heading north going home
