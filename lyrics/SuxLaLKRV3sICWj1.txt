How many trains will make that
Where you can hear a nigga lurking on the streets
Like boom, boom, boom
I'm working on my third, you see
You still learning about the birds and bees
My nigga, you knew, knew, knew
We be up in here, just murdering beats
I had the landlord knocking like a burglary
Like boom, boom, boom
They'll bring a nigga 'round the world, you see
And tell me what your motherfuckers haven't heard of me
Like who, who, who

Started making a name and now they're knockin' it
Fuck the city up whenever we droppin' shit
Created a sound, they started jockin' it
Don't put on for the scene, 'cause we not in it
I'm not tryna make a scene
But is it still a scene if it's not heard or seen?
Don't worry about us, nigga, worry about your team
Tryna get this bread 'cause they say cash rules
And you know all of Parker's beats are cashews
Ain't nothin' but a thing
Put bass in your (coughing)
Put bass in your voice if you're gonna speak my name
Damn near 30, grown ass nigga
We a dynasty, word to Jigga
Rockin' and I'm rollin', driving like it's stolen
No sick calls, bro, I always go in
Still bumping Jill
Nigga, life is golden

How many trains will make that
Where you can hear a nigga lurking on the streets
Like boom, boom, boom
I'm working on my third, you see
You still learning about the birds and bees
My nigga, you knew, knew, knew
We be up in here, just murdering beats
I had the landlord knocking like a burglary
Like boom, boom, boom
They'll bring a nigga 'round the world, you see
And tell me what your motherfuckers haven't heard of me
Like who, who, who

Me, I ain't fuckin' with none of that chit-chat
That he-say, she- say shit about this cat
'Well I ain't heard he had a-'
Nigga, just get back
That old, white nigga saying, 'Oh, I don't do the rap thing
But I can actually understand you, I dig that
And you don't talk about the guns and you flip crack.'
Well, listen up, Baxter
Well, see, I get that
But we won't agree on as much as you think, Jack
And then we got the old head's going
'What's up with the ghost-writing thing, my nigga?
I don't get that. See, back in my day, you had to write and
Spit raps.' Isn't Ice Cube writing 6'4" and Known Facts?
They even put in a movie, nigga, explain that
That's no shade, they ain't even try and go change that
And here we go back again with all that chit-chat
The he-say, she-say, nigga just spit raps

How many trains will make that
Where you can hear a nigga lurking on the streets
Like boom, boom, boom
I'm working on my third, you see
You still learning about the birds and bees
My nigga, you knew, knew, knew
We be up in here, just murdering beats
I had the landlord knocking like a burglary
Like boom, boom, boom
They'll bring a nigga 'round the world, you see
And tell me what your motherfuckers haven't heard of me
Like who, who, who
