I am the lonely one
But I could be lone
And you are the only one
In radio swamp
This is the aftermath
For whatever I've done
Am I the only one
Still holding on

Simple plee:
Make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me
Oh, make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me

A Judais Iscariot
Throwing you rope
And on the radio
Selling you dough
Oh you're so afraid of me
But I could be loved oh, are we so tired of yourself?
In love with the radio

Simple plee:
Make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me
Oh, make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me

This heart it burns in raging fire
I'm locking all my tears inside
No more time to sweep the floor, only time to watch it burn
And I know, now
I've seen it through the flames, living off fire
and God I know I'm better off

Simple plee:
Make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me
Oh, make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me

Hope is a terminal,
featureless smoke,
love is a stallion,
love is a joke.
But fate is hilarious
That's what he wants
Swinging truck and a hitch from the rafters,
Dragging his tail through the swamp
Simple plee:
Make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me
Simple plee:
make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me
Oh, make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me.
