Enveloped in entropy
A swirling torrent of imagery
An implanted contagion
Wrenches my mind from its foothold in sanity

I have become a victim
Of a world fragmented and askew
Vivid hallucinations
Seep into all that I do

Helpless I writhe
Conduit of eyes
Reaching into my mind
Entities pry
Discordant forms arise
Ethereal sprites

Imperial towers
Luminescent shine
Gaining in power
Through gates I arrive
Outside of space and time
Endlessly changing

Flashes of clarity lost in a whirlwind
My sensory apparatus now blasted
Stumbling I desperately cling to my consciousness
Cacophonous visuals twisted and fractal
Total liquefaction of my optic sense
Flesh twisted into deformities grotesque
