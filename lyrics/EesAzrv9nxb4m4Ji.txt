What you learned
what you read in their books
all they offered
what you saw when they told you to look
a final offer
well today we are giving birth
to a new future
yes today we are giving birth
to our own future

we will learn
we will love
we will work
to change each other
we will spread
we will cover the earth
like air and water (water! water! water!) (change each other)
we will spread
we will cover the earth
like air and water

tomorrow is blank well just fill it in
with our little answers
if we are stopped well just start again
that is the new offer
that's it
that's it
that is our final one.
