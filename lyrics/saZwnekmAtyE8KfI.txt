Blame it on the Tetons yeah I need a scapegoat now
No my dog won't bite you though it had the right to
You oughta give her credit
Cause she knows I would've let it happen

Blame it on the weekends God I need a Cola now
Oh we mumble loudly, wear our shame so proudly
Wore our blank expressions tryin' to look interestin'
Blame it all on me cause God I need a cold one now

All them eager actors gladly taking credit
For the lines created by the people tucked away from
Sight is just a window from the room we're bound to
If you find a way out, oh would you just let me know how
Would you just let me know how

Blame it on the web but The spider's your problem now
Language is the liquid that we're all dissolved in
Great for solving problems after it creates a problem
Blame it on the Tetons God I need a scapegoat now

Everyone's a building burning with no one to put the fire out
Standing at the window looking out waiting for time to burn us down
Everyone's a ocean drowning with no one really to show how
They might get a little better air if they turned themselves into a cloud
