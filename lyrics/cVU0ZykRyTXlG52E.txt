Everyday after day, another question for you
If I could go back in time I'd find a reason for you
The more I seem to try, another secret lies
Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and no more make the same mistakes
Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and no more make the same mistakes
Set fire to the night, see ashes fall

Set fire to the night, like into the night
Set fire to the night, leave none behind
Set fire to the night, set fire to the night
Every end has a start just like a dream comes true
It won't be long till you'll find the feeling inside you

Before we walk, we crawl, but we can only try
Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and no more make the same mistakes
Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and no more make the same mistakes

Set fire to the night, see ashes fall
Set fire to the night, like into the night

Set fire to the night, leave none behind
Set fire to the night, set fire to the night
Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and no more make the same mistakes
Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want

Walk away, from the flame, and no more make the same mistakes
Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and no more make the same mistakes
Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and no more make the same mistakes
Set fire to the night, see ashes fall
Set fire to the night, like into the night
Set fire to the night, leave none behind
Set fire to the night, set fire to the night
Set fire to the night, see ashes fall
Set fire to the night, like into the night
Set fire to the night, leave none behind
Set fire to the night, set fire to the night
