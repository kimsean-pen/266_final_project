Different lives in different places
Familiar problems same old faces
Shuffled lives into wrong categories
Cross the wires and fuse humanities

Watch the muscles twitch
For a brand new switch

Scientist G.P.'s
With patient guinea-pigs
Curing their head-aches
With drastic side-effects
With drastic side-effects

Doctor rectorates, rectorates
Condescending from on high
For all hallucinates
See druggist in the sky
In the sky

Vicar experiments
But 'tis blasphemy
Dismissing thought of progress
As the mark of devilry
As the mark of devilry

Watch the muscles twitch
For a brand new switch

People walk and even talk
People listen then they halt
Something blows up won't come down
Scattered muscles twitch too late to switch

They're dying to switch
They're dying to switch
Switch switch
Watch the muscles twitch
For a brand new switch

They're dying to switch
They're dying to switch
Switch
Watch the muscles twitch
For a brand new switch

They're dying to switch
They're dying to switch
Switch switch switch switch
