And now summer is gone and
we are drunk in love
But you're going away
Boy, don't get me wrong, I'm just a girl in love

And I want you to stay
So just fool me, fool me, fool me that is all I'm asking for
Here to watch your body tempo cause you won't be here no more
Can't you see my heart is beating like it never did before?

You're the one
Tried to keep my heart from falling, yeah

Oh, no way to resist it, no
And now summer is gone and we are drunk in love
But you're going away
Boy, don't get me wrong, I'm just a girl in love

And I want you to stay
So just fool me, fool me, fool me that is all I'm asking for
Here to watch your body tempo cause you won't be here no more
Can't you see my heart is beating like it never did before?

You're the one
I am dreaming of a life where I will let you know
Why I love you so
Cause I'm melting in your eyes
I can let you know, why can't I let you go?
So just fool me, fool me, fool me that is all I'm asking for
Here to watch your body tempo cause you won't be here no more
Can't you see my heart is beating like it never did before?
You're the one
