Somewhere my love there will be songs to sing
Although the snow covers the hope of Spring
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold
And there are dreams, all that your heart can hold

Someday we'll meet again, my love
Someday whenever the Spring breaks through

You'll come to me, out of the long-ago
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow
Lara, my own, think of me now and then
Godspeed, my love, till you are mine again

Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow

Godspeed, my love, till you are mine again
