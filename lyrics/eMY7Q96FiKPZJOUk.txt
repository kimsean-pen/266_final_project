pleasure dome
now i know none of this was planned, it all just kinda happened
i got more than i wanted, but how is still a mystery
obsessed with this feeling, i trusted it, so i followed it
i'm tripping and stumbling across the land, full of miracles
into a world so far from home, miles and miles from nowhere
rooms without doors open for me, oh no
taking me miles and miles from nowhere
oh (miles and miles), oh yeah
lost in this pleasure dome, lost in my own pleasure dome
oh man, i ain't got a clue, how you get out, or how to find this place
i want my control back, but i'm afraid, i'll lose that feeling
lost in a world so far from home, i'm miles and miles from nowhere
falling inside my own pleasure dome, i'm miles and miles from nowhere
oh (miles and miles), oh yeah
lost in this pleasure dome, lost inside my pleasure dome
(solo)
lost in a world, can't find my way home, miles and miles from nowhere
falling inside my own pleasure dome, miles and miles from nowhere
millions of miles, oh no, miles and miles and miles from nowhere
miles and miles and miles and miles, oh
lost in this pleasure dome, lost inside my pleasure dome, yeah
lost, lost
