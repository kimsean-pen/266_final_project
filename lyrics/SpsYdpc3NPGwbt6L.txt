Mad in love for levitation
Heartbreak coming down
And it's lucky for me I don't mind
Waiting patient
Growing the flower from the ground
There's just one thing that I've been dreaming of
The way we did before
Holding hands like could say this was the end

Is this the end of life worth living
Is this the end of heart won't give in
Is this the end
I wanna know, I wanna love
I want a new beginning

Back in the day when I was so helpless
You gave me your hand, I gave you dirt
And if you give me a chance, I want a life
I want to thank you for pulling me back from the brink
Oh, come on lover, don't say it's done
Go pray for something more
Like an angel would pay to paint the floor

Is this the end of life worth living
Is this the end of heart won't give in
Is this the end
I wanna know, I wanna love
I want a new beginning

'Cause I spent my life just fending off something I said or done
Encircles in a moment, been and gone
It's just one thing that I am certain on, the highway I belong
Open ended as a wizard to the sun

Is this the end of
Is this the end of

Is this the end of life worth living
Is this the end of heart won't give in
Is this the end
I wanna know, I wanna love
Is this the end
