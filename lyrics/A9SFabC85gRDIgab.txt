This is for the people that want you
This is for the people that want you
This is for the people that want you
Get high on violence baby
President dead is clueless
And he's, caught in a head-lock police state
God and scalding stained glass
Incubated and get set to let our
Fingers buy the tickets to go find
God like a piggy in a fair

And we don't want to live live forever
And we know that suffering is so much better
This is for the people that want you
This is for the people that want you
This is for the people that want you

Get high on violence baby

Give the pills down to but we
All could be modern in the
Winter of our discontent
Get high on violence baby
Every night we are nailed into place and
Every night we just can't seem to
Ever remember the reason why
Get high on violence baby
And we don't want to live forever
And we know that suffering is so much better
This is for the people that want you
This is for the people that want you

This is for the people that want you
Get high on violence baby

And we don't want to live live forever
And we know that suffering is so much better
And we don't want to live live forever
And we know that suffering is so much better
And we don't want to live live forever
And we know that suffering is so much better
