Cold and long, endless road,
Oh brother, where do we go?
White clouds in the sky,
Why do birds leave their home?

Away from places where once we felt alone
Following the light of early stars
So dark in the night
Whistling the melody of my life
Sitting in front of the fire

Far away from home
Oh father, where do I go?
Lighthouse of my land
I'll remember until the end

Away from places where once I felt alone
Following the light of brightest stars
So cold in the night
Whistling my only melody
And sleeping in front of the fire

Warm memory
Your hands in my hands again
Young memories
Your head on my chest again
