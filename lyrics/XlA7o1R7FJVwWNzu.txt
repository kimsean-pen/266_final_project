he hit me
and it felt like a kiss
he hit me
but it didn't hurt me

he couldn't stand to hear me say
that I had been with someone new
and when i told him i had been untrue

he hit me
and it felt like a kiss
he hit me
and i knew he loved me

if he didn't care for me
i could have never made him mad
but he hit me
and I was glad

yes, he hit me
and it felt like a kiss
he hit me
and I knew I loved him
and when he took me in his arms
with all the tenderness there is
and when he kissed me
he made me his
