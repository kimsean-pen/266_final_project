Twisting the strangle grip won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip torn up and mean

Twisting the strangle grip won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip torn up and mean
Blastmaster racks the ground bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down a deadly scream

All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing

Forced into overdrive drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped impaling spike
Heart pounding fever pitch blood pumping fury
Two fisted dynamo eager to strike

All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing

Cross cutting thundercharge blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane destroys the cage
Bone crushing alien God of salvation
Sad wings that heaven sent wipes out in rage

All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
