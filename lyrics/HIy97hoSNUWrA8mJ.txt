I am the Ghost of Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
I am the Ghost of Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
I am the Ghost

Faces in my dreams
Of distant strangers
Remind me I can never
Change the time
Spirit haunt the streets
That are abandoned
My hometown never feelt
That much like home

Cuz I've gone too far
And I've lost my way
I am the Ghost of Ohio
I am the Ghost of Ohio

I am the Ghost of Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
I am the Ghost of Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
I am the Ghost

Looking back on who
I used to be then
I ran away from
Everything I've know
Maybe we could stay here
For a little while
And fine a neighborhood
I haven't roamed

Cuz I've gone too far
And I've lost my way
I am the Ghost of Ohio
I am the Ghost of Ohio

I am the Ghost of Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
I am the Ghost of Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
I am the Ghost
I am the Ghost of Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
I am the Ghost
I am the Ghost of Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
I am the Ghost

Nothing is the same
As I remember,
Or is it that my memories
Have changed?

I am the Ghost of Ohio
I am the Ghost of Ohio

I am the Ghost of Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
I am the Ghost of Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
I am the Ghost
I am the Ghost of Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
I am the Ghost
I am the Ghost of Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
I am the Ghost

Cuz I've gone too far
And I've lost my way

(He's the Ghost of Ohio)
