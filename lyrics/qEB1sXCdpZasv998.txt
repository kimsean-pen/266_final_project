The good thing in my life
Has gone away
I don't know why
She's gone away
I don't know where
Somewhere I can't follow her

The one good thing (hey, hey, hey) didn't stay too long
(Woo who, who, who)
My back was turned (hey, hey, hey) and she was gone

Good thing
Where have you gone?
(Doo, doo doobie doo)
My good thing you've been gone too long
(Good thing)
(Doo, doo doobie doo)

People say I should forget
New friend tomorrow
Don't get upset
People say she's doing fine
Mutual friends I see sometime

That's not what (hey, hey, hey) I want to hear
(Woo who, who, who)
I want to hear (hey, hey, hey) she wants me near

Good thing
Where have you gone?
(Doo, doo doobie doo)
My good thing
You've been gone too long
(Good thing)
(Doo, doo doobie doo good thing)

Then one day she came back
I was so happy that I didn't act
Morning came (hey, hey, hey) into my room
(Woo who, who, who)
Caught me dreaming (hey, hey, hey) like a fool

Good thing
My good thing
(Doo, doo doobie doo)
My, my, my, my, my good thing
Where have you gone?
(Good thing)
(Doo, doo doobie doo)
My good thing
Hey, hey my good thing
(Doo, doo doobie doo good thing)
Girl
Where have you gone?
(Good thing)
(Doo doo doobie doo good thing)
It's been so long
Good God girl!
(Doo, doo doobie doo good thing)
Good God girl!
Good God girl!
(Good thing)
(Doo, doo doobie doo good thing)
Good God!
(Doo, doo doobie doo good thing)
Good god!
(Doo, doo doobie doo good thing)
Good god!
