Now that it's over i can finally see
That all things must change and remain
Like i know you do, oh
People come and go
There is something you should know
Please don't explain
It's the same refrain
Yes it might be strange
Love can get changed
You make my thoughts come alive
Now im here to stay
Not to play these games
Nothing is for sure
I'd rather let you go
All things must change and remain
