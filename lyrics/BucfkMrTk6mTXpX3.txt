I think I might have have killed you
Or at the very least, I wore you down
You don't always mean to
Call me up when I'm in town
But it's just too easy
To lose track of morals in those rooms that we don't own
And it all comes down to fear of being alone

I'm devastated, I'm wasted
I'm trying hard to contain it
But I'm too burnt out
And dying for a change

Pure, you looked so pure
And there was something in your eyes that looked so pure

I remember walking home with you fucked up
And drink spilled down my shirt
You weren't in love with me, just with my words
And I shouldn't have to be the one who
Admits that I was wrong
'Cause you were wrong too
But I come crawling back to you

So medicated, I'm wasted
You're trying hard just to hate me
And I know you're burned out
Praying things don't change

Pure, you looked so pure
And there was something in your eyes that looked so pure
You know, something in your eyes that looked so pure

I think I might have have killed you
At the very least I wore you down
You don't always mean to
Call me up when I'm around
And I almost killed you
I can see you slowly breaking down
You don't always mean to
Call me up when I'm in town

You're devastated that I'm wasted
Sick of trying hard to contain it
When I'm too burned out
Dying for a change

Pure, you looked so pure
And there was something in your eyes that looked so pure
And there was something in your eyes that looked so
