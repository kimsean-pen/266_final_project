They said I was fucked in the head
And dragged me out of my house
Later on on the way to your school
Left my body on the side of the road

Now you've come back into my life
It's like all the dreams I had have come true
I fell asleep in my car one night
And never woke up, never woke up

You said I was fucked in the head
I'll never leave my bed again
I'm not made for the life I have
I never meant to hurt anyone
