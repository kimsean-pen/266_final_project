Red Cardinals in the white snow
They got too high to fly home for the winter
I had a roomate was he got so high
he couldnt go out at night
So he found love on the internet
And its freezing in pennsylvania
And the rest of trhe birds are turjks and kaicos
And hes like a truth commercial,
but we feel bad
so we get stoned and do snow angels
(Whistling)

We bought a brokedown bus and we painted it green
And we danced in the parking lot under the shadow of '95
and all of my favorite people
They dont march to the beat of your drum
They just keep on keeping on
And whatever youre supposed to be
Whatever thats supposed to mean

I just wanted you to know that you dont have to come clean to me'
Yea everything is exactly, everything is exactly where its supposed to be,
I just wanted you to know that you dont have to come clean to me.
Everything is exactly where it needs to be
