You better call me a doctor, feelin' no pain
Overloaded, down the drain

Somebody get me a doctor

You better call up the ambulance I'm, deep in shock
Overloaded baby, I can hardly walk

Somebody get me a doctor (Ooh)
Somebody get me a doctor

Yeah! I'm feelin' over fine
And I'm speedin', down that line

(Woo-woo)

(Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Woo)
(Oh, woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo)

(Ow)
(Ooh)

Ya better call up a doctor, feelin' high
I'm overloaded baby, I say "Bye-bye"

Somebody get me a doctor (Oh, yeah)
Somebody get me a doctor (Ooh, ooh)
Somebody get me a doctor (Ah, yeah)
(Ooh)

Somebody give me a shot
