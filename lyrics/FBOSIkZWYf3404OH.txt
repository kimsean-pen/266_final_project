I worked my feelings out
I sing the words I'd like to shout
And it comes as no surprise
You've changed the rules again

We came here starry eyed
We went away dissatisfied
And it comes as no surprise
It comes as no surprise

I give my thoughts to you
Don't ask for more
We've shared some moments
But that's really all
And in my heart
I fear you need much more

The sun won't rearrange
A passion still resisting change
And I hope you realize
We've both been fooled the same
Your heart's an open book
You're too afraid to take a look
And I hope you realize
Yes I hope you realize

I give my thoughts to you
Don't ask for more
We've shared some moments
But that's really all
And in my heart
I fear you need much more

We were lost in a moment
Maybe you didn't notice

I give my thoughts to you
Don't ask for more
We've shared some moments
But that's really all
And in my heart
I fear you need much more

My burning senses shout a melody too strong to doubt
And it comes as no surprise
You've missed the point again
We came here starry eyed
But now it seems those stars have died
And it comes as no surprise
Well it comes as no surprise

I give my thoughts to you
Don't ask for more
We've shared some moments
But that's really all
And in my heart
I fear you need much more

Maybe you didn't notice
We've lost it all
