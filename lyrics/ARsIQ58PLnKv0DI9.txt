Traped in this wicked mind
Relax its a matter of time
The end seems to far
I've tried so fucking hard

Goddamn I can't escape
Since birth blessed with this curse
Back to this place again

These eyes on the back of my mind
It's only a matter of time
... voices in my head
I think it's time I up and left
I wish I shut the door
I wish I had it all
I up and left

Cast...
These street I'll never escape
The end when I come
It's been so fucking long
How long will I have to wait
I know you can't relate
I want to be alone
It's about time i walked...

...I'm doing time
Nothings ok - it'll never be ... fine
Too many times in this fucking place
What is next? Bring forth THE END! OH!
