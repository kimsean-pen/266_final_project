Take me away from the demons in my brain
Take me out to the world
Take me out into the day
And let me find
My peace of mind

I was alone
I was taken with the tide
But I knew that I was home
When I looked into your eyes and said I'm done
Just let me go

I am hollow
I am numb
I am staring down the barrel of this gun
I am always by myself
In a sea of self infliction that I felt

My life is a line burning faster every time
Happy is just a dead-end street
I must turn around and leave once in a while
Once in a while

I bear far more cracks
Than the human I can see
Is it fair to be perplexed
And try explain what's underneath with my success?
'Cause there's nothing left

I am tortured by myself
I am haunted by the fear of someone else
I am fading, I'm a ghost
Disconnected from the things I love the most

You've seen my best turn to the worst
I've dragged you right down with me
Want to confess
But with the stress
I'm scared you'll leave me
Now I want you to know
But you can take it on your own

I am hollow
I am numb
I am staring down the barrel of this gun
I am always by myself
In a sea of self infliction that I felt
