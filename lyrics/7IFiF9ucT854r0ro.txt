It's Saturday
I finally got you to myself on your off day
Oh yeah
I know a place
Where we can shut the whole world out and hide away
Away

See the cold drinks have a sweeter taste
Whenever you're around, whenever you're around
And the bedsheets feel a different way
And it feels good, slowin' down touch(?)
Whenever you're around me
Whenever you're around
And it should babe, come as no surprise

I like it better with you
There's nothing that compares to your company
I like it better with you
You come around and change how I'm seeing things
Oh yeah

So baby don't you run away, run away, run away
'Cause I just wanna stay, I do
I like it better with you
There's nothing that compares to your company
I like it better with you

A city night
Is so enticing, but I'd rather stay inside
With you
So lay beside
Me and do all the things we wanna try
Oh yeah

See the cold drinks have a sweeter taste
Whenever you're around, whenever you're around
And the bedsheets feel a different way
And it feels good, slowin' down, touch (?)
Whenever you're around me
Whenever you're around
And it should babe, come as no surprise

I like it better with you
There's nothing that compares to your company
I like it better with you
You come around and change how I'm seeing things
Oh yeah

So baby don't you run away, run away, run away
'Cause I just wanna stay, I do
I like it better with you
There's nothing that compares to your company
I like it better with you

Traffic ain't bad when you're here with me
I even love the rain when you're here with me
I don't really care what we do, long as I'm there wit' you, baby
Traffic ain't bad when you're here with me
I even love the rain when you're here with me
I don't really care what we do

I like it better with you
There's nothing that compares to your company
I like it better with you
You come around and change how I'm seeing things
Oh yeah

So baby don't you run away, run away, run away
'Cause I just wanna stay, I do
I like it better with you
There's nothing that compares to your company
I like it better with you
