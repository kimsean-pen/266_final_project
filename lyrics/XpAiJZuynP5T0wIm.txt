When we were together
We were just strangers
I was just playing around
So I didn't wanna work it out
No, I didn't wanna work it out

Thought something was missing
And we were too different
Baby, I'm looking back now
And I really should've worked it out
Yeah, I really should've worked it out

Because, now that you're gone
And I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back
'Cause I

Boy, I miss you
Said I really do
Boy, I miss you
Now I understand that we're better together

Boy, I miss you
Said I really, really do
Boy, I miss you
Now I understand that we're better together

We're better, we're better, we're better
We're better, we're better
You know we're better together

We're better, we're better, we're better
We're better, we're better
You know we're better together

I'm watching you with her
Thinking I had ya
How was I ever so dumb
Boy, I should've known that you're the one
Boy, I should've known that you're the one

So if it's not too late
I just wanna know
Tell me if we could still run
'Cause I finally know that you're the one
Yeah, I really know that you're the one

Because now that you're gone
And I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back
'Cause I

Boy, I miss you
Said I really do (said I really do)
Boy, I miss you
Now I understand that we're better together

Boy, I miss you (I miss you)
Said I really, really do
Boy, I miss you
Now I understand that we're better together

We're better, we're better, we're better
We're better, we're better
You know we're better together

We're better, we're better, we're better
We're better, we're better
You know we're better together

Now that you're gone
And I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back
'Cause I

We're better, we're better, we're better
We're better, we're better
You know we're better together

We're better, we're better, we're better
We're better, we're better
You know we're better together

Boy, I miss you (you know I miss you)
Said I really do (said I really do)
Boy, I miss you
Now I understand that we're better together

Boy, I miss you
Said I really, really do
Boy, I miss you
Now I understand that we're better together

We're better, we're better, we're better
We're better, we're better
You know we're better together

We're better, we're better, we're better
We're better, we're better
You know we're better together
