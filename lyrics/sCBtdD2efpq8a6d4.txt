So I might slip again
Let it in now and then
That don't mean anything, I'm still good

I look around me
How did I get here?
Not part of my plan
I ended up in a situation
Wasn't in my hands

I think about it
When I wanna give up
How to keep on goin'
How to keep my chin up
Somehow I know it
I'm not gonna give up
Never gonna give up

So I might slip again
Let it in now and then
That don't mean anything, I'm still good
Tryin' to be my best
When I fall in some mess
Pick myself up again, I'm still good
I'm still good, I'm still good

When days are like that
And I can't shake 'em
It's weighing on my mind
So, I'm just sayin'
I'm only human
Life gets you down sometimes

I think about it
When I wanna give up
How to keep on goin'
How to keep my chin up
Somehow I know it
I'm not gonna give up
Never gonna give up

So I might slip again
Let it in now and then
That don't mean anything, I'm still good
Tryin' to be my best
When I fall in some mess
Pick myself up again, I'm still good

So I might slip again
Let it in now and then
That don't mean anything, I'm still good
Tryin' to be my best
When I fall in some mess
Pick myself up again, I'm still good

Life puts up a fight with me
But I can take on anything
I'm gonna make it real
This dream I believe in

I think about it
When I wanna give up
How to keep on goin'
How to keep my chin up
Somehow I know it
I'm not gonna give up
Never gonna give up

So I might slip again
Let it in now and then
That don't mean anything, I'm still good
Tryin' to be my best
When I fall in some mess
Pick myself up again, I'm still good

So I might slip again
Let it in now and then
That don't mean anything, I'm still good
Tryin' to be my best
When I fall in some mess
Pick myself up again, I'm still good

I'm still good
Pick myself up again
I'm still good
I'm still, I'm still good
