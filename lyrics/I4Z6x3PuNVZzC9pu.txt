The least wishes are orders
Born raised and cornered
Was kept fed and watered
They tied me to the radiators

I was, kicked around and locked down
Left in the cold to self harm
This is all that I know
Naked but safe and lifelessly yours

The least wishes are orders
Born raised and cornered
Was kept fed and watered
They tied me to the radiators

I was, kicked around and locked down
Left in the cold to self harm
This is all that I know
Naked but safe and lifelessly yours

Keep me fed, keep me watered
Naked but safe
Keep me fed, keep me watered
Naked but safe
Keep me fed, keep me watered
Naked but safe
Keep me fed, keep me watered
Naked but safe

Naked but safe
Naked but safe
Naked but safe

Keep me fed, keep me watered
Keep me fed, keep me watered
Keep me fed, keep me watered
Keep me fed, keep me watered
