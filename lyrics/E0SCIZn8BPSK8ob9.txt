The winds of fortune
Don't blow the same
She had to get out
And make a change
She had a kid now
But much too young
That baby daddy's

Out having fun
He said: "I'm on a roll. With all the girls I know"
His baby mama
She ain't so slow
He said: "I'm on a roll. With all the girls I know"
I know you wanna hit that
I know you wanna hit that, hit that
All of the world is getting with, I say
Consequences are a lot, but hey!
That's the way
That's the way things go
Oh, oh, oh!

What was a family
Is now a shell

We're raising kids now
Who raise themselves
Sex is a weapon
It's like a drug
It gets around into that grave that he just dug
She said: "I'm on the run. I'm chasing guys for fun"
Her baby daddy

It ain't his only one
She said: "I'm on the run. I'm chasing guys for fun"
I know you wanna hit that
I know you wanna hit that, hit that
Everybody's getting with, I say
Consequences are a lot, but hey
That's the way
That's the way things go
Oh, oh oh!

Well then wise up
Broken up
It's really such a shame
But why not?
Take a chance, everything's a game

And it don't stop
Broken up
Nothing's gonna change, well
The more he's trying
The more he's buying
He says: "I'm on a roll. With all the girls I know"
His baby mama
Don't need to know

He said, "Now I'm on a roll. With all the girls I know"
I know you wanna hit that
I know you wanna hit that, hit that
All of the world is getting with, I say
Consequences are a lot, but hey
That's the way
That's the way things go
