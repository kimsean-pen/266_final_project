It starts with pain
Followed by hate
Fueled by the endless questions
No one can answer
A stain covers your heart
And tears you apart
Just like a sleeping cancer

No I don't believe men are born to be killers
I don't believe that the world can't be saved
How did you get there and when did it start
An innocent child with a thorn in his heart

What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Losing control of our feeling
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold

Are you sane
Where is the shame
A moment of time passes by
You cannot rewind
Who's to blame
And where did it start
Is there a cure for your sickness
Have you no heart

No I don't believe men are born to be killers
I don't believe that the world can't be saved
How did you get here and when did it start
An innocent child with a thorn in his heart

What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Losing control of our feeling
We're dreaming this life away
What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Selling our soul for no reason
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold

There's a sickness inside you that wants to escape
It's a feeling you get when you can't find your way
So how many times must you fall to your knees
Never, never, never, never
Never do this again

It starts with pain
Followed by hate

No I don't believe men are born to be killers
I don't believe that the world can't be saved

What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Losing control of our feeling
We're dreaming this life away
What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Selling our soul for no reason
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold
In a world so cold
