Mind overlaid, I place my fingers through a figure of eight
And follow backwards intentions to accommodate.
When I found out I made sense
It meant nothing else, ever quite did the same again.

Float in, float out, through the clarity
While energy condenses and the majesty
Comes crashing down.

And it leaves my head scattered a mess, in One million pieces.
I really couldn't care less, when I still take breaths, and I am still featured
Among my reality
All things seem slow, when I am decreasing
My visions with manic intentions
Are still haunting my interest
Yet the show goes on without me.

I took a little seed from nature
Made a plant evolve
And in return I'm hoping that I won't be stoned
Rather get stoned with antelopes
And read them their horoscopes before they get high hopes.

It might be easy to ignore, I have seen it before
Try and remember to remember remembering more
Cause I completely forgot
I was so lost inside his head when I was looking for my thoughts

Head scattered a mess, in one million pieces
I really couldn't care less, when I still take breaths, and I am still featured
Among my reality
All things seem slow, when I am decreasing
My visions with manic intentions
Are still haunting in my interest
Yet the show goes on without me (without me, without me)
