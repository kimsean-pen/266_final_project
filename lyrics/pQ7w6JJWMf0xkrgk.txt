あなたを愛しております
生涯かけて、
あなた様だけを愛しております
今、あなたのもとへ参ります

Baby when I dream of you
Kiss my cheeks like you used to
Because everything I do, do
I do it for you, you

Baby when I dream of you
Kiss my cheeks like you used to
Because everything I do, do
I do it for you, you

And ever since you went away
I cry so hard, I hope and I pray
That you'll come back to me, to me
Just for one more day

Baby when I dream of you
Kiss my cheeks like you used to
Because everything I do, do
I do it for you, you

Baby when I dream of you
Kiss my cheeks like you used to
Because everything I do, do
I do it for you, you

Baby when I dream of you
Kiss my cheeks like you used to
Because everything I do, do
I do it for you, you

I will see you beneath the falls
二人がもう一度契る場所
