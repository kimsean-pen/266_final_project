History repeats itself
Over and over, again and again
Why should we escape ourselves
We are who we are in the end
In the end

Over & over again
Over & over again

This is madness, madness
And you know that
This is madness, madness
And you know that
This is never-changing, it's always been this way
Consuming madness, madness

Enemies who once were friends
Round and around till we know how it ends
I can't believe how sickening
All the love lost we can't even pretend

Over & over again
Over & over again

This is madness, madness
And you know that
This is madness, madness
And you know that
This is never-changing, it's always been this way
Consuming madness, madness

This is madness, madness
And you know that
This is madness, madness
And you know that
This is never-changing, it's always been this way
Consuming madness, madness
