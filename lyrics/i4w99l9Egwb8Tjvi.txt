I almost fell in love with you
After the club last night
It don't know what you do
Money's gonna treat you right

(Pre-chorus)
Girl, don't act like you changed
When we both know you can't
And I know you love me
Cause i think you're lovely

Girl check my coat
Drop that as in the floor
See you move on that pole
Baby, look at you go
Girl, check my coat
Drop that ass on the floor
See you move on that pole
Baby, look at you go

I almost fell in love with you
After the club last night
And you told me 'don't spend too much'
Girl, take your own advice

(Pre-Chorus)
Girl, don't act like you changed
When we both know you can't
And I know you love me
Cause i think you're lovely

Girl check my coat
Drop that as in the floor
See you move on that pole
Baby, look at you go
Girl, check my coat
Drop that ass on the floor
See you move on that pole
Baby, look at you go
