May you always, may you always walk in hope
And may your days just be a way
To walk upon a great high road
When the dark comes, when the dark comes to your door
You deny him, don't recognize him
He's not welcome anymore
In your life, in your life, in your life
In the forest, in the forest when you hear
Something that scares you
Be aware that it is frightened of you too
You can push that knot away, you can push that knot away
Yes, you can push that knot away, you can push that knot away, yeah
You can push that knot away, you can push that knot away, yeah
And in the morning, in the morning when you wake
It is a doorway for you to walk
Through to become what you make
And just remember you have heaven in your heart
It is inside you and it will guide you so long as you listen hard
In your life, in your life, in your life
Daisy, you know this, you know this already
Daisy, you know this, you know this already
Daisy, you know this, you know this already
Daisy, you know this, you know this already
Ohh, oh, you can push that knot away
You can push that knot away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you can push that knot away
You can push that knot away, uh ah
Well, you can push that knot away, you can push that knot away
(Daisy, you know this, you know this already)
You can push that knot away, you can push that knot away
(Daisy, you know this, you know this already)
You won't regret it, I'm betting you'll push that knot away
(Daisy, you know this, you know this already)
You won't regret it, I'm betting you'll push that knot away
(Daisy, you know this, you know this already)
Yes, you can push that knot away, you can push that knot away
