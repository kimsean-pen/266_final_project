In your fitted raincoat and tangled winter hair
Cheeks a little rosy in the February air
And running through the subway to catch the Uptown train
Spend the night just dancing
Running through the subway to catch the Uptown train
I spent the night just dancing

I want you, yeah, I want you
I want you, yeah, I want you bad
So bad I can't think straight
So bad all my bones shake
So bad I can't breathe

Then in the midnight choir, outside the Whirlaway
We could have just one more and maybe you could stay
And in the light of morning for 21 days straight
There you are beside me
And in the light of morning for 21 days straight
There you are beside me

I want you, yeah, I want you
I want you, yeah, I want you bad
So bad I can't think straight
So bad all my bones shake
So bad I can't breathe

So won't cha, oh won't cha say it?
So won't cha, oh give in?
So won't cha, oh won't cha come on?

I can't breathe!

'Cause I want you, yeah, I want you
I want you, yeah, I want you bad
So bad I can't think straight
So bad all my bones shake
So bad I can't breathe

I want you, yeah, I want you, so bad I can't breathe
I can't breathe
