I'm an invincible force of evil
My eternal hatred is destructive
There's no chance to survive
I incarnate the end of mankind

I'm in quest of human flesh
Following your track of blood
Don't try to escape or resist
Christ won't help you tonight

Invincible force!
Invincible force!

You break down in the morass
Turn and see my bloodstained claws
I tear hot shreds of your face
Now you curse the day of birth

You agonize in a pool of blood
Screaming out and begging for mercy
Possessed by satanic lust for flesh
I smash your head with maniac power

Invincible force!
Invincible force!
