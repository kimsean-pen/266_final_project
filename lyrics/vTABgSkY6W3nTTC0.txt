These quiet words, they carry me away
Returning, they keep coming back
In idle thoughts and hollow cut-away
Disarm me, no will to attack

Though the sorrow and fear
They may depart you today
I will fail you, Of that I'm sure
I will remind you of the pain forevermore
And when my sins are just a memory
Faith restored
I will fail you to the core

Lost in the shadow of an endless grace
Relentless, my reign is unbound
In this abandon I will devastate
Dismember till agony's found

Though the sorrow and fear
They may depart you today
I will fail you, Of that I'm sure
I will remind you of the pain forevermore
And when my sins are just a memory
Faith restored
I will fail you to the core

I know they prey upon me
I feel them just beyond my door

I will fail you, Of that I'm sure
I will remind you of the pain forevermore
And when my sins are just a memory
Faith restored
I will fail you to the core
I will fail you, Of that I'm sure
I will remind you of the pain forevermore
And when my sins are just a memory
Faith restored
I will fail you to the core
