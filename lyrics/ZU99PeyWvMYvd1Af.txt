I'm back
Back in town
And everything has changed
I feel
Feel let down
The faces stay the same
I see
See shadows

Of who we used to be
When I drive
Drive so slow through this memory
When we were only kids

And we were best of friends
And we hopped for the best
And let go of the rest
I heard
Heard myself
Say things I'd that back
If could
Could retell

And make this stories last
I see
See shadows of who we'll always be
When I'm blind drive these rodes
That made our memories
When we were only kids

And we were best of friends
And we hopped for the best
And let go of the rest
The shadows and regrets

We'll let go of the rest
Everything has changed
The faces stayed the same
Everything has changes
The faces stayed the same
When we were only kids
And our time couldn't end
And how tall did we stand
With world in our hands
And we were only kids
And we were best of friends
And we hopped for the best
And let go of the rest
The shadows and regrets
We'll let go of the rest
The shadows and regrets
We'll let go of the rest
