There are boys
Like fading coals, lost souls
Switch blades in tribal ways
There's good and evil in their eyes

Lost Boys
I love those Lost Boys
Lost Boys
Where are those Lost Boys?

They're so lost in love
They're so lost in love

There are boys in the twilight zone, alone
Saints with sins and heroines
There's good and evil in their eyes

Lost Boys
I love those Lost Boys
Lost Boys
Where are those Lost Boys?

They're so lost in love
They're so lost in love
