I wish you could see inside my heart,
Walk right throught it and cover all the scars
Tell me, can you find love in that shadowed void
Or is it just an empty shell falling into ruin

I will hide it all
When you hold me close to your heart
No love can save me now

All I want is to live one day
Like a lion, so free and brave
I can fight, I can roar, I can cry
But I can't feel your love in my Lionheart.
No no no!

I can't deny the truth I know
To whom my final breath belongs
The only fire in me you'll ever find
Is the funeral pyre of love burning high

I can take no more
Will I die alone tonight
And fly toward the stars?

All I want is to live one day
Like a lion, so free and brave
I can fight, I can roar, I can cry
But I can't feel your love in my Lionheart.

All I want is to fly away
From this night of eternal rain
I can fight, I can roar, I can cry
But I can't feel your love in my Lionheart.

(Solo)

All I want is to live one day
Like a lion, so free and brave
I can fight, I can roar, I can cry
But I can't feel your love in my Lionheart.

All I want is to fly away
From this night of eternal rain
I can fight, I can roar, I can cry
But I can't feel your love in my Lionheart.

Lionheart
