'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing

Go down, go down, go down, go downtown
Go down, go down, go down, go down

Your face never saw the sites, the bright lights
The walls that always invite
Get it right, no fight
You'll be there up all night

I'll give you a bus ride, a park slide
A high rise full of surprises
A smooth path, follow track
All the way to my flat

Come with me, come with me
Come with me, come with me there

'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you downtown

Went to your area and I thought I would bury ya
Touched a monolith and it caused a hysteria
You keep on pinin' for me to go dinin'
I had me a meal and that keep me belly from whinin'

Come with me, come with me
Come with me, come with me there

'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you downtown

Go down, go down, go down, go downtown
Go down, go down, go down, go downtown
Go down, go down, go down, go downtown
Go down, go down, go down, go downtown

Caves for bravin', go down
Flags for wavin', go down
Clubs for ravin', go down
Roads for pavin', downtown

Rivers for sailin', go down
Stores unveilin', go down
Walls for scalin', go down
Temples for wailin'

'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing

'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you downtown
