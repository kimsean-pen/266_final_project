Ask me how I'm doin'
I smile and say I'm fine
There ain't no need to ask me brotha
What I've been doin' to pass the time

I lay awake at night still fallin' under your spell (Let her go)
What was a home is again my lonely prison cell (She don't know)

Try to get by just for a while
To hide my pride paint on my smile

Too late to say I'm sorry
With a guilt that I can't stand
Upon your chest your arms are folded
With a bottle in your hand

The devil makes his mark, the needle takes its toll (Let her go)
I told you that I'd forgive, but that won't save your soul (She don't know)

Try to get by just for a while
To hide my pride paint on my smile
Yeah, try to get by just for a while
To hide my pride paint on my smile

All these people think I'm crazy
I smile and say I'm fine
I saw the cruelness of addiction
I saw you fade away with time

Try to get by just for a while
To hide my pride paint on smile
Try to get by just for a while
To hide my pride paint on my smile
Try to get by just for a while
To hide my pride paint on my smile
(Can't you see yeah)
(No, oh...)
