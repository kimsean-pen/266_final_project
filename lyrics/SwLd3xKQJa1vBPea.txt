'Cause some things just don't change, it's better when they stay the same
I'll throw the whole world knows your name, so on the biggest stage
they came to see you spit your game, oh oooh
But it shouldn't be difficult

to explain just why you came back again
You hate the fame, love the game
Cold as ice he remain, Fuck em all
Tell em all eat shit
Here we go again...

Oh, God Damn
Is it that time again already?
Ok
Ya'll don't look too happy to see me

Fuck man
Don't everybody welcome me back at once
Aight, then fuck it already

You can get the dick
Just call me the ball sack
I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch dawg
Fall back, ya mutts

Fuck your worms
You never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it a sick duck
I want my duck sicked mummy

and my nuts licked
gobble em up trick yummy
Bitch, you don't fucking think
that I know that you suck dick dummy

You get your butt kicked
Fuck all that love sick honey

Yeah, I laugh when I call you a slut
It's funny
Shortly dance while I dis
you to the beat
Fuck the words
You don't listen to em anyway

Yeah, struck a nerve sucker
Motherfucker might as well let
my lips pucker, like Elton John

'Cause I'm just a mean cock sucker
This shit is on
cuz you went and pissed me off
Now I'm sitting and pissing on
everybody

Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So fuck the Buddha
Light a bong
Well take a look at Mariah
next time I inspire

you to write a song, c'mon

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows

When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man I just don't know no no no no no no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Bl- bl- blows, Bl- blow blows oh oh

Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon

Bruce Banners back in the booth
Ya'll are sitting ducks
I'm the only goose standing

I'll set the world on fire
piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle
But I'm not fucking around
motherfucker
I saw you pussy footin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt
Till it makes her queef

and sounds like a fucking
whoopie cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin'?
You must have mistook me for
some sissy soft punk
looking for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead, fucking hater, push me
I told you
ain't no fucking way to shush me
Call me a faggot
Cuz I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up, sissy G's up
All you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down
Shady ease up, Man chill
Nah, I can't god damnit

Rap is a land fill
Drop the anvil
These are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens
the world will stop spinning
and Michael J Fox
will come to a stand still
During a earthquake
urine in your face
cuz your fake
Aahh, what the fuck, that hurt wait
Aahh, what the fuck
I just got struck by lightning
I write, then I quit
God, I give up
Call it evil that men do
Lord forgive me for what my pen do

[This is for your sins, I cleanse you
and you can repent but I warn you,
if you continue, to hell I send you]

And just then the wind blew
and I said...

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man I just don't know no no no no no no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Bl- bl- blows, Bl- blow blows oh oh o-

How long will I be this way?
Shady, until my dying day
Until I hang up the mic
and it's time for me to say
so long till then I drop the
fucking bombs like I missed
the pass when I went long
If you don't like it
you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along
Slut this, slut that
learn the words to the song
Oh, bitches don't like that
Homie, I'll be nicer to women
when Aquaman drowns and
The Human Torch starts swimming
Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo
so don't compare me to
them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges
Peaches to plums
Yeah, I'm bananas
Pussy cut off the grapes
and grow a pair, but I swear
you try to dis me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything
Like everyone does
We're auto-tuned
The last thing you want to do
is have me spit out a rhyme
and say I was writing
this and I thought of you so

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man I just don't know no no no no no no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Bl- bl- blows, Bl- blow blows oh oh o-

I don't know
I don't know what caused
I don't know
What caused me to be this way
I don't know, I don't know
But I'll probably
be this way until my dying day
I don't know why I'm so
I'm so cold
Mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me
