Forgive me now for I have sold my soul for gold
Washed up on shore a thouhsand miles away from home
Just as I began to settle into these skin and bones alone
I find the answers to questions I have never known

Is there life beyond the grave
And will I make the same mistakes day after day
There must be a better way

Running from time to try to keep myself alive
Release my pride to keep from pushing the light aside
Now as I began to let this in I must keep the best in mind
And remove myself from the things that are wasing my time

I know that one of these days I'll finally see you
Face to face at the golden gates
Will you take me or will I fade into the grave
I know these words won't hold any weight
But please don't turn away
Don't turn away from me

Is there life beyond the grave
And will I make the same mistakes day after day
There must be a better way
I know that one of these days I'll finally see you
Face to face at the golden gates
Will you take me or will I fade into the grave

Is there life beyond the grave
And will I make the same mistakes day after day
There must be a better way
I know that one of these days I'll finally see you
Face to face at the golden gates
Will you take me or will I fade into the grave

Forgive me now for I have sold my soul for gold
Washed up on shore a thouhsand miles away from home
Just as I began to settle into these skin and bones alone
I find the answers to questions I have never known
