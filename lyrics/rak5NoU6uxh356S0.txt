Last night I burned a polaroid of you
Not because I want you dead
But because I really love you
How you got inside my head
I don't know I'll never learn
Now I'm breathing in the fumes of your photo while it burns

Last night I burned a polaroid of you
Not because I want you dead
But because I really love you
How you got inside my head
I don't know I'll never learn
Now I'm breathing in the fumes of your photo while it burns

Get me off of this roller coaster
I can feel better knowing that it's almost over
We we're falling out the rails going upside down
Then it stopped at the top and I fell right out
When the breaks hit my old soul jolted forward
And to think I would have come out my corner for her
Now it's all I got to think about, so think about me
When you pour your next drink up out, and maybe sing aloud

Time is on my side
No you ain't hearing nothing from me
Since that day you lied
I learned that highway talking is cheap
A magnet for these guys
Why they always come looking for me?
Got those lips that stain like wine
Sounds just fine, yeah

Last night I burned a polaroid of you
Not because I want you dead
But because I really love you
How you got inside my head
I don't know I'll never learn
Now I'm breathing in the fumes of your photo while it burns

Last night I had a nightmare about you
Not because you were around
But because I was without you
How to get you out my head
I don't know I'll never learn
That the world doesn't care about our feelings when it turns

Get me off of this carousel
If I go 'round any longer I'll be scared as hell
My mind keeps playing tricks saying get back on, sit back
Keep that calm, relax, it's mad fun
It's a good thing I guess that I'm miles away
If I flew private planes, then I would fly out today
And it's all that I can picture now
So pull the pictures out
And hang 'em just to strip 'em down
But keep 'em on the ground

Time is on my side
Every day passed feels like a week
Since that day you lied
And don't say anything I believe
A magnet for this kind
So I'll know I did the right thing
Maybe we'll be fine
But it's really not likely, yeah

I wish I still had my polaroid of you
Not because I want you back
Just because I really love you
You say you want the best for me
And dare I say the same
If I put my last photo of you
Right inside a flame

Last night I burned a polaroid of you
Not because I want you dead
But because I really love you
How you got inside my head
I don't know I'll never learn
Now I'm breathing in the fumes of your photo while it burns

Last night I had a nightmare about you
Not because you were around
But because I was without you
How to get you out my head
I don't know I'll never learn
That the world doesn't care about our feelings when it turns
