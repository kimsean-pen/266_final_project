I want to be a woman of regimen
A bride in her home state
A diving woman of Jeju-do

I want it all
I want it

The men have gone and left again
And no one's shocked or blames them
Another day is shot, my friend
I'm picking up the pieces
That's the third dead dog I've seen on this highway
These treads are wearing thin
When I get back there, baby
I'm gonna make you a home

You'll have it all
I'll have it
