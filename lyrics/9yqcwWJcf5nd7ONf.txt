It started when my baby didn't need me
I punched my fist throught the TV
Put it in my shirt to stop the bleeding
And walked to the train lookin' evil
I hopped the gate, I don't got change for it
I got anger issues, I'mma pay for it
Love's only what you get to take for it
And if you ain't patient, don't wait for it

All my life tryna be somebody
(All my life tryna be somebody)
All my life tryna be somebody

Momma, I don't wanna be famous
I just wanna go home
You know I don't ever feel shame but
I'm ashamed, take me home
I'll do better, I promise
I'll do better, I promise
I'll do better, I promise
Just for you

It started with a cigarette and a whiskey
Escalated when she ain't miss me
I got a good feeling I'm replaced now
Yeah, I'm drinking straight, I don't chase now
Depression got me picking up the pace now
They won't see me take it to the face now
I mix it with the smoke for the balance
Admitting all this my biggest challenge

All my life trynna be somebody
(All my life trynna be somebody)
All my life trynna be somebody

Momma, I don't wanna be famous
I just wanna go home
You know I don't ever feel shame but
I am ashamed, take me home
I'll do better I promise
I'll do better I promise
I'll do better I promise
Just for you

Momma, I don't wanna be famous
You know I don't ever feel shame but
I am ashamed, take me home
I'll do better, I promise
I'll do better, I promise
I'll do better, I promise
Just for you
