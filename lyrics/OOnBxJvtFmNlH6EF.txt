Do you feel like i do
tired of everything?
can you feel what i can
almost everything?
I wanna leave today
the sky is big and my life is small
i wanna leave with you
so we can build a perfect garden
The stars are far away
i can see them with my eyes
i watch then burn away
like the moments of my life
I wanna leave today
the sky is big and my life is small
i wanna leave with you
so we can build a desert garden
Mmmm...
mmmm...
The stars are far away
i can see them with my eyes
i watch them fade away
like the moments of my life
Strange how the houses look
exactly all the same
and you're just a slave like me
at least i know it's true
I wanna leave today
the sky is big and my life is small
i wanna leave with you
so we can build a desert garden
The stars are far away
i can see them in my eyes
we watch them fade away
like the moments of my life
