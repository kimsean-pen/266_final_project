Excuse the stench of my own
Pitiful excuse for a mood
It's second nature to be critical
Affection removed

Well I guess I could wait
For a chance to escape
But you're so sideways
Playing mind games

Consider this a lasting funeral
The flowers for you
Surround yourself with something beautiful
And they will approve

Well I guess I can wait
For a chance to escape
But you're so sideways
Playing mind games

You're so sideways
Desperate tirades
It's a crime
You're in your prime
