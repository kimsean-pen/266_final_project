lights are out and my eyes are shut
when i stand it hurts too much
no matter what i do you know it's true
when i dream i dream of you
when i don't have you i'm losing my mind
i wish i was with you all of the time
when i don't have you i'm losing my mind
i wish i was with you all of the time
why won't you stay with me
why won't you stay with me
(why won't you stay with me)no matter what i do you know it's true
(why won't you stay with me)when i dream i dream of you
when i don't have you i'm losing my mind
i wish i was with you all of the time
when i don't have you i'm losing my mind
i wish i was with you all of the time
