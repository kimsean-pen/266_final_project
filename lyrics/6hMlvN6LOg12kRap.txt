"Close To Paradise"

We're walking close to Paradise
And more than other days
Yes, I'm walking closer and closer
But not close enough
Yes, I'm walking closer and closer
But not close enough

Waking morning sunshine burns
'Cause you fall from where your felt you are
And you're running faster and faster
Oh, but the days they ain't slowing down
And don't you, don't you wanna be there, there right now

Yes, I'm walking closer and closer
But not close enough
Yes, I'm walking closer and closer
To Paradise
We'll promise that
To Paradise
We'll promise that

Hey lovely people down there
Let's fill that hole up in the sky
Don't be afraid to care
I'm sure you'll find yourself there
Hey lovely people down there
Let's fill that hole up in the sky
Don't be afraid to care
I'm sure you'll find yourself there

I'm sure you'll find yourself there
When you're down, hold on
I'm sure you'll find yourself there
When you're down, hold on
I'm sure you'll find yourself there

Close, close to Paradise
