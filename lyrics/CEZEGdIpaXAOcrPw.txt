Extraordinarily pretty teeth
Beauty lingers out of reach
You're my DC oh Lee, oh
Man Ray went cray cray over you
Capturing but never captured
You're my DC oh Lee, oh

Swim low
In the back, dry in the night

Put it there, get the money (watch me now)
In the back of a Volvo car

Anna Bolina
Maid of honour
Not your sister, fearful temper
You're my DC oh Anna, oh
Unknown artist
Took your likeness
Henry Tudor left you lifeless
You're my DC oh Anna, oh

Keepa, keepa, keepa, keep me damn down
Let it low
Let me know where you go (watch me now)
Papa, papa, papa
Get me down
Deep, deep down
Pablo, let me know

If you don't have the ace of hearts
My dear, you're a lost man
Falcon for you, Anna, from the left arm of the falconer
Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna L'Arl√©sienne
