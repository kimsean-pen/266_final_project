Some people say such awful things
Don't understand they're so hateful
We don't need those diamond rings
Even though they look tasteful
Chichi parties
So important
Sink a fortune
High-class apartment
One or two ooh-oohs
Make you feel so good
It's not a threat to nobody
In fact the people they should

Oooh
Don't you give me them blues
I got magic in my dancing shoes
Let me hear you say ooooh

Oooh
Don't you give me them blues
I got magic in my dancing shoes
Let me hear you say ooooh

When you talk sweet things in my ear
I get so hot inside I'm burning my clothes
Measure distances with tears
The tracks'll run for miles when I feel those
Mixed emotions
In your heart
Guilty feelings
You fall apart
One or two ooooh's
Nothing left to lose
I'm not a threat to nobody
Don't try to give me them blues

Oooh
Don't you give me them blues
I got magic in my dancing shoes
Let me hear you say ooooh

Oooh
Don't you give me them blues
I got magic in my dancing shoes
Let me hear you say ooooh

Say honey baby don't you know
Ain't got any money left to blow
Can't buy you no snow cone
Even when it's hot outside

Wanna make love show you what I can do
Pocket that rug you'll ride the groove
Just lemme go dance and give me no blues tonight

Oooh
Don't you give me them blues
I got magic in my dancing shoes
Let me hear you say ooooh

Oooh
Don't you give me them blues
I got magic in my dancing shoes
Let me hear you say ooooh

Oooh
Don't you give me them blues
I got magic in my dancing shoes
Let me hear you say ooooh

Oooh
Don't you give me them blues
I got magic in my dancing shoes
Let me hear you say ooooh
(I got magic in my dancing shoes)
