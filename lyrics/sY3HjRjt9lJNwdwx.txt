It's been a while since I was here
Ten years ago I think
Wanna go before I fear
Always stop before the brink

I'm going back before I break
Going back before it's too late
I'm going back to strange

I'm so close to the line
I can see the house from here
Got some crazy on my mind
Oh, my heart belongs here

I'm going back before I break
Going back before it's too late
I'm going back to strange
I'm going back to strange
I'm going back to strange
I'm going back to strange
I'm going back to strange
