You make me so upset some times
I feel like I could lose my mind
The conversation goes nowhere
Cause you're never gonna take me there

And I know what I know
And I know you're not good for me
Yeah I know what I know
And I know it's not meant to be

He's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My, my, my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you outta my head
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to
My dilemma, my dilemma
It's you, it's you

Your eyes have told a thousand lies
But I believe them when you look in mine
I heard the rumours but you won't come clean
I guess I'm hoping it's because of me

And I know what I know
And I know you're not good for me
Yeah I know what I know
And I know it's not meant to be

He's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My, my, my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you outta my head
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to
My dilemma, my dilemma
It's you, it's you

I can't live without ya
Your smile, your eyes
The way you make me feel inside
I can't live without ya

But I don't wanna I don't wanna
And the other half wants to forget
My, my, my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you outta my head
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to
My dilemma, my dilemma
It's you, it's you
