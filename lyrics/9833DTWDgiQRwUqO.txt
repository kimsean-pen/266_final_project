And when you try
You'll catch my vibe
I'll blast a million moons away
I'll blow a million miles a day

God bless you, child
You put me up and down inside
I'll blast a million moons away
I'll blow a million miles a day

Five, four, three, two, one
Blast off

You pretty little dog, you're so pretty
In your own special way
The way you make me move
The way you make me groove
The way you make me dance

I want it right here
I want it right here

Five, four, three, two, one
Blast off

Rocketeer
You got a lot of learning to do
Soon you'll find yourself

Take off your mask, Rocketeer
I want to see who I'm dealing with here
