If you want to see and be seen, then be seen
Your dress is dark red
And your opening eyes are bright green, make a scene
But don't lie on the bed, laid out like you're dead
Because honey, you're murdering me

Be a little sheep learning who'll shear and who'll feed
The hands come and they leave
Be hands holding a knife. Be a being on two feet
With his heart trembling
Butchering for a king he believes in though he's never seen
Ladadada

Be the princess in that stone tower
Crying for that handsome butcher's plight
And, as some princess might
She still calls him a knight

But the best thing for you would be queen, so be queen
You're all that I need.
Though I know that it never can be, I'd be pleased
To post your decrees, to fall at your knees
To name all your streets and to sit down and weep
When you're carried back through them and set down to sleep
And to lie by your side for sublime centuries
Til we crumble to dust
When we're crushed by a single sunbeam
