Treasonous
Unable to uphold an oath that they swore to us
Traitors
Selling us down the river to the big business
Greed
They get richer while their policies ruin the lives of millions
Criminal
I think it's time for justice to be served

The enemy is not coming from overseas
The enemy is not coming from overseas
The enemy is not coming from overseas

Hang 'em high
Hang 'em high

Liars
They promise the world and never follow through
Betrayers
Turning their backs on the people that gave them power
Disgrace
Is what they bring to the idea of democracy
Punishment
I think it's time they get what they deserve

The enemy is not coming from overseas
The enemy is not coming from overseas
The enemy is not coming from overseas

Hang 'em high
Hang 'em high

Selling out
To the highest bidder
So spineless
So low
Politicians and big business
The united snakes of America

Criminal
I think it's time for justice to be served
Punishment
I think it's time they get what they deserve

The enemy is not coming from overseas
The enemy is not coming from overseas
The enemy is not coming from overseas
The enemy is not coming from overseas
The enemy is not coming from overseas
The enemy is not coming from overseas
The enemy is not coming from overseas

Hang 'em high
