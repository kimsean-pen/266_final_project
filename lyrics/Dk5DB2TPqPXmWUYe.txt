You want a piece of me? You'll make it
You want to hit me, then you're satisfied
I'm gonna fall, I'm gonna fake it
Now I will make you think you've won again

I've fallen down, my nose bleeding badly
I'm where you want me

But

Shut your face, shut your, shut, shut, shut your face up
When doors are locked, I'm gonna get you
You are not safe any place, anywhere
I'm bringing Bundys, have they met you?

I'm telling stories, saying what you're gonna do
I've fallen down, my nose bleeding badly
I'm where you want me
I know the words I know when to say them

You're where I want you
I'm coming to get you
Yeah, I'm coming to get you
I have a surprise for you
Beware, beware

Don't go to bed, don't close your eyes
I've fallen down, my nose bleeding badly
I'm where you want me
I know the words I know when to say them
You're where I want you
I know the words I know when to say them
You're where I want you
Shut your face, shut your, shut, shut, shut your face up
