There's a light in the distance I can see it
Shining bright if I listen I can hear it

But it feels just like my heart ought's breaking in two (ooh ooh ooh)
Ooh, what can I do?
I'm just trying to keep it together
Waiting for you

Tell you this "I don't need anything!"
Say for that one last kiss
So, baby come to me
Oh, baby come to me
Time with you
When it was gone too soon
Oh, what I wanna do
So, baby come to me
For that one last kiss

Late at night hold my breath and
I could feel it
All your touch and your whispers
How I need it

But it feels just like my heart ought's breaking in two (ooh ooh ooh)
Ooh, what can I do?
I'm just trying to keep it together
Waiting for you

Tell you this "I don't need anything!"
Say for that one last kiss
So, baby come to me
Oh, baby come to me
Time with you
When it was gone too soon
Oh, what I wanna do
So, baby come to me
For that one last kiss

Kiss kiss kiss
Just give me one more
Kiss kiss kiss

Baby, tell you this "I don't need anything!"
Say for that one last kiss
So, baby come to me
Oh, baby come to me
Time with you
When it was gone too soon
Oh, what I wanna do
So, baby come to me
For that one last kiss

Kiss kiss kiss
Come to me, come to me
Kiss kiss kiss
For that one last
Oh, come to me, come to me
Kiss kiss kiss
For that one last kiss
