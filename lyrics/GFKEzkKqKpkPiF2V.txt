If you leave me
Leave me guessing darling
Then I guess you're not for me
When you're talking
Talking with an old friend
And you decide you must be free

Tell me why, why woman
Can we leave a good thing be?
Tell me why, why woman
Did you give up so easily?

When you're looking
Looking for some heat now
And I'm as cold as cold can be
And you're talking
Talking about a change now
But those changes aren't with me

Tell me why, why woman
Can we just leave a good thing be?
Tell me why, why woman
Can we just be happy?

Better leave it alone
Let it work out by itself
My friends keep telling me, no
Why she's not with nobody else
Oh but I don't know

Tell me why, why woman
Can we just leave a good thing be?
Tell me why, why woman
Just stick around and work it out with me
