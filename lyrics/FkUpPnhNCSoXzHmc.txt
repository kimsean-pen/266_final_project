Someday, in this dark place one will step into the light
And expose you for what you really are

Why am I the one who just keeps on running?
Why am I surrounded by shadows of my doubt?
I search for some sort of solace
But I am a man with no light to guide me out

Why must I run, why must I hide?
I'd rather be living in hell than never have lived with nothing to tell

So when you end up on your own with just your pillow to hold tight
Please know there's no reason to be afraid
Cause if they black out the sun and your blood turns to dust
I'll follow you into your grave

A menace, a monster, the thing that haunts your dreams
A nightmare, my comfort
I'll thrive on all your tears
I don't know what you take me for

Why must I run, why must I hide?
I'd rather be living in hell than never have lived alone

So when you end up on your own with just your pillow to hold tight
Please know there's no reason to be afraid
Cause if they black out the sun and your blood turns to dust
I'll follow you into your grave

So when you're shattered and you're broke with out someone to hold on to
Just know I'll always be there close behind
And if you're able to love when all's said and done
Then I swear we'll all be fine

This won't be my last breath
You can't take my life away
You're just a worthless
Good for nothing fuck, good for nothing fuck

Why must I run, why must I hide?
I'd rather be living in hell than never have lived alone

So when you end up on your own with just your pillow to hold tight
Please know there's no reason to be afraid
Cause if they black out the sun and your blood turns to dust
I'll follow you into your grave

So when you're shattered and you're broke with out someone to hold on to
Just know I'll always be close there behind
And if you're able to love when all's said and done
Then I swear we'll all be fine
