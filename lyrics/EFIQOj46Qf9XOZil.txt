We stand defiant
In this great big ugly world
Do believe that the chaos
Was our one true calling
First we muscled fate
Then we brazenly call disorder
Watch the normals cower
They just can't take it anymore
Withstand together now
All the damning from on high
Fist horns are roaring forth
As I scream into the sky
I'm morbid
Morbid and
Sordid
Distorted
Bring them to their knees
I'm morbid
Morbid
Won't be thwarted
From celebrating morbid victories
We're seen as monsters, merely being...
Is a threat to all
What can't destroy us makes us strong
And in a twisted mind
Oh everything is possible
And in a twist of fate
We make it all come down... Crumbling down
Oh we'll bring them down
We stand invincible not just a dream
Straight from the underground we scream
I'm morbid...
We stand invincible not just a dream
Straight from the underground
The Gods are screaming
Tear down the obstacles this is our way
We're born to quake the world
There is no other way
I'm morbid...
