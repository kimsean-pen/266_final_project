Hold up you're movin' too fast
I'm up for somethin' that lasts
I ain't lookin' to screw on the first night
'Cause that's a no go
And if the vibe's good, go to first base
'Cause the first kiss could be your last taste
I ain't lookin' to screw till the vibe's right

See I'm the only one you know
That can put you on cruise control
Yeah, I'm the only one you'll find
That won't waste all my time
On nothin', nothin', on nothin', nothin'

My will is stronger than most
I will not let you get close
Until I think that you deserve me
'Cause that's a no go
I'm gonna hold out, so in the meantime
Don't expect much from a strong mind
Until I think that you deserve me

See I'm the only one you know
That can put you on cruise control
Yeah, I'm the only one you'll find
That won't waste all my time

I'm holdin' out, I'm gonna wait
Wanna make it past the first date
A little time then we can do
All them nasty things you want to do
Don't get me wrong, just take my hand
And I really hope you understand that
It's easier when every second counts
So we'll just have to wait

It's really no big deal
It's really no big deal

I'd hate to get you in bed
Find out you're empty instead
No need to knock another home run out
'Cause that's a no go
And I hate to be so filthy
If we were not meant to be
No need to knock another home run out

See I'm the only one you know
That can put you on cruise control
Yeah, I'm the only one you'll find
That won't waste all my time
On nothin', nothin', on nothin', nothin'
On nothin', on nothin'
