Well I think it's time to get ready
To realize just what I found
I have lived unaware of what I am
It's all clear to me now

That my heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turning
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah yeah yeah

Well there's something inside that's makin' me crazy
Tryin' to keep it together
'Cause what I'm saying, I have been saving
And now could be forever

My love is alive, my heart's on fire
Soul is like a wheel like a hot wire
My love is alive, my heart's on fire
Soul's like a wheel like a hot wire

My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turning
My love is alive
My love is alive

There's a mirror inside my mind
Reflectin' the light that shines on me
Hold on to the feeling
Let it be, let it grow

My heart is on fire
My love is alive, yeah yeah yeah
My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turning
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah yeah yeah

My love is alive
My love is alive

Soul's like a wheel that's turning
My love is alive

My love is alive, my heart's on fire
Soul is like a wheel like a hot wire
My love is alive, my heart's on fire
Soul's like a wheel like a hot wire

My love is alive, my heart's on fire
Soul is like a wheel like a hot wire
My love is alive, my heart's on fire
Soul's like a wheel like a hot wire

My love is alive, my love
Well my heart is on fire
