Since they've come, I've tried to go it straight,
But I've got no clue how to
Who's gonna make it up just now try to,
Come up with some high-brow move
Kid gloves, and stranger loves you've known,
You sort it out somehow
You used to chime in quietly, you sing,
But you're a moaner now

Think of all the lives we're saving
Think of all the waves we're breaking

Is it too late to live in your heart,
Too late to burn all your civilian clothes
As you break into a million parts,
Too late to learn it yes we're on a boat

Conquerors of the daybreak
Conquerors of the daybreak
This is the world of the theatre
This is the world of the theatre

All the phantom, by the nose they pass, you're on your way to dine
They call you from their hiding places on the shoulders of your chance

Think of all the cold we're braving
Think of all the ways we're caving

Is it too late to live in your heart,
Too late to burn all your civilian clothes
As you break into a million parts,
Too late to learn it yes we're on a boat

Conquerors of the daybreak
Conquerors of the daybreak
This is the world of the theatre
This is the world of the theatre

Is it too late to live in your heart,
Too late to burn all your civilian clothes
As you break into a million parts,
Too late to learn it yes we're on a boat

Conquerors of the daybreak
Conquerors of the daybreak
Conquerors of the daybreak
Conquerors of the daybreak
This is the world of the theatre
This is the world of the theatre
