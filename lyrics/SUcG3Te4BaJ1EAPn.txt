(Verse)
You keep trying to forget about the good times
Does it make you fall a little better?
I'm not alone, I only pick the flowers
Kind of makes you feel a little worthier.
But the chillin turn out fine
I got the pieces if you got the time.

(Chorus)
And I want you, I don't wanna forget
If you go I'll surely get distracted
And I want you, I don't wanna forget
If you go I'll surely get distracted.
I want you, somebody sweet to talk to,
Somebody sweet to talk to.

(Verse)
I don't wanna get stuck in my ways again,
I'm just asking you to stay a couple hours.
I got back to the road where I started
Looking instead of always picking flowers.
Plus the children who turned out fine,
I've got the pieces if you got the time.

(Chorus)
And I want you, I don't wanna forget
If you go I'll surely get distracted
And I want you, I don't wanna forget
If you go I'll surely get distracted.
I want you, somebody sweet to talk to,
Somebody sweet to talk to.

(Chorus)
And I want you, I don't wanna forget
If you go I'll surely get distracted
And I want you, I don't wanna forget
If you go I'll surely get distracted.
I want you, somebody sweet to talk to,
Somebody sweet to talk to.
