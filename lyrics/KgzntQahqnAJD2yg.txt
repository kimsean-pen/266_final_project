Eternal rains will come
(and) We should say goodbye
(to) Suffer on our own
Song that thoughts were home [?]

So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through
When the flood comes to drown us
There's nothing we can do

Told me not to wait
(Un)less I could wait forever
(Be)cause there's no time for us
To comfort in what was

So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through
When the flood comes to drown us
There's nothing we can do

Here it comes
On the cusp
And endlessly
Can't forget

Reaching for the surface, I see you
