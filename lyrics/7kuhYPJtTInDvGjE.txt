You've been twisting, turning in your sleep
Your nerves all cut to ribbon, you can barely eat
You're far from home, far from home
Hearing voices on the underground
The built they up and, boy, they will cut you down
And break your bones, break your bones
We've been turning, turning, turning old
Young blood on the floor and a television glow
We're wasting time, wasting time
You've been drinking quietly tonight
Trying to take the edge off the dark, dark bright
Like every time, like every time
