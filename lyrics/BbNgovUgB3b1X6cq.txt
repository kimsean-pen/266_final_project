Here we are standing ablaze
here it is in front of your face
can you not see beyond the maze
a better place

Let it be known
no fate or coincidence

Look at yourself then do it again
you will see it is not the end
these are the hours of measurement
like heaven send

Let it be known
there is fate in coincidence

Fly the night
to be the sky
how high is alright
to be the sky
Fly
to be the sky
How high
to be the sky
