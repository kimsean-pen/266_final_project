One two three four

And hey there lovely lady bug
You got another thing comin' if you think your loved
You're just another little toy in this game of lust
That boy is cheatin' on you

And hey there small town beauty queen
That sneeky little devil aint comin' clean
And I know that you have just met me
But girl you gotta believe me

That I can't believe
That the girl I saw two months ago
Is right infront of me
You took the chance to take my name
And I couldn't see just what you thought you saw in me
But obviously it's stuck.

And hey there little miss diamond ring
Is he all that he's cracked up to be
I find it so hard to believe
Cuz girl you just can't smile

And I know that I am such a creep
Callin' 24 hours 7 days a week
But I got somethin to say, I got somethin to say, I got somethin to say to you!

That I can't believe
That the girl I had one year ago
Is right infront of me
You took the chance to take my name
And I couldn't see
Just what you thought you saw in me
And obviously it's stuck.
