Don't close the door when you leave
It's cold out
I need to see the air when you breathe
And say out loud
That you'll be home soon
Not to worry
You're gonna hurry back

Has anybody seen my soldier?
Standing all alone
Has anybody seen my soldier?
Just tryna get home

You're not alone when you dream
I'm with you
I hear your heart when it beats
I feel it too
Sleep in peace
Love is tender
Please remember me

Has anybody seen my soldier?
Standing all alone
Has anybody seen my soldier?
Just tryna get home

Where did you go, my love? (I need to know)
I need to know you're safe (so many miles)
So many miles between us
I need to see your face

Has anybody seen my soldier?
Standing all alone
Has anybody seen my soldier?

Oh, has anybody seen my soldier?
Standing all alone
Has anybody seen my soldier?
Just tryna get home

Just tryna get home
