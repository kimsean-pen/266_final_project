You never make it simple
But I'm down for the challenge
I've been caught up in the middle
Tryna find a balance
And I should have seen it coming
When you turn into a savage
But you got something special
All the other girls are average
And I still got my eyes on you
After all this shit you put me through
And I know I never say I do
But I like wasting my time on you

I like, wasting all my time, wasting, wasting all my time
Wasting all my time on you
I like, wasting all my time, wasting, wasting all my time
Wasting all my time on you
(You're a bad bitch, now I gotta have it)

Only have a couple minutes
Drunk two hours by the time we finished
And I know I should have kept my distance
But I didn't, now you got me trippin'
And I still got my eyes on you
After all this shit you put me through
And I know I never say I do
But I like wasting my time on you

I like, wasting all my time, wasting, wasting all my time
Wasting all my time on you
I like, wasting all my time, wasting, wasting all my time
Wasting all my time on you

Yo, I fell in love when we first met
Not a lot of moments I would regret
And I know this shit is bittersweet
We both know this ain't meant to be
'Cause we live two different lives
And I'm always on the other side
The only thing that money couldn't buy
Was just a little more time
But I still got my eyes on you
After all this shit you put me through
And I know I never say I do
But I like wasting my time on you

I like, wasting all my time, wasting, wasting all my time
Wasting all my time on you
I like, wasting all my time, wasting, wasting all my time
Wasting all my time on you
