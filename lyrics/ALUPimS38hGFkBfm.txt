Don't tell me what's in
Tell me how to write
Don't tell me how to win this fight
Isn't your life
It isn't your right
To take the only thing that's mine
It's over your head
Don't try to read between the lines
Are clearly defined
Never lose sight of something you believe in

Takin' in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window
I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog

I've been trying
To justify you
In the end
I will just defy you

To those who understand
I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand
Take me as I am

Not under your command
I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan
Take me as I am

Still running up hill
Swimming against the current
I wish I weren't so fucked
Feels like I'm stuck
Lost in a sea of mediocrity
"Slow down, you're thinking too much
Where is your soul?"
You can not touch the way I play
Or tell me what to say
You're in the way
Of all that I believe in

Takin' in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window
I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog

I've been wasting my breath on you
Open minds will descend upon you

To those who understand
I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand
Take me as I am

Not under your command
I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan
Take me as I am

To those who understand
I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand
Take me as I am

Not under your command
I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan
Take me as I am
