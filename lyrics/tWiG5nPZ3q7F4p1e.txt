In my heart I see your beauty
In my mind I see your soul
In my eyes I see your body, baby

Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll

In my bones I feel your rhythm
In my veins
Your pulse? flow
In my dreas
I feel your fire, baby

Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll

You make me want to go
When you take me on a high
Then lay me down below
Just to see a lover cry

You turn me all around
'Til my head is in a swoon
You hurl me to the ground
Then present me with the moon

You break my heart in two
Tell me you'll be true

You make me feel so good
When you like to see me sad
Feeling misunderstood
And all the time you say I'm bad

You spin me on my head
And you roll me on my bed
You make me play dead then you toss me in the sack

You tell me you'll be true
Break my heart in two
You make me

Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll

Rock and roll (shake it shake it shake it shake it)
Rock and roll (get on up)
Rock and roll (shake it shake it shake it shake it)
Rock and roll
