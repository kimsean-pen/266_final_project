This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I met you

And then it happened
It took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
I could see it by the look in your eyes

Sweeter than wine
Softer than a summer's night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever 'til the end of time

So why won't you dance with me? Hey baby
Why won't you dance with me?

This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I met you

And then it happened
You know, it took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes

Sweeter than wine
Ooh, softer than a summer's night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight
This magic moment
Sweeter than wine
Softer than a summer's night
So please, baby
So please, save the last dance for me
