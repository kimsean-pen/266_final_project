Had a dream in a rose garden, I
Saw your face in the clouds
Looking 'round to the moonlight rising
And the sun setting down

So you should get some rest
So you should get some rest, tell me

Float away like a drifting ocean
Like you took all the waves
Every day in my mind you're running
And you're keeping the pace

I want to know you best
I want to know you best, tell me

Where you go inside your dreams
What you say when you don't speak, I
Want to know every little thing
About you, about you
Where you go when you're lonely
What you say deep in your sleep, I
Want to know every little thing
About you, about you

And you know I could spend forever
Getting lost in your maze
Like I already know the way out
But I just want to stay

Oh, it's inside my head
Oh, it's inside my head, tell me

Where you go inside your dreams
What you say when you don't speak, I
Want to know every little thing
About you, about you
Where you go when you're lonely
Do you run when love cuts deep? I
Want to know every little thing
About you, about you

Tell me, where you go inside your dreams
What you say when you don't speak, I
Want to know every little thing
About you, about you
Where you go when you're lonely
Is your heart still in one piece? I
Want to know every little thing
About you, about you
