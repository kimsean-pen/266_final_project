Mightiest self!
Cast out of thy Elysium
With blood of Nazarene
I write the history of man
2000 years is nothing
Though it has been enough
Come forth victorious
Muting the foul angelic choirs!

None of thy empty gods shall ever stand above me
None of thy weak brothers shalt ever share my blood
My awareness, catalyst, of godhate I have spawned
In sinister ecstasy, eternally I decompose

Race of man!
The errors of a wise man make thy rules
Ye shall see
Rather than the perfection of the fool
The most divine!
I am many among so very few
Beyond redemption, beyond the weak
Thus I beheld the truth!

None of thy empty gods shall ever stand above me
None of thy weak brothers shalt ever share my blood
My awareness, catalyst, of godhate I have spawned
In sinister ecstasy, eternally I'm decomposed

I am the pure flame that burns
I am (ever shining) Sirius son
I am the infinite space
I am the most conquering One
