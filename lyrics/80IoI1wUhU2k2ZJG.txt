Giant water crystal mouth
That sits like a hat above your silhouette
Can't steal myself from the fountain
That is filling out your beauty

Oh yes, you got me all wet
Your long spider leg lashes are tickling
Your black pretty eyes are glistening
When your ripe strawberry lips part
I can't help, but listen to the sound
Of your power, you're the sun I'm just a flower

Legs still grab, arms are wrapped
They're pulling to the sky
They're falling to your lap
I'd like to see them hold me in a trap
The most gorgeous web I know I gotta stare

Tempting it is to use all my strength
But I know the proper way to play
You want me to show that I can wait it out
Before you eat me up and spit me out

Find love in my blood and use me for your eggs
Just as long as you wrap me up with your arms and legs
Use me for your eggs

Ain't trying to get away
I love your strong chin honey pop, indeed
Help me fall into the darkest lots of sleep
(Wrapped and spun in your web)
Cause I am vulnerable, ooh

You've got me into bed
Tempting it is to use all my strength
But I know the proper way to play
You want me to show that I can wait it out
Before you eat me up and spit me out

Find love in my blood and use me for your eggs
Just as long as you wrap me up with your arms and legs
Use me for your eggs
Cause I ain't trying, I'm trying to get away
Use me for your eggs
Oh use me for your eggs
