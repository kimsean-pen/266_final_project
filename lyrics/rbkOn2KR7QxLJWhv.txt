Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh

I've been afraid
Been alone, been undone
I've been on fire
Flying high as the sun

In a world were things come and go
The only thing I've ever known is true
Oh is you

I've been the prince
I've been the pauper
Been the star and played the fool
Been the winner and the loser
In between them, too
But no matter who I might become
Or who I've been before
I will always be
I will always be yours

Oooh oooh
(Always be yours)
Oooh oooh

I'd run through flames
Push back fate, break down walls
I'd give my heart
Give my breath, give it all

In a world were things come and go
The only thing I can't afford to lose
Oh is you

I've been the prince
I've been the pauper
Been the star and played the fool
Been the winner and the loser
In between them, too
But no matter who I might become
Or who I've been before
I will always be
I will always be yours

Oooh oooh
(I'm gonna be yours, yeah)
Oooh oooh
(I will always be yours)
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh

In a world were things come and go
The only thing I've ever known is true
Oh is you

I've been the prince
I've been the pauper
Been the star and played the fool
Been the winner and the loser
In between them, too
But no matter who I might become
Or who I've been before
I will always be
I will always be yours

Oooh oooh
(I will always be yours)
Oooh oooh
(I will always be yours)
Oooh oooh
(Always be yours)
Oooh oooh
(I will always be yours)
