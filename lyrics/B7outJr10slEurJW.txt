What do you want? I wanna know
You messed me up when you let me go
Now you come back 'cause your ego is stroked
From the way that I cracked after you let me go

I look to things that we could be
Perhaps you would have cheated on me
At least I wouldn't have you haunting me
Now you're haunting me, babe

What do you want? I wanna know
I brought a dandelion you could blow
While you stay mourning for something creative
But memories baited from your loneliness, I see

I look to things that we could be
Perhaps you would have cheated on me
At least I wouldn't have you haunting me
Now you're haunting me, babe

It's like I wanna know I'm someone
It's like I wanna know I'm some
Someone you have to keep, I'm on my knees
Turn the lights out on me, the lights out on me
I'm blacked out

I see again, you make me wait
You make me wait dangling on a string
Begging for you to come back to the ring
'Til I'm salivating for attention that you want me

I look to things that we could be
Perhaps you would have cheated on me
At least I wouldn't have you haunting me
Now you're haunting me, babe

You won't come back, you're not coming
I waited up to say your name
You won't come back, you're not coming
I waited up for you to say my name
You won't come back, you're not coming
I waited up to say your name
You won't come back, you're not coming
I waited up for you to say my name

It's like I wanna know I'm someone
It's like I wanna know I'm some
Someone you have to keep, I'm on my knees
Turn the lights out on me, the lights out on me
I'm blacked out
