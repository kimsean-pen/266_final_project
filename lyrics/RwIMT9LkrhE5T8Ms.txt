I put you up, I treat you well
Tell you secrets I never tell
We pretend, it's all ok
But there's one thing we never say
The world is full of good intentions
Paradise is hard to find
Say they love you but fail to mention
Who they were with again last night

Revenge, regret - I wrote the book
Forgive, forget - I wrote the book
Keeping secrets - I wrote the book on it
Don't test me

Heartbreak and then some, tell me where is a friend when you need one
Before you take a second look, remember I know every trick in the book

It never stops around the clock
When I'm there, you speak so soft
The runaround will wear you out
You break it off, I'll break you down
The world is full of good intentions
Paradise is full of lies
Tell you they love you but fail to mention
Who they were with again last night

Cheating, sneaking - I wrote the book
Begging, pleading - I wrote the book
Lying, crying - I wrote the book on it
Don't test me

Heartbreak and then some, tell me where is a friend when you need one
Before you take a second look, remember I know every trick in the book
Heartbreak and then some, tell me where is a friend when you need one
Before you take a second look, remember I know every trick in the book

I wrote the book
I wrote the book
I wrote the book on it
Don't test me
I wrote the book on it
Don't test me now
I wrote the book on it
