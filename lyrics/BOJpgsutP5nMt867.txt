Luminous deity
Perilous djinn
Sacrificed unity
Servants of sin

Ominous spiritus
Reaper of souls
Living in all of us
Seizing control

What if it's too late to suffer?
What if it's too late to die?

As we rise
Seeking shelter from our sins
We'll escape
From the universe within
In a time
When the veil is growing thin
We'll take flight
From the universe within

Eschaton aftermath
Burying trust
Even this psychopath
Learns to adjust

What if it's too late to suffer?
What if it's too late to die?

As we rise
Seeking shelter from our sins
We'll escape
From the universe within
In a time
When the veil is growing thin
We'll take flight
From the universe within
As we rise

We're unwanted pariahs
At the governance doors
With the finalization
Of what's happened before

As we rise
Seeking shelter from our sins
We'll escape
From the universe within
In a time
When the veil is growing thin
We'll take flight
From the universe within

Luminous deity
Perilous djinn
Sacrificed unity
Servants of sin

Ominous spiritus
Reaper of souls
Living in all of us
Seizing control
As we rise
