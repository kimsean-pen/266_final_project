All the damage has been done
No sense wondering who went wrong
No point trading battle scars
Either way I suffered way too long

I believe in second chances
But where'd we even start?
Even start?
Nothing good is ever easy
But it shouldn't be this hard
Be this hard

I can't be afraid of being lonely
Gonna do this my own way
Tonight I'm gonna do my own thing
I'm getting closer to having closure
Gonna do this my own way
Tonight I'm gonna do my own thing
And I suggest you do the same

Feeling numb or feeling true
Caught my feelings catching you
You can blame me all you want to
But I hate that I can't stop hating you
Let's put an end to all this madness
It starts with you

I believe in second chances
But where'd we even start?
Even start?
Nothing good is ever easy
But it shouldn't be this hard
Be this hard

I can't be afraid of being lonely
Gonna do this my own way
Tonight I'm gonna do my own thing
I'm getting closer to having closure
Gonna do this my own way
Tonight I'm gonna do my own thing
And I suggest you do the same

Oh, oh, oh
Getting closer to closure
Oh, oh, oh
Getting closer to closure
Getting closer to closure

No such thing as second chances
It's clear we fell apart, fell apart

I can't be afraid of being lonely
Gonna do this my own way
Tonight I'm gonna do my own thing
I'm getting closer to having closure
Gonna do this my own way
Tonight I'm gonna do my own thing
And I suggest you do the same

Oh, oh, oh
Getting closer to closure
Oh, oh, oh
Getting closer to closure
