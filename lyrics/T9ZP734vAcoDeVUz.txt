[Rachel]
[Come on girls! Do you believe in love? 'Cause I got something to say about it. And it goes something like this...]

[All]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Rachel]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen carat gold
[Quinn]
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no, no
[Mercedes]
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like the queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

[All]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Tina]
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
[Santana]
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
[Rachel]
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

[All]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

(Express yourself) You've got to make him
(Express himself) Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
(Hey!) He'll be back on his knees, so please

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

(Express yourself) You've got to make him
(Express himself) Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Put your love to the test!)
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
(Make him show you how he feels)
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

Express yourself
Express yourself
So if you want it right now, better make him show you how
(Show you how)
(Baby, ready or not)

Express yourself!
Express yourself!
(You know, you know, you know)
So if you want it right now, better make him show you how
Express yourself
