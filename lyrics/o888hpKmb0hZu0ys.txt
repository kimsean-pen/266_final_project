I got my pride, my self-respect
Need nothing more, want nothing less
'Cause all that I got should be enough to make it work
'Cause all that I want is to love and just be loved

I'll never let it go 'cause we can do this on our own
I'll never let it go, we have too much to let it fall
I'll never let it go 'cause we can do this on our own
I'll never let it go, we have too much to let it fall

And I won't let anybody tell me no
I won't take anything for granted
'Cause I know that nothing good comes easy
If it did I wouldn't be me
Let it go and let me do it 'cause
I won't, I won't
I won't, I won't
I won't, I won't
I won't, I won't

I got my heart, my head up high
I will be strong, I will survive
'Cause all of the hurt will wash away with the rain
And all that we've learned will be enough to shine again

I'll never let it go 'cause we can do this on our own
I'll never let it go, we have too much to let it fall
I'll never let it go 'cause we can do this on our own
I'll never let it go, we have too much to let it fall

And I won't let anybody tell me no
I won't take anything for granted
'Cause I know that nothing good comes easy
If it did I wouldn't be me
Let it go and let me do it 'cause
I won't, I won't
I won't (whoa), I won't
I won't (I won't), I won't
I won't, I won't

Hold your head up (hold your head), see the daylight
Hold your head up (hold your head up) 'cause your future's looking bright (yeah)
Hold your head up, see the daylight
Hold your head up 'cause your future's looking bright (oh)

Hold your head up, see the daylight (these stones and sticks are what makes me)
Hold your head up 'cause your future's looking bright (these stones and sticks are all I need)
Hold your head up, see the daylight (these stones and sticks are what makes me)
Hold your head up 'cause (these stones and sticks are all I needed)

I won't let anybody tell me no
I won't take anything for granted
'Cause I know that nothing good comes easy
If it did I wouldn't be me
Let it go and let me do it just
I won't (hey), I won't
I won't (I won't, I won't, I won't), I won't (yeah)
I won't, I won't
I won't (oh), I won't
I won't
