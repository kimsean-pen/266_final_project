There's this boy I know whose afraid of the ocean
Never quite found love he drank the love potion
I'll be on the chain smoking in the basement shattered like the windows

All my life I was born to lead worry not just leave me be I'll abide till the end
I'll take it all on the chin for you my friend

Find my bag of bones at the back of the station
Said make yourself at home so I started day drinking
Till I believe in time after 7 8 or 9 you fall yourself to pieces

I'll take it all on the chin for you my friend
