I've been looking in the dark
For a place to hide my heart
And it's killing me.
I forgot forgot forgot
The world isn't just a thought
And it's killing me.

Be my flower girl.
Cause things can't get any less perfect
Be my flower girl.
Cause we can't get any less perfect

I've been wasting all my time
Counting crimes behind my eyes
And they're stealing me.
I'm lost I'm lost I'm lost.
I'm a loser without cause.
And you're missing me.

Be my flower girl
Cause things can't get any less perfect
Be my flower girl
Cause we can't get any less perfect

I'm not ready to be happy
But if you would take my hand
And lay me down so softly
I think I'd make it out just fine.
