Bird in the hand, two in the bush
Define your intentions in truth
Abandon abandon
But never ever say what you ran from
Staring at the fragments
In your sleep laughing
Thought crime champion
Take another ambium
Back to the wall but the ceiling's still cracking

Young, unassuming
Eucalyptus blooming
Masquerade of masochists
Said I'm only human
Five past eleven, ten past dead
Twenty to the hour til the hour spells dread
Fortunes to the killer who's convinced he's a healer
Give a smile to the patient
You know the connotation
Maggot in the mallet
Feel the force of the malice
Killer cannae cut it cos he couldnae get the credit

I spy
She's looking for love
She's looking for love

I am the lion, the lead
Turn on the fawcett
Let the gas blast
[?] emotion
From a womanizer
Booze on her body
[?] contender
Signs of a [?]
You'll always remember
[?], living on the throne
Let it be known, [?] unknown

I spy
She's looking for love
She's looking for trouble
In the wrong places
In the wrong places
