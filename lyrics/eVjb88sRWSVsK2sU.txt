Lying in bed, I hear the clock tick and I think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories, time after
Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow," I fall behind
(The second hand unwinds)

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

Then you say, "Go slow," I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
