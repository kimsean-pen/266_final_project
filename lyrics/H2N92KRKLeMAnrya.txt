Hey there fancypants
Play the songs that make us dance
Play the tunes that make the ladies swoon
A song for all the lonely hearts, shattered dreams and broken parts
Feels like sunny days are coming soon

Hey Mr. Buttercup
Spin the wheel and try your luck
The spotlight's shining bright tonight on you
Bring along your lady friend, do a dance from way back when
Tonight's the night when all your dreams come true

Hey there sour grapes
Down in the dumps, long in the face
Drinkin' down your dinner, all alone
Feelin' bad, feelin' blue, tonight the rainbow ends with you
So sit on down and make yourself at home... So

Hey there fancypants
Play the songs that make us dance
Play the tunes that make the ladies swoon
A song for all the lonely hearts, shattered dreams and broken parts
Feels like sunny days are coming soon
