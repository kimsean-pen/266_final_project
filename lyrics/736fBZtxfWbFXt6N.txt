Life is cheap, bitter sweet
But it tastes good to me

Take my turn, crash and burn
Thats how its supposed to be

So don't rain on my parade
Life's too short to waste one day

I'm gonna risk it all
The freedom to fall
Yes its sure looks good to me

Time passed by and leaves you behind
Taken naturally

Heaven knows (OH) There's so much more
More than what we see

So don't rain on my parade
Life's to short to waste one day

I'm gonna risk it all to
The freedom to fall
Yes its sure looks good to me

(HEY) It sure looks good to me

Ooh, ooh, oooo, oohh
Yea, yea, yea

Ooh, ooh, oooo, oohh
Yea, yea, yea

Deep in my mind Im secure we can buy
I wanna see life before I die or a lie in an empty space

The darkness comes and I've been telling my soul
And me and myself we turn around, we're getting old

But the lightning crashing, foolish emotions
Of the bruises and the beauty of this moment that we're feeling

And I feel like I'm seeing the world inside of me
But I can tell you that I know, its getting easy and I'm free

There's a cold in the morning, endless equation
Of who've we become, it's a complex situation

So live, love, life give love
Live, love, life give love
Live, love, life give love

Cuz who are we anyway?

So don't rain on my parade
Life's to short to waste one day

I'm gonna risk it all
The freedom to fall
Yes its sure looks good to me

(HEY) It sure looks good to me
(I'm telling you) It sure looks good to me

(YEA) It sure looks good to me

Looks good to me, yea, yea, yea
