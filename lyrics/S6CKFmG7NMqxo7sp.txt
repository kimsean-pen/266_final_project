I'm just a drop in the ocean
A tiny grain of sand
Trying to run for the shoreline
But we're miles away from land

Just lay me down beside you
Cause we've nowhere left to go
Down beneath the waves love
We move so soft and slow
So soft and slow

We hold on to each other tight
Waiting for dawn's early light
Srtanded petrified
We're waiting for the end
Down by the bayside
Where death greets you like a long lost friend

Here comes the tide
Wait for a lifeline
Place your fingers in mine
We'll wait for a lifetime again

Help me find a way
Back to the start again
I've strayed too far from view
And now there's no help left to send
If I go does the world keep spinning without me
Cause if it does I don't want to know
As time slows just give me to the ocean
Steal my heart and soul
Steal my heart and soul
Steal my heart and soul

Here comes the tide
Wait for a lifeline
Place your fingers in mine
We'll wait for a lifetime
