Fall to your knees
Accomplishing nothing
Fall to your knees only to exercise your schedule
Abandon calender

What has come with such preaching is loneliness

Profit: Zero
Achievement: Zero

Forward can't be stopped
It just goes to show that some words are useless
It just goes to show that some words are useless
Take all your medals
Take all your ribbons
Take all your awards
Take them
Take them back to the ground

Our youth is lost
A product of the created circumstances

All I can say is maybe, maybe, maybe
All I can say is maybe this is what I've been expecting all along
All along

Now's the time of weakness
Now's the time of blood
Perhaps even the whole-hearted had wished for this

Now's the time of weakness
Now's the time of blood
And still the time of lions

Push everything
Force everything
We've all sung of the end, but who truly understands it?

All along, all along
Forward can't be stopped
It just goes to show that some words are useless
it just goes to show that some words are useless
Take all your medals
Take all your ribbons
Take all your awards
Take them back to the ground
