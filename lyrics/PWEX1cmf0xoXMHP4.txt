Rode my bike to your mom's house
Ten miles on the other side of town
I remember everything down to your perfume
Your brother playing Rancid in the back room
Years went by and I'm still stuck
Heard you settled down and you grew up
Tell me, is he everything you wanted?
Really hope so
You deserve the best and nothing less

You held my hands, looked me in the face
You said you needed space,
And you never called back
Was I a mistake?
Something to replace?
Someone to throw away?
I'll wait for you to call back

You held my hands, looked me in the face
You said you needed space,
And you never called back
Was I a mistake?
Something to replace?
Someone to throw away?
I'll wait for you to call back

And I've been going through the motions
Even though I've been broken
Even though you left me high and dry
It's a wonder why I'm still hoping
Same shit, just a different day
I don't get why I can't turn the page
Ice cold since you went away
I can feel it all running in my veins
And I can still feel it and
I can still see your reflection
And nowadays I don't feel
Anything but the depression
And I don't get why I can't move
On and live in the present
It's like the past is my home and
I'm working on trying to forget it

You held my hands, looked me in the face
You said you needed space,
And you never called back
Was I a mistake?
Something to replace?
Someone to throw away?
I'll wait for you to call back

Well, I don't want to wake up anymore
When every day is feeling
Longer than the day before
You got, well, everything that you asked for
Just let me be face down on the fucking floor

You held my hands,
Looked me in the face
You said you needed space,
And you never called back
Was I a mistake?
Something to replace?
Someone to throw away?
I'll wait for you to call back

Do you forgive me?
Took you for granted and
I brought this on myself
'Cause I'll forgive you for leaving me
It was all my fucking fault
