Man, I've had a few
But they wouldn't quite blow me like you
you gave me your name and signed
With a halo around my eye

And it hit me like never before
That love is a powerful force
Yes, it struck me that love is a sport
So I pushed you a little bit more

Love, you're news to me
you're a little bit more than I thought you'd be
a mole in my well-fed lawn
you're a nightmare beating the dawn

Oh, it hit me like never before
that love is a powerful force
yes, it struck me that love is sport
so I pushed you a little bit more

Blue, blue, black and blue
red blood sticks like glue
true love is cruel love
red blood's a power-fuel
sweet love, tasty blood
my heart overfloods

Oh you hit me!
Yeah, you hit me really hard
man, you hit me!
yeah you hit me right in the heart

Lord, I've had my deal
but I never quite knew how it feels
when love makes you wake up sore
with fists that are ready for more

And it hit me that love is a game
like in war no one can be blamed
yes, it struck me that love is a sport
so I pushed you a little bit more

Oh, blue, blue, black and blue
red blood sticks like glue
true love is cruel love
red blood's a power fuel
sweet love tasted blood
my heart overfloods

Man, you hit me!
Yeah you hit me really hard
baby, you hit me!
Yeah you punched me right in the heart
and then you kissed me

And then you hit me
And then you kissed me
And then you hit me

Oh, you haunt me with your violent heartbeat at night
oh, you strike me with your silence baby, tonight
why you haunt me with your violence baby, come hit me!
You haunt me with your violent heartbeat
