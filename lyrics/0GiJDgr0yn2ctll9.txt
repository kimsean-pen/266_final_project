While we're wild and free
We'll skip like were stones on the sea
Sing like the birds in the trees
That crow outside your window

While we're new and young
We'll shine like a morning sun
No matter the seasons that come and go
Or which way the wind blows
Every time you go I'll see
Just how my world comes crashing round me
And if you want to stay
I don't think I'd for nothing more

But if you'll go, I'll go
Oh if you'll go, I'll go
Oh if you'll go, then I'll go
As long as you want me to stay

While our love is green
Forget the troubles we've seen
Forget the people we've been
Before all of the mistakes
And heart breaks and oh my love

While stars they shine
While your heart is mine
Yeah while there's music and wine
Let us dance all the time
Let us pull down the stars
Let us tug on the lines
Let us smile till we laugh
Let us laugh till we cry
Let us fall in a heap
Under diamond skies

Cos every time you go I'll see
Just how my world comes crashing round me
And if you want to stay
I don't think I'd for nothing more

Cuz if you'll go I'll go
Oh if you'll go I'll go
Oh if you'll go then I'll go
As long as you want me to stay

And I'll stay
'Till the sun falls out of the sky
I'll stay, I'll stay
'Till all of the rivers run dry

But if you'll go, I'll go
Oh if you'll go, I'll go
Oh if you'll go then I'll go
As long as you want me to stay

Oh I, as long as you want me to stay
Oh I, as long as you want me to stay
