You are my sunbeam
when skies are dark
You got me flying, way beyond.
'Cause I've been
wandering and feeling lost

Now, like whirlwind,
you put a spell on me.
Have been dragging
my feet along sleepless everyday,

I couldn't figure out a thing.
Until your lightbeam
came crashing in
Waited five seconds,
soaked in some magic, shoot across
To transform my every loss,
But then you came storming.

You are my sunbeam
when skies are dark
You got me flying way beyond.
'Cause I've been
wandering and feeling lost

Now, like whirlwind,
you put a spell on me.
Your electric ways
had me right then
Me and my ghost of
the past, get him tied down.
Waited five seconds,
soaked in some magic, come across
To transform my every
loss, but then

You came storming in.
You are my sunbeam
when skies are dark
You got me flying way beyond.
'Cause I've been
wandering and feeling lost,
Now, like whirlwind,
you put a spell on me.
Ye-eh-eh-y.
