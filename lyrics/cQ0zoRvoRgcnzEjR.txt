Revenge!
Revenge!
Revenge!
Revenge!
Killed my hopes (Revenge!)
Called me names (Revenge!)
Broke my jaw (Revenge!)
It's always the same (Revenge!)
Nobody listens
Nobody listens
Nobody listens
There's no escape
Im just like you
I gave it my everything
Nobody loves me
It's driving me insane
Killed my hopes (Revenge!)
Called me names (Revenge!)
Broke my jaw (Revenge!)
It's always the same (Revenge!)
Nobody listens
Nobody listens
Nobody listens
Nobody listens
Why do you all hate me?
Everyone's against me
Mommy dont care
Daddy cant help
You made it hell
Everyday
Called me names
I wanna die
Maybe I can find a way
To make you all
Go away
I never lied
Never cried
Never fell
Never crawled
I was just like you
Now you'll pay
With your fucking life
I went to dad's closet
I picked up his .45
Grabbed three boxes of bullets
And on my hip they shall reside
Until I opened the gym doors
You should have seen those fucks run
I poured out a full clip
In their backs I got some
I've finally found my smile
It's pure and blood stained
So who's the bitch now?
I'll paint the lockers with your brains
Nothing can help this fucking pain in my heart
Nothing compares to this pain in my heart
Nothing can take away this pain in my heart
But your blood on my hands
Well at least it's a start
