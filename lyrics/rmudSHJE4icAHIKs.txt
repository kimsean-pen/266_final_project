Is it hard to break up
The barriers we have built up?
Sound of empty vessels
Echoes in the gossips
Let's make it to a shelter
Where nobody will whisper
We're getting into something
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Take my hand
Follow me
Memorize
All the dreams we had

They say I'm guilty
They can't be trusted
That might be tricky
But you gotta be above

Ten months of static
I'm wrapped in plastic
So come and save me
Out of this grave

Do you
Feel my heart's still beating
Through the veil I hear you call my name
And I'm sinking down again

Seat beside, don't leave me
Through the veil I hear you call my name
From the other side

A shadow dance
Reflecting lights in a dark
Let's cry out loud
As if there's nobody else

I wanna try
To live the moment for once
Wild glowing sky
Reveal the things as they are

How did I get here?
No, I don't deserve this!
Just wanna bring up those long gone days oh
Again and again
Again and again
A shattered mirror
That I have become

Take my hand
Follow me
Memorize
All the dreams we had

Feel my heart's still beating
Through the veil I hear you call my name
And I'm sinking down again

Seat beside, don't leave me
Through the veil I hear you call my name
From the other side

How did I get here?
No, I don't deserve this!
Just wanna bring up those long gone days oh
Again and again
Again and again
A shattered mirror
That I have become

Who can tell me
Am I awake now?
Or still I'm stuck in here
Is there a way out?

How did I get here?
No, I don't deserve this!
Just wanna bring up those long gone days oh
Again and again
Again and again
A shattered mirror
That I have become

How did I get here?
No, I don't deserve this!
Just wanna bring up those long gone days oh
Again and again
Again and again
A shattered mirror
That I have become
