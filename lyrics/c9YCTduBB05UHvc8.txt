They say it's insane when
You think somebody is gonna change when
They won't
I'm getting tired of this recital
Is it really worth figthing for
Young lovers seems care free
These bags have gotten heavy again
I think is time to brake the pattern
Blame it on return the silence

A lonely road to nowhere
That's all we are

I wish I never met you
You told me so wrong
I wish I could forget you
It's been way too long
It's been sixteen hours and three long years
Been trying wipe these memories and dry these tears
I wish I never met you
That's how much I regret you

Contemplate in silence
You often no violence to me
You have me feeded like a crackhead
I squeeze you out just like a black head
Nobody is gonna save you
And I know better than to blame you alone
I leave it and take the last chance
But now I leave you with the ashes

A lonely road to nowhere
That's all we are

I wish I never met you
You told me so wrong
I wish I could forget you
It's been way too long
It's been sixteen hours and three long years
Been trying wipe these memories and dry these tears
I wish I never met you
That's how much I regret you

And now the flames just to flicker
Down to the wick
Now tell me who's gonna kill it?
It burns until you snap it out
I wanna rub you out
But love's gonna trick you
I thought we'd ...
Take it down like a brick that's tied to you
Putting you down
Watch me drown

It's been 16 hours and 3 long years
Been trying to wipe these memories and dry these tears
I wish I never met you
That's how much I regret you

It's been 16 hours and 3 long years
Been trying to wipe these memories and dry these tears
I wish I never met you
That's how much I regret you

I wish I never met you
That's how much I regret you
