When this old world starts a getting me down
And people are much too much for me to take
I climb right up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space

On the roof is the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Up on the roof

When I get home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I get away from the hustlin' crowd
And all that rat-race noise down in the street

At night the stars put on a show for free
And darlin' you can share it all with me
Let's go
I keep telling you

Right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's troubleproof
And if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two
Up on the roof
Up on the roof
Come on baby, come on baby
Up on the roof
Up on the roof

End
