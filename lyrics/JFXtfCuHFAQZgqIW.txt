You scream out
Try not to repeat
Hazemazes
Try to be discreet
You tell them
The secrets of your mind
But the answer
Still you cannot find
OH!
Now your tryin'
Tryin' to be true
Hazemazes
Tryin' to get to you
Well it will end
Where it began
With your body
Placed beneath the sand
OH!
In again
The cycle never ends
Made of skin
Forgive your human sin
I found the truth
It came from our hand
It spoke with force
It came from the sand
And it said
It spoke with sound
It will amaze
Open up your ears
Hear the great voice
As it says

End
