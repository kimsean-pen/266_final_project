Last night I dreamed that you'd murdered some kids
Gone up towards the border where the freaks live
I couldn't tolerate it, yet somehow I did
If it had been on TV I would've changed the channel
And afterwards I lay awake for quite some time
And thought about opinions I'd kept
At five in the morning I couldn't tolerate it
How many had died while I slept?

Now is the time to cast Darwin aside
Stop spinning lines that justify the lure of suicide
And reach out your hands
And save someone's life
Because war is coming

If you want it
War is coming
If you want it

She's keeping quiet in a season of crime
Walking away as if nothing had changed

From that awful display
People are strange
If they keep on laughing
Nothing will change

Now is the time to cast the screenplay aside
And try to create some space between the lines
To lift up your voice
And change someone's mind
Because war is coming
If you want it
War is coming
If you want it
War is coming
If you want it
War is coming
If you want it
War is coming
If you want it
War is coming
If you want it
