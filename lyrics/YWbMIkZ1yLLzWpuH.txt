Walking on the moon
[?], one moment to escape
People set your world
Let me walking on the moon
Chase
Your happy place
It won't change your crew
Let me dancing on the moon
Let me dance again
All the trouble seems to fade away
This is how I feel
Let me take me to some levels that I've never been
When we dance again
All the trouble seems to fade away
This is how I feel
Let me take me some places that I've never been
When we dance again
That I've never been
Walking on the moon
[?], one moment to escape
People change your world
When we walking on the moon
Chase
Your happy place
It won't change your crew
When we dancing on the moon
When we dance again
All the trouble seems to fade away
This is how I feel
When you take me to some levels that I've never been
When we dance again
All the trouble seems to fade away
This is how I feel
Let me take me to some places that I've never been
When we dance again
