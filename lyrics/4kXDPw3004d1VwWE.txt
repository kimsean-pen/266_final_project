It goes on and on and on
I knew theres something going wrong
You kept looking all around
And got my head turned upside down
You know what the other boys could do
I think its time for something new
So here take my hand it's all for you
And lets do what we wanna do
Me and you, me and you
Like monkeys in the summer, monkeys in the summer

I wanted you to be my baby girl tonight
And all the other boys could just say goodbye
And once you get a little piece of mine
You can just set all of those other boys aside
(Aside)

And I know you've got it going on
So I swear it won't take too long
To drop Jimmy Jon and ron
And get you under my arm
I promise I'll be good to you
And I think its time for something new
Here take my hand it's all for you
And lets do what we wanna do
Me and you, me and you
Like monkeys in the summer, monkeys in the summer

I wanted you to be my baby girl tonight
And all the other boys could just say goodbye
And once you get a little piece of mine
You can just set all of those other boys aside
(Aside)

So you are my baby girl -irl -irl -irl
We rule the world -orld -orld -orld
You can break my heart
You can break my heart
You can break my heart

I wanted you to be my baby girl tonight
And all the other boys could just say goodbye
And once you get a little piece of mine
You can just set all of those other boys aside
(Aside)
