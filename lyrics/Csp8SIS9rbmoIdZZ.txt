Where do you go
Whenever it gets serious?
Your reasons are old
I'm overcome with weariness
I heard you're in Mexico
But move around, never settle long
You took two years in Tokyo
An insincere attempt to grow

So tell me
How can we still be friends
When we're just a love that didn't happen
And can never happen

So tell me
How can we still be friends
When we're just a love that didn't happen
And can never happen again

Your heart is a lie
You've strung together to buy some time
It's so easy to call
But isn't love disposable
Nowhere for this to go
You left it all, you left me low
Send some word, to raise a hope
Or let it fall to the sea below

So tell me
How can we still be friends
When we're just a love that didn't happen
And can never happen

So tell me
How can we still be friends
When we're just a love that didn't happen
And can never happen again
