Sha la la, dooby wah
Dum dum dum, yeh yeh, um
Sha la la, dooby wah
Dum dum dum, yeh yeh um

Oh, blue angel, don't you cry
Just because he said goodbye
Oh, ahh ahh ahh
No, don't cry.

Oh, blue angel, have no fear
I'll brush away each lonely teardrop
Hey hey, whoa whoa.

Well, love's precious flame just burned in vain
But you're not to blame
He thought love was a game and it's oh such a shame
But don't you cry, don't sigh, I'll tell you why
I'll never say goodbye blue angel.

Sha la la, dooby wah
Dum dum dum, yeh yeh, um
Wah wah wah wah
Dum dum dum dum dum dum

We'll have love so fine
Magic moments divine
If you'll just say you're mine
I'll love you till the end of time.

Don't you worry, you pretty head
I'll never let you down
I'll always be around
Blue angel

Sha la la, dooby wah
Dum dum dum, yeh yeh, um
Blue angel
Sha la la
