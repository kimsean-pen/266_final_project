It's about time we put our knees in the cement
It's been killing you to say so lets begin
I'm fetching you more then you'd like me to believe
It comes in many forms of excuses and at least

Look them in the eyes tell them what they want to hear
Yeah that what everyone falls my dear
Look me in the eyes tell me what I want to hear
You know I'll never fall for it

But when you need a boy around
You just for the summer
Don't come knocking on my door
When you need a boy around you
You just for the summer
Don't come knocking on my door

Got time I wont wait another minute
So tell me lies I'll let you finish
Your stretching me more than I'd liking to admit
It's goes without say that you have a lot to do with it

Look them in the eyes tell them what they want to hear
Yeah that what everyone falls my dear
Look me in the eyes tell me what I want to hear
You know I'll never fall for it

But when you need a boy around
You just for the summer
Don't come knocking on my door
When you need a boy around you
You just for the summer
Don't come knocking on my door

Don't waste my time
Your never gonna change my mind
When you need a boy around you
You just for the summer
Don't come knocking on my door

(Solo)

Look them in the eyes tell them what they want to hear
Yeah that what everyone falls my dear
Look me in the eyes tell me what I want to hear
I wont fall for it No!

So when you need someone around you
When you need someone around you
Don't come knocking on my door

Need a boy around you just for the summer
Don't come knocking on my door
When you need a boy around you just for the summer
Don't come knocking on my door

Don't Waste my time
Your never gonna change my mind
When you need a boy around you just for the summer

Don't come knocking on my door

Don't come knocking on my door

When you need a boy around you

When you need a boy around you
