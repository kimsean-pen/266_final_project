In a haze, every winter's morning
The sunrise, in all it's glory
Defeated the night once again
This is a love I cannot comprehend
White wolf, you are home
Where the free and lonely roam
Under the afterglow
With guidance, I am whole
Follow the footprints in the snow
Incomprehensive mind, I forget you from time to time
Blue eyes inside the lines, and a coat of pale white
Reoccurring dreams, what a calming sight
A luminous stare, that brings me peace of mind
(Isolated, I am the one who walks alone)
I am, remnants of anything that survived
I am, a new being on the inside
Fear is the only thing I've ever left behind
Winter solstice brings the harshest age
And the sun will rarely show it's face
Smoke signals, over the trees
The bitter cold, shifting all throughout the leaves
A place for one, the prodigal son
Wisdom comes in waves, and is given to none
Forced to survive
I hope I'm still alone in your eyes
You are home
White wolf, you are home
Where the free and lonely roam
Under the afterglow
With guidance, I am whole
Follow the footprints in the snow
In silence, I am noise
With vibrance, there's no void
A thousand eyes watching me
They will see me watching back
And with fear left behind
My future is already written
White wolf of the night
You are my only guiding light
White wolf of the night
You are my only guiding light
