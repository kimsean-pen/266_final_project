Hear my silence, see my blindness
a love ascending, and never ending
you did cut me, from the same tree
a love incision, my inner vision

Loving on our hands and knees
always trying hard to please
never in my life have I
questioned or discovered why

Live and discover
take from each other
a love believing
and never decieving

Loving on our hands and knees
always trying hard to please
never in my life have I
questioned or discovered why

Him say leave now
give and believe how
a love revealing
my inner feeling
