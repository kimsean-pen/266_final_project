I almost crumbled
I almost fell
I almost gave you everything under your spell

You almost mattered
You almost won
You held my fears and weakness, in the web you spun
Took what you wanted

But you're leaving with nothing
I'll carry on, I'll carry on
I'll carry on, my chin
Hope you enjoyed it
But you're leaving with nothing

Nothing, nothing
This war has started
Rivers parted

But I'm gonna face my fears
Give it all that I've got
I'll give it all that I've got
Let the healing start
This war has started
Rivers parted
But I'm gonna cry no tears

Give it all that I've got
I'll give it all that I've got
Let the healing start
I almost stumbled
When you shot me down
You almost got the best of me and stole my crown
The glass was shattered

As it hit the ground
The scent have a way not for you, reach over now
Took what you wanted
But you're leaving with nothing

Nothing, nothing
This war has started
Rivers parted
But I'm gonna face my fears

Give it all that I've got
I'll give it all that I've got
Let the healing start
This war has started

Rivers parted
But I'm gonna cry no tears
Give it all that I've got
I'll give it all that I've got
Let the healing start
This war has started
Rivers parted

But I'm gonna face my fears
Give it all that I've got
I'll give it all that I've got
Let the healing start
This war has started
Rivers parted
But I'm gonna cry no tears
Give it all that I've got
I'll give it all that I've got
Let the healing start
I almost crumbled
I almost fell
I almost gave you everything but you've failed
