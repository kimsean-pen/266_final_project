Doo doo doo
Doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo

I'm packed and I'm holdin'
I'm smilin', she's livin', she's golden
She lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation
Her own motivation
She comes round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile
Like a drug for you
Do ever what you wanna do
Comin' over you
Keep on smilin' what we go through
One stop to the rhythm, that divides you

And I speak to you like the to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said

I want somethin' else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life
Baby, baby
I want somethin' else
I'm not listenin' when you say
Good-bye

Doo doo doo
Doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo

The sky was gold
It was rose
I was takin' sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Someplace back there
Smilin' in the pictures you would take
Doin' crystal meth
Will lift you up until you break
It won't stop
I won't come down
I keep stock with the tick-tock rhythm
I bump for the drop
And then I bumped up
I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again
Then I bumped again
I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you
How do I get myself back to the place where you said

I want somethin' else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life
Baby, baby
I want somethin' else
I'm not listenin' when you say
Good-bye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling
An earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright
Alright

And when the plane came in
She said she was crashin'
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess
I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly
Face down on the mattress
One

And you hold me
And we're broken
Still it's all that I wanna do
Just a little now
Feel myself
Heading off the ground
I'm scared
I'm not comin' down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now
Locked down in a smile
But nothin' is alright
Alright

And I want somethin' else
To get me through this life
Baby, I want somethin' else
Not listenin' when you say
Good-bye
Good-bye
Good-bye
Good-bye

Doo doo doo
Doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo

The sky was gold
It was rose
I was takin' sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Someplace back there
In the place we used to start

Doo doo doo
Doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo-doo doo

I want somethin' else
