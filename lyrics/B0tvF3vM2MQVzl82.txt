You, you're on my mind,
Like double time,
I'm startin' to need you.
I can't seem to find,
Another light,
I only repeat you
You're on my,
You're on my,
You're on my mi-i-i-ind
You're on my mi-i-i-ind
I must admit
You're on my
You're on my mi-i-i-ind
I can't resist
You're on my
You're on my mi-i-i-ind

They don't say that I'm crazy
They don't say that I'm wrong
You make me so weak
Boy, Ive never felt so strong
My head feel like a miracle
Bouncin' like I'm a popsicle
You're the one that I'm looking for
I got somethin' that you should know

You, you're on my mind,
Like double time,
I'm startin' to need you.
I can't seem to find,
Another light,
I only repeat you
You're on my mi-i-i-ind
You're on my mi-i-i-ind
I must admit
You're on my
You're on my mi-i-i-ind
I can't resist
You're on my
You're on my mi-i-i-ind

Girlfriends don't get it,
"Pia, what are you on?"
Say that I'll regret it
Oh, I'm already gone
Clound 9, n' I'm dreamin' now
So high n' I'm freaking out
I'm addicted to the sound
I ain't never comin' down

You, you're on my mind,
Like double time,

I'm startin' to need you.
I can't seem to find,
Another light,
I only repeat you
You're on my,
You're on my,

You're on my mi-i-i-ind
You're on my mi-i-i-ind
I must admit
You're on my
You're on my mi-i-i-ind
I can't resist
You're on my
You're on my mi-i-i-ind

On, My, Mind
I'm starting to need
Seem to find
I only repeat
On, My, Mind
I'm starting to need
Seem to find
I only repeat
