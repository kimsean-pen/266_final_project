Oooh ooh ooh ooh oooooh
I wanna be good to you baby, ooh
(Call me crazy but I think I found the love of my life, that's right)
How you ever felt warm on a cold, cold night?
That's how it get you when you least expect it, and you can't reject it
That crazy little tingling feeling pain in your chest yes

You feel that fire, just let it burn
There's no runnin' when it's your turn
(Call me crazy but I think I found the love of my life)
Just let it burn
Let it, let it burn
Just let it burn
Let it, let it burn
(Call me crazy but I think I found the love of my life)

Feel it creepin' in your heart
Ooh baby can you feel it tearing you apart?
That's right that's love
When it comes, you never wanna give it up
And baby, I'm caught in the light and I ain't gonna fight it
There's no use in tryin', I'm yours
And I want you to want me the way that I would you and more

So if you ready to take this ride
We could go all around the world baby
Shit, we could even go to the stars if you like

I know it's scary
Cause someone always gets hurt when you're caring
And I felt that way too
But ready or not, it's coming for you

You feel that fire, just let it burn
There's no runnin' when it's your turn
(Call me crazy but I think I found the love of my life)
Just let it burn
Let it, let it burn
Just let it burn
Let it, let it burn
(Call me crazy but I think I found the love of my life)

You can't get away from love
Come on yours and get you some
Watch what It'll make you do
Knock the cool right outta you (that's love)

You feel that fire, just let it burn
There's no runnin' when it's your turn
(Call me crazy but I think I found the love of my life)
Just let it burn
Let it, let it burn
Just let it burn
Let it, let it burn
(Call me crazy but I think I found the love of my life)
