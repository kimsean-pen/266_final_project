Sell all you have give it to the kittens
And pour the milk on Louis' grave
And Catland sometimes called Pussydom
Opens for you instantly it's the inmost light!
It's the inmost light
Somewhere over the rainbow
On the good ship lollipop

There oh there
(Goodnight)
The inmost light
The happy children rise all from their pools
Eyes still sealed
(Sleeptight)
With mud and night
It's their inmost night
(Goodnight)

And yet still I which i could dream as when young
(Sleeptight)
As she came to me so young and honest
(Goodbye)

Yet the bloodbells chime
I do not notice them
I shall not notice them
Yet the bloodbells chime

Tommy Katkins still send his regards
Frozen for ever on some animal somme
The last thing on his mind is marriage
But the call of home and heart

Yet the bloodbells chime
Yet the bloodbells chime
Yet the bloodbells chime
