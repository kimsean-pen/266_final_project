I thought i had everybody on my side
But I went and blew it all sky high
And now she wont even spare a passing glance
All just because i (rip) ripped my pants

(Singing)
When big larry came round just to put him down
Spongebob turned into a clown
And no girl ever wants to dance
with a fool who went and (rip) ripped his pants

I no I shouldnt mope around I shouldnt curse
But the pain feels so much worse
Cause windin up with no1 is a lot less fun then a burn
from the sun Or sand in your buns!

Now I learned a lesson I wont soon forget
So listen and u wont regret
Be true to urself dont miss your chance
and u wont end up like the fool who ripped
his pants
