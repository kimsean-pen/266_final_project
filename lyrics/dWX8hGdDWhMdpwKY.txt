If a girl walks in
Calls her name of my heart
I turn and run away
Everyday will...
It's hard to be lucky in love
Open fire... open fire...

Do you believe in heaven above
Do you believe in love
Don't tell a lie, don't be false or true
All comes back to you
Open fire... open fire...

Open fire on my burning heart
I've never been lucky in love
My defenses are down
A kiss or a frown
I can't survive on my own

Tears in your eyes
Is making me crying

Don't know what to do, don't know what to do
Looking for love
Calling heaven above

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now

Empty dreams can only disappoint
A ruin behind your smile
Don't give up, don't give up
You can be lucky in love

Tears in your eyes
Is making me crying
Don't know what to do, don't know what to do
Looking for love
Calling heaven above
