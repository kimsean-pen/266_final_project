Why don't you feel me?
I'm so in need
Is it a wonder I resist from you?

I was the one who fell in this game
Then you took me away from you

I'm fine without you now
I don't need you here
I'm fine without you now
Can you disappear?

I'm fine without you now
I've given you my heart
I'm fine without you now
I've given you... given you everything

I'm fine without you now
I've given you my heart
I'm fine without you now
I've given you... I've given you everything

I've given you everything

I've given you everything

You've made it clear now
This is the end
No more good byes and sympathies... from me

All you still want is a physical thing?
But you've taken enough from me

I'm fine without you now
I don't need you here
I'm fine without you now
Can you disappear?

I'm fine without you now
I've given you my heart
I'm fine without you now
I've given you... given you everything

I'm fine without you now
I've given you my heart
I'm fine without you now
I've given you... I've given you everything

I've given you everything

I've given you everything

I've given you everything
