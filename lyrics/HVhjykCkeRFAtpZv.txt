Eh, eh, eh, eh

M.I.A. you can wiki me
I don't be no dummenee
Dumbing me is killing me
Like it can be that enemy
They come at me
They gonna meet my
People gonna cover me
The ones that govern me
Ain't the ones that can power me
It's the sun and moon
That's turning me
If I get high it's burning me
You can kill my privacy
But you can't kill that love in me

It's a game can't be tamed
Keep your fame and I'll keep my faith
(Oh yeah you can keep it)
Store my name, say my name
Know my name, and I'll keep my faith
(I'm gonna keep it)
Light it up, turn em on
That's when my powers gone
(gonna keep it)
I take em off, turn em off, and my powers on

Eh, eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh, eh

Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off
Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off
Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off
Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off

It's a game can't be tamed
Keep your fame and I'll keep my faith
(Oh yeah you can keep it)
Store my name, say my name
Know my name, and I'll keep my faith
(I'm gonna keep it)
Light it up, turn em on
That's when my powers gone
(gonna keep it)
I take em off, turn em off, and my powers on

Eh, eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh, eh

Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off
Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off
Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off
Pan 'em off, pan 'em, pan 'em off

It's a game can't be tamed
Keep your fame and I'll keep my faith
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Store my name, say my name
Know my name, and I'll keep my faith
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Light it up, turn em on
That's when my powers gone
I take em off, turn em off, and my powers on

Eh, eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh, eh
I take em off, turn em off,
I take em off, turn em off
I take em off, turn em off,
I take em off, turn em off

Eh, eh, eh, eh
