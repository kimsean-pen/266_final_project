Baby, I'd be scared if I were you
You know they got your number on the wall
Everybody's waiting for your move
And it's a long way down
They're creeping in the margins of your paper
And seeping in the edges of your town
No one knows what happened to the neighbors
And it's a long way down

But don't let them fuck with your heart
Don't let them fuck with your heart
And every time it rains I get the feeling
Got a little hole above my head
One more drop comes falling through the ceiling
And it's a long way down
So don't let them fuck with your heart
Don't let them fuck with your heart
Oh no no
Don't let them fuck with your heart
Don't let them fuck with your heart

Oh you got to be goddamn kidding me
This ain't what I need
Please just let me be (alright)
So take a little moment to remember
And build a little fort around your bed
No one's seen the likes of you before
And they're a long way down
Don't let them fuck with your heart
Oh you got to be goddamn kidding me
Goddamn kidding
Please just
Oh can you let me be?
