You hide it everytime you move
impatience waits around for me
You dance under the question mark
without even trying

I'm just not sure it's gonna work
I'm just not sure it's gonna work

You can burn it all
Rally around the table
If you want to
Just to argue all the last scenes of us
You can end it all
I'm sorry enough to tell you
That i'm okay
and I'm never going to see you again

The killer's walking amongst us
Look around, they'll find your ashes
You cradle over your mistakes
and every heart you'll never break

I'm just not sure it's gonna work
I'm just not sure it's gonna work

You can burn it all
Rally around the table
If you want to
Just to argue all the last scenes of us
You can end it all
I'm sorry enough to tell you
That i'm okay
and I'm never going to see you again

You stumble, through questions
that you could never answer
That barrel is loaded
So go and Paint Your Target

So and again you stomp around
With beautiful faults
