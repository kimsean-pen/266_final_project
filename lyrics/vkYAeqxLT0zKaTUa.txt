The bell rings and all things
Are calling the days past
The play's cast
Remember september
When we were together
Together, together

Schooldays, the happy days when we were going nowhere
Schooldays, the happy time when we were feeling no care

Schooldays when three said that we'd better be friends forever
How long is ever? Isn't it strange?
Schooldays together, why do they change?
How long is ever? Isn't it strange?

Did kites fly and I spy
And you cry to run fast
Or come last
You know how we made vows
They're gone now
We made friends we broke friends
No more friends

Schooldays, the happy days when we were going nowhere
Schooldays, the happy time when we were feeling no care

How long is ever? Isn't it strange?
Schooldays together, why do they change?
How long is ever? Isn't it strange?
Schooldays together, why do they change?
How long is ever? Isn't it strange?
Schooldays together, why do they change?
How long is ever? Isn't it strange?
Schooldays together, why do they change?
How long is ever? Isn't it strange?
Schooldays together, why do they change?

Remember
Remember when we
Together
Went to the sea

Seagull's scream and pink ice cream
And the deep blue sky and the waves seem high
And golden sand and the town brass band play on

Wait for me
Wait for us always
Wait for me
Wait for us to come

Mister Watson wants to see you in the master's room
It's about the work you should have don
And I think you must go now

Re... mem... ber...
Gone
Gone
Gone

How long is ever? Isn't it strange?
Schooldays together, why do they change?
How long is ever? Isn't it strange?
Schooldays together, why do they change?
How long is ever? Isn't it strange?
Schooldays together, why do they change?
How long is ever? Isn't it strange?
Schooldays together, why do they change?
