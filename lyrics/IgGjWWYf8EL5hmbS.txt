Spray perfume on your pillow when I'm out of town
And you'll leave love letters in cursive all around the house
No need to eat in, 'cause you're taking me out
When you get me flowers
You rip them right out from the ground

And everyone wants somebody who looks at them like that
Like the way you're looking at me
And everyone wants somebody who never hurts them back
Unless I want to fight, baby

You're so freaking cute
I think I could get used to you
Got me like aww, aww (aww), aww, aww (aww)
And where did you come from babe?
Please don't tell me you're fa-a-ake, no
Got me like aww, aww (aww), aww, aww

When I get too crazy, drive me down the cove
(Drive me down, yeah)
Play kiss marry kill 'bout the people we know
No matter how reckless, you never say no
I'll never let nobody ever this close

And everyone wants somebody who looks at them like that
Like the way you're looking at me
And everyone wants somebody who never hurts them back
Unless I want to fight, baby

You're so freaking cute
I think I could get used to you
Got me like aww, aww (aww), aww, aww (aww)
And where did you come from babe?
Please don't tell me you're fa-a-ake, no
Got me like aww, aww (aww), aww, aww
