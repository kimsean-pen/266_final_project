Well I'm searchin' for this feelin'
That's crawlin' in my veins
I'm on the inside, i wanna get out
Oh I need that cure, there ain't no doubt

Oh, well it feels so good
Up and down and in and out, let's make this understood
Oh, 'cause I'm comin' on for you now

I got that wicked sensation
That's crawlin' all over me
I got that wicked sensation
You know that's all I ever need
When I get down on my knees
Gotta give in, gotta put it out

Well there's no reason
For the way you make me feel
It must be pure desire
But my soul, you know it's burnin' like a flame
My heart just fills with fire

Oh, well it feels so good, up and down and in and out
Let's make this understood
Oh, 'cause I'm comin' on for you now

I got that wicked sensation
That's crawlin' in my veins
I got that wicked sensation
You know that's all i ever need
When I get down on my knees

Gotta give in, gotta put it out, oh shake my soul

Oh, well it feels so good
Up and down and in and out
Let's make this understood
'Cause I'm comin' on for you now

I got that wicked sensation
That's crawlin' all over me
I got that wicked sensation
You know that's all I ever need
When I get down on my knees
I got that wicked sensation
Wicked, wicked, wicked

How you shake this poor boy's soul, oh, how you shake it girl
How you do me in, how you do me in, oh, it's my soul, oh, it's my soul
It burns, it burns it yearns, it's gotta come out, it's gotta come out
Come out, come out, come out, come out, come out
Oh you know that devil's in my soul, well
