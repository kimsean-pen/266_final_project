A fish was made to swim in the ocean
A boat was made to sale on the sea
As sure as there are stars above
I know I know you were made for me
You were made for me

A grape was made to grow on a vine
An apple was made to grow on a tree
As sure as there are stars above
I know, I know you were made for me

We'll have our quarrels and you'll upset me
But what can I do?
You've been mine ever since I met you and I'll never leave you
No, I'll never leave you

As sure as there's a heaven up above me
From you I know I'll never be free
As sure as there are stars above
I know, I know you were made for me

A fish was made to swim in the ocean
A boat was made to sale on the sea
As sure as there are stars above
I know, I know you were made for me
You were made for me

A grape was made to grow on a vine
An apple, an apple was made to grow on a tree
As sure as there are stars above
I know, I know you were made for me

We'll have our quarrels and you'll upset me
But what can I do?
You've been mine ever since I met you and I'll never, never, never, never, never,
never leave you

As sure as there's a heaven up above me
From you I know I'll never be free
As sure as there are stars above
I know, I know you were made for me
