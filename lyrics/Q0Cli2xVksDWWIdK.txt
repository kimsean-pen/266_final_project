Hold me like you mean it
Tonight I need to feel your skin on my skin
Often I forget you're this being
I get lost alone online, stalking humanity

The world is collapsing
The world is indifferent

Can you feel it
The communication
Inside this room?
We are infinite

So let the hurricane come blow me down
Down to the mountain where I will scream to be found
The sky has opened up and now I'm overcome
With all the information, the universe, the atom

The world is collapsing
The world is indifferent

Can you feel it
The communication
Inside this room?
We are infinite
Can you feel it...
