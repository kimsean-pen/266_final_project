"So apropos:
Saw death on a sunny snow"
"For every life..."
"forego the parable."
"Seek the light."
"...my knees are cold."

Running home
Running home
"Go find another lover
To bring a..., to string along!"
"With all your lies
You're still very lovable."
"I toured the light
So many foreign roads
For Emma, forever ago."
