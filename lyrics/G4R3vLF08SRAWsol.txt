I've been to hell and back
But the only thing that's true to me is
I am lost inside a wasteland
I am lost inside my head again
Can't see the end
I bite my tongue to hide the shame
It's the only thing that makes it seem like everything's okay

I'm blinded by the chemical trails
A smile everyone knew was forgotten
No, it can't be
I won't waste away
Familiar faces and sounds won't end me

This ship is going down, break me
Lost sea, drowning in my mind
I cannot define the state of my mind
This situation's gotta go
Static growing
I'm wasted
Black noise
Abnormality
A dissonant lie
How can I fight this on my own?

I'm calling a savior
Familiar path on my end
Not sorry to say this
This lie has gone on so far

I'm blinded by the chemical trails
A smile everyone knew was forgotten
No, it cant be
I won't waste away
Familiar faces and sounds won't end me

I'm not alright, I can't say it enough
A thousand miles left
Running
It's happening again
Late nights up, and I'm out of it

I'll be alright, oh it'll be just fine
(I'm screaming for the blinded)
I'll be alright, oh it'll be just fine
(I promise)

I'll be alright, oh it'll be just fine
(I'm not alright, I can't say it enough)
I'm screaming for the blinded
(A thousand miles left, running)
I'll be alright, oh it'll be just fine
(It's happening again)
I promise
(It's happening again)
