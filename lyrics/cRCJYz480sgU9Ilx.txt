Yeah, yeah
All night long, you've been looking at me
Well, you know you're the dance hall cutie that you longed to be
Oh well now, you've been laying it down
You've got your hip swinging out of bounds
And I like the way you do what you're doin' to me

Alright, that's right, that's right, that's right
That's right I really love your tiger light
That's neat, that's neat, that's neat, that's neat
I really love your tiger feet, I really love your tiger feet
Your tiger feet
Your tiger feet
Your tiger feet
Well, alright
Well, flash your warning lights just as long as you like
I know you're aching to be making me tonight
I've got a feeling in my knees
It's a feeling only you can please
There ain't no way I'm gonna let you outta my sight
Alright, that's right, that's right, that's right

That's right I really love your tiger light

That's neat, that's neat, that's neat, that's neat
I really love your tiger feet, I really love your tiger feet
Your tiger feet
Your tiger feet

Your tiger feet
Well, alright

Alright, that's right, that's right, that's right
That's right I really love your tiger light
That's neat, that's neat, that's neat, that's neat
I really love your tiger feet, I really love your tiger feet
Your tiger feet
Your tiger feet
Your tiger feet
Well, alright
Well, now you've been laying it down
You've got your hips swinging out of bounds
And I like the way you do what you're doin' to me
Alright, that's right, that's right, that's right

That's right I really love your tiger light
That's neat, that's neat, that's neat, that's neat
I really love your tiger feet, I really love your tiger feet

Your tiger feet
Your tiger feet
Your tiger feet
Well, alright
