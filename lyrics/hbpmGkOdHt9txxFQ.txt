Today
Is the last day
That I'm using words.
They've gone out,
Lost their meaning.
Don't function anymore...

Let's
Let's
Let's get unconscious honey...
Let's get unconscious honey...

Today is the last day
That I'm using words.
They've gone out,
Lost their meaning.
Don't function anymore...

Traveling,
Leaving logic and reason
Traveling,
To the arms of unconsciousness
Traveling,
Leaving logic and reason
Traveling,
To the arms of unconsciousness

Let's get unconscious honey,
Let's get unconscious,
Let's get unconscious honey,
Let's get unconscious...

Words are useless, especially sentences
They don't stand for anything!
How could they explain how I feel?

Traveling, traveling
I'm traveling
Traveling, traveling
Leaving logic and reason
Traveling, traveling
I'm gonna relax
Traveling, traveling
In the arms of unconsciousness...

Let's get unconscious honey,
Let's get unconscious...
Let's get unconscious honey,
Let's get unconscious...
...

And inside,
We're all still wet
Longing and yearning
How can I explain how I feel?

Let's get unconscious honey,
Let's get unconscious
Let's get unconscious honey,
Let's get unconscious
...

Traveling, traveling...
Traveling, traveling...
Traveling, traveling...
Traveling, traveling...
In the arms of unconsciousness

And all that you have ever learned,
Try to forget.
I'll never explain again.
