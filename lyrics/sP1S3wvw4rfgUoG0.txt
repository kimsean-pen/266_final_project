I saw you gather all your hope with all your dreams
I waved just like a shooting star that once I waved to me
I am a lover in mid-air
I think it about it; I don't care
Into the fire of despair
Just like a train that goes nowhere

But you can rain on me
Yeah you can rain rain on me

There was a time I got it wrong
It shakes my memory
And all the time I had it all
Its just I couldn't see
I am a robber in the dark
Singing about a broken heart
Answering whistles in the air
Waiting for someone else to care

But you can rain on me
Yeah you can rain on me
Yeah you can rain on me
Yeah you can rain on me

When the rain came tumbling down
And both your feet were on the ground oh
Running fast and free oh yeah
Well maybe time gonna wear you out
or maybe you're gonna come around or
we'll just wait and see oh yeah

But you can rain on me
Yeah you can rain on me
But you can rain on me
Yeah you can rain rain on me

Yeah you can rain on me
But you can rain...
