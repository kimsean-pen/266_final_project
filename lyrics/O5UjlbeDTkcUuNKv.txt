It's your birthday and I'm thirsty
And I, and I,, and I
It's your birthday and I'm thirsty
And I, and I,, and I

I'm sleeping up on you, yeah
I was selling drugs and playing by the rules, yeah
And those blood stain sheets
And those Madlib beats
And that gold in your teeth
I'm a motherfucker
Run a train, get a train

Waking up, panties off
Sleeping 'till your phone rings
And that brain got me weak
Oh that girl, oh she speak
Got that grass, you're green
You a mean nigga

It's your birthday and I'm thirsty
And I, and I, and I, and I
It's your birthday and I'm thirsty
And I, and I, and I, and I

Girl it's your world
The planets ring up
And ooo, it must be you birthday
The earth keeps spinning your tune
Girl it's your world
The evening stars fall from you
And that's you birthplace
The sun reminds me of you

I was skipping up on school, yeah
I was running with the gang
We was fools, yeah
And that goose got me weak
And that hole in your teeth
And that kid in the street

And tonight imma ball
When I fight catch a hood
Catch a flight
Catch her left

Catch these hands, yeah you might
And you know what I like

I was born up the summer too
Something I was missing like virtuose
And I'm early, it's my birthday
And you looking kinda curvy
And your titties kinda perky
I'm a savage when I'm dirty
And I'm causing controversy
I don't care, I got attorney
All this slopey on my jersey
Got me diddy Lord help me
Yeah yeah, Lord help me

Girl it's your world
The planets ring up
And ooo, it must be you birthday
The earth keeps spinning your tune
Girl it's your world
The evening stars fall from you
And that's you birthplace
The sun reminds me of you

Girl it's your world
The planets ring up
And ooo, it must be you birthday
The earth keeps spinning your tune
Girl it's your world
The evening stars fall from you
And that's you birthplace
The sun reminds me of you
