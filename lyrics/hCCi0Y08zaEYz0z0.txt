Ain't no telling where he goes
Out through a hole in his mind, I suppose
Forgets to hold that pretty girl close
Forgets he is a friend of mine
Never does call his mama and them
Never does make any holiday plans
Takes a road no one's ever been
Ends up where it wants

He's gone out into
The wild blue wind
Crazy again
He's gone out into
The wild blue wind
Crazy again

Seen him down there on 21st and Rose
Trying to keep the wind from the seams of his clothes
I wouldn't say it's the life he chose
But man, it's got a hold of him
Waitin' on the corner for his next big break
Cussin' all the drugs they can't make him take
He asks me if he's gonna be okay
I say, "Sure," but I can't say when

He's gone out into
The wild blue wind
Crazy again
He's gone out into
The wild blue wind
Crazy again

Remember back when the dream was alive
Thought he stood a chance of turnin' right
There was little brown babies ridin' little red bikes
You and him were holding hands
Now he don't pick up 'cause they got in his phone
He's terrified of bein' alone
Used to have faith on a long thin rope
Now it seems you're gettin' towards the end

He's gone out into
The wild blue wind
Crazy again
He's gone out into
The wild blue wind
Crazy again
He's gone out into
The wild blue wind
Crazy again
He's gone out into
The wild blue wind
Crazy again
