You should've got a better bed
Better for your head
Better heads need shut eye

You should've got a better bed
Better for your head
Better heads need shut eye
You should've got out of the red
In the red you're better off dead
Deader than the red dead sea
Promise it to me
Promise me the sea

You should've got a better bed
Better for your head
Better heads need shut eye
You should've got out of the red

In the red you're better off dead
Deader than the red dead sea
Promise it to me
Promise me the sea
People all the people with big bellies banging bigger drums
They beat down on you they beat the pulse into your shoes

Shoes that are made for walking you to lands and other seas
See those seas of see those seas that you've seen on the big screen

You should've got a better bed
Better for your head
Better heads need shut eye
You should've got out of the red
In the red you're better off dead
Deader than the red dead sea

Promise it to me
Promise me the sea
Sad hello's and mad high lows
Now i know not nobody knows

Sad hello's and mad high lows
Now i know not nobody knows
Where do we go?
Oh where do we go?

People all the people with big bellies banging bigger drums
They beat down on you they beat the pulse into your shoes
Shoes that are made for walking you to lands and other seas
See those seas of see those seas that you've seen on the big screen
People all the people with big bellies banging bigger drums
They beat down on you they beat the pulse into your shoes
Shoes that are made for walking you to lands and other seas
See those seas of see those seas that you've seen on the big screen
