There's an aching, complicating, conversation
Between two souls
If it's a game then play it safe, no misbehaving
Let's go slow

I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you)
But there's way too much to do
(But there's way too much to do)
Maybe we can stay in the house, we can lay out, order take out

I can be
Your lazy love
Your lazy love
Your lazy love
If you're holding me
You don't have to say too much
You don't have to say too much
I just want your lazy love

Monday morning, rain is pouring, let's be boring
We don't move
Stop the clock, I tic, you toc, the world it knocks
But we sleep through

I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you)
But there's way too much to do
(But there's way too much to do)
Maybe we can stay in the house, we can lay out, order take out

I can be
Your lazy love
Your lazy love
Your lazy love

If you're holding me
You don't have to say too much
You don't have to say too much
I just want your lazy love

Lazy love
My lazy love
My lazy love
My lazy love
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Lazy love
My lazy love
My lazy love
Woah, oh, oh, oh...
Lazy, lazy, oh, your lazy love
