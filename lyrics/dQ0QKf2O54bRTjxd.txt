I been doin' this shit
(Yeah let's go)

Tranquilizers got me tranq, fill the blank
Actually I fill the bank, how you feel about that?
Naturally I'm comin' back, cut the crap
I've been cutting up the check, hundred bands
Hundred bands, hundred bands
I've been cuttin' up the check, hundred bands
Gotta pay me in advance, hundred bands
Hundred bands, ay, hundred bands

On to the next
I've been up since 1 AM
Big checks
Where's the rest?
Ecco countin' up for me, it's really crazy
I'm with Thaiboy in the Lex (Thaiboy)
What the fuck, I thought you didn't wanna be around us
We live and direct
Comin' at you, Trash Island, yeah we goin' crazy
They didn't wanna see me win
Trash Island, yeah we goin' crazy
Fucked it, fucked it up, I was close to being fed up with this shit
Trash Star, yeah I'm feelin' better about this shit
Drain life, baby let me tell you about this shit
Crushed up, I thought it was hard, it's really easy
What's up, put a trademark on the night
94, not five
They gon' do it all for D9
Live and die by this shit, D9
D9, D9
Trash Island, yeah we goin' crazy
(We're gonna do it all for D9)
