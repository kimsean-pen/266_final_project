This abysmal world
Brings tears to my eyes
And a fiery rage
Deep inside

The irony
In love is itself
There is no comfort

Give me my warmth
Where is my mother?
Give me my comfort
Where is my mother?

Stagnation
A welcome haunt
For us all

My heart beats
Without pride
How can this be?
I'm still a child

Give me my warmth
Where is my mother?
Give me my comfort
Where is my mother?

Where is my
Where is my
Where is my
Where is my
Where is my mother?

Bury me across the ocean
Spread my ashes into the sea
Bury me across the ocean
Spread my ashes into the sea

Bury me
