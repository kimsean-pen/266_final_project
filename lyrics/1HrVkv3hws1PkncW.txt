Drunk in my room, alone again
For the second night this week I call my friends
Ask if they could come over
But they've got plans
They try to invite me
But it's not that exciting
Plus this bottle's in my hand
So I just let 'em go
Why can't I let it go?
Fuck it I'm letting go
You, can you hear me?
(I don't think they know)
Go numb and lose the feeling
Fucked up, I'm letting go
I don't think that I have the will power
To do deal with my own life
When everything is going sour
Only getting out
To go to work or liquor stores
I can't take this spout
So I destroy my liver more
Fuck this, just let it go
Drunk in my room, alone again
For the third night this week
Call my friends, they don't care
Drunk in my room, alone again
For the fourth night this week
Call my friends, they don't care
Fuck it, I'm letting go
Fuck it, I'm letting go
Fuck this, I'm letting go
