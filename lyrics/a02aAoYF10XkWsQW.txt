Go!

Manic, I'm erratic, yes it's true
Panic like an addict for abuse
Panic like an addict, I'm confused
I need to feel you
Pressure coming, pressure down below
Forever you never let me go
Pressure coming, feel like I could choke
Can't live without you

Break me I need to feel ya
Take me I need to feel ya
Save me I need to feel ya
I need to feel you

This is how you dominate
Every part of me
Yeah it's okay, dominate me
Teach me not to misbehave
I can be your slave
Yeah it's okay, dominate me
It's okay
Dominate me
It's okay
Dominate me
Yeah it's okay, dominate
Go!

Pressure coming You make, make me right
You are something I can't, can't deny
Gimme more, 'cause I won't be denied
You make me alive
Master are and Master you will be
Your commands are master over me
I can't move, I can't even breathe
Give me what I need

Break me I need to feel you
Take me I need to feel you
Save me I need to feel you
I need to feel you

This is how you dominate
Every part of me
Yeah it's okay, dominate me
Teach me not to misbehave
I can be your slave
Yeah it's okay, dominate me
It's okay
Dominate me
It's okay
Dominate me

You're the one I need to break me
You're the one I need to take me
You're the one I need to save me
You're the one I need to break me
You're the one I need to take me
You're the one I need to save me

Break me I need to feel ya
Take me I need to feel ya
Save me I need to feel ya
I need to feel you

This is how you dominate
Every part of me
Yeah it's okay, dominate me
Teach me not to misbehave
I can be your slave
Yeah it's okay, dominate me
It's okay
Dominate me
It's okay
Dominate me
Yeah it's okay, dominate
Go!
