Can we please, turn on a movie?
I need something distracting from what's really happening
To us, because I can't handle this.
I can't listen to another minute of the words I'm collecting.

There's a difference between
What I want and what I need
Will I figure this out?

Because now I feel so scared,
So disconnected from the world that I'm live in.
Constant signals indicating I am nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing!

Can we please turn on a movie?
I need something to distract me.
Can we please turn on a movie?
I need something (I need something).

There is a difference between
What I want and what I need.

I am a poet
Walking quiet
Like a ghost
In an abandoned apartment.
Staying silent
Feeling so dishonest selling work from an office to an auction.
I am a tasteless poet with everything to lose.

There is a difference between...
