This time I'm burning up the airwaves,
Long distance signal, can you hear me?
No one will stop me here tonight.
I, I know that it can hurt sometimes.
I watched you standing at the back gate,
Dressed up and talking to a new face.
You don't know why you can't sleep at night,
Get off this roller coaster ride.

But you want me here, your heart is clearly reeling,
And as the end draws near, will you come back to me?

If I could just get by, just for one more night,
I would fight to set you free,
And when you lost all hope,
You may never know just how great your life could be,
But I'm lost in the moment,
Please tell me how I can't find the reasons,
To say what I'll say,
My life was complete when I found you.

Woah-oh-oh-oh, la-da-da-da-da
Woah-oh-oh-oh,

That night, the lights were shining all wrong.
Two hearts, a perfect little love song,
Do you still think of me?
My heart won't let me be,

If I could just get by, just for one more night,
I would fight to set you free,
And when you lost all hope,
You may never know just how great your life could be,
But I'm lost in the moment,
Please tell me how I can't find the reasons,
To say what I'll say,
My life was complete when I found you.

So tell me how to deal without her,
I've been searching up and down this coast,
I've learned enough to sing forever,
But I still miss you coming home,
So help me understand your reasons,
Sing something I refuse to lose,
I've been trapped inside a world that's spinning,
On a course that's set for two,

Uh-oh, uh oh.
If this were heaven, then I'd die for you.
Uh-oh, uh oh.

If I could just get by, just for one more night,
I would fight to set you free,
And when you lost all hope,
You may never know just how great your life could be,
But I'm lost in the moment,
Please tell me how I can't find the reasons,
To say what I'll say,
My life was complete when I found you.

Woah-oh-oh-oh, la-da-da-da-da
Woah-oh-oh-oh, (When I found you)
la-da-da-da-da
Woah-oh-oh-oh, la-da-da-da-da
Woah-oh-oh-oh,
When I found you.
