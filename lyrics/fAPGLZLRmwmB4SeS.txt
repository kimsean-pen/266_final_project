Black is the night, Metal we fight
Power amps set to explode
Energy screams, magic and dreams
Satan records their first note

We chime the bell, chaos and Hell
Metal for maniacs pure
Faster than steel, fortune on wheels
Brain hemorrhage is the cure

For Black Metal
Black Metal
Black Metal
Black Metal
Black Metal

Lay down your souls to the gods Rock 'n' Roll

Freaking so wild, nobody's mild
Giving it all that you got
Wild is so right, Metal tonight
Faster than over the top

Open the door, enter Hell's core
Black is the code for tonight
Atomic force, feel no remorse
Crank up the amps, now it's night

Black Metal
Black Metal

Black Metal

Lay down your souls to the gods Rock 'n' Roll
Metal tenfold through the deadly black hole
Riding Hell's stallions bareback and free
Taking our chances with raw energy

Come ride the night with us, rock hard and fight
United my legions we stand
Freak hard and wild for us, give up your souls
Live for the quest Satan's band

Let's go!

Against these odds, Black Metal gods
Fight to achieve our goal
Casting a spell, leather and Hell
Black Metal gods, Rock 'n' Roll

Building up steam, nuclear screams
War-heads are ready to fight
Black leather hounds, faster than sound
Metal, our purpose in life

Black Metal

Lay down your souls to the gods Rock 'n' Roll
