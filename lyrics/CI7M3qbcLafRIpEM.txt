There's smell of fresh cut grass

and it's filling up my senses

And the sun is shining down on the blossoms in the avenue.
There's a buzzing fly hanging
around the bluebells and the daisies

And there's a lot more loving left in this world.

Don't go
don't leave me now
now
now

While the sun smiles
stick around and laugh a while
yeah.

And I lie on warm and soft sandy beaches

And my toes are submerged in the water
and it feels good.
Children playing, building castles on the shoreline
Like a painted little love, and Lord
it feels so fine.

Don't go
don't leave me now
now
now
. .

There's white horses and they're coming at me
and they face now

And there's a blue sirocco blowing warm into my face.
The sun is shining on the other side of the bridges

The cars going by with smiles in the windows.
There's a black cat Iying in the shadow of the gate-post

And the black cat keeps telling me that love is on it's way.
Yeah
there's a black cat Iying in the shadow of the gate-post

And the black cat tells me that love is on it's way.

Don't go
don'f ieave me now
now
now
. . .
Stick around and laugh a while. - Don't go! -
Don't go
don't leave me now
now
now
. . .
Don't go
don't leave me now
now
now
. . .
Don't go
I can hear you coming now
now
now
Ah
no no no
don't go!
