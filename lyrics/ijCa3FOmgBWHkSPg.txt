It's just you and me baby
We're trapped in two different worlds
Now I know you're no downtown boy, well I'm no uptown girl neither
We're trapped between two realms you see
You wanna talk to me
Well then drop the phone
And pick up the board

I'll be your Carol Anne
I'll be your pentagram
Let's dabble in the black arts
This is not a game
Let me spell my name
Let's keep this in the dark

A-B-C-D-E-F-G
Call me on the Ouija Board
H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P
Call me on the Ouija Board
Q-R-S-T-U and I
Call me on the Ouija Board
W-X-Y-and-Z
Call me on the Ouija Board
On the Ouija Board

Place your fingers on the board
And tell me what you'll do to me
I will spell a fantasy
And cast a spell of ecstasy.
A little touch of magic
In this world obsessed with science

I'll be your Carol Anne
I'll be your pentagram
Let's dabble in the black arts
This is not a game
Let me spell my name
Let's keep this in the dark

A-B-C-D-E-F-G
Call me on the Ouija Board
H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P
Call me on the Ouija Board
Q-R-S-T-U and I
Call me on the Ouija Board
W-X-Y-and-Z
Call me on the Ouija Board
On the Ouija Board

Maybe yes and maybe no
We don't need no telephone
Maybe yes and maybe no
Let's see where this goes
Maybe yes and maybe no
We don't need no telephone
Maybe yes and maybe no
Let's see where this goes

A-B-C-D-E-F-G
Call me on the Ouija Board
H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P
Call me on the Ouija Board
Q-R-S-T-U and I
Call me on the Ouija Board
W-X-Y-and-Z
Call me on the Ouija Board
On the Ouija Board
Goodbye
G-g-g-g-goodbye
Goodbye
