this is the way
the way it has to be
this is the way
the way we all will go

slaving away for a bit of peace
watching our money as it rolls on in

time will get you in the end
and take away the things
the things you thought you had
time will take away your friends
and leave you all alone
alone until the end

this is the way
the way it has to be
and this is the way
the way we all will go
