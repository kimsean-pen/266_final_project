I'm wearing thin
Wearing out, becoming weak
Holding hands with this rope
She's my self-destructive
Bleeding disease
The thing that makes it hard to breathe
But if I shoved you far away
This addict just starved again asphyxiated

And now I see it's you that's tearing me (ensnaring me)
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out, now set me free

Lynched high above what used to be
In her gallows built for me
So I escaped, cut this noose around my...
Neck, I break free to see the things you blinded me
And I shoved you far away
Now I live the life I dreamed of, you're dead to me

And now I see it's you that's tearing me (ensnaring me)
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out, now set me free
And now I see it's you that's tearing me (ensnaring me)
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out, now set me free

You poisoned my life
So I take this knife
And I cut you out
Cut you out

And now I see it's you that's tearing me (ensnaring me)
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out, now set me free
And now I see it's you that's tearing me (ensnaring me)
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out, now set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
