If only he would notice me in the daytime When the
lights go down, conversation dies out Did you notice?
It can't all be how you perceive Innocently living
Why can't you see it's not you, it's me" is the strife?
Tenaciously uptight Conversation dies out as the lights go down I
really hate it when the silence starts to set And everythingwe say is
so introductory Exchanging words that both of us will soon forget
Just wait until you're older It's time
that you know If only he could only see
That life's dissolving It's not too
soon to be with you Did you know that?
On the Beltline, in the daytime Conversation dies out as the lights
go I really hate it when the silence starts to set And everything we
say is so introductory Exchanging words that both of us will
soon forget Just wait until you're older You're losing control
