You woke to find your memories scattered all along the blood soaked floor
Something happened while you slept, you raised the demons and you wept
As you lost control, they lost control of you

You woke to find it desolate, you woke to find it desolate
So you searched for your entire life, you pray to see, you pray to see

The one you loved returning, the one you left to die
You'll never stop, you're searching for the one you know has died

You woke to find your memories
Scattered all along the blood soaked floor
Scattered all along the blood soaked floor

So you searched for your entire life, you pray to see, you pray to see

The one you loved returning, the one you left to die
You never stop, you're searching for the one you know has died

You'll never stop, you're searching for the one you know has died

Is the one you loved returning? The one you left to die
