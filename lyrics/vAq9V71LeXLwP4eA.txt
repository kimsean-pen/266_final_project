Took me to the edge and you made me listen
Said your heart is cement
And it's time for our seperate ways
I asked what you meant and you turned in pity
Drank the view out west
Like you had nothing more to say
I am suffocating up here, oh the air is so thin
Don't you dare tell me that you never felt anything

Every shaky breath so close,
Every touch of mine you stole,
You cast it out,
And now my heart is cement

Every secret that you know,
Every time you took your toll,
You pushed me out,
And now my heart is cement

You made me chalk and clay and sand
Packed me in so tight
So much more than I could stand
Tryna be as warm-blooded as I can
Was it all too much?
My heart was soft to touch

Every shaky breath so close,
Every touch of mine you stole,
You cast it out,
And now my heart is cement

Every secret that you know,
Every time you took your toll,
You pushed me out,
And now my heart is cement

So heavy heavy when you filled me in, yeah
I sunk like a stone in the deep end
Don't you dare tell me that you never felt anything

Every shaky breath so close,
Every touch of mine you stole,
You cast it out,
And now my heart is cement

Every secret that you know,
Every time you took your toll,
You pushed me out,
And now my heart is cement
