You're here again
Before my eyes
A ghost within a dream
Things that you do and say
Just kill me every time
Is this how, how it will stay

By the river I walk and wander on
I'm a warrior on a journey home
Will you show me the way to you once more
Always yours, ghost in the rain

I wish I could undo
My great mistake
And say the words unsaid
Obsession grows like flames
Time only makes it worse
It hurts yet I'll be strong

By the river I walk and wander on
I'm a warrior dreaming of lost love
Will you open the door to me once more
Always yours, ghost in the rain

The wind will bring a gentle storm
Under the pain for more
Facing my destiny
A neverending story
Survivor is coming home

By the river I walk and wander on
I'm a warrior on a journey home
Will you show me the way to you once more
Always yours, ghost in the rain

By the river I walk and wander on
I'm a warrior dreaming of lost love
Will you open the door to me once more
Always yours, ghost in the rain

In the rain
Like a ghost in the rain
I call your name
