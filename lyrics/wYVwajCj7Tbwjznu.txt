Once upon time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone,
You found me
You found me
You found me

I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me
Without me
Without me

And she's long gone
When she's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on a cold hard ground
Oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies

She'll never see you cry
Pretend she doesn't know
That she's the reason why
You're drowning
You're drowning
You're drowning

And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt
Is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see
She was long gone
When she met me
And I realize the joke is on me
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now

Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

When your saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or him or anyone or anything

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
