All I ever wanted was a shot at breakin' the rules

I wanna make a lot of money
But I don't wanna go to school
I don't wanna get a real job
I don't wanna be you

I'd rather be dead
Yeah, I'd rather be dead
I'd rather be face down in the dirt with a bullet in my head

I met a man from mars and a couple other freaks that night

I wanna take on the world
I wanna bang a million girls
I don't wanna wear a 3-piece suit
I don't wanna be you

I'd rather be dead
Yeah, I'd rather be dead
I'd rather be face down in the dirt with a bullet in my head

I'd rather be dead

Yeah, I'd rather be dead
I'd rather be face down in the dirt with a bullet in my head

Yeah, I'd rather be dead, I'd rather be dead
Yeah I'd rather be dead
Yeah, I'd rather be dead
I'd rather be face down in the dirt with a bullet in my head

I'd rather be dead
Yeah, I'd rather be dead
I'd rather be face down in the dirt with a bullet in my head
With a bullet in my head
