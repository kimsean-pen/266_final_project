Will you end my pain?
Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out?
Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart
While I'm going

Will you end my pain?
Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out?
Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart
While I'm going insane

Can you break my bones?
Will you tear my skin?
Can you taste my lust?
Can you feel my sin?
See, I'm a waste of life, I should just kill myself
Yeah, I could slit my wrists, but it really wouldn't help
Wouldn't fix my issues, or change your mind
'Cause I broke your heart and you buried mine
Now, I'm six feet deep and I can't breathe
I got dirt in my eyes and blood on my sleeves
But I dig my way up through these roots and leaves
So I can get some air, so I can finally breathe
And now I'm on my knees, oh baby, begging please
Will you
Will you

Will you end my pain?
Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out?
Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart
While I'm going

Will you end my pain?
Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out?
Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart
While I'm going insane

Don't you miss me when I'm gone
'Cause you're the fucking reason that I'm not around
Don't you miss me when I'm, miss me when I'm gone
'Cause you're the fucking reason that I'm not around
Fucking reason that I'm not around
Bitch, you're the fucking reason that I'm not around
