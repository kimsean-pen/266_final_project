If I die before I get it done will you decide
Take my words and turn them into signs that will survive
Because a long time ago I knew not to deprive
It's safe out there and now you're everywhere just like the skies

You are love you are the love supreme you are the rise
And when you hear this you'll know it's your jam, it's your goodbye
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone and when the drummer drums

He's going to play my song to carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away to where we all belong

We all crossed when we were feeling lost
It's just the tide
Katari cried the day her lover died she recognized
Because he gave her a life of real love it's no surprise

The nights are long but the years ate short
When you're alive
Way back when would never be again
It was a time

It's gonna catch you so glad I met you
To walk the line like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums he's going to play my song to carry me along

Let me live, so when it's time to die
Even the reaper cries
Let me die, so when it's time to live another son will rise...

I said Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I said Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away to where we all belong

Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
Like I said you know I'm almost dead

You know I'm almost gone
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone.
