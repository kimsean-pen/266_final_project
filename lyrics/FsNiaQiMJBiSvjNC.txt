Move one inch at a time
And don't make shit rhyme
Would it be too easy to repeat the first line?
My minds not a well, it wont run dry
Just keep drinking water and you'll be alright
This is paralysis
With no time at all to let go

Well don't call me by my full name
All this is temporary
It feels much better to know that you wont feel a thing
Well don't talk about it
Write it down but don't ask for help
Well I can't be honest with even myself
Did you ever wish you were somebody else?

Accomplishments are transient
They pulled me in unremittingly
Just lasting this long I feel relived to let repetition save me

Well don't call me by my full name
All this is temporary
It feels much better to know that you wont feel a thing
Well don't talk about it
Write it down but don't ask for help
I can't be honest with even myself
Did you ever wish you were somebody else?

Move one inch at a time
And you'll be just fine
Move one inch at a time
And you'll find
They pulled me in but accomplishments are transient
They pulled me in but accomplishments are transient

Well don't call me by my full name
All this is temporary
It feels much better to know that you wont feel a thing
Well don't talk about it
Write it down but don't ask for help
I can't be honest with even myself
Did you ever wish you were
Did you ever wish you were
Did you ever wish you were somebody else?
