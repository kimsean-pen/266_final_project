Oh the werewolf, the werewolf
Comes stepping along
He don't even break the branches where he's gone
Once I saw him in the moonlight, when the bats were flying
I saw the werewolf, and the werewolf was crying
How nobody knows, nobody knows
How I loved the man, as I teared off his clothes.
How nobody knows, nobody knows my pain
When I see that it's risen; that full moon again
For the werewolf, the werewolf has seen apathy
For the werewolf, somebody like you and me.
And only he goes to me, man this little flute I play.
All through the night,
until the light of day, and we are doomed to play.
For the werewolf, the werewolf, has seen apathy
For the werewolf, somebody like you and me.
