You're falling way behind
Well give it just a little bit of time
'Cause when we're all exposed
Do you want to be the first in line
Those bewitching crowds
The smoke they blow
Can make your head pop
The ego is playing its tricks on you again and again

We'll blow all our chances thinking we know
All the answers, and so it goes
With all the changes, nothing changes
No matter what you're told

So you're picking up signs
You're scared you might be losing your mind
And all the hopes of any shot you'e got
Are leaving you behind
You're making light of this I know
And its a shame
That your silly sentimental heart is to blame

We'll blow all our chances thinking we know
All the answers, and so it does
With all the changes, nothing changes
No matter what you're told

You don't want to end up in the lost and found
You better hold on tight
Odds will turn to events when you're upside down
You've got to hold on tight
I don't want to be there when you hit the ground
You need to hold on tight

We'll blow all our chances thinking we know
All the answers, and so it does
With all the changes, nothing changes
No matter what you're told
