I couldn't find out the answer in time
I want to unlock you and pursue you
(Unclear)

If the earth didn't spin (unclear) I'd find you again (unclear) and let go to free
And keep you next to me

Cause I, I thought I had nothing to lose
Running in circles for you
I thought I had nothing to lose

Cause I, I thought I had nothing to lose
Running in circles for you
If only the earth didn't spin, then where would we begin

Oh I, I thought I had nothing to lose
When I was running around in circles for you
If I (unclear), I'd keep you next to me
