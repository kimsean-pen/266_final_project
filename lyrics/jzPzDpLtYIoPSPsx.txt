In the cold and green tomorrow
Throws you into this
your archive

If your shapes could sometimes turn to
make you feel at ease
make you mine

If your shapes could sometimes turn to
make you feel at ease
make you smile

And the way you always tell her
shouldn't work inside
I know

Did you always like to dream of
things that could have been
I know I do

Do you find it hard to say words
that could have been of me
I know I do

ooo ooo ooo

hey
do you like to dream of a current
I know I do
hey
do you like to dream of a current
i know i do
