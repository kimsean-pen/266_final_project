Are you half empty?
Why don't you fill up?
There's no sense in holding onto something broken,

Did you lose something?
Or someone you love?
You've still got that story tell it every morning,

Driving down a road, down a road that's rolling
All the lovely memories you hearts been holding
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on,
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on,
Driving down a road, a road that's hidden,
All your faithful memories, your faith for living
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on,
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on,
So come on!

Nothing is perfect,
For that there's no cure,
So don't you start to bury the good with the bad, and the ugly,

Driving down a road, down a road that's rollin'
All the lovely memories you hearts been holding
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on,
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on,
Driving down a road, a road that's hidden,
All your faithful memories, your faith for living
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on,
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on,
So come on!

And I can feel your heartbeat slipping away
It's hard to catch the light when you're running from the day!
So wait for it! Wait for it! Wait!

Driving down a road, down a road that's rolling
All the lovely memories you hearts been holding
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on,
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on,
Driving down a road, a road that's hidden,
All your faithful memories, your faith for living
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on,
Nothing silhouettes till the lights come on,
So come on!
