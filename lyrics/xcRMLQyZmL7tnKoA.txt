You got diamonds in your eyes tonight
Throwing fire, trying to make it right
You're getting higher than the ceiling lights
And fall in hard enough to lose the fight

Not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
Living in the moment, paying for the kill
Golden grill of sadness, smell like wasting youth
Always ends up like this
Always gonna lose

DAZZLE me, DAZZLE me,
DAZZLE me with gold
You'll never be what
You wanna be with all that money
That money

DAZZLE me, DAZZLE me,
Throw away your gold
You'll never be what
You wanna be with all that money
That money, that money

There's a human in your hide of hearts
Hiding true colors made you fall apart
In the middle you're a work of art
But this is real life, real life

Not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
Living in the moment, paying for the kill
Golden grill of sadness, smell like wasting youth
Always ends up like this
Always gonna lose

DAZZLE me, DAZZLE me,
DAZZLE me with gold
You'll never be what
You wanna be with all that money
That money

DAZZLE me, DAZZLE me,
Throw away your gold
You'll never be what
You wanna be with all that money
That money, that money

Give me neon lights, rub me paper heights
I can feel the dive, cooling me
See the place to climb
Through my bloodshot eyes
I don't wanna the life
I'm wild of life

Not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
Living in the moment, paying for the kill
Golden grill of sadness, smell like wasting youth
Always ends up like this
Always gonna lose

DAZZLE me, DAZZLE me,
DAZZLE me with gold
You'll never be what
You wanna be with all that money
That money

DAZZLE me, DAZZLE me,
Throw away your gold
You'll never be what
You wanna be with all that money
That money, that money
