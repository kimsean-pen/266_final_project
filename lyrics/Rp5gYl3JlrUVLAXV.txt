I did it 'cause I wanna and I did it 'cause I'm gonna
And I did it just because I can
I did it 'cause it makes me feel so good
And I did it because fuck "the man"
I did it 'cause I'm crazy and no one's gonna save me
And I did it just to cut the noise
I did it 'cause I'm drunk and I did it yeah, so what?
'Cause baby you're just one of the boys

I did it all, to break every single preconceived notion that you have
I did it all to shake every single one of your emotions
And just to make you

Uncomfortable
I love to make you
Uncomfortable
I love to make you

I do it 'cause I love it and I want some more of it
And I do It 'cause you said I can't
I do it 'cause you fight it and I know don't like it
When I open up and talk about sex
I do it 'cause you hate me and I do it for the ladies
And with all my good time friends
I do it 'cause the whole damn worlds gone crazy
And fuck it man
This is the end

I did it all, to break every single preconceived notion that you have
I did it all to rape every single one of your emotions
And just to make you

Uncomfortable
I love to make you
Uncomfortable
I love to make you

Well, I don't wanna bring you down
So why you wanna bring me down?
Don't bring me down, no
Don't bring me down

I did it all to shake every single one of your emotions
And just to make you

Uncomfortable
(I love to make you)
Uncomfortable
(I love to make you)
Uncomfortable
