Never
Cover
Your heart
With shelter
Wear it in
Wear in thin
Don't be afraid to live
Makes no difference
Can you tell me why
I feel so
Numb
When you can't sleep
And you think of us
There's no relief
That's all me
Will you fake the risk
Like you always do
There's only pride left
Uncontrollable
You know it is
But it's worth the risk
I'm offering
Uncontrollable
For the sake of us
I push the brakes
I know what's next
Uncontrollable
Say it's worth the risk
But I push the brakes
I know what's next
Uncontrollable
Uncontrollable
