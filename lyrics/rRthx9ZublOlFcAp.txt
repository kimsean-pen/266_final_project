Blazing eye sees all
Nature of firey triumph
Patterns unfold
Whispers revealing
Path of spiral reaps
Fetal buried gold
Humbled in the womb
A centre opens
To the unknown

Can you feel your fate
Can you see you're
Biding time hide
From your life

Drowning in the birth
Place of the sun
Descending the path
Of an ascending god
Purify my hells to
Climb the heavens
Sacrifice the flesh
Feeding solar visions

Set your mind to soil
Set your mind to soil
In darkness
Bringing light

A knowing old
A knowing wise

Flames to blades
On earth, stabbing
Scorching sacred lust
Fall back to stone
Fall back on spear
