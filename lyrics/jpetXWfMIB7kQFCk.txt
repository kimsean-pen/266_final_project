I can't believe it
I must be dreaming
She turns the sound down
Says "I am heaving
This is a freakshow"
And I am screaming...

She spins the world round
I want to stop

Bitter sweet again
Her opening move
Down and out in black
Soft shiny and smooth
Looks like the alien crowd got groove
She burns her name into my arm
But I can never get through

To play the game
She's trying to lose
Her ultraviolet
Makes it harder to choose
Looks like the edge of the earth got moved
She blurs a way across the floor
I spin to swallow the view

And it's the same sway
Yeah it's the same slide
It's the same stare
Oh it's the same smile
Yeah it's the same but...
It's not quite right

Oh it's insane
She shakes like a freak
Stuck in the middle of the room
For a week
Looks like the only way to get on the beat
Is take her up on how to swing
But I am missing my feet

And it's the same sway
Yeah it's the same slide
It's the same swish
Oh it's the same smile
Yeah it's the same but...
It's not quite right

I'm in a step
...out!
She's two more steps
...down!
For three steps up
...clap!
And go around
...ow!
It makes my head buzz
She wants to come now
I try to stop

Always infradig
Her finishing move
Up and down in black
Soft shiny and smooth
Looks like the alien crowd got groove
She cuts a number out my arm
But I can never get through

To play this game
She's trying to lose
The stuff from mars
Makes it harder to choose
Looks like the final frontier got moved
She blurs a way across the floor
I spin to swallow the view

And it's the same sway
Yeah it's the same slide
It's the same strip
Oh it's the same smile
Yeah it's the same but
It's not quite right...

I can't believe it
I must be dreaming
She turns the lights up
Says she is leaving
This is a freakshow
And I am beaten...

She spins the world round
I have to stop
