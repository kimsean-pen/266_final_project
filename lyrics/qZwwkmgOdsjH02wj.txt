Where was I? I forgot the point that I was making.
I said if I was smart that I would save up for a piece of string and a rock to wind the string around.
Everybody wants a rock to wind a piece of string around...
Everybody wants a rock to wind a piece of string around...

Throw the crib door wide, let the people crawl inside.
Someone in this town is trying to burn the playhouse down.
They want to stop the ones who want a rock to wind a string around,
But everybody wants a rock to wind a piece of string around.

Throw the crib door wide, let the people crawl inside.
Someone in this town is trying to burn the playhouse down.
They want to stop the ones who want a rock to wind a string around,
But everybody wants a rock to wind a piece of string around.

If I were a carpenter, I'd hammer on my piglet,
I'd collect the seven dollars and I'd buy a big prosthetic forehead and wear it on my real head.
Everybody wants prosthetic foreheads on their real heads...
Everybody wants prosthetic foreheads on their real heads...

Throw the crib door wide, let the people crawl inside.
Someone in this town is trying to burn the playhouse down.
They want to stop the ones who want prosthetic foreheads on their heads,
But everybody wants prosthetic foreheads on their real heads.
