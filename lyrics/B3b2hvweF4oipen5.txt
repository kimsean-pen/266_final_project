This grave of life I give to you
Ignore what was you know it's true
Realms of fear they speak the truth
What has passed I hand to you

Bleed for me, I've bled for you
Embrace me child, I'll see you through
Bleed for me, I've bled for you
Embrace me child, I'll see you through
I'll see you

I'll dig the hole and bow my head
To see you smile, I face my death
Realms of fear they speak the truth
What has passed I hand to you

Bleed for me, I've bled for you
Embrace me child, I'll see you through
Bleed for me, I've bled for you
Embrace me child, I'll see you through
I'll see you

Bleed for me, I've bled for you
Embrace me child, I'll see you through
Bleed for me, I've bled for you
Embrace me child, I'll see you through
I'll see you
