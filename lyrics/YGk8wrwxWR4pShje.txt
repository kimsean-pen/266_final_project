Sick of having empty habits
Leading to the selfish havoc
I'm lonely in my own bones
You're unweaving where you stand
Stitch me into all your plans
Just like a cherry stone

Temporary fleeting thrills
Keep me bruised and make me ill
My skin has lavender tones
Tell me I'm a loaded gun
Tie me up and come undone

I can cover it up, I can cover it up
I can cover it up, I can cover it

I know I'm out of my depth, but I just float in it
I try to do my best, stop picking fights with it
I wanna be upset, you're not alright with it
I can cover it up, I can cover it
Try to speak my mind, wish it was by design
But I can only confess to having doubts with it
Don't wanna feel regret, I'm not alright with it
I can cover it up, I can cover it
(I can cover it up, I can cover it up)

Spending time with or without you
Cutting corners just to get
You out of my god damn mind
Keep your words up where they're brewing
I want something worth pursuing
Still letting you curl my spine

Temporary fleeting thrills
Keep me bruised and make me ill
My lonely lavender bones
Tell me how to hurt for fun
Tie me up and come undone
I can cover it up, I can cover it

I know I'm out of my depth, but I just float in it
I try to do my best, stop picking fights with it
I wanna be upset, you're not alright with it
I can cover it up, I can cover it
Try to speak my mind, wish it was by design
But I can only confess to having doubts with it
Don't wanna feel regret, I'm not alright with it
I can cover it up, I can cover it

What have I done?
Chewing on my words
Nothing's enough, I rinse myself in the dirt
Sold all my time to a plastic ecstasy
Nothing's enough

I know I'm out of my depth, but I just float in it
I try to do my best, stop picking fights with it
I wanna be upset, you're not alright with it
I can cover it up, I can cover it
Try to speak my mind, wish it was by design
But I can only confess to having doubts with it
Don't wanna feel regret
I'm not alright with it
I can cover it up, I can cover it
I can cover it up, I can cover it

I can cover it up, I can cover it up
What have I done?
I can cover it up, I can cover it
Nothing's enough
I can cover it up, I can cover it up
