Lost souls collide to find everything unsound
All that's lost, is here on the ground
I can't be found
Wanderer, I can't be found

Shrouded in secrecy; a face you can't see
I am the enigma of the everchanging
My veins, the trees, and the in between
I've come to realize that's it's all in sync

Within the deep of the night when lost souls collide
There you will find me, wandering endlessly

Night feelings, settle in
I'm falling deeper and I can't pretend
I don't know where I am anymore
And I'm closing every open door

Tear this weary mind to pieces
So drown me out, I'm filled with doubt
Maybe I'll burn, maybe I'll never learn
Disconnect, recollect

I'll disconnect
I'm feeling lost and it feels okay
Still getting darker everyday
Drown me, drown me out, drown me

Night feelings, settle in
I'm falling deeper and I'll break and bend
I am not what I was to begin
There's still so much to find in the end

Maybe there's peace in being lost
Maybe there's hurt in being home
Maybe there's hurt in being home
I can't be found
