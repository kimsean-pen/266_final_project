Driftin' like it's 1974, dressin' like the Rolling Stones
Hey, ho, let's go get some more, like young Ramones
Some nights feel like every night, this one feels brand new
Only got bad things on my mind when I'm with you
And so it goes, we found our sweet disaster

In a river of champagne
Swimmin' through the mornin' after
We float away
Dreamin' like it's 1984, dancing like the Talking Heads
Last call, 40's at the corner store, to take to bed
Tell me that you need me on the floor, passed out in your dirty clothes
Ask me what the hell I'm lookin' for like you don't know
You're makin' it so easy
To throw myself away
And so it goes, we found our sweet disaster

In a river of champagne
Swimmin' through the mornin' after
We float away
Sweet disaster
Yeah
Sweet disaster
Some nights feel like every night, this one feels brand new
Only got bad things on my mind when I'm with you
And so it goes, we found our sweet disaster

In a river of champagne
Swimmin' through the morning after
We float away
Sweet disaster
Yeah
Sweet disaster
