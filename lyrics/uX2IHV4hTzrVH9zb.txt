Turn off the lights
And touch me in the dark
Fade into the feeling
And whisper in my ear
What you want
What you need
Tell me my name
Tell me my name
Again, again, again, again
Just yell out my name, baby

(I got your nights)
I got your nights
(I got your days)
I got your days
(I got you on)
I got you on my time

(I got your nights)
I got your nights
(I got your days)
I got your days
(I got you on)
I got you on

You taste like sweet wine
And we are magnified
The sweat rolls down your thigh
We're making moves so blind
It's what you want
It's what you need
And I'm just the same, baby

(I got your nights)
I got your nights
(I got your days)
I got your days
(I got you on)
I got you on my time

(I got your nights)
I got your nights
(I got your days)
I got your days
(I got you on)
I got you on my time

And you're holding on to me like an old love
That you know every inch of
And when I feel you start to go, take it slow
'Til your body's saying more, baby

(I got your nights)
I got your nights
(I got your days)
I got your days
(I got you on)
I got you on my time

(I got your nights)
I got your nights
(I got your days)
I got your days
(I got you on)
I got you on my time

You gonna be on
My time, my time

I got your nights
(I got your days)
I got your days
(I got you on)
I got you on my time
