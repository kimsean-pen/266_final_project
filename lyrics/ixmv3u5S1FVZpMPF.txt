I'm trying not to stare
It's too late
The blankets over there
If you like
I'm broken and I'm colder than hell
I should've said I'd not
Come back here

Your breakfast will get cold
I really have to go

It's easier to lie
And be safe
Time and time again
I'm half stalled
One giant leap of faith
Is easy
When everyone you ask
Is so sure

Just give a second thought
What if we don't get caught?

Just say you love me now
And forget this whole ride
Just save your energy
For making up with me
