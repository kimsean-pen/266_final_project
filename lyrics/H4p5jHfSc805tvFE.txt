Up and died, you up and died on me
I can't believe you actually died.
I haven't cried, it hasn't rained on me
cause I can't believe you actually died.
I haven't tried cause you're not dead, you're free.
I can't believe you actually died.

and I know that you're happy there
even though I don't know where

The Other Side. The side I try to see.
I can't believe you actually died.
Your body's gone but your ghost haunts me.
I can't believe you actually died.
At your gandma's church I held a baby.
I can't believe that you actually died.
I can't believe that you made your parents cry.
I can't believe that the worms ate your eyes.
