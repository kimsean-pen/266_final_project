Relax an' settle down
Let your mind go round
Lay down on the ground
An' listen to the sound
Of the band, hold my hand

Open up your mind
We'll love right where we lie
I'll know you from inside
You're like a horse I'll ride
Over the sand, through the land

Relax and let your mind roll on
Over all your problems
Relax and let your mind roll on
Over all your problems

We try harder and harder
Tryin' to get our way
But it's a long, long wait
'Til judgment day
So settle your affairs
An' take your time
'Cause everything in the world
Is yours and mine
Yours and mine

Aaa

Relax an' settle down
Well let your mind go 'round
Lay down on the ground
And listen to the sound
Of the band, hold my hand
Relax

All with your group together
We've wrote a sound strings
