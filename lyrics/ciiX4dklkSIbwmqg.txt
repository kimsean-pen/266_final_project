All banks and tanks have lost their charm
No one grieves the thieves - No one hails the dawn
But when the sun comes back We will all be gone
A-shoveling, a-scheming - To help rebuild their walls
To make this world seem wrinkled and tired
No round fired, no assassins hired
All will salute this transformation
That will throw us back - Into a jungle of nations
All will salute the enormous bluff
That never made you blush
That never made you - Hush!
All banks and tanks have lost their glow
If you don't know now - you will never know
So fix your gaze upon the Moon - The drugs will hit soon
And go dream of the pure land - That I promised you
Go dream of the pure land - That I found for you
Lambs dressed as lions - relief in reverse
That trappings of worldly alliance
Amidst a riot of words

Nos defaites ne prouvent rien
Si ce n'est que nous etions peu nombreux
Pour lutter contre l'infamie
Et nous vous demandons que ceux
Qui nous regardent...
Que ca soit eux qui aient honte de ne rien
Avoir fait!
All banks and tanks have lost their charm
No one grieves the thieves - No one hails the dawn
But when the sun comes back We will al be gone
To help rebuild their walls
To make this world seem wrinkled and tired
No round fired, no assassins hired
All will salute this transformation
That will throw us back - Into a jungle of nations
All will salute the enormous bluff
That never made you blush
That never made you - Hush!
