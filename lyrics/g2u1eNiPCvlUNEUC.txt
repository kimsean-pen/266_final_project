Walking out the door this morning
Wondering what it is that's going on with you, on with you
Thinking of a way to say I'm sorry
For something that I'm not sure I do, sure I do

So come on baby, let me in
And show me what this really is

'Cause something must have made you say that
What did I do to make you say that to me?
Something must have made you so mad
What can I do to make you say come back to me?

Hoping for a moment that I turn around
And you'll be coming after me, after me
'Cause all that I can say is that it's obvious
It's obvious you're all I see, all I see

So come on, baby, let me in
And show me what this really is about
'Cause I can't read you
Come on baby, let me in
And show me what this really is

'Cause something must have made you say that
What did I do to make you say that to me?
Something must have made you so mad
What can I do to make you say come back to me?
Come back to me

And I'll be here in the morning if you say stay
If you say stay to me, oh
And I'll be here in the morning if you say stay
If you say stay to me, oh
And I'll be here in the morning if you say stay
If you say stay to me, oh

Something must have made you say that
What did I do to make you say that to me?
Something must have made you so mad
What can I do to make you say come back to me?
Something must have made you say that
What did I do to make you say that to me?
Something must have made you so mad
What can I do to make you say come back to me?
