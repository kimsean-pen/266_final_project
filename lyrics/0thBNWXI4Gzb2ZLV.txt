You have them all right where you want them to be
Time to premise your mind games and your deceit
You play the victim in your sick foul game
At the barricades for fortunes and for fame

Deceiving, misleading
Betray them all with your deceit, dear

So angel like
Your velvet eyes, a virtuous smile
Deceive them all, you queen of lies

Your angel eyes make a flawless facade
A pure smile conceals your every fraud
There's no remorse and you have no regrets
You master them all like marionettes

Deceiving, misleading
Betray them all with your deceit, dear

So angel like
Your velvet eyes, a virtuous smile
Deceive them all, you queen of lies

Another treachery, another lie
Deceived us all in the blink of an eye
Good riddance, bid thee no farewell
Here's to your journey towards that burning hell

So angel like
Your velvet eyes, a virtuous smile
Deceive them all, you queen of lies

So angel like
Your velvet eyes, a virtuous smile
Deceive them all, you queen of lies
