There's an ocean of tears
The years before our happiness
And moving mountains into that ocean
Won't make that sadness any less
Counting the days towards our new construction
Moving mountains by compulsion
The impulse that shocks us out of our long term decision
I'm counting the days towards our love

So far apart in so many ways
Like the way five hours feels like forever
It's in our hands to make our stands
And move these continents together

He was with you like she was with me
More than a best friend, a guiding light
But lessons learned and now we have to burn
Our fires in the night

Cross the ocean of tears
Before the moving mountains disappear
