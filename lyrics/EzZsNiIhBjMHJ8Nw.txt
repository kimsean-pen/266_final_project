You read your books to make you proud
Do you know what it's all about
You hold a sin, familiar hands
And teach of the things and duds

We wonder if you realize
That some things won't change what's inside

WE ARE THE YOUTH,
We wanna age, before you went on
And way you move on
WE ARE THE YOUTH,
So we're fine
We love to dance, we love to love
We love to sing
Oh, oh, oh
WE ARE THE YOUTH
WE ARE THE YOUTH
WE ARE THE YOUTH
We love to sing
Oh, oh, oh
WE ARE THE YOUTH
WE ARE THE YOUTH
WE ARE THE YOUTH

If you decide the weight of time
Without a watch you did the clock
Did you forget the child inside
The one you always try to stop
You realize for all your months
And bless a lifetime if you would

WE ARE THE YOUTH,
We wanna age, before you went on
And way you move on
WE ARE THE YOUTH,
So we're fine
We love to dance, we love to love
We love to sing
Oh, oh, oh
WE ARE THE YOUTH
WE ARE THE YOUTH
WE ARE THE YOUTH
We love to sing
Oh, oh, oh
WE ARE THE YOUTH
WE ARE THE YOUTH
WE ARE THE YOUTH
