Went down to the river
I went down to the river
I went down to the river
To see if I could be saved

'Cause a dark cloud is coming
A dark cloud is coming
Said a dark cloud is coming
Come for me now

Called out to your Lord
Called out to the Lord
Called out to your Lord
But you never came

'Cause a dark cloud is coming
A dark cloud is coming
Yeah a dark cloud is coming
Come for me now
Come for me now
Come for me now
Come for me now
Come for me now
Come for me now
Oh, come for me now
Come for me now
Come for me now
Come for me now
Mmm, come for me now
