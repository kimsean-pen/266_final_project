Whispers in the grass
Under slow dancing trees
Birds are telling me stories
Saying you were meant for me

With their bittersweet melodies
Like a sweet memory
Bittersweet melodies
Can't go back, I can't go on without those
Bittersweet melodies

Weakened kitchen floor
Snow slips under the door
Tiny speakers were singing
Telephone always ringing

With those bittersweet melodies
Like a sweet memory
Bittersweet melodies
Can't go back, I can't go on

I remember us
'fore we turned to dusk
Just when these feelings were all about
When we still could trust in our hearts

Bittersweet memory
Like a sweet melody
Bittersweet memories
Can't go back, I can't go on
Both of us singing that same old song
With those bittersweet memories
Like a sweet melody
Bittersweet memories
And it seemed oh so wrong
Since those bittersweet melodies played for me
