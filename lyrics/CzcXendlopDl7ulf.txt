Late at night I start to think about the things I did wrong
Late at night I start to think about the things I could've done
To save us from him, to save us from her, to save us from the world

Late at night my tears start to melt my heart into gold
Late at night the silver lining turns my heart into stone
To save us from him, to save us from her, to save us from

Suddenly my heart starts to feel, yeah
My heart starts to feel,
My heart starts to feel like stone
All around is silver and gold
My heart never heals,
My heart only feels like stone
Ooh, like stone

Late at night when I'm at parties my gloom fills the room
Late at night when I'm dancing with other girls I pretend it's you
To save me from hurt, to save me from hurt, to save me from

Suddenly my heart starts to feel, yeah
My heart starts to feel,
My heart starts to feel like stone
All around is silver and gold
But my heart never heals,
My heart only feels like stone

Suddenly my heart starts to feel, yeah
My heart starts to feel,
My heart starts to feel like stone
All around is silver and gold
But my heart never heals,
My heart only feels like stone
Ooh, like stone

I tried my hardest, I tried my best
But you just don't seem satisfied
And now I'm here all alone tonight
When I think of you, I cry

Suddenly my heart starts to feel, yeah
My heart starts to feel,
My heart starts to feel like stone
All around is silver and gold
But my heart never heals,
My heart only feels like stone

Suddenly, oh, oh
(My heart starts to feel, yeah)
(My heart starts to feel,)
(My heart starts to feel like stone)
All around me, silver and silver and gold
(My heart never heals)
My heart only feels like stone

Late at night when I'm all alone I think of you
