Here I am
In this strange world
A different universe
Nowhere in time
I'm captured in my dreams
On this lonely journey
To find the morning light
To be me
Eternal life
Beyond the death we know
A restless soul
But am I dead?

(Lost in nowhere, timeless prison
Will I ever find the reason
I wish that I could escape this dream
Can I ever return to reality)

This labyrinth
of my own feelings
A misty ocean
But where's the shore?

I know that I exist
But somehow I don't
Can't find the morning light
Can't be me

Here I am
In this strange world
A different universe
Nowhere in time

Lost in nowhere, timeless prison
