To my surprise one hundred stories high
People getting loose now, getting down on the roof
I tell ya, the folks were screaming
They was, they was out of control
Oh, it was so entertaining
When the boogie starts to explode
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) Burn the mother down
(Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) Burn the mother down

Satisfaction, you came in a chain reaction
Yeah, I couldn't get enough, so I had to self-destruct
I tell ya, the heat was on, it was rising to the top
Well now, now everybody is going strong
That is where my spark got hot
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) Burn the mother down
(Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) Burn the mother down

(Up above my head, I hear music in the air)
I hear music, I hear music
(That makes me know there's a party somewhere)

Satisfaction, you came in a chain reaction
Well now, now I couldn't get enough
So I had to self-destruct
I tell ya the heat was on, it was rising to the top
Well now, now everybody is going strong
Yeah, that is where my spark got hot
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) Turn the mother 'round, yeah
(Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) Burn the mother down

(Burn baby burn)
(Burn baby burn) Burn the mother down, yeah
(Burn baby burn)
(Burn baby burn)

(I just can't stop when my spark gets hot)
I just can't stop when my spark gets hot
Don't rescue me, let my spirit run free
Don't rescue me, let my spirit run free
