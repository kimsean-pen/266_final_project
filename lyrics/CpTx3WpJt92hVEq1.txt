Let me, let me, tell more mouth
Bold eyes
Oh no no no don't don't don't

Will they let me tell more mouth
Bold eyes
Oh no no don't don't don't don't

(all I got from the background is 'say it say it say it say it')
Yes I'm in love
Yes I'm in love
And afraid to see you
Til the next one
Yes I'm in love
Yes I'm in love
And afraid to see you
Your wrath

Do we deny then
Worth we have yet had chorus
Desperate gender
No
Are we united
worth we have yet had
Desperate angel
No

Are we agreed
Now we are free
To the feelings we should have
They've all gone dancing
Now we agree
Now we are we
And the feelings we should have
They've all gone dancing

chorus

Feels
Now we are angels
Excellent deal
Soon all of it falls
