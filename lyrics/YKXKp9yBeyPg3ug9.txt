I Feel Your Heart
I Feel At Home
I Feel Our Hearts
You Fill My Soul

I Feel Your Heart
I Feel At Home
I Feel Our Hearts
You Fill My Soul
Hold Me

Into Your Arms
We Will Be Living
Into Your Arms
One More Day
When Everything's Gone Wrong
And All The Light Just Hides

When Everything's Gone Wrong
And All The Light Just Hides
When Everything's So Wrong
Won't You Just
Hold Me
Into Your Arms
We Will Be Living
Into Your Arms
One More Day
One More Day
I'm Breathing Out A Love Once Lost
I'll Never Make It
You Fill My Soul
