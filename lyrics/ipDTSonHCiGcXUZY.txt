I pretend that I'm the mountains, pretend that I'm the sky
Cause both those things will still be here after the day I die
So we set our plans in motion, fall but learn to fly
And even if we never can won't know until we try so

Don't be lonely I'm right here by your side
Hold on to me you won't drown you will survive
Move with the tide, move with the tide

You pretend that you're so simple just made of chemicals like me
But you are so much more than that, I just wish that I could freeze
The moment that I see you there, that you grab a hold of me
The breeze that brings me down to
earth, leaves me higher than the trees so

Don't be lonely I'm right here by your side
Hold on to me you won't drown you will survive
Move with the tide, move with the tide

So don't be lonely I'm right here by your side
Just hold on to me you won't drown you will survive
Move with the tide
Move with the tide

I pretend that I'm the mountains, pretend that I'm the sky
Cause both those things will still be here after the day I die
