Don't Mess With Doctor Dream
Don't Mess With Doctor Dream
Come lay your head down on the stone
So cool and white and welcome home
Oh lose your troubles, ease your pain
Soothe your soul in golden rain
(bridge)
Blue Marble Seas
I will make you feel so good
Roll over me
Blue marble dreams
Like you always knew you would
Roll over me
(chorus)
DON'T MESS WITH DOCTOR DREAM
DON'T MESS WITH DOCTOR DREAM
HE'S NOT ONE FOR SYMPATHY
DON'T MESS WITH DOCTOR DREAM
DON'T MESS WITH DOCTOR DREAM
HE WILL BRING YOU TO YOUR KNEES
In the hours before the dawn
You curse the day that you were born
Oh those demons scream in ecstasy
And you crawl around in agony
Doctor jeers and fades away
Yeah this is the price that you must pay
(REPEAT BRIDGE)
Don't take that take this!
Take this!
He's not one for sympathy
He will bring you to your knees
Oh lose your troubles, ease your pain
This is the price that you must pay
(REPEAT CHORUS)
Don't take that take this!
