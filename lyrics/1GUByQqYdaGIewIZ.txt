Listen up: Think it's time that we started
talkin' 'bout everything that's goin' down
Can you see it too?
They never seem to tell the truth

Listen up: 'Cos I know the tensions thick
'n, is it you they're always bringin' down
Now it's time they lose
We'll take it back, we'll run 'em all right through

Build it up, tear it down now
Build it up, tear it down, we ain't takin' no more

Build it up, tear it down now
Build it up, tear it down, we ain't takin' no more

Why were we fighting?
When we don't have time to let go (now we're ready to go)

Why were we fighting?
When we don't have time, no
We don't have time, so let's go!

Give it up
Think it's time that you started prayin'
Can't have another wasted life
You're not so concerned
You're sellin' out for blood you've earned

Give it up
I can feel your anger rising
Feel the smoke that had been blinding eyes
Now the tide has turned
You'll breathe the ash from bridges that you've burned

Build it up, tear it down now
Build it up, tear it down, we ain't takin' no more

Why were we fighting?
When we don't have time to let go (now we're ready to go)

Why were we fighting?
When we don't have time, no
We don't have time, so let's go!

I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
Be free

I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
Be...
Free!

Why were we fighting?
When we don't have time to let go (now we're ready to go!)

Why were we fighting?
When we don't have time, no
We don't have time, so let's go!
