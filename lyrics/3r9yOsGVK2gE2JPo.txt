Walking away.
It's not the same as running
Is it to you now
That you've run this in the ground?
and you say "Take this,
This medicine is just what you deserve
Swallow, choke, and die.

And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth
One that's void of all discretion, such an awful tearing sound
With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare
Glaring over you and over you, this feeling of despair
Is never wearing out.

It's wearing off
And it's leaving you with such a heavy heart
And a head to match
The bottle is waiting
The cap is twisted, begging to be used
And so are you.

And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth
One that's void of all discretion, such an awful tearing sound
With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare
Glaring over you and over you, this feeling of despair
Is never wearing out.

Wearing out, wearing out.
