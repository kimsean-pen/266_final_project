I'll pick you up at seven,
We can drive around and see a movie
Every scene will have a meaning
But you'll be the one that moves me
I've been hurt before,
So baby promise that you're gonna be true
I'm gonna BB good,
So tell me that you're gonna be good too
Yeah!

You gotta BB good to me,
I'm gonna BB good to you
We'll be happy as can be,
Just gotta BB good to me
Baby

I'm gonna treat you right,
We'll never fight, now baby you can trust me
When I hold you tight,
I feel alright, I guess that I'm just lucky
Now I've been hurt before,
So baby promise that you're gonna be true (oh)
I'm gonna BB good,
So tell me that you're gonna be good too (ow!)

You gotta BB good to me,
I'm gonna BB good to you
We'll be happy as can be,
You've gotta BB good to me
Baby

Listen girl, you gotta be good
I don't wanna hurt you,
I wanna kiss you!

(Yeah!)
(Come on, come on)
(Come over here)

You gotta BB good to me,
I'm gonna BB good to you
We'll be happy as can be,
You've gotta BB good to me (come on, come on)
You gotta BB good to me,
I'm gonna BB good to you
We'll be happy as can be,
Just gotta BB good to me (yeah!)

Listen girl, you're outta control
I think you and me would be a great couple
Yeah
