(Send me some lovin')
Send it, I pray
How can I love you?
When you're so far away

Honey send my your picture
Send it my dear
So I can hold it
And pretend you are near

Can you send me your kisses?
I still feel your touch
And oh I need you so badly
And I want you so much

My days are so lonely
And oh my nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm longin'
And I'm waitin' for you

I want you to
(Send me some lovin')
Send me some of that lovin' baby
(Send it I pray)
Send it I, I, I, I pray
(How can I love you?)
How in the world can I love you?
(When you're so far away)
When you're so, so, so far away

(Send my your picture)
Send me your picture baby
(Send it my dear)
And oh send it my dear
(So I can hold it)
I want so badly to hold it
(And pretend that you're near)
And I, I wanna pretend that you're near

(Send me some lovin')
Send me lovin' baby
(Send it I pray)
Send it I, I, I, I, I pray
(How can I love you?)
How can I love you?
