When you were young
And your heart
Was an open book
You used to say
Live and let live!
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever changing world
In which we live in.
Makes you give in a cry
Say live and let die!
(Live and let die!)
Live and let die!
(Live and let die!)
What does it matter to ya?
When you got a job to do
You gotta do it well.
You got to give the other them a hand!
You used to say
Live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever changing world
In which we live in
Makes you give in a cry
Say live and let die!
(Live and let die!)
Live and let die!
(Live and let die!)
