I wanna get something outta my head
I wanna get it out, I don't wanna retread
Those negative vibes that I get with you
Before I realised I was in a slew

I never really thought about it, I never cared
Something's holding me back, it's in the back of my head
I never really thought about it, I never cared
Something's holding me back, it's in the back of my head

I don't need you
I'm gonna leave you
Need no review
I don't need you

Why I always gotta be the one to pursue?
When all we ever wanted was a friend to turn to
These negative vibes that are so undue
Before I realised I was done with you

I never really thought about it, I never cared
Something's holding me back, it's in the back of my head
I never really thought about it, I never cared
Something's holding me back, it's in the back of my head

I don't need you
I'm gonna leave you
Need no review
I don't need you

I never really thought about it, I never cared
Something's holding me back, it's in the back of my head
I never really thought about it, I never cared
Something's holding me back, it's in the back of my head

I don't need you
I'm gonna leave you
Need no review
I don't need you
