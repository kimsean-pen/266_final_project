well sometimes I get lonely
even though it's only been a good
forty five minutes since I left your house
and I can't help from feeling like I'm tired of
being slowed down by all the shit I put inside myself
it's time to get some help
from someone who's not you or my parents
cause there's no one else, who can,
work these issues out except for me
so I guess that we'll see in a few years
if all the work we did held strong
and if I ever move out of my dads house
then I will finally be alone
this is exactly what I told myself I didn't want
but I guess it's not, that far of a drive back to my house
it's closer than it may seem if you
can manage to find a good parking spot
it could be worse
at least i still get to be around you
every chance that I can
