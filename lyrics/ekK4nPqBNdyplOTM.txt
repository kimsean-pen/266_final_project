We embrace
Judgment day
We embrace new inventions
Find your grace in defeat
We embrace new intentions
Forced on us by decree

We are the ones to change the world now
Still in control of all machinery
We claim the right to pull the trigger and damage
Your image of honor

Inventing
Improving
Creating
Existence
Embrace the technological remedy

Robotic legions stand in line to carry out
The retribution and effects of this advanced technology
All new inventions have to pay
They have to fight their way to judgment day
Technological tragedy is near

We are the ones that rule the world now
You are entrapped by blind inanity
There is no way that you'll revoke your decision
Now look for distraction

Inventing
Improving
Creating
Existence
Embrace the technological elegy

Robotic legions stand in line to carry out
The retribution and effects of this advanced technology
All new inventions have to pay
They have to fight their way to judgment day
Technological force

We are the enhanced natural leaders
Turning righteous men into deceivers

Schemes of the mind
Absence of soul
Symbol of the triumph over human race
Cold-blooded kind
Minds are controlled
Doomsday has arrived, there is no escape

I am forever the snake devouring its tail
In search of eternity

We embrace new inventions
Find your grace in defeat
We embrace new intentions
No one stands in our way

Inventing
Improving
Creating
Existence
Embrace the technological misery

Robotic legions stand in line to carry out
The retribution and effects of this advanced technology
All new inventions have to pay
They have to fight their way to judgment day
Technological times shall flourish

Fight your
(We are your leaders)
Way out
(Never displease us)
Show no remorse
