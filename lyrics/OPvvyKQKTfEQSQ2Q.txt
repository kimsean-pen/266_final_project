I think about you every single day
And every time I see your face, I wake and it brings me to tears
We hadn't spoken in years
We were close when we were young and naive
We grew up and we learned other things
You'll always be sweet 16
And you will always be perfect
You'll always be beautiful
Our hearts will never forget you
You didn't belong here
And it's become so clear
Why heaven called your name
I miss you and it still feels like I know you
I've got pictures of us side by side to show you
But it feels like I owe you so much more
And you will always be perfect
You'll always be beautiful
Our hearts will never forget you
You didn't belong here
And it's become so clear
Why heaven called your name
And it just doesn't seem right, was it really your time?
Are we dreaming?
We'll never let go of you
Wish you were here but it's becoming clear
That Earth's just not the place for an angel like you
For an angel like you
You meant so much to so many
I'm not quite sure how to do justice to you
If they're ready to say goodbye
I know i'm not
You made the news and the papers for days and days
But it hardly seems fair
The whole world should know your name
I want them to know your name
And you will always be perfect
You'll always be beautiful
Our hearts will never forget you
You didn't belong here
And it's become so clear
Why heaven called your name
And it just doesn't seem right, was it really your time?
Are we dreaming?
We'll never let go of you
Wish you were here but it's becoming clear
That Earth's just not the place for an angel like you
And now we must let you move forward
Our love lies with you
Our souls fly with you
