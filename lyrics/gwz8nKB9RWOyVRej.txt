Good morning

Consider I
Always struggle with the right word
Meow meow meow meow meow
As a sinner I unlock
Nothing but me

Sinner I
Sinner I
Sinner I
Oh oh oh oh
Mother wants to hold me down
Oh oh oh oh

Wait in the car
I got the business
Forget the sun
Time to get off, take it or not
'Cause strategies are for punks
Mother wants to hold me down
Mother wants to hold me down
Gonna chase the stars
Making a map, scraping off the sky
Just to fall back

Sinner I
Sinner I
Sinner I
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
