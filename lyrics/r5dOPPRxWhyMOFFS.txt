Honestly, I've not the foggiest idea
Just what I'm doing here
But why should I go?

I can't believe (I can't believe)
That our home is blown (to smithereens)
And at night the radiation makes it glow

You see, I've been inclined
To get you off of my mind
So I will, I will tonight
Alright, yeah!

It's not so bad
To be the only one left here
Though the science may seem queer
It's all that I've got now

I can't believe that you left me here
The sole survivor
Of the bomb that dropped from the holocaust

You see, I've been inclined
To get you off of my mind
So I will, I will tonight
Oh no!

See I've been inclined
To get you off of my mind
So I will, I will tonight
Do it again!
See I've been inclined
To get you off of my mind
So I will, I will
Tonight
The only trouble is
You're gettin' hard to resist
But I will, I will
I'll take that little pill
Oh, I will, I will
Tonight
