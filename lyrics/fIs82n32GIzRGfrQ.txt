Rainy clouds covered up the sunny sky
Now I know I'll sleep alone tonight
Tears and prays will be taken by the rain
Fear and loneliness in my dreams

And I know I'll never be the same
Living this tragedy, insane
All I wanna be is to be free with you, with me
I don't blame the fate but it's still hard to face the truth

It was all just like paradise
Just like we wanted to be
Far beyond the reason rest our lives
Eternity denies
The guilt of reality senselessness

Fly high, reaching skies
Two eagles flying to be free, oh
Moments of madness will be left behind
The same horizon but in different lands
Fly high, reaching skies
The same horizon but in different lands

It was all just like paradise
Just like we wanted to be
Far beyond the reason rest our lives
Eternity denies
The guilt of reality senselessness

Fly high, reaching skies
Two eagles flying to be free, oh
Moments of madness will be left behind
The same horizon but in different lands

Fly high, reaching skies
Two eagles flying to be free
Moments of madness will be left behind...

The same horizon... but in... different lands
