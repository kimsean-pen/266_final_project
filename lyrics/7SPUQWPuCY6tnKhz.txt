Hang on to the night
Watching each day pass you
Hang on to your heart
Like the future's gonna break through
Hang on to yourself
Lovers leaving and regret you
Hang on to you heart
'til you know they respect you

Hanging tonight, hanging tonight
I don't know why I sweat this
Hanging tonight, hanging tonight
But I can't get past this
Hanging tonight, hanging tonight
I just felt so helpless
Hanging tonight, hanging tonight
And I just can't shake it

Hang on to the night
Soon your mind is gonna lose you
Hang on to your hope
You have so much you gotta get through
Hang on to yourself
No good'll come from being untrue
Hang on to your heart
Lost is fame but it can stay through

Hanging tonight, hanging tonight
I don't know why I sweat this
Hanging tonight, hanging tonight
But I can't get past this
Hanging tonight, hanging tonight
I just felt so helpless
Hanging tonight, hanging tonight
And I just can't shake it

Every time you take
Take me home
I fall down on the floor
I can't take anymore
Every time you pick
You pick me up
You tell me this is what love
What all love is for

Hanging tonight, hanging tonight
I don't know why I sweat this
Hanging tonight, hanging tonight
But I can't get past this
Hanging tonight, hanging tonight
I just felt so helpless
Hanging tonight, hanging tonight
And I just can't shake it
