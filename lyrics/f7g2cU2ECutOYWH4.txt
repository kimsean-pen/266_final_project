Miss me
While I'm young
Full of wishes
Ready to go on

Miss me
While I'm young
Fast like fishes
Hot as the sun

Time won't give to us a chance to say goodbye
Time will kill us all

Miss me
Miss me
Miss me
Miss me
Miss me
Miss me
Miss me
Miss me
While I'm young

Miss me
While I'm young
When it's easy
To lose control

Miss me
While I'm young
'Cause I'm dancing
Withou a song

Time will give to us a heart attack
Time will kill us all

Miss me
While I'm young
Miss me for real

Hearts so cold must die again
Hearts so cold die
As I know
You'll be alone again
And I
