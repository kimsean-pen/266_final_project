In a world where the sun will someday die
Pay no time to the mind that's chasing bleak

Where the sun will some day die
Pay no time for the mind that's chasing bleak
Where the sun will some day die (Bleak)
Pay no time for the mind that's chasing

Never conform
It's just a ploy to make the weak ones rise
Never comply
It's just the time that the wicked will regain sight

I've arrested scorn, I've arrested scorn, I've arrested scorn
I've digested all, I've digested all, I've digested all
I've arrested scorn, I've arrested scorn, I've arrested scorn
I've digested all, I've digested all, I've digested all

Bleak
Bleak
Bleak
Bleak

Now that the walls are gone
And now you see what the world has done
You hold your stare, don't you turn away
Broken, it's broken

The horizon
The horizon is real bleak
I won't stop till terror launches
I won't stop till terror launches bleak

Sprouting the rusty cages
Regaining a conscience we've created
Over again the gears grind
Causing the ground to slope to the swine

Now that the walls are gone
And now you see what the world has done
You hold your stare, don't you turn away
Broken, it's broken

You're the one that said that I don't belong
You're the one that said that this rope was way too long

Don't want to sleep, don't want to sleep, don't want to sleep
Don't want to sleep, don't want to sleep, don't want to sleep
Don't want to sleep
Don't want to sleep
Don't want to sleep

I've arrested scorn, I've arrested scorn, I've arrested scorn
I've digested all, I've digested all, I've digested all
I've arrested scorn, I've arrested scorn, I've arrested scorn
I've digested all, I've digested all, I've digested all
I've arrested scorn, I've arrested scorn, I've arrested scorn
I've digested all, I've digested all, I've digested all
I've arrested scorn, I've arrested scorn, I've arrested scorn
I've digested all, I've digested all, I've digested all
