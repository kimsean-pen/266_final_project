Your lipstick, his collar don't bother Angel
I know exactly what goes on

When everything you'll get is
Everything that you've wanted, princess
well which would you prefer
My finger on the trigger, or
Meet face down, down across your floor
My face down, down across your floor
Meet face down, down across your floor
Well just so long as this thing is loaded

And will you tell all your friends
You've got your gun to my head
This all was only wishful thinking
This all was only wishful thinking
And will you tell all your friends
You've got your gun to my head
This all was only wishful thinking
This all was only wishful thinking
Let's go

Don't bother trying to explain Angel
I know exactly what goes on when you're on and
How about I'm outside of your window
How about I'm outside of your window
Watching him keep the details covered
You're such a sucker for a sweet talker, yeah

And will you tell all your friends
You've got your gun to my head
This all was only wishful thinking
This all was only wishful thinking
And will you tell all your friends
You've got your gun to my head
This all was only wishful thinking
This all was only wishful thinking

Hoping for the best just hoping nothing happens
A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins
I will never ask if you don't ever tell me
I know you well enough to know you never loved me
Hoping for the best just hoping nothing happens
A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins
I will never ask if you don't ever tell me
I know you well enough to know
Why can't I feel anything
From anyone other than you?
And all of this was all your fault
And all of this

I stay wrecked and jealous for this
For this simple reason
I just need to keep you in mind
As something larger than life

I stay wrecked and jealous for this
For this simple reason is true
I just need to keep you in mind
As something larger than life

I stay wrecked and jealous for this
For this simple reason is true
I just need to keep you in mind
As something larger than life
