With all of this I know now
Everythin' inside of my head
It all just goes to show how
Nothin' I know changes me at all
Again I waited for this to change instead
To tear the world in two
Another night with her
But I'm always wantin' you
Use me Holly, come on and use me
(We know, where we go)
Use me Holly, come on and use me
(We go, where we know)
With all of this I feel now
Everythin' inside of my heart
It all just seems to be how
Nothin' I feel pulls me at all
Again I waited for this to pull apart
To break my time in two
Another night with her
But I'm always wantin' you
Use me Holly, come on and use me
(We know, where we go)
Use me Holly, come on and use me
(We go, where we know)
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wantin'
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wantin', you
I'm always wantin' you
I'm always wantin' you
Use me Holly, come on and use me
(We know, where we go)
Use me Holly, come on and use me
(We go, where we know)
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wantin'
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wantin', you
Ohh and all again I wait for this
To fill a hole, to shake the sky in two
Another night with her
I'm always wantin' you
Another night with her
But I'm always wantin' you
