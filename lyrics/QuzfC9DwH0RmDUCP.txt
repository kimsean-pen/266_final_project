That night I never came home
Wandering souls captured my thoughts
Emptiness
Filled my mind
Urgency spoke her lies
In the confines of these grey walls
I watched them move together
Taking me places I cannot remember (remember)
We have been poured out into a loveless bride

How quickly I forget
That this is meaningless
How quickly I forget
That this is meaningless

In a world passing through my fingers
I still chase the wind

How quickly I forget
That this is meaningless
How quickly I forget
That this is meaningless

What have I learned from yesterday?
What have I learned from yesterday?
