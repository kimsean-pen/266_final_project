Sorry man, sorry, sorry, I've got a bad eye

I shouldn't have looked at it
I've got a bad eye
I should have listened
Go away, go away on the sugar star
Sugar star and the abortionist
You want her on the bed
With her legs wide open and her eyes all spread
The sky's a narcotic with blackjack bones
Oh Mrs. Jones
Oh Mrs. Jones
Cry me a river but just take me home
Oh Mrs. Jones
Oh Mrs. Jones
Sorry man, I've got a gut slit
Fucking ran away with my abortionist
My little eye blacked you know gizzed with
The knife they used to gut my face in
It's been out stabbing baby baby angels
Smile smile
The sky's a narcotic with blackjack bones
Oh Mrs. Jones
Please Mrs. Jones
My virus is raging and it's breaking my bones
Oh Mrs. Jones
Please Mrs. Jones
I will follow you down the sick drain
When I lean on, on the sink
Don't worry, don't worry, baby
You will never stink so bad
Sorry man, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have looked at it
I'm sorry man, you're a night blooming sickle cell
Night blooming sickle cell
I ran away, I ran away
Look into the bloodroot you suicide bitch
It takes an hour like you to make me want to live
Sorry man, I'm sorry, man
The sky's a narcotic with blackjack bones
Oh Mrs. Jones
Oh Mrs. Jones
Come get your dog, it won't leave me alone
Oh Mrs. Jones
Please Mrs. Jones
My virus is raging and it's breaking my bones
Oh Mrs. Jones
Please Mrs. Jones
Oh, cry me a river, baby, just take me home
Oh Mrs. Jones
Oh Mrs. Jones
Sister ectoplasma, she's incredulous
Just like a pro she takes off her dress
She kicks you down in her snow white pumps
Just remember it was me who found the lumps
Shit... shit... shit... shit
East is east and west is west
And mine was you
And mine was the best
And east is east and west is west
And mine was you
And mine was blind, was gold
Mrs. Jones
Don't ask me again
Don't ever talk to me like that again
