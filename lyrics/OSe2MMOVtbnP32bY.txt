Oh, darkness filled the sky as pools of water filled your eyes
They sparkled like phosphorescence in the bay
Although our lips barely touched
I have never felt so much
And I'd really like to feel that way again
Oh-oh, when?

I walk through the streets to memorize the city
I count every light until I reach the shore
Sometimes I close my eyes and you're not very pretty
Sometimes I can't believe I've had those thoughts before

We pulled a boat down to the dock and stole two steady oars
I pushed you off into the dark: acrisius favours
And from above the great abyss
You threw pennies in and wished for the feeling of wanting nothing more

Sometimes I close my eyes
And hope that I can keep away all the darkened skies

I walk through the streets to memorize the city
I count every light until I reach the shore
Sometimes I close my eyes and you're not very pretty
Sometimes I can't believe I've had those thoughts before

Sometimes I close my eyes
And hope that I can keep away all the darkened skies
