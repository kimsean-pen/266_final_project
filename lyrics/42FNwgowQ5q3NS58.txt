Promise that you always will
Candle lit on a window sill
You know that I'll be coming home
You know I never wanted to go away
But what am I suppose to say
When I hear the sound of the trumpets call
Who says, All is fair in
All is fair in love and war
I have your pictures kept close to my heart
Letters all but fall apart
Each night I read them over again
You know I never wanted to go away
But what am I suppose to say
When I hear the sound of the trumpets call
Who says, All is fair in
All is fair in love and war
No I never wanted to go away, I swear
I swear, It's war
All is fair in, Love and war
