Hey mister hey will you complain,
If for tonight we take that train, for free,
Hey pretty lady will you complain,
If for tonight we take that train,
Just you and me,
Well I'm not saying I'm the one you want,
Well I'm not saying you're the one I need,
Well I don't want to miss that one,
Well I want to be on time,
For once in my life,
Oh don't you dare,
Leave me alone,
I don't want to be on my own,
Just me and me,
Well I'm not saying I'm the one you want,
Well I'm not saying I'm the one you need,
So get back, burn the tracks and get back,
I know where you've been,
And I know what you've got for me.
