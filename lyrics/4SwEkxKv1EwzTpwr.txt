Went to a dance last Saturday night
I was feeling tipsy and the mood was right
Sight a little daughter and I step inna the corner
'Cause I feel like dancing all night

But I said
Cool down the pace for me little woman
You're dubbing it too fast for me
Cool down the pace for me little woman
That's not how it should be

I told her to try
I dunno why
No use trying 'cause she can't
And so she do it how she want

So I said
Cool down the pace for me little woman
You're rocking it too fast for me
Cool down the pace for me little woman
That's not how it should be

You're rocking too fast, for me

Said she would try
But she just don't know why
She keep on trying but she can't
And so she do it how she want, yeah

But I beg you
Cool down the pace for me little woman
You're dubbing it too fast for me
I said to cool down the pace for me little woman
That's not how it should be

Please sister try
I don't know why
No use trying 'cause you can't
And so she do it how she want, yeah

But I said cool down the pace
Please cool down the pace
You're rocking it too fast
This dance is gonna last

Move a little slower
Move a little slower, not so fast
All night this dance is gonna last
Cool down, cool down, cool down, cool down, cool down, not so fast

All night, this dance will last
Don't be in a haste
Please cool down the pace
Cool down
Sister please cool down
