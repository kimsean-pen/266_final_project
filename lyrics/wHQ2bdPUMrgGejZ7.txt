While I powder my nose
He will powder his gums
And if I try to get close
He is already gone

I don't know where he's going
I don't know where he's been
But he is restless at night
'Cause he has horrible dreams

So we lay in the dark
We've got nothing to say
Just the beating of hearts
Like two drums in the gray

I don't know what we're doing
I don't know what we've done
But the fire is coming
So I think we should run

I think we should run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

While I put on my shoes
He will button his coat
And we will step outside
Checking out the coast is clear

On both sides
We don't wanna be seen
Oh, this is suicide
But you can't see the ropes

And I won't tell my mother
It's better she don't know
And he won't tell his folks
'Cause they're already ghosts

So we'll just keep each other
As safe as we can
Until we reach the border
Until we make our plan

To run, run, run, run
To run, run, run, run
To run, run, run, run

Will you stay with me my love?
For another day
'Cause I don't want to be alone
When I'm in this state
Will you stay with me my love?
Till we're old and gray
'Cause i don't wanna be alone
When these bones decay
Run, run, run, run
Oh run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Ooh, and run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
