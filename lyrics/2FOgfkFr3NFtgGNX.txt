Yeah
Maybe I'ma get a little anxious
Maybe I'ma get a little shy
Cause everybody's trying to be famous
And I'm just trying to find a place to hide, oh
All I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
I don't even know how to explain this
I don't even think I'm gonna try

And that's ok
I promise myself one day (Hey)

I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am

Maybe I'ma get a little nervous
Maybe I don't go out anymore (oh)
Feelin' like I really don't deserve this (deserve this)
Life ain't nothing like it was before
Cause all I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
If you go and look under the surface (surface)
Baby, I'm a little insecure

And that's okay (baby and that's okay)
I promised myself one day (Hey)

I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all (all)
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either
Hate me or love me (hate me or love me)
But that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am (I am), that's just the way I am (I am)
That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am

Im'a tell em' all (that's just the way I am)
Im'a tell em' all that you could either hate me or love me
(that's just the way I am)
But that's just the way I am
I am, am, am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted
I am, am, am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted all along

Everybody's trying to be famous

Hate me or love me (hate me or love me)

But that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am (maybe I'ma get a little anxious)
