Keep looking
Keep looking for a broken grace
It seems like you're always there, alone
Why can't you just take me?
Give me a???
You said you'll come to me
No time for can and wait

Time to spit it out!
Spit you out!

Black cigar of a surgeon on the second floor
They've all been here before
You came
I'm shouting out names
Like a broken crown
Of what they rule not know
You never knew the sound

Smiling out, open wide
Turn around
Spit you out
Spit you out
Spit you out

Spit you out
Spit you out
Spit you out
Spit you
