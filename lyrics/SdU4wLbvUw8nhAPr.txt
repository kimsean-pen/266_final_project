Love has taken me for a fool
Gotten out in time to save himself, mmmm.
Shoulda known better
But I let things slide.
I took you for granted
That you'd always be
The one for me.
Baby I stopped tryin.
Oh, baby don't give up on us.
I know your heart is full of doubt
You don't need to be without
These loving arms
I'll hold you through your darkest hour
I'll be using all my power
So I can reach you.
Oh my love, don't give up on us.
Am I living alone here
Or have I turned to dust?
It hurts, it hurts to wait for just a little love.
You must... give me a sign love.
Can't you see me standing here?
Alive and well with all the hope
You'll be, the one for me.
Baby ill keep trying.
Oh baby don't give up on us
I know your heart is full of doubt
You don't need to be without
These loving arms.
I'll hold you through your darkest hour.
I'll be using all my power
So I can reach you.
Oh my love, don't give up on us.
Maybe the way out is here
It went where it all begins.
We can't go on, living on a cloud
We'll never find our way home.
Oh, let me reach you, oh my love
Come on let me in.
Oh let me hold you, oh my love
Don't give up on us.
Oh let me reach you, oh my love
Come on let me in.
Oh let me hold you, oh my love
Don't give up on us.
