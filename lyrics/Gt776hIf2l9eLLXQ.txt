It's time to go into the me below
My morbid self beneath
A peril trip the last way out
I spin as I let go
In spirals down the narrow lines
Passing through my aura
Spit me out into my mind
A journey through disease

I'm behind my cynic eyes
That stare but can not see
The sickness in me ... beneath ...

I fall in untruthful me the essence of
My thoughts
Swirling in a thousand vows endless
Truth less

What am I this me beneath
A vain organic lie
That rules me from inside

Immobile now I bow before reality itself
It's substance moving through my eyes
My life is transferred once suffused upon
My mind the view erases burns inside
And then another fall

I plunge into a well of lies a cold
Perennial flow the vortex of my soul
