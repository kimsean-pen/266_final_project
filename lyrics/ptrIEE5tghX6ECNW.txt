It's more than love
And it's less than love
It's what I give to you.
It's more than love
And it's less than love
It's what I give to you, you, you.
All there is is in the knowing that this never had to end.
All there is to know.
If I could take,
heart in hand,
what I'd give to you.
If I could take,
heart in hand,
what I'd give to you, you.
All there is is in the knowing that this never had to end.
All there is to know.
This never had to end.
It's more than love
And it's less than love
It's what I give to you.
It's more than love
And it's less than love
It's what I give to you, you, you.
All there is is in the knowing that this never had to end.
All there is to know.
