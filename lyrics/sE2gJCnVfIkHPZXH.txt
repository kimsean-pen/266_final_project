Within you, there's a place
A pain you never asked for
But it gives you everything

A torture to embrace
If I could know it completely
I would give you everything

How could you go telling yourself
Lies about you
Lies about you
What if I said that there is nothing
That I don't already know
Cause I already know

I want to find out that we're alright
That death is a journey
And life is just a realization
That you would not get all creation
In our hands

How could you go telling yourself
Lies about you
Lies about you
What if I said that there is nothing
That I don't already know
Yes, I already know

And you keep yourself locked up inside [?]
[?] for you to find
