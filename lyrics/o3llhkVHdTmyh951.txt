There is history in this place,
And there are dragons to be chased,
And though i don't know who you are,
An easy flow, and a strong, a strong heart,
And the charm in the way you hide.
Gently take my skull, for a ride...

And i don't know who you are,
But i know what i would like you to be,
A one night stand, under stoned persuasion,
But a joy that i can't hide,
Gently take my skull, for a ride...

We can never ever go too far,
The pain we can't escape atleast will wait,
So let's go quickly, no, we go slow,
Let's go chasing dragons through the snow,
Kindly take my all,
And give me all you have,
Gently take my skull, for a ride...

Take and shake your soul,
And never lose control,
Gently take your skull, for a ride.
