A long day alone
The emptiness is so real
Never having peace of mind
Running from what I can't see
And there is nowhere left to hide
Turn and face these empty eyes
All alone, heart untold, trying to find
Break me down

Replace this fear inside
Take this nothingness from me
I want to find, I want to shine, I want to rise
Break me down
I try to find myself
I find the stranger trapped inside

And I take one more step away
From a face I used to recognize
Familiar shadows closing in
A suffocating fear descends
It comes alive, uncovered eyes, trying to find
Break me down
Replace this fear inside

Take this nothingness from me
I want to find, I want to shine, I want to rise
Break me down
Replace this fear inside
Take this nothingness from me
I want to find, I want to shine, I want to rise
Break me down

Break me down
I want to find, I want to shine, I want to rise
Break me down
I want to find, I want to shine, I want to rise
Break me down
I want to find, I want to shine, I want to rise
Break me down
Break me!
