I had a vision in the chapel
Flame flickered on your forehead like an apple
When the morning came
I was enthrilled by your movement

But I was scared wrote a letter
To articulate my thoughts a little better
When the time came for speaking my mind it was gone

The garden's overgrown
Is the fact of the matter
Now It's just a field behind the house
Where the creepers kinda swallow the light

Where you wait for a talking snake
for a calendar date something you can rely on
You can steady the scale with my heart in a pail if I'm wrong.

When I was young and not a cynic,
I felt a gravity beyond the city limits
out in the violent heart,
I couldn't start to explain it

But all my lovers turn to friends,
and I'm in London singing "If It be your will" again.
When the time came for speaking my mind it was gone

The garden's overgrown
Is the fact of the matter
Now It's just a field behind the house
Where the creepers kinda swallow the light

Where you wait for a talking snake
for a calendar date something you can rely on
You can steady the scale with my heart in a pail if I'm wrong.

I miss my childhood house where my heart slowed down.
I could take control of myself there
Since our childhood homes are apartments, though,
I've been finding I don't feel the same way now.

The garden's overgrown
Is the fact of the matter
Now It's just a field behind the house
Where the creepers kinda swallow the light

Where you wait for a talking snake
for a calendar date something you can rely on
You can steady the scale with my heart in a pail if I'm wrong.
You can steady the scale with my heart in a pail if I'm wrong.
You can steady the scale with my heart in a pail if I'm wrong.
