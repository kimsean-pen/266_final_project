Bow for him, bow to the supremacy
Bow for him, at last

You do believe, so I can say
That you are owned by me

Bow for him, bow to the supremacy
Bow for him, at last

You do believe, so let us pray
For all those fools that be

Fool, dance with me again
I am your destiny, mark my words
Don't you ever disagree
Fool, kneel for me again
I am your agony, walk my way
I will never set you free

Live for me, a longing fool
Bow to the supremacy
Live for me, you won't regret
Die for the divinity

Bow for me, bow to the supremacy
Bow for me at last

You do believe, so you display
All that we want to see

Fool, dance with me again
I am your destiny, mark my words
Don't you ever disagree
Fool, kneel for me again
I am your agony, walk my way
I will never set you free

Bow for me, just do it
Walk my way, just to serve me
Bow for me, just do it
Kneel for me and obey me

A humble reflection
Before the unrushing descent is he
Not able to turn back, anymore

Bow to me, bow to the supremacy
Kneel for me, down for the divinity

Come to me, bow for me
Just do it now to the supremacy
Kneel for me, down for me
Just do it now for the divinity

Believing is the cure
Religion is like opium
You better think at all
Before you start thinking you

Fool, dance with me again
I am your destiny, mark my words
Don't you ever disagree
Fool, kneel for me again
I am your agony, walk my way
I will never set you free

Fool, dance with me again
I am your destiny, mark my words
Don't you ever disagree
Fool, kneel for me again
I am your agony, walk my way
I will never set you free

Bow for me, just do it
Bow for me, just do it
Bow for me, just do it
Bow for me, just do it
