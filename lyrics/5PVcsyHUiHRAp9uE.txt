Oh, my heart is swollen
And I need these skies
To show how
I left myself lost out the door
Riding around
... feeling eyes
So I can't see
That I left myself lost out the door

I could get way if I wanted to
My hands are tied
Tied to you
But I don't mind, no
I could get way if I wanted to
My hands are tied
Tied to you
But I don't mind, no

A silver line in a dark sky
And I pay no mind
But still try
But I left myself lost out the door
Working day
Across you
The time we pray
When I forgive you
But I left myself lost out the door

I could get way if I wanted to
My hands are tied
Tied to you
But I don't mind, no
I could get way if I wanted to
My hands are tied
Tied to you
But I don't mind, no

Stay true to you
When you know
So I'm holding out
To gracefully grow old
And the wiser any man could be
Makes the suffering all the more easy
The more easy

I could get way if I wanted to
My hands are tied
Tied to you
But I don't mind, no
I could get way if I wanted to
My hands are tied
Tied to you
But I don't mind, no
