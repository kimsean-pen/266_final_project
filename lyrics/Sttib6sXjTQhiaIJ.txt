I never lost sight of my fate
Many tried to block my ways but persistence kept me going on
Now we trespass the line of time
Going back but I'm right here, now and then, all done

Wake the dream and face the facts
Bridge the gap between the gaps
In every blast that starts your mind
You're there and only there you are

The lines are crossed, I'm way ahead
Just need to balance the razor's edge
Nothing can stop us, stop us
'Cause it was built from what we gave, that's right!

Now we trespass the line of time
Now we trespass the line of time
