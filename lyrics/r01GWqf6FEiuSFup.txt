We'll base these lies on this one night for you, oh
Out of the mold we'll rise
Out of the mold.
Take back what I own.
And for you, I'm alone.
This household wreaks
Indifference is a curse
That we can't pass by
We will love
I break you down, Aaaah
We will love
I break you.
This blow never came so fast
This breathe will be his last
The dreams alive.
We all suffer from insecurities
Put your hands to the sky
Holding by a lie.
Now I know... where I'm from today
Now I know... where I'm from today
Said that you wanted to know
How is it going to go
Failed my life.
Out of stone... we all fall away
Out of stone... we all fall away
And here comes the attitude.
Well I'm not even mad at you.
And just sit back and take a cue.
There's nothing left for you.
