I can feel a sorrow linger in my mind
And the dark that follows
Makes me falter in my life
There's a darkness, there's a light
A narrow path and a wide

There is no tomorrow for the lost and blind
There's no glee, nor sorrow
In the maelstrom of their minds
There's an hour, there's a time
Is this the end of the line?

There's a fire fading deep within
Lost its spark, its will to be
There are seven doors within my dreams
I've found them all, but still no key
