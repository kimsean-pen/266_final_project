I'm feeling kind of pressured, I feel it tonight
The feeling that I've got to set the party off right
The pressure makes it better, I've said it before
I give into the music, but the music wants more
It's time to feel the beat in my skin
The people keep on begging me to give in
Feel the way that they want to move
Too many people trying to tell you what to do

I'm not gonna tell you to dance
Just gonna keep on doing my thing (my thing)
I'm not gonna tell you to move
Just gonna keep on playing the way I'm playing

Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance
Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance

Just give up the illusion that you're going to win
There will be no confusion 'cause you're gonna give in
I see your body moving and it can't be ignored
You move a little harder but I think I want more
It's time to feel the beat in my skin
The people keep on begging me to give in
Feel the way that they want to move
Too many people trying to tell you what to do

I'm not gonna tell you to dance
Just gonna keep on doing my thing (my thing)
I'm not gonna tell you to move
Just gonna keep on playing the way I'm playing

Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance
Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance

This isn't an apology just some reverse psychology
'Cause if I tell you not to do something then
I can guarantee (you'll do it)

I'm not gonna tell you to dance
Keep on doing my thing (my thing)
(Over, over, over, over)

I'm not gonna tell you to dance
Gonna keep on doing my thing (my thing)
I'm not gonna tell you to move
Just gonna keep on playing the way I'm playing

Don't dance

I'm not gonna tell you to dance
Just gonna keep on doing my thing (my thing)
I'm not gonna tell you to move
Just gonna keep on playing the way I'm playing

Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance
Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance
Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance
Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance
