Your love is king
Crown you in my heart
Your love is king
Never need to part
Your kisses ring
Round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me
It's making my soul sing
Tearing the very heart of me
I'm crying out for more

Your love is king
Crown you in my heart
Your love is king
You're the ruler of my heart
Your kisses ring all around
Round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me
It's making my soul sing
Tearing the very heart of me
Your love is king

I'm coming on
I'm... coming...
Making me dance inside...

Your love is king
Crown you in my heart
Your love is king
Never need to part
Your kisses ring
Round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me
It's making my soul sing
Tearing the very heart of me
Crying out for your love

Touching the very part of me
It's making my soul sing
I'm crying out for more
Your love is king
This is no blind faith
This is no
No-no-no
Sad or sorry dream
This is no blind faith
Your love your love is real

Gotta crown me with your heart
(your love is king)
Never never need to part
Oh touch me
(your love is king)
I'm coming
Making me dance
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Inside

Your love is...
Your love
Your love
Your love is king
(God bless you Sade) We love you
