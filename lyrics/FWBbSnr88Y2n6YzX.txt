I've waited for moments of clarity
Sleepwalkin' through life like a daydream
Time's not on our side and you out of my mind
I'm free falling through my heart's vacancy

Don't give up on what we've got

Even though fate never goes our way
I'm gonna, gonna get to you anyway
(Don't give up on what we've got)
When the signs say that we're insane
I'm gonna, gonna love ypu anyway
(Don't give up on what we've got)

I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love you anyway

I'm callin' out, can you hear me?
'Cause the silence is deafening
No matter how we try
We're in a different place and time
But what we have is too good to release

I won't give up on what we've got

Even though fate never goes our way
I'm gonna, gonna get to you anyway
(Don't give up on what we've got)
When the signs say that we're insane
I'm gonna, gonna love ypu anyway
(Don't give up on what we've got)

I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love you anyway

Don't give up on what we've got
(On what we've got, on what we've got)
Don't give up on what we've got

Even though fate never goes our way
I'm gonna, gonna get to you anyway
(Don't give up on what we've got)
When the signs say that we're insane
I'm gonna, gonna love ypu anyway
(Don't give up on what we've got)

I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love you anyway
