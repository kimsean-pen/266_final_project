You've got a way of
Watching the world divide
You into place
Direction is lost in flight

Everyone is gone, let it slip away
Look at you, at the end of it
This moment will rise
And it takes you further inside

In through your wall again
That covers you once you're in
In through your wall again
Until you can reach the end

I can see through
When communication is gone
The pieces of you
Fall down from the clouds you were on

Everyone is gone, let it slip away
Look at you, now you're at the end
This moment will rise
And takes you further inside

In through your wall again
That covers you once you're in
In through your wall again
Until you can reach the end
In through your wall

Empty your head and the rest will come
I missed you then the moment was gone
Look at you now this moment will rise
And it takes you further inside
Lost your place but no one can tell
That you're sick of losing yourself

In through your wall again
That covers you once you're in
In through your wall again
And now you're complete within
