I used to think humility was everything
The only way through to all sounds

I fought against the ego
I fought, fear by me closer to the truth
I fought against the ego
I knew it brought me closer to losin'

From first step to last
I'm? from the ashes
From first step to last
I'm tender to you

I used to think that I was bound to reverence
The only way through to my help

I fell into the ego
I feel, it brought me closer to my youth
I fell into the ego
I knew it brought me closer to hybris

From first step to last
I'm? from the ashes
From first step to last
I'm tender to you

From first step to last
I'm? from the ashes
From first step to last
I'm tender to you
