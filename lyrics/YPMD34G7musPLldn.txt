Once you fell out of love
Our love couldn't carry you
And I didn't even notice
For our love kept me safe from death

You doubted the lights
And the shelter it can give
For in love we are immortal
Eternal and safe from death

If I regret us
I'm denying my soul to grow
Don't remove my pain
It is my chance to heal

We carry the same wound
But have different cures
Similar injuries
But opposite remedies

After our love ended
Your arms don't carry me
Without love I feel the abyss
Understand your fear of death

I will not forget
This Notget
Will you not regret
Having love let go

After our love ended
Your spirit entered me
Now we are the guardians
We keep her safe from death

Love will keep all of us safe from death
Love will keep all of us safe from death
Love will keep us same from death
(Safe! From!)
Love will keep all of is safe from death
Death
Death
Love will keep us safe from (from) death
(Safe safe from from death death)
Deeeeeaaaatthhhhhhhh!
