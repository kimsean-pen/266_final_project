Don't feel shit unless it's pain
Nothing registers, no not even my name
If you decide to get close, what I need the most
Is my face in the dirt, make it hurt

Pupils dilate, salivating don't make me wait
Break my ribs, rip out my nails
I feel alive, it never fails

Make it hurt, make it hurt
I can't feel you if you don't
Make it hurt, make it hurt
I can't feel you if you won't
Make it hurt
I can't feel you if you don't
Make it hurt

I'm pulling out my jagged teeth, need to know what's underneath
I'm pulling out my jagged teeth, I need to know what's underneath
Can't take one more second hearing the voices disagree
They're not speaking words so dig your nails into my throat
And listen to my plea
Make it hurt

Make it stop, make it quiet for a bit
I'm fucked in the head that much I'll admit
So do me a favor, I know the cure
Make it hurt for me, don't ask cause I'm sure
Help me out, make it quiet for tonight
I know it's not safe but I'll be alright
Make it stop, make it quiet for a bit
I'm fucked in the head that much I'll admit
