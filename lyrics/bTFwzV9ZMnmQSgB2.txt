What could I even say to you Rene?
If I could stop reacting then I'd be acting like your fool because
What could I even say to you Rene?

I went to a shrink and he found my brain
And I have no ideas is what he found
I went to a shrink and he found my brain
And I have no ideas is what he found
No ideas is what he found
No ideas

I went to a shrink and he found my brain
And I have no ideas is what he found
I went to a shrink and he found my brain
And I have no ideas is what he found
No ideas is what he found
No ideas
