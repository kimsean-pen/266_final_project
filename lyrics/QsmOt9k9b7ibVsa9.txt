If you wanna see, just open your eyes
If you wanna breathe, let's go outside in the open
Out in the open

There's no need to stay locked up inside
This kingdom is yours and this kingdom is mine
Let me show you
Just let me show you

Ooh, you don't have to be afraid
You don't got to hurt away
'Cause we got a love that can't be caged
We got love a that can't be caged

Come on, come on, let your feelings out
Come on, come on, get your freedom now run wild
Run with the lions
Come on, come on, let your feelings out
Come on, come on, get your freedom now run wild
Run with the lions

If you want a voice, just open your mouth
Don't worry about the words, we'll figure it out
Just try it
Just try it

Ooh, you don't have to be afraid
You don't got to hurt away
'Cause we got a love that can't be caged
We got a love that can't be caged

Come on, come on, let your feelings out
Come on, come on, get your freedom now run wild
Run with the lions
Come on, come on, let your feelings out
Come on, come on, get your freedom now run wild
Run with the lions

We got a love that can't be caged
We got a love that can't be caged
We got a love that can't be caged

Run with the lions
Run with the lions
Come on, come on, let your feelings out
Come on, come on, get your freedom now run wild (wild)
Run with the lions

We got a love that can't be caged
We got a love that can't be caged
