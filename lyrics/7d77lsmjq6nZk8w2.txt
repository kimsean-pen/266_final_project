I had a match, but she had a lighter
I had a flame, but she had a fire
I was bright, but she was much brighter
I was high, but she was the sky

Oh baby, I was bound for Mexico
Oh baby, I was bound to let you go
Ahh haa, ahh haa
Alright, alright, alright, hey

I don't know much about Cinco De Mayo
I'm never sure, what it's all about
But I say I want you and you don't believe me
You say you want me but I've got my doubts

Oh baby, I was bound for Mexico
Oh baby, I was bound to let you go
Ahh haa, ahh haa
Alright, alright, alright, hey hoo, hoo, hay

I had a match, but she had a lighter
I had a flame, but she had a fire
I was bright, but she was much brighter
I was high, but she was the sky

Oh baby, I was bound for Mexico
Oh baby, I was bound to let you go
Ahh haa, ahh haa
Alright
