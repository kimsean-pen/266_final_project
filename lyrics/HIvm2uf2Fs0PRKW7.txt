Please don't Judas me
Treat me, as you'd like to be treated
Please don't blacklist me
Leave me, as you'd wish to find me
Don't analyse me
Sacrifice me
Please don't Judas me.

Please don't chastise me
Show me just one shred of kindness
Try to help me see
Guide me in my eyes of blindness
Don't despise me
Categorise me
Please don't Judas me.

No, no, don't Judas me
No, please don't Judas me.

Please don't headshrink me
Don't disguise your innuendos
Give no lies to me
I can see the way the wind blows
Don't debase me
Annihilate me
Please don't Judas me.

Please don't number me
Don't betray my trust and promise
Please don't anger me
I find it hard to bear no malice
Don't frustrate me
Manipulate me
Please don't Judas me.

No, no, don't Judas me
No, please don't Judas me.
