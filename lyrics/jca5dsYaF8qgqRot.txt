What is mine
What is all mine
Not my child not my child
Hold you just a little while
I'm gonna give her all my life
Until she's until she's
Swooped up by the sea of love

What is mine
What is all mine
Not my child not my child
Hold you just a little while
I'm gonna give her all my life
Until she's until she's
Swooped up by the sea of love

Ain't a man in this world who can pull me down
From my dark star dark star
I will remain there
It's done me good so far

Ain't a man in this world who can pull me down
From my dark star dark star
I will remain there
It's done me good so far

What is mine, what is all mine
Not my child not my child
Hold you just a little while
I'm gonna give her all my life
Until she's until she's
Swooped up, swooped up, by the sea of love

Ain't a man in this world who can pull me down
From my dark star dark star
I will remain there
It's done me good so far
Ain't a man in this world who can pull me down
From my dark star dark star
I will remain there
It's done me good so far

What is mine, oooh
What is all mine
Not my child, not my child
Hold you just a little while
I'm gonna give her all my life
Until she's, until she's
Swooped up by the sea of love
