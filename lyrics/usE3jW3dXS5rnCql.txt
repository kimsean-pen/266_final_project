The bad, the good, the in between
Has left us with no space to breathe
We both know that this is not where we're supposed to be
But if only I could set you free
There's no point playing make believe
Or chasing what we'll never see
And reaching in my pocket and I'd hand over the key
But if only I could set you free
If only I could set
I'm setting you free

The thought of the end is frightening
But it's all I've been imagining
Ooh, I know that you've heard it 'cause I've had you in chains
Even the way you look at me has changed
So this is my apology
I send this love with honesty
[?] you know it's me
I know it's time that I set you free
I know it's time that I set you free
I know it's time that I set
I'm setting you free

But let me hold on to the memory (free)
So a part of you remains with me
I don't know I ain't right
So I won't keep you tight
Spread your wings and take flight
I'm setting you free
Free, yeah, I'm setting you free
Setting you free
I can't keep holding you back
So I know that it's time
I know its time that I set
I'm setting you free

Oh, free, free, free
