This song is called "The ballad of me and my friends"

Everybody's got themselves a plan
Everybody thinks they'll be the man, including the girls
The musicians who lack the friends to form a band are singer-songwriters
The rest of us are DJ's or official club photographers
And tonight I'm playing another Nambucca show
So I'm going through my phonebook
Texting everyone I know
And I quite a few I don't, whose numbers found their way into my phone,Ã¬
But they might come along anyway
you never really know

None of this is going anywhere
Pretty soon we'll all be old
And no one left alive will really care
About our glory days, when we sold our souls

But if you're all about the destination, then take a fucking flight.
We're going nowhere slowly, but we're seeing all the sights.
And we're definitely going to hell,
But we'll have all the best stories to tell

And I'm definitely going to hell,
But I'll have all the best stories to tell
