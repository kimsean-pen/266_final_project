Cock that Glock, then I pop, pop, pop
All the bodies drop in my drop top
Holla fuck cops because I won't ever stop
Hit the Benz and I pop that lock
Screaming mother fuck the law while I ride around the block
Bitch, I'm so fucking sick with the shit that I spit
Watch them all get hit until I fucking get rich
Mother fuckers know what it is, $UICIDE
Give a fuck about life
Bitch, I'm ready to die
Scrim ain't shy
Scrim just high
Fuck all y'all busters ain't shit in my eyes
Brain on fried, Columbine mind
To kill all you fuckers and piss on your mothers
Call it what you want and call it how you see
One thing I know y'all ain't fucking with me
One thing I know y'all ain't fucking with me, bitch

If it was up to me, I would fuck it up
Fuck everything and bust a nut
Yung Mutt never smiles, got to cut me one
On my flip phone dialing 911
I need a pick me up
So come and picky me up
So I can pick me up about sixty bucks worth of sticky nugs
Just a quick re-up then I'm up, up and away
Bitch, I'm grey
Take me to my fucking grave
Bitch, I'm broke like the bone in your back
Get the fuck up off my wave
Let me drown in peace, bitch
Bring a gun to the beach, bitch
Blow my brains away
Brain matter scattered in the sand
Surfing blood soaked waves

I been smoking
I been smoking
I been drinking
I been drinking
I been drinking
I been drinking
I been drinking
