A customer!
Wait! What's your rush?
What's your hurry?
You gave me such a...
Fright! I thought you was a ghost!
Half a minute, can't ya sit?
Sit ya down! Sit!
All I meant is that I haven't seen a customer for weeks

Did ya come here for a pie, sir?
Do forgive me if me head's a little vague
What was that?
But you'd think we had the plague
Right you are, sir, would you like a drop of ale?
But theres- Heaven knows I try, sir!
Do forgive me if me head's a little vague
What was that?
But you'd think we had the plague
Right you are, sir, would you like a drop of ale?
But theres- Heaven knows I-

Second to none. Angel of death
Killing these bitches absolute mess
Swear to God this be why they took my wings
Even Lucifer had a little suffering, like, "FUCK!"
Demons coming out of their skin
Everyone showing there true faces
Absolutely zero that any of y'all can fucking do
Zero be the points you put up
Steph Curry with the shot, motherfucker, pull up
Step back, James Harden, clean shot killa
Take another dab, pop a xan, 'cause I'm the grim rap zilla
ONI INC. in this motherfucking bitch
Catch us in the fucking back
Motherfucking on your clique

Pie, sir?
Do forgive me if me head's a little vague
What was that?
But you'd think we had the plague
Right you are, sir, would you like a drop of ale?

Well, I'm gunnin' straight for the top
Tell these wannabes that they better freeze
To be honest never gave 'em much thought
Keep the melodies flowing and I aim to please
Told myself that if I ever made it, give myself the keys
To a rocket car, to fly to Mars, like it was meant to be
Can't stop thinking 'bout the possibilities, man
Whole crowds freaking out 'cause our shit is free and
When I bring the tree, all the stressin' stops
Living in LV, not fretting 'bout the cops
'Cause the sinners now speak, how we don't mind
Keepin' it green, now the cherry topped
When I step up on the scene, watch the haters praise until dusk
Don't mind me, while I innovate, like Elon Musk
Unknown number won't ever get the right swipe
Keep the hunters at bay, clinch the money nice and tight

Pie, sir?
Do forgive me if me head's a little vague
What was that?
But you'd think we had the plague
Right you are, sir, would you like a drop of ale?

Fuck you and everybody that you roll with
[?] taking your soul quick
Soon as you see me comin', you're hollerin', "Oh shit!"
You're nothin' less than forever testing the ghost, bitch
You're in the wrong place, partner, gettin' cut down
350 blow your leg off when I bust rounds
The killer [?] comin' at you with the dedication
Leavin' your whole team leanin', leakin' from lacerations
Shadowclan [sharp blade] bloodstain that
I'm [Totumaru?] when he died and he came back
You say the wrong thing, get your whole face slapped
It took a couple of days to get your taste back, ha
Take your life, no take backs
Ski mask, gloves, 'cuz, no trace back
[?] banana open you, when I lace that
Followed by lines of the yola
Now, can you face that?

Pie, sir?
Do forgive me if me head's a little vague
What was that?
But you'd think we had the plague
Right you are, sir, would you like a drop of ale?
