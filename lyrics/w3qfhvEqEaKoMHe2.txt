H A M L E T, yeah
Hamlet's fishin' in the grave, fishin' in the grave
Through the custard bones and stuff
He ain't got no friend in there, no he ain't got no friend in there
I believe our man's in love

Hamlet got a gun-now
He wears a crucifix, he wears a crucifix
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

Hamlet move so beautiful, moves so beautiful
Walking through the flowers
Waving to the people all those beautiful people
Lying in the shadows

He's movin' down the streets, now
He likes the look of that Cadillac and now he wants that Cadillac
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, yeah, pow, pow

Is this love some kinda love, is this love some kinda love
Now he's comin' down my street
He's crawling up my stairs, he's coming to my room
He's knocking on my door

Where for art thou baby-face, where for art thou
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

Is this some love, is this some kinda love, is this some love, pow
Is this love, is this some kinda love, is this love, pow

He shoot it inside, he shoot it inside, he shoot it inside, pow
He shoot it inside, he shoot it inside, he shoot it inside, pow

Some kinda love
Don't let 'em steal your heart away
Don't let 'em steal your heart away
He went and stole my heart, pow

Don't let 'em steal your heart away
Don't let 'em steal your heart away
He went and stole my heart pow

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, pow
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, pow

Pow, pow, pow, pow
