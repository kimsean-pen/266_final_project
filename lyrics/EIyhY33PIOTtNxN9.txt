You came and you gave without taking
The best was yet to come
I know, for I was forsaken

So I kept my fingers crossed
To win at any cost
The sound of water falling down

Knock me down, pick me up
Set me in a row

Your words hung high in the rafters
And settled down like rain
Remain happy ever after

Knock me down, pick me up
Set me in a row

Knock me down, pick me up
Set me in a row

You packed up your bags and belongings
And crept out through the back
The sound of footprints on the ground

Your words hung high in the rafters
And settled down like rain
Remain happy ever after
Happy ever after
