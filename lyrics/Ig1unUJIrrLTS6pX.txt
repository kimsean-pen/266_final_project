Human beings are stupid things when we're young
Scared stiff straight, all wooze and shakes on us
You just wait, yeah you just wait and
Suddenly we go to muted imagination

Run, it's come, gone, it got to ya
In your heart of darkness
Don't ya get lost in your heart of darkness
Your ghost, my god, there goes my monster

Ghouls and saints and phantoms and what are we afraid of
New fixates on human beings take off
You're scared straight, yeah you should wait so
Why you wanna go to insane imagination

Run, it's come, gone, it got to ya
Don't ya get lost in your heart of darkness
Your love, my god, there goes my monster

You're so straight, yeah you should wait, take off
Foolish games and fire drills
Why you love to

Run, it's come, and gone, it got to ya
Come, gone, it comes, to fascinate
Don't ya get lost in your heart of darkness
Your ghost, dear god, there goes my monster
