I don't really care if you cry
On the real you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said baby I am not afraid to, die
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

Phantom that's all red
Inside all white
Like Shawn Daniels, ride a sled
I just want that head
My Brittany got mad
I'm really her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
One way that I trap now
Stackin my bands all the way to the top, all the way till my bands fallin over
Every time that you leave your spot, your girlfriend call me like: Come on over
I like the way that she treat me, gon leave you won't leave me, I'm callin that casanova
She said I'm insane yeah
I might blow my brain out
Xanny numb the pain yeah
Please, Xanny make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted but it keep controlling me
All that pain now I can't feel it, I swear that it's slowing me (yeah)

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said I am not afraid to, die
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead (yeah)
All my friends are dead (yeah)

That is not your swag I swear you faking
Young nigga wanna take my cake now
Radar, at the store, radar
Made some, look nigga take some
Fast car, Nascar, race on
In the club they got no 1s we were baked now
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes, you is not a G though
Look at you stackin' all your money, it ain't green though
I was counting that and its not 20, that's a G bruh

She said
You're the worst, you're the worst
I cannot die, nigga this my universe

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said baby I am not afraid to, die
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
