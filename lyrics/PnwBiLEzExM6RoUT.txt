A gypsy wind is blowing warm tonight
The sky is starlit and the time is right
And still you're tellin' me you have to go
Before you leave there's something you should know
Yeah, something you should know babe

I've seen you smilin' in the summer sun
I've seen your long hair flyin' when you run
I've made my mind up that it's meant to be
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Out where the rivers meet the sound and sea
You're high above me now, you're wild and free, ah but
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me, yeah

Some people say that love's a losin' game
You start with fire but you lose the flame
The ashes smolder but the warmth's soon gone
You end up cold and lonely on your own

I'll take my chances babe I'II risk it all
I'll win your love or I'II take the fall
I've made my mind up girl it's meant to be
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
It's written down, somewhere it's got to be
You're high above me flyin' wild and free
Oh, but someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Out where the rivers meet the sound and sea
I feel it in my soul, it's meant to be
Oh someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

You will accomp'ny me, yeah (Ooh-oh, you'll accompany)
I know you will accomp'ny me (Ooh-oh)
Ooh (Ooh-oh, you'll accompany)
Someday lady (Ooh-oh)
Someday lady (Ooh-oh, you'll accompany)
You're gonna accomp'ny me, now (Ooh-oh)
You're gonna walk with me and talk with me, yeah (Ooh-oh you'll accompany, ooh-oh)
Ooh (Ooh-oh, you'll accompany, ooh-oh)
Yeah (Ooh-oh, you'll accompany)
Gonna accomp'ny me (Ooh-oh)
Gonna accomp'ny me, yeah (Ooh-oh, you'll accompany)
Someday (Ooh-oh)
