There is no sound
I saw you drown
Brace for the silence rain
Ghost live inside my floor

Munelted, revolted
It didn't make much sense to me
If I could, would have told you
That you are not alone

Floating around in the atmosphere
I was sure I saw you when you where here
But it's just a memory

If I could change
Make it the same
Just like it used to be
We would stay seventeen

Munelted, revolted
It didn't make much sense to me
If I could, would have told you
That you are not alone

Floating around in the atmosphere
I was sure I saw you when you where here
But it's just a memory

Floating around in the atmosphere
I was sure I saw you when you where here
But it's just a memory

I'm screaming things out if you can hear
I was shooked when I saw you when you where hit
But it's just a memory
