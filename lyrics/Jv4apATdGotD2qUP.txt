I'll do anything you want me to,
do
I'm getting off because I'm being used,
by you
We could do anything you wanted to,
do
We could do anything you wanna do

Oooh get up get ready
Oooh get up get ready
Oooh get up get ready
Get ready, get ready

For a heart attack
Heart attack
It's a heart attack
Heart attack

Can't wait my turn, my fear is looming
My thoughts get lost, the air is putrid
You can do anything you wanna do
do
You can do anything you wanna do

(Useless)

Oooh get up get ready
Oooh get up get ready
Oooh get up get ready
Get ready, get ready

Oooh get up get ready
Oooh get up get ready
Oooh get up get ready
Get ready, get ready

For a heart attack
Heart attack
It's a heart attack
Heart attack
