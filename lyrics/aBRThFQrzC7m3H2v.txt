Sitting home alone
Thinkin' about
My past
Wonderin' how
I made it
And how long
It's gonna last
Success
Has come
To lots of them
Failure's
Always there
Time, time
Waits for no one
And I wish
How I wish
Someone would care
Yeah

Some folks
Think you're happy
When you wear
Your smile
But what about
Your tribulations
And all
All of your trials?
Smiles, smiles
Hide a lots a things
The good
The bad
The hurt
All of this goes too

And I wish, I wish
How I wish
Someone would care
I wish
Someone would care
Don't you think
Someone should care?
Ah
Don't you need
Someone to care?
Sit down and think
About yourself
