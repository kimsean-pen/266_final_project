Intelligent people have, had their say
It's time for the foolish to show the way
Let's lead this world a merry dance
Let's give stupidity a chance

We've heard quite enough
Of experts and their dealings
Why face the facts when you can just feel the feelings?
Let's lead this world a merry dance
Let's give stupidity a chance

Forget political correctness, I mean W-T-F
I don't wanna think about the world
I wanna talk about myself

Instead of governing with thoughtful sensitivity
Let's shock and awe the world with idiotic bigotry
Let's lead this world a merry dance
And give stupidity a chance

You say corruption, I say justified reward
Keeps the cronies loyal chairmen of the board
Let's lead this world a merry dance
And give stupidity a chance

Forget political correctness
Let's talk man to man
Chicks are always up for it
You gotta grab whatever you can

We need a leader who knows that money means class
With an eye for a peach-perfect piece of *ss
Not a total dumb-cluck just one of the guys
Let's give stupidity a prize

Let's lead this world a merry dance
And give stupidity a chance
Let's give stupidity a chance
