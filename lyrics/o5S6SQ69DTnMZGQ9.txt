Incipe memoriam
Incipe abicere
Desiste ab memoria
Let me go numb
Omitte nunc dolores
Quid agis nihil moror
Retineri non possum
Let me go numb

You were so good a liar
And I was so in love
That I invited in the pain

I had to learn with fire
After a flame is snuffed
Only the ashes still remain

Now that I finally see you
As you are
Must I be forced to see you
In every scar?

Incipe memoriam
Incipe abicere
Desiste ab memoria
Let me go numb
Omitte nunc dolores
Quid agis nihil moror
Retineri non possum
Let me go numb

Practicing blackest magic
You cast a spell on me
That even today is hard to break

While it was turning tragic
Part of me stayed deceived
Part of me clung to my mistake

Now that I finally see you
As you are
Must I be forced to see you
In every scar?

Incipe memoriam
Incipe abicere
Desiste ab memoria
Let me go numb
Omitte nunc dolores
Quid agis nihil moror
Retineri non possum
Let me go numb

If I'm to survive
Make a new life
I need to become
Totally numb

Now that I finally see you
As you are
Must I be forced to see you
In every scar?

Now that I finally see you
As you are
Must I be forced to see you
In every scar?

Incipe memoriam
Incipe abicere
Desiste ab memoria
Let me go numb
Omitte nunc dolores
Quid agis nihil moror
Retineri non possum
Let me go numb
