Hot, blue and righteous
An angel called me aside
Hot, blue and righteous
Said, "Stick by me and I'll be your guide tonight"

I heard the words as I closed my eyes
Down on my, down on my bended knees
It fit like a glove and I realized
Somethin' good's happenin' to me

Hot, blue and righteous
An angel called me aside
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
