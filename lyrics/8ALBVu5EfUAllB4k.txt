The light was leaving in the west it was blue
The children's laughter sang
Skipping just like the stones they threw
Their voices echoed across the waves
It's getting late

It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise
Not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
We listened to Papa's translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations

The west winds often last too long
And when they calm down
Nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree
Waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea
Of stars up above us chasing the day away
A way to find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough and all else fades
Fades away

It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise
Not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
Listen to all translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations
