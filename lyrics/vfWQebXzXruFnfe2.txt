I fell straight
Into your arms
Like a drunk
Who's been on it
All morning.
And the sun's up
And my head's fucked.

And immediately I grabbed you
You go all red
Like the first time
I love it when you do that
Gotta love it when you do that.

I remember when we
Swapped names and I thought maybe
You'd stay and try to out-drink me
Your friends, all hate it!

Fuck'em if they talk
Fuck'em if they trying get to us
Cause I rather go blind
Than let you down.

Our cocoon
On your shoulders
When you're half cut
And you're frozen
And you've got that little mood grieving
You're depending on me again.

I remember when we
Swapped names and I thought maybe
You'd stay and try to out-drink me
Your friends, all hate it!

Fuck'em if they talk
Fuck'em if they trying get to us
Cause I rather go blind
Than let you down.

Fuck'em if they talk
Fuck'em if they trying get to us
Cause I rather go blind
Than let you down.

And if you wanna track down and pose as positive
Cops won't kill from relatives
Rest on me,
Honey, that's all right!
And if you wanna act more drunk than usual
To help you get away with more than
Rest on me,
Honey, that's all right!
Honey, that's all right!

Our cocoon
Shrug your shoulders
And I'm good
Damn good

Fuck'em if they talk
Fuck'em if they trying get to us
'Cause I rather go blind
Than let you down.

I remember when we
Swapped names and I thought maybe
You'd stay and try to out-drink me
Your friends, all hate it!
