No one can hear you scream
Don't ever fall asleep
He'll pull you underneath
You're dying in your dream

He's closing in and you can't get out
But you can't give in
Just please don't go
Up the walls, up the walls

No one can hear you scream
Don't ever fall asleep
He'll pull you underneath
You're dying in your dream
Just open, open your eyes one last time
No one can hear you scream
You're dying in your dream

Doll up as if you were dying
This isn't real, you are not real
Doll up, your friends have been waiting
This isn't real, I cannot go
Up the walls, up the walls

No one can hear you scream
Don't ever fall asleep
He'll pull you underneath
You're dying in your dream
Just open, open your eyes one last time
No one can hear you scream
You're dying in your dream

Rest your eyes
I have been waiting, always waiting
If you don't wake up screaming
Then you won't wake up at all
If yon don't wake up screaming
Then you won't wake up at all

No one can hear you scream
Don't ever fall asleep
He'll pull you underneath
You're dying in your dream
Just open, open your eyes one last time
No one can hear you scream
You're dying in your dream
