Open up my eyes and feel your hearbeat
As we lay with your body pressed against mine
And I know, and I know this very moment
This will be, this will be till the end of time
I want you to know

This love is more than chemical
It feels unusual
And I can't get enough
You know-oh-oh
This love is more than chemical
And we're unbreakable
Oh be forevermore
More than chemical

Every time the darkness falls around me
I can feel you move beneath my skin
Eh and
Something strange is happening inside me
Don't know where you end and I begin
I want you to know

This love is more than chemical
It feels unusual
And I can't get enough
You know-oh-oh
This love is more than chemical
And we're unbreakable
Oh be forevermore
More than chemical

More than chemical
