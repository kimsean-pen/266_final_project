I'm so glad you're awake, that you're not like the others
'Cause they're so straight-laced, they're no fun
Gosh that's nice, that lingerie
Makes me feel like, oh I don't know

You're a very pretty thing
You remind me of someone
You must have heard
Some awful nasty things about me, but

What I can do for you
There's no one else on God's green earth can do
What I can do for you
There's no one else on God's green earth can do

Just ask anybody
They'll tell you that it's true
There's no one else on earth
Can do the things that I can do for you

For you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you, for you

You're never gonna make it all by yourself
You're gonna need a friend, you're gonna need my help
I have so much to offer if you'd just be nice
If you do what I say and don't make me say it twice

Do you mind if I just rub my hand up thus?
Come on just my hand, come on just my hand
You gotta understand, I'm gonna be your man
I'm gonna be your man, you're gonna need me

I'm gonna make you understand
Yeah I'm gonna be your man
I'm gonna be, gonna be your man

What I can do for you
There's no one else on God's green earth can do
What I can do for you
There's no one else on God's green earth can do

Just ask anybody
They'll tell you that it's true
There's no one else on earth
Can do the things that I can do for you

For you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
No one else on earth
(For you, for you, for you, for you)
Can do those things
(For you, for you, for you, for you)
I can do, I can do for you
(For you, for you, for you, for you)
For you, for you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you, for you

Come on, just my hand
(For you, for you, for you, for you)
You gotta understand, I'm gonna be your man
(For you, for you, for you, for you)
Be your man
(For you, for you, for you, for you)
For you, for you, for you, for you
