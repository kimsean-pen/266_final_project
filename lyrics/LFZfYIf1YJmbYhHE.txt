Can you tell me what's on your mind?
And would it help if I shared with you mine?

'Cause I've been thinking
Have you been thinking?
Things haven't been alright
'Cause I've been thinking
Have you been thinking?

If you bottle everything to say something
Then that won't tell me anything
Give me space to breathe
Let me in to see
Set your troubles free

Define the fine line

It's been another sleepless night
And we're never really sure why

'Cause I've been thinking
Have you been thinking?
Things haven't been alright
'Cause I've been thinking
Have you been thinking?

If you bottle everything to say something
Then that won't tell me anything
Give me space to breathe
Let me in to see
Set your troubles free

Use your eyes to see everything's okay
Put your trust in me

Gotta find the fine line between what is wrong
But what is wrong? I know how
I know how (to find the fine line)
Gotta find the fine line between what is wrong
But what is right?
I know how
But I know how (to find the fine line)

To find the fine line
I know now (to find the fine line)
