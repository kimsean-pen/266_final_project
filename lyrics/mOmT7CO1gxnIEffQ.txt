Oh Mother say a prayer for me
Jesse's back in town, it won't be easy
Don't let him near me, don't let him touch me
Don't let him tease me

Jesse, I won't cut fresh flowers for you
No Jesse, and I won't make the wine cold for you
No Jesse, I won't change the sheets for you
I won't put on cologne, I won't sit by the phone for you

Annie, keep reminding me that he cut out my heart
Like a paper doll
Sally, tell me once again how he set me up
Just to see me fall

Jesse, I won't cut fresh flowers for you
No Jesse, I won't make the wine cold for you
No Jesse, I won't change the sheets for you
I won't put on cologne, I won't sit by the phone for you
No, no, no

Jesse, quick come here, I won't tell a soul
(Not even myself)
Jesse, that you've come back to me, my friends will all say
(She's gone again)
But how can anyone know what you are to me
That I'm in heaven again
Because you've come back to me
Ooooh
Jesse

Jesse, I'll always cut fresh flowers for you
And Jesse, I'll always make the wine cold for you
Oh Jesse, I can easily change my mind about you
And put on cologne, and sit by the phone for you
Oh yeah

Jesse
Lets open the wine
And drink to the heart
Which has a will of it's own
My friends (My friends)
Let's comfort them
They're feeling bad
They think I've sunk so low

Jesse, I always cut fresh flowers for you
And Jesse, I will make the wine cold for you
Oh Jesse, I will change the sheets for you
Put on cologne and I will wait by the phone for you
Oh, Jesse
(La la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la)
Oh Jesse
(La la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la)
Jesse, I will cut fresh flowers for you
And Jesse, yeah, make the wine cold for you
Oh Jesse, and I will change the sheets for you
