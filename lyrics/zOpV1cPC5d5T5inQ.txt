We live in shine and shade
And trust the bittersweet
But a fool who doesn't see
How precious life can be

Each triumph has a lonely side
We're always facing black and white
We're heading for the bittersweet
Each curtain call a daring deed

A way to go, can be a way to fall
We might lose it when we want it all
We're living in the shine and shade
We're swaying between love and hate

Ohhh, let a child be a child
Before the seed is sown

A disharmonic harmony
Completing our symphony
More can be more or can be less
No difference between life and death

Ohhh, let a child be a child
Before the seed is sown

Don't waste it onto barren land

We're gonna shine on
In the light that has set us free
Anyway we're gonna shine on
Shine on, shine on
In a land that we've never seen
Anyway we're gonna shine on
Shine on, shine on

We live in shine and shade
And trust the bittersweet
But a fool who doesn't see
How precious life can be

We're hoping for the best to come
And forget about what we have done
Forget about what we achieved
The fortunes and the miseries

We live a lonely life together
Close and yet so far forever
Along the way we see it all
We know the rise
We know the fall

Ohhh, let a child be a child
Before the seed is sown

Don't waste it onto barren land

We're gonna shine on
In the light that has set us free
Anyway we're gonna shine on
Shine on, shine on
In a land that we've never seen
Anyway we're gonna shine on
Shine on, shine on

We live in shine and shade
And trust the bittersweet
But a fool who doesn't see
How precious life can be and love's divine

Don't waste it onto barren land

We're gonna shine on
In the light that has set us free
Anyway we're gonna shine on
Shine on, shine on
In a land that we've never seen
Anyway we're gonna shine on
Shine on, shine on

We're gonna shine on
In the light that has set us free
Anyway we're gonna shine on
Shine on, shine on
In a land that we've never seen
Anyway we're gonna shine on
Shine on, shine on

We live in shine and shade
