Me and my Arrow
Straighter than narrow
Wherever we go
Everyone knows
It's me and my Arrow

Me and my Arrow
Taking the high road
Wherever we go
Everyone knows
It's me and my Arrow

And in the morning when I wake up
She may be gone, I don't know
And if we make up just to break up
I'll carry on, oh yes I will

Me and my Arrow
(Doodle-dee-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
Straighter than narrow
Wherever we go
Everyone knows
It's me and my Arrow

Me and my Arrow
Me and my Arrow
Me and my Arrow
Me and my Arrow
Me and my Arrow

Me and my Arrow
(Doodle-dee-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
Straighter than narrow
Wherever we go
Everyone knows
It's me and my Arrow
