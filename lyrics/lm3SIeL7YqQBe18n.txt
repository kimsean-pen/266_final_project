He's a Japanese boy

He said that he loved me, never would go
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Now I find I'm sitting here on my own
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Was it something I've said or done
That made him pack his bags up and run?
Could it be another he's found?
It's breaking up the happy home

Mister, can you tell me where my love has gone?
He's a Japanese boy
I woke up one morning and my love was gone
Oh, my Japanese boy
Ooh, I miss my Japanese boy

People ask about him every day
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Don't know what to tell them, what can I say?
Oh-oh, oh-oh

If only he would write me or call
A word of explanation, that's all
It would stop me climbing the wall
It's breaking up the happy home

Mister, can you tell me where my love has gone?
He's a Japanese boy
I woke up one morning and my love was gone
Oh, my Japanese
Miss my Japanese
Oh, my Japanese boy

Was it something I've said or done
That made him pack his bags up and run?
Could it be another he's found?
It's breaking up the happy home

Mister, can you tell me where my love has gone?
He's a Japanese boy
I woke up once morning and my love was gone
Oh, my Japanese boy
Ooh, I miss my Japanese boy
