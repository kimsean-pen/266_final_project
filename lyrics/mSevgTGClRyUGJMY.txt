Next Thursday you're invited to watch Rising Tide's live coverage
of a gala tribute
in salute to Ronald Reagan.
Host Haley Barbour joins special guest lady Margaret Thatcher
in celebrating the former president's 83 birthday.
Ticket's are 1000 Dollars a plate but you can see the event free on GOP TV
Images of perfection, suntan and napalm
Grenada - haiti - poland - nicaragua
Who shall we choose for our morality?
I'm thinking right now of hollywood tragedy
Big mac: smack: phoenix r: please smile y'all
Cuba, mexico can't cauterize our discipline
Your idols speak so much of the abyss
Yet your morals only run as deep as the surface

(If white) Cool - groovy - morning - fine
(America) Tipper Gore was a friend of mine
(told thw truth) I love a free country
(for one day) The stars and stripes and an apple for mommy

Conservative say: There ain't no black in the union jack
Democrat say: There ain't enough white in the stars and stripes

Compton - harlem - a pimp fucked a priest
The white man has just found a new moral saviour
Vital stats - how white was their skin
Unimportant- just another inner-city drive-by thing
Morning - fine - serve your first coffee of the day
Real privilege, it will take your problems all away
Number one - the best - no excuse from me
I am here to serve the moral majority

(If white) Cool - groovy - morning - fine
(America) Tipper Gore was a friend of mine
(told the truth) I love a free country
(for one day) The stars and stripes and an apple for mommy

Zapruder the first to masturbate
The world's first taste of crucified grace
And we say: There's not enough black in the union jack
And we say: There's too much white in the stars and stripes

Fuck the brady bill
Fuck the brady bill
If God made man they say
Sam Colt made him equal.
