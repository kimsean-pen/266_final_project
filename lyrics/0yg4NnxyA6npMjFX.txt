Back off loneliness and hello tenderness
I've been waiting for your call for so long
And it must've been hard just to follow your soul
To stick to the road that your heart wants you to go

And as you slide through the door with your morals on your sleeve
And I think it's time for all those morals to leave
So let's get down and freaky baby, let's get restless baby
C'mon get crazy with me and I said

When you're loving me I'm loving you
And I love the prowess and the things that you do
And it's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
And when you're loving me I'm loving you
And that's when we've got it goin' on, yeah oh

So many people think we've got it wrong
They'll try to break us but we won't play along
So let's get down and dirty baby, let's get restless baby
C'mon get crazy with me and I said

When you're loving me I'm loving you
And I love the prowess and the things that you do
And it's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
And when you're loving me I'm loving you
And that's when we've got it goin' on, oh goin' on

And I was so stranded, I was lost and abandoned, yeah
And I needed another home
And you flew in my arms, you just flew right into my arms

And when you're loving me I'm loving you
And I love the prowess and the things that you do
And it's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
And when you're loving me I'm loving you
And that's when we've got it goin' on

When you're loving me I'm loving you
And I love the prowess and all the things that you do
And it's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
And when you're loving me I'm loving you
And that's when we've got it goin' on
On and on, on and

It's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
When you're loving me I'm loving you
And that's when we've got it goin' on
