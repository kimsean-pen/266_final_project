And I know you have your reasons, but I

I'm just moving, moving on
And you can't change how you're feeling

I need to give my love to someone new

You know that I want to, believe that's true
I know the words you're saying
You know that I need to, believe that's true
And I know you have your reasons, but I

I won't change with the seasons
I'm just moving, moving on
And you can't change how you're feeling
I should've know
