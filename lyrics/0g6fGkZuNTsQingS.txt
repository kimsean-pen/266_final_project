Enemies of Khanate strung on hooks
Like pigs to slaughter, heads will roll
Heads will roll, throats will be slit
Blood will flow like springs of water
Heads will roll to the River Red
(Across the ochre steppe)

A thousand fathers killed
A thousand virgin daughters spread
With swords still wet, with swords still wet
With the blood of their dead

Now, Jin is upon us, he kills in silence after prayers
Genghis Khan is upon us, he slays his betrayers
Genghis Khan is upon us, he slays his betrayers
Thus still the fools of God will guard the city of our birth
Hold an ear to the ground, yeah, hear the sound
Clamoring and horses stammer as their gallop meets the earth

A thousand fathers killed
A thousand virgin daughters spread
With swords still wet, with swords still wet
With the blood of their dead

A thousand fathers killed
A thousand virgin daughters spread
With swords still wet, with swords still wet
With the blood of their dead

(Tomorrow they will find us)
Hide the children free of sin
(We will meet their blades by morning)
Protected only by your skin
Tomorrow we will find them
(Seek the youngest of their kin)
And we will meet them with our fury

And we will crush them all like vermin
We will crush them all like vermin
