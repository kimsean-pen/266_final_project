it's amazing what you'll find when you just open your eyes
sometimes love can leave you blind
but still you try to cover all the lies and ignore all the signs
sometimes love can leave you blind

what i thought was a certainty
has left me
spinning in circles again

comparing to the last time that we had spoke it seems to
me that youre not happy like you used to be

to you i'm like a flavor that wouldn't last
you took one bite than spat me out real fast

and now this mark remains and will never ever go away
and now this mark remains and will never ever go away
and now this mark remains and will never ever go away
