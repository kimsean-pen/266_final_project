Are you ready for the time of your life?
It's time to stand up and fight
Hand in hand we'll take a carvan to the motherland

One by one we gonna stand up with pride,
One that can't be denied
Now the children of the world can see
There's a better place for us to be!
The place in which we were born,
So neglected and torn apart

Every woman, every man join the carvan of love
Stand up!
Everybody take a stand, join the carvan of love
Stand up!
He's my brother
He's my brother
Don't you know?!
I'm your sister
I'm your sister
Don't you know?!
Uuh uuh

We'll be living in a world of peace
And the day when everyone is free
We'll bring the young and the old
Won't you let your love flow from your heart?

Every woman, every man join the carvan of love
Stand up!
Everybody take a stand, join the carvan of love
Stand up!
He's my brother
He's my brother
Don't you know?!
I'm your sister
I'm your sister
Don't you know?!

Every woman, every man join the carvan of love
Stand up!
