You thought I wouldn't come around to you, round to you
You know I was down for you, down for you
Now I'm wishin' that I neva bowed to you, bowed to you

I'm in this shit I can't get out of, I'm not proud of
Hate the sound of all these sounds bout you, songs bout u
Ya know I was wrong bout you, wrong bout you
Let you hold on to this cash, let you hold on to

I'm in this shit I can't get out of, I ain't proud of

I'm runnin' outta time to hold you close
Runnin' outta time to be your man
I'm just lost in this moment
I'm just zonin'
I'm runnin' outta time to hold you down
Runnin' outta time to be your man
I'm just lost in this moment
I've been zonin
You know that I could get you more, a lil more
Whateva you need, whacha need

You know that I could get you more, a lil more
Whateva you need

You found I wouldn't come around to you, round to you
You know I was down for you, down for you
Now I'm wishin' that I neva bowed to you, bowed to you
I'm in this shit I can't get out of, I'm not proud of
Hate the sound of all these sounds bout you, songs bout u

Ya know I was wrong bout you, wrong bout you
Let you hold on to this cash, let you hold on to
I'm in this shit I can't get out of, I ain't proud of

I'm runnin' outta time to hold you close
Runnin' outta time to be your man
I'm just lost in this moment
I've been zonin
I'm runnin' outta time to hold you down
Runnin' outta time to be your man
I'm just lost in this moment
I've been zonin'
