Crave is admitted to both
Flows to the surface
Don't be a fool
Don't be a fool

Climb out the window again
Slipped on the water
Don't be a fool
Don't be a fool

If only for justice
If only for her
Don't be a fool
Don't be a fool

Give away that card
And take all that I've got
Don't let me wander
Don't let me wander

If only for justice
If only for her
Don't be a fool
Don't be a fool

Give away that card
And take all that I've got
Don't let me wander
Don't let me wander
