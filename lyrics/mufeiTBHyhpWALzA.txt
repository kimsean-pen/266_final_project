On the seven seas, there was a phantom ship a-comin'
Shinin' on the dead of night, I heard the crew a-hummin'
Tunes that sounded like the Rolling Stones and Leonard Cohen
But they didn't know the words, so I assumed that they was foreign

But I heard them just the same
Oh, doctor, let me teach 'em, I just wanna please them now
I said, doctor, let me teach 'em, I just wanna please them now

I looked up in the sky, there was a phantom plane a-comin'
Shinin' in the dead of night, I heard the pilot saying
Poems that were written by John Keats and Robert Browning
He didn't know the words, so I suppose that it was nothing

But I heard them just the same
Oh, doctor, let me teach 'em, I just wanna please them now
I said, doctor, let me teach 'em, I just wanna please them now

Oh, doctor, please believe me, I know you won't deceive me
But do these things I'm seein' have any hidden meaning?
It's all good entertainment, it doesn't cost a penny
So please, doc, let me teach 'em, if I could only reach 'em

But I heard them just the same
Oh, doctor, let me teach 'em, I just wanna please them now
Oh, doctor, let me teach 'em, I just wanna please them now
