I need your sweet inspiration
I need you here on my mind every hour of the day
Without your sweet inspiration
The lonely hours of the night just don't go my way

A man in love needs sweet inspiration
And honey that's all I ask, that's all I ask from you
I gotta have sweet inspiration
You know there's just no telling what a satisfied man might do

If I'm out in the rain baby
In a bad situation
I just reach back in my mind to find
Sweet, sweet inspiration

Sweet, oh what a power
And I've got the power
Every hour in the day
I need your sweet inspiration
To go on livin' to keep on givin' this way

Sweet, sweet inspiration
Sweet, sweet inspiration
Sweet, sweet inspiration
Sweet, sweet inspiration
Sweet, sweet inspiration
Sweet, sweet inspiration
Sweet, sweet inspiration (oh, yeah)
Sweet, sweet inspiration
Sweet, sweet
