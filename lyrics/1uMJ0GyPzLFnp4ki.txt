Well, I've wondered around after hour of words
And I'm waiting in vain here for weeks
The ghost of the girlfriend is here in my room
I can still smell her perfume in my sheets
But that's not her in my bed
Though she's out of the town
And I don't want anyone to see
There's a tattoo of my name on her body but honestly
The man holding her hand isn't me
Oh honey how could you regret me when you can't even forget me?
But it's OK (ok)
To say that you love me (love me)
I think of you (all night long)
Still think of you (all night long)
Oh it's OK (ok)
Say that you love me (love me)
I think of you (all night long)
Still thinking of you (all night long)

I thought that once you had one
You had every woman
Until I lost this legendary woman (now I'm sure)
Now I'm sure
That they don't make 'em like her anymore
So please! baby, please! love
Let's find a way to forgive each other
I got out of hand ever since you've been gone

Without you I'm still alone

Oh how could you regret me when you know you can't forget me?
But it's OK (ok)
To say that you love me (love me)
I think of you (all night long)
Still think of you (all night long)
Oh OK (ok)
Say that you love me (love me)
I think of you (all night long)
Still thinking of you (all night long)
I make mistakes, I'm only human

And I am not ashamed to say
That you... are the one!

But it's OK (ok)
To say that you love me (love me)
I think of you (all night long)
Still think of you (all night long)
But it's OK (ok)

To say that you love me (love me)
I think of you (all night long)
Still think of you (all night long)

It's OK (ok)
...(love me)
Oh (all night long)
Say that you love me (all night long)
Say you love me...
