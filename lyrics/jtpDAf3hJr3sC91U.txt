White bird with a black tail
Eyes dark and face so pale
Do you know what your future holds?
Over your side of the road

White bird with a black tail
You look like an open sail
Made me look up from my shoes
To show me what you stand to lose

White bird, white bird
With your face so pale
White bird, white bird
Where'd you get that tail?
White bird, white bird
With a black tail

White feathers dipped in tar
It's hard to tell how old you are
Wonderin' how much you know
About all of us below

Half of you is heavenly
Showin' off your purity
The rest of you is from the stream
Like a land where they both meet

White bird, white bird
With your face so pale
White bird, white bird
Where'd you get that tail?

White bird, white bird
With your face so pale
White bird, white bird
With a black tail
