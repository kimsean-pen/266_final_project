With the walk (walk) and the talk (talk)
And the tick-tock clock (clock)
With the rock (rock) and the roll (roll)
And the bridge (bridge) and the toll (toll)
With the brilliance (brilliance) and the light (light)
And the stink (stink) and the hype (hype)
And the road ahead of you

I cannot tell a lie
It's not all cherry pie
But it's all there waiting for you
Yeah you

Hey Yeah!
Hey Yeah!
Hey Yeah!
I know

With the warp (warp) and the wooze (wooze)
And the subterfuge (fuge)
Does it all look bitter and blue?

While I'm nothing but confused (confused)
With nothing left to lose (lose)
And if you buy that
I've got a bridge for you

Hey Yeah! (Hey Yeah!)
Hey Yeah! (Hey Yeah!)
Hey Yeah!
I know

Hey Yeah! (Hey Yeah!)
Hey Yeah! (Hey Yeah!)
Hey Yeah!
I know

Ohoho
Ohoho
Ohoho
Ohoho

Every day is new again
Every day is yours to win
And that's how heroes are made
I wanted (I wanted) to win (to win)
So I'd said it again
That's how heroes are made

Hey Yeah! (Hey Yeah!)
Hey Yeah! (Hey Yeah!)
Hey Yeah!
I know

Hey Yeah! (Hey Yeah!)
Hey Yeah! (Hey Yeah!)
Hey Yeah!
I know

Ah...
