We're gonna rock, we're gonna roll
We're gonna rock this joint tonight

Tear down the mailbox, rip up the floor
Smash out the windows and knock down the door

We're gonna rock, rock this joint
We're gonna rock, rock this joint
We're gonna rock, rock this joint
We're gonna rock this joint tonight

Well, six times six is thirty six
I ain't gonna hit for six more licks

We're gonna rock
(Hey rock)
Rock this joint
We're gonna rock
(Hey rock)
Rock this joint

We're gonna rock
(Hey rock)
Rock this joint

Do the beetle-bop right, side by side
Flying low and flying wide

We're gonna rock
(Hey rock)
Rock this joint
We're gonna rock
(Hey rock)
Rock this joint

We're gonna rock
(Hey rock)
Rock this joint
We're gonna rock this joint tonight

Well, seven times five is thirty-five
Man-oh-man-oh-man alive!

We're gonna rock
(Hey rock)
Rock this joint
We're gonna rock
(Hey rock)
Rock this joint

We're gonna rock
(Hey rock)
Rock this joint
We're gonna rock this joint tonight

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Well, little boy blue, come blow your horn
The cat's in the meadow, gonna rock till morn'

We're gonna rock
(Hey rock)

We're gonna rock
(Hey rock)
Rock this joint

We're gonna rock
(Hey rock)
Rock this joint
