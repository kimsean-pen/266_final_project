There's a cause to light my call
And when I speak
There's a fire underneath
But I won't divulge it all
I know that line
I will cross or hide behind

Want, need for my all
Let me breathe

When time outruns my soul
I don't have to hide
Fear is not my guide
I won't be made to hold
Any word inside
Fear is not my guide

I will not rescind a word
Of what I've said
For the vultures overhead
But for every line I vent
Another ten
I'm afraid I'd lose you then

As I learn to count my days
The less I care to veil
Something of a deeper truth
Is begging to exhale

When the time has come to bleed
And air my fill
Will you be there for me still
And if you turn and walk away
Well then I know
You were never there at all

When time outruns my soul
Fear is not my guide
Death is on my side
