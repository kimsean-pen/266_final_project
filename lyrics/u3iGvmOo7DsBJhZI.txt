Talking away
I don't know what
I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today is another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay?

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But that's me I'm
Stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry and

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

And all things that you say
Is it a life or
Just to play
My worries away
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two
I'll be gone
In a day or two
In a day or two
