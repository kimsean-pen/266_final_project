I can feel the sunlight on my skin
An unexpected feeling
I still wonder
How you bring all of the colors in everything
Cause you're so smooth
The way you do it
Got me really feenin' for your vibe (every night)
Don't know how I got into it
But I haven't felt this in a while (in a while)
Floating through a sunset
We're just taking our time
With you I'm flying
It feels like butterflies
We're lost in love
It's just you and I
Under the honey skies
You feel like summertime
There's nothing I need
When you hold me at ease
You've been waiting patiently
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Floating through a sunset
We're just taking our time
With you I'm flying
It feels like butterflies
We're lost in love
It's just you and I
Under the honey skies
You feel like summertime
We'll stay intertwined
Locked in these arms of mine
I'll be down for life
Floating through a sunset
We're just taking our time
With you I'm flying
It feels like butterflies
We're lost in love
It's just you and I
Under the honey skies
You feel like summertime
Floating through a sunset
With you I'm flying
It feels like butterflies
We're lost in love, yeah (just you and I)
Under the honey skies
You feel like summertime
