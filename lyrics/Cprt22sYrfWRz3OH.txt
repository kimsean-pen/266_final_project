Sweet caress
Grazes my skin
It's loveless
These hooks sink in
Behind an angel's disguise
An insect preys
Mandibles cut like a knife
The reckoning

Forming clouds, their shadow shrouds
Louder the tattered wings they sound
Descending
Down they come, the swarm of locust
Skies above converge to choke us
Feast of souls, consume the harvest
Young and old
Suffer unto the locust

Surrender
These veins are bled
Devoured
Nothing sacred
Strings pull the marionettes
See how they dance
Upon the winds that beget
Our pestilence

Forming clouds, their shadow shrouds
Louder the tattered wings they sound
Descending
Down they come, the swarm of locust
Skies above converge to choke us
Feast of souls, consume the harvest
Young and old
Suffer unto the locust

Bleeding from my eyes
This plague is sent to erase us
Bleeding from inside
These vermin can't infiltrate us
Faith appears and holds a candle
Hark the angels sing

Forming clouds, their shadow shrouds
Louder the tattered wings they sound
Tear the veil, the lies derail
Purity ever will prevail
Trumpets sound the shattered crown
Halos of truth now they surround
The charade comes down

Down they come, the swarm of locust
Skies above converge to choke us
Feast of souls consume the harvest
Young and old suffer unto the locust
Down they come, the swarm of locust
Skies above converge to choke us
Feast of souls consume the harvest
Young and old
Suffer unto the locust
