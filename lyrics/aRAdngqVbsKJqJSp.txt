In my little town
I grew up believing
God keeps his eye on us all
And he used to lean upon me
As I pledged allegiance to the wall
Lord, I recall my little town
Comin' home after school

Flyin' my bike past the gates of the factories
My mom doin' the laundry
Hangin' our shirts in the dirty breeze
And after it rains, there's a rainbow
And all of the colors are black
It's not that the colors aren't there

It's just imagination they lack
Everything's the same back in my little town (my little town)
Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town
In my little town
I never meant nothin', I was just my fathers son
Savin' my money
Dreamin' of glory
Twitchin' like a finger on the trigger of a gun
Leaving nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town

Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town
