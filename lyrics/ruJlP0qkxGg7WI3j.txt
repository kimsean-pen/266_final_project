When last did you go to Baccanalia? He seems to have seen you there
You know the one who puts me in hysteria.
And makes me behave like a cur
You know the one who would shame me
In matters of loin
And make me believe that I've been alone
In some hopeless void
You know the one mnxim
Come on
You know the one
I am in love
I'm an Interloper

I am in love
I'm no Interloper
Good Lord I see him now

Tell me what happened
The opium of your word
Let me put my finger in the carven of his mouth
I am in love
I'm an Interloper
I am in love
I'm no interloper
Good Lord I see him now

Who did you love in Cacchanalia?
Do you think they would have loved you too?
Now those boys smile when they see ya
I guess it's something I should get accustomed to ooh
Something I should do
Do you see them now?
Do you see them now?
Did they suddenly appear for what they were
Hmmm
Baby
There's something in your mouth
I am in love
I'm an interloper
I am in love
I'm no Interloper
Oh! Do you see them now?
In everything I look for a sign
In the birds of the blue of the sky
