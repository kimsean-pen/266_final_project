My eyes are delusional
And I'm not thinking the same
But I've been wondering:
Is it me you're looking for?

Well you'll find me standing on these cold streets
Hoping that you're looking for a little bit more
Will you catch me, save me when I'm falling?
Tell me have you ever been here before?

So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage, find your lion
And take your pride and leave the past
Set sails for new horizons

So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage and find your lion
And if you hear the angels sing
Sweet Hallelujah
Hallelujah

So many faces telling the story
Like once upon a time
Blinded by the force of falling in love or
Leaving it all behind... but
The fear of the unknown, and who to follow
Leaves me howling at the skies

Is there a purpose in what we believe?
Well I will continue to wear my heart upon my sleeves

So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage, find your lion
And take your pride and leave the past
Set sails for new horizons

So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage, find your lion
And if you hear the angel sing
Sweet Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

So if you hear the angel sing
Sweet Hallelujah
Hallelujah
