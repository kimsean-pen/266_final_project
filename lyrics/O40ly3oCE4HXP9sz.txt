Over my dead body
The stars will let you know
It's over
Now if I had, my way
I would leave you here to waste your final days
Buried beneath
With the possibility of how things could be!
Oh please rest assured this was not my fault
And time is getting short
So I'll be here if you want me
Beaten and covered in a red so bloody!
Oh my darling can you hear?
My words so pure they burn your lying ears

And so the story goes
When I leave will you let me go?
When the words stop coming
And the fear starts setting in slow
Don't let me find you hiding under the covers
It's your last chance honey better
Call your mother!
All hope is lost down in the gutter

When you're in your bed
Sleeping toward the void
So deep it feels like death
Oh don't you wake wake
Oh my love I hear life holds nothing for us beyond our time in here
Oh don't you dare turn your back on me
No use running when the bad guy's coming!
Oh I think you've got me pegged as the wrong man
Oh I think you've got me pegged

And so the story goes
When I leave will you let me go?
When the words stop coming
And the fear starts setting in slow
Don't let me find you hiding under the covers
It's your last chance honey better
Call your mother!
All hope is lost down in the gutter

We were better together I know that much
Oh can't you see
Through the bad and the good we had all the luck
The devil's got nothing on us
You and me

Baby over my dead body
Baby over my dead body
Baby over my dead body
We're still counting on you
We'll keep counting on you
Mother come on out
Show me what the world is all about
We'll keep counting on you
Mother come on out
Show me what the world is all about

We'll keep fighting for you
We'll keep fighting for you
We'll keep fighting for you
We'll keep we'll keep fighting
Oh I think you've got me pegged as the wrong man
Oh I think you've got me pegged

And so the story goes
When I leave will you let me go?
When the words stop coming
And the fear starts setting in slow
Don't let me find you hiding under the covers
It's your last chance honey better
Call your mother!
All hope is lost down in the gutter
