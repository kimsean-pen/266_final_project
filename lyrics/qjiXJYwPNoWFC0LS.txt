We just go where the night is,
don't care what the wrong or the right is Don't care
if we ain't invited, we just go where the night is...
We just go where the night is,
don't care what the wrong or the right is Don't care
if we ain't invited, we just go where the night is...
Flying through the liquid sky like it's already gone Just trying to
remember what we even done White noise in a paradise gonna take us to
the sun Swimming 'till we see the night, t
he night just never comes We're swimming,
through the light We're flying through the liquid sky Just wanna stay
right here cos nothing ever stops Don't wanna leave here now but it's
all breaking up The only light that we saw was the light that came
from us We tried to dive until we saw those days above We're
swimming, through the light We're flying through the liquid sky
