Your speed is deadly
You've fallen out of time
Like you don't belong

It's a long way down, Icarus
You're heaven bound, Icarus
Can you make it back?

Up

The sky rips open
Or have you lost your mind?
Is being bad so wrong?

It's a long way down, Icarus
You're heaven bound, Icarus
Can you make it back?

Up
