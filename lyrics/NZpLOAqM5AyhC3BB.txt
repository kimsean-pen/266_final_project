Can you see to this harmony?
Can you let a quarter set you free?
This tonality, doesn't disagree
Ought to be chromatically pleasing me.

All that i want
Is some good loving
Musical thoughts.

I got to see, learn this history.
Pull another record from your sleeve.
A mystery, if you don't believe,
Slip another coin in my machine.

All that i want
Is some good listening
Musical pop,
The gift keeps giving,
Use what you got,
Not what you're missing.
