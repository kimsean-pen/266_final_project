A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend with weed is better
A friend with breasts and all the rest
A friend who's dressed in leather

A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who'll tease is better
Our thoughts compress which makes us blessed
And makes for stormy weather

A friend in need's a friend indeed
My Japanese is better
And when she's pressed, she will undress
And then she's boxing clever

A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who bleeds is better
My friend confessed she passed the test
And we will never sever

Day's dawning, skins crawling
Day's dawning, skins crawling
Day's dawning, skins crawling
Day's dawning, skins crawling

Pure morning, pure morning
Pure morning, pure morning

A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who'll tease is better
Our thoughts compress which makes us blessed
And makes for stormy weather

A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who bleeds is better
My friend confessed she passed the test
And we will never sever

Day's dawning, skins crawling
Day's dawning, skins crawling
Day's dawning, skins crawling
Day's dawning, skins crawling

Pure morning, pure morning
Pure morning, pure morning
Pure morning, pure morning
Pure morning, pure morning

A friend in need's a friend indeed
My Japanese is better
And when she's pressed, she will undress
And then she's boxing clever

A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend with weed is better
A friend with breasts and all the rest
A friend who's dressed in leather
