Susan strong, this is where you belong, hanging with me on a fallen tree.
Don't you think you deserve this to live up here on the surface? I think you
do and I think all your friend do too. How long have you lived in the
darkness? I just want to show you the light, because you're a human just
like me Susan and I want you in my Life. Susan Strong you turn my heart
on.
