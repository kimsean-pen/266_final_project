I've been there, done that
Ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
(Been there, done that)
I've been there, done that

I gotta take some time, say what's on my mind
Before I get too close to you
'Cos I feel that I'm about to cross the line
And there's no going back once I do

(So here's the key)
Never thought of falling so deep
Am I pushing you out of your day
(How do you feel)
Gonna know you're playing for keeps
Boy, I won't accept anything less

'Cos I've been there, done that
(Been there, done that)
I don't wanna get hurt again, matter of fact
I refuse to go back
(Refuse to, go back)
To half-hearted promises, simple as that
I've been there, done that

Now I don't wanna rush, get too into us
I need a little more from you
And I don't mean to fuss but this is serious
And I hope that you feel that way too

(So here's the key)
Never thought of falling so deep
Boy, the time has come for you to confess
(How do you feel)
Gonna know you're playing for keeps
'Cos I won't accept anything less

'Cos I've been there, done that
(Been there, done that)
I don't wanna get hurt again, matter of fact
I refuse to go back
(Refuse to, go back)
To half-hearted promises, simple as that

'Cos I've been there, done that
(Been there, done that)
I don't wanna get hurt again, matter of fact
I refuse to go back
(Refuse to, go back)
To half-hearted promises, simple as that

Tell me straight 'cos I ain't gonna wait
For you to break my heart
I wanna hear it, say that you mean it
Before we go too far

'Cos I've been there, done that
I don't wanna get hurt again, matter of fact
(Matter of fact)
I refuse to go back
(Go back)
To half-hearted promises, simple as that
(I know you're playing for keeps)

'Cos I've been there, done that
(Been there, done that)
I don't wanna get hurt again, matter of fact
(Matter of fact)
I refuse to go back
(Refuse to, go back)
To half-hearted promises, simple as that
(Simple as that)

'Cos I've been there, done that
(Been there, done that)
I don't wanna get hurt again, matter of fact
(No, no)
I refuse to go back
(Refuse to, go back)
To half-hearted promises, simple as that
