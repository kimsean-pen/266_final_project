We will follow and our hearts will bleed
Servants of the circle will renounce their greed
We will follow and our hearts will bleed
Servants of the circle will renounce their greed
Within the realms of reason
We've felt the ominous rise
Taking turns to encircle the scapegoat
Our everlasting vice
Everlasting vice

From the shadow of the restless mind
To the hollow and deserted sky
We feel the hunger
But we're bound by the night
We see the sign
But we're still slaves of empty

Spaces controlling this ride
Changing the pace of time
Watching the stars align
Unknown faces reside in my mind
Poisoned but mesmerized
Serving the darker times

We hear a distant calling
The current is pulling our souls
Sudden defeat but constant turmoil
We've embraced our fatal role

Relieved but torn from the inside
Received but the wish is dead
The wish is dead

From the shadow of the restless mind
We see the sign
But we're still slaves of empty

Spaces controlling this ride
Changing the pace of time
Watching the stars align
Unknown faces reside in my mind
Poisoned but mesmerized
Serving the darker times
Darker times

We fear the dawning of a new day
The bleakest winds are coming through
If this is death I will remember
Every word I saw in you

Spaces controlling this ride
Changing the pace of time
Watching the stars align
Unknown faces reside in my mind
Poisoned but mesmerized
Serving the darker times
Darker times
