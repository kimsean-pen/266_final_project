I was thinkin' about him
Thought he'll realize me
But it's only just a dream
If I never let him know

In a while I look at him
I bit one's, my lips
But for sure, I want him to know

Yes you do, yes you do
You're my only inspiration
Yes you do, yes you do
You're the one that I want to, baby
Cause I love the way that you are, Baby

I'm tired of waitin' baby
Tryin' to move on
But I fall, back to you again

Back to reef 2x

That I want you, That I need you
And I know (Yes I do)
That I want you, That I need you
And You know (Yes You Do)

But I'm fallin back to you again
But Im fallin back to you again
Yes, you do
