Can you sleep as the sound hits your ears?
One at a time
An unspoken balance here
Unabridged for so many years

That I should stare at
Receivers
To receive her
Isn't fair

Don't worry I'll catch you
Don't worry I'll catch you
Don't ever worry

Your arms in mine
Any time
Wouldn't trade anything
You're still my everything

To my surprise
Before my eyes
You arrive

Don't worry I'll catch you
Don't worry I'll catch you
Don't ever worry

Still breaking old habits,
Habits
You pulled the wool over me
And I can see everything
Everything
Remembering
Jinx removing

Don't worry I'll catch you
Don't worry I'll catch you
Don't ever worry

No need for reminding
You're still all that matters to me
