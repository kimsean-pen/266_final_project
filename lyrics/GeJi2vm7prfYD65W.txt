One can only apologize so many times
Before the words become useless, stale and intertwined
So should I write you this letter or is it better left unpinned?

Just decide, I've been waiting all night
And what we can't see through the haze
Will soon be clear the day that you're mine
So decide, we've been waiting all night

So here we are again I'm weighing out my words again
What's the weight of my word when I talk too fucking much?
And when I open my mouth blood pours out
I feel lost in my head again when she says

"Decide. I've been waiting all night"
And what we can't see through the haze
Will soon be clear the day that you're mine
So decide
She's been waiting all night
She's been waiting all night (Just decide)
She's been waiting all night
She's been waiting all night (Just decide)
She's been waiting all night

So decide
