I was back in high school when
We were talking late from 10
Staying up till 3 AM
Just friends

You didn't have your license yet
We would lie under sunsets
Without a single worry yet
Just friends

And you would let me cut your hair
I thought about you everywhere
I haven't been the same since then
Just friends

'Cause every time I ran
I ran to you
I meant it every time I said I loved you
I kiss the thought of you and I
I still regret the day that we said goodbye

And do you think of me at night
I still wish we could've made it right
You can't say that I never tried
I guess everything seems more clear
Here on the other side

I left you at the station where
I would cry and watch you stare
Out the window as you left
Just friends

I called you form a payphone line
Out of the country but I'm fine
I just miss you all the time
Just friends

'Cause every time I ran
I ran to you
I meant it every time I said I loved you
I kiss the thought of you and I
I still regret the day that we said goodbye

And do you think of me at night
I still wish we could've made it right
You can't say that I never tried
I guess everything seems more clear
Here on the other side
Here on the other side

And there are so many things
I wanted to say
That I want so much
And you moved away
And I think of all the times that you were right
I wish I could explain

'Cause every time I ran
I ran to you
I meant it every time I said I loved you
I kiss the thought of you and I
I still regret the day that we said goodbye

And do you think of me at night
I still wish we could've made it right
You can't say that I never tried
You can't say that I never tried

'Cause every time I ran
I ran to you
I meant it every time I said I loved you
I kiss the thought of you and I
I still regret the day that we said goodbye

And do you think of me at night
I still wish we could've made it right
You can't say that I never tried
I guess everything seems more clear
Here on the other side

And if you're wondering
I'm great
I'm stronger now but still
The same
My love for you it will
Remain
My friend
