Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Let's just pretend
(Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink)
Life's falling apart
(Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink)
It wasn't really the end
(Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink)
It was performance art
I'm surfin' perma-prescription drug
Ecstasy opera
Drink my weight daily
Black out with my baby
(Yeah!)
I tried to love her
She screamed "Surrender, harder motherfucker"
I ran for cover
She screamed "Surrender, harder motherfucker"
Surrender, surrender, surrender
Oh, surrender
(Black metal guy)
Let's just pretend
This never happened
Let's just pretend
I'm surfin' perma-prescription drug
Ecstasy opera
Drink my weight daily
Black out with my baby
(Let's go!)
I tried to love her
She screamed "Surrender, harder motherfucker"
I ran for cover
She screamed "Surrender, harder motherfucker"
Surrender, surrender, surrender
Oh, surrender
Surrender, surrender, surrender
Oh, surrender
(Surrender) Yeah, yeah
(Surrender) Yeah, yeah
(Surrender) Yeah, yeah
Surrender
(Surrender) Yeah, yeah
(Surrender) Yeah, yeah
(Surrender) Yeah, yeah
Oh, surrender
"One more time?"
Oh, surrender!
