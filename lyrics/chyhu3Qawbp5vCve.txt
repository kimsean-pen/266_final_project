My heart just sank the moment I saw you
You're the image of a girl that I used to know
Don't be alarmed if it seems hard for me to explain
But every detail of your face makes me recall her name
Treading water, I keep treading water

Maybe it's another chance to mug myself again
Maybe it's another chance
I'm sure I'll fuck things up in the same way
Maybe it's another chance to mug myself again

Can you forgive the things I do that I can't amend
Nor the way I yearn for her, I hope you can pretend
Girl, you're a fire and you'll find that I want to get burned
No matter what you can teach me I'm sure I'll never learn
Treading water, I keep treading water

Maybe it's another chance to mug myself again
Maybe it's another chance
I'm sure I'll fuck things up in the same way
Maybe it's another chance to mug myself again

If my concentration seems spread too thin
And when you speak my eyes glaze over
I'm sorry girl, it's not you, it's her

And you're another chance to mug myself again.
Maybe you're another chance
I'm sure I'll fuck things up in the same way
Maybe it's another chance to mug myself again

And you're another chance to mug myself again.
Maybe you're another chance
I'm sure I'll fuck things up in the same way
Maybe it's another chance to mug myself again
