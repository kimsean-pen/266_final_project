Oh what a time to be alive
Wake up and smell the dynamite
And keep your eyes locked tight to that screen
And don't believe everything that you see
You will find modern life's a catastrophe

Is it just me or does anyone else feel like this could be farewell?
Oh, we almost had it then we pissed it all away
Building walls, dropping bombs
Stop the world, I'm getting off
Oh, we almost had it
Never thought I'd see the day
When the world went up in flames
When the world went up in flames

We all worship celebrities, desperate for an identity
But cigarettes and MDMA don't give you substance
You don't think about what you say
Cause your mouth is bigger than your brain
It's a shame, so fake and you're all the same

Is it just me or does anyone else feel like this could be farewell?
Oh, we almost had it then we pissed it all away
Building walls, dropping bombs
Stop the world, I'm getting off
Oh, we almost had it
Never thought I'd see the day
When the world went up in flames

There's a Black cat in the windows of Parliament
There's a man in the back of a black cab, talking about the good days
When it all went up in flames
(Happy Judgement Day)
It all went up in flames
(Happy Judgement Day)

Is it just me or does anyone else feel like this could be farewell?
Oh, we almost had it then we pissed it all away
Building walls, dropping bombs
Stop the world, I'm getting off
It's been a long time coming
Never thought I'd see the day
It's been a long time coming
Never thought I'd see the day
When the world went up in flames
If the world went up in flames
