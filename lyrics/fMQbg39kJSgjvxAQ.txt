I found my fickle friend
Out in the alley way
He said, "You don't look so good"
I said, "Hey doc, that's great"
You started practicing?
I never got the note
So let's shake and trade
And be on our way

So here we are again
Inside your neon shrine
Sharing a chopping block
Under embarrassed light
I try to hide myself
I tuck myself away
And we both grab hold
Say, "No you don't"

The morning's hot and harsh
My notebook fills itself
The words come thick with sweat
But it feels like someone else
Is writing all of this
Someone I just can't believe
So I mop my brow
Set my pen back down
It's still me, still me

I'm grabbing at a feeling now
That I could never name
Some signpost to remind me
How I wanted things this way

She says you're pretty
But you hate yourself
I could hear it clear as day

I say, I sing like this
It sounds worse than it is

I'm okay, okay
I'm okay, okay
Just stay, just stay
Just stay, just stay
Just stay, just stay
Just stay, just stay
Just stay, just stay
Just stay, just stay
Just stay, just stay
