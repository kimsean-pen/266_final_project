Joy escapes through the tangled days (Iron demands fire)
Youth escapes through the blur of pain (Iron demands fire)
Smoke cloaks the sky, the bell explodes
A shudder runs through, we have nowhere to turn
When the luster is gone and life loses right
We cannot escape the slipping of time
Exodus of eden led by convenience
The murk and marrow are all that we know
When the luster is gone and life loses right
Nothing will escape the slipping of time
Love needs to feed
Ghosts need belief
