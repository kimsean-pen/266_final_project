The sins of our fathers
They start to add up
Undress to our curses
And forget-me-nots

I'll sleep forever
On the hands that were given to me
Haunt me forever
Until I jump back into the sea
Too much too young
(And receive what ain't given to me)
I'll wait forever
And receive what ain't given to me

The sins of our fathers
They start to add up
Undress to our curses
And forget-me-nots
The sins of our fathers
We'll never shake off
Undress to our curses
And forget-me-nots

I'll sing whenever
You get bored and ain't looking for me
Unbridled pleasures
In a void, on a narcissist sea
And the tide's in and sucking at me
And you yawn so I have to repeat
If you could keep your mouth steady
But nothing makes a difference
So forget I even said it

The sins of our fathers
They start to add up
Undress to our curses
And forget-me-nots
The sins of our fathers
We'll never shake off
Undress to our curses
And forget-me-nots
