Can't touch me

Hands all over the Eastern border
You know what I think we're falling
From composure
Hands all over Western culture
Ruffling feathers and turning eagles into vultures
Yeah, Into vultures

Got my arms around baby brother
Put your hands away
You're gonna kill your mother, gunna kill your mother
And I love her
Yeah, and I love her

Hands all over the coastal waters
The crew men thank her
Then lay down their oily blanket
Hands all over the inland forest
In a striking motion trees fall down
Like dying soldiers
Yeah, like dying soldiers

Got my arms around baby brother
Put your hands away
You're gonna kill your mother, gunna kill your mother
And I love her
Yeah, and I love her

Hands all over the peasant's daughter
She's our bride
She'll never make it out alive
Hands all over the words I utter
Change them into things you want to
Like balls of clay
Put your hands away
You're gonna kill your mother
And I love her
(she loves me)
