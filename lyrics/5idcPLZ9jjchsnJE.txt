No we've got nothing to lose, except everything we have
And I've got nothing to prove but it's just who I am

But it's the same old rain, no I won't back down
These satellites overhead, I think I love this town
But you made yourself a home inside my mind

Don't mind me, don't mind me
I was just thinking of you
I feel alive inside, oh finally I feel alive inside
Don't mind me, don't mind me
I was just thinking of you
I feel alive inside, oh finally I feel alive inside

I feel alive inside, oh finally I feel alive inside
I feel alive inside, oh finally I feel alive inside

No i've got nothing to lose, except everything you are
I'm not looking at the moon i'm staring at the stars

But it's the same old rain, no I won't back down
These satellites overhead, I think I love this town
But you made yourself a home inside my mind

Don't mind me, don't mind me
I was just thinking of you
I feel alive inside, oh finally I feel alive inside
Don't mind me, don't mind me
I was just thinking of you
I feel alive inside, oh finally I feel alive inside

I feel alive inside, oh finally I feel alive inside
I feel alive inside, oh finally I feel alive inside

Oh this is everything I had in mind
I finally got away, finally got away
Oh this is everything I had in mind
I finally got away, finally got a way

Don't mind me, don't mind me
I was just thinking of you
I feel alive inside, oh finally I feel alive inside
Don't mind me, don't mind me
I was just thinking of you
I feel alive inside, oh finally I feel alive inside

Don't mind me, don't mind me
I was just thinking of you
I feel alive inside, oh finally I feel alive inside
Don't mind me, don't mind me
I was just thinking of you
I feel alive inside, oh finally I feel alive inside

I feel alive inside, oh finally I feel alive inside
I feel alive inside, oh finally I feel alive inside

Don't mind me, don't mind me
I was just thinking of you
