Down on my knees
Feeling lost I look around
Another day I can see
My life crashing to the ground

Now that the time is ripe for change
None of the lies that I've been told
None of them lying preachers
Cannot curse me anymore

Our lost souls will rise above as one

We are alone, we are the night
We are the ghosts that come to life
We will scare away reality
When walls are falling down
We are alone, we aren't blind
We see the shadows from inside
We will run away and hide
When the new dawn is breaking

Down in the deep
It has just begun to crawl
It's the life I can't live
In a place I don't belong

Now that the time is ripe for change
None of the lies that I've been told
None of them lying preachers
Cannot curse me anymore

Our lost souls will rise above as one

We are alone, we are the night
We are the ghosts that come to life
We will scare away reality
When walls are falling down
We are alone, we aren't blind
We see the shadows from inside
We will run away and hide
When the new dawn is breaking

We are the ghosts that come to life
To see the shadows from inside
We will scare away reality
When walls are falling down

We are alone, we are the night
We are the ghosts that come to life
We are alone, we aren't blind
We will run away and hide

We are alone, we are the night
We are the ghosts that come to life
We will scare away reality
When walls are falling down
We are alone, we aren't blind
We see the shadows from inside
We will run away and hide
When the new dawn is breaking... down
