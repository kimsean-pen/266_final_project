Time now, summer side
Time now, summer side
Time now, summer side

Don't try and fight it
Be at another beat
Strolling bottom
You left nothing

Time now, summer side
Time now, summer side
Time now, summer side

Don't try to find
For that wicked path
Find where it's hiding
Guy's not coming back

Don't try to find
Be at another beat
Strolling bottom
You left nothing

Time now, summer side
Time now, summer side
Time now, summer side

Don't try to find
For that wicked path
Find where it's hiding
Guy's not coming back

Every day you'll want it done
Everything new, everything new
Every day you'll want it done
Everything new, everything new

Don't try to find
For that wicked path
Find where it's hiding
Guy's not coming back

Don't try to find
For that wicked path
Find where it's hiding
Guy's not coming back

Every day you'll want it done
Everything new, everything new
Every day you'll want it done
Everything new, everything new
