Every man deserves a woman
Every woman deserves a man
So I'm about to ask.

I have feel the strange vibration
And I had a lot of patience
But Where is my other half

Can somebody say
Can somebody tell
I Love her
Will I Love her?

Can to hear my pray
Many Many days
I Wonder, Will I wonder

I wanna why she left me
Why she left me?
