Truth mis-user, Abuser
Death Dealer, Devastator

There has to be, Someone killed

I need this, I need you
On your knees
And we'll pray
Together now

Effortless
Mighty Trust Krusher

I need this, It's in my heart
I love you, My trust is evermore

Hate me, Tread on me
And you taught me, I finally slay you... Now
