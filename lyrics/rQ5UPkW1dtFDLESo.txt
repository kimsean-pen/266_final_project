I'm like a cat in a cage,
Locked up and battered and bruised.
I am the protigal son,
A single protigy too.
I am the love of your life,
? well and confused.
I turn each day into night,
I stand there waiting for you.
There is desire to fight,
But I have nothing to prove.
With the crowd and some lights,
You start to feel things move.
Do you have something to hide,
Cuz I've been?
I am the child inside,
Back up and give me some room.

I'm just a bastard child,
Don't let it go to your head.
I'm just a waste of your time,
Maybe I'm better off dead.
You turn this? into night,
I'm fuckin' jekyll and hyde.
We'll have the times of our lives,
Although we're dying inside.

So let me go, go.
So let me go, go.
Just let me go, go.
I'd rather go it alone.

So let me go, go.
So let me go, go.
Just let me go, go,
I'm never comin' home.

Don't start to panic for me,
Cuz I have nothing to lose.
I am as bright as the sun,
I burn up all that I choose.
And from the side of a field,
I see a city with lights.
I touch her face when I kneel,
she tells me she's not alive
I am too nervous to run,
the kids who scatter and hide
To reach and grab onto someone,
But end up buried alive.
A world is waiting for me,
A world that I rarely knew.
I start to feel in my feet,
They kick down walls as they move.

I'm just a bastard child,
don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time,
maybe I'm better off dead
They turn us loose in the night,
I'm fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives
although we're dying inside

So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone

So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home

I'm just a bastard child,
don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time,
maybe I'm better off dead
They turn us loose in the night,
I'm fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives
although we're dying inside

So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'd rather go it alone

So let me go, go
So let me go, go
Just let me go, go
I'm never coming home
