my ears are ringing
there's a tingling in the back of my throat

can't stop all the pressure building up in my head
in my head

everybody wants me
everybody needs me
everybody needs me

what's hurting me when i breath?
perhaps it's just mold on the ceiling?

everybody's coming down with the same thing
everybody's coming down with the same thing

germs!
they'll get you when you're not careful
germs
they'll get you when you're not careful
germs!
they'll get you when you're not careful

germs!
they'll get you when you're not careful
germs
they'll get you when you're not careful
germs!
they'll get you when you're not careful

Better get some medicine if you know what's good for you
