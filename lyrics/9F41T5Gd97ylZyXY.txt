Never awaken from depths of despair
Defined by the profane
Endured by pathology
They cannot be held below

The struggle dying with each passive thrall
With each convert to self abhorrence

Distortions of former selves
Veil the sickness and fear
To never awaken

Refuse attribution
Succumbing to the trial of constriction

In chaos
Witness the inversion
The reverent become the abject
Adopting blackened hearts
To reject all cause

Veil the sickness and fear
To never awaken

The pure and virtuous scorched in their wake
Bled by unabated scorn
To bleed and endure

Blackened hearts
Not only inherit fortune
but also failure
And reject all cause

Only within dreams of envy
Are we born into an abyss of untread paths
On unmade worlds
To reject all cause
All circumstance
And yield to naught
