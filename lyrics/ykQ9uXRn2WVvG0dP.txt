With his ear pressed up against the air
He listened to gravity
On a newly-built train
Gliding silent through the Holocene
And through the countryside
Past the grouses stained the ultramarine
Of comic book eventide

Can you fell the flow
And the pull of the tail?
The viscosity of space and name?
The eddy of minds chained in slavery
Embraced by the face in the flame?

Tapped by midnight's wand of dew
The peering eye decumbent
Flared into an aleph hailing
Starry sputum disassociated
Cosmic epithelium a-trailing
He watched a planet drifting through

And the plane pulled itself through the air
Slow as honey
The whole sky moved with it
