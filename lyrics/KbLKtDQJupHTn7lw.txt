Come before us, come before

All the colors of your heart
All the whistle in the park
Children swimming through the spark
I was hooding around, in a sea of sound

All the trumpets play whoa whoa

I got to cheer up now
Gotta cheer up now
Gotta cheer up now
Gotta cheer up now
Gotta cheer up now
Gotta cheer up now
Gotta cheer up now
