A violent summer storm gave them birth
One million volts into the earth
Emerging from the ground they've come for you
Nowhere to hide what can you do?
The worms
The crave the human flesh it's what they eat
Carnivorous maggots like their meat
You've come to realize this must be
The end of all humanity
The worms
The horror
