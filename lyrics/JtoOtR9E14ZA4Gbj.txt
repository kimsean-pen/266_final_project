Luber
I want to hug you
I want to tell your mom to love you

You got your dreams
They're about the Birthday Party
I've got my dreams
Whatever they used to be

Luber
On your birthday
I will answer your 1000 questions
Luber let me help you
It will ease my conscience

What would it be
If you knew were saving my soul
And what would you think
If you knew you were the toast of my town

Luber, on your birthday
I will answer your 1000 questions
Luber let me help you
It will ease my conscience
