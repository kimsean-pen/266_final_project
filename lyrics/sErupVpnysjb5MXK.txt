Time to leave this town
Now your dreams have all let you down
Noone here will miss you now
Time to wake up and look around

He used to be a lovely boy
Lovely boy
Lovely boy
He used to be a lovely boy

Turn away and turn ahead
"Just a hopeless dreamer", she said
Eyes of cloud and feet of lead
Find a shore that needs you instead

He used to be a lovely boy
Lovely boy
Lovely boy
He used to be a lovely boy
Time on your hands
World at your feet
No adventure left incomplete

Find a place where you can hide
From the love that holds you inside
Time so unkind
Like an old friend leaves you behind

He used to be a lovely boy
Lovely boy
Lovely boy
He used to be a lovely boy
Time on your hands
