It was starting to rain
On the night that they first decided
It was blinding with snow
On the night that they ran away

They were found in the dark
But they never returned
Just like somebody slammed the door, bang

She was meant to be wild
He was nearly a child
But they only could feel each other
They were paper and fire
Angel and liar, the devil of one another

Then they were thrown to the ground
With a terrible sound
Just like somebody broke a heart

Rock 'n' Roll Children
Alone again
Rock 'n' Roll Children
Without a friend
But they got Rock 'n' Roll
Yeahhhhhhhh!!!!
It was starting to rain
On the night that they cried forever
Oh, it was blinding with snow
On the night that they screamed goodbye

They were lost in the dark
And they never returned
Just like somebody slammed the door

On Rock 'n' Roll Children
Alone again
Rock 'n' Roll Children
Without a friend

For Rock 'n' Roll Children
Caught up in the spinning wheel
For Rock 'n' Roll Children
Alone again

It was starting to rain
On the night that they ran
It was blinding with snow
On the night we let them go

For Rock 'n' Roll Children
Oh, children
Rock 'n' Roll Children
Children of the night

For Rock 'n' Roll Children
For children lost, poor souls
Rock 'n' Roll Children
Oh oh oh

For Rock 'n' Roll Children
Rock 'n' Roll
For Rock 'n' Roll Children
