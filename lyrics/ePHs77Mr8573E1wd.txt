Yea yea yea
Woah woah woah
Bang bang bang bang
And we just want to be wanted
Running from real life perfect persona
Fucked up the real life wanna be wasted
Wasting my whole life chasin', chasin'
We just want to be wanted
Running from real life perfect persona
Fucked up the real life wanna be wasted
Wasting my whole life
Yeah

"What would the sauce be?- I said-
Without the pasta and bread"
Give me some space as of late
I been feeling a little bit claustrophobic
Long as the squad getting fed
And real niggas bobbin' they head
I know imma be cool
My weed a million decibels
My lungs heavy as a pool
Quit watching the news
Niggas starting making the news
Had to make a fucking move
Shake the city up
Had me in the club like Gary P
Supersonics got em all hooked
Monte found me now we all booked
No fatigue we in another league
Shawty top me when it's rubbery
Take a lot to keep a G intrigued
Ion know that's just the G in me
They been pumping the team up like creatine
Recently feel like I'm losing my memory
Don't got much tick on my tock
I be missing my block
Momma I love you, know pops hold it down
New jack from the city bitch I'm Smino Brown
My hat be my home she rollin' up stoned
And we both runnin' fucked in the moment

And we just want to be wanted
Running from real life perfect persona
Fucked up in real life wanna be wasted
Wasting my whole life chasin', chasin'
Ye-Yeah
Want to be wanted
Running from real life perfect persona
Fucked up in real life wanna be wasted
Wasting my whole life chasin', chasin'

Yeah pace it pace it
Wonder bread took the flag race it race it
Just hope I got patience look at me [?]
a placement
It ain't no service swear I'm just roaming and walking
Still ain't got a car, miss the bus bummy walking to the function
Might sprint if I can, but I'm on my last bar
Life in a chokehold like Bart
Better be playing your part
Better be winning a lot
Better not be like these niggas that black out in jams like pajamas they in it a lot
Like bitch I'm a sinner a lot
Moms in the ER room often missed dinner a lot
Talking this shit while I'm burning this dope got me floating through turbulence baby I'm way way way up
Stuck in my ways ways ways uh
Throwing my cape cape cape
This ain't for saving hoes I just feel super when I rap this lucrative back in the day, uh
I would be like fuck this class lets go downtown baby lets come up on a stain ya
It ain't no room to complain, burn it they still said it burnt up my brain

And we just want to be wanted
Running from real life perfect persona
Fucked up the real life wanna be wasted
Wasting my whole life chasin', chasin'
Want to be wanted
Running from real life perfect persona
Fucked up the real life wanna be wasted
Wasting my whole life yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

What it is lil mama?
