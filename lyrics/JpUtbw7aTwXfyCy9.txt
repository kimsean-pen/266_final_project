A moment's happiness
Under the influence
I tried all night to recreate
And it was never ever gonna last long
And it was only ever gonna go wrong
And in the morning I only have myself to blame

Am I a planet hunter
Or a brave deviator?
I left my mind behind in 2015
Am I a planet hunter
Or a brave deviator?
I left my mind behind in 2015

Ooh ooh

A moment's madness
Complements your innocence
I tried all night to initiate (ooh)
And I only ever try to have fun
I'm only old when I don't feel young
And if you're with me, yeah
You can come, yeah, along (ooh)

Am I a planet hunter
Or a brave deviator?
I left my mind behind in 2015
Am I a planet hunter
