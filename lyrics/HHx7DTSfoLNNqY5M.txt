Dig it dig it
Love cannot attach itself to binding ugliness
Rot in silence to advise life the point at hand
Indifference resolving of each others needs
Dress it up in false kindness create empathy
Hungry lie beside name your game
Feelings feeling sorry that I ever came
Dissolve taste sweet nothing corporate nothing
Illogical of own accord with choice of politics
Open your eyes to verify the life experience
Practitioner of medicine belong until the end
Bringing hope scars the point extend eternity
Dig it dig it
Execute economic slave
Dig it dig it
Feel it unearthly remains
Dig it dig it
Freedom as an offering
Dig it dig it
Ask again
Flesh and bone attach itself to ancient monuments
Unsurpassed except for us unheard violence
Deparutre from the fragrant ledge fallen magistrate
Give it back a claim to right value ecstasy
Hungry live decide name your game
Feelings feeling sorry that I ever came
Sugar and water dissolves the taste sweet nothing
Dig it dig it
Execute economic slave
Dig it dig it
Feel it unearthly remains
Dig it dig it
Freedom as an offering
Dig it dig it
Ask again
Boils bitten haggard pick vomit kicking out
Razor slide black eye shroud brain bespattered jaw
Retaliate begrudgingly precise as what it seems
Fear of claim upon the cyst pent up carnal grin
Live decide name your game
Feelings feeling sorry that I ever came
? too far away game game? grave
Dig it dig it
Execute economic slave
Dig it dig it
Feel it unearthly remains
Dig it dig it
Freedom as an offering
Dig it dig it
Ask again
Ask again
