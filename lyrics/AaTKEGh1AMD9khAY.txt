I fix upon a whispering light...
A shimmering stone,
A gate of night.
With mesmerized eyes
I await his call,
Messenger of Father Azathoth

Pale faces align
In hypnotic trance.
Malevolent hands
Are being raised!
Voices soar through the eldritch halls
Of the cadaverous church.

Shine,
Trapezohedron!
Embrace me in thine glowing trance!
Bless me with thine arcana!

A crystalline gate to the stars...
Far from the Moon
And from Mars.
Ancient soil—deserts of Yuggoth
Herein reigns the race of the Mi-Go.

Shine,
Trapezohedron!
Embrace me in thine glowing trance!
Bless me with thine arcana!

Iä, Iä,
Nyarlathotep!
I yearn to be thine servant—
Speak through me!

Iä, Iä,
Nyarlathotep!
I call forth ye,
Oh thousand-faced god.
