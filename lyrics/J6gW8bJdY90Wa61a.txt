Well it isn't getting easier
We are shattered everywhere
No it isn't getting easier now
But we're not beyond repair

And we are brittle, beware
We crack, we tear
Handle with care
Half done entirely
We fall apart
Rebuild, restart
Right where we are
Found wanting everything

Fractured in fragments
Us fragile things
Falling to pieces
But we're all the same broken
Fractions and halves of
Some greater thing
Falling to pieces

But we're all the same broken parts
But we're all the same broken parts
But we're all the same broken parts
You can't fall any further
Any further from the floor
So gather up yourself now. love
Just as you were before

We are brittle, beware
We crack, we tear
Handle with care
Half done entirely
We fall apart
Rebuild, restart
Right where we are
Found wanting everything

Fractured in fragments
Us fragile things
Falling to pieces
But we're all the same broken
Fractions and halves of
Some greater thing
Falling to pieces
But we're all the same broken parts

Fragile things, fragile things, fragile things
But we're all the same broken parts
Fragile things, fragile things, fragile things
But we're all the same broken parts

(Rebuild, restart, we wait, we are)
Fractured in fragments
Us fragile things
Falling to pieces
But we're all the same broken
Fractions and halves of
Some greater thing
Falling to pieces
But we're all the same broken parts

But we're all the same broken parts
