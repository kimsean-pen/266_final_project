It's something
that look in your eyes tonight
Like magic
it's changing everything in sight
I hear it
all around me everyday
in the music that you play

This is a song
about boys and girls
You hear it
playing all over the world

The night sky
like velvet masks our eyes tonight
and falling
reveals the sun rise and ignite
We feel it
all around us everyday
in the music that we play

This is a song
about boys and girls
You hear it
playing all over the world

All over the world
All over the world

It's sincere and subjective
superficial and true
Easy and predictable
exciting and new
to say "I want you"

This is a song
about boys and girls
You hear it
playing all over the world
