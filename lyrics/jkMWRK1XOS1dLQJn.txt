Chillin, rubber band stacks to the ceiling
And on and on yes the crew stay winnin
Chillin, rubber band stacks to the ceiling
And on and on yes the crew stay winnin
Chillin, rubber band stacks to the ceiling
And on and on yes the crew stay winnin

Splish splash we're tearin it up
I came for the gut
I make em up-chuck
I come through like disco disaster
I set the pace then make it go faster

I fuck up the party
I'm Ken to the barbie
I'm back of the harley
I'm nasty and gnarly
I'm hot like umami
I'm mobbing wit Gotti's
I'm sorry not sorry

Give it to me baby like ooh ah
Make em really wanna say ooh lawd
shimmy shimmy yam wit the boo raw
zippity dippity doo dah

Throw em up
I'm showing up
roll em up
Let's blow it up
I'm riding that wave
I'm riding that wave

Throw em up
I'm showing up
Roll em up
Let's blow it up
I'm riding that wave
I'm riding that wave

Chilin, rubber band stacks to the ceiling
And on and on yes the crew stay winnin
Chilin, rubber band stacks to the ceiling
And on and on yes the crew stay winnin
Chilin, rubber band stacks to the ceiling
And on and on yes the crew stay winnin

I'm back once again I'm the renegade bitch
I let bitches play on my renegade shit
I popped up to slay on a renegade hit
The candy is sweet take a renegade lick

I am the enemy
You ain't a friend to me
Killin em steadily
Pussy so heavenly
Voice is so velvety
Fuck up your destiny
Think that you readily?
Baby you better be

Give it to me baby like ooh ah
Make em really wanna say ooh lawd
Shimmy shimmy yam wit the boo raw
Zippity dippity doo dah
Zippity dippity doo dah
Zippity dippity doo dah

Throw em up like ooh ah
I'm showing up say ooh lawd
Roll em up like boo rah
Let's blow it up
I'm riding that wave
I'm riding that wave

Throw em up like ooh ah
I'm showing up say ooh lawd
Roll em up like boo rah
Let's blow it up
I'm riding that wave
I'm riding that wave
zippity dippity doo dah

Chillin, rubber band stacks to the ceiling
And on and on yes the crew stay winnin

And on and on yes the crew stay winnin
Chilin, rubber band stacks to the ceiling
And on and on yes the crew stay winnin
Chilin, rubber band stacks to the ceiling
And on and on yes the crew stay winnin
