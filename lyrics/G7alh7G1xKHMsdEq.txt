I gotta walk away
Can't handle the dangerous games that you play
Not trying to change you, babe
So keep on, keep on

I gotta look away
Trying to ride at your tempo but I can't keep up
Not trying to change you, babe
So keep on, keep on

Oh, yeah, and it was perfect
Oh, yeah, and no, I don't regret it

You pulled me under, gave me something I never had
Pushed me over with no turn to push back
I never felt so good or so bad
Went to Hell and back, but it was worth it

Oh, yeah, and it was perfect
Oh, yeah, and no, I don't regret it

And I'm not the only one
Riding shotgun these days in your car
Not trying to change you, babe
So keep on, keep on

'Cause this ain't my kind of fun
The rumors are true and you gotta do you
Not trying to change you, babe
So keep on, keep on

You pulled me under, gave me something I never had
Pushed me over with no turn to push back
I never felt so good or so bad
Went to Hell and back, but it was worth it

Oh, yeah, and it was perfect
Oh, yeah, and no, I don't regret it

Oh, yeah, it was worth it
Oh, oh, yeah, and it was perfect (It was perfect)
Perfect, yeah

You pulled me under, gave me something I never had
Pushed me over with no turn to push back
I never felt so good or so bad
Went to Hell and back, but it was worth it

Oh, yeah, and it was perfect
Oh, yeah, and no, I don't regret it

You pulled me under, gave me something I never had
Pushed me over with no turn to push back
I never felt so good or so bad
Went to Hell and back, but it was worth it

Oh, yeah, and it was perfect
Oh, yeah, and no, I don't regret it
