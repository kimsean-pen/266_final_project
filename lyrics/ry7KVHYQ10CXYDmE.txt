Things like that drive me out of my mind
I watched it for a little while
I like to watch things on TV

Satellite's gone way up to Mars
Soon it'll be filled with parkin' cars
I watched it for a little while
I love to watch things on TV
(Uh uhu uh uhu uh uhu uuhh)

(Bum, bum, bum) Satellite of love
(Bum, bum, bum) Satellite of love

I've been told that you've been bold
With Harry, Mark, and John
Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday through Thursday
With Harry, Mark, and John
