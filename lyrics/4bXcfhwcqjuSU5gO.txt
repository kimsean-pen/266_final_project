Oh whatever comes

And when your world is crumbling down
I can make it better
When youre lost, need to be found
I will look for-e-ever

For you

And when your world is crumbling down
I can make it better
When youre lost, need to be found
I will look for-e-ever

Just keep me close, there is no storm
That we can not weather
However how high, however low
I will face for-e-ever

For you
For you
For you
For you

We are the lucky ones
Oh whatever comes
We are the lucky ones
Ooh yeah
We are the lucky ones
Oh whatever comes
We are the lucky ones
