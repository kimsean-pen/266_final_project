I hereby give up all my changes
And since I fell to the station
And open doors decay them
Habits are still far to go now
And we don't make this up for
the lonesome days we talk about
Sometimes your weight belongs to me

So not a shame it could be a year
Become just what I found
We don't mind the time
we lost in here
Only because your near

Still I challenge all the lovely times
For giving shy reflections
And hoping that we'd fail to dissapear
Features to the blue sky
And we don't make this up for
the lonesome days we talk about
Sometimes your weight belongs to me

So no a shame it could be a year
Become just what I found
We don't mind the time
we lost in here
Only because your near
Giving up whats to say
is on my mind
Down and I guess we're fine
