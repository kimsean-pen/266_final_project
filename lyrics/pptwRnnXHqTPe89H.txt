You can't know, oh no
You can't know
How much I think about you, no
It's making my head spin

Looking at you
And you are looking at me
And we both know what we want
Hmm, so close to giving in

Feel so nice
Oh yeah, you feel so nice
Wish I could spend the night
But I can't pay the price, oh no, no

But I'm flying so high
High off the ground
When you're around

And I can feel you're high
Rocking me inside
It's too much to hide

I know, oh yes
I know that we can't
Be together
But, I just like to dream

It's so strange
The way our paths have crossed
How we were brought together
Hmm, it's written in the stars it seems

Feel so nice
Oh yeah, you feel so nice
I'd love to spend the night
But I can't pay the price, oh no, no

And I'm flying so high
High off the ground
When you're around

And I can feel you're high
Touching me inside
And it's too much to hide

Back to earth
Where did you take me to
I know there's no such thing

As painless love
Well it'll catch us up
And we can never win

But ohh, I feel so alive
Ohh, just wanna hold you
Hold you so tight

And I'm flying so high
High off the ground
When you're around

And I can feel you're high
Touching me inside
And it's too much to hide

And I'm flying so high
High off the ground
When you're around
