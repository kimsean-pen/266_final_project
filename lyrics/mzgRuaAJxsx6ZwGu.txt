Hello, I'm your martyr, will you be my gangster?
Can you feel my trigger hand
Moving further down your back?

When you hide, hide inside that body
But just remember that when I touch you
The more you shake, the more you give away

Cold but I'm still here, blind 'cause I'm so blind
Say never we're far from comfortable this time
Cold, now we're so cold, mine and you're not mine
Say never we're far from obvious this time

Wait another minute here, time will kill us after all
Now can you feel it's second hand
Wrapped around your neck?

So fall into my eyes and fall into my lies
But don't you forget the more you turn away
The more I want you to stay

Cold but I'm still here, blind 'cause I'm so blind
Say never we're far from comfortable this time
Cold, now we're so cold, mine and you're not mine
Say never we're far from obvious this time

You're so endearing, you're so beautiful
Well, I don't look like they do
And I don't love like they do
But I don't hate like they do
Am I ever on your mind?

Cold but I'm still here, blind 'cause I'm so blind
Say never we're far from comfortable this time
Cold, now we're so cold, mine and you're not mine
Say never we're far from obvious this time
Cold, you broke me from the very first night
I'd love you 'til the day that I die
We're far too comfortable this time
Cold, I loved you from the very first night
You broke me 'til the day that I die
I'm far too obvious this time
