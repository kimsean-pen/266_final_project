Did you hear that?
A knock at the door
Could that be death?
Knocking at my doorstep

Do I smell fear?
The sights that you hold dear
Could that be me?
Fighting, so beautifully

Run, run, run
He's at the door
Can't get away, get away from this place
Run, run, run
He's at the door
Can't get away, get away from this place
Can't get away, get away from this place
Can't get away, get away from this place
