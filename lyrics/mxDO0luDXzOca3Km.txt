Every time I end up breaking you
You change into something worth keeping
Every time I'm close to saving you
You grow into a sin worth believing

You're everything I ever wanted
But it's never enough, you're never enough
I'll take whatever I can take
Whenever I can take it if it ever comes

I hate you when you're gone, I hate you turn me on
I hate the way I need you when I don't know where you are
I love it even more when I find you on the floor
I know you think you hate me but I will always hate you more

I never knew until I got a taste
What a waste for what I had been through
'Cause nothing ever really makes that change
I'm so ashamed of what I did to you

I had to let you in to feel that rush
You were too much, way too much
I'll take whatever I can take
Whenever I can take it if it ever comes

I hate you when you're gone, I hate you turn me on
I hate the way I need you when I don't know where you are
I love it even more when I find you on the floor
I know you think you hate me but I will always hate you more

I never knew until I got a taste
I'm so ashamed of what I did to you

I hate you when you're gone, I hate you turn me on
I hate the way I need you when I don't know where you are
I love it even more when I find you on the floor
I know you think you hate me but I will always hate you more

I hate you when you're gone, I hate you turn me on
I hate the way I need you when I don't know where you are
I love it even more when I find you on the floor
I know you think you hate me but I will always hate you more
