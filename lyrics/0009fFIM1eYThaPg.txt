It's a sunny day, so I got nowhere to hide
Not a cloud in the sky
So I'm pretending, I've got something in my eyes
Just so you won't see me cry

So I wait for the storm, ooh
To hide all my tears but it's taking too long
But I won't run for the door, ooh
'Cause if you think I'm weak then that makes you strong

(So rain on me)
What's the price of thunder?
(Rain on me)
It's like I'm waiting in a hundred degrees

(So rain on me)
I'll be standing under
(So rain on me)
Disguise my tears so that you'll never see

Let it rain
(Let it rain, let it rain on me, let it rain, let it rain on me)
Let it rain
(My tears are the rainfall and flow right to the sea)

Let it rain
(Let it rain, let it rain on me, let it rain, let it rain on me)
Let it rain
(My tears are the rainfall and flow right to the sea)

I won't give you the pleasure to see me breaking
And that's how you'll remember me
You're not worth it I'll get better, only down for a second
I won't give you the victory

So I wait for the storm, ooh
To hide all my tears but it's taking too long
But I won't run for the door, ooh
'Cause if you think I'm weak then that makes you strong

(So rain on me)
What's the price of thunder?
(Rain on me)
It's like I'm waiting in a hundred degrees

(So rain on me)
I'll be standing under
(Rain on me)
Disguise my tears so that you'll never see

Let it rain
(Let it rain, let it rain on me, let it rain, let it rain on me)
Let it rain
My tears are the rainfall and flow right to the sea)

Let it rain
(Let it rain, let it rain on me, let it rain, let it rain on me)
Let it rain
(My tears are the rainfall and flow right to the sea)

It's a sunny day, so I've got nowhere to hide
Not a cloud in the sky
So I'm pretending, I've got something in my eye
Just so you won't see me cry

(So rain on me)
What's the price of thunder?
(Rain on me)
It's like I'm waiting in a hundred degrees

(So rain on me)
I'll be standing under
(So rain on me)
Disguise my tears so that you'll never see

Let it rain
(Let it rain, let it rain on me, let it rain, let it rain on me)
Let it rain
(My tears are the rainfall and flow right to the sea)

Let it rain
(Let it rain, let it rain on me, let it rain, let it rain on me)
Let it rain
(My tears are the rainfall and flow right to the sea)

Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, ohh, yeah
(Let it rain, let it rain on me, let it rain, let it rain on me)
(My tears are the rainfall and flow right to the sea)
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
(Let it rain, let it rain on me, let it rain, let it rain on me)
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
(My tears are the rainfall and flow right to the sea)
