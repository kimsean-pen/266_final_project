I live a life alone
Nothing is real
Nobody's home
Some things remain like stone
And never picking up the phone

These walls are sick of me
Got nothing left to offer oh but
Don't you want to think you're free
I'd rather dream, oh can't you see?

Always
Always
Always

I live a life alone
Where nothing ever seems to go
This bed this floor await my head
How does it feel?
Nothing is real

I guess we'll never know
I guess you'll never know
I guess we'll never know
I guess you'll never know
