ain't it funny how
I Walk through
call me your waiter
follow you

you were fast around the curve
pulling through the weight
knew the first was hard to say
you've past the haze

and it feels good
too much to take
can't shake this
feeling away
sensations
carried away
it's almost
too much to take

its a phase how
I want you
all of the ways that
are true

you were fast around the curve
pulling through the weight
knew the first was hard to say
you've past the haze

and it feels good
too much to take
can't shake this
feeling away
sensations
carried away
it's almost
too much to take X2
