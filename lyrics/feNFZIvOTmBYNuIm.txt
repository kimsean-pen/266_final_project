She's a cabaret Queen they can't touch her,
People spot her from a long way,
And she knows how to keep 'em hanging on.
She sing they favorite song,
Like that's my favorite song,
She's no caricature.
They grab her by the shoulder,
She tell 'em to hold up,
She don't around.
Ooh, she keep them coming,
Ooh, she keep me coming,
Tastes like gold, I just can't get enough.
She keep me coming-oo,
She keep me running-oo,
Oh, nanana!
I'm watching every episode,
I'm in the crowd under a shroud of smoke,
I'm barely holding on till that after show.
Guess you can say I'm Jonesing,
For a girl named Baby Jones,
And they all take a piece,
Tryna plagiarize a bitch.
Gimmie all day blues,
Cause she focused on the green,
Hope she coming home with me,
I need more of it.
Cause it tastes like gold,
I just can't get enough.
Can't say no,
She keep me coming-oo,
She keep me running-oo,
Oh, nanana.
That bitch clean she mean she the baddest,
The one a teen she the gleam try to grab it,
Tryna come up on it.
Cause she know she never had it,
I'm just out here waiting hoping,
That you make it back intact.
