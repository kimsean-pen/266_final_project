You make me lose control
Your fingers on my bones
I'm slippin' through the floor
So baby, don't crush me
'Cause there's no exit here
Nowhere to disappear
There's not a single tear
So baby, don't crush me

It's just the way you are
The way that you walk
The way that you talk
The way that you read me, baby
And honey
Don't hide that look in your eyes
Darlin', it drives me crazy
Don't crush, don't crush me
No, say you'll remain

I'll let you take the wheel
My heart is yours to steal
I know this is real, so baby, don't crush me
The pedal's to the floor
And now we're heading north
I've been down this road before
So baby, don't crush me

It's just the way you are
The way that you walk
The way that you talk
The way that you, you read me, baby
And honey, don't hide that look in your eyes
Darlin', it, it drives me crazy
Don't crush (Don't crush)
Don't crush me, no (Don't crush me, no)
Say you'll remain my love

And now that I finally found ya
(I just can't live without ya)
You're making me so all about ya
(I just can't live without ya)
I don't know what I gotta do if I ain't got you

Because it's just the way you are
The way that you walk
The way that you talk
The way that you, you read me, baby
And honey, don't hide that look in your eyes
Darlin', it, it drives me crazy
Say you'll remain my love
Don't let my heart break and crush

Don't crush (The way that you walk)
Don't crush me (The way that you talk)
No (The way that you, you read me baby)
'Cause I've crushed
(And honey, don't hide that look in your eyes)
I've crushed, oh (Darlin' it, it drives me crazy)

Don't crush, 'cause I've crushed
Ooh, ooh, ah
