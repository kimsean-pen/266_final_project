Darkness falls and she will take me by the hand
Take me to some twilight land
Where all but love is grey
Where I can't find my way
Without her as my guide

Night falls I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn and burn eternally

She's a mystery to me
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl

In the night of love words tangled in her hair
Words soon to disappear
A love so sharp it cut
Like a switchblade to my heart
Words tearing me apart

She tears again my bleeding heart
I want to run she's pulling me apart
Fallen angel cries and I just melt away

She's a mystery to me
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl

Haunted by her side is the darkness in her eyes
That so enslaves me
But if my love is blind
Then I don't want to see
She's a mystery to me

Night falls I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn and burn eternally

She's a mystery to me
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl

She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl

She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
