Bless my cotton socks I'm in the news
The king sits on his face
but it's all assumed
All wrapped up the same
All wrapped up the same
They can't have it
You can't have it
I can't have it too
Until I learn to accept my reward

Prisoners stand in queues
and stand in queues
Live in solitude like Howard Hughes
All wrapped up the same
All wrapped up the same
Silence has it
Arrogance has it
I can't have it ooh
Until I learn to accept my reward

Suddenly it struck me very clear
Suddenly it struck me very clean
All wrapped up the same
All wrapped up the same
They can't have it
You can't have it
I can't have it too
Until I learn to accept my reward
