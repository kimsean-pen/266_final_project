Juicy...
I walked into the party
I seen somethin' I never saw (juicy)
Everybody was movin', groovin
Girls, they were dancin' on the bar
Now this wasn't no ordinary dance
Hey man why is everybody swimmin' in a trance?
I couldn't figure it out like your grandpa's riddle
I asked 'em what they doing and they said Juicy Wiggle!
(Now move your hips and dance like fish)

Get juicy
Get juicy
Yeah, get juicy

Get juicy
Get juicy
Yeah, get juicy

Woooo Weeeii!
Now I done just lost my mind
All those people wigglin' they stuff
(Hey man, you gonna do the dance?)
Man turn down for what!?
Give me a shot (woo!)
Another shot (woo!)
Y'all ain't ready for me to show you what I got (woo!)
Then my body froze up, it was getting to my head
What if I can't do it?
Then everybody said...

Ah, get juicy
Ah, get juicy
Ah, get juicy
Ah, get juicy
Two girls was shakin' it, I jumped in the middle
I asked em what they doing an they said
Juicy Wiggle!

Get juicy
Get juicy
Yeah, get juicy

Get juicy
Get juicy
Yeah, get juicy

Right about now
We really gonn' have some fun! (Oh Yeah?)
I'm talking bout ticklin' ivory (woo!)
But first, I need some 151 and a match (wooo weeeii!)
It's time to light it up, lets go now!

Ah, get juicy
Ah, get juicy
Ah, get juicy
Ah, get juicy
Ain't nothing wrong with making it jiggle
So when the beats drops everybody
Juicy Wiggle!

Get juicy
Get juicy
Yeah, get juicy
Get juicy
Get juicy

So when the beat drops, everybody Juicy Wiggle
Yeah, baby
Wooo!
