We all have sins
That's why we pray for forgiveness

We're part of team eight
Those deadly sins we try to break
We're crushed by the weight
Of the sinner chains we make
Condemned to be slaves
We'll give in again
We'll never escape
Cause we're members of team eight
Yes we're members of team eight

You left one vice out
This one makes you feel nice
It's Vanity Shout your need to be famed and glorified

Tweets and hashtags
To convince others that you're amazing so...
We all have sins
That's why we pray for forgiveness

We're part of team eight
Those deadly sins we try to break
We're crushed by the weight
Of the sinner chains we make
Condemned to be slaves
We'll give in again
We'll never escape
Cause we're members of team eight
Yes we're members of team eight
