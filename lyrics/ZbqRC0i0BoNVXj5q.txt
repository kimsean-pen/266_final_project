She's a doll in ever after[?]
She's a ghost inside of me
There was shouting in her head and
And now i watch her disapear
I, sweet girl, I know you
Know me
And would I leave her to the slaughter
Is it part of my disease
Now there's someone in our bedroom
And I haven't got the key
I, sweet girl, i know you
Know me
I, sweet girl, i know you
Know me
Callin someone took their effort tho[?]
Callin someone took their effort tho[?]
I, sweet girl, i know you
Know me
I, sweet girl, i know you
