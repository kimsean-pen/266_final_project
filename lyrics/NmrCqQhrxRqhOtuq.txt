It's like a part of me has died
Now I will fall on my knees
I drill holes in myself
I drill holes in myself
Just to get out

Searchlights are following me
Now I can't hide
The haunting begins
I crawl over myself
I crawl over myself
Just to get out

And, oh
I'm broken and bitter now
I completely failed
I completely failed

Suppose I'm faking this feeling now
That I'm beaten down
I'm beaten down
(I'll) stop trying to hold out for more

It's like you stopped
Apologizing
My blood runs dry
The fallout begins
And I hope you'll be last
And I hope you'll be last
As I get out

The strength you had
Was borrowed from me
The hatred now is swallowing me
I'll dispose of myself
(I'll) dispose of myself
Just to get out

And, oh
I'm broken and bitter now
I completely failed
I completely failed

Suppose I'm faking this feeling now
That I'm beaten down
I'm beaten down
