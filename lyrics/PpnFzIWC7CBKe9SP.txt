Every afternoon
you sat your stuff down on the table
I wonder what you're up tonight
Father is a neighbour
Ooooh
It's coming back to me
The morning-dogs hollow sound
When day's almost over
It's been a long time
That love's no longer mine
But it's still yours
Ooooh, in a fable
In a fable
They say things end, that's how it's s'posed to be
I'm nodding yes, you know I don't agree
Just in a fable
Just in a fable
When mothers gone, we'll pack your things and leave
