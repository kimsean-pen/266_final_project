Give us solitude
From the car

Hey now, you gotta listen to me fade ya
(Am I wrong?)
If you won't start making right, I'll give a third call
(Am I wrong?)
Hey now, I found the questions that may know I'm wrong
(Am I wrong?)
Who cares if I don't fit into the k-hole?
(Am I wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong?)

Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong

From the car
From the, from the, from the car

Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong

Hey now, you gotta listen to me fade ya
(Am I wrong?)
If you won't start making right, I'll give a third call
(Am I wrong?)
Hey now, I found the questions that may know I'm wrong
(Am I wrong?)
Who cares if I don't fit into the k-hole?
(Am I wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong?)

Give us solitude

Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
