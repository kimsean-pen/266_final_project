Oooh oooh yeah
Oooh oooh yeah
I can't help myself!

Verse 1:
Looking in my mirror
Took me by surprise
I can't help but see you
Running often through my mind

Verse 2:
Helpless like a baby
Sensual disguise
I can't help but love you
It's getting better all the time!

Chorus X2
But I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no.

Love makes me feel sooo strong. Oooh ooh

Verse 3:
Love to run my fingers
Softly while you sigh
Love came and possessed you
Bringing sparkles to your eyes.

Verse 4:
Like a trip to heaven
Heaven is the prize
And I'm so glad I found you girl
You're an angel in disguise.

Chorus X2
But I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no. Oooh ooh

I-i-i just can't help myself, uhmmm
Oooh oooh
Can't help it!
