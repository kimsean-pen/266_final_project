Staring eyes wide open, gazing into nothing, running in place again
Going through the motions, in and out as the oceans, repeating
Numb to the silence, to the absence of emotion
The sum of the script, nothing but a click in the rotation, yeah
Sick of the peace of mind that goes along with keeping on, and I
Can't keep on keeping on

Inside feels like I'm stuck here suspended, at best underwhelming, what's wrong with me?
My conscious is calling, but the world isn't all, it's cracked up to be
I'm hopelessly hopeful
That I'm not stuck here suspended, in a world I pretended was right for me, for me

What's wrong with me?

Strung out on the same old, got an itch for something painful
To feel something real once, to remind myself it's not in my head
Sick of the calm coinciding with sticking in and with the line
Can't keep on keeping on, it all just

Feels like I'm stuck here suspended, at best underwhelming, what's wrong with me?
My conscious is calling, but the world isn't all, it's cracked up to be
I'm hopelessly hopeful
That I'm not stuck here suspended, in a world I pretended was right for me, for me

What's wrong with me?
When I close my eyes
When I leave the light

Inside it feels like I'm stuck here suspended, at best underwhelming, what's wrong with me?
My conscious is calling, but the world isn't all it's cracked up to be
I'm hopelessly hopeful
That I'm not stuck here suspended in a world I pretended was right for me, for me
