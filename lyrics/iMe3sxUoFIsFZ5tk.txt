Been blessed and I've been cursed
I'm reaching passed the same grade
Get undressed 'cause I've been hurt
And I'm sure we're more alike these days

True to blood and form
These mistakes I would pay for
Taking good from scorn
I would want you to have more
Been warned of this habit
But I'll make what I can of this love
And they'll talk of the damage
And leave nothing at all to speak of
Been blessed and I've been cursed
Reaching passed the same grade
Undressed 'cause I've been hurt
And I'm sure we're more alike these days
Been warned of this habit
But I'll make what I can of this love
And they'll talk of the damage
And leave nothing at all to speak of
Thin air I'll share with those who care
Much less to stare
Poor form to poor scorn there
Thin air I'll share with those who care
Much less to stare
Poor form to poor scorn there
Thin air I'll share with those who care
Much less to stare
Poor form to poor scorn there
True to blood and form,
These mistakes I get paid for
Taking good from scorn
I know that I have more
True to blood and form,
These mistakes I get paid for
Taking good from scorn
I know that I have more
