Good Day Sunshine
Good Day Sunshine
Good Day Sunshine

I need to laugh
And when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good

In a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day
Good Day Sunshine

Good Day Sunshine
Good Day Sunshine

We take a walk
The sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

Good Day Sunshine
Good Day Sunshine
Good Day Sunshine
Then we lie

Beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good

She knows, she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine
Good Day Sunshine
Good Day Sunshine
Good Day Sunshine
Good Day Sunshine
Good Day Sunshine
Good Day Sunshine
Good Day Sunshine (Good Day Sunshine)
Good Day Sunshine (Good Day Sunshine)
