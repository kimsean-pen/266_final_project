I watched you bathing in the moonlight
I heard you crying in the wind
Oh, every day is just another symphony
Of angels singing praises in your name
Look up, can't you hear them calling

It wasn't very long ago
That you and I believed in the same things
And now it seems, you've put our love behind you
And turned away before you understood
You can run, but you can't hide

Chorus:
Can't you see I'm falling down
Thanks to things I never knew
Don't you know I'm tryin' hard
To take this love from you

Oh, the skies are falling
And the seas are drying
Oh, oh, can it be?
The world stopped turning on me

Well, I see you still but that's just fantasy
I hear you call to someone else
Oh, gazing at a distant cold reflection
And crystal lakes of tears I cried for you
Trying to keep this hope alive

Chorus
Solo
Chorus
(Repeat)
