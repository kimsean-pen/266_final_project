This time I'll try not to get hurt
This time I'll stay untouched with pain and dirt
This time I'll stick to what I've learned
This time I'll fly so low I won't get burned

Maybe it's not enough
Maybe this time it's just too much
Maybe I'm not that tough
Maybe this time the road is just too rough
To walk down
So I sit down

I've walked this road so many years
I've worn down all my boots, I've cried all tears
So many crossroads left behind
So many choices burned into my mind

Maybe it's not enough
Maybe this time it's just too much
Maybe I'm not that tough
Maybe this time the road is just too rough
To take me home
To take me home
To take me home
To take me home
But I walk on
