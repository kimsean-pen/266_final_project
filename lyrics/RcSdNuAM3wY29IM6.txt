Like thunder
Cracking down
Night coming over
From my fears
Oh, they glow
Can't let the waters flow
And I can't learn to keep it down

And I can't believe it
Not to receive it
After all
All the recalled dreams
Stop it all
Diamond springs

Nights are thin
Days are gone
Hearts burning older
Through these arms
Water falls, water falls, water falls

And I can't believe it
Not to receive it
After all
All the recalled dreams
Stop it all
Diamond springs

Make it far
Break in doors
On the floor
(In the stars)

Hey now,
I can see it coming
I can see it (Ah)

Hey now,
I can see it coming
I can see it (Ah)

Hey now,
I can see it coming
I can see it (Ah)

Hey now,
I can see it coming
I can see it (Ah)
