Made to open to meet it
You come and show the eye
Get myself on [?]

Three o'clock, doing [?] anyone
[?] even fake when
[?] wanna get the real thing later

Oh no, I'm just like anyone
I never say that I wanna be a hero
You got me wrong, you heard me wrong
You heard me wrong

I knew his name wasn't Johnny
I tease him "hey Joe, what do you know?"
I really like him, he always has something
Something to tell me

Some nights I stay up all night
I tell [?] don't have a story
He takes control, he likes the control over me
What is that

Three o'clock, doing [?] anyone
[?] even fake when
[?] we can get the real thing later

Oh no, I'm just like anyone
I never say that I wanna be a hero
You got me wrong, you heard me wrong
You heard me wrong

Some nights I stay up all night
I tell [?] don't have a story
He takes control, he likes the control over me
That is that

I knew his name wasn't Johnny
I tease him "hey Joe, what do you know?"
I really like him, he always has something
Something to tell me
