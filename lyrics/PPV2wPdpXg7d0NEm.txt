Oh, I think I know you
I think I know you like I never knew before
Oh, I think I love you
I think I love you like I never loved before
Oh, I think I know you
I think I know you like I never knew before
Oh, I think I love you
I think I love you like I never loved before

Oh, I think I know you
I think I know you like I never knew before
Armageddon, Armageddon
Armageddon, let's take drugs and go to war

Oh, I think I love you
I think I love you like I never loved before
Armageddon, Armageddon
Armageddon, let's take drugs and go to war

I'm a sly guy in disguise
All you people that can't realize
Like a cool cool feel feel under my skin
Everybody loves sin

When you go where you don't belong
Into moods that will make you ill
And you don't want to socialize
You just want to fuck and kill

Oh, I think I know you
I think I know you like I never knew before
Armageddon, Armageddon
Armageddon, let's take drugs and go to war

Oh, I think I love you
I think I love you like I never loved before
Armageddon, Armageddon
Armageddon, let's take drugs and go to war

I'm a sly guy in disguise
All you people that can't realize
Like a cool cool feel feel under my skin
Everybody loves sin

When you go where you don't belong
Into moods that will make you ill
And you don't want to socialize
You just want to fuck and kill

Oh, I think I know you
I think I know you like I never knew before
Oh, I think I love you
I think I love you like I never loved before
Oh, I think I know you
I think I know you like I never knew before
Oh, I think I love you
I think I love you like I never loved before

Oh, I think I know you
I think I know you like I never knew before
Armageddon, Armageddon
Armageddon, let's take drugs and go to war

Let's take drugs and go to war
Let's take drugs and go to war
Armageddon, let's take drugs and go to war
Armageddon, let's take drugs and go to war
