My lightning conceived was I
The stars above became my eyes
Overgelmer flows in my veins
My hair the mist across the never ending nameless lake

By womb of soil, the moist of dew
Born when sun was high, the day was new
And the raven soared high up in clear sky
The lamb will speak to you, when your heart is pure
And you were made by

Mother Earth, Father Thunder

This heart winged, I am eagles son
Through storm and syite, untouched, it is pounding on
This sword, forged in fire and ice
The runes that trail its blade can be seen but by my two eyes

As if written in the snow, the lies, shall melt away
By the wheel of sun to cross the sky this day
Shadows may lay heavy upon the earth
But the truth, cut deep in stone, will last
Till the heavens comes tumbling down upon this world

Mother Earth, Father Thunder
