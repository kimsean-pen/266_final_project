I'm touching you, boy
You're touching me
The windows fogged up we can barely see
I'm thinking 'bout you, boy
Thinking 'bout me
They say I'm crazy, I'm just day dreaming
'Bout you and me
I'm just day dreaming us
Here, through reality, I'm just day dreaming
'Bout you and me
I'm just day dreaming us
Here, through reality, I'm just day dreaming
I close my eyes
My heart's like a sunrise
Take me so high
Can't speak, I'm tongue-tied
Take a ride going nowhere
Kissing at the stoplights
You adore the way you stare
This affair is one of a kind
I'm touching you, boy (touching you, boy)
You're touching me (touching me)
The windows fogged up we can barely see (barely see)
I'm thinking 'bout you, boy
Thinking 'bout me (thinking about me)
They say I'm crazy, I'm just day dreaming
'Bout you and me
I'm just day dreaming us
Here, through reality, I'm just day dreaming
'Bout you and me
I'm just day dreaming us
Here, through reality, I'm just day dreaming
Roses and wine
Say I'm your valentine
Then we can climb
Love letters in my mind
I wear your t-shirts
Leave my earrings behind
Our song plays all day
And I just want to say
I'm touching you, boy (touching you, boy)
You're touching me (touching me)
The windows fogged up we can barely see (barely see)
I'm thinking 'bout you, boy
Thinking 'bout me (thinking about me)
They say I'm crazy, I'm just day dreaming
'Bout you and me
I'm just day dreaming us
Here, through reality, I'm just day dreaming
'Bout you and me
I'm just day dreaming us
Here, through reality, I'm just day dreaming
