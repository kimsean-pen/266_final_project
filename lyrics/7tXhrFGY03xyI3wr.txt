Yeah, I'm a fighter and I made it through
Solid gold survivor, that's my attitude
But I didn't know (I didn't know)
I didn't know (I didn't know)
That I had to be your hero
Baby, don't ask me to be strong for you aswell
Pushed off the edge and now I'm back from hell
But I didn't know (I didn't know)
I didn't know (I didn't know)
That I had to be your hero

(So give me light)
I'm not built to carry us both
(So give me light)
Time to rest my weary bones
(So give me light)
You've got to find your own road
Help me see

Just when I thought I'd had enough
And no more light and no more love
It's not over
It's not over
I won't save you when I'm weak
Only got so much left to give
It's not over
It's not over

Til I'm done
Til I'm done
Til I'm done

You look at me and see how much I take
But with this heart of glass, I'm about to break
But I didn't know (I didn't know)
I didn't know (I didn't know)
That I had to be your hero

(So give me light)
I'm not built to carry us both
(So give me light)
Time to rest my weary bones
(So give me light)
You've got to find your own road
Help me see

Just when I thought I'd had enough
And no more light and no more love
It's not over
It's not over
I won't save you when I'm weak
Only got so much left to give
It's not over
It's not over

Til I'm done
Til I'm done
Til I'm done

Whatcha think you ever did for me before?
(So give me light)
Block out the sun and let the moon fall on the floor
(So give me light)
I am empty, ain't got nothing left to give
(So give me light)
And no you ain't the one I wanna be with

Just when I thought I'd had enough
And no more light and no more love
It's not over
It's not over
I won't save you when I'm weak
Only got so much left to give
It's not over
It's not over

Just when I thought I'd had enough
And no more light and no more love
It's not over
It's not over
I won't save you when I'm weak
Only got so much left to give
It's not over
It's not over

Til I'm done
Til I'm done
Til I'm done
