[Composition: Kallio, Santeri]

This long road
Paved with victories
These monuments
Named after heroes
On this spring-like night
When the trees are blooming
I languish upon this road
I perish on the icy path

Who are you
Why have you called me here
(And the wind steals the sound)
And this long road
Where are you leading me
(And the snow erases the tracks)

It leads the way
Tireless through the dusk
Forces me to carry on
Flowers wither... lights and stars go out
I blindly fall down
Into the abyss of sleep and death

Why I'm the one
The chose one... When I'm no one

I strain to, to hear the call
But the wind steals the sound
I strive to, to keep on trail
And the snow erases the tracks
