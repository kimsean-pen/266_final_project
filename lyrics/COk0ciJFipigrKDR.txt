Come with it now
Come with it now

The microphone explodes, shattering the molds
Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenching, quenching the thirst
Of the power dons - that five sided Fist-a-gon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The triggers cold empty your purse

Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
No need, just feed the war cannibal animal
I walk the corner to the rubble, that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetery now
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and moving
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally 'round the family, pocket full of shells

Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
Listen

Birds chirpin', dogs barkin', kids missin', milk cartons
Soul dark as black markets, war is startin', more is sparkin'
Historic prophets praise Muhammad
Diff'rent Strokes, Philip Drummond
Gave me crack, like I'm plumbin', Jesus Christ, second comin'
Cut myself, now I'm numbin', never scared, never runnin'
Chosen one, I'm one hunnid, pray for me, pray for London
Guilty me, he ain't done and gun me down, all for nothin'
President in abundance, president is a puppet
Gotta hate it, gotta love it, pass a class, I rise above it
Wise enough, advise the public, pistol bust, screamin' "fuck it"
Donald Trump, Donald Duck, what the fuck is the difference?
Now we stuck, in a rut, this ain't what I envisioned
What is what? What is guts when you don't have intuition?
Not a saint, not a sin, tell me what's my real religion?
Genocide, Genesis, they say it's a new beginning
I'm a sinner, you a sinner, I can see the devil grinning

Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
