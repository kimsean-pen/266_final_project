Another drink another roller dice
Another night I paid the price
And too many times I turned way good advice
Give me just a little more time

I fell in love only once in my life
We'd never fight, well maybe once or twice
Then he came along now this whiskey is my wife
Give me just little more time

All my regrets carry weight
I'm broke and tired of losing my faith
Lit cigarette with her lipstick stain
Whispering sadly to me

All my regrets carry weight
I'm broke and tired of losing my faith
Lit cigarette with her lipstick stain
Whispering sadly to me

Curtain call end of the show
It's 4am, and I'm here alone
Bartender please I've got nowhere else to go
Give me just a little more time
