I moved your picture
From my walls
And I replaced them
Both large and small
And each new day
Finds me so blue
Nothing nothing
Takes the place of you

I read your letters one by one
And I still love you
When it's all said and done
And oh, my darling, I'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh nothing
Takes the place of you

I, I write this letter
It's raining on my window pane
And I feel the need of you
Because without you
Nothing seems the same

So I'll wait
Until you're home
Again I love you
Yes I will
But I'm all alone
And oh my darling
I'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh, but nothing takes the place of you.

Nothing baby
Nothing takes the place of you
No-one in this world takes the place of you
Nothing takes the place of you
