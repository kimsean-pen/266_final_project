Come what may we've lived a lifetime
What matters to me?
Forget the future I've made my mind
You're all that i see
Waves come crashing down and the
Winds scream round and round but
I'll wait out this storm
I'll wait out this storm with you

I'm not leaving any more
I've found its you I'm fighting for
And even if this is the end
I swear I'll never leave your side again

Come what will I've had enough now
Whats left to decide?
Faced with this there is no question
I'd choose you every
Time comes crashing down
And our world burns to the ground
But I'll wait out this storm
I'll wait out this storm for you

I'm not leaving any more
I've found its you I'm fighting for
And even if this is the end
I swear I'll never leave your side again

I'm not leaving any more
I've found its you I'm fighting for
And if this really is the end
I swear I'll never leave your side again
