Meddle with my heart if you want to
I know you hate it when I'm drunk
But, it's not easy
I wanna feel
Something different for once

I know my heart is killing you, killing you
I can't help it
'Cause I'm feeling you, feeling you
Oh, honey, please don't say you're gonna leave me
Honey, please don't say you're gonna leave me

I would give you my body
But am I sure that you want me
Am I sure that you want me?
I would give you my body
But am I sure that you want me
Am I sure that you want me?

I would give you my body
But am I sure that you want me
Am I sure that you want me?
And I would give you my body
But am I sure that you want me
Am I sure that you want me?

Oh, when you lie awake
'Cause I ruined your night
Well, honey, that's what I'm good at
Now you're not answering
'Cause I ruined your mind
Well, honey, you knew I'd do that

I would give you my body
But am I sure that you want me
Am I sure that you want me?
And I would give you my body
But am I sure that you want me
Am I sure that you want me?

And there's somebody that you're after
And you see, I'd like to keep your heart for me
And there's somebody that I'm after
And the karma can wait
I wanna see
Does she know?

I would give you my body
But am I sure that you want me
Am I sure that you want me?
And I would give you my body
But am I sure that you want me
Am I sure that you want me?

I would give you my body
But am I sure that you want me
Am I sure that you want me?
And I would give you my body
But am I sure that you want me
Am I sure that you want me?
