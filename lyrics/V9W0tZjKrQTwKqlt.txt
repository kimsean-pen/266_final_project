Through moors and mists of deception
The uninitiated are conjoined
Illusive bliss feeds obsession
A feeble orientation is provoked
Is provoked

Inflammatory bonds will be broken
Being the shepherd no more
Yearning for that ever glowing token
In ongoing lore

Images appear before my eyes
At any given time
Burdened bearing all their lies
Leaping laughter and secret smiles

Inflammatory bonds will be broken
Being the shepherd no more
Yearning for that ever glowing token
In ongoing lore

The treasure lies not in regression
But in reaching the levels of becoming
That harbored within us for centuries
Centuries of long lost knowing

The treasure lies not in regression
But in reaching the levels of becoming
That harbored within us for centuries
Centuries of long lost knowing
In ongoing lore

Spirit and matter defined
Spirit and matter refined

Through moors and mists of deception
The uninitiated are conjoined
Illusive bliss feeds obsession
A feeble orientation is provoked
Is provoked, is provoked

The inflammatory bonds will be broken
Being the shepherd no more
Yearning for that ever glowing token
In ongoing lore

The upper planes accessed
Insight and co-alliance addressed
Spirit and matter defined
Spirit and matter refined
