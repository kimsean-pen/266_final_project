Remember when ninth grade was about gettin' laid
Skippin' class tryin' not to get caught?
Now you gotta take a test in a bullet proof vest
Scared to death that you might get shot
It's like I just closed my eyes
Everybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise
That hides behind the lines
That hide the truth and I just can't take it no more

So wake me up from this American bad dream
Is it this messed up, or is it really reality?
I'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up from this American bad dream
From this American bad dream

I remember goin' 10 over the limit would just get you a ticket
Just an inconvenience gettin' stopped
Bad cops played the jury, made the good ones worry
About showin' up and doin' their job
It's like I just closed my eyes
Everybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise
That hides behind the lines
That hide the truth now I just can't take it no more

So wake me up from this American bad dream
Is it this messed up, or is it really reality?
I'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up from this American bad dream
Yeah this American bad dream
From this American bad dream, oh

It's like I just closed my eyes
Everybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise
Damn

So wake me up from this American bad dream
Is it this messed up, or is it really reality?
I'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up from this American bad dream
From this American bad dream
Wake me up, wake me up
Wake me up from this American bad dream
From this American bad dream
