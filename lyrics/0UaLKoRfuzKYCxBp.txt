Mut the dangerous dead
Trouble me no longer
I inscribe thy name
I threaten thee with the second death
I kill thy name
And thus I kill thee again
In the afterlife

Bau terror of the living
Angry spirits of the condemned dead
I write thy name
I burn thy name in flames
I kill thy name
And thus thee are accursed
Even into the underworld

Mut the troublesome dead
Plague me no longer
Thou art cursed
Thy name is crushed
Thine clay is smashed and broken
Thy vegeance against the living
Shall come to naught
