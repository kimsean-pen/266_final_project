Penny for your thoughts, I know what you want
I can read your mind even from behind
And fuck what's in your phone, let me take you home
I wanna take you home

'Cause it's so rare that im here, don't plan on staying to long
So you should come here, sit yo' ass on this throne
This a special affair, better act like you know who I am, who I am

I bet this patron make you feel nice and comfortable
Tryna act nice, girl your cover's blown
But you already knew that, you already knew that, you already knew that

We can burn one
We can burn one

Laying in the dark, I might break your heart
I can get you high if you wanna climb
'Cause fuck what's in your phone, let me take you home
I wanna take you home

'Cause it's so rare that im here, don't plan on staying to long
So you should come here, sit yo' ass on this throne
This a special affair, better act like you know who I am, who I am

I bet this patron make you feel nice and comfortable
Tryna act nice, girl your cover's blown
But you already knew that, you already knew that, you already knew that
I bet this patron make you feel nice and comfortable
Tryna act nice, girl your cover's blown
But you already knew that, you already knew that, you already knew that

We can burn one
We can burn one

I bet this patron
I bet this patron
