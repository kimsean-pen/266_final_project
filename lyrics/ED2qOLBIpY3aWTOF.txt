I wrote another song about you
But God knows I didn't want to
And you talk and you talk doesn't make any sense
'cos I'm not ready yeah I'm not ready
You had chance after chance but still sat on the fence
And you've had plenty yeah way too many from me

You know I can't stay sober stay sober
Drowning in the memory of you
Feelings start to take over take over
Use me to misuse and abuse
'cos I've got nothing to lose

You came to my house tonight
Threw rocks at my window til first light
Because the taste on my lips is a thought that persists
Your words are poison and tongue a shotgun
Try my best to resist why can't we coexist
You're the shadow I'm the sun
Some things you can't outrun

Stay sober stay sober
Drowning in the memory of you
Feelings start to take over take over
Use me to misuse and abuse
'cos I've got nothing to lose

I'm done with faking my laughter
Living in Awful Ever After

I'm done with faking my laughter
Living in Awful Ever After

No I can't stay sober
Stay sober
Stay sober
Stay sober
Stay sober
Stay sober
No I can't stay sober
