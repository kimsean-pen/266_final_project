so get your fingers out my fucking face
i fell asleep under the sun again
my heart is colder than it's ever been
my body's burned but i am shivering

so what if i fall?
could you look me in my eyes and say you remembered it all?
back on the road
been to delaware, kansas and arkansas all on my own
the days that go
so let me go
on my own

so get your fingers out my fucking face
i fell asleep under the sun again
my heart is colder than it's ever been
my body's burned but i am shivering
(don't mind me)
(don't mind me)
(don't mind me)
