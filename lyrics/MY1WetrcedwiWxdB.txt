So I've given it up
How could this ever seem so simple
Waiting for love
But now you're the one who's mixing signals

You say that you're sorry
But you're asking what are we
Never enough
And I'm thinking that I can solve this riddle another way

It's not like we're alright
We could be anywhere else tonight

Tell me what we're waiting for
Are we holding up for something more?
Here on the sidelines
We're out on our own time
There's nothing like a crowded road
To make me wanna hop and leave with you
Under the bright lights
'Til here on the sidelines

Was this ever real
Or was it another act you promised
You think I don't feel
But maybe that's what we have in common

You say that you're sorry
But we're back where we started
How do we heal?
I pray I'll be honest with myself another day

It's not like we're alright
We could be anywhere else tonight

Tell me what we're waiting for
Are we holding up for something more?
Here on the sidelines
We're out on our own time
There's nothing like a crowded road
To make me wanna hop and leave with you
Under the bright lights
'Til here on the sidelines

It's not like we're alright
It's just something we're drawn to
Is it worth more than onto
(It's not like we're alright)
If we fend for ourselves
We could be anywhere else tonight

Tell me what we're waiting for
Are we holding up for something more?
Here on the sidelines
We're out on our own time
There's nothing like a crowded road
To make me wanna hop and leave with you
Under the bright lights
'Til here on the sidelines

Under the bright lights
'Til here on the sidelines
Under the bright lights
'Til here on the sidelines
