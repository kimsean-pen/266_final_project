Like a reindeer
Can't seem to keep my nose clear
Coming through your pioneers
Smoking on Columbus call that pioneer
We might be dying here
I heard Santa got shot
He don't got snow
Hit a North Pole, gloryhole for his blow
It's a twisted Christmas
I made a hit list, hit up your mistress like
On the house you can kiss this and I don't know your witness
And if I get that court date
You can count on me to miss it
I'm so over it
Keep your fucking present, wrap a bow 'round this

I'm a sad, sad girl
I'm a strange one
But I thrive in the darkness
And they love when I'm heartless
I'm a sad, sad girl
Not a sane one
Yeah, I thrive in the darkness, thrive in the darkness
I'm a sad, sad girl
I'm a strange one
But I thrive in the darkness
And they love when I'm heartless
I'm a sad, sad girl
Not a sane one
Yeah, I thrive in the darkness, thrive in the darkness

I need some ammunition, bubblegum
I look for trouble cause I like to rumble
Bang, bang
Tongue kissing, till we need stitches
I just wanna take your face off
Wear it like it's face off
I'm on my Pagan shit
Worship Satan with a torch lit
No mistletoe just spliff smoke
Purple stocking stuffer with propane to sip
This what I call a white Christmas
Snowman nose, I think I'm Rudolph bitch
No eggnog, just Sierra Mist
Hi, I'm Lisa bitch

I'm a sad, sad girl
I'm a strange one
But I thrive in the darkness
And they love when I'm heartless
I'm a sad, sad girl
Not a sane one
Yeah, I thrive in the darkness, thrive in the darkness
I'm a sad, sad girl
I'm a strange one
But I thrive in the darkness
And they love when I'm heartless
I'm a sad, sad girl
Not a sane one
Yeah, I thrive in the darkness, thrive in the darkness
