A holiday we could take
We got rooms to break
Everybody wants something more without the pain
And everybody look at her she's been walking around
She'll be the one with the wisdom, the one without the frown
She said, "It's not a reflection of you
It's one of them
Make you feel down for a while but you'll be back up again."
"It's not a reflection of you
It's one of them
Make you feel down for a while but you'll be back up again."

Get up
Take a look around I'm one of you
Just a messed up kid from a run down neighborhood
So I've come down this side
And I'll jam a while
So when I go home tonight
I'll go home in style

She said, "It's not a reflection of you
It's one of them
Make you feel down for a while but you'll be back up again."
"It's not a reflection of you
It's one of them
Make you feel down for a while but you'll be back up again."

Get up
Come down
We could
Come down
Get up
Come down
We could
Get up
Come down
We could
Get up
Come down
Come down
We could
