Torches of war under hatred's sails
A whisper of doom on a wary breeze
Scorching the shores in a blazing trail
Cinder and fume foul the air we breathe

Blood of fallen kings
Blades of chaos ring
Steel and silver sing
For justice

Keen to the scent, the hunt is my muse
A means to an end this path that I choose
Lost and aloof are the loves of my past
Wake the White Wolf!
Remembrance at last

Wake the White Wolf at the dawn of war
The end of the age is-a coming now

Sign of flame will sting
Punishment I bring
Steel and silver sing
For justice

Keen to the scent, the hunt is my muse
A means to an end this path that I choose
Lost and aloof are the loves of my past
Wake the White Wolf!
Remembrance at last

Wake the White Wolf at the dawn of war
The end of the age is-a coming now
Ravaging the rivers scorching the shores
Fires in the night the torches of war

WAKE THE WOLF
WAKE THE WHITE WOLF

Wake the White Wolf at the dawn of war
The end of the age is-a coming now
