And when the time is right
It's gonna change the world
And with the darkened sky
There is nothing fertile
And there is no more love
Or fucking gates of pearls

I see the seven stars
I see the seven stands
I hear the deathly voice
I count the sins we have
I am the living one
I am the first and last

The crowds the noise the change of the guard
It's such a strange celebration
The kids they laugh there's fire it eats up the world
It's such a strange celebration
All our eyes are burned by heaven and earth
It's such a strange celebration

And they know who we are
The seven angels sing
And several billion die
With the earth shaking
Yeah they know who we are
And they will set us free

The crowds the noise the change of the guard
It's such a strange celebration
The kids they laugh there's fire it eats up the world
It's such a strange celebration
All our eyes are burned by heaven and earth
It's such a strange celebration
