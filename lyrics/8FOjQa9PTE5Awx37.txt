I remember when I was lost
Down for the count, was done
Yeah
No one around to pick me up
I was so over love
Till you came right in
And you brought me hope
I ain't never felt this feeling, oooh I'm in yeah

It's crazy
The way you've got the beat of my heart racing
Only love (only love!)
It will build you up
Break you down
Only love (only love)
I will sacrifice, for your heart I'll fight
All for love (Only love)
To your arms I'll run
'cause I know you're mine
Only love (only love)
Can we share one soul
make me whole
Only Love (only love)

I found a home, I'm not alone
I found a home in you
Took me a while but I'm looking up
Because I know you love me too
Because you came right in and you brought me hope
I ain't never, felt this feeling
Wooo, lovin', yeah, yeah

It's crazy
The way you've got the beat of my heart racing
Only love (only love!)
It will build you up
Break you down
Only love (only love)
I will sacrifice, for your heart I'll fight
All for love (Only love)
To your arms I'll run
'cause I know you're mine
Only love (only love)
Can we share one soul
make me whole
Only Love (only love)

Only love, can save the day (I'm telling you)
Only love, got me feeling this way (you know it's true)
Only love, can save the day (I'm telling you)
Only love, got me feeling this way (you know it's true)

Turn my problems all around
Picked me up right of the ground
I'm so glad this love I found
All I need is you right now

It's crazy, so crazy
The way you've got the beat of my heart racing
Only love (only love!)
It will build you up
Break you down
Only love (only love)
I will sacrifice, for your heart I'll fight
(Only love)
To your arms I'll run
'cause I know you're mine
Only love (only love)
Can we share one soul
make me whole
Only Love (only love)

Only love
Only, only, only
Only Love
