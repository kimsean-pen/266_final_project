You talk about life and talk about death and everything in between
Like it's nothing and the words are easy
You talk about me and talk about you and everything I do
Like it's something that needs repeating

I don't need an alibi or for you to realize
The things we left unsaid are only taking space up in our heads
Make it my fault, win the game, point the finger, place the blame
And curse me up and down, it doesn't matter now

'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion, I don't need a reason not to care
What you say or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation and it don't, don't make sense

The first two weeks turn into ten, I hold my breath and wonder
When it'll happen, does it really matter?
If half of what you said is true and half of what I didn't do
Could be different, would it make it better?

If we forget the things we know would we have somewhere to go?
The only way is down, I can see that now

'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion, I don't need a reason not to care
What you say or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation and it don't, don't make sense

It's really not such a sacrifice

If I never talk to you again
This is not about emotion, I don't need a reason not to care
What you say or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation and it don't, don't make sense

And it don't have to make no sense to you at all
'Cause this is my interpretation, yeah, yeah, yeah
