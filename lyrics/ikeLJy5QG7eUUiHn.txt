Are we running so far from facing the numbers who clash in an empty room
for false visions we search and the reflections consume
but the mirror is everyone's tomb
what we'll find in the waste of time all these self hating days in the image maze
Losing sight of our roots in the empty shells
where everyone fights themselves
I'm tired of looking out from blank eyes
i get so tired of waiting outside until its nothing special blank eyes
i get so tired of waiting outside
another answer for our crimes
and i get so tired of waiting for it to find the truh in everything rejected
i get so tired of waiting
another day between the lines
Rooftop to rooftop screaming out into the sky
we fight the war inside us turning answers into questions
through all this vanity we'll fight 'til soul rebuild fools
gold what we had the symptoms of a world gone mad
the world's lies, the masses cry, children's lives spent sewing up our cheap disquise
Losing sight of our roots in the cathode rays
amnesia for the end of our days
All gone dead what we reject wake up everyone
blank eyes
tired of waiting
outside
here i am
blank eyes
tired of waiting and tired of wasting it all away
outside
here i am
