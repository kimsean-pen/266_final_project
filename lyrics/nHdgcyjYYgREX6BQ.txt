Today, I've seen the shallow face I wear
Inside this shell a living hell endures

I'm held captive by my fear
Decaying hope and wasted years
The knife of time carves another line
Around these eyes

Good and evil, lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of
Lies
Lies

Losing faith in who I am
Never changing just rearranging my life again

Through into an eternal abyss I fall
Silent screams through paper, walls
I pray someday the sun will shine on me again
Shine on me again

Good and evil, lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of
Lies
Lies

Lies
Lies
