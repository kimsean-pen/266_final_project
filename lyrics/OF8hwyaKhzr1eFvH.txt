Let me see who you are
Let me see who you are
Don't try to hide the world that you belong
Let me see who you are
Let me see who you are
You're better off where you started from
I know it's where you want to go this time
I see you where you are
Don't fight
You're about to figure out it's fine
It's fine
Let me see who you are
Let me see who you are
Don't try to hide the world that you belong
Let me see who you are
Let me see who you are
You're better off where you started from
I know it's where you want to go this time
I see you where you are
Don't fight
You're about to figure out it's fine
It's fine
