Good dame is
You famous
I knew I'd say this
You, this is all I need
You listening, amazing
Put my strings
Put my reason heartily

You started a fight with me
Anyone go out
Strong as you fit it in
No one will go out

I can see your talk, your talk, your talk
You can see my love, my love, my love

Just say somethin'
Be up from
Hands down on your back
Miraculous

Don't look away
I said don't look away
I can play it safe
Or play it dangerous

You started a flirt in me
Anyone go down
Rushing blood to the head
Yeah it won't run out

I can see your talk, your talk, your talk
You can see my love, my love, my love

Only if you want it
I'm on it, honest
Only if you want it
I'm on it, honest
Only if you want it
I'm on it, honest
Only if you want it
I'm on it, honest

Only if you want it
I'm on it, honest
Only if you want it
I'm on it, honest
Only if you want it
I'm on it, honest
Only if you want it
I'm on it, honest
