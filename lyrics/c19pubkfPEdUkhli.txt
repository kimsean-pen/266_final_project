I lose a bit of myself with every selfie
Lose sleep over wealth it's not healthy
Finding a new religion on Yelp to come help me
Praying to the label itself do not shelf me
In the middle with the beggars and rejects
Reading between text with weed, liquor and sex
She say she love me at dusk
But at dawn I pack up my things and I'm gone

And I don't know where I'm gonna go
But I don't care I'm on the road
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize
Been a lot of places in this life
And I did a lot wrong I can't make right
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize

(Said I will not apologize)

Imperfect, I'm imperfect
No road map getting lost on purpose
Phone no service but It's clear out here
I'm living with nothing to fear out here
There's lessons you learn, bridges you burn
All for the cost of a dollar to earn
And they say they love me at dusk
But at dawn I pack up my things and I'm gone

And I don't know where I'm gonna go
But I don't care I'm on the road
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize
Been a lot of places in this life
And I did a lot wrong I can't make right
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize

(Said I will not apologize)

(And I will not apologize)

I don't know where I'm gonna go
But I don't care I'm on the road
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize
Been a lot of places in this life
And I did a lot wrong I can't make right
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize
Said I will not apologize
(And I will not apologize)
