Conjured from the very thing I despise.
Like a cancer it grows inside.

You always had the goddamn wit.
With just a flick of the wrist,
To pop the button and push her buttons
And send her over the edge.
I'll remember this to the end.
You and your goddamn wit,
Pushed her over the edge.

Contagious in every light,
And I can't stand the sight of myself.
Living this life in skin
I'm not worthy to wear.
As the memories fade,
I can feel myself beginning to change.
Even in my sleep there's no escaping.
Voices plot and plunder,
They're saturating my mind with words of wisdom.
That destroy the world which I once called my kingdom.

With just the flick of the wrist.
You went and pushed her over the edge.
You and your goddamn wit.
I'll remember this to the end.
You and your goddamn wit,
Pushed her over the edge.
