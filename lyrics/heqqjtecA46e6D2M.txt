Knew you'd be a vision in white
How'd you get your pants so tight?
Don't know what you're doin'
But you must be livin' right
Yeah

Oh, we got some places to see
I brought all the maps with me
So jump in, it ain't no sin
Take a ride in my machine

City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go
Go
Go

We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac

Never you mind the exit signs
We got lots of time
We can't quit 'til we get
To the other side
Ah-hah ah-hah

With the radio playin' our song
We keep rollin' along
Who knows how far a car can get
Before you think about your love slowin' down, yeah

City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go
Go
Come on now
Go

We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
Oh yeah

Here we go
(Here we go, here we go, here we go)
One more time
With the wind and
Your fingers in my hair
Kinda think we're going for an extended
Throwdown
So drop the top baby
And let's cruise on into
'It's better than ever' Street

City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go
Go
Come on baby
Go
Do it for me now

We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac

What I want you to do baby
(Freeway of love)
Get over in the left lane
And let's merge for peace, aw yeah
(Freeway of love)
Take the love exit
And then make a right turn
(Freeway of love)
Go on over to Love and Satisfaction
And Joy y'all, well
(Freeway of love)
Oh... ain't we ridin' baby
Ain't we cruisin' down

(Free) Free (Free) Free (Free) Free (Freeway)
Go on out to
Oww... (Free)(Free)(Free) (Free---way)
'Let's be good to each other' Street
Well (freeway of love)
See that little landmark over there?
A whole lotta kisses and sweet stuff
(Freeway of love)
We'll be just about... oh.oh... oh... it's Satisfaction Road, Yeah
(Free)(Free)(Free) (Free---way)
Satisfaction, Yeah
