You leave with the tide and I can't stop you leaving
I can see it in your eyes, some things have lost their meaning

Devote, to me, alone, with me
Say with me: "why would you ever want to leave?"

You leave with the tide and I can't stop you leaving
I can see it in your eyes, some things have lost their meaning

Fade out of view I wouldn't do that to you
I wouldn't just leave us alone when we could be close, close, close

Hold me close when you could leave us alone
Why would you just leave us alone
When we have been close, close

You leave with the tide and I can't stop you leaving
I can see it in your eyes, some things have lost their meaning

You leave with the tide and I can't stop you leaving
I can see it in your eyes, some things have lost their meaning
