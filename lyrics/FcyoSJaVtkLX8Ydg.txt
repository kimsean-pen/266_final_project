I know you know, despite your reservations,
Out of everything in this world, I choose you,
It goes to show, despite our conversations,
Back when you were just a little girl, we had no clue,
Just what we were getting ourselves into,
We were merely trying something new.

Dissolve myself in you,
'Cause I'm not gonna,
Not gonna give you up,
No I'm not gonna,
Not gonna give you up,
Cancel myself to feel you,
'Cause I'm not gonna,
Not gonna give you up,
No I'm not gonna,
Not gonna give you up.

I know you know, despite the implications,
We were out of character, I always knew,
Just what we were getting ourselves into,
We were merely trying something new.

Dissolve myself in you,
'Cause I'm not gonna,
Not gonna give you up,
No I'm not gonna,
Not gonna give you up,
Cancel myself to feel you,
'Cause I'm not gonna,
Not gonna give you up,
No I'm not gonna,
Not gonna give you up.

When we used to lay ourselves out,
On the front lawn of their ivory towers,
We would show our bodies to world,
Then we would go home,
And work on a castle of our own.

You were impatient, I was a fallback,
A dirty mistake, you never called back,
You were salvation, I never told you.

You were impatient, I was a fallback,
A dirty mistake, you never called back,
You were salvation, I never told you,
I always had the notion,
I would fall in love with you,
You were a call girl, I was a gentleman,
A faint illusion of your simple plan,
I was salvation, you never told me,
That you always had the notion,
That you knew what we would be.

I know you know, despite your reservations,
Out of everything in this world, I choose you.
