Open the door
Let a little warmth out
I can see my breath
And my ankles feel like they're going to collapse
From all the stairs that I've been walking up and down
Trying to find you, but I never do

But now it's back to paperwork and fixing the copier
I don't have school tonight
So I think I'll be drinking alone to some Replacements songs
Don't tell a soul
I'd be pleased to meet me too, but I'm all shook down

Under the influence of artists not looking for change
The timing and structure will all resolve and sound the same
