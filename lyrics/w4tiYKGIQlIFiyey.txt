For whatever reason
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand
I'm so glad we're at the same place at the same time
It's over now
I spotted you dancing
You made all the girls stare
Those lips and your brown eyes
And the sexy hair
I shake, shake my thing
I make the world want you
Tell your boys you'll be back
I wanna see what you can do

What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not trying to sound conceited
But me and you were meant to be
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl (don't you know?)
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world

Boys
Sometimes a girl just needs one (you know I need you)
Boys
To love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me)
Boys
And when a girl is with one
Boys
Then she's in control (yeah)

Took the boy off the dance floor
Screaming in his ear
Must have said something 'bout me (what you say?)
Because he's looking over here
You looking at me with a sexy attitude
But the way your boys moving it
It puts me in the mood

What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not trying to sound conceited
But me and you were meant to be (don't you know?)
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl (don't you know?)
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world (I get nasty)

Boys
Sometimes a girl just needs one (I get nasty)
Boys
To love her and to hold (I get nasty)
Boys
And when a girl is with one (I get nasty)
Boys
Then she's in control (you like that? here we go)

Tonight, let's fly, boy have no fear (have no fear)
There's no time to lose (baby, what are you waiting for?)
And next week, you may not see me here
So, boy, just make your move (let me see what you can do)

Boys
Sometimes a girl just needs one
Boys
To love her and to hold (I like that, the way you move)
Boys
And when a girl is with one (it's gonna turn me on)
Boys
Then she's in control (yeah)

Come with me, let's fly into the night
Oh boy, tonight is ours (It's just you and me, baby)
Keep loving me, make sure you hold me tight (hold me too tight)
Let's head for the stars (get nasty, oh)

Boys
Sometimes a girl just needs one
Boys
To love her and to hold (get nasty)
Boys
And when a girl is with one (get nasty)
Boys, I said boys
Then she's in control

Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em
