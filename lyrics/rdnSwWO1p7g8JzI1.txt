Loss on these city streets distant faces distant memories
A city built upon the dead

There are times when those eyes inside your brain stare back at you
Dying should come easy just like a frieght train when your back is turned
I have listened to the sound of water
Running in tubs and longed to drown
Bring me the end that is long overdue
The trouble with a mask is it never changes
Who wants to live forever
I always dream of my death
I concentrate on the bad things

Until there's nobody left

I was born to hustle roses down the avanues of the dead
I suppose like other I have come through fire and sword

Life gone wrong

I have listened to the sound of water running in tubs and longed to drown
Lost at sea head on crashes
We are like a rose that never blooms
It was a lack of hope that discouraged this man
There are times when those eys inside your brain stare back at you
Dying should come easy just like a fright train when your back is turned

Who wants to live forever

I always dream of my death
I concentrate on the bad things
Until there's nobody left
Dreams won't come true

I'm stuck living through these petty days
I can't see straight I can't go on
I concentrate on the bad things

Until there's nobody left

I'm always living the hate life day by day
I can't see straight I can't go on
I concentrate on the bad things
I dream of death until there's nobody left
I can't go on.
