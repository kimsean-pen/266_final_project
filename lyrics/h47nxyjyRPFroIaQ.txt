Even through the darkest phase
Be it thick or thin
Always someone marches brave
Here beneath my skin

And constant (constant) craving craving)
Has always (always) been

Maybe a great magnet pulls
All souls to what's true
Or maybe it is life itself
Feeds wisdom to its youth

Constant (constant) craving (craving)
Has always (always) been
Craving
Ah-ha constant craving
Has always been
Has always been

Constant (constant) craving (craving)
Has always (always) been
Constant (constant) craving (craving)
Has always (always) been

Craving
Ah-ha constant craving
Has always been
Has always been
Has always been (has always)
(Has always) always been
(Has always) always been
Has always been
Has always been
Has always been
