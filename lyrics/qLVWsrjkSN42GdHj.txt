Tell me how to feel, like we did

Tell me how to feel like we did when we were young
You would take the wheel, oh yeah, we were on the run
And I remember nights, we would sing 'til we saw the sun,
Oh, just tell me how to feel like we did when we were young

So young

Yeah, you were dancing to your favourite song,
And all my friends, oh they were singing along
We got down, we got high, and oh the moment felt so right
So let's run free and carry on, like we did when we were young

Turn the music loud and we drive right through the town
Oh, we roll the windows down so the cops won't come around
Take me to the time things were fine, it's all broken now
Well always keep in mind, things are fine and we'll figure it out

Yeah, you were dancing to your favourite song,
And all my friends, oh they were singing along
We got down, we got high, and the moment felt so right
So let's run free and carry on, like we did when we were young

Like we did when we were young

Tell me how to feel like we did when we were young
Oh, just tell me how to feel like we did when we were young,
So young

Yeah, you were dancing to your favourite song,
And all my friends, oh they were singing along
We got down, we got high, oh the moment felt so right
So let's run free and carry on, like we did when we were young

Like we did when we were young, oh so young
Like we did when we were young
