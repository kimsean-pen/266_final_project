The sun is setting on this town
Where rust and ivy intertwine
Where past and present remain bound
In all the things we leave behind
Because spirits linger
Cities whisper
Of who we once were
Repeating over
It echoes all throughout this town
A past more present than it seems
With pained reminders all around
Of what's no longer history
Because spirits linger
Cities whisper
Of who we once were
Repeating over
Spirits linger
Cities whisper
Of who we once were
Repeating over
