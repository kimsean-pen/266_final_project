Well, now, it takes more than a robin to make the winter go
And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow
Well, it takes two hearts a-cookin' to make a fire grow
And baby you've got what it takes

You know it takes a lot of kissin'
To make a romance sweet
Ooh, it takes a lot of lovin' to make my life complete
Mmm, and it takes a lot of woman to knock me off my feet
And baby, you've got what it takes.

I said, mm, mm, mm. uh-huh, mm, mm, mm
Ah, ah, hah mm, mm
You know you've got just what it takes!

Because it takes more than an effort to stay away from you
It'd take more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true
But it takes somebody special to make me say, "I do."

And baby, you've got what it takes.

Ah, ah, hah mm, mm, uh-huh, mm, mm, mm
Mmm
You know you've got just what it takes

Because it takes oh yeah

To stay away from you

It takes more than a lifetime, daddy, to prove that I'll be true

But, it takes somebody special
To make me say, "I do."
And baby you've got what it takes

And baby you've got what it takes

And baby you've got what it takes
