Love's the sweetest feeling
Openly believing
No matter what we find there
Come back in through the eyes there
Sole and born creation
The lion's in the house
Flowers are up in the air
Crashing against the dark

Ah, ahhah ah...

Fire in the water
Is the body of our love
Nobody should see this
The freeness of the light

Ah, ahhah ah...

Fire in the water
Is the body of our love
