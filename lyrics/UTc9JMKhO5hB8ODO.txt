So you think I'm a girl you'd like to meet
Because I look good enough to eat?
I don't mean to stay inside that heart
There's a world that we desire
Seeking out the star that's higher

Johnny, now you're the honey trapped in my tree
You should have known better
Should have known better, messing with love's queen bee
Don't mess with the messer
I ain't sugar, I ain't spice
I'm laying everything all nice
I can be as cold as ice

Well hello, you're Johnny's friend, aren't you?
He sent you to see me
He was a good worker for this queen bee
Anyway, I have something I'll give
If it's a working man's desire
Boy, are you gonna be tired

Johnny, now you're all trapped in my honeycomb
You should have known better
Should have known better, leaving queen bee alone
Don't mess with the messer
I ain't sugar, I ain't spice
I'm laying everything all nice
I can be as cold as ice

Better not mess, better not mess
Better not mess with the messer
Don't mess, don't mess
Don't mess with the messer

Johnny, now you're the honey trapped in my tree
You should have known better
Should have known better, messing with love's queen bee
Don't mess with the messer
I ain't sugar, I ain't spice
I'm laying everything all nice
I can be as cold as ice

Johnny, now you're all trapped in my honeycomb
You should have known better
Should have known better, leaving queen bee alone
Don't mess with the messer
I ain't sugar, I ain't spice
I'm laying everything all nice
I can be as cold as ice

Do you know what I mean?
