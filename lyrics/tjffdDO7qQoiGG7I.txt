It's been a long long ride,
Don't know where I'll sleep tonight.

Oh under the stars
Or maybe in your bed alright.
Against the wind
I crossed your desert today.
Don't care what you say
Cause baby I'm goin'a stay.

Yeah I'll comb this whole beach over
Trying to find the love that'll stay.

It's been a long, long journey
Don't know where I left my mind.

Down in the canyon
Or maybe in the back of your ride.
I'm heading down by the river
To kill your daddy tonight
And by the break of day
You know that we'll be outta sight.

Girl I'll search this whole world over
Trying to find the love that'll stay
