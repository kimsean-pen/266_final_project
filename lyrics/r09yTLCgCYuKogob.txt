To silence all the voices in my head
I'd have to forget every word you said
Been at war with myself from the start
Prayed for light and I was only given dark

Blocking the pain from my chest
But some days are hard to forget
Looking for reasons and failing now

I won't wait
I know my head is such a dangerous place
Get me outta here, I know too much
Won't be long before I've lost your touch
So much hate for things I can't control
My apathy starts to take its toll
I know too much
Won't be long before I've lost your touch

To silence all the voices in my head
I thought it'd go away, it's getting worse instead
Wishing that I knew how
To calm these nerves but they're only staying loud
I fear the worst
I fear that someday I'll have to forget your face
How can I when it's all I see

Blocking the pain from my chest
But some days are hard to forget
Looking for reasons and failing now

I won't wait
I know my head is such a dangerous place
Get me outta here, I know too much
Won't be long before I've lost your touch
So much hate for things I can't control
My apathy starts to take its toll
I know too much
Won't be long before I've lost your touch

Nowhere to turn
What I touch breaks
Lost in all the give and take
Another hit should numb my pain
I fear someday I'll forget your face
Another hit should numb my pain
I fear I'll forget your face

I won't wait
I know my head is such a dangerous place
Get me outta here, I know too much
Won't be long before I've lost your touch
So much hate for things I can't control
My apathy starts to take its toll
I know too much
Won't be long before I've lost your touch
