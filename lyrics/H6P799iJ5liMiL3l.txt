Dark...
thou embrace my bleeding heart
My dreams...
uniting our tearful eyes... enchanting
At night...
I kiss the serpent in thy tears
For years...
thy sorrow I've mourned

Harken my moonchild's cry
Yearning for another night
Mourning my once beloved
Mesmerized and ravendark

Come to me, with your serenity (My pale enchantress of the night)
Nightfall died, in thy tears (At last my candle's burning down)
Burning leaves entranced in morning light (The wintermoon is shining bleak)
Bleeding time, walk a line
For thee my enchantress

Enchanting all my dreams
A beauty and her flood of tears
Nightfall embrace my heart
Mesmerized and ravendark

All my tears have enshrined my moonlit sea (My pale enchantress of the night)
Nightfall's here, but to me
I desire thee!

Fearful I walk with thee...
through dusk...
through winds of loss...
Her beauty and her flood...
embrace...
my bleeding heart...
Tearful I fall with thee...
at last...
lead me there...
To where thy shadow's cast...
they dance...
in velvet darkness lost...

Rise... bleak winter fullmoon!

Rise!

In sleep desire for the light

In life...
I kissed the serpent in thy tears
For years...
thy sorrow I've mourned

Dance in the garden of delight
