Hey brother
Make way for patience
Or there is a chance
To breath through frustration
PIck it up
Fill it up
Not splashing a single drop
There is a lot of peace,
Tranquility
On the calm surface of the heart

Hey sister
Have you been the drama?
It becomes more severe
Every time you fall from grace
A strain of history
Heavy on the shoulders
And the world
It moves forever on

And after the mourning
Morning has gone
It is time again
To journey towards home
The perpetual flame is ever waiting
For the one who sees
All that is done

At last no reason, a sensation,
To slay anymore
The silent hounds are all asleep
And the world it moves forever on
Here
On the calm surface of the heart
