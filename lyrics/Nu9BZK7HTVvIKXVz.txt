Once you get to England and now you have to give up
Yeah, yeah, give up

Welcome to jungle, dear
Where tensions do amount and kids must grow as quick as possible
Welcome to jungle, dear
Risk it on a tooth or bone as you travel along
Come and run run to the roads

Welcome to jungle, dear
Where lorries are chariots, railways are stairways
Stairways to heaven, heaven is brightened
Oh alien, oh alien
Old alien in foreign lands again
You better beat it and go back home
Cause if they find you they will kill you

God save
God save
God save
God save

Welcome to the jungle, dear (welcome to the jungle)
Jungle, dear (welcome to the jungle)
Jungle, dear (welcome to the jungle)
Jungle (welcome to the jungle)
Jungle

(welcome to the jungle)
(welcome to the jungle)
(welcome to the jungle)
(welcome to the jungle)
Jungle, jungle

Hmmmmm
God save the jungle
