Yeah!

Hey, you're giving me a heart attack
You're giving me a cardiac arrest
When I'm sitting at the traffic light

Hey, I wanna get inside of you
I wanna crack your cranium delirium
On the lower east side of your mind

I wanna be your Troublemaker
I wanna be your Troublemaker
I wanna be your Troublemaker
I wanna be your Troublemaker

Hey, I like your BMW
I like your BM-excellent tits
With a tattoo of a pig sniffing glue

Hey, you're living at the W
You're looking like a Jezebel, hot as Hell
Sunburned in a pink bathing suit

I wanna be your Troublemaker
I wanna be your Troublemaker
I wanna be your Troublemaker
I wanna be your Troublemaker

Hey! Yeah!

Easy come and go, gonna go it alone
Knock yourself out with a shot of Patron
I wouldn't say I'm straight 'cause I'm bent out of shape
From now till death do we party just before it's too late

Hey, you're giving me a heart attack
You're giving me a cardiac arrest
When I'm sitting at the traffic light

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
