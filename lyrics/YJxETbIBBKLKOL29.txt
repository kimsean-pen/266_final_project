Well you floated into the room,
As I started to play.
Oh my mind went blank
And my fingers lost their way.
You doubled the stakes that night
On my world
How could I not lose?
Oh did you see the lie in my eyes
Were you gazing through this disguise
I guess you could call this song
My gamble for a rose
I guess you could call this song
My gamble for a rose
Oh soaked in your sunlight
My guitar reflects your face
Or like standing in a rainbow
You paint the landscape side breeze
Well you said I was a dark horse
But would you ride on it with me tonight
Oh and take me disappearing
Through the smoke rings of our minds
And I was alone with my thoughts
I listened to all my savior's savior songs
And I'll wait for you
Oh you know I'll wait for you
When I'm all alone
I guess you could call this song
My gamble for a rose
I guess you could call this song
My gamble for a rose
Oh with your hand in mine
I may be battered
But I will never be broke
With your hand in mine
Oh I will never be broke
...
And I was alone with my thoughts
I listened through all my savior's savior songs
(all my savior's savior songs)
And I'll wait for you
Oh you know I'll wait for you
When I'm all alone
I guess you could call this song
My gamble for a rose
Oh with your hand in mine
I may be battered
But I will never be broke
I guess you could call this song
My gamble for a rose
Oh with your hand in mine
I may be battered
But I will never be broke
I guess you could call this song
My gamble for a rose
