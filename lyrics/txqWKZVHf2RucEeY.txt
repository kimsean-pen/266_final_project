Boy you came like a hurricane
Knocked me down like a tidal wave
Didn't see you comin' so quick
Look at you boy movin' so slick
Always thought love was such a hoax
Throwin' shoes at my radio (Why?)
Silly love songs made me so sick
Couldn't stand them now they all click
And the reason is this this this
I feel like I'm about to fly

Hey boy you got me on my tip toes
Don't stop kiss me and away we'll go
Ooh whoa oh ooah oh
Can't shake it so elevated
Take me any way the wind blows
Don't stop love the way you make me float
Right up off my tip toes

All my friends say I'm freakin' out
They don't know what its all about (So!)
Got my girls up tell 'em all why (Hey girl!)
Call the boys up tell 'em bye-bye (bye bye bye)
I don't know what you did to me
Its like a world with no gravity ('Cause)
Now you got me feelin' so high
Feel like I'm about to fly

Hey boy you got me on my tip toes
Don't stop kiss me and away we'll go
Ooh whoa oh ooah oh
Can't shake it so elevated
Take me any way the wind blows
Don't stop love the way you make me float
Right up off my tip toes

Its a long way down so don't let me fall
You got me feelin' ten feet tall
Every kiss is like the fourth of July
Feel like I'm about to fly

Hey boy you got me on my tip toes
Don't stop kiss me and away we'll go
Ooh whoa oh ooah oh
Can't shake it so elevated
Take me any way the wind blows
Don't stop love the way you make me float
Right up off my tip toes
