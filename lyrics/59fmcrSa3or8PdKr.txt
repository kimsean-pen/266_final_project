Forgett came in my house yesterday
my house that's on decay where roof and tapestry is rotten
where the fire place isn't getting hot and everything is forgotten

Forgett came in my house yesterday
don't know if he wanna stay
he lays him down like a child
in garden that's run pretty wild
and we laugh at each other's smile

I understood in my life
that never anybody else could change one's drive
but you have to prove by your own heart and hand
and though I know that I'm not out of the woods yet
I feel so good

Forgett came in my house yesterday
my house that's not for sale since we had that
sweet tea together since he sits in that leather sofa
since we're together

Forgett came in my house yesterday
my house that's on decay where roof and tapestry is rotten
where the fire place is'nt getting hot and everything is forgotten

Forgett came in my house
Yesterday
