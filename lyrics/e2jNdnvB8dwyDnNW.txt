Day of
Turns
Unread
Love
Callow
And
Light
Out of reach
I had no idea
Everything that tends to happen in between
Stay close while it's easy
You'll stay close to them
Late
It pours
Gently
Out
Lined
Pools
Unrequited
And
Unaired

Desperate to decide
Swayed when it aligns
Stalled it seems enough
Until you get caught up

Desperate and outright
Sway when it aligns

Not what you dreamed of
Not yet
Oh love
Stay and get caught up
