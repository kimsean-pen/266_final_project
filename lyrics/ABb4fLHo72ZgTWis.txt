Are you there?
The wonderful to know
All the ghosts, all the ghosts
Freak my selfish out, mind is happy
Need to learn to let it go
To know you'd do no harm to me
Since you've been gone I've been lost inside
Tried and failed as we walked by the riverside
Oh, I wish you could see the love in her eyes

The best friend that eluded you lost in time
Burned alive in the heat of a grieving mind
Oh, what can I say now?
And it couldn't be wrong 'cause there's no one there

Unmistakably lost and without a care

Oh, lost all the love that, that we could share
And it's wearing me down and it's turning me round
And I can't find a way, now to find it out
Oh, where are you when I need you
Are you there?
Are you there?
Are you there?
Are you there?
