Love, electricity, shock wave central
Power on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on

Lantern burn, burn that easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

Overload, overload, overload
Coming up to the
Overload, overload, overload
Coming up to the

Overload, overload, overload
Coming up to the
Overload, overload, overload
Coming up to the

Oh stylo (juice)
Go forth, blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love

When the mako flies (a giant fish)
Up from the bottom in your eyes
Then I know the twilight skies
Not so broken-hearted (...of the end of the line)

Yes, this love is electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night
Just to get through the week, sometimes it's hard
Right now

Sing yourself (juice) out of depression,
rise above. all recession.
If I know your heart
Electric is the love

There's only one way
(Overload, overload, overload)
Let it pray a little while longer
(Coming up to the overload, overload, overload)

It's got a way of passing
(Coming up to the)
Through man and woman in another world
(Overload, overload, overload)

In another world, in the universe
(Coming up to the overload)
Oh
(Overload, overload, coming up to the)

Right now
Here's what we got to do

Yes, this love is electric
(Overload, overload, overload, coming up to the)
It'll be flowing onto the street
(Overload, overload, overload, coming up to the)

Night after night
(Overload, overload, overload, coming up to the)
Just to get through the week
(Overload, overload, overload)
Sometimes it's hard
(Coming up to the)

That's what I'm talking about

Love, electricity, shock wave central
Pummel on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this all together

The lantern burn, burn that easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out
Right now
