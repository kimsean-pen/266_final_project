Out on the street for a living
You know it's only begun
They've got you under their thumb

Out on the street for a living
And it is only begun
Doing all that you can
And now you're under their thumb

Oooh, black diamond
Oooh, black diamond

Out on the street for a country
And it's only a dream
Got other people marching
And it's only a way

Out on the street for a living
You know it is only begun
Regardless a street or a country
They got you under their thumb
