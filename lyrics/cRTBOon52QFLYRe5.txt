I do take offense,
I won't excuse this point today,
It's such a hurtful thing to say.

Why should I put a gun to my head?
Why not kill everyone else instead?!

When I was a child,
Like a doll I used to break.
Fragile and deeply ashamed,
I only ever blamed myself.

But now I can clearly see,
The problem never even lay with me.

Why should I put a bullet in my beautiful head?
Why not get rid of the vermin
And kill everyone else instead?!

Oh, if I had the power,
I would create the quiet earth.
I would erase all human life
From this and every other universe.

On any given day,
I'd push that button most happily...

...'cause I'm a homosexual.
