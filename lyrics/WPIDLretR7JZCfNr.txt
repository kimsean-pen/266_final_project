I remember 15 years old at the edge of my bed
As Joy Division's "Closer" spins
I slowly drift off in my head
I swear I died a thousand times
To the ballad of those teenage nights
The walls cave in
And I've lost myself again

Don't sink cause I know it's tough
Said you saw it comin' weren't prepared enough
You wanna doubt you deserve to be loved
But keep your head up I swear that you belong

Isolation
It gets the best of me
The world progresses
While I'm chasing dreams

I question everything
Before I dive right in
Am I a recluse
Or just a damaged kid

And even at 25, I find myself in silence
My shaking voice is screaming out
But I still prefer the quiet
All my friends moved on
Or gave up on themselves
I can't commit to anything
Except the words escaping my mouth
(Except the words escaping my mouth)

Isolation
It gets the best of me
The world progresses
While I'm chasing dreams

I question everything
Before I dive right in
Am I a recluse
Or just a damaged kid

We're all just damaged kids

Don't sink cause I know it's tough
Said you saw it comin weren't prepared enough
You wanna doubt that you deserve to be loved
But keep your head up I swear that you belong

Isolation
It gets the best of me
The world progresses
But I'm stuck in these dreams

I question everything
Before I dive right in
Am I a recluse
Or just a damaged kid

We're all just damaged
