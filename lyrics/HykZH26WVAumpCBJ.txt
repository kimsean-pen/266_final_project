Oh, stop thinking of tomorrow, don't stop thinking of today
You're not getting any younger, you've got nothing to explain

You've got resolutions, you've got resolutions
Fastening in your wake, fastening in your wake
Take instead the high tide, take instead the high tide
At the man-made lake, at the man-made lake

It may take a while, it may take a while
It may take all day, it may take all day
All the implications, all the implications
At the man-made lake, at the man-made lake

Oh, stop thinking of tomorrow, don't stop thinking of today
You're not getting any younger, you've got nothing to explain
