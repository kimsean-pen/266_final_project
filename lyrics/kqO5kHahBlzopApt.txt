My house is black
Filled with watered roses
In darkness I reside
Where thoughts can't cope to mark their growth

Neither time can frame
The phenomenon of purpose
Neither I can frame
The blessings, nor the burdens

Time let us be
Let our thorns have their way
The brighter the light becomes
I hope it will unveil

It was all worth my pain...
