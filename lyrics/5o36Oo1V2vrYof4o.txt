Are we ever gonna
You should make up your mind
Take you back to my shrine
And I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
They don't know how you like it
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
And I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more

Yeah, I got the feelin' you've been here before
You needed tonight like a weekend ago
Yeah, you in or you out or you playin' or foldin'
We in need of a moment
Are we ever gonna
You should make up your mind
Take you back to my shrine
Don't you pay them no mind
Let them be, let them go
She was made for my eyes
We escape at times
And I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
They don't know how you like it
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
I'ma need the whole night
And little bit more
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
They don't know how you like it
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more
Yeah, the party gets shallow the deeper we go
Telling you secrets that you shouldn't know
Yeah, I feel like it's just you and me on the floor
We in need of a moment
Are we ever gonna
You should make up your mind
Take you back to my shrine
Don't you pay them no mind
Let them be, let them go
She was made for my eyes
We escape at times
And I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
They don't know how you like it
(I'm gonna need a whole night)
I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more
