There ain't no way, to explain or say
How painful the hangover was today
In front of the toilet, hands and knees
Tryin' to breathe in-between the dry-heaves

My baby made me some coffee
Afraid that if I drink some
It's probably comin' right back out me
Couple of Advil, relax and chill

At a standstill with how bad I feel
I think I need to smell fresh air
So I stepped out the back door and fell down the stairs
The sunlight hit me dead in the eye like

It's mad that I gave half the day to last night
My bad sight made me trip on my ass right
Into that patch of grass like "That's life"
All of a sudden, I realized somethin'
The weather is amazin', even the birds are bumpin'

Stood up and took a look and a breath
And there's that bike that I forgot that I possessed
Never really seen exercise as friendly
But I think something's tellin' me to ride that 10 speed

The brakes are broken, that's alright
The tires got air and the chain seems tight, huh
Hopped on, and felt the summertime
It reminds me of one of them Musab lines
Like

Sunshine sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warmin' up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in, to win
I love the days when it shines
Whoa, let it shine

Sunshine sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warmin' up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in, to win
I love the days when it shines
Whoa, let it shine
Whoa, let it shine
Whoa, let it shine
Whoa, let it shine
Whoa let it

If I could I would keep this feelin' in a plastic jar
Bust it out whenever someone's actin' hard
Settle down, barbecue in the backyard
The kids get treats and old folks get classic cars

Everyday that gets to pass is a success
And every woman looks better in a sundress
The sunshine's an excuse to shoot hoops, get juice
Show improve them moves and let loose

I hear voices, I see smiles to match 'em
Good times, and you can feel it in the fashion
Even though the heat cooks up the action
The street's still got butterflies, enough kids to catch 'em

Ridin' my bike around these lakes, man
Feelin' like I finally figured out my escape plan
Take it all in the day, started off all wrong
But somehow now that hangover is all gone

Ain't nothin' like the sound of the leaves
When the breeze penetrates these Southside trees
Leanin' up against one, watchin' the vibe
Forgettin' all about the stress, thankin' God I'm alive

It's so simple, I had to keep the song simple
And when I get home, I'm gonna open all the windows
Feelin' alright, stopped at a stop-sign
A car pulled up, bumpin' Fresh Prince at Summertime

Summer summer, time
I feel it in my skin, warmin' up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in, to win
I love the days when it shines
Whoa, let it shine

Sunshine, sunshine it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warmin' up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in, to win
I love the days when it shines
Whoa, let it shine
Whoa, let it shine
Whoa, let it shine
Whoa, let it shine
Whoa let it
