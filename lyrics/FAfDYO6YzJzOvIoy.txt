I've been feelin' like everything's for nothing
In fact, I've never felt so god damn smal
Always searchin' for the bright sides, to find the strength for when I fall
I'm still believing that life has a meaning
Can't cope with thinkin' that there's not
I'm so divided that I try to hide it
It's the only real thing that I've got

So when the world outside can't see what's wrong and right
People can't understand the reasons that we fight
Something's gotta give
Violence give me violence
'Cause they say we're the worthless ones!
Substance give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down
Violence give me violence
'Cause they say we're the worthless ones!
Substance give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

You can call this a warning
It's a warning that were drowning in our malcontent
Year me down like a cancer, that's your answer?
We're different and it makes you sick
There is sadness here, on every corner, it's in our hearts, dear God!
Don't wanna trouble you much
But we all need to know when enough is enough!

So when the world outside can't see whats wrong and right
People can't understand the reasons that we fight
(Reasons that we fight)
Something's gotta give
Violence give me violence
'Cause they say we're the worthless ones!
Substance give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down
Violence give me violence
'Cause they say we're the worthless ones!
Substance give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down.

You only get one chance, and that's one too much
What's the world gonna say when I call your bluff, punk?
Bow your head!

Violence give me violence
'Cause they say we're the worthless ones!
Substance give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down
Violence give me violence
'Cause they say we're the worthless ones!
Substance give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down
