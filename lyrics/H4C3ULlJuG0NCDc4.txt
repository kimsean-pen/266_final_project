I know I can't come near you
Every time I do
I get shaking inside and the sun in my eyes
So I'll stay away

I'd rather be here
Than anywhere with you

I've been dancing with your ghost
Toasting note to note
So here's to the passing of all that could be
Between you and me

I'd rather be here
Than anywhere with you

I know I cannot see you
Even if I wanted to
Because your light is the light of ten sunsets
Circled by eyes burned blue and open wide

I'd rather be here
Than anywhere with you

I'd rather be here
Than anywhere with you
