I'm out of my place I'm out of my mind
I'm totally bent in the big time
There's no place for one of my kind
Scorn behind shades I don't care anyway

Celestial the Queen
Celestial the Queen
Celestial the Queen

Her world turns around
In my ears the sound of laughter
Swift descent
Dark and mute dreams deceive

Her world turns around me
Celestial the Queen
Celestial the Queen

She came from the dark she came from a dream
All leather and chain the rising Queen
Born into the night born into the spotlight
She spread her wings and then she was gone

Celestial the Queen
Celestial the Queen
Celestial the Queen

The world turns around
In my head the fairy laughter
Swift ascent and then forever
It meant nothing

The world turns around me
Celestial the Queen
Celestial the Queen
