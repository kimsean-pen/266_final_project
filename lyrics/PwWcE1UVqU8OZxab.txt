I feel your tongue tired, drill into my teeth
Doomsday depressed, directionless and weak
I only feel alive if I'm fucked up or asleep
To make this my life isn't cheap
At least it's easy
Say that every week, at least it's easy
Why don't you touch my hand?
Curb your temper it's the weekend
Figured I don't need it
Til the pendulum swing, leave me reelin'
Shaken up headache, tuesday afternoon
Acting like a drain pipe exploded in your room
I was dripping with aggression, I didn't know what to do
Serendipitous and trite
I go through this every night
Why don't you touch my hand?
Curb your temper it's the weekend
Figured I don't need it
Til the pendulum swing, leave me reelin'
