You know you're talking to the wrong man, my friend
I was on the fence
Wasting time in future tense
And all I came here for was finding love
To help me understand my own

It's undefendable
And now you wanna tell me you're devoted
All the while you told me you don't know
And now you wanna come and sell me what I already own

And now you're trying to teach me what I already know
You know you're talking to the wrong man, my friend
When they bleed you out
I won't blame you now
And all I came here for was finding love to help me understand my own

Right wrong way to go
And all the greatest hands that I would hold in mine
All the times I had to let them go
And now they wanna come and sell you what you already own

And now they're trying to teach you what you already know
You know you're talking to the wrong man, my friend
I'll still make amends
Gaining time in present tense
And all I came here for was finding love to help me understand my home

And redefine it all
So the air I'll breathe in to drown in the sea
I've been beat up and did you know
You said you'd know
I get a little bit chewed up
I wouldn't if I had known
And seeing some other you hopeful
I know and I know you don't see
I'm being easy falling down the breeze
I know you won't count on me
And the truth never bothers me
I know and I know you don't
You're celebrated for your time away

I know you won't be sleeping
You know you're talking to the wrong man, my friend
When they bleed you out
I won't blame you now
And all I came here for was finding love
To help me understand my own
Right wrong way to go
