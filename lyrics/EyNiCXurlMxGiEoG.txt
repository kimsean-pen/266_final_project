I'm not a mistake
Hurts when you talk that way
That way

And I'm not a waste
Time it takes to fuck this up
The distaste distrust

I'll miss you
I'll miss you

But I'm not in love
I don't think I can be
Thought that I could be with you

I'm not in love
No I can't be
Thought I could be with you, you
With you, with you, with you

And it's not a shame
You act this way
It just shows
It's me you love

But I'm not afraid
To walk away, because I know
I'm built to live alone

And I'll miss you
And I'll miss you

I'm not in love
No I can't be
Thought that I could be with you

I'm not in love
No I can't be
Thought I could be with you
With you, with you, with you, with you
