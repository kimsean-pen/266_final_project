Even the rats know when troubles gonna come
To the edge of the city see the little guys run
I hear spring is nice in Canada

Maybe the men up on capitol hill
Need a little less Jack and a little more Jill
You can have my stereo

Even though the race may never be won
I can lay like a dandy gettin' heavy in the sun
Take a love song and beautify

(Waoh waoh waoh)

I hear the words but the meaning gets lost
It's a game, it depends on who the ball gets tossed
It's the same ball anyway

You're tuggin' me know cut me loose or take me on
You can play, you can pay the piper all night long
That's some good home cookin'

Even though the race may never be won
I can lay like a dandy gettin' heavy in the sun
Take a love song and beautify

(Waoh waoh waoh)

**alternate line in second verse:

If you can hear me now
Then you're halfway there
Just a jump from your window
Fly naked through the air
Take a long hard look
