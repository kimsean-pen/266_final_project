My love, we have seen it all
The endless confession, The rise and fall
As fragile as a child
But lately I'm sorry I can't hold a smile

But I stand tall to get by
No matter how hard I try to hide
How did you know I'd take the time for you
How did you know that I would see you through
How did you know that I would play the part
I must've made it clear right from the start

My love, can you give me strength
Somehow I forgot how to ease my pain
I know I'm right where I belong
Something from nothing never proved me wrong

But I stand tall to get by
No matter how hard I try to hide
How did you know I'd take the time for you
How did you know that I would see you through
How did you know that I would play the part
I must've made it clear right from the start

I would share my whole life with you
Would you do the same for me
I would give all I am to you
Would you do the same for me

And I will stand tall to get by
No matter how hard I try to hide
Could you see I could break
Did you notice all my mistakes
There were times I could feel you read my mind
How did you know I'd take the time for you
How did you know that I would see that through
How did you know that I would play the part
I know I made it clear right from the start
