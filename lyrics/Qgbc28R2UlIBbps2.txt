Uncontrolled riot
In my soul that is
Devastating fire
Please burn the way through this

All systems collapse in my inner sanctum
While I'm still alive
Then why postpone the thing that I hope for
The craving for an instant death
I'm crawling out of the filth that I live in
Only to see the sun
Sink below a dead horizon
This one and only time

Deep down the waters
A man who's made of guilt
Is floating out in the silence
The dead's laughter has built
And wherever I came from
I can't remember now
'Cause deep down the waters
I'm floating out to drown
