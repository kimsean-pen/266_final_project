Baby, I've been feeling a bit on edge
Lately, I've been careless at making bets.
Living in a world where it's always Monday,
One AM and dark, and it's always pouring
Where you can feel the weight of a new day rising
By the neon furies of advertising.

But baby, we're not here to stay,

So hey, hey, hey, hush, don't be crying now, hear,
Cos any day fortune may wander down, dear,
And we can see a world that is milk and honey,
The tapestry of life as a beautiful journey.
There's always a promise of a silver lining,
There's that elation of perfect timing...
In a perfect world...

Baby, I can see through their idle threats
So easy I can walk through their bayonets.
But even still I can stumble and fall,
And every step I miss, it still takes its toll
Even if I wise up there's always a price,
Serenity betrays and troubles arise,

But baby, they're not here to stay,

So hey, hey hey, hush, don't be crying now, hear...

... In a perfect world we'd know just why

In a perfect world we would never lie
In a perfect world there'd be no reason to cry
In a perfect world, In a perfect world
In a perfect world we'd never die

So hey, hey hey, hush, don't be crying now, hear...
