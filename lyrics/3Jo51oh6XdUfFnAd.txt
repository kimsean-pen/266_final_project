This is the way nightmares begin
How stupid are the people of the country?
Err I don't know what I said
Argh I don't remember
I don't remember
I don't remember
Err maybe that's what I said
How stupid
We should go for waterboarding
And we should go tougher
Chop off heads
Get these terrorists
Get these terrorists
This is the twilight zone

I remember waking up on November 9, 2016
And feeling a little bit nauseous
It felt like descending into a bottomless pit on a high speed rail
Careening head first into the unknown

Twilight zone
We will make American great again

Disgusted and depressed
We know the world is just a mess
Distortion of reality
The truth is under arrest

This is the twilight zone
The world went on much as it had been going on
Crisis
Twilight zone

We will make American great again

Confusion and consent
Has always been their intent
Destruction of society
Unless we dissent

This is the twilight zone
The world went on much as it had been going on
Crisis
We're in the twilight zone
Twilight zone

But there's no better word than stupid
Firing up the crazies
How stupid
This is the twilight zone

Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
