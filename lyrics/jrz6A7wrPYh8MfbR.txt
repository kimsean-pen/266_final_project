I wish i knew how it would feel to be free
I wish i could break all the chains holding me
I wish i could say all the things that i should say
say 'em loud say 'em clear
for the whole wide world to hear
I wish i could share
all the love thats in my heart
Remove all the bars that keep us apart
And i wish you could know how it feels to be me
Then you'd see and agree that every man should be free
I wish i could be like a bird in the sky
How sweet it would be if i found i could fly
Well i'd soar to the sun and look down at the sea
and i sing cos i know how it feels to be free
I wish i knew how it would feel to be free
I wish i could break all the chains holding me
And i wish i could say all the things that i wanna say
Say 'em loud say 'em clear
For the whole wide world to hear
Say 'em loud say 'em clear
For the whole wide world to hear
Say 'em loud say 'em clear
For the whole wide world to hear
One love one blood
One life you've got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sister, brother
One life but we're not the same
We got to carry each other
carry each other
whoah whoah whoah whoah whoah ...
I wish i knew how it would feel to be free
I wish i knew how it would feel to be free
