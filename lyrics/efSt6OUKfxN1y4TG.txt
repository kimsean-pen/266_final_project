I was never the kind to run from emotions.
I'm not embarrased by a kiss that might go astray.
I like intension to be out in the open.

when I realize that I could be that bold.
You think I'm a little wild but you don't have a clue.

I BLUSH .
Do you dream of a girl who likes to be in control.
Do you secretly want to go where it takes you.

My mind's going places that I can't believe.
I BLUSH.
When I think about what I wanna do to you.
I BLUSH.
When I realize that I could be that bold.
you think
I BLUSH
