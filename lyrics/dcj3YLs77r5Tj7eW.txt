I'm calling under and over, around
Strange combinations are keeping us down.
You've got a feeling you'll never get found
Strange combinations, it's square and it's round.

Ooh

I'm checking I'm checking my distance and keeping it tight.
My understanding is that you'll be mine,
'Cause deep under water you're caught up in line.
Checking my distance and keeping it tight.

Ooh

I'm cheking It's strange I now call you friend.
You were a stranger I can't pretend.
You were my sister, I can't explain.
And it's strange the way it ends.

I'm calling under and over, around
Strange combinations are keeping us down.
You've got a feeling you'll never get found
Strange combinations, it's square and it's round.

Ooh

So strange I now call you friend.
Perfect strangers in the end.
You were my sister I can't explain
And it's strange the way it ends.
