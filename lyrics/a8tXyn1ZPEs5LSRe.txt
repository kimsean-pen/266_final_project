I've been counting all my steps, all my no's just turned to yes.
Silently I must confess, my troubled history.
That's washed away all my sins, starting over once again
This is where it all begins, It's right in front of me
Down is not where I belong, this aching heart won't turn to stone
There's a fire inside these bones, It was meant to be
I see the world still full of light, how could I ever be so blind
I still haven't lost my fight, that haunts me in my sleep
I feel like waking up, I've had this dream before
I'll take these footsteps, go higher, go higher
I've walked an empty mile, wore down this lonely soul
I'll take these footsteps, go higher, go higher
Go higher, go higher
Higher, higher
I know only time will tell, If all the card will treat me well
Cause this hand that I been dealt, keeps me wondering
So now here I turn the page, I've learned to silence all my rage
Tell me who can really say, what will tomorrow bring
I feel like waking up, I've had this dream before
I'll take these footsteps go higher, go higher
I've walked an empty mile, wore down this lonely soul
I'll take these footsteps, go higher, go higher
Go higher, go higher
Higher, Higher
I'll find you, so far away
I'll find you, after all
I'll find you, so far away
I'll find you, after all
I feel like waking up, I've had this dream before
I'll take these footsteps, go higher, go higher
I've walked an empty mine, wore down this lonely soul
I'll take these footsteps go higher, go higher
I feel like waking up, I've had this dream before
I'll take these footsteps go higher, go higher
I've walked an empty mine, wore down this lonely soul
I'll take these footsteps, go higher, go higher
I feel like waking up, I've had this dream before
I'll take these footsteps go
Higher, higher
