The road is endless and paved in misery
Tears fall and turn to glass
Yet we must walk on
Step after merciless step we're shredded to the bone
We bleed
We grow callus
Our great reward is waiting
Shining bright in the distance
We must walk on
Passed empty houses, we must walk on
To the broken right hand of god
We must walk on
We leave or are left behind
We must walk on
We must walk on
We must
We will fail
