Rejoice, for tonight it is a world that we bury!
Have you beheld the darkness sitting upon the earth
Overshadowing the wind rose, lost in the smoke?
Thus many went astray at once
The others wandered hazardously though endless mazes
The rays of the sun whisper of a newborn fright
And very few horrors in the world could match in terror
The cruelty of that frozen caress and its fragrant secret in blossom

Thy bend their tongues with a long drawn sigh
Licking among the vilest ordure a few drops of hopeful water
They bend their tongues for this divine balm
Remains of an aborted covenant gone astray in desert waste

The bleak sterility of these buds belies their fragrance
A pestilence that permeates the vastest plains with frightful odors
Among these foetid marshes wanes the echo of a promise
Hope stumbles amidst the solitary shades and lose substance
Facing the glowing darkness whilst ravens croak for doom
The other worlds on high sent us a harbinger
Ignis ardéns – He breathed on them
And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.

Assailli par les myriades fourmillantes des phosphenes célestes
On se recueillait dans le silence de son depart
