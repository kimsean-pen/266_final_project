A terrible thought has moved into my mind
Like an unwanted room-mate drunk on wine
It feeds on my unhappiness, won't pay the rent
I must take proper measures to evict it

A terrible thought has moved into my mind
A giant rat that's nibbling on my pride
It's tearing away my patience and my wits
I must take proper measures to set a trap for it

What a terrible thought

I don't care what you've done
I don't care who you've won
I know in the end, you have your fun

But you can't have it here
And I won't let you steer
You know I don't want you in my mind
What a terrible thought
What a terrible, terrible thought

I must stay calm you know and I must be clear
It's gonna take a hundred thoughts to make this one disappear
A train like that can travel a soul for years
A terrible thought can have a terribly long career

What minds have you shredded
I bet they regretted
Having ever thought you up

Just look at you shine
Committing your crimes
You know I don't want you in my mind

'Cause you're breaking my stride
You poisonous vine
You're strangling me inside
You're breaking my stride
You poisonous vine
You're strangling me inside
You're breaking my stride
What a terrible thought...

(Father: What is your greatest worry because you seem to be worried all the time.)
(Daughter: Sometimes I can't hear myself think.)
(Father: You have to speak a little louder, I can't understand a word you're saying.)
