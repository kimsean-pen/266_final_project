If love could be the answer
then the answer would be you
if I could have a feeling
then I want it to be true

[...]
but the feeling's gone,
feeling has gone.

I walk until I've reason(?)
but I've got no reason to
trying, try, forever (?)
but i would get back to you.

I'm dying to reach you
I'm dying to see you
I'm dying to hold you and
I'm dying to have you

I could try to make you stay
but the feeling's gone
the feeling has gone

They're all built on strength
and I'll build it up too
cut away the answer and
I know I'll get to you

I'm dying to reach you
I'm dying to see you
I'm dying to hold you
and I'm dying to have you

some things never go away
but the feeling's gone
the feeling is gone.
