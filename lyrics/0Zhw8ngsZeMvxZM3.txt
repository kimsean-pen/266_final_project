I see nothing out the window, window
Nothing out the window
Watching all the leaves grow, leaves grow
Feels better in my dreams though, dreams though

And the sun will shine, no more
The sun will shine (antidote), no more
I've been holding on, too long
Holding on too

I know when the wind blows, wind blows
Feels better in my dreams though, dreams though
I just wanna sleep forever
Please just let me leave, forever

I don't need an antidote, antidote
I don't need an antidote, antidote
I don't need an antidote, forever
(Forever, forever)

We don't wanna drive slow, drive slow
Speed up with our eyes closed, eyes closed

Eyes closed, eyes closed
Head down, eyes closed
Ice cold, melt down
