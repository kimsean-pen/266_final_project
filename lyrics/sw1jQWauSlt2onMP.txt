Oh, my gosh, I did it again

I don't even know how I did that
Need a round of applause
Just like cream to a kitty cat
Lining up at the door
Maybe it's the way I work it
My beach bring the boys to the shore
Maybe it's the way I flirt
That they get hurt, they just don't learn

I don't even know
Why they fall like dominoes

Oh, my gosh, I did it again
He said I broke his heart, it keeps happening
I don't know why they always fall for me
Why they always fall fo-
Oh, my gosh, I did it again
He said I broke his heart, it keeps happening
I don't know why they always fall for me
Why they always fall fo-

Oh, na, na, oh, na, na
Oh, na, na, oh
Oh, na, na, oh, na, na
Oh, na, na, oh

Them boys getting too ambitious
They should win an award
Got twenty more, plenty more fishes
But I still come first
Maybe I'm superstitious
I wanna break this curse
They say they wanna lay it on me
I'm their one and only girl

I don't even know
Why they fall like dominoes

Oh, my gosh, I did it again
He said I broke his heart, it keeps happening
I don't know why they always fall for me
Why they always fall fo-
Oh, my gosh, I did it again (oh, my gosh)
He said I broke his heart, it keeps happening
I don't know why they always fall for me
Why they always fall fo-

Oh, na, na, oh, na, na
Oh, na, na, oh
Oh, na, na, oh, na, na
Oh, na, na, oh

Oh, my gosh, I think I did it again (did it again)
Broke his heart, why does this keep happening? (keep happening)
Don't come crying when I say it's the end (say it's the end)
I'm ringing the alarm, boy, you better run on, oh

Oh, my gosh, I did it again (my gosh, I think I did it again)
He said I broke his heart, it keeps happening (it just keeps happening)
I don't know (don't come crying when I say it's the end)
Why they always fall for me? (I don't know why they always fall for me)
Why they always fall fo- (always fall for me)

Oh, my gosh
Oh, my, oh, my, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my, oh, my gosh
Oh, my, oh, my, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my, oh, my gosh
