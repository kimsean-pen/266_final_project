Im gonna bleed in the club
I got weed in my lungs
I don't need any love
I cant feel when Im drunk
I cant breathe, I cant trust
I cannot get enough
Watch my dreams being crushed
Turn my dreams into dust

Cold outside and I don't know what to wear
If you go right now I don't know if I would care
I don't get scared but I get nightmares
Whats the point of anything if you cant share
I love cold winds cause it tells me where to go
I cant look back and I cannot lose control
Find yourself, find yourself

Im gonna bleed in the club
I got weed in my lungs
I don't need any love
I cant feel when Im drunk
I cant breathe, I cant trust
I cannot get enough
Watch my dreams being crushed
Turn my dreams into dust

Lost my speed now Im slowing down
I cant believe that Im lonely now
100 keys and they owe me now
I cannot feel anything inside
I couldn't breathe when you told me why
I want to sleep I don't want to die
Admit defeat, give away the crown
If we don't speak you cant let me down
