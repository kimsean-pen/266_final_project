Fast money music, fast money music
It's dearly seen, it's dearly seen
Slap you on the hand, you take it on the run
You look the other way, you look the other way
Fast money music, fast money music
Woah, ooh
Fast money music, fast money music
You get fame, and then you get money
It's a fast money big time, it's a fast money big time
Fast money music, fast money music
Wooh, ooh, shh
Fast money music, fast money music
It's all you wanna hear, you don't really care
It's a fast money [...], it's a fast money [...]
Fast money music, fast money music
Woah, ooh, ssss
Fast money music, fast money music
It's nearly seen, it's nearly seen
Slap you on the hand, you take it on the run
You look the other way, you look the other way
Fast money music, fast money music
Woah, ooh, shh
