She self-medicates
She cries and make her lies seem more sincere when she's outta line
She's always right, got her own best interest in mind
She's a bad girl, always outta line
She's kind at times
She's the first to pick a fight and convinced that she's always right

She's up and down, and in and out of this world
She's always outta line, always outta line
She drives me crazy, all of the time
Bipolar baby
One of a kind
She'll break your heart

Like she broke mine
Bipolar baby
Make up your mind
make up your mind

She's a waste of time(of time)
She'll leave you high and dry
She curses and kisses
And talks while she listens
She's a bad girl

Always outta line
She's a bad girl
Always outta line
Always outta line

She drives me crazy, all of the time
Bipolar baby
One of a kind
She'll break your heart
Like she broke mine

Bipolar baby
Make up your mind
Make up your mind
Time's slippin away gotta pick up the pace

like she's running always and I'm left behind
Is she worth the chase, should I let her go
if she comes in close will she hear me say slow down
She drives me crazy all of the time

Bipolar baby
One of a kind
She'll break your heart
Like she broke mine
Bipolar baby
Make up your mind
She'll drive me crazy all of the time
Bipolar baby
One of a kind
She'll break your heart
Like she broke mine
Bipolar baby
Make up your mind
Make up your mind
