A little ray of comfort - in the afternoon
To brighten up the room
To lighten up your mood
The whole world is an ink spot on a plastic spoon
You can fight it
Or invite it
Live beside it, laughing 'til you're crying

Hold on to your time boy
Don't be scared of what they'll say
You'll pull it off fine girl
If you got the face for today... yeh!

Oh yeh, oh yeah! mmmm

Around around the wall of death around you go
What keeps you in the air
Is having not a care
Yeh
And time flies like a dancing man on crystal glow
You can fight it

Or invite it
Live beside it, laughing 'til you're crying

Hold on to your time boy
Don't be scared of what they'll say
You'll pull it off fine girl
You've got that thing which makes us smile, yeh!
Hold on to your time boy

Make up your own fat cach√©
You'll pull it off fine girl
If you got the face for today... yeh!
Yeh
When you got the face for today... yeh!
Hold on to your time boy
Don't be scared of what they'll say
You'll pull it off fine girl
You've got that thing which makes us smile, yeh!
Hold on to your time boy
Wake up on that speeding train
You'll pull it off fine girl
If you got the face for today... yeh!
The face for today... yeh!
The face for today... yeh!
