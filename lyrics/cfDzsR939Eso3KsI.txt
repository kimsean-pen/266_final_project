Enthralled by the thirst, thoughts of a deviant man
Intoxified, thoughts of taking life
No live are mourned, no cares, nothing more
Two worlds collide with innocence and hatred

Fourteen days and fourteen lives
Random victims are my prey
13 dead unlucky strike
So many more...

Under the pain, I hear the distant cries
Suffocation of my thoughts, haunted by the 14 lives
The dead are always taunting me, my killing spree will show
Your life will now depend on the number that you pull

Fourteen days and fourteen lives
Random victims are my prey
12 still live, so 12 must die
I'm on a roll

Fourteen days and fourteen lives
Random victims are my prey
11 gone, 10 crucified
Who's next to go

9 bodies found today, 8 was yesterday
And as we down the count, 7 was there for me
I look for 6 today and 5 tomorrow pays
And no one ever seems to get away

From my pain, my number game
From my insane, number game
The blood will rain in my number game
The numbers lost, the number game
The numbers lost

Fourteen days and fourteen lives
Random victims are my prey
The number 4 was an easy score
Number 3 lived next door

Fourteen days and fourteen lives
Random victims are my prey
Number 2 was next in line
I'm on a roll

Fourteen days and fourteen lives
Random victims are my prey
Down to one there is no more
In 14 days are 14 dead
