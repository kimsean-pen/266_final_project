You may have plans
But I can't tell you all was right!
And you can beg apologies to me!

I will pick her up
She can hold on me
I will pick her up

She can hold on me
You got it?
Every morning

I can't stand my memories
Every morning of this utopy!
Every morning

I can't stand my memories
Every morning of this utopy!
Is this all real?

I told you it's all a treason!
And you can beg apologies to me!
I will pick her up
She can hold on me
You got it?
I will pick her up
She can hold on me
You got it?
Every morning
I can't stand my memories
Every morning of this utopy!
It's not about you!
Missing out is how I wanna get it!
In a gasp of time
Where are you?
Missing out it's how I wanna get it
In a gasp of time
Where are you?
Every morning
I can't stand my memories
Every morning of this utopy!
It's not about you!
Missing out is how I wanna get it!
In a gasp of time
Where are you?
Missing out is how I wanna get it!
