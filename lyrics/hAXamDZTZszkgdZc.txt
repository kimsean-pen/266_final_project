She fell asleep during Coachella and she woke up here
It's not hell
There's way too many angels in the atmosphere
Hey, you
A voice said "I am Hendrix, let me know your name"
Yeah, you
Come look into the music and you won't feel pain

How did we, how did we, how did we get here
She can't remember
How did we, how did we, how did we get here

Then she remembers

Oh, yeah, they
They all dropped acid cause the time was right
Yeah, there was way too much magic in the air to fight
They swear the grass began singing to them

Oh, yeah, they
They all dropped acid cause the time was right

Woodstock
W-w-w-w-Woodstock
W-w-w-w-Woodstock
W-w-w-w-Woodstock
