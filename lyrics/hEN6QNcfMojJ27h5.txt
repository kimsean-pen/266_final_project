Mind you mind me
You thought you could climb me
I'm sorry to cut your rope
But in you I've lost all hope
Mind you mind me
I haven't seen you lately
Oh how many times you used to phone
To see if your seed I could sow

I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without

I tell you if that's what your about
Friends like you I can do without
Mind you mind me
I laugh at your transparency
You're my new best friend
Your fucked up life can I mend
Mind you mind me
How things can change in a good week

Call me ruthless
But you stretch the truth, oh yes

I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
I tell you if that's what you're about

Friends like you I can do without
Believe me, I know you work
Insidiously
Believe me, I know you work
Insidiously
Believe me, I know you work
Insidiously
Believe me, I know you work
Insidiously
Mind you mind me, you smile so sweetly
I'd call you an acquaintance
stop with your exaggerations
Mind you mind me I find it interesting to see
When I only offer you a smile
Oh how you forget to dial
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
