Baby, I finally know what I'm going after
I'm learning to let in all the laughter
Holy moly, you're so funny
You crack me up, you crack me up

Look out for dreams that keep returning
'Cause magic [Incomprehensible] yearning
You feel it, you want it
The way I want you, babe

Traveling by choo-choo train
We know where
We just don't know when
Like some everlasting [Incomprehensible] love

Never heard a better bad joke said out loud
You flip, flap and I wild out
Can you believe it?
I can't believe it but it's true

You're giving eighty billion years of giggling
A whole new world to live in
But this one's real, this one's real
This one's real

Like an old, tired kangaroo
You be one and I'll be one too
Play it goofy or play it cool
[Incomprehensible]

Everything that happened
You know it don't mean a thing to us
'Cause so much is going to happen

Because you showed me
A sunset overflowing
But who cares where it's going
As long as you're next to me
