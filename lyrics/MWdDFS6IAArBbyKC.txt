Lord you know I've cried a thousand tears tonight
But nothing seems to quench the thirst you keep on craving
But now I need an answer to my prayers and you're not there
So why think you listen? Listen!
Has no one told you!, your cries are all in vain
And everyone keeps trying to take that all away
Has no one told you!, Your cries are all in vain
Your Cries!
Lord, I can't disguise the look inside my eyes
The more I try to look away the more I'm staring
But now I need an answer to my prayers and you're not there
So why I think you listen? Listen!
Has no one told you, your cries are all in vain
And everyone keeps trying to take that all away
Has no one told you, your cries are all in vain
Your cries.
Your cries in vain I look away!
Has no one told you, your cries are all in vain
And everyone keeps trying to take that all away
Has no one told you, your cries are all in vain
Your cries.
Has nobody told you when you look away
The stories they told you still run through your veins
Has nobody told you when you look away
The stories they told you still run through your
Run through your veins!
