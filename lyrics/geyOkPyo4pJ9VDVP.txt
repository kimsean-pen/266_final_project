Born into the fight
Fed on the blood
Raised on the rage
Born into the cage
Held in a choke all day
So keep my guard up, chin down
You call me a beast
Yeah beast
I live off the meat thrown at my feet
Are you liking the show?
Call me out of my mind but no no no,
I'm out of your mind
'cause I'm boo'ed, cheered, boo'ed, and cheered on by you,
Yeah you
The pigs in the suits, with so much to lose
It's easy to win when you
You think that you know
Know what you're worth,
But once you step on my turf,
A pen is a pen, a sword a sword
So come in
By design,
I'm out of your mind
You're in trouble when you fight in my fight
You're in trouble when you fight in my fight
I'm gonna burst that bubble when you fight in my fight
'cause you know, see, feel, I'm out of your mind
You're in trouble when you fight in my fight
You're in trouble when you fight in my fight
Point all you want and say I'm out of my mind
but no, no, no
I'm out of your mind
Born into the fight
Fed on the blood
Raised on the rage
