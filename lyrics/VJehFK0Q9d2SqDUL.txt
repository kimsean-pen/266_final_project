Skinny skinny skinny
Get down on the floor
Don't be shy you know you blow my my mind
Skinny skinny skinny
Get down on the floor

What you do follows through your a man of your word
In case you haven't heard
I think I like em skinny damn those jeans are tight I'll help you unwind hmm
I saw him checking me from the bar
Ohh he works out but its you that I really want

Skinny skinny skinny
Get down on the floor
Don't be shy you know you blow my my mind
Skinny skinny skinny
Get down on the floor
Give it to me
Don't be shy you know your just my type
Skinny skinny skinny
Get down on the floor

Stoner boy you give me joy
As we dance in the sunrise
Them other men don't have the time
Drink you silly till you can't walk right
I saw him checking me from the bar
Ohh he works out but its you that i really want

Skinny skinny skinny
Get down on the floor
Don't be shy you know you blow my my mind
Skinny skinny skinny
Get down on the floor
Give it to me
Don't be shy you know your just my type
Skinny skinny skinny
Get down on the floor

My hearts been beaten far too many days until i saw your face
You held me close up in your embrace I've never felt so safe

Skinny skinny skinny
Get down on the floor
Don't be shy you know you blow my my mind
Skinny skinny skinny
Get down on the floor
Give it to me
Don't be shy you know your just my type
Skinny skinny skinny
Get down on the floor
