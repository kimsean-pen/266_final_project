I'm over everything you say and you do babe
I'm over everything that we've been through
I'm on a lifeboat, a lifeboat, this lifeboat is sinking
Si-si-sinking, si-sinking
I don't know if we're even pulling through babe
I'm overmedicated thanks to you
I'm on a lifeboat, our lifeboat, this lifeboat is sinking
Si-si-sinking, si-sinking

Save me, yeah
This isn't what it looks like, yeah
This isn't what I wanted, yeah
This isn't what it looks like, yeah

Lifeboat, l-lifeboat, l-lifeboat
Lifeboat, our lifeboat is sinking

I'm over everything you say and you do babe
I'm closing up but do you even care that I do?
We're on a lifeboat, our lifeboat, this lifeboat is sinking
Si-si-sinking, si-sinking

Save me, yeah
This isn't what it looks like, yeah
This isn't what I wanted, yeah
This isn't what it looks like, yeah

Save me, yeah
This isn't what it looks like, yeah
This isn't what I wanted, yeah
This isn't what it looks like, yeah

Throw up your hands, I'm celebrating
Sliver of land, hallucinating
I'm going down, down, down, down, down, down, down, ooh
Shout out my name, I am the sunshine
Here comes the rain, let's have a good time
I'm going down, down, down, down, down, down, down, ooh

I'm at the bottom of my wishing well
But do you even care that I am?
We're on a lifeboat, our lifeboat, this lifeboat is sinking
Si-si-sinking, si-sinking, sinking
Lifeboat, a lifeboat, yeah

Save me, yeah
This isn't what it looks like, yeah
This isn't what I wanted, yeah
This isn't what it looks like, yeah

Lifeboat, a lifeboat, a lifeboat
Lifeboat, a lifeboat, a lifeboat
Lifeboat, a lifeboat, a lifeboat
Lifeboat, our lifeboat is sinking
