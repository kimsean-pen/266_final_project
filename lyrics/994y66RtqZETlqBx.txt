As soon as I'm left alone
The devil wanders into my soul
And I pretend to myself
And I pretend to myself

I go out to the old milestone
Insanely expecting you to come there, knowing
That I wait for you there
That I wait for you there

Come, come, come here at once
Come, come, on a night with no moon

Because all of my being is now in pining
All of my being is now in pining

What finally cheered me now seems
Insignificant, insignificant
