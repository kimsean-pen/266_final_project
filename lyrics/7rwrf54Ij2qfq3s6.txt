I am born in the London
I am no vulture, this is my culture

The laws of nature, ... all listen friends
We come from chaos, you cannot change us
Cannot explain us and that's what makes us
We are the ageless, we are teenagers
We are the focused out of the hopeless
We are the last chance, we are the last dance

One drop in all of this ocean
Not gotta be causing commotion
One drop not follow the motion
Not drop no proper emotion
One drop in all of this ocean
Get proper, follow the motion
Get proper drop of emotion
Not gotta be causing commotion

One drop

We all go down

The laws of nature, be for all us a lesson friend
We come from chaos, you cannot change us
Cannot explain us and that's what makes us
We are the ageless, we are teenagers
We are the focused out of the hopeless

One drop in all of this ocean
Not gotta be causing commotion
One drop not follow the motion
Not gut no proper emotion
One drop in all of this ocean
Get proper, follow the motion
Get proper drop of emotion
Not gotta be causing commotion

We come from chaos, you cannot change us
Cannot explain us and that's what makes us
We are the ageless, we are teenagers
We are the focused out of the hopeless
Born in the London, out of London, born in the London

But really we are born everywhere

One drop in all of this ocean
Not gotta be causing commotion
One drop not follow the motion
Not gut no proper emotion
One drop in all of this ocean
Get proper, follow the motion
Get proper drop of emotion
Not gotta be causing commotion

We come from chaos, you cannot change us
Cannot explain us and that's what makes us
We are the ageless, we are teenagers
We are the focused out of the hopeless

Now follow the motion

Get proper

Get proper, proper emotion
Not gotta be causing commotion
One drop in all of this ocean
I Get proper, now follow the motion

Get proper, proper emotion
Not gotta be causing commotion
One drop in all of this ocean
I Get proper, now follow the motion

Get proper, proper emotion
