Thomas said stay at home, get away from me
Sayin' I was bad for you, he got his way
I'm gone for good
Making up stories, keepin' it secret
Takin' your word for truth
You were bad for me
So I'm gone for good

I did all I could
So kiss this one more time
'Cause I'm gone for good
You misunderstood
So kiss this one last time
And I'm gone for good

Thomas said sorry
Coming home crawling
Didn't give a shit before
He stole from me
So I'm gone for good (Hey!)
Getting back from this, no second chances
Another phone call ignored
You're bad for me
But I'm gone for good

I did all I could
So kiss this one more time
'Cause I'm gone for good
You misunderstood
So kiss this one last time
And I'm gone for good

Can I get a little?
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah ah, ah, ah, ah-aoh ah, ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Kiss this
Ah, ah, ah, ah-aoh ah, ah, ah, ah-aoh ah, ah, ah, ah-aoh, ah
Kiss this

Kiss this

I did all I could
So kiss this one more time, one more time
I did all I could
So kiss this one more time
'Cause I'm gone for good
You misunderstood
So kiss this one last time
And I'm gone for good

Can I get a little?
Ah, ah, ah, ah-aoh ah, ah, ah, ah-aoh ah, ah, ah, ah-aoh, ah
Kiss this
Ah, ah, ah, ah-aoh ah, ah, ah, ah-aoh ah, ah, ah, ah-aoh, ah
Kiss this
