I'd rather go to the stake
I'd rather go to the stake
I'd rather burn, oh I'd rather burn
I'd rather burn at the stake

But know I'll return and I'll be dead awake
I'll be dead awake, rising from the stake

And when you hear the following tune
You'll know, you'll know
When you hear the following tune
You'll know that I'll be with you
And when you hear the following tune
You'll know, you'll know
When you hear the following tune
You'll know that I'll be with you soon

I'll show you I am capable of causing such pain
With my delicate and fragile lady brain
I will not let you get away
I'd rather burn at the stake

But know I'll return and I'll be dead awake
I'll be dead awake, rising from the stake

And when you hear the following tune
You'll know, you'll know
When you hear the following tune
You'll know that I'll be with you
And when you hear the following tune
You'll know, you'll know
When you hear the following tune
You'll know that I'll be with you soon

Dadada dada dada dada dada da
Dadada dada dada dada dada da

Won't let you take my soul away
I'd rather go to the stake
I'd rather burn, oh I'd rather burn
I'd rather burn at the stake
