You've stolen my heart and I want you to remember
now what'll I do? living alone
you've stolen my heart and it hurts me to remember
now where'll I go to? living alone

and a butterfly in the wind is drifting like I do
it's dumb - I know what I want to say
but I can't even take one breath

as night falls I hear voices on the radio
(ooh) I'll follow their dreams
and wake up alone

and a butterfly in the wind is drifting like I do
it's dumb - I know what I want to say
but I can't even take one breath
so now still burning silently away
a storm without the thunder
