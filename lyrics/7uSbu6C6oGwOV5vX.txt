This is our way of life
And we sleep away our misery in our blood soaked sheets
We've left our homes to infect the world
And addict you all to this deep south heat

Our bodies full of scars
Infinite blood to bleed
Our Presence stops your heart
And leaves you six feet deep
Fall to your knees
And recognize your new found kings

Where we come from
The saw is the law
When there's no hope left
We will will not fall
Among the giants we still stand tall
And we will not be stopped

Just let it go and let the wind blow
It's like a hurricane inside of your head

The pressure's never ending
But your brain is still depending and comprehending
Why it is still defending just let go
And be one with the family
Your life decisions have become our control
And we will swallow this world whole

You are
You are nothing
We are everything
You are nothing, without us

This is our way of life
Taking cities one by one
Carefully choose your side
You could be one of many sons

This is our way of life
Deafening Ears and shutting mouths
Come and join our side
Welcome to the deep south

This is our way of life
We've left our homes to infect the world
And addict you all to this deep south heat

Our bodies full of scars
Infinite blood to bleed
Our Presence stops your heart
And leaves you six feet deep
Fall to your knees
And recognize your new found kings

Where we come from
The saw is the law
When there's no hope left
We will will not fall
Among the giants we still stand tall
And we will not be stopped

Just let it go and let the wind blow
It's like a hurricane inside of your head

The pressure's never ending
But your brain is still depending and comprehending
Why it is still defending just let go
And be one with the family
Your life decisions have become our control
And we will swallow this world whole
You are nothing
We are everything
You are nothing
We are everything
You are nothing
We are everything
