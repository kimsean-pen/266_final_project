I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire
I use a cobra snake for a neck tie
I got a brand new house on the roadside
Made from rattlesnake hide
I got a brand new chimney made on top
Made out of human skull
Come on take a little walk with me
Arlene tell me who do you love?

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Tombstone hand and a graveyard mind
Just twenty-two and I don't mind dying
?
?
I rode around the town used a rattlesnake whip
Take it easy baby don't you give me no lip now

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
(I said) Who do you love?
(Ah well) Who do you love? (she said)

The night was dark and the sky was blue
Down the alley and an ice wagon flew
Somebody screamed you should've heard what I've seen
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Well Arlene took me by the hand she said
"Oh, you boy, don't you understand"
"Oh, boy, dear don't you know?"
"Ah Understand, understand"
Who do you love? she said
Who do you love? she said
Who do you love? she said
Who do you love? she said

(Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?)
