Yeah
Yeah, Yeah

Since I came home, Police across the street taking pictures right when I came home

Nigga get a watch, and a couple chains think he harder than you
Drop the jewelry, grow some dreads, think he smarter than you
Please yourself or please your homies, man what's harder to do?
Did some things in life I know I don't want my daughter to do
Shit, got a list of things don't want my daughter to do
On the blade, tryna get paid, choppin hard with the crew
Type of shit I did to make me feel a part of the crew
Til I cut my niggas off now I'm apart from the crew
I'm playing my own so I cannot play yall positions for my niggas
They hate me [?] watching me got distant from my niggas
Shit's so fake this days I got's to keep a pistol around my niggas
Got me on some Grayson Allen shit, I'm tripping on my niggas, Lord
