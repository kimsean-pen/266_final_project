When the sun is gone away
In the darkness of the night
I don't have to look too hard to see
That I'm living in your light

When I look into your eyes
It all makes perfect sense to me
I didn't know that I could feel this way
I am happy just to be

In your light, in your light
There's no shadow there's no darkness

I don't feel alone without you
Cause I'm living in your light

When I wake up to your face
You don't have to say that it's alright
When I feel you lyin here by me
I know I'm living in your light

In your light, in your light
There's no shadow there's no darkness

I don't feel alone without you
Cause I'm living in your light

In your light, in your light
There's no shadow there's no darkness

I don't feel alone without you
Cause I'm living in your light
