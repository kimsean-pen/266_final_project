Faked our deaths
Lit a match
Closed the door
Waited for the flash
Greyhound Station
we paid in cash
Miss Lazarus, we're coming back

They say it's darkest before the dawn
We've been in this town for far too long
They say it's darkest before the dawn
We're moving on

Sunset
No regrets
First chance last dance
Stuck in the middle
Even bad girls know good love
You taste so sweet it hurts a little

Make our home
Where we stand
One suitcase
And half a plan
Follow the wolves
And sing along
Past the voices
To the Song
