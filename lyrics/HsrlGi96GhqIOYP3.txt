I know I see this all the time
I see the trouble in your eyes
Trouble that money can't fix
And you still dig your ditch

I usually fall for that same old cycle
You see it in white and black
And I'm in the middle

Well, I don't want the same
Maybe I should explain
I've been through this before
Get it all off your chest
No need to pretend that you won't come undone
Come undone

You used to tell me everyday
You know exactly how I get
That's right, I know how you get
That's why I'm walking away
I've learned from this
Broken down, rebuilt from it
You can say you're different
But it's clear you're still the same

I usually fall for that same old cycle
You see it in white and black
And I'm in the middle

Well, I don't want the same
Maybe I should explain
I've been through this before
Get it all off your chest
No need to pretend that you won't come undone
Come undone

I've learned from this
Broken down, rebuilt from it
You can say you're different
But it's clear you're still the same

Sleep in the bed that you made
I know that someone will save ya
They're gonna see all your lies
Ain't no cryin' tonight
It's gonna catch up right where I know it's gonna hurt you most

Well, I don't want the same
Maybe I should explain
I've been through this before
Get it all off your chest
No need to pretend that you won't come undone
Coming undone

Are you coming undone?
Are you coming undone?
Are you coming undone?
Oh, coming undone
Coming undone
