Get the boys high, get the girls high
Get the boys high, get the girls high
Get the boys high

Truth be told I still can't hear the laughter
The musics on but I can't seem to stay
When love is gone love is a disaster
And dancing only ever makes us brave

Girls high

I'm holding on but rhythms pull me faster,
Let's move together making this the place
Where lovers lost can find their inner answers
When dancing only ever makes us brave.

I need to feel something that's real, real
I need to feel my heart can heal, heal

I wanna catch the first light in the morning after
An open hand when night it fades to day
When love is gone and only a disaster
Dancing only ever makes us brave

I need to feel something that's real, real
I need to feel my heart can heal, heal
I need to feel something that's real, real
I need to feel my heart can heal, heal
I need to feel something that's real, real
I need to feel our heart can heal, heal

Get the boys high, get the girls high
Get the boys high, get the girls high
Get the boys high

Truth be told I still can't hear the laughter
The musics on but I can't seem to stay
When love is gone love is a disaster
And dancing only ever makes us brave

High, get the girls high
High, get the girls high
Get the girls high

I think that there's something more to find
I'm finding it feels right
I think that there's something more tonight
Get the girls high, get the boy high

I need to feel something that's real, real
(I think that there's something more to find
I'm finding it feels right)
I need to feel my heart can heal, heal
(I think that there's something more tonight
Get the girls high, get the boy high)
I need to feel something that's real, real
(I need to feel something that's real
I need to feel something that's real)
I need to feel our heart can heal, heal
(I need to feel something that's real
I need to feel something that's real)

I need to feel something that's real
I need to feel something that's real
I need to feel something that's real
I need to feel something that's real
