You're looking at me like I'm preyed upon
I'm gonna give in to you
Anything more and it's game on
Have you ever been in love
I've been sleepwalking the corner of hypnotised
I'm gonna give in to you
I couldn't help it even if I tried
Have you ever been in love

Playing in the garden of glorified
Sleepwalking the corner of hypnotised
Loving in the rubble of a landslide
Waking in the wonder of a sunrise

You're the something on my mind
Butter flutter in my breast
You're the something on my mind
Butter flutter in my breast

I've got a fear I'm running out of time
I'm gonna give in with you
2016 never felt so fragile
Have you ever been in love

We're playing in the garden of glorified
Loving in the rubble of a landslide

You're the something on my mind
Butter flutter in my breast
You're the something on my mind
Butter flutter in my breast

You're the something on my mind
Butter flutter in my breast
You're the something on my mind
Butter flutter in my breast

You're the something on my mind
Butter flutter in my breast
You're the something on my mind
Butter flutter in my breast
