Good times for a change
See the luck I've had
Could make a good man bad

So please, please, please
Let me get what I want
Lord knows it would be the first time

Haven't had a dream in a long time
See the life I've had
Could make a good man bad

So for once in my life
Let me get what I want
Lord knows it would be the last time
Lord knows it would be the first time
