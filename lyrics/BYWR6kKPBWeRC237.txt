What have I been doing here?
And what's the biggest chase?
How will we be listening when we're slipping out of the race?
Roses pushed inside my palm
And rusting with the fun
You've already finished it
When the notion's just begun

And I don't know what I'm doing here and I
Can't say why you would be here

And I've seen roses twelve feet tall
Hearts on their shoulders
And that's not all
And I've seen roses six feet all
Hearts on their shoulders
And that's not all
