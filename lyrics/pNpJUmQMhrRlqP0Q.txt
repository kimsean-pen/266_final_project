Marching along
Like a good soldier does
I'm setting sail, with anchors holding me down
Pack up my bags
Stow them away (stow them away)
Bidding farewell to all that is safe

Will I come up for air, come up for air
After a while the current is calling me, lulling me, waving goodbye
I'm out here alone, oh god can you save me now?
Sinking, my heart turns to stone

Withering away
A shrinking violet dies
So full of life, these lights have dried me out
Into the sea
Needed a drink
I never thought this would consume me whole

Will I come up for air, come up for air
After a while the current is calling me, lulling me, waving goodbye
I'm out here alone, oh god can you save me now?
Sinking, my heart turns to stone (turns to stone)
Sinking my heart turns to stone

Save me, take me home
Over and over again
Save me, take me home
Wishing that this all would end
Save me, take me home
Over and over again
Save me, take me home
Wishing that this all would end

After a while the current is calling me, lulling me, waving goodbye
I'm out here alone, oh god can you save me now?
Sinking, my heart turns to stone
After a while the current is calling me, lulling me, waving goodbye
I'm out here alone, oh god can you save me now?
Sinking, my heart turns to stone (turns to stone)
Sinking, my heart turns to stone

Save me take me home (will I come up for air)
Save me take me home (will I come up for air)
Save me take me home
Over and over again
Save me take me home (wishing that this)
Wishing that all this would end
