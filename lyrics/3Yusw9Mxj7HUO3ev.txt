My love is dangerous, dangerous, my love is dangerous
Always make you bleed, always makes you bleed
Always make you bleed - love is dangerous

Don't follow in my footsteps, you don't belong to me
You only make a mistake, don't try and understand me
Don't try and understand me, all I'm trying to say

My love is dangerous, dangerous, love is dangerous
Make everybody cry, everybody cry
Everybody cry - love is dangerous

Don't waste your time with loving, love don't work for me
Don't try to show your feelings
Step carefully, step carefully, all I'm trying to say

My love is dangerous, because I'm your enemy
Watch your step carefully
'Cause I know, I know, I know, I know, I know me
Dangerous, no can give you guarantee, I'm your one day ecstasy
Next day, no

Dangerous, oh, dangerous, love is dangerous,
Love is dangerous, love is dangerous
All I'm really trying to say to you, love is dangerous

No, go play fire with me, fire dance for me
You no can take a pisstake
Don't go criricise me, no go analyze me,
All I'm trying to say -

My love is dangerous, because I'm your enemy
Watch your step carefully
'Cause I know, I know, I know, I know, I know me
Dangerous, no can give you guarantee, I'm your one day ecstasy
Next day, no

Dangerous, dangerous, my love is dagerous
Always make you bleed
Always make you bleed
Always make you bleed
Love is...
