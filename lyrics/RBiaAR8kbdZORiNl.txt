Tall is the mountain
And deep is the sea
Tall is the mountain
And deep is the sea
Tall is the mountain
And deep is the sea
I don't feel
The spirit walks with me

Dark is the forest
And bitter are the trees
Dark is the forest
And bitter are the trees
Dark is the forest
And bitter are the trees
But I don't feel
The spirit walks with me

Walk with me now
Walk with me
Walk with me now
Walk with me
Walk with me now
Walk with me
Walk with me now
Walk with me

The stars in the heaven
Will light away the sea
The stars in the heaven
Will light away the sea
The stars in the heaven
Will light away the sea
So I don't feel
The spirit walks with me

Oh and I wonder
If someday we'll be free
Oh yeah I wonder
If someday we'll be free
He-yeah I wonder
If someday we'll be free
But I don't feel
The spirit walks with me

The spirit walks with me
The spirit walks with me
I don't feel
The spirit walks with me
