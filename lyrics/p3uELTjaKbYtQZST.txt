You can put it on a shelf
You can watch the dust collect
Don't let 'em die
I crushed it into blue
And wrote a song for you
Put it in your pocket to rest

I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind

So your heart was stolen
From the most beautiful girl in the world
Oh, the winds blew you over

I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind

She told me, "never come back alone"
Never come back alone
Time will heal your soul, it's time
She told me, "never come back alone"
Never come back alone
Time will heal your soul, just time alone
Just time alone, alone
