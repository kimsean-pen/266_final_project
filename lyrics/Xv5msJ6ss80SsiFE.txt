There's a part of me that has no fear
There's a part of you that makes that clear
Never thought that I'd stand next to you
Waiting for the threats to follow through

Hold me tigher
Until the load get lighter
Until the world is safer
Tearing friends from paper
And we'll both move forward
With our lips less awkward
And our hands stop shaking
With the risk we're taking

You know...

We belong together
You've got no idea
Just leave us alone
Just leave us alone
You could try forever
You'll get nowhere near
Just leave us alone
Just leave us alone

There's a place in time for everyone
Drawing on some inner need for calm
There a strength in me to make this stop
Whether you believe it's true or not

Hold me tigher
Until the load get lighter
Until the world is safer
Tearing friends from paper
And we'll both move forward
With our lips less awkward
And our hands stop shaking
With the risk we're taking

You know...

We belong together
You've got no idea
Just leave us alone
Just leave us alone
You could try forever
You'll get nowhere near
Just leave us alone
Just leave us alone

We've got something special
You can't comprehend
Just leave us alone
Just leave us alone
You could try to wreck us
It will never end
Just leave us alone
Just leave us alone

We belong together
You've got no idea
Just leave us alone
Just leave us alone
You could try forever
You'll get nowhere near
Just leave us alone
Just leave us alone

You can't touch us, just leave us alone
You can't fix us, just leave us alone
