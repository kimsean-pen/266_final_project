When I was younger, I thought I could stand on my own
It wasn't easy, I stood like a man made of stone, yeah, yeah
But there was something about you (I want you to know)
It brought a change over me (girl it starting to show)
I've got this feeling inside
Got to have you, have you
Ain't no good to hide

It isn't easy to show
What I'm feeling inside, girl
It isn't easy, I know
When you believe in a man like me

When I get angry I say things I don't want to say
I really mean it, I don't want to leave you this way, yeah yeah
I couldn't help my reaction (I want you to know)
I lose control over you (I just want you to know)
I've got this feeling inside,
Got to have you, have you,
Ain't no good to hide.

It isn't easy to show
What I'm feeling inside, girl.
It isn't easy, I know
When you believe in a man like me.

But there was something about you
It brought a change over me
I've got this feeling inside
Got to have you, have you
Ain't no good to hide

It isn't easy to show
What I'm feeling inside, girl
It isn't easy, I know
When you believe in a man like me
Like me
Can't you see
I've gotta, gotta have you
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

But there was something about you
Yeah, there was something about you, ohhhhh
