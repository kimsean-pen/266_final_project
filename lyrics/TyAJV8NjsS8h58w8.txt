Are you out there
To take away my fear?
I haven't lost my hope
Even though I am so far from my home
I've been living life on the edge
Slip and fall if I take one more step
There's safety in numbers, I guess
But I'm going rogue in the wild, wild west
Wild, wild west
Wild, wild west
Wild, wild
From where I stand
There's a world where you can
All that you lost, you get back
And all that you want, you can have
I've been living my life on the edge
Slip and fall if I take one more step
There's safety in numbers, I guess
But I'm going rogue in the wild, wild west
Wild, wild west
Wild, wild west
Wild, wild
I've been dancing in the moonlight
I've been laughing with this firelight
Living, I've been giving
I've been living with the firelight
I'll be fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine, fine
I've been living my life on the edge
Slip and fall if I take one more step
There's safety in numbers, I guess
But I'm going rogue in the wild, wild west
I've been living too close to the edge
If I fall, who's gonna catch me?
There's safety in numbers, I guess
But I'm going rogue in the wild, wild west
I've been dancing in the moonlight
I've been laughing with this firelight
Living, I've been giving
I've been giving with the firelight
I'll be fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine
