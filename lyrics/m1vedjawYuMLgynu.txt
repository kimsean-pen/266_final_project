They stack the bodies a thousand high
Upon a monument to touch the sky
They crown the peaks
So far estranged
But down in the dirt, nothing has changed
Nothing has changed
Nothing has changed
Nothing has changed
Nothing has changed

Nothing
Nothing

The time has come, there's no escape
The time has come, there's no escape
There's no escape

Into the rabble, the panic seems
One target hits us, another weeps
They scale the walls, their mind's deranged
But down in the dirt, nothing has changed

Nothing has changed
Nothing has changed
Nothing has changed
Nothing has changed

Nothing
Not a thing

The time has come, there's no escape
Time has come, there's no escape
There's no escape
