Yeah, I'm standing outside the bar, like a fish out of water
And I'm sorry to bother you miss, you so fine that I gotta peek
Cause I'm like that, cause I'm like that
I'm gonna buy you all the drinking, I'll be right back
Right back, right back...

Drinks at the bar, with the francette standing so far
But it feels near, if only she looks
I could take her home with me
I'll buy you around, if you come close
Turn up the sound, turn the lights down
Give me a chance, I will take her home with me

You're gonna love this!

Yeah, I don't know what's happening
And I swear in your honor
that in my college girl was biting on my lips like jeffrey dummer
Yeah, it's like that, yeah it's like that
I just drove her back to my place for a night cab

Drinks at the bar, with the francette standing so far
But it feels near, if only she looks
I could take her home with me

I'll buy you around, if you come close
Turn up the sound, turn the lights down
Give me a chance, I will take her home with me

You're gonna love this!

You're gonna love this!

Yeah you know the flashing lights I've got a hold on me
Yeah I'm high on a feeling there's nothing wrong with me
La la la la la
La la la la la
Oh yeah you're gonna love this!
Yeah, you know the flashing lights I've got a hold on me
Yeah I'm high on a feeling there's nothing wrong with me
Yeah you know the flashing lights I've got a hold on me
Yeah I'm high on a feeling there's nothing wrong with me
