Well Con Conn was impatient
It's late, we're leaving tonight
Well Bost, he was impatient
It's late, I need you tonight

Well I can hardly take it
Need my, my Josie tonight
Well I feel that wave
Need my, my Josie tonight
Need my, my Josie tonight

Josie tonight
Josie to fly
My, my Josie tonight
Need my, my Josie tonight
Need my, my Josie tonight

But if you don't cry
I'll take you out
