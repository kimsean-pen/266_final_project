Seems to be
I've got all that I could hope for
The warmth and comfort of a lovin man

But now and then
I'd be starin out the window
Thinking about the loves I never had

Playin with the thought of
You and I apart is
Nothin' but a perilous game

Cuz ev'ry time I think
About my life without you
My world goes dark, so dark
My world goes dark

So I go running, running, running, running
Running right back to you my love (don't you know)

Running, running, running, running
Running right back to you my love

Yeah I'll be running, running, running, running
Running right back to you my love (don't you know)

I'm running, running, running, running
Running right back to you my love

I do fine
Standin' here on my own
My independence keeps me on my feet

Though time to time
I want someone I can lean on
Can't seem to find someone to stand behind me

Lookin all around
For someone to astound me
Blind to who's right in front of me

When finally I see
You're everything I need, dear
Inside and out, and out
Inside and out

Then I'll be running, running, running, running
Running right back to you my love (don't you know)

Running, running, running, running
Running right back to you my love

You'll find me running, running, running, running
Running right back to you my love (don't you know)

I'm running, running, running, running
Running right back to you my love

So I go running, running, running, running
Running right back to you my love (don't you know)

Running, running, running, running
Running right back to you my love

Yeah I'll be running, running, running, running
Running right back to you my love (don't you know)

I'm running, running, running, running
Running right back to you my love
