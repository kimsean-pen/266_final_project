Love is a four letter word

Don't say, it's over
Push me away then you pull me closer
Maybe
We're just addicted to the pain 'cause
We've been here before
So why do we keep coming back for more
Just tell

Why do you do the things you do?
Why you gotta be so complicated?
Look at what you put me through
Maybe your heart was built for breaking
I need to walk away
It's more than I can take
What you see just makes me hurt
Love is a four letter word
Love is a four letter word

I was
Just fine
Before you robbed my heart like a gold mine
I know
I need to find another way 'cause
We've been here before
I know I can't do this anymore
Just tell me

Why do you do the things you do?
Why you gotta be so complicated?
Look at what you put me through
Maybe your heart was built for breaking
I need to walk away
It's more than I can take
What you see just makes me hurt
Love is a four letter word
Love is a four letter word

The way that you love me
Feels like hate
So I must be crazy
If I stay

Why do you do the things you do?
Why do you gotta be so complicated?
Look at what you put me through
Just tell me

Why do you do the things you do?
Why you gotta be so complicated?
Look at what you put me through
Maybe your heart was built for breaking
I need to walk away
It's more than I can take
What you see just makes me hurt
Love is a four letter word
Love is a four letter word
Love is a four letter word
Love is a four letter word
Love is a four letter word
