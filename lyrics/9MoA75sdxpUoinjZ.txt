At dawn, envoy arrives!
Morning of October 28th
"No Day" proven by deed
Descendants of Sparta, Athens and Crete!

Look now, ready to fight!
Enemies charge from the hills
To arms! Facing defeat
There's no surrender! There's no retreat!

Time after time, force their enemies back to the line!

Call to arms banners fly in the wind!
For the glory of Hellas!
Coat of arms reading "freedom or death!"
Blood of king Leonidas!

Air raid! Pounding the land
bombers are flying both day and night
Endure six days of rain!
Dropped by invaders, bomb raid in vain!

Strike hard! The tables have turned
Drive them back over the hills
At arms! Just like before!
Soldiers! Civilians! Hellas at war!

By their own hand, forced the enemy out of their land!

Call to arms banners fly in the wind!
For the glory of Hellas!
Coat of arms reading "freedom or death!"
Blood of king Leonidas!

Just like their ancestors ages ago
Fought in the face of defeat
Those three hundred men left a pride to uphold
Freedom or Death in effect

Then, now again!
Blood of heroes saving their land!

Call to arms banners fly in the wind!
For the glory of Hellas!
Coat of arms reading "freedom or death!"
Blood of king Leonidas!

Call to arms banners fly in the wind!
For the glory of Hellas!
Coat of arms reading "freedom or death!"
Blood of king Leonidas!
