There's a ghost in my house, the ghost of your memory
The ghost of the love that was took from me

Our love used to be only shadows in the past
I see times can't seem to have erased
The vision of your smiling face
The dead flowers I sent thee, I can't get over ye

There's a ghost in my house, I can't hide
For the ghost of the love that's inside
Keeps on haunting me
Just keeps on be callin' me

Down in my tea cup I see your face lookin' up
Sittin' in my easy chair
I feel your fingers running through my hair
Though we're far apart your specter's in my heart

There's a ghost in my house, I can't hide
For the ghost of the love that's inside
Keeps on haunting me
Still just a part of me

By the way I hang my head you can see I'm afraid
Though my heart knows you're gone
My mind keeps rolling on
There's a ghost in my house, I can't hide

In my house I am helpless
I begin to practice superstition
I hear footsteps on the stairs

Keeps on haunting me
(I know there's no one there)
(And I know there's no one there)

There's a ghost in my house, a ghost of your memory
A ghost of the love that was took from me

Ghost in my house, ghost in my house
Ghost in my house
