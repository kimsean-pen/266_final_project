First rays of light are coming through
Been seven months since I saw that much blue
Water rushing in the banks
Freed from the ice, it has the sun, the sun to thank
It has the sun, the sun to thank

Matches inside your golden hair
Catch all the light, I fight to death, I swear
As all the other mothers would remember
Stalked by winter solace in a small, warm hand
We got the sun, the sun to thank
We got the sun, the sun to thank

Every morning rising to the East
Shadows fall behind me, shining never sleep
Till it'll be what I'm asking, no regret
That you pin the arrows in the wheel
Sun, the sun to thank
We've got the sun, the sun to thank
We got the sun, the sun to thank
We've got the sun, the sun to thank

Every morning rising to the East
Shadows fall behind me, shining never sleep
Till it'll be what I'm asking, no regret
That you pin the arrows in the wheel
Sun, the sun to thank
We've got the sun, the sun to thank
We got the sun, the sun to thank
We've got the sun, the sun to thank
