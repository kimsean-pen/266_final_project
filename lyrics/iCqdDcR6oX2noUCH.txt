Take me, take my letters, take my photos, take the sun
You can take my heart
Cause I ain't gonna need it on the run
I've been trying to work it out
But my words fall right apart baby
I'll leave oh, don't you know
I can't deal with the hurt anymore
Oh baby don't leave

Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
No, I can't sleep
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't eat, oh no, no
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't breathe
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love

Autumn, Autumn's coming round
And summer's not the same
It's like winter without your smile
I spent some time just thinking to myself
I picked up one of your photos, and I put it right back on the shelf

Now I can't eat
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
No, no, no, I can't breathe
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
Ooh no, I can't eat
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't breathe
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love

I can't be a day without your smile
You're the one for me but all the while
I just think that we should give all our love
Give love, love, love, love, love

I can't be a day without your smile
You're the one for me but all the while
I just think that we should give all our love
Give love, love, love, love, love

Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
No, no, no, I can't sleep
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
Hey now, I can't eat
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
No, babe, I can't sleep
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love

Baby, baby,
I can't eat
Baby, baby,
I can't-a live
Baby, baby,
uh
Baby, baby,
I cannot eat
Baby, baby,
Baby, baby,
I cannot
Baby, baby,
Baby, baby,

They say love is patient, love is kind
Love ain't never did a thing to mine
Love ain't weak, love is strong
Love be telling my heart don't go
I say love is patient, love is kind
Love ain't never did a thing to mine
Love ain't weak, Greater than pride
I can't live without your love

I can't be a day without your smile
You're the one for me but all the while
I just think that we should give all our love
Give love, love, love, love, love
I can't be a day without your smile
You're the one for me but all the while
I just think that we should give all our love
Give love, love, love, love, love

Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
