A lifetime waiting for the light to shine
Suddenly you were here, like an angel appeared
And the world that I knew changed into a wonderland
Then you called out my name, looked around and I found you were gone
Like the rays of the sun
Disappeared into never ending nights
Where everything real has turned to stone
And the songbird has flown
(You're gone)
Now I know a rose can change a shade of blue
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A shade of blue
My body's hurtin', cryin' and yearnin'
Sometimes I feel like I'm losin' my mind
And I think about you, knowin' only you could understand
Here alone in my room, I can feel all the walls closin' in
Feelin' trapped in a shell
Wishin' that I could spin the wheels of change
'Cause everything real has turned to stone
And the songbird has flown
(You're gone)
Now I know a rose can change a shade of blue
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A shade of blue
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A shade of blue
Everything real has turned to stone
And the songbird has flown
(You're gone)
Now I know a rose can change
Everything real has turned to stone
And the songbird has flown
(You're gone)
Now I know a rose can change a shade of blue
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A shade of blue
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A shade of blue
(Sometimes I feel like I'm losin' my mind)
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A shade of blue
I can feel all the walls closin' in
