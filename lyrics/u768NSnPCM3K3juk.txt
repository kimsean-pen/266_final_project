And there's three
Oh, count 'em three
Children playin' on the beach
They were eager to learn
To be taught
And to teach
There's Veronica
She's biting her lip
As she watches the waves turn white at the tip
And there's Vader
Radiating with joy
And luckily she still can't stand the sight of a boy
And lastly there's Dade
His hair dances in the wind and he's
Wondering where the love is
And why
It has to
End
And he can't understand
How everyone goes on
Breathing when true love ends
Yeah, his mother whispers quitely

Heaven's not a place that you go when die
It's that moment in life when you actualy feel alive
Oh yeah, live for the moment
Well take this advice
Live by every word
Love is just a hoax
So forget everything that you have heard
Oh yeah, live for the moment now

And there's three
Oh, count 'em three
Children growing up on the beach
They were eager to learn
To be taught
And to teach
There's Veronica
She's licking her lips
As she waits for her real first passionate kiss
And there's Vader
She can't admit her jealousy of her
Sister Veronica and how she's so pretty
And lastly there's Dade
(Still) Sitting on the dock
And he ponders his life and he skips his rocks
And wonders when his father will return
But he's not coming back
And he can't understand
How everyone goes on
Breathing when true love ends
Yeah, his mother whispers quietly

Heaven's not a place that you go when you die
It's that moment in life when you actually feel alive
Oh yeah, live for the moment
Well take this advice
Live by every word
Love is just a hoax
So forget everything that you have heard
Oh yeah, live for the moment now

And there's three
Oh, count 'em three
Children missing from the beach
They were eager to learn
To be taught
And to teach
But the sad thing
Is that they never lived past the age of 15
Due to neglect
From their mother
Who was bedridden by her ex-lover
Their father
Oh no
And she didn't even notice or pay much attention
As the tide came in and swept her three into the ocean
Now all her advice
It seems useless
Oh no

No, heavens not a place where you go when you die
It's that moment in life when you touch her and you feel alive
Oh yeah, live for the moment
Well, take this advice
Live by every word
Love's completely real
So forget everything that you have heard
Oh yeah, live for the moment now
