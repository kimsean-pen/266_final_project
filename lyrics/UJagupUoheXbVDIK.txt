For everything I have done
And everything I didn't do
For everything I've become
It wasn't up done to you
For everything I have said
For everything I didn't say
For everything you have read
It wasn't ah, true that day

Oh, nothing's gonna change my mind
I'll always love you
Oh, nothing's gonna change inside
I'm always gonna feel as I do

For everything I've seen
And everything I have shown
Everywhere I've been
And everyone I have known
So for every lie I told
I've been well paid in kind
For now when I am old
I have a peaceful mind
For every choice I've made
For every chance I've missed
For every price I've paid
I'm in depth a long long list
Oh, nothing's gonna change my mind
I'll always love you
Oh, nothing's gonna change inside
I'm always gonna feel as I do

It's all about you
I try to say I'm sorry
You say it is true
It was all about you
I tried to say I'm sorry
Don't you say it isn't true

All about you
All about you
It's all about you
Oh, all about you
All about you
It's all about you

Oh, nothing's gonna change my mind
I'll always love you
Oh, nothing's gonna change inside
I'm always gonna feel as I do
