Whuhuu
His face could melt the heart of a rock's motto
But not quite me
Oh he's not quite masked of the human race
I put his face under water
To see how the vision will change
But it's not him that's changed
It's me that's starting to picture
Wuhuu

Isolation
Room for creation
Huh-Huh-Huh
Huh-Huh-Huh

Sometimes I wonder do you even realize?
Or are you just another deaf beneath the eyes
You are the perfect miss between her and glamour
But I wonder what you'll be like tomorrow

Isolation
Room for creation
Huh-Huh-Huh
Huh-Huh-Huh
