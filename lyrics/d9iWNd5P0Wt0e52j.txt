Castigation of the offenders, no punishment out of bounds
Requirement of elucidation, no options to evade

Modify, adapt, and change the rules as you please
Justify to no one, all the reasons for your actions
Dismantle from the pulpit, anyone blocking your path
Appalled in disbelief, the witness of the audacity

Treaties of the past, can't be found
By constraints
None shall dictate, the privilege
Others are devoid of
Ethos of coercion

Subordinates implement, all warranted bidding
Requisitions honored, securing selfish esteem
Skepticism marred, fear of condemnation
Persecuting the chosen, for the lack of adherence

Seize, consign, demand, all detail
Lie, dispatch, diffuse, will convey
Acquiring comrades for the endeavor
Diminish culpability
Gloat, success, above, absolute
