We sustain all the holes in the tracks of our
(Brocken ways)
We refrain from the let downs, and come
downs of (Yesterday)
We maintain the statements, an moments
(that define our lives)
We obtain restless feelings that keep us
moving
(Through the day)

We won't sustain

We sustain all the head wind blowing in
(in our face)
We attain rewards for behaving
(The right way)
We may gain from the turmoil and torments
(That come our way)
We contain restless feelings that keep us
moving
(Through the day)

We won't sustain

We sustain all the holes in the tracks of our
(Broken aways)
We will strain
To remain in the hands of our (destiny)

Thought we contain
All the pieces to lay down (the puzzle)
We still play our parts to keep us moving

Sustain
