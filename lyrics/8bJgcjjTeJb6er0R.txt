Lowdown, cheatin', ain't no need for repeatin'
So love, dawn, can't you see?
That you never gotta fight with me

No you never gotta fight with me

Hurtin', beatin' ain't no need for repeatin'
So love dawn can't you see
That you never gotta bleed for me

Chancing, glancing, so enough mood for romancing
So love dawn can't you see
That you only gotta dance with me

Yeah you only gotta dance with me
Yeah you only gotta dance with me
Yeah you only gotta dance with me
