my heart
bleeds about it
bleeds about it today

its hard but i know
that ill make it
to the kingdom one day

I was a fool yeahh
never thinking
of the choices I made

Shyness let it go
never have to be alone

shyness

never have to feel so lonely
shyness

under the moonlight
i was waiting
for an answer some way

i walked in shadows
was unfaithful
to the people who care

my heart
bleeds about her
bleeds about her
today

shyness
let it go
never have to be alone

shyness

let it go
never have to feel so lonely

shyness
