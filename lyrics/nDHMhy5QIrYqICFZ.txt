It's you and your world and
I'm caught in the middle
I caught the edge of a knife and
It hurts just a little
And I know, and I know, and I know
And I know that I can't be your friend
It's my head or my heart
And I'm caught in the middle

My hands are tied, but not tight enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

Eyes wide shut and it feels
Like the first time (Oh)
Before the rush to my blood was
Too much and we flatlined (Oh)
And I know, and I know, and I know
And I know just how this ends
Now I'm all messed up and it feels
Like the first time (Oh)

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

My hands are tied, but not tight enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let's be lonely together
(Let's be lonely lonely lone.)
(Let's be lonely lonely lone.)
A little less lonely together
A little less lonely now
A little less lonely now
A little less lonely now
