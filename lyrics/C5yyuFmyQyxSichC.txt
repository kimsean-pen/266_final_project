Lilies may grow
Even through the snow
The sun will rise
Sparkle your eyes
The wind shall blow bad trash away
When anguish is near
Somebody please polish the stars
For their skin is dull
Somebody please awaken the sun
And never let it fall
Somebody please stir up the sky
Emotionally so it must cry
Somebody please polish the stars
(Lilies may grow)
For their skin is dull
(Even through the snow)
Somebody please awaken the sun
(The sun will rise)
And never let it fall
(Sparkle your eyes, sparkle your eyes)
Somebody please stir up the sky
(The wind shall blow)
Bad trash away when anguish is near
Bad trash away when anguish is near
The wind shall blow bad trash away
When anguish is near
Bad trash away when anguish is near
