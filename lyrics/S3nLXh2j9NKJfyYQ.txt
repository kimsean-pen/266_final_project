Shut the fuck up!

Why
Would you always go take our side?!?
But now!
You're gonna bless to me a goodbye
You fail!
I'm everything!
You lost!
You're dust to me!

Don't fuck with me!
Don't fuck with me!
You're gonna die!

But for the best, for the rest
for every person to think of, to the blessed, to be traced!
(Fight for your faith!)
Just your mates, and their fate
does not mean that you don't ever hate, never wait
(Don't fuck with me)

You fail!!
I'm everything!
You lost!

I walk on my enemies,
I stand unbreakable!
This is for the weak...

Shut your fucking mouth!!!

Better be afraid! (to feel the pain)
I'm torched up (can't ruin me)
You're gonna fucking die (my only aim)
Prepare to fight (take your side)
So for the best for the rest for everything that was taught to me, picture me, the faith!
So choose your mates and your fate that was on fought upon for discipline! this to me, was fate!

Oh!
Don't fuck with me,
You lost,
You're dust to me!

Have you ever been standing last?
Because I watched you going inside and out.
Did you ever forget the past?
Because I need you to forgive me instead
