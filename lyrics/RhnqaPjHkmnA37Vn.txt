Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

With all our lives, let's build the future
Let's train a band, a plan for one another
We've got a pulse, don't be a victim
Another chance to not be the afflicted

Another cynical, a little critical
We're not the ones that seem to wanna make life difficult
We're all alive, let's build the future
Let's train a band, a plan for one another
We're all alive
(Let's build the future, build the future)

Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

No killing time, we're gonna use it
Can't turn it back around so don't abuse it
We've got a voice, let's break the silence
Another chance to think and show defiance

Look at our history, don't put it on repeat
Let's make a stand and drag ourselves out of this misery
No killing time, we've gotta use it
Can't turn it back around so don't abuse it
Are you alive

Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Tell me a miracle, this isn't typical
Tell me to be revived
'Cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Tell me a miracle, this isn't typical
Tell me to be revived
Tell me a miracle, this isn't typical
Tell me to be revived

Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
