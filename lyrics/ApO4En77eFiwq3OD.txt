She's black and red and built just like a spy plane
Extracting information from my mind
The photographs she takes save to a mainframe
For your eyes only lonely cold war time (of mine)

Now after all the city falls just like the night or an angel does

Leave me here alone to collect my things
She sees music in the terror she brings
And like a Technicolor dream
The light in your eyes blinded me
From your perch you softly smiled
My Blackbird softly smiled

She's built for speed and made for keeping secrets
Stark and dark against enemy skies
From miles above the earth no one can detect her
My Blackbird blows a kiss that ends mankind (goodbye)

And all this time there is no crime of treason that she hasn't seen

Leave me here alone to collect my things
She sees music in the terror she brings
And like a Technicolor dream
The light in your eyes blinded me
From your perch you softly smiled
My Blackbird softly smiled

SR 71 Blackbird from the hell above
She's the only one
Only spy I ever loved
She's the only spy I ever loved
(She's the only spy I ever loved)

Now after all the city falls just like the night or an angel does

Leave me here alone to collect my things
She sees music in the terror she brings
And like a Technicolor dream
The light in your eyes blinded me
From your perch you softly smiled
My Blackbird softly smiled

SR 71 Blackbird from the hell above
She's the only one
Only spy I ever loved
