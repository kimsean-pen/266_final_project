Björk
Eat me
Eat me love
Leave nothing behind
Swallow me, all of me
Drink me love
Pour me in you
Devour me
Drink me in large gulps

Einar
I hate you! I really do, I think I do,
I really, I really hate you!

Björk
I need you closer
I want him now
I want him in me
Eat me love!

Einar
Never say love to anyone!

Björk
Consume me love
I want you
To inhale me all of me
Drown me love
In a bottomless pond
I'll never return
Swallow me, all of me

Einar
I don't love you! I really hate you!

Björk
I want you closer
I want him now
I want him in me
Eat me love!
Swallow me, all of me X3

Einar
I hate you!

Björk
He's coming closer
He's coming now
He's gonna touch me
Eat me love!

Einar
I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate you!

Björk
Eat me love, your open mouth
Eat me love, I, on your tongue
You got to eat me love
Eat me love, you gulp me
Eat me love, I, I down your gullet
You eat me love
Eat me love- I in the stomach
Eat me love, eat me love
You splash acid on me
Eat me love, I travel down the intestines
Eat me love, through the bowels and out!

He's coming closer
He wants me now
I want to eat him
Eat me love! X3
You got to eat me love!

Einar
I hate you
