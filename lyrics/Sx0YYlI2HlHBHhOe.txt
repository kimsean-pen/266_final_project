I cannot do this anymore
It's getting harder and harder to stand tall
It comes to the point when not even dreams can save you
Or God forgive you

I need savior
A liberator
Deus ex machina
A celestial defender

No fear, no outcry
I'm the only hero left alive
Testify, mortify, crucify
I'm the only hero left alive
Falsify, glorify, sanctify
I'm the only hero left alive

It's about time to end this
Don't let the fire burn out
It's about time for you to back down
Stop wasting my time

It's about time to stand up
And take back what rightfully is mine
A skydweller never says goodbye

I cannot feel anything anymore
Indifferent, no longer heartsore
No blood left to bleed out
I am what dreams can make you when God forsakes you

I need a savior
A liberator
Deus ex machina
A celestial defender

No fear, no outcry
I'm the only hero left alive
Testify, mortify, crucify
I'm the only hero left alive
Falsify, glorify, sanctify
I'm the only hero left alive

It's about time to end this
Don't let the fire burn out
It's about time for you to back down
Stop wasting my time

It's about time to stand up
And take back what rightfully is mine
A skydweller never says goodbye

It's about time to stand up
And take back what rightfully is mine
A skydweller

It's about time to end this
Don't let the fire burn out
It's about time for you to back down
Stop wasting my time

It's about time to stand up
And take back what rightfully is mine
A skydweller

Never says goodbye
Never says goodbye
Never says goodbye
