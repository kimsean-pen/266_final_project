It's over now
Emotions still erratic but I'm sober now
But if there was a shining road for me to take
I'd call upon a darker path to show itself
Have you ever seen me act in such a state
In times of stress just go and look the other way
I lost another charger up in Soho House
Before the driver took me to another place
And so...
My head isn't straight, I'm in pain
Take me away
And throw me in the midst of lust
Pray the label covers us
It feels like my bed is a hospital bed
The time is now
For me to claw myself away from pain and doubt
And carry on my shoulders what I started when
Pleasing you was all I really was about
Maybe you'd have someone if I left you then
And so I keep in mind you might have gone away
And taken on another person's blood to drink
I think the arrangement that we both have is great
It's death at whom I stare
I think she's unaware
And so...
My heart is enlarged and enflamed
Put me in graves
And throw me in the midst of lust
Pray the label covers us
It feels like my bed is a hospital bed
