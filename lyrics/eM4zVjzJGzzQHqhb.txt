Listen to instructions carefully
While bumpin' this album in your jeeps
Aaliyah's got a 90's swing
So be careful with, the volume please
Yeah, hmm

So if you're down with the funky flavor
Throw your hands up
And if you got the fever for Aaliyah

Throw your hands up
And if you're down with black ground
Throw your hands up
And if you got soul
Let me see your hands up
If you got bass in your jeep
Throw your hands up
And if your not down with the crack

Throw your hands up
And if you think you're hype enough to swing it
Throw your hands up
And if you're down with the second chapter
Throw your hands up
