I'm living incomplete
My mind is racing day to day
It's bleeding every part of me
I've been swimming in desire
That's fuelling my soul
But I can't feed this fire alone

I can't feel alive
If I can't breathe the air that's been frozen
When you're so far away
And I just need to find
A simple kind of way to keep you closer
'Cause you're every part of me

Am I everything you'll need?
Are you craving me the same way?
Inside my body's screaming
I'm addicted to your taste
And the way you like to show me
How we've become one in the same

I can't feel alive
If I can't breathe the air that's been frozen
When you're so far away
And I just need to find
A simple kind of way to keep you closer
'Cause you're every part of me

Every night, I've been bleeding
It's tearing me apart down to my bones
Every time I feel completed
There's always one more thing
Reminding me that I'm not whole
How can I let you go?

I can't feel alive
If I can't breathe the air that's been frozen
When you're so far away
And I just need to find
A simple kind of way to keep you closer
'Cause you're every part of me
Every part of me
Every part of me
