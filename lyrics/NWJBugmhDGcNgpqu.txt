Living in right now, in heaven, in this town
'Cause I'll never fade away, I never needed a crown
We've only come this far, so cover up your scars
And I'll never feel the pain, I just look to the stars
Right now it cuts me up, but it's understood that
Deep down it fucks me up, but it feels so good
So never say never, it's every breath that I treasure
I'm in love with right now, tonight I'll live forever

Like whoa, whoa, live right now
It doesn't matter if you're heaven or hell bound
Like whoa, whoa, live right now
It doesn't matter if you're heaven or hell bound

Everybody wants to live forever, but who am I to say?
I just want a life we will remember, we're living for today
'Cause tonight we'll fight to take this world and make it all our own
Everybody wants to live forever, come and follow me, we'll never be alone

This is who I am, your soul is my romance
If everybody's letting go, let's do it with both hands
I've lived in the darkness, I'm tired of the shade
If everybody's letting go, I just wanna be saved
Right now, this is who I wanna be
Deep down, all I want is everything
I mean every word and I mean every letter
And as long as you believe me, maybe we can live forever

Like whoa, whoa, live right now
It doesn't matter if you're heaven or hell bound
Like whoa, whoa, live right now
It doesn't matter if you're heaven or hell bound

Everybody wants to live forever, but who am I to say?
I just want a life we will remember, we're living for today
'Cause tonight we'll fight to take this world and make it all our own
Everybody wants to live forever, come and follow me, we'll never be alone

We're living right now, so sing it out loud
We're living right now, so sing it out loud
Let's go

Everybody wants to live forever, but who am I to say?
I just want a life we will remember, we're living for today
'Cause tonight we'll fight to take this world and make it all our own
Everybody wants to live forever, come and follow me, we'll never be alone

Like whoa, whoa, live right now
It doesn't matter if you're heaven or hell bound
Like whoa, whoa, live right now
It doesn't matter if you're heaven or hell bound
