Somebody smart
Once spoke and said
Don't put into your mouth
What you picked up from the floor
And yet I keep stumbling
In the weirdest scenes
Warnings sure did ignore
Sniffing the carpet for
Trasures lost and engulfed real deep
Leftover party crumbs
Cat hair, blueberry gum
Someday the worms will find this bottom
Itch it right to the core
Give me my due and more

Do dial on when you feel we've gone beneath
I'll remind you where I've been hiding the keys
I ain't never taking no double blind chance again
Until another curiosity tumbles in
I ain't never taking no
Taking no dumb blind chance again
Till another curiosity
Knocks me in the chin

No blind chance again

Nobody right
Wants a spanking

In public for all to know
How close they're to the bone
Bluest of skies
They just seem to fall
Whenever badpussy pores
Bloom into metaphors
The future coasts
More than whats left
Of assets long gained at birth
Like Theuderic the first
Gathering steam it seems
I'd rather mess it all up before
Crumbling under the bore

Dial on when you feel we've gone beaneath
I'll remind you where I've been hiding the keys
I ain't never taking no dumd blind chance again
Until another curiosity tumbles in
I ain't never taking no
Taking no dumb blind chance again

Till another curiosity
Knocks me in the chin

No blind chance again

No blind chance again
No blind chance again
Again
The truck it reeks
My butt is weak
The sun the heat
Is turning us
Into rotting meat

Oh soaked wet seats
My soul is leeks
Please do something
The truck it reeks
My butt is weak
The sun, the heat
Is turning us
Into rotting meat
Oh soaked wet seats
My soul it leeks
Please do something
