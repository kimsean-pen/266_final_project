No lord shall stand before myself

I can strike the light and see through the truth
For I'm the Deicide, Dominus, what could you do
Thou has failed you now, once again and always will
On the cross, forgotten son, a sacrifice it had to be done

Chorus:
Died for me, well that's too bad I don't believe
Killed by sins of the evil what I am
Your destruction, reasons of a world in pain
Blind disciple, you will never live again

Wage of death, course of life
Unsematic birth of the Deicide
Eyes of pain, pleads to death
As you're put to rest

Three days to rise
If he lives again he is sure to die
I killed Jesus
Just to see him bleed on his pulpis throne
I am evil
I'm the Deicide and i killed the lord
No more reasons
I will kill the world in another form

I rule this world

NAIL HIM

(Lead-Brain)

I can strike the light and see trought the truth
For I'm the Deicide, Dominus, what could you do
Thou has failed you now, once again and always will
On the cross, forgotten son, a sacrificeit had to be done

Repeat chorus
