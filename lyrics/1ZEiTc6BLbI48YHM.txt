Face your faith
remove all the lace
you love me to death
but death may love you more

you paint with glaze
but write me without grace
you love me to death
our love was mortal hope

oh you love me to death
but death may love you more

you grow in me
and although we disagree
you love me to death

you can not love me more

the best things in life to find
will not always satisfy
you can love me to death
but I will have to go

oh you love me to death
but I will have to go
oh you love me to death
but I will let you go
oh you love me to death
but I will let you go
oh you love me to death
but I will let you go
