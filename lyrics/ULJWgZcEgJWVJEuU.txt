Wake up to the blue sky
Grab your shades and let's go for a ride
Breakfast by the ocean
We'll do lunch at Sunset and Vine

Every day's a dream in California
Every night the stars come out to play
Wish that I could always
Feel this way

There's something about the sunshine, baby
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
Out of this world for the first time, baby
Oh, it's so right

There's something about the sunshine
There's something about the sunshine

In Hollywood, we're rocking
In Malibu, we hang out and chill
It's all about the shopping
From Melrose to Beverly Hills

Everywhere's a scene and now we're in it
I don't want to paint this town alone
When I see your smile
I always feel at home

There's something about the sunshine, baby
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
L.A.'s a breeze with the palm trees swayin'
Oh, it's so right

Now that you're here
It's suddenly clear
The sun's coming through, I never knew
Whatever I do, it's better with you
(It's better with you)

There's something about the sunshine, baby
(Something about it)
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
(Whole new light)
Out of this world for the first time, baby
(Yeah)
Oh, it's so right
(So right)

There's something about the sunshine, baby
(There's something about it)
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
(A whole new light)
Out of this world for the first time, baby
(Oh)
Oh, it's so right
There's something about the sunshine, baby
(Something about it)
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
LA's a breeze with the sunshine swayin'
Oh, it's so right
(So right)
There's something about the sunshine...
