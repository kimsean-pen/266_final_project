Knew the time to leave had come
When you pointed out your ring
Never could see
What was in this matrimony thing

Baby, baby, baby, baby
You sure made a noise when I left
And your father started shouting
Lest you ironed my shirts 'fore I left

Would've liked to explain first
But it was a split decision thing
Couldn't see me settling down
With a mortgage and a kid

Now I hear you've been looking for me
Combing every single inch
You'll probably find me in Hyde park
Try the hotel first then a bench

Baby, baby, baby, baby
I've changed my address
I didn't mean to make you cry
But I know it's for the best

Baby, baby, baby, baby
I've changed my address
It's ok being in love girl,
But then fun is second best

No one's gonna tie me down
Nobody tell me what to do
Don't you see I've got to be free
Sorry baby, that's the way it is, get with me

I said maybe
I didn't mean to break your heart
And I know it's not your choice
Better think of it this way
There's other fools to entice
That's right

Baby, baby, baby, baby
I've changed my address
I didn't mean to make you cry
But I know it's for the best

Baby, baby, baby, baby
I've changed my address
It's okay being in love girl
But then fun is second best

Baby, baby, baby, baby
I've changed my address
I didn't mean to make you cry
But I'm sure it's for the best

Baby, baby, baby, baby
I've changed my address
It's okay being in love girl
But then fun is second best
I said, it's okay being in love girl
But then fun is second best
