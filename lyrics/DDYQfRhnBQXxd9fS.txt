I give you one step over the line and then I'm gone
I give you one step over the line and then I'm gone
Meet down-town with my heart...
These people are poison and ...
I give you one step over the line and then I'm gone
I'm gone!

One step over the line and then I'm gone
One step over the line and then I'm gone
.my heart and don't talk to you
It's just a feeling that I want to
I take one step over the line and then I'm gone!

Love them away from ...
Can't say it's something I can love
You better die... something
That means ain't probably nothing!
