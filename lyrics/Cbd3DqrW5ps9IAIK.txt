Prove and disprove
Efficiency of prayer
Supposed to be harmless
Can never get enough

A three headed watchdog
This, my revelation
My only disease
A manifest of life

If I could reach through
Catch you
Make you understand
If I'm not dead enough for life
Am I alive enough for death?

If I could reach through
Catch you
Make you understand
If I'm not dead enough for life
Am I alive enough for death?

A gift from the unknown
Promises they gave us
Rejection of faith
An eye for this purpose

Emotional images
Drawn with a single line
Our methods are unsound
A life I cannot offer
I cannot offer

If I could reach through
Catch you
Make you understand
If I'm not dead enough for life
Am I alive enough for death?

If I could reach through
Catch you
Make you understand
If I'm not dead enough for life
Am I alive enough for death?

*instrumental bridge*

If I could reach through
Catch you
Make you understand
If I'm not dead enough for life
Am I alive enough for death?

If I could reach through
Catch you
Make you understand
If I'm not dead enough for life
Am I alive enough for death?
