Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too
With fears on my pillow
Under the unlucky Jew
All that trust, all that wishing
Is now rightly or wrongly missing
Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too

Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too
War wounds on my pillow
Under the unlucky Jew
The crucifix on the wall
Protects not much at all
Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too

Realistically there was no hope for me
Not even close, 'twas destiny
We are what we are, at least for today
But you and I lost our way
This dawn will be the one I lost
This dawn will be the one
I love last

Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too
Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too

Realistically there was no hope for me
Not even close, not destiny
We are what we are, at least for today
But you and I lost our way
This dawn will be the one I lost
This dawn will be the one
I love last
The one
I love last
Yes, the one
That I love last

Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too
With fears on my pillow
Under the unlucky Jew
The crucifix on the wall
Protects not much at all
Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too
The crucifix on the wall
Protects not much at all

Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too
Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too
Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too
Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too
Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too
Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too
Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too
Not only did I lose you
I lost myself too
