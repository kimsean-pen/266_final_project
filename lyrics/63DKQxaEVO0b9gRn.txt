You call me a dog well that's fair enough
'Cause it ain't no use to pretend you're wrong
When you call me out I can't hide anymore
I have no disguise you can't see through

Well you say it's bad luck to have fallen for me
Well what can I say to make it good for you
You wore me out like an old winter coat
Trying to be safe from the cold

Oh, but when it's my time
To throw the next stone
I'll call you beautiful if I call at all

You call me a dog, you tell me I'm low
'Cause I've slept on the floor
And out in the woods with the badgers and wolves
You threw me out 'cause I went digging for gold
And I came home with a handful of coal

But when it's my time
To throw the next stone
I'll call you beautiful if I call at all

And when it's my time
To call your bluff
I'll call you beautiful
Or leave it alone, yeah

You call me a dog, well that's fair enough
It doesn't bother me as long as you know
But bad luck will follow you if you keep me on a leash
And you drag me along

And when it's my time
To throw the next stone
I'll call you beautiful if I call at all, yeah

And when it's my time
To call your bluff
I'll call you beautiful
Or leave it alone, yeah

You call me a dog
