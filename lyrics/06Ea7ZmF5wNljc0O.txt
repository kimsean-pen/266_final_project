Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Life is this way
Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Everyday

When I go to sleep at night
I add up my day
Trying to recall the things I done
And debts I have to pay
For there is one thing that I know
What you reap is what you sow

Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Life is this way
Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Everyday

Brother, mind what you do
And how you treat your fellow man
If you're like me, you'd try to live
The very best you can
For if you spread good all around
You'd be able to sleep when the sun goes down

Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Life is this way
Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Everyday
