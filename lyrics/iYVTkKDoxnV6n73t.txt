I won't keep
All the hurt you gave to me
I'm scared of everyone I meet
I can tell your talk is cheap

You can't delete
All the names you've called me
I'm not even scared of these
I'm keeping secrets you can't see

On the hook
I touch without a second look
I'm keeping this far from you
Stories that won't come true

So don't start
And don't you start on me
Don't start
And don't you start on me
Don't start
And don't you start on me

I'm yet to see
All the things you saved for me
I'm not even scared of these
The hurt is something I don't need

On the hook
I touch without a second look
I'm keeping secrets far from you
Stories that won't come true

So don't start
Don't you start on me
Don't start
And don't you start on me
Don't start
Don't you start on me

So don't start
Don't you start on me
Don't start
Don't you start on me
Don't start
Don't you start on me

Is it still me that you love?
Is it still me that you love?
Is it still me that you love?
'Cause i'm not sure

To the arms you know you'll never go
With the chance to prove it's not a joke
And we drink to try to improve our mood
And we go to the places we never should

Is it still me that you love?
Is it still me that you love?
Is it still me that you love?
'Cause I'm not sure

I'm afraid to tell you when you're wrong
I'm afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I'm afraid to tell you when you're wrong
'Cause I'm not sure
