Eliminate the life decline
I've paid the masters with blood and hunger
And it's not for sale by any stretch
It's like religion without a Bible
And the dragon lives inside of my mouth
And it speaks in tongues, the word

Hellbound! In Fort Worth, Texas
Hellbound! Fort Worth

Snakes in southern flames
To bring the thunder: the great decider
Would you believe in this or the ash?
I do believe it and it's taking over
Accept (Accept)

Hellbound! In Fort Worth, Texas
Hellbound! Fort Worth

Born to a world so young and proud
But over your head hangs a black cloud
Grow your hair and crawl inside yourself cause there you cannot hide
Facing fears you'll overcome
And one of these years you know you've won
You've won
You've won!
