No tears for the creatures of the night
No tears
No tears for the creatures of the night
No tears

My eyes are dry
Goodbye
My eyes are dry
Goodbye

I feel so hollow I just don't understand
Nothing's turned out like I-- like I planned
My head's exploding
My mouth is dry
I can't help it if I've forgotten how to-- cry

No tears for the creatures of the night
No tears
Uh oh, oh no, uh oh, oh no, uh oh, oh no
No tears for the creatures of the night
Uh oh, oh no, uh oh, no tears
Uh oh, oh no, uh oh, oh no, uh oh

My eyes are dry
Goodbye
My eyes are dry
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
My eyes are dry
