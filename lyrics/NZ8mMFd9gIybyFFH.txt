Delight Of The Moon Is Burning Inside
Spiritless I Lay On Cryptic Stones
Mesmerising Snow Wait Silent Above Me
And My Yearn For Frost Grow Strongly.
I Am Demon

A Demon With A Shadowed Face
Entering To My Wintercoffin
Awaiting To See The Dawnless Realms
Staring Into A Ground Of Glass
A Perfect View I Could Failed
Into My Eyes
The Unsilent Storms In The North Abyss.
