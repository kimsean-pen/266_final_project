Hearts are worn in these dark ages
You're not alone in this story's pages
The light has fallen amongst the living and the dying
And I'll try to hold it in
Yeah I'll try to hold it in

The world's on fire
It's more than I can handle
Tap into the water
Try to bring my share
Try to bring more
More than I can handle
Bring it to the table
Bring what I am able

I watch the heavens but I find no calling
Something I can do to change what's coming
Stay close to me while the sky is falling
I don't wanna be left alone. don't wanna be alone

The world's on fire
It's more than I can handle
Tap into the water
Try to bring my share
Try to bring more
More than I can handle
Bring it to the table
Bring what I am able

Hearts break, hearts mend
Love still hurts
Visions clash, planes crash
Still there's talk of
Saving souls, still the cold
is closing in on us

We part the veil on our killer sun
Stray from the straight line on this short run
The more we take the less we become
The fortune of one man means less for some

The world's on fire
It's more than I can handle
Tap into the water
Try to bring my share
Try to bring more
More than I can handle
Bring it to the table
Bring what I am able
