Wish you'd say you hear me
Cause I'm screaming from a world away, a world away

How can anybody think they know who I am?
When I can count the only people I trust on one fucking hand
Still trying to put my finger on what keeps me coming back
Still trying to put my finger on what keeps me coming back

You wore me out and now I'm paper thin
It's been too long since this shit made sense
I wanna go back to where we began

Can't help but feel you crossed a line
Seems like I say that every time
Can't help but feel always in time
Wish I could say this was the last time

You wore me out and now I'm paper thin
It's been too long since this shit made sense
I wanna go back to where we began

Wish you'd say you hear me
Cause I'm screaming from a world away, a world away

How much longer can I hold my breath?
My face is fading blue, a few missed calls from death
How much longer can I bite my tongue?
Sinking escape with nowhere to run

How much longer can I just be halfway?
'Til I'm breaking down, fall apart for you

How can anybody think they know who I am?
When I can count the only people I trust on one fucking hand
Still trying to put my finger on what keeps me coming back

You wore me out and now I'm paper thin
It's been too long since this shit made sense
I wanna go back to where we began

Wish you'd say you hear me
Cause I'm screaming from a world away, a world away
