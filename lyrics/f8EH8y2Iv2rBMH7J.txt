You said that you'd rather
Spend your time with another
The hearts of my brothers are on the floor.

I bet you wish that you bothered
When this band gets discovered
Don't worry yeah we recovered

And this one's for you.

We could be way up
We could be on top
If it weren't for shit like you.
We could be way up
We could be on top
If it weren't for shit like you
And oh ah oooh
Oh ah oooooh
Oh ah oooooh
If it weren't for shit like you.
When you're in your car with your driver
You'll hear how we blew up like a bonfire
God knows we're survivors
We won't stop until we get more
I bet you wish that you bothered
When this band gets uncovered
Don't worry yeah we recovered
And this one's for you.
We could be way up
We could be on top
If it weren't for shit like you.
We could be way up
We could be on top
If it weren't for shit like you
And oh ah oooh
Oh ah oooooh
Oh ah oooooh
If it weren't for shit like you.
Oh ah oooooh
Oh ah oooooh
Oh ah oooooh
If it weren't for shit like you.
We could be way up
If it weren't for shit like you.
We could be way up
If it weren't for shit like you.
Oh
We could be way up
We could be on top
If it weren't for shit like you.
We could be way up

If it weren't for shit like you
Oh ah oooooh

If it weren't for shit like you.
