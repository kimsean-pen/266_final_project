I am just a new boy
Stranger in this town.
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?

Ooooh, I need a dirty woman.

Ooooh, I need a dirty girl.
Will some woman in this desert land.
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock and roll refugee

Oooh, babe set me free.
Ooooh, I need a dirty woman.
Ooooh, I need a dirty girl.
Ooooh, I need a dirty woman.
Ooooh, I need a dirty girl.
