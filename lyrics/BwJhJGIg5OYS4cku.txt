The breeze in the nighttime would kill you stone dead
It was a message I heard when the company said
There is no warning and there is no future
I like the way they treat me, but I hate the way they use her
I hate the way they use her

I never really ever spent the day in bed
And my hair was red and my eyes weren't dead
I was a cool, cool kid on the kerbstone scene
And the lights in my eyes, they were evergreen
Like you never seen

The breeze in the nighttime would kill you stone dead
It was a message I heard when the company said
There is no warning and there is no future
I like the way they treat me but I hate the way they use her
I hate the way they use

Well I never really ever spent the day in bed
And my hair was red and my eyes weren't dead
I was a cool, cool kid on the kerbstone scene
And the lights in my eyes, they were evergreen
Just you've never seen before

It's said the breeze in the nighttime would kill you stone dead
It was a message I heard when the company said
There is no warning, there's no future
I like the way they treat me, but I hate the way they use her
I hate the way they use
