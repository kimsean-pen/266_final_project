Daddy DJ, please take me to the party
And let me dance along,
until the lights are on

You leave me once again home alone
The fridge is full but my heart is achin'
You think I can make it on my own
Just a kiss and you are gone
Another night like a million before
Another party where I'm not invited
As always you'll heat the dance floor
In front of your turntables going mad
Why don't you keep me close to you

I'm not anymore the kid you knew
Why should I stay deep in the blue
I wanna move my body too

{Refrain:}
Daddy DJ, please take me to the party
And let me dance along, until the lights are on
Daddy DJ, please take me to the party
And let the music play, until the break of day

We've been aside since I meant to be
A part of you that was just awaking
My life with you is a fantasy
I am your prince and you are my king
You say your thing drives sometimes you insane
You think you're no good father and so you're ashamed
But all I want is to share your pain
Clubbin' the night along and having fun
Why don't you keep me close to you
I'm not anymore the kid you knew
I wanna feel this part of youI wanna move my body too

Daddy DJ, please take me to the party
And let me dance along, until the lights are on
