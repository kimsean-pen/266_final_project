Since you're so curious, well it's anything
really. Call it my witching hour or what calls
to me. But to be serious, it's worse than you
think. Should I be ashamed because of what
I need? Define right and wrong in regard to
what's going on. Take two, slip away till the
afternoon. It's an easy remedy for what I just
can't do. Over the counter and over the moon.
I have my beliefs this has me confused, but
what can I do? I feel relief in just watching
you breathe. It's hypnotizing like an inner
peace. I get fixated on your deepest breaths
waiting for the angels to take their effect.
