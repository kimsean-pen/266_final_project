You make me feel real good
But it's too good to be true
Sometimes I feel I'm losin my mind
Cuz everything I'm feelin all depends on you
You make me feel better
Then you turn to bring me down
Got me running to keep ya
Know I should leave ya
That makes you the illest thing around
Oh, u got me right
Oh, it feels so right
Still I'm feelin like
I hate to love you
It's like you got me on a roller-coaster
I wanna get off
But I ain't supposed to
I hate to love you
I do
I hate to love u
You're treatin me real bad
And it works everytime
Just when I think about leavin you
Switchin up it's like you read my mind
And I should know better
Cuz even when I say I'm thorugh
At the end of the day
No matter what I say
You know that I'm runnin back to you
Oh, u got me right

Oh, it feels so right
Still I'm feelin like
I hate to love you
It's like you got me on a roller-coaster
I wanna get off
But I ain't supposed to
I hate to love you
I do
I hate to love you
And babe I don't know what you're doin
But oh you got me got me got me spinnin
I can't get over you
Oh, u got me right
Oh, it feels so right
Still I'm feelin like
I hate to love you
It's like you got me on a roller-coaster
I wanna get off
But I ain't supposed to
I hate to love you
I do
Oh, u got me right
Oh, it feels so right
Still I'm feelin like
I hate to love you
It's like you got me on a roller-coaster
I wanna get off
But I ain't supposed to
I hate to love you
I do
I hate to love you
