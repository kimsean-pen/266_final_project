Maybe we can talk all night,
but that ain't getting us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can,
there's nothin' left inside of here
And maybe you can cry all night,
but that'll never change the way that I feel
The snow is really piling up outside,
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here
I poured it on and I poured it out,
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long,
I'm cryin' icicles instead of tears
And all I can do, is keep on tellin' you
I want you (I want you),
I need you (I need you)
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad (don't be sad 'cause)'
Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad, ('cause)
'cause two out of three ain't bad
You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
I know you're lookin' for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
But there ain't no Coupe de Ville hidin' at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box
I can't lie (I can't lie...)
I can't tell you that I'm somethin' I'm not
No matter how I try, I'll never be able
To give you somethin', somethin' that I just haven't got (woh-oh)
Well there's only one girl that I will ever love
And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back, ooh-ooh I know
Well I remember how she left me on a stormy night
Ahh, she kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away
And she kept on tellin' me,
She kept on tellin' me,
She kept on tellin' me
I want you (I want you)
I need you (I need you)
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad (don't be sad, cause)
Cause two out of three ain't bad
I want you (I want you)
I need you (I need you)
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad (don't be sad, cause)
Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad
Cause two out of three ain't bad
Maybe we can talk all night
But that ain't getting us nowhere
