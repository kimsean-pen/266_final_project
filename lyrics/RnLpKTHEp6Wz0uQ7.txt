When I was a latchkey kid in the Luna
A free-from-gult born baby boomer
Can you pick me up a little bit sooner
I'm waiting all day, all day

When I wasting my days at the lido
I was picking my teeth with a log
I was keeping it cool with cry, ah
Waiting all day, all day

Agitator, extricater, won't you come evacuator?
Infiltrator, hesitater, won't you come emancipator?

A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of

When I was a Kung-Fu kid on the Luna
I was moonin' at the Bella Luna
Trump clogging up my computer
But I'm watching all day, all day

They say that heaven is other people
But the other side is cool for evil
Please don't let their be a sequel
Coz I'm watching all day, all day

Agitator, extricater, won't you come evacuator?
Infiltrator, hesitater, won't you come emancipator?

A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of

We had it all but we didn't stop to think about it
We had it all but we didn't stop to think about it
I've had a wild one, I've had a wild one

A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of

When I was a Kung-Fu kid on the Luna
I was moonin' at the Bella Luna
Trump clogging up my computer
But I'm watching all day, all day
