I'll Be True To You (Yes, I Will)
I'll be true to you, yes I will.
I'll be true to you, yes I will.
I won't look twice when the other girls go by.
I'll be true to you, yes I will.

Somehow this time it's all so clear to me.
The way to go is easy to see.
My heart is sure you're the girl I've waited for.
And I'll be true to you, yes I will.

I used to be the kind,
Who said that ev'ry girl's the say
And love was just a game for having fun,
But when I looked at you,
I knew that I was wrong
And that I really could belong to only one.

I'll be true to you, yes I will.
Ev'ry dream that you have, I'll fulfill.
I never promised this to anyone before
But I'll be true to you, yes I will.
Yes, I'll be true to you, yes I will.
