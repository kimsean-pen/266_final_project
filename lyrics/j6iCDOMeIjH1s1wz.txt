Turn the airport to a shooting range, let my nuts hang
Big pistol with a dick in it, tell me what you claim
Fuck the fame, I'ma rape the game
Keep on slanging 'caine, 'til the cop come
What's the outcome, just somebody slain
Laying on the couch with some oxys and a fat bitch
You thinking she bad, but to me she kinda average
All these rappers lame as fuck, all your hoes been acting up
I'm chopping up some product for ya bitch, you bet I serve a cut

Don't get it confused, pop the fuse then it's time to dip
Allah Akbar, Jihad when I hit a lick
Been a fiend since Burt, beer goggles, views from the 5th
Choppers rain heavy down in Mexico, let it rip
Stick shift swerving, I'm way even out in ATL
They calling me the goat, all I know is how to give 'em Hell
Shake been doing well, can't you tell how I play with words
Now you mad as fuck cause the dragon came and pulled your girl
I ain't just a dragon, call me Moses how I water whip
Rap made me a monster, I'm a product so I gotta flip
All these loose lips, sink ship but they sucking dick
Ain't no problem with 'em long as I don't get a fucking jit

Two perkys and a xan, that's a sleeping bag
I got two bad bitches in my sleeping bag
Finna suck me up, told her best let me go smash
Boy don't test your luck, turn the venue to a boxing match
