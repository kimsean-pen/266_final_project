What's this useful optimism
Empty headed kids are bad
God I'm feeling I got a hunger
I love my soul I'm satisfied

Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator

Living on to be a sinner
Lord it's hard to be a saint
Had a sister, had a grandma
It's bad to show I can't let you in

Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on

Here we come, we're coming fast
Out the upside into the past
Forced to screaming in my head
Into the future, into the future

Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator

Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator

Come on
