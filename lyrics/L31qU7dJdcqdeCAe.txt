I wanna be your enemy
I wanna be your friend
I wanna give you everything
Then take it back again

Let me run to you
Let me break down your walls
Let me melt into you
'Til there's nothing left at all

Grab me, take me, love me all the way
Wake me, chase me, embrace me all the way

Don't half love me, love me all the way
Don't you half love me, love me all the way
Don't half love me, love me all the way
Love me all the way, love me all the way
Love, love, love, love me all the way

I'm running out of patience
It's getting hard to cope
I'm screaming out for silence
I'm running out of rope

Let me get to you
I need some wind in my sails
I would crawl to you
With blood under my nails, yeah

Grab me, take me, love me all the way
Wake me, chase me, embrace me all the way

Don't half love me, love me all the way
Don't you half love me, love me all the way (don't!)
Don't half love me, love me all the way
Love me all the way, love me all the way
Love, love, love, love me all the way

I'll take the first step, I don't care
Follow your heart, I'll meet you there
We'll make a circle, stop and stare
Right through the dark
Don't

Don't half love me, love me all the way
Don't you half love me, love me all the way (don't!)
Don't half love me, love me all the way
Love me all the way, love me all the way
Love, love, love, love me all the way

Don't half love me
Love, love, love me all the way
