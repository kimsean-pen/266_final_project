Always so distant.
Hiding from the sun.
He is looking around her,
To find where she is not.

The archway of Heaven,
The saints of the Earth,
Old parts from her broken ribs.
Now she is enthroned
On the spaceless void.
She is breathing fire as a dragon
And we all feel the heat.
Her touch is soft as the wind.

Faceless Queen
A mask your only skin
Faceless queen
Faceless queen,
Can you remove,
Your mask of skin?

She is enigma,
A canvas without frame.
Worshiped as Goddess
By the toys she made from clay.
Behold the Faceless Queen!
Behold the Faceless Queen!

Her realm extends to the endless sea
And she rules from the spaceless void.
She is breathing fire as a dragon
And we all feel the heat.
Her touch is soft as the wind.

Faceless Queen
A mask your only skin
Faceless queen
Faceless queen,
Can you remove,
Your mask of skin?

The serpent with the golden crown,
Faceless staring at the sun.
The serpent sits upon its throne,
Faceless staring at the sun.

Always so distant.
Hiding from the sun.
He is looking around her,
To find where she is not.

Behold the Faceless Queen!
Behold the Faceless Queen!
