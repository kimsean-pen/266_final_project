[Thurston]
a hundred dollars used to be more than enough
and now a hundred times a day and still it's not enough
people always tell me you get what you deserve
all I know is all and all is all I've heard

I heard you say: "you know I hate myself
but I love everybody else"
and did you say: "I can't escape myself"
and then you did and now there's no one else

to blame you know that I know yeah that times are rough
I'd like to help you out but things are rather tough
people always tell me that you've got to lend a helping hand
nothing in return is all I expect from you my friend

I heard you say: "you know I hate myself
but I love everybody else"
and did you say: "I can't escape myself"
and then you did and now there's no one else

I heard you say: "you know I hate myself
but I love everybody else"
and did you say: "I can't escape myself"
and then you do and now there's no one else
