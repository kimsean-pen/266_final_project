You're a star that will never go out
Wherever you go on your way home
you can see the sun
Don't be afraid that you'll burn out your glow
Because you shy know that we stem free in the fading snow
You stay alive in the cold, in the rain
(yeah)
You stay alive
in the cold (in the cold)
in the rain (in the rain)
You stay alive
know that you see that
Don't waste your time thinking
you are done for
Whenever you're alone just hang on to
your burning force
Turn on your lights if your purpose get lost
Because you got me and the whole life
forever more
You stay alive in the cold, in the rain
(yeah)
You stay alive, in the cold (in the cold),
in the rain (in the rain)
You stay alive
Know that you see it
(know that you see it)
If we go home we will be alright
We need to get home so we can see starlight (starlight)
You stay alive, in the cold (in the cold)
in the rain (in the rain)
You stay alive, in the cold (in the cold)
in the rain (in the rain)
Know that you see it
If we go home we will be alright (Yeah)
