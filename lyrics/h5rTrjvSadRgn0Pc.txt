Right here I'd like to melt inside of you
Right here you kiss is totally new
Right here your hands are soft and creamy
Right here your mouth is wet and dreamy

And it's just what I like
So dim down the light
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)
If it makes you feel good
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)

(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)

Your rhapsody is blowing my cool-ool
Your fantasies there written for fools

Your long black hair tickles my skin skin
It feels so luscious come on do it again, oh yeah

And it's just what I like
Dim down the light
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)
If it makes you feel good
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)
If it makes you feel good
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)

If it makes you feel good, good,
Good, good, good
Don't cha stop don't cha stop

A don't cha stop if it makes you feel
Good, good, good
Ooh don't cha stop don't cha stop
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)
Don't you stop don't cha stop
If it makes you feel
Good, good, good
Good, good, good
Good, good, good
Don't cha stop
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)
(Don't cha stop don't cha stop)
