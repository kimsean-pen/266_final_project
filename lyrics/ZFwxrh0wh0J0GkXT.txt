I got close
To your skin
While you were sleeping
I taste the
Salt on
Your hands
I reached out
To touch you
The morning light disarms you
Won't you let me
In?
Ohhhhhhh
How long till your surrender?
Ohhhhhhh
How long till your
Surrender?
It's a long way
For heart break
Let your heart wait and bleed
Ohhhhhhh

How long till your surrender to me?
I've become your shadow
I'd love, but don't know
How to
I'm always lost for words
You look like a thousand suns
I wanna be the only one

Left when your day is done
I can't have you close
So I become a ghost

And I watch you

I watch you
Maybe if you stay
We could die this way
But I won't stop you
I won't stop you
