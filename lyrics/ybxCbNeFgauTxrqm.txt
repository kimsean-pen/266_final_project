The first degree was a riot
You were making sure my lesson's learned
I'm not ashamed but I'm trying
I've come to expect the standards you have set

Tell me just how dangerous is second best
You've settled for less and I'm sure you'll settle again

There's no stopping me, I'm gutting you out
Does this make you feel safe?
There's no stopping this, I'm gutting you out
Does this make you feel safe?

The closer I look is just the further that you get
Already stubborn skin thickens
In attempt to understand, understand

There's no stopping me, I'm gutting you out
Does this make you feel safe?
There's no stopping this, I'm gutting you out
Does this make you feel safe?

I got tired of waiting when
The guilt subsides, the night begins
And I know it's not what you deserve

Came as a gift from a good friend that disapproves but understands
That you represent and actively encourage all of my worst habits
They all are proof that we're both capable of the most terrible things
Don't test me

There's no stopping this, I'm gutting you out
Does this make you feel safe?
There's no stopping this, I'm gutting you out
Does this make you feel safe?

I got tired of waiting when
The guilt subsides, the night begins
And I know it's not what you deserve

You got tired of waiting when
The guilt subsides, the night begins
And I know it's not what you deserve

You're silent for good
You're silent for good

I know it's not what you deserve
It's not what you deserve
I know it's not what you deserve
I know it's not what you deserve
