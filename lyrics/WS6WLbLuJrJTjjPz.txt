With benediction in her eyes,
Our dearest gods are not surprised.
You better hold your lover down,
Tie him to the ground.
Whisper "I love you,"
One thousand times into his ear, kiss his eyes,
And don't you cry girl, he won't disappear.
But I know better than to let you down.

With benediction in her mind,
She'll never get you back in time.
You better hold your lover down,
And tie her to the ground.
Simple pleasures strike like lighting,
Scratches spell her name.
Thunder demons swipe her halo,
And then they run away.

But I know better than to let her go.

With benediction in her eyes,
Our dearest gods are not surprised.
You better hold your lover down,
And tie her to the ground.
Simple pleasures strike like lightening,
Scratches cross her name.
Whisper "I love you my darling, life is just a fling."
But I know better than to let her go.

I know better that to let you go.
I know better than to her go.
I know better than to let you go.

I know better.
I know better.
I know better.
