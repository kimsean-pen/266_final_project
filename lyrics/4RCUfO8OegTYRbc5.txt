Trampled by the asphyxiating density
Birth ritual gone through the undercurrent
So high on the ammonia and metallic hydrogen
This drevicet out of reach

Null inhabitant
One with the cyclone vortex
Dropped below the blankness
The sunlight fiction

Weirdness in gravity
Rotating till the end of cycle
Nourish of light the bizarre chamber

The approaching roar
Dissolving the mundane wrapped being
