The Ship was from the willing land
The waves about it roll

And as aglow by powder band
We lift, we loot, we haul

The tie is still
The sky is young
Roll on towards the goal
And we are at the undescribed
To take a new control

For word a lure a prayful being
The bad the cast away
My never did the greater band
My life with you is dead

So soothe the stones that dealt the tie
The piper plays the wind
But we are at the undefined
Reeking of the wing
When pray with time at memory day
And pray the tie told
The sail is down the wind is gone
The sky is blessed with growth
The slave to host a pistody
Illusion of control
And we are as the unrefined
The wake about to roll

(Background female voice talking)

Can I take the freedom and forget you
How can it, form contractions
Don't talk that I'm frightened
Do I know exactly my husband
That I Love You. We miss you, after that
Go get brethren (grab her then)
I still act

Intermixed by different men voices interjecting words

Go about it, A song
Another ghost, by himself, I like that
you are too polite
Cup
The thing
Hello
-No wait!-
Times
Come back
A man
Chance
In twos
A timer
The sand
Imp
Glass
Funny
Way
Stretched
Light up
The vibration
Awe
That pearly
What a waste
Of help
As Wave
After Wave
After Wave
After Wave
After Wave
After Wave
After Wave
After Wave
After Wave
