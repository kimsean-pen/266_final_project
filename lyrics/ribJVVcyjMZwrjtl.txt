I don't like you, but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinkin' of you
Oh, oh, oh, you treat me badly, I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me (You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me (You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I don't want you, but I need you
Don't wanna kiss you, but I need to
Oh, oh, oh, you do me wrong now, my love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me (You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me (You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I love you and all I want you to do is just...
Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter, tighter

I wanna leave you, don't wanna stay here
Don't wanna spend another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I wanna split now, I can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me (You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me (You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I love you and all I want you to do is just...
Hold me (Please), hold me (Squeeze), hold me, hold me

You really got a hold on me (You really got a hold on me)
I said you really got a hold on me (I said you really got a hold on me)
You know, you really got a hold on me (You know, you really got a hold on me)
You know, you really got a hold on me (You know, you really got a hold on me)

I said you really got a hold on me (I said you really got a hold on me)
You know, you really got a hold on me (You know, you really got a hold...)
