The woeful silence
and wind's reflection
of your body's pale ode:
an icy fortress
of blood and ages.

Sky fire above, ice below the hearth.
Sky fire above, ice below the hearth.

Fall away from me
to that citadel
at the end of time
where death sleeps
and dreams of your buried pain.
There has never been a silence like this before.
There will never be an ode like this again.
