Fall of humanity, the rise of recognition
Controlled by vanity and self-obsession
Status, the new god
Worship the media whores
Sodomized for admiration and your attention

Leeches, penetrate and bleed you
Feces, full of shit they feed you

Greenhouse of sheep in production
Children, ground zero for destruction
Future leaders of enslaved stupidity
To detour the races from reality

Life is sacrificed all for the masochistic
For the corpses well preserved in fucking plastic
All hail the new church, built on false foundation
Feed your need for pure perfection and fear rejection

Rapists, left after they used you
Shameless, you just hope they choose you

Greenhouse of sheep in production
Children, ground zero for destruction
Future leaders of enslaved stupidity
To detour the races from reality

You will devour all false power

Reflections of chaos burn in your eyes
Witness the birth, legions of earth
And human demise
Reflections of chaos blacken the skies
Witness the curse burning the earth and all mankind
All mankind

Let the chaos burn the blind from your eyes
Bleeding out from inside, let it feed what you're denied
You will devour all with false power
