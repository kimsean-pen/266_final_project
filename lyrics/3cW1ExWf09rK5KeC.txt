Day after day I'm more confused
Yet I look for the light through the pourin' rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose
And I'm feeling the strain
Ah ain't it a shame
Oh, give me the beat boys, and free my soul

I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away
Give me the beat boys, and free my soul

I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away
Won't you take me away

Beginnin' to think that I'm wastin' time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
And I'm countin' on you
You can carry me through

Oh, give me the beat boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away

Give me the beat boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away

Won't you take me away
And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
When I'm feelin' blue

The guitar's coming through to soothe me
Thanks for the joy that you're givin' me
(ooh the joy that you're givin' me)
I want you to know I believe in your song
(oh yeah)

Rhythm and rhyme and harmony
(mmmm)
You help me along

(makin' me strong)
Ah you're makin' me strong
Oh, give me the beat boys, and free my soul

I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away
(drift away ooh)
Give me the beat boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away
(drift away)
Give me the beat boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away
(drift away oh)
Just give me the beat boys, and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll
And drift away
Yeah
Won't you take me
Won't you take me
I want to drift away
Won't you take me away
I want to drift away
I want to drift away
Take me home
Let me drift away
Won't you take me away
