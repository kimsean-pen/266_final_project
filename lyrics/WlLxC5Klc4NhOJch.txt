I'm a moon-walker
I'm like MJ up in the clouds
I know it sounds awkward
I'm filthy as charged, filthy as charged
You're a sweet talker
But, darlin', whatcha gonna say now?
The midnight marauders
The higher never come down, never come down

You can't take me anywhere, anywhere
You can't take me anywhere, anywhere
I'm still uninvited, I'm still gonna light it
I'm going insane and I don't care

(Whatever they tell you...)

Dancing, dancing, dancing's not a crime
Unless you do it without me
Unless you do it without me
Dancing, dancing, dancing's not a crime
Unless you do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it without me
Without me

And if you're night crawlin' with him
I won't take it lying down
I've got a few lawyers
And you're guilty as charged, guilty as charged
We could be waltzin', yeah
But darlin' don't be throwing shade now
Don't call me Saint California if you're at another altar
Just gimme your vows, gimme your vows, yeah

You can't take me anywhere, anywhere
You can't take me anywhere, anywhere
I'm still uninvited, I'm still gonna light it
I'm going insane and I don't care

(Whatever they tell you...)

Dancing, dancing, dancing's not a crime
Unless you do it without me
Unless you do it without me
Dancing, dancing, dancing's not a crime
Unless you do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it without me
Without me

Ooo, ooo, ooo, what's come over you
Baby, just tell me now
Ooo, ooo, ooo, won't we make that move
'Cause I just wanna be
And I just wanna be

(Whatever they tell you...)

Dancing, dancing, dancing's not a crime
Unless you do it without me
Unless you do it without me
Dancing, dancing, dancing's not a crime
Unless you do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it without me
Without me
Do it, do it, do it without me
Without me
Without me
Without me
