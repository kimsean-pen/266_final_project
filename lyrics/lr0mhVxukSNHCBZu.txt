It's a tedious existence laying your love on the line
Resistance is useless she can leave at any time
I must confess that in my quest I felt depressed and restless
But this casanova's roving days are over more or less

With love, with love
With love, with love

She broke my heart and made me sad
She broke my heart and made me sad
She broke my heart
You foolish boy, you lost what you had

With love
She says she won't be back no more
With love
Oh, she says goodbye

My mademoiselle I must make my farewell
You see Se√±or, I know she don't want me no more
I'd like to make that Fraulein mine, mein Fraulein
So I'll depart, my sweetheart, leave you with this line

With love
She says she won't be back no more
With love
She says she's leaving for sure

My mademoiselle, I'll say farewell
No matter where you are, au revoir
'Til we meet again, Auf Wiedersehn

She wrote it on a letter
But it didn't make him feel any better
With love, with love
She says goodbye, adios, farewell

With love
With love
With love
