Idlest delilah
Darling, do ya like beige in your coffee, tea, a wild-?
Wild breeze on a day, a dawn
Oft' indeed a child, smiles at me cause I'm made of yarn
Dolly me, am I? I'll trade a dollar for ya dime! Oh
Idlest delilah, trout and trees, remind me of my
Darling "D The diver"
Diver D was a saytr - a
Father figurine, I made him run away with his stale lung
Folly me am I? Oh, Idol-less Delilah...
Darling Miss Delilah
While you're wasting your days alone
All your friends are hired
All your friendships are fading
Don't try to cheat the dye
Don't look the other way
It could play out wrong
Are you suicidal?
Are you in denial?
Idlest Delilah
While you're 'wake hear my latest song
Glad to see you smile
Glad to see you so stable...
What's all of these divided by the pile of peas on the nape of your...?
Dolly me am I? I'll trade a dollar for your dime
I'll take you

Slick snapper, soul clap on 3!
Hi-hatter, the dip-dapper pretty pat this "p"
Tip-tapper, the chit-chatter, ready rap AB
Can't deal with the bullshit, cause the crab ain't me
He took you to cruise trips, put a yacht on me
He said, the puss deeper than the deep blue sea
Indeed, the puss deeper than the three fugees...

Applauded the favorite, so clap on 3
