Water Meadowland and Small Shot For the Ducks
He Walks in the Mud, Moves Aside the Reeds
No Clapping of Wings, no Motions Around.
Just the Singing Wind in An Ominous Silence.

Revealed, Underlined in a Sudden Gust of Wind
The Profile of a Man Raises Under the Moon
Uncovered and Tiny, Overlooking the Fen

Said a Man of Poise With a Drawling Voice

The Fen Is Awakened and Follows the Steps
