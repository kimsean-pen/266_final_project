I'm a kickstand in your mouth
And I'm the tongue slamming on the brakes
Pull the choke in, pull the choke in
As hard as it will take

All your pictures are getting dirty
Don't want anyone else's hand on my gears
And I'll choke on all the diamonds
Like a vulture on your face

So ask your self before you get in
Know the insurance won't cover this
Are you the rabbit or the headlight
And is there room in your life
For one more breakdown?

You can't escape, can't escape
All your demons, all your demons
Watch out, watch out for your lovers

Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Faster, I'm late, I'm late
And the hands on my clock
Are starting to shake

We're on the line between the Devil's tits
We've been driving on E
I'm gonna be wanted for this crime
"Well, at least you're wanted," she'll say

So ask your self before you get in
Know the insurance won't cover this
Are you the rabbit or the headlight
And is there room in your life
For one more breakdown?

You are an unmarked car
Can't remember where I parked you
But I love you, can't afford you
Take a cab to the funeral

Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Faster, I'm late, I'm late
And the hands on my clock
Are starting to shake

You can't escape, can't escape
All your demons, all you demons
Watch out, watch out for your lovers

So ask your self before you get in
Know the insurance won't cover this
Are you the rabbit or the headlight
And is there room in your life
For one more breakdown?
