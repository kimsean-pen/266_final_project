I understand why you're looking for tears in my eyes
Trust me they were there but now the well has dried
I was in so deep but couldn't get out
I sat on feelings that I buried deep down
I knew there come a day when our paths would cross
And I'm glad it's today cos now I am strong

I'm happy and I can thank myself
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed crying
I'm happy and I know that makes you sad
After all the things you put me through
I'm finally getting over you
I'm happy, I'm happy

There's a reason why we met and I'm glad that we did
But when we broke up, I got back a part of me I really missed
Not saying that you brought me down all the time
There were moments I lived without lying on my side

I'm happy and I can thank myself
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed crying
I'm happy and I know that makes you sad
After all the things you put me through
I'm finally getting over you

All the bitterness has passed
And I only wish you someone who can do what I can't

I'm happy and I can thank myself
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed crying
I'm happy and I know that makes you sad
After all the things you put me through
I'm finally getting over you

I'm happy and I can thank myself
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed crying
I'm happy and I know that makes you sad
After all the things you put me through
I'm finally getting over you
I'm happy, I'm happy
