one day I was
walking down the street
somebody said to me
and told me I was

just like
somebody in his dream
he said that it may seem
all kinds of rude but

somebody once had told me
if your mind goes where it's been
we will give into another
and just call the rest a sin

where did you go
where did you go
where didi you go

I am lonely
where did you go
its getting harder to tread light

so I crash
in to it
the truth heats the sea
of my ask
to see ya
and set myself free

so I crash
in to you
to let this all go
so I crash into you
(I crash into you)

one day I
walked along a road
the markers seemed to show
that it would lead me

to where
I knew that you would go
they said that I would sow
all that I'm reaping

somebody once had told me
if your mind goes where it's been
we will give into another
and just call the rest a sin

where did you go
where did you go
where didi you go

I am lonely
where did you go
its getting harder to tread light

so I crash
in to it
the truth heats the sea
of my ask
to see ya
and set myself free

so I crash
in to you
to let this all go
so I crash into you
(I crash into you)
