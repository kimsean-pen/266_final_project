Fuck me, like you mean it
Make me worship you, I'm a believer
Come, erase the static in my head, pull me close to your chest
Like a secret you kept in the dark
Break me into pieces
Take away the breath I'm barely breathing
I can feel you running through my blood, the adrenaline rush
Hits my heart like a drug, lift me up

Make me feel like it's better than life
Make me feel like it's better than life

How can I be strong?
You know all the weaknesses I got
Come and fill the spaces in my thoughts, are you ready or not?
Bring me down on my knees with your cross

Make me feel like it's better than life
Make me feel like it's better than life

It's better than life
It's better than life

Make me feel like it's better than life
Make me feel like it's better than life

It's better than life
It's better than life

It's better than life
