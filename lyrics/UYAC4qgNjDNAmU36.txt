been gone way too long
try and beat doubt
when I hold you
lift a little
thats all I know right now
pray for a minute that i dont get it wrong
feel more with it than i want
more with it than i want

don't know where you are
just backgrounds floating
next one isn't far
keep tight to many people

don't know where you are
just backgrounds floating
next one isn't far
keep tight to many people

thats when it takes you apart
something soon enough
where another thing was
thats all youve got right now
hold for a miracle
you might get one
too far in to be undone
too far in to be undone

don't know where you are
just backgrounds floating
next one isn't far
keep tight to many people
