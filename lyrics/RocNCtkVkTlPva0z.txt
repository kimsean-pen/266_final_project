Feels like I can't forget
Every time I try to love again
'Cause I've protect the versus game
'Cause I'm with you
I'm still with you
'Cause I'm with you
Yeah, I'm with you
I am with you
Yeah, I'm with you

Feels like what everybody's searching for
Is someone who'll always keep them wanting more
How many more times can be a [?]
Fell in love once, forever keep on looking back
Forever keep on looking back

And I'm without regrets
Baby, I can't give myself again
Put out the flame, and let the rain
I will miss you
Yeah, I'll miss you

Feels like what everybody's searching for
Is someone who'll always keep them wanting more
How many more times can be a [?]
Fell in love once, forever keep on looking back
Looking, forever keep on looking back
Looking, looking
