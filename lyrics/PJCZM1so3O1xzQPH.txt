You know I never meant to see you again
But I only passed by as a friend, yeah

All this time I stayed out of sight
I started wondering why
Now I, ooh now I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooh yes I wish it would rain, down on me
Ooh yes I wish it would rain on me

You said you didn't need me in your life
Oh I guess you were right, yeah
Ooh I never meant to cause you no pain
But it looks like I did it again yeah

Now I, now I know I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooh girl I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh yes I wish it would rain on me

Though your hurt is gone, mines hanging on, inside and I know well it's eating me through, it's eating me through now yeah
I'm just waiting on your sign

'Cause I know, I know I never meant to cause you no pain
And I realize I let you down oh yeah
But I know in my heart of heart of hearts
I know I'm never gonna hold you again
Nooo
Now I, now I know I wish it would rain down, down on me
Whoa you know I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooh yes I wish it would rain, down on me
Yes you know I wish it would rain down, rain down over me
Just rain down on me
Just let rain down let it rain down
let it rain down ooh yeah
let it rain down rain rain down over me
Just let it rain down just let it rain down
Let it rain down just let it rain
