When she laughs
The piano in the hall
Plays a quiet note

Waterfalls
Turning gentle into rough
Then gentle again

Morning dew
Washes yesterday's garden
Ready for today

Rocking chair
Is still without a rocker
But is still a chair

When she laughs
The piano in the hall
Resonates a note.

Waterfalls
Turning gentle into rough
Then gentle again

Morning dew
Washes yesterday's garden
Ready for today

Rocking Chair
Is still without a rocker
But is still a chair

When she laughs
The piano in the hall
Plays a quiet note
