Stumbling around with my thorn of crowns.
King of clich√©d songs.
King of 'Lost and Found.' Water Hill swirling above me. "
Go to sleep son, don't be ugly." White hot moon, why don't you love me? "
You'll feel better in the morning." Wire dog, be my companion. "
Leave him be, he has no master." Wire dog's a good boy.
We'll run together.
We'll blend together.
We'll run together, but we won't stay.
Black mold grows so nice and easy. "
I will creep inside your body." Left the shower on all evening. "
Inundate the air you're breathing." Black mold, keep me company. "
I will never let you leave." I am not.
a good boy.
We'll run together.
We'll blend together.
We'll run together, but we won't stay.
