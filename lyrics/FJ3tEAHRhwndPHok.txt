Come and turn it up
You're gonna get that gold
I see it in your eyes
More than your hands can hold

There's something that you know
Don't matter where you go
Baby tell me when it's over, cause we can never lose
Go on and light it up
And let me see you do your thing like you were born again

Free, love is free, love is free
Come on and give it away
Come on and give it away now
Free, love is free, love is free
Why don't you give it away?
Why don't you give it away?

Come and walk that walk
Across the seven seas
Come on and start this fire
Bigger than you and me

There's something that you know
Don't matter where you go
If you give it all away it's gonna come around
Don't get it all switched up
Baby just do your thing

Free, love is free, love is free
Come on and give it away
Why don't you give it away now?
Free, love is free, love is free
So try to give it away
Come on and give it away now

Take my hand and lead me on
Take my hand and lead me home
Take my hand and lead me away now, away now
Away now, away now, away now, away now

Free, love is free, love is free
Why don't you give it away?
Why don't you give it away? Say
Free, love is free, love is free
Why don't you give it away?
Come on and give it away

Take my hand and lead me on
(Free, love is free, love is free)
So take my hand and lead me on
(Free, love is free, love is free)
Take my hand and lead me away
(Free, love is free, love is free)
Why don't you give it away?
Come on and give it away now
