You say you wanna make me happy
That you've never loved like this before
I wanna believe the things you're saying
I'm just not sure if I'm capable

Cause everytime your phone rings, baby
I wonder who's on the other line, making you smile
And everytime your eyes drift, baby
I wonder who's on your mind
Is it Her?

You say I've got nothing to worry about
You say it's all in my mind
But if you needed it then, you might need it again
If it could happen once, it could happen twice
Right? You say you're in this thing for life
That you wanna marry me someday
Right?
But there's a change in how you touch me
Is it the everyday routine kicking in?
Or is it Her?

You say I've got nothing to worry about
You say it's all in my mind
But if you needed it then, you might need it again
If it could happen once, it could happen twice
Right? You say I've got nothing to worry about
You say it's all in my mind
But if you needed it then, you might need it again
If it could happen once, it could happen twice

(distorted)

Right...?
