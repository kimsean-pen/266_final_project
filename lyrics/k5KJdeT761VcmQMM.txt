Like a closing door, I'm slowly shutting down
Like a falling leaf, just waiting for the pound
Don't even bother, nothing can stop it
Tried my best, but I just can't help it

It will take a lifetime before I love again
You will see me die before I love again
Say my last goodbye
Say my last goodbye; Goodbye; Goodbye
Say my last goodbye; Goodbye; Goodbye

All the broken pieces' shattered all around me
They've been lying there since the day that you left me
My last chance to fight against her

Tried my best, but I can't break her

It will take a lifetime before I love again
You will see me die before I love again
Say my last goodbye
Say my last goodbye; Goodbye; Goodbye
Say my last goodbye; Goodbye; Goodbye

Say my last goodbye, goodbye
It will take a lifetime...
It will take a lifetime...
Before I love again
You will see me die before I love again
Say my last goodbye
Say my last goodbye; Goodbye; Goodbye
Say my last goodbye; Goodbye; Goodbye
Say my last goodbye yeah
Goodbye
