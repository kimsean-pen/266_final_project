When I was just a kid they said
Kid don't you cry
I am older now I say
It's alright
Every tear rollin down is a lesson learned
Are you too old to turn
Are you too young to burn
Too young

Too young to burn
Too young too young
Too young to burn
Too young too young

Now i sit by my window
Watch the sun goin down down
And i see all the people
Walkin around and round
Every tear rollin down
Is a lesson learned
Are you too old to turn
Are you too young to burn
Too young

Too young to burn
Too young too young
Too young to burn
Too young too young

Too young to burn
Too young too young
Too young to burn
Too young too young
