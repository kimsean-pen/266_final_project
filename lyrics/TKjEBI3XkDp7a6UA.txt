Explain yourself

There's hope for God
There's hope for all sinners
There's hope for man
There's hope for our religions

But it must've been a good love
Singing to make you know

You see it
You want it
You love it
You got it
Nothing can take you from all that was ruined
Anything now, anything you feel

You got that, you got that loving
But it must've been a good love, singing the way, the way

You plead, you plead
You won't let love to be
What you mean in a beautiful world
You plead, you plead
You won't let love see a - another day

I'm not trying to say what you understand
I kinda had a feeling about us, and
I'm not trying to say anything
I kinda had a feeling about all of this
All of this
All of this and you

But it must've been a good love
Singing the way, the way

You plead, you plead
You won't let love to be
What you mean in a beautiful world
You plead, you plead
You won't let love see a - another day, another day

Having a conversation won't mean I'll try
It still makes no sense for the words in my lines
Having a conversation, but I don't understand, man
It's just a matter of English, but I abuse it instead
'Cause blue was for everything that I've crossed
And I know there are reasons for everything that I've done
But there is one thing I know, I know this fear
Love is like a dime, but a - not a fee

'Cause blue was the beautiful you
Blue was the beautiful you
Blue was the beautiful you
Blue was the beautiful you

It's time you say goodbye to me

Blue, blue

You plead, you plead
You won't let love to be
What you mean in a beautiful world
You plead, you plead
You won't let love see a - another day, another day
