among deep green hills
two eyes get lost in forests
crystal flower images slip
among the trunks of the trees
visions appear from the ground
shades without roots but still exist

strange animals
an eternal vital chain
monstrous pre-historic
a level of unearthly power
but still...
everything flows

some kind of a magic scar
everything gets harmonized
with the move of light

quick move of image
impossible to stay untouched
material follows the equilibrium
quickly release the earthly flesh
