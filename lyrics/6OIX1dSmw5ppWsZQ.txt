You don't know where I'm coming from
And all the faces look the same
And all the people have come and gone
Can you remember anybody's name?

My eyes are always open to what I wanna see
I'm trying not to close them
Oh, I'm not who I used to be

If you sing, then I sing
You've got my heartbeat racing
When you're gone, I'm crazy
I need you to stay with me
I can't sleep when you're gone
You're all I need
I need someone
And I won't sing 'til you say you're with me

You never know where I'm coming from
And the parties move the same
And all the words that I should've known
If you would only let me explain

Your eyes are always open to what you wanna see
You're trying not to close them
Oh, you're not who you used to be

If you sing, then I sing
You've got my heartbeat racing
When you're gone, I'm crazy
I need you to stay with me
I can't sleep when you're gone
You're all I need
I need someone
And I won't sing 'til you say you're with me

My eyes are always open to what I wanna see
I'm trying not to close them
Oh, I'm not who I used to be

If you sing, then I sing
You've got my heartbeat racing
When you're gone, I'm crazy
I need you to stay with me
I can't sleep when you're gone
You're all I need
I need someone
And I won't sing 'til you say you're with me
