The stars were bright, the moon was a vision
i enter the night on a white expedition
electricity, it fills the skies

a white sugar shimmer sparkles in my eyes
baby, it's all white
white like lightning in the sky

baby, it's all night
yeah, white icing all the time

white icing all the time
white icing all the time
white icing all the time (sugar on my mind)
all the things you said i couldn't find

well i think i found my silver line, well i live my fantasy all the time

suddenly i'm covered in light

and you know that it's real and i'm feelin'and i'm out for the night

baby, it's all white
white like lightning in the sky

baby, it's all night
yeah, white icing all the time

white icing all the time
white icing all the time
white icing all the time

all the snow you sold me
all the blow you told me i could do

you could show me lonely
i could show my only love to you

but the world's so white that it's hard to see
and the sun's so hot that it's burning me
so i hit the lights cuz' the dark is better
i pray for rain cuz' i like it wetter
pop a perk and enjoy the moment
when something hurts, you just gotta own it
pop a perk and enjoy the moment
when something's hurting you, you just gotta own it
all the time
white icing all the time
white icing all the time
the power
the lightning
white icing
