People ask if I'm in love with you
Because I'm sitting here with
Your picture and smiling to myself
I'm kinda lost in my own thoughts of you
My heart speaks before my mind thinks through
And I blush as I say, "Yes"

What a feeling of vulnerability coming over me
And I'm feeling weak and I can't speak and I can't think
Never thought I'd give in so willingly to a human being
With abilities to set me free and let me be me
Makes me want to say

Your lips, your eyes, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, believe me
Like a melody

Your soul, your flow, your youth
Your truth is simply proof we were meant to be
But the best quality that's hookin' me
Is that you're loving me for me, is that you're loving me for me

People ask why I'm in love with you
Well, let me start by saying
You got my heart by just being who you are
And what we got is between me and you
It doesn't matter about the money I make
Or what I do, or that I'm a, huh, a star

Unconditionally you're there for me
Undeniably you inspire me, spiritually, oh so sweet
This is meaningful, it's incredible, pleasurable, unforgettable
The way I feel, so so real
Makes me want to say

Your lips, your eyes, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, believe me
Like a melody

Your soul, your flow, your youth
Your truth is simply proof we were meant to be
But the best quality thats hookin' me
Is that you're loving me for me, is that you're loving me for me

It's so amazing how something so sweet
Has come and rearranged my life
I've been kissed by destiny
Oh, heaven came and saved me
An angel was placed at my feet
This isn't ordinary, he's loving me for me
Stripped of all make up, no need for fancy clothes
No cover ups, push ups, with him I don't have to put on a show
He loves every freckle, every curve, every inch of my skin
Fulfilling me entirely, taking all of me in
He's real, his honesty, he's loving me for me, yeah
