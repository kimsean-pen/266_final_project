Let this game begin
Watch, my children
Watch me
You've all come to die
For this battle is lost
Losing their minds
Losing their souls
Hush, now hush
We don't talk
We don't care anymore
(We don't care anymore)
I summon the Nine now
Confirm the alignment
Can I get through?
Carry on, you fools
Try to break free
When we fail
It's lost forever

When we fail
It's lost forever

It's not real, no reason to be here
No more fear and no more regrets
Don't look back and free your mind
Stay where you are till the sealing is over

Say goodbye, my friend
Here's your promised end
Be a part of the grand parade
Along we're driven
On and on, it's a grand parade
We're one, we're so sorry to say
It's all the same, you will see
On this grand parade
Damnation
Now join the grand parade

Don't be upset (I will seal every door)
Every now and then (Seal every door)
They'll try to awake the misguided (I will seal every door)
The voices you'll hear
They will claim to be real (It's not true)

Now look around
We will bring them down
The more I'll show
The less you will know
The Nine will frown
Now see how it grows
Secretly my vision comes true

It's not real
You'll hear it, you'll see it
The otherworl, the otherworld
The otherworld appears

Now round and round
We all shall lose ground
Now praise, I'm the one

We will never fear
We will never fear
We will never fear them again

Oh and here comes the son,
The son
He's gone with the shadows
Along with the stars

No more gods, no more lies

No more gods, no war
We'll be free here,
We are one, our will is strong

No more lies and no more tyrants
It all becomes real when the sealing is over

Say goodbye, my friend
Here's your promised end
Be a part of the grand parade
Along we're driven
On and on, it's a grand parade
We're one, we're so sorry to say
It's all the same, you will see
On this grand parade
Damnation
Now join the grand parade

There is no return
It would be the end

We shall sing
We shall sing
Praise the day

Void we don't fear you no more
Mother void you can't enter no more

We don't need any hallows
We don't fear any shadows
Shadows on the wall
They're not real
Now, walk in, everyone

Here comes the sun

We will never fall
We will never fall
We will never see him again

Many
We're one
We're humanized
The time has come

This flesh is truth
This blood is real
The highest cause
It's all that we are longing for

There on the river Styx
You'll see, my friend
There on the river Styx
You'll see
They've fooled you to take it away

So no more myths
No more bliss
We are holding it in our hand
And there is nothing they can do

And so this battle ends forevermore
We don't fear anything
Nor any other race

We take control
No longer we act like fools
We're in control

Say goodbye, my friend
Here's your promised end
Be a part of the grand parade
Along we're driven
On and on, it's a grand parade
We're one, we're so sorry to say
It's all the same, you will see
On this grand parade
Damnation
Now join the grand parade

Drown one more time
While we all will say goodbye
Bright, it shines bright
Let us carry one the lie
No more lies
