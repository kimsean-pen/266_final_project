You wake up late you feel your heart begin to work
And now you're all dressed up of course
And hailing cabs out of your door

On 14th street I feel my head between
My knees and orange swimming through the trees
And orange swimming through the trees

Where could I go what could I do
Put in the state my lips and eyes
Give me away wnd now there's
Nothing I can say no

I'm pulled away I see another of myself
Who's found true love and happiness
To sit and smoke there on the chair for

Two boys: one to kiss your neck
And one to bring you breakfast
Get you out of bed when
You're sore from the night before from
Knocking at my door you head against
The floor boards

Two boys: one to love you sweetly
One does so discreetly never will
He meet me but
I'm sure that you'll catch your breath
You'll sleep into the day to wake up
With sunlight across your room

Before I leave I want to try to go back
In time to just that moment in my life
Where I should have spoke up but I lied

As I sat there with my jaw open
And I smiled he pulled his sweater off
And tried to explain he'd all but given
Up one love

I'm pulled away I see another of myself
Who's found true love and happiness
To sit and smoke there on the chair for

Beside the bed I read this past week's
New Yorker and I watch him paint Antarctica
And watch him paint Antarctica

Two boys: one to kiss your neck and
One to bring you breakfast
Get you out of bed when
You're sore from the night before from
Knocking at my door you head against
The floor boards

Two boys: one to love you sweetly
One does so discreetly never will
He meet me but
I'm sure that you'll catch your breath
You'll sleep into the day to wake up
With sunlight across your room
