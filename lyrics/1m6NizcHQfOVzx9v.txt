Make the rules for me to live by
Rules you break and just let it slide
You try to find you inside of me
Be as great as you want me to be

Hypocrite, the word that fits
Do as you say, not as you do

You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me to a breakpoint
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint

Self-esteem you seem to lack
You point your finger, three pointing back
So's the illusion of old golden dance
Evil's contagious and life ain't that fair

Criticisms, the word that fits
Put me down to lift you up

You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me to a breakpoint
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint

Watching pain, your only pleasure
Fascination for sick disaster
Suffering since you were born
Mess with the bull you'll get the horn

Misery, the word that fits
Times are good when times are bad

You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me... pushing me... to a breakpoint

"In my opinion as a professional
I recommend we straitjacket the son of a bitch
Lock him in a rubber room, sedate him heavily
And when he wakes up, if he wakes up, we'll see if he can be a nice boy"

"Sedate me? Ha, cool!
A straitjacket? Hey, hey, let go of me, hey..."

Breakpoint, you've pushed me to a breakpoint
Breakpoint, you've pushed me to a breakpoint
Breakpoint, don't push me
