Oh yeah

I thought I'd see you smile
When I walked in the door
Thought those arms of yours would be open wide
The way they were before

Why do you look at me
Like I'm some stranger now?
Why do you pull away
When you used to hold me so tight?

Don't you love me anymore?
Have you learned
To live your life without me?
Don't you love me anymore, anymore?

When did the fire go out?
Where did the feeling go?
Did it slip away when I wasn't there?
Baby, now I've come home

I thought you'd want me babe
I was so sure you'd ask me to stay
I thought you'd need this too
Guess it didn't work out that way

Don't you love me anymore?
Have you learned
To live your life without me?
Don't you love me anymore, Darling?

When did the fire go out?
Where did the feeling go?
Why do you pull away
When you used to hold me so close, baby?

Don't you love me anymore?
Have you learned
To live your life without me?
Don't you love me anymore?

Don't you love me anymore?
Have you learned
To live your life without me?
Don't you love me anymore?

Don't you love me anymore?
