Can you tell me a story without any words
Then mould me misshapen from the soaking dirt
Keep feeding me courage that I don't deserve
So I don't feel broken like I have no worth
My apathy's growing and I never learn
I'm spending this token so I don't get burned

And it seems like I'm never gonna make this feel right
I'm drowning in a wave of insight
I'll never be the one to breathe and sigh but I'll survive
Storm clouds even though the sun has gone down
Negative emotions inbound
I'll never be the one to make a sound but I'll survive

Can you whittle me a token of strength and rebirth
Can you wrap it in linen and a stolen curse
Make strength from the knowledge that this always hurts
Now keep your eyes open so it won't get worse
My apathy's growing and I never learn
I'm spending this token so I don't get burned

And it seems like I'm never gonna make this feel right
I'm drowning in a wave of insight
I'll never be the one to breathe and sigh but I'll survive
Storm clouds even though the sun has gone down
Negative emotions inbound
I'll never be the one to make a sound but I'll survive

And it seems like I'm never gonna make this feel right
I'm drowning in a wave of insight
I'll never be the one to breathe and sigh but I'll survive
Storm clouds even though the sun has gone down
Negative emotions inbound
I'll never be the one to make a sound but I'll survive
I can make you feel alive
And you know I don't regret it
And you know I don't regret it
I can make you feel alive
And you know I don't regret it
And you know I don't regret it
