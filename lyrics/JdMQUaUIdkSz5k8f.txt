Wind taking space signing by a screen
Would you dance, still leave my
Sense the feeling, let the spirits rise with me
Bow to the shore, designed to swing to the right
I follow, rust goes round and all the
Nerval spirits rise

Onward with you through your darkest nights
I will follow you, I can't still believe
I'm one of those heroes
But through me, through me the ages deep from the star resort
Magical minds seeking tongue
Mayhem dance

Heaven and earth together in the dance of the life forever
We adore the moon and the madness singing free
Swing to your left? bow to your right
And gather all the mold that's peering
Gathered by the sun

Onward with you through your darkest nights
I will follow you, I can't still believe
I'm one of those heroes
But through me, through me the ages deep from the star resort
Magical minds seeking tongue
Mayhem dance
