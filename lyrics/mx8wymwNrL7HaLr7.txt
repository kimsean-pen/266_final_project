(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)

Brother, I feel you've been down
Tried to raise the rain from the ground
Can you hear my voice through the wall of sound?
Brother, I feel you've been down

Brother can't take more than this
You can free those words from your lips
Can't deny we've all got sins
Brother can't take more than this

Don't let the shine leave your lights
Rivers don't run in a straight line
A friend of mine
Blood's thicker than water

Don't fall from grace with open skies
Leading the blind with open eyes
No compromise
Blood's thicker than water
Blood's thicker than water

(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
Brother, don't worry

Brother, don't worry it's alright
There's no darkness without the light
Please don't fall it's not that high
Brother, don't worry it's alright, alright, alright, yeah

Don't let the shine leave your lights
Rivers don't run in a straight line
A friend of mine
Blood's thicker than water

Don't fall from grace with open skies
Leading the blind with open eyes
No compromise
Blood's thicker than water
Blood's thicker than water

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, hey, hey
Don't let the shine leave your lights
Rivers don't run in a straight line
A friend of mine
Blood's thicker than water

Don't fall from grace with open skies
Leading the blind with open eyes
No compromise
Blood's thicker than water

Don't let the shine leave your lights
Rivers don't run in a straight line
A friend of mine
Blood's thicker than water

Don't fall from grace with open skies
Leading the blind with open eyes
No compromise
Blood's thicker than water
Blood's thicker than water
Blood's thicker than water
