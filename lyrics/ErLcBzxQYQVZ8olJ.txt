Once they killed his monster when it went into a trap
Now he's making better ones on a higher step

On a warm summer day the doctor went away
To a place where he could make it real
His assistant's hips were nice
So he cloned her once or twice
Now his hips are aching what a deal

Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Let's them run into the night
They become great rock musicians
And their time is right,
time is right

Sometimes when he's feeling bored
He's calling it a day
He's got his computer and they do it their own way

They mix some DNA, some skin and a certain spray
You can watch it on a laser screen
And the fellow's blue and gray
Or sometimes pink and green
Just check it out on Halloween

Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Let's them run into the night
They become great politicians
And their time is right

One night he cloned himself
Put his brother on a shelf
But when he fell asleep that night
It crept up from behind
And thought "well never mind "
Took a syringe and blew out his life

Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Let's hem run into the night
They become a great possession
And their time is right
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Let's hem run into the night
They become a great oppression
And their time is right
Time is right
Time is right
Time is right
