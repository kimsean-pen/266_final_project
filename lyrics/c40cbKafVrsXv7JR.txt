Stop
Take it slowly, Darling
This time
I'm feeling a change
Stop
You're thinking too much about it
Loves gonna heal us
Again and again
(Sway)
Just move with me, Darling
And I'm gonna move with you too
Can't Stop
Now you got me started
On top
Such a beautiful view
(Again and again)
(Sway)
(Sway)
Sway
(Sway)
Sway
Just move with me, Darling
Sway
Just move with me, Darling
Sway
Just move with me, Darling
Sway
Just move with me, Darling
(Again and again)
Sway
(Sway)
(Sway)
Sway
(Sway)
