Let it come down, let it all come down
Get up, get in, get out
Do you have something to say?
Only you don't get to talk, not to me that way
Let it come down, let it all come down
Come on, come on, come on
Are you feeling the same?
I will still be standing here when you walk away
I don't know anymore what I need and what for
All I know is there must be something more
Let it come down, let it all come down
You know, you know, you know
It don't matter what those people say
You don't want to live your life someone else's way
I don't know anymore what I need and what for
All I know is there must be something more
La, di, di, la, di, da
how did we ever get this far?
Well, I know that there must be something more
Let it come down, let it all come down
Come on, come on, come on
I know you got something to say?
Only you don't get to talk, not to me that way
I don't know anymore what I need and what for
All I know is there must be something more
La, di, di, la, di, da
how did we ever get this far?
Well, I know that there must be something more
