Look at me
A million pictures on the cenotaph
Look at me
There's nothing left but silent epitaphs
Through reassembly I've come to deceive you
Behind interpretations someone's untrue
Look at me
If you could see what I see I know that you would hate me

Do what I will
By no means there are no guards
Promising a strong protection
Lasting through a lifetime
Hide and seek, what you will find
Another day, another time
Where love does not exist

Look at me
I never saw your starlit face
And never heard the words you spoke
Look at me
In countless glints, so smoky gold,
The days shift away leaving you here
