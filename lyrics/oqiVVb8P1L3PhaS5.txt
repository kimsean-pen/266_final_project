Gimme that z-o-l-o-f-t
Gimme a grip, make me love me
Suckin' 'em down, I'm happy man
Can feel it inside, makin' me smile

...realize that the sky's not made of gold
Don't disguise the nature of your soul

Gimme that z, o-l-o-f-t
No longer pissed and you don't bother me
I'm makin' it through, I'm givin' my all
When base are loaded, I'm whacking the ball

...don't suck the mind, don't drain the source
The path of life's not so easy to course, buddy

Gimme that z-o-l-o-f-t
(I can't explain why I'm feeling this way)
Gimme a grip, make me love me
(Trips in the barren for the month[?])
Suckin' 'em down, I'm happy man
(Are you a monkey or a man-child)
Can feel it inside, makin' me smile
Z-o-l-o-f-t
