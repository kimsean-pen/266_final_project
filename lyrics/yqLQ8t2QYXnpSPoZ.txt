First glance, you nearly made my jaw drop
First dance, and you were looking so hot
Held hands, I moved in for a lip-lock
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby

A first taste like honey, you were so yum
Can't wait for a second 'cause it's so fun
Third base and headed for a home run
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby now

Hold on tight to this roller coaster ride
And if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

And just let go, if you don't, we'll never know
So if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

My place, you showed up with flowers
Your face, could stare at it for hours
Can't wait to see your superpowers
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby

Your car, I'm sitting right beside you
Rock star at everything that you do
My heart is ready for the next move
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby now

Hold on tight to this roller coaster ride
And if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

And just let go, if you don't, we'll never know
So if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

Yeah yeah, not yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on tight

Hold on tight to this roller coaster ride
And if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

And just let go, if you don't, we'll never know
So if you're loving this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

Yeah yeah, not yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
('cause you ain't seen nothing yet)
Yeah yeah, not yet
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

Yeah yeah, not yet
(And just let go)
Yeah yeah, not yet
(If you don't we'll never know)
Yeah yeah, not yet
(And if you're loving this just give me one more kiss)
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
