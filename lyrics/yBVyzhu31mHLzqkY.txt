I thought I'd come to you
And your long lazy scene
Instate direction, finger on a magazine.
I'd call you when I need you
I can't get used to your new name.

Send a body double over with your keys
She'll see you in an hour
Everybody quiet please.
Essex house is down the road
The actors want to be alone.

Your room is still and soft
As a jeweler's.
Incidental music coming down the hall
Remember when I never had to wait for you at all?
I wish my hands were yours as I lay your keys
On a magazine.

Take me to LaGuardia
My baby's gonna pay for me.

Bottle from the duty-free
I'll drink it all across the sea.
Lay me down business class
Headphones and a sleeping mask.

She's gonna pay for me
She's gonna pay for me.

Brother, I wish you were home
Just tell me you're not alone
Call me back; I'm on a plane
I think I'm somewhere over spain.
I'm in the dark without the stars
I've never seen a black suit dark
Thought I'd be above the rain
Somewhere on a higher plane.

Oh brother, I wish you were home
My brother, I wish you were home.

Baby, you're asleep by now
You never stayed awake for me
You never waited up for me,
No, you never waited up for me!
Now there's nothing I can do
I lost you but i beat the sound
Couldn't if I wanted to
The cogwheel doesn't turn around!

Oh brother, I wish you were home
My baby is in a room alone.

My brother, I wish you were home.
