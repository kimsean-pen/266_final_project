I can't live without it
Can't even dream without it
It's got me all worn up, it's killin' me
I knew the day I saw her
I felt the road get tighter
Oh I was so much brighter
It blinded me
I know that she never even needed me
Her cold cold heart
I shiver when I see her
I can't let her in here
The walls are getting nearer, closing in
A shallow graveyard haunts me
Its presence always taunts me
Another reason for me to never sin
I know that she never even needed me
Her cold cold heart
Can't dream without her and woke up in Arabia
Her cold cold heart
