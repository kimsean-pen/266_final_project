I got the picket fence
I got the perfect shiny stone
It don't make any sense
Here, but nobody's home

Used to tell you every little thing about me
You would swear that you could never live without me
Well we said, we said, we said, we said
We said a lot of things
We said a lot of things

For worse or for better
For ever and ever
I do, I do, I do
In health and in sickness
As God is my witness
I do, I do, I do

Remember you told me
You're my one and only
I don't wanna be here
I think I should leave here
I do, I do, I do

I got the pretty dress
I got the memories in a frame
It don't make any sense
Cause those people are us, but they're just not the same

I'd do anything I could not to lose this
But I look at you and I know what the truth is
Yeah, we said, we said, we said, we said
We said a lot of things
Didn't mean anything

For worse or for better
For ever and ever
I do, I do, I do
In health and in sickness
As God is my witness
I do, I do, I do

Remember you told me
You're my one and only
I don't wanna be here
I think I should leave here
I do, I do, I do

We closed our eyes
We made our wishes
But in real life
You can't always fix it

For worse or for better
For ever and ever
I do, oh
In health and in sickness
As God is my witness
I do

For worse or for better
For ever and ever
I do, I do, I do (I do!)
In health and in sickness
As God is my witness
I do, I do, I do

Remember you told me
You're my one and only
I don't wanna be here
I think I should leave here
I do, I do, I do

I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I do
