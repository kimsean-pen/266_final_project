Composed of an element so weak, so frail
Every time she reaches for the sky,
she fails
The escape from her shattered existence
Lies above out of her reach
But still sinking further and further
Into her own self-pity

The crack, the cut, the shattered tears
That hit the pavement (2x)

In this crumbling existence,
like a champagne glass
Held together at its last seams (2x)

With every try there's a little more bleeding
As her heart is leaking

The crack, the cut, the shattered tears
That hit the pavement

All she wants to do now is finish this
Tip the glass to the floor
Watch it shatter

So she will strive and strive
reaching for the sky
As she cuts and bleeds
Waiting for the day she strives to be
This broken glass thrown into heaven
