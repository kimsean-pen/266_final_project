We are falling down so slowly
In small pieces like your kingdom of glass
We've been waiting for so long
And this is just a beginning

I hear your thin voice calling from the mist
A distant siren awakens me from sleep
And I know I have to be ready
I take a deep breath and walk outside

Black rain falls down hard
So tired to find shelter
We are the ones to blame
So you better walk away

One solution for all of us
And we agreed with hope shining through our eyes
Was it another big mistake
We don't know maybe it's better that way

Black rain falls down hard
So tired to find shelter
We are the ones to blame
So you better walk away

See yourself standing in a crowd
Red light is on and we are waiting
Ready to burn down the sky
Born to tear down the future
