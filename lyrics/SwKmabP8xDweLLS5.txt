Don't know when
I will leave you again
Grab a reason and I'm dragging you down

Come just to make you happy
Shot in the head, I can see
I can see it but I can't feel it

Don't know when
I will leave you again
Grab a reason and I'm dragging you down

Come just to make you happy
Shot in the head, I can see
I can see it but I can't feel it
