Someone be my witness that she walked away
Say I said things that I didn't say
Broke my heart, and said she don't love me, she don't love me
Someone, uuhu see the sad eye that I can see
And all she is it's just a fantasy
Damn her, for what she said she don't love me, she don't love me

Watch her as she goes, passed out Hollywood ball
I see her out of your car and she passes by
Her ex lover's glad it was different from them
She's leaving her trail of broken hearts
Curtains will close at the Hollywood ball
The pain that she has is in black and white
She said baby it's hard when you burn like a star
She's leaving her trail of broken hearts

Someone, someone else don't know I tell the truth
The trail of hearts is all you need for proof
I'm not the fastest at, she don't love them she don't love them
Sometimes, uuhu sometimes I wish that I could see her again
Oh God it happened she was beautiful when
She held my hand and said she don't love me, she don't love me

Watch her as she goes, passed out Hollywood ball
I see her out of your car and she passes by
Her ex lover's glad it was different from them
She's leaving her trail of broken hearts
Curtains will close at the Hollywood ball
The pain that she has is in black and white
She said baby it's hard when you burn like a star
She's leaving her trail of broken hearts

There's nothing you can do about it
There's nothing you can say

Watch her as she goes, passed out Hollywood ball
I see her out of your car and she passes by
Her ex lover's glad it was different from them
She's leaving her trail of broken hearts
Curtains will close at the Hollywood ball
The pain that she has is in black and white
She said baby it's hard when you burn like a star
She's leaving her trail of broken hearts

Uuhu, she said baby it's hard when you burn like a star
She's leaving her trail of broken hearts
