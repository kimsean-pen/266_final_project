Pretty wings
Your the prettiest thing
Your like Parker Posey in a magazine
with faded jeans and a crop top back in '93

I wanna be your dressed in black
Your dark star with a backwards hat
Im gonna write you a book and put your name on every page
Every page
Hey pretty little mockingbird keep singing them sad sad songs
Theres already rain on my window
Im dying when the morning comes
Flew away in the night with a raven
And now im underneath the willows hanging
Im to strung out to be upside down
Pretty little mockingbird sing your song

I was the desert honey you were the sand
I was a bird baby you were the branch
I flew into the blue and watched those flowers dying

It wasn't much just everything
You could have sat right there and got high with me
But you fell asleep and your dreaming brought the nightmares
Brought the nightmares

Hey pretty little mockingbird keep singing them sad sad songs
Theres already rain on my window
Im dying when the morning comes
Flew away in the night with a raven
And now im underneath the willows hanging
Im to strung out to be upside down
Pretty little mockingbird sing me a song

Yeah pretty little mockingbird keep singing them sad sad songs
Theres already rain on my window
Im dying when the morning comes
Flew away in the night with a raven
And now im underneath the willows hanging
Im to strung out to be upside down
Pretty little mockingbird
Pretty little mockingbird sing me a song
