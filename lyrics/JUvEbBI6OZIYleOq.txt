As the cars go by under the sun like an enemy
You wonder X3
As a spider comes and looks at you like an enemy
You wonder X3
Yeah miles, miles away
She's hurting people in a better world
Miles, miles away
Dressed again in the hot water
and you're more beautiful than ever
Looking in the car rear view mirror

Floor is hard uncomforted
By the second time she wondered she hungered she hungers
Like a killer's wife
As the cars go by X3
Yeah, as the cars go by
Miles, miles away
She's hurting people in a better world
Miles, miles away
Dressed again in the hot water
Well you're more beautiful than ever
Looking in the car rear view mirror
Yeah, you're more beautiful than ever
Miles, miles, miles, miles away
Miles, miles away...
