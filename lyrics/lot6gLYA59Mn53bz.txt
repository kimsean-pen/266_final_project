The blazing sunset
In your eyes
Will tantalize
Every man
Who looks your way
I watched them sink
Before your gaze
Seniorita sway
Dance with me
Before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love
Like a ragged soldier
Catching butterflies

No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow
I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you

In the heat of the morning

I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end
Organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you
Daylight for a friend
I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done
Oh, I'm so much in love
Like the little boy

Who races with the wind
No man loved like I love you

Wouldn't you like to love me too
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings

And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
