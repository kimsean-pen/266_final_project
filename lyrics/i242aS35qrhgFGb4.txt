I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from nine to five, hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I, do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone and

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?

When I come home at nights
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on TV see me?
Or am I just being paranoid?
Or am I just being paranoid?
When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone there
People say I'm crazy, just a little nuts
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?

I'm just an average guy
With an average life
I work from nine to five
Hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone
In my average home
But why do I always feel
Like I'm in the twilight zone

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?
