cherry tree hung over me
waving with empathy
falling flowers lay me down
tell me life's a passing cloud
falling flowers spinning round
cover me up, lay me down

it's not a lot to know
it's not a lot to know
it's not a lot to know

cherry tree cherry tree
my favorite remedy
your flowers comfort me

it's not a lot to know
it's not a lot to know
it's not a lot to know
