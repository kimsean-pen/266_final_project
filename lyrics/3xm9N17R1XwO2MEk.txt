I regarded the world as such a sad sight
Until I viewed it in black and white
Then I reviewed every frame
And basic shape
And sealed the exits with caution tape
(Dear Vienna)
Don't refocus your eyes
In the darkness

And don't remember this place unless
I describe all the things that you cannot see
And we'll unravel the mystery

Farewell
All my friends
In textbooks
I'm going home
'Cause my blood cells
Cannot depend

On the weather
In photographs
There's a light show
Out my window
Somewhere
Way up there
Dear Vienna
Are you singing?

Dear Vienna
Are you swinging?
Dear Vienna

We were happy like the shades of May
When we got carried away
(Dear Vienna)

(Dear Vienna)
I regarded the world as such a sad sight
Until I viewed it in black and white
Then I reviewed every frame
And basic shape
And sealed the exits with caution tape
(Dear Vienna)
Don't refocus your eyes
In the darkness
And don't remember this place unless
I describe all the things that you cannot see
And we'll unravel the mystery
(Dear Vienna)

(Dear Vienna)
I was so far out of place
Watching those stars
In outer space
'Cause I am so far
From where you are
There's a light show
Out my window
Somewhere
Way up there
Dear Vienna
Are you singing?
Dear Vienna
Are you swinging?
Dear Vienna
We were happy like the shades of May
When we got carried away
(Dear Vienna)
