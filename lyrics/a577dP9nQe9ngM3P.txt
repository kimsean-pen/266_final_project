I've been swallowed up, spat out and kicked around
You really know where you stand when it all comes down
They tried to clean me up while they cleaned me out
They try to take what they can but it all comes 'round

I never needed any one
Until I crashed into the sun

Goodbye Hollywood
You just don't fit me like it should
Now I've found a place to call my own

Life can build you up just to knock you down
It takes a lot more than red, yeah to paint this town

I never needed any one
Until I crashed into the sun

So goodbye Hollywood
You just don't fit me like it should
Now I've found a place to call my own
I'm coming home

Goodbye Hollywood
You just don't fit me like it should
Now I've found a place to call my own

I feel my time has come, I'm not the only one
I feel a time for a change in a world come undone
You try and pull me in, I will push you out
You try to stop me you know I can scream and shout, yeah

So goodbye Hollywood
Your sweet success don't taste that good
Now I've found a place to call my own

Goodbye Hollywood, goodbye Hollywood
Now I've found a place to call my own
I'm coming home

So goodbye Hollywood
I just don't need you like they said I would
Now I've found a place to call my own
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
