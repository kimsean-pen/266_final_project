Well the cops are taking over
While everyone's in yoga
'Coz happiness is still a warm gun
What's it to be free man?
What's a European?
Me I just believe in the sun

Take me down
Through the streets of China Town
Show me that you know some places
God told me live a life of luxury
All our lives we've both been waiting

Telephonic doses, eliminate neurosis
And some say it's the cause of it all
Concentrate on winning
Forget about beginning
Forget about the middle and end

Take me down through the streets of China Town
Show me that you know some places
God told me live a life of luxury
All our lives we've both been waiting

Take me down through the streets of China Town
Show me that you know some places
God told me live a life of luxury
All our lives we've both been waiting
