A drop in the ocean,
Moved in slow motion
And it hit me out of the blue
I follow blindly, however unlikely
That i'd find you, I'd find you, I just knew
Here I am
I lost you once
I won't lose you again
The dead ends a living hell
The story you can't tell
But your words still get through
Here I am
I lost you once
I won't lose you again
And I am here
I love you
I love you
I miss you still
Here I am
Here I am
Here I am
I lost you once, I won't lose you again
I lost you once, I won't lose you again
I lost you once, I won't lose you again
