Said goodbye to that car
It took a bullet in the roof in your haven
[?] sad estrangement
Idling there on the pavement

119, 657 and the engine blew
119, 657 and I thought of you
Said goodbye to that car in the cul-de-sac
Said goodbye to that car, took the plates off the back

Pulled off the charms and the beads
Unceremoniously
It was the end of an era
I kicked off the rear view mirror

From the day it run and
To the rust stains in the cracks
I watched the heap of metal lose its sun
As the sky turned black

119, 657 and the engine blew
119, 657 and I thought of you
Said goodbye to that car as the sky turned black
Said goodbye to that car, took the plates off the back

119, 657 and the engine blew
119, 657 and I thought of you
119, 657 and the engine blew
119, 657 and I thought of you
119, 657 and I thought of you
