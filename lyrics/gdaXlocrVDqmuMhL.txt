Lose yourself in the glow,
Rise and fall, breath in slow.
Oh oh oh.
Left the sky paint it all,
Fall your eyes, fall our souls
Fall our souls.

Hear my swan song
Oh oh, it was my mistake
Catch a kiss now,
Swan song
Help me to escape.

You cast your spell,
With stories told
Promises, will they unfold?

Hear my swan song
Oh oh, it was my mistake
Catch a kiss now,
Swan song
Help me to escape.

I still hope eyes will fall
Out the line, out the line
Let me go
It's alright
It's alright.

Hear my swan song
Oh oh, it was my mistake
Catch a kiss now,
Swan song
Help me to escape.
