I'd like to hear the words from you
That I know you're too scared to say
I haven't wanted those words before

It's the first, it's the first time
It's the first, it's the first time
If you can't see what's going on
If you can't see what's going on
What's going on
What's going on now

You've got that way of making me feel
Oh so scared and safe at once
I didn't know that this was real

It's the first, it's the first time
It's the first, it's the first time
If you can't see what's going on
If you can't see what's going on
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on now
