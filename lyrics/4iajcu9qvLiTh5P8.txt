I've been driving through these nights
This road reminding me of all I am
As time drags on, these windows fade
Reality starts slipping from my mind
All I know is this all fades, the second that I'm by your side
Can this be real, can this be fate

Just say you'll be there for me
Please say that you'll be there
Just say that you'll be my side
When the storm subsides

All these years beneath the skin
Everything inside me turning to the shame
I was lost, but now I can see
This fate is turning deep inside of me
All I know is this all fades, the second that I'm by your side
Can this be real, can this be fate

Just say that you'll be with me
Please say that you'll be there
Just say that you'll be my side
When the storm subsides
