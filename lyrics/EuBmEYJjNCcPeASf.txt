Dream, man machined
I'm the vision of hostility
the bread crumbs you trail in a world you once belonged

Safe, in the thought,
you choose love as if you have been taught
To stray from your heart is an idea you wish wasn't wrong

And so began
the tale of a man.
who was mad in his brain
He longed for a dream where he was sane
and everyone else
was somebody else

visions of lust
I'm caught in complete disarray
