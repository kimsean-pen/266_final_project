I've been thinking, about tomorrow
Instead of drowning in the past
Oh we had good times even back when
Dreams were all we had to last
So as I wake up this bright morning
Nothing's gonna bring me down
Waves are singing, wind is warm and
Summer's here to stick around

I still, remember me before you
I will, no longer need your rescue
Since I still, remember me before you
I'm no fool
Tell them, I'm no fool
It's all clear, perfectly crystal
I've been here long enough to know
When to leave and when to tell you

Time has come to close the show

I still, remember me before you
I will, no longer need your rescue
Since I still, remember me before you
I'm no fool
Tell them, I'm no fool
I'm no fool
Tell them, I'm no fool
Heeey I'm no fool
You need to know that I'm no fool
I am no fool
Baby I'm no fool
