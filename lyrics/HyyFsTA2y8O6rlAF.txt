Another way, another way to your heart
It started to look like seconds
And then we're off
The more you take to yourself
The more you take it away
You settle in, you settle into your fear
It started to look like echoes
And then we're off
The more you want to be said
The words believing the way

Oh, kinder ways
Oh, kinder ways to your garden
Another way, another way till it stays
You gotta hold my hand

Oh, kinder ways
Oh, kinder ways to your garden
Oh, true to say
It doesn't matter what you saw

To run away, run away to those lot
Start a herd like seconds
And then we'll get up
You know the moment to dissolve
You know the minute it's gone
There's still a lid, still a lid that's in your fear
Find a way to fit it, but nothing is up
You won't demand it to explain
You got the money

Oh, kinder ways
Oh, kinder ways to your garden
Oh, true to say
But we watched it fly

To run away, run away to this heart
You run away, run away until it stops
You are forgotten

To run away, run away to this heart
You run away, run away until it stops
You are forgotten
