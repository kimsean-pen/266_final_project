I taste you
Infinite colors
Collide in a fountain
Amidst all the lovers

Kaleidoscope dream

Can you imagine
A field of red lights
It flickers and flashes
Our joy is electric

Kaleidoscope dream

Oh oh,
Breath
Oh oh
Close your eyes
You're with me
Oh oh
Yeah

Reach high
Taste the sky
Just hold my hand
Across the moon
We'll hope to fly

You're safe with me
You're safe with me
Yeah, body language like piano keys
Allow me to provoke things

Make you sing a melody
Every single stroke babe
And as I kiss your third eye
Bet your love come sweet

Only you can be my Kaleidoscope dream
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)

All these ...? usin' a ray of amusement
Makin' the stars from the sky

Kaleidoscope dream

Body language like piano keys
Allow me to provoke thee
Make you sing a melody
Every single stroke babe
And as I kiss your third eye
Let (until.?) your love come sweet

Only you can be my Kaleidoscope dream
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)

Reach high
Taste the sky
Just hold my hand
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Across the moon
We'll hope to fly

You're safe with me
You're safe with me
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
