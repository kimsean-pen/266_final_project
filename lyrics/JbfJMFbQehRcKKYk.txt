Lime and limpid green
The second scene
The fights between
The blue you once knew

Floating down
The sound resounds
Around the icy
Water underground

Jupiter and Saturn
Oberon there on the run
Titanian, Neptune, Titan
Stars get frighten

Winding signs flap
Flicker flicker flicker flap
Pow! Stairways scared
And death rules there

Blindman limpid
Green the sound
Surrounds the icy water on the
Lime and limpid green the sound
Surrounds the icy
Waters underground
