I can settle dow-own
And be doin' just fine
Til I hear an old train
Rollin' down the line
Then I hurry
Strai-aight home and pack
And if I didn't go
I believe I'd blow my stack
I love you ba-aby
But you gotta understand
When the Lord made me
He made a ramblin' man

Some folks
Might sa-ay that I'm no good
That I wouldn't settle down
If I could
But when that open ro-oad
Starts to callin' me
There's somethin'
O'er the hill
That I gotta see
Sometimes it's har-rd
But you gotta understand
When the Lord made me
He made a ra-amblin' man

I love to see
The tow-owns a-passin' by
And to ride these rails
'Neath God's blue sky
Let me travel this la-and
From the mountains to the sea
'Cause that's the life
I believe He meant for me
And when I'm go-one
And at my grave you stand
Just say God
Called home
Your ra-amblin' man
