Life is a sponge ball
Thrown with the wild dawn
And if I'm gonna swing then
I must get motivated

Instead of lyin' in my bed
I'm like a train bed
Truckin' down a fast hill
Heartbreak is overrated

If I'm drying the tears now
I can get a head-start out the door

I never loved the sun until it rained
I'll never get anywhere if I stay
In the same place always afraid of

Gonna just get stuck in a dream
Where the answer's clear but no one knows it
It's like a toss up, I gotta get of here
'Cause I'm tired of the motions

I'm in blue, no more
Walkin' 'round in a circle
Deja vu no more
Walkin' 'round in a circle

Being attendant
Is never the one trick
I ever woulda messed up
One quirk and get your focus

'Cause the start of the circle
Is also the ending
One door has to close
Before the next can open

Gotta come and live with
New life is a give in, once we go

I never loved the sun until it rained
I'll never get anywhere if I stay
In the same place always afraid of

And just get stuck in a dream
Where the answer's clear but no one knows it
It's like a toss up, I gotta get out of here
'Cause I'm tired of the motions

I'm in blue, no more
Walkin' 'round in a circle
Deja vu no more
Walkin' 'round in a circle

How can I be my best if I never fail?
And how can I ever find peace if I never yell?
I gotta be stronger, I can't let the wind blow
Me on a cold night, I'll follow the skylight

Yeah, I am no longer

And just get stuck in a dream
Where the answer's clear but no one knows it
It's like a toss up, I gotta get out here
'Cause I'm tired of the motions

I'm in blue, no more
Walkin' 'round in a circle
Deja vu no more
Walkin' 'round in a circle

Walkin' round in a circle
