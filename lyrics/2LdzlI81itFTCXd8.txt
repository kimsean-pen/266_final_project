All the men before me swollen with sin
Scrape the earth nude and clean
Ground to till, air to breathe
With missteps for no one

When we drew this, our best plan
Imperial, with no regrets

She needs to love me still
Until I've had my fill
I try and try to leave
I want to watch you bleed

Now we all dream alone
Now we all dream alone

Hostile as I once was
And I once was cruel
Piles of dust immolate
All in the same room
With missteps for no one

When we drew this, a dark map
In heaven there are no regrets

She needs to love me still
Until I've had my fill
I try and try to leave
I want to watch you grieve

Now we all dream alone
Now we all dream alone

She needs to love me still
Until I've had my fill
I try and try to leave
I want to watch you grieve

Now we all dream alone
Now we all dream alone
Now we all dream alone
Now we all dream alone
Now we all dream alone
