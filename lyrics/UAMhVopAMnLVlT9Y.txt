I like the way you say my name babe
And the way you wake up on a Sunday
Rolling around like two warm animals
I hope that you feel the same way
Yeah I hope that you feel the same way

How much should I be reading into
The way you look at me in your room
And I know that nothing's really permanent
I hope that this doesn't end soon
Yeah I hope that this doesn't end soon

Oooo and if it feels right
Who's to tell you that it ain't right?
And when it feels right
Oh my my you know it feels right
And if it feels right
Who's to tell you that it ain't right
And when it feels right

I like the way you say my name babe
Yeah I like the way you say my name babe
I like the way you say my name babe
Yeah I like the way you say my name babe
Hey!
I like the way you say my name babe
Oh I like the way you say my name babe
