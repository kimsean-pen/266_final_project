Been on top of the world since about six months ago
Marking the first time I laid eyes on you
I lost all train of thought as I entered the room
Saw what looked like really good food
Then I saw you and so did you

I wanna wake up naked next to you
Kissing the curve in your clavicle
Kissing your clavicle

Been on top of the world since about one week ago
Marking a time when I was drunk enough to talk to you
I lost all train of thought as your eyes met mine
Told you I thought you were gorgeous
You gave me your phone number, I gave you mine.

Before you left, I said that you can bet
I'll be bothering you soon
You said "No bother, please do"

I've called you twice
It's been a hellish fight
To not think about you all the time
Sitting around waiting for your call

I wanna wake up naked next to you
Kissing the curve in your clavicle
Kissing your clavicle

I wanna wake up naked next to you
Kissing the curve in your clavicle
