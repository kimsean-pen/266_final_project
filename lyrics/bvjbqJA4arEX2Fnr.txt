Wish I could
I could have said goodbye
I would have said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you

If I knew it would be the last time
I would have broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you

Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love again
I'll never love again

When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself lying in your arms
And I wanna pretend that it's not true
Oh baby that you're gone
'Cause my world keeps turning and turning and turning
And I'm not moving on

Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love

I don't wanna know this feeling unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment

And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you

Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips
Don't want to give my heart away to another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
Ooh I'll never love again
Love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again

I won't I won't I swear I can't
I wish I could but I just won't
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again
Who
Hmmm
