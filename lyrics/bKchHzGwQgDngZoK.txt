Good morning sir
The crushed red pecker
Was way up late
In the funny house

He may be calling
To blame the disease
He may be crawling
But please

Help is on its knees

Director of fleas and floral requests
Is willing to deal with the pests
But not Mr. Redbird
For what can he gain
Concerning the pain?

And even on auto-suggestion
His status remains in question
