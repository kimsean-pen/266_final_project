Stuck inside here baby
Don't know what to do
I see no way outta here
And it's gonna kill me soon

Outta my head, into the street
All the girls think I'm neat
I can't move
I can't see, I can't breathe

Breathing in the jungle
Blowing out the hate
My legs are moving fast
But that's okay
Flying high now baby
See the break of day
I've been here so damn long
That I'm gonna stay

Outta my head, into the street
All the girls think I'm neat
I can't move
I can't see, I can't breathe
