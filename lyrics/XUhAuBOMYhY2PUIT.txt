Avoiding this disaster
Seemed impossible
My heart is beating faster
Fast as it can go
'Cause I'm overthinking every word
That was never said or heard
Happy ever after?
I don't think so
I'm in love with someone who doesn't know I exist
I stare from afar in my hand-broken heart while I play pretend
I'm in love with someone who doesn't know I exist
And it's you, yes, it's true, you don't even know it, I can't ever win

Am I invisible?
Should I let it go?
Would you ever know?
Am I just another crazy laying on the low?
Am I invisible?
Will you ever see what you do to me?
Breaking hearts in the dark so easily
Am I invisible?

Tangled up and tongue-tied
What have I become?
Always got you on my mind
Got me feeling dumb
And I'm tripping over my own feet
And I'm mad you got the best of me
Falling for you slowly
From a distance

I'm in love with someone who doesn't know I exist
I stare from afar in my hand-broken heart while I play pretend
I'm in love with someone who doesn't know I exist
And it's you, yes, it's true, you don't even know it, I can't ever win
Am I invisible?
Should I let it go? Would you ever know?
Am I just another crazy laying on the low?
Am I invisible?
Will you ever see what you do to me?
Breaking hearts in the dark so easily
Am I invisible?

(Am I invisible?)
(Am I invisible?)
I'm in love with someone who doesn't know I exist
And it's you, yes, it's true, you don't even know it, I can't ever win

Am I invisible?
Should I let it go? Would you ever know?
Am I just another crazy laying on the low?
Am I invisible?
Will you ever see what you do to me?
Breaking hearts in the dark so easily
Am I invisible?
