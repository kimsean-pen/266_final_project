This time is real
I feel it passing through the telephone
No one is home now
No one is home
These stacks
They keep me down
So I build some more
America is just a word but I use it
Language keeps me locked and repeating
This time is real
I see it passing by the avenue
Nothing to do now
There's nothing to do
I see them spinning on
So I spin out
America is just a word but I use it
Language keeps me locked and repeating
