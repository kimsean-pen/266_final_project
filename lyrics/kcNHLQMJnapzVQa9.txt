It's just the way

It's just the way I want you baby, oh, so bad
It's just the feeling that comes over me, oh

I had a crush on you
Painstakingly I would conceal the truth
You probably always knew
But I was timid like a child, inhibited and way too shy
I'd glance but then avert my eyes
All twisted up in my desire

But I am not that girl today
Ain't got a lot of time for games
I've waited and I've waited now
It's time for me to tell you 'bout the way

It's just the way I want you, baby, oh, so bad
Every night and everyday, must we hesitate
It's just the feeling that comes over me
I cannot alleviate, please don't make me wait
It's just the way I want you baby, oh, so bad
Every night and everyday, day

Baby I was so into you
Now I wonder why I never pursued you
You're the way I wanted to, oh, no

Kiss me and touch me and immerse your love in mine
I'll keep unraveling as we explore our fantasies tonight
Tell me what you like
Now show me what you like

It's just the way I want you baby, oh, so bad
Every night and everyday
It's just the feeling that comes over me
I cannot alleviate, please don't make me wait

It's just the way I want you baby, oh
Why it's just the way?

Oh, it's just the way, I feel 'bout you every night and day
Oh, it's just the way, I can feel 'bout you every night and day
Oh, it's just the way, I feel 'bout you every night and day

It's just the way I want you, baby, oh, so bad
Every night and everyday, must we hesitate
It's just the feeling that comes over me
I cannot alleviate, please don't make me wait
It's just the way I want you baby, oh, so bad
Every night and everyday, day
