I feel younger everyday
The more I grow, the less I seem to know
I've been trying to keep my head straight
Where I roam, it never feels like home
You feel the weight of the world coming down on your head
These people looking at you, and now they're pulling you back
I've gotten sick of all it, it's in the palm of my hand
And I think it'll be there for good

We take a piece of ourselves, we draw a line on the sand
We say "don't cross this, or else", and then we put up a flag
Oh, how we worship the things that we don't quite understand
Oh, it's more dangerous than you know

I've got a message that you can't ignore
Maybe I'm just not the man I was before
Take this from me, take this lonely heart
'Cause I, 'cause I don't need it no more
I've got a hunger you will never taste
Craving a desire that won't go to waste
Take this from me, take this lonely heart
And I, I'm gonna make it my own

Someone took my ego away
Hate so long, I'll miss it now it's gone
Now my youth is being replaced
So, good night, it's gonna be alright

'Cause now I drink the good wine and now I get out of bed
And now I let myself love, and I'm not scared of the end
I take it all on the chin, and now I'd do it again
Because maybe it's time for a change
I've got a pain in my neck, because I keep looking up
I'm searching what's coming next, but it won't come from above
And there's a hole in my chest, like there's a hole in the sun
So tell me, what's coming next? I'm searching what's coming next
I've got a pain in my neck, because I keep looking up
I'm searching what's coming next, but it won't come from above
And there's a hole in my chest and I'll make it my heart

I've got a message that you can't ignore
Maybe I'm just not the man I was before
Take this from me, take this lonely heart
'Cause I, 'cause I don't need it no more
I've got a hunger you will never taste
Craving a desire that won't go to waste
Take this from me, take this lonely heart
And I, I'm gonna make it my own

There's a chance that you take that you risk your own fate
When you break all the chains that you feel comfortable in
There's a chance that I'll take so that my hunger can be free
In the end, in the end, in the end, in the end
