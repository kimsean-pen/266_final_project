Raindrops on roses and
Whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles
And warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

(30, you a mothafuckin' fool, nigga)

Done like Kendall Jenner
Got my first plug around 19
Saw someone shot when
They should have been fighting

Somethin' prestigious, precisely
Lookin' within just to sightsee

A murder scene (Bow-bow, bow)
Talkin' no beef, no pork and bean (Nah)

Trapped in my system

'Cause I was raised
Around the packs
And the pistols (Bow)
On her knees so long
She tore her meniscus (Wow)
Been a long road,
Check the distance (Road)
Rest in peace, tats the initials
Put it in black and
White like officials
Dope cases messin'
Up hoop dreams
All you know is get
Money is the routine
(Raindrops, roses)
Used to want birds
Like Larry (Swish)
Used to keep the white
Like Barry (Ayy, raindrops, roses)

Had the J's at the
End like Terrance
Vibin' on the terrace
With some red wine

Or it's state time
If you don't make time,
Better take time
