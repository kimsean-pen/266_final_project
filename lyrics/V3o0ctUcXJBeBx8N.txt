Western wall's a jumbo screen
At the gate, there's an automated teller machine
Sir, empty your pockets, please
Before you file through
The king and queen foreclosed on their crowns
The joker laughed and made his rounds
He was drunk, carrying on, self-satisfied

Western walls are closing in
"Are you happy?" he said
"Are you rich or are you dead?"
Dreaming the dream
Singing songs of another time
Is your gold so strangely acquired?
Has your name become known and desired?
Have you degenerated?
Are you running out of time?

Do you want nice things?
Sure, you do
Do you call your nice things your own?
Do you want nice things?
Sure, you do
Do you call your nice things your own?

Do you want to feel safe?
Climb the wall before the fall
No one is waiting for you
