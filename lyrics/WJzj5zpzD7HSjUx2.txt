My king, I'm humbled before you, I bow
Moods like you're pulled by the moonlight, somehow

How is the language we're speaking the same?
Shape shifter have you discovered a change?

Why does the soul hallucinate?
I've got control, I shift my shape

Your eyes, they swell like a riot, deranged
Tomorrow you're laughing like a child again

Why does the soul hallucinate?
I've got control, I shift my shape
If flesh and bone do not contain
The mirrors don't reflect my face

Psycho, you killer, you cancer, my friend
Why don't you give me an answer for when
When you'll let it go
