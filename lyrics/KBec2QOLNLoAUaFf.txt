Guess I never said
What I really felt
All the time we shared
Was so wonderful

Late nights, early start
For minutes every chance
The breaking of a glass
While others sleeping fast

To see your face, to see your eyes
You don't know what I'd do to be there
And in your hands
You hold the key to make a note of what we achieve
You can do what you like
So lift your eyes and tell me what you see in the sky

And I will play
Along with it
And pretend to know everything

If you want
You can change your mind
Take a while
To decide

Take some time
To understand
You will fall
To my hands
