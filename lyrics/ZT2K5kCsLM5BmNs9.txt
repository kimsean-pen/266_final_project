Lady
You bring me up when I'm down
Maybe
You're gonna change my life around
You came to me when I was lonely and no one cared
You made me see that I was only just running scared

I saw your face and something told me you were the one
You smiled at me and now I see my life's begun
(lady) Pretty lady
You bring me up when I'm down

Up when I'm down
(maybe)
You're gonna change my life around
Gonna change my life around yeah
Lady
You brought me in from out the rain
Yeah

(maybe)
My life will never be the same
Once I was filled with desperation a solitary man
You gave me hope and inspiration like only true love can
Now I believe in what you're saying
I'm ten feet tall
This love don't need no explaining
We've got it all...
Lady
You bring me up when I'm down
