Look at this and look at us
We wonder, oh, we're wondering
I don't like to say we're lost
Try my best with leading us

Build a ladder to the sky
Sit up there and say, 'oh My!
Does looking down make me a Queen?
With all the sorrow that I see'

If I ever get back down
Find a map that takes me back
Through the wounded, through the wars
To a time that came before

To hover-board into the Sun
And bring back when my time is done
A mother for this childless world
And an arrow of light for every boy and girl

Peace of mind
Peace of mind
Peace of mind
Peace of mind
Peace of mind
Peace of mind

Peace of mind
