I heard about love
But I'm not ready
I heard about trust
And what you said I believe
So what about us

It's already too much
And it's only just found
That's no masking love
When you pouring it out
When you can't get enough

I will never leave you in the dark
Gave you the center of my heart
The only one who shines a light on me
If you're leaving for somewhere, no matter what you do
I will be with you, oh, oh, oh
Like a sinking ship out there
I will get to you
Before I'll go sinking too

I'm running out of places that I can hid it
Why should we care what they say?
Do you know how it feel?
You don't know much, oh

I will never leave you in the dark
Gave you the center of my heart
The only one who shines a light on me
If you're leaving for somewhere, no matter what you do
I will be with you, oh, oh, oh
Like a sinking ship out there
I will get to you
Before I'll go sinking too

If you're leaving for somewhere, no matter what you do
I will be with you, oh, oh, oh
Like a sinking ship out there
I will get to you
Before I go sinking too
