Screw the world, Shoot shoot at it
I dot all I want, Why don't you?
Screw the world, Shoot shoot at it
You're the murderer
I know you

I'm a savage, You're a savage
We're a savage bunch
Down from Jupiter and Venus
Where they meet for love
Without you so

Screw the world, Shoot shoot at it
I got all I want, Why don't you?
Screw the world, Shoot shoot at it
You're a murderer
I know you

I'm a savage, You're a savage
We're a savage bunch
Down from Jupiter and Venus
Where they meet for love
Without you so

Screw the world, Shoot shoot at it
I got all I want
Why don't you?
Screw the world, Shoot shoot at it
You're the murderer, I know you
You're the murderer
I watch you
You're the murderer, I tell you
Screw the world
Screw the world
