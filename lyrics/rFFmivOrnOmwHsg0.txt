I got ideas how this planet works,
it gives perspective on all the racist jerks.
Like in the end, they shed imbalance to everything we know.
Some brains are fast, means that some brains are slow.

This is the rational side of me, I guess,
the sense they barely use when playing chess.
Luck's in the end I know there's also the other side of me,
and to me it's an emotional sensibility.

And that's the side of me I turn to
when I think about the world, well,
that's not my cup of tea.
Yeah, it's the side of me I take
that tells me you've got it wrong,
well, how clear we disagree.
You're just a racist clown to me.

I always thought I was a tolerant man,
the kind that'd always try to understand,
but there's a darker force inside of me that wants me to
be as bad and be as sad, sad as you.

And that's the side of me I turn to
when I think about the world, well,
that's not my cup of tea.
Yeah, it's the side of me I take
that tells me you've got it wrong,
well, how clear we disagree.

Yeah, it's the side of me that said
"I would like to kick your head in,
you're so far out at sea".
This state of mind is hard to get through,
makes me hate as much as you do,
it clearly makes me see
you're just a racist clown to me.

You're just a racist clown to me,
you're just a racist clown,
a racist clown to me.
