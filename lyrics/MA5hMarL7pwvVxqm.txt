In this town television shuts off at two
What can a lonely rock and roller do?
Ah, the bed's so big
And the sheets are clean
And your girlfriend said
You were 19
And the styrofoam ice bucket
Is full of ice
Come up to my motel room
Treat me nice
I don't wanna make no late night New York calls
I don't wanna stare at them ugly grass mat walls
Chronologically I know you're young
But when you kissed me in the club
You bit my tongue
I'll write a song for you
I'll put it on my new LP
Ah, come up to my motel room
Sleep with me

Oh, there's a bible in the drawer
Don't be afraid
I'll put up a sign
To warn the cleanup maid
Yeah there's lots of soap
And there's lots of towels
Never mind them desk clerk scowls
I'll buy you breakfast
They'll think you're my wife
Come up to my motel room
Save my life
Come up to my motel room
Save my life
