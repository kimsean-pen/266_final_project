I have been given
One moment from heaven
As I am walking
Surrounded by night

Stars high above me
Make a wish under moonlight
On my way home I remember only good days
I'm on my way home; I can remember every new day

I move in silence
With each step taken
Snow falling 'round me
Like angels in flight

Far in the distance
Is my wish under moonlight
On my way home I remember only good days
On my way home I remember all the best days

I'm on my way home; I can remember every new day
Turn it up! Turn it up! Turn it up, up, up! Adieu...
Turn it up! Turn it up! Turn it up, up, up! Adieu...

On my way home I remember only good days
On my way home I remember only good days
