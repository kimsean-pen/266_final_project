Today I'm gonna ride away
And feel the sun throughout my hair
Finally free to be who I wanna be
Who that is I don't really care

'Cause I have got friends who love me
Blue skies are above me
My blonde hair is everywhere

(sweet sixteen)
Gonna spread my wings
(sweet sixteen)
It's my chance to shine
(sweet sixteen)
Discovering
(sweet sixteen)
So much more in life
(sweet sixteen)

Drivin' down to the club where we go to dance
Radio's blastin' and the top is down
There ain't nothin' in my way
Except the traffic of L.A

And I have got friends who love me
Bright stars shine above me
My blonde hair is everywhere

(sweet sixteen)
Gonna spread my wings
(sweet sixteen)
It's my chance to shine
(sweet sixteen)
Discovering
(sweet sixteen)
So much more in life
(sweet sixteen)

Mamma loves me
And a sister who shows me
And daddy's always there

(sweet sixteen)
Gonna spread my wings
(sweet sixteen)
It's my chance to shine
(sweet sixteen)
Discovering
(sweet sixteen)
So much more in life
(sweet sixteen)

I wanna know what it feels like
I need to see it from the inside
I can taste a bit of what I will find
So much more in life

(sweet sixteen)

I wanna know what it feels like
I need to see it from the inside
I can taste a bit of what i will find
So much more in life

(sweet sixteen)
