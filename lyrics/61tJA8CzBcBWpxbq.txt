Once more in to breaches I cannot gap,
one more chance to second guess your thoughts,
my friends said that you would be a tough nut to crack,
come back let's settle this up...

...and down my spine,
the feint tingle keeps me up at night,
so while you dream i lie awake and look to the stars,
no answers forthcoming i find myself locked in your arms.

Once more into breaches I cannot gap,
one more chance to second guess your thoughts,
my friends said that you would be a tough nut to crack,
come back let's settle this up...

...like earth and dust,
one and the same; insigificant.
But who am i to presume that we are all but done,
perpetually complexing the simple;
I for one am done.

You brought this on yourself,
our problems had enough time on the shelf,
we made the same mistakes,
we lived our lives without the give and the take.
The time we spent apart,
served to remind me of when we talked.
My one and sole regret are the thoughts that went left unsaid.

Once more into breaches I cannot gap
one more chance to second guess your thoughts
my friends said that you would be a tough nut to crack
come back let's settle this up.
