There was light and clear skies
There was hope and endless dreams
There was love and no dying
There were forests as far as I could see

So make me feel like this
The tired and the hurt
The cold and broken seas
And everything we love

There was loss
There was fear
The times saved was all we had in here [?]
The were seasons of cold and dark
Countless losses that we never saw

So make me feel like this
The tired and the hurt
The cold and broken seas
And everything we love

So make me feel like this
The tired and the hurt
The cold and broken seas
And everything we love

So make me feel like this
The tired and the hurt
The cold and broken seas
And everything we love

So make me feel like this
The tired and the hurt
The cold and broken seas
And everything we love
