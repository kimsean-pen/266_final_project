Sight a brand new horizon
Ascending from the hearts of those who couldnt see
The decline of man, the final stage of war

Spectral forces of mankind
Were all trapped inside the core of the machine
Our time has come to find a way back home

We seek our destiny in thee
In the eye of the storm
A genesis is born, reborn

Riders of the storm one with the wind, defenders of creation
Riders of the storm aligned with the sun

Phantom powers rule the earth
Descending down, controling you and me
What is left to see, is it all but a dream

On the inside looking out
Kept within a cage, behind a false facade
They cant keep us down cause our strenght is our will

We dream of a genesis reborn
Where our spirits fly free
Let us choose our own destiny

Riders of the storm one with the wind, defenders of creation
Riders of the storm aligned with the sun

Speak the word of Nemesis
Call for thunder call for rain
Let us meet our Genesis
Save us from the unholy pain

Riders of the storm one with the wind, defenders of creation
Riders of the storm aligned with the sun
