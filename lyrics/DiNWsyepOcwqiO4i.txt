No need to call me friend
I understand what you meant back then
All your times into suspend
Between half-past seven to quarter-past ten
All you need in me to surpass
Negative energies that had you upset
My loving kept your heart in line
Standing on the borderline

(Bridge)
I've got time and you can have it all
(As long as I'm not home too late
We can even catch a movie it starts around 8)
But you're playing games don't think I'll come when you call
Cos I'll be occupied with something else

(Chorus)
One foot in, one foot out
It ain't what I'm all about
Your love has got me spinning around
You take the love outta me
Keeping your distance baby
No more I will resist baby

Not just a fling you see
I'm not your fashion accessory
It's time your started to think of me
Of more than just your girl baby
Have I offended you?
Cos your friends can hear me talking to you
Maybe I've got some things to do
Call you up when I get through

(Bridge)
I've got time and you can have it all
(As long as I'm not home too late
We can even catch a movie it starts around 8)
But you're playing games don't think I'll come when you call
Cos I'll be occupied with something else

(Chorus)
One foot in, one foot out
It ain't what I'm all about
Your love has got me spinning around
You take the love outta me
Keeping your distance baby
No more I will resist baby

(Chorus)
One foot in, one foot out
It ain't what I'm all about
Your love has got me spinning around
You take the love outta me
Keeping your distance baby
No more I will resist baby

(Chorus)
One foot in, one foot out
It ain't what I'm all about
Your love has got me spinning around
You take the love outta me
Keeping your distance baby
No more I will resist baby
