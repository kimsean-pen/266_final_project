Layers of green above
Layers of green
Where is the beginning
Sun rising tries to catch
A glimpse of forest floor
Perched on branch-tip
Ready to jump
Falling through air
Black feathered wings
On sudden sound of wind begin to soar
Transitional bird,
When we hear â€“
We make a listening sound
Moon rising exchanges
Secrets with the leaves
Sitting with you in a tree
In soft rain feeling there's
Time here for everything
