time will have warranted
all that the foliage brung
falls to the ground
at the feet of the old and the young
tired and worn
from a life made of wallow and pain
of what will be made
is all that remains at the core

bear the old and the young
time will habe warranted
all that the foliage brung
bear the old and the young

awoke from a long one
that came on the heels of a day
where sun would arise
and the grant us the kindness of ray
fields full of gladness
surrounded by droves that await
and look for the grave
in everything adorn
