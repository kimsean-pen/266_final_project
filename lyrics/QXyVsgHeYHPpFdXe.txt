I just wish my life could be as strange as a conspiracy
I hold out but there's no way of being what I want to be
Dragons blow fire angels fly spirits wither in the air
I'm just me I can't deny I'm neither here, there nor anywhere

Oh you should see my trail of disgrace,
it's enough to scare the whole human race
Oh you should see my trail of disgrace,
it's enough to scare the whole human race

I don't care about this life, they say there'll be another one
defeatist attitude I know will you be sorry when I've gone
Primitive painters are ships floating on an empty sea
gathering in galleries were stallions of imagery

Oh you should see my trail of disgrace,
it's enough to scare the whole human race
Oh you should see my trail of disgrace,
it's enough to scare the whole human race
