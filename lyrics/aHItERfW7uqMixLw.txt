Tell me babe what's happening
What the fuck is happening
I see it now but I felt it then
I'm alone and you're with him

Tell me babe what's happening
What the fuck is happening
Holding onto things you said
All my love for you is dead

You had to leave me these scars
Oh it's a shame you took it this far
It's over
It's over
It's over
It's over

Still have so much left to say
Why'd we have to leave it this way
Come over
Come over
Come over
Come over

Tell me babe what's happening
What the fuck is happening
I've lost my appetite to live
Not a thing I could forgive

Tell me babe what's happening
What the fuck is happening
I thought you were a gem
Will I ever love again?

You had to leave me these scars
Oh it's a shame you took it this far
It's over
It's over
It's over
It's over

Still have so much left to say
Why'd we have to leave it this way
Come over
Come over
Come over
Come over

What's happening
What's happening
What's happening
