Suddenly you can't get on to me.
Was it wrong for you to belong to me?
Maybe we can find a way.
Everyday is like a dream to me.
You said I need a place to go.
So we said lets go.
I let you by my side.
But you were stircrazy
Looking for the next best thing.
To fight is your escape route, and so is mine.
It was the best thing for you and me to unite.
No matter where we go the winds still blow.
Cause matters of the heart always leave you from the start.
Suddenly you can't get on to me.
Was it wrong for you to belong to me?
Maybe we can find a way.
Everyday is like a dream to me.
Another day, another show.
And the wind just blows, In another life.
You think im crazy cause all I want to do is relive the day that I first met you.
Was right on time, It was a bright day and you were like a heavenly sun.
At the end of our tale, the lonelyness prevails.
Suddenly you can't get on to me.
Was it wrong for you to belong to me?
Maybe we can find a way.
Everyday is like a dream to me.
Its way easy for you and me, love.
It cant hold on, just be who you are.
