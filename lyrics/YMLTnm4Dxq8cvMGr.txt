I could hear them howling from afar,
I saw them rushing to your car...
In a moment all went screaming wild,
until the darkness killed the light...

I remember running to the sea,
the burning houses and the trees...
I remember running to the sea,
alone and blinded by the fear...

And the river flows beneath your skin,
like savage horses kept within...
And all is wasted in the sand,
like breaking diamonds with your hand

I remember running to the sea,
remember falling to my knees...
I remember gliding off the shore,
until I touched the ocean floor...

And the river flows beneath your skin,
like savage horses kept within...
And all is wasted in the sand,
like breaking diamonds with your hand...

And the river grows inside of me...
And the river grows inside of me...
And the river grows inside of me...
And the river grows inside of me...

And the river grows inside of me...
And the river grows inside of me...
