Floating with nowhere to hide
unspoken twist back inside

How did we get here

Life don't belong here

Feel like I just never tried
to find a way back to the outside
it stops me from breathing
kills all the dreaming

Talking to you from the other side of a wall
In my mind and it's clear that you're near to me.
Think i found a way to understand
why i couldn't see what was happening
the fear overcame me.
took a trip on the inside
I took a trip on the inside i try to hold on 'til this feeling Is gone.
break through to the other side need to break through To the other side of everything that is hurting you.

I just can't lay down and die
it takes a lifetime to understand why
it seems that you need me
but you don't seem to hear me...
