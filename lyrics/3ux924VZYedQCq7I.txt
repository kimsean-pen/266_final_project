Tell me about you
Tell me about the life
you want to find out
I hope you don't regret the choice
If there is a moment
you can choose one day

Get up in the morning
Get out of deception
you can not stay here anymore

Get out of that moment
Wake up from the nightmare
you can not stop here anymore

Take off your dress and think
about the way you were last night
Lying on the bed the way you want
Look for the traces in the room

Tell me what you need
I don't have the answer
but I'll help decode it
I hope you don't expect too much
If there is a moment
you can choose one day

Get up in the morning
Get out of deception
you can not stay here anymore

Get out of that moment
Wake up from the nightmare
you can not stop here anymore

Get up in the morning
Try to remember
Nothing you can get
at the fourth floor
Get all right oh oh
Get all right oh oh
You don't have to stay
You don't have to stay

Get up in the morning
Get out of deception
you can not stay here anymore

Get out of that moment
Wake up from the nightmare
you can not stop here anymore

Get up in the morning
Get out of deception
you can not stay here anymore

Get out of that moment
Wake up from the nightmare
you can not stop here anymore
