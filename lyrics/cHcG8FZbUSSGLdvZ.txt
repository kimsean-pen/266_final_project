Change your heart
Look around you
Change your heart
It will astound you

I need your loving
Like the sunshine

And everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Change your heart
Look around you
Change your heart
It will astound you

I need your loving
Mmm like the sunshine

And everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

And everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
