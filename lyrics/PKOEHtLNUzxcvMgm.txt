You keep tryin to get inside my head
while i keep trying to lose the words you said
can't you see i'm hangin by a thread
to my life what i know, yeah i'm losing control and
oh no, my walls are gonna break
so close, its more than i can take
i'm so tired of turning and running away
when love ju--st isn't safe
(your not safe, mm-mm)

i'm strong enough, I've always told myself
i never want to need somebody else
but I've already fallen from that hill
so i'm droppin that guard here's your chance at my heart and

Oh no, my walls are gonna break
so close, its more than i can take
i'm so tired of turning and running away
when love ju-st isn't

everything you want, but its everything you need
its not always happy endings but its hap-py in between
its taken so long, so long to finally see
that your love is worth the risk

Oh no, my walls are gonna breeeaakk
Oh no, my walls are gonna break
so close, its more than i can take
so tired of turning and running away
when love ju-st isn't safe

Oh no, my walls are gonna break
Oh no, my walls are gonna break
so close, its more than i can take
so tired of turning and running away
when love just isn't safe
your not safe
and that's okay
