I think I'm going crazy
You said to leave later
Don't know about you but I can feel it in this room

Let's fall a little deeper
I know you're not a keeper
Don't know about you but I can feel it thru and thru

Don't know about you but I can feel it thru and thru
Don't know about you but I can feel it thru and thru

It's 4 in the morning
You've caught me in a moment
Don't know about you but I can feel it thru and thru

And all of our reason
Lost to deceiving
Ooh I tried to make it thru

Don't know about you but I can feel it thru and thru
Don't know about you but I can feel it thru and thru
Don't know about you but I can feel it thru and thru
Don't know about you but I can feel it thru and thru

Sky's reaching out I want it
To take us back home again
And all of your holding on
it's getting lost in my head

And oh, your love is
All I wanted to save

Don't know about you but I can feel it thru and thru
