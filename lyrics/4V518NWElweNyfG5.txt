sit down and dream about
the way the sun would shine on you
the night falls
oh, so deep and blue

can't see the way
you used to look at me
can't hear your voice
as it used to be
cause it's gone out to sea
it's just a memory

things happen so fast
and i can't keep track
when i'm by myself
i find i'm looking back
on all that's happened to me
it's gone out to sea
it's just a memory
