I thought so much about you that day
It was a perfect day
But I couldn't enjoy it without you
I wish it didn't mean so much
When I grabbed you by the hand
Sometimes I think too much about things
I think I give you too much time
But it feels like
I want to give to something back
For everything you mean to me
I want to give to something back
For everything you mean to me
Chorus:
Jackie Jackie
Spend this winter with me
Oh, Jackie Jackie
I just can't make up your mind
Tonight, tonight we fly
Oh, Jackie Jackie
I still wait by the phone
Oh, Jackie Jackie
I don't wanna be alone
So come along with me tonight
Why do I always end up
How come I don't fall in love
With normal people?
And why don't normal people
Fall in love with me?
I don't think I'm that strange
Do you think I'm strange?
I don't intend to
It's just that things very easily
Get complicated around me
It's just that things very easily
Get complicated around me
(Chorus)
Hey Jackie, please
Come with me
And you'll see
That my love
Will take you high above, baby
(Chorus)
