Defined by status and prosperity
Consumed by rivalry
Absorbed and digested

Desperate measures in times of despair
The elite conducting psychological warfare
Fabrication of scapegoats to lure the prey
Infiltrating the parliament on Election Day
Dissemination of propaganda
Subsidised by corporations
The poor selling their soul
To serve those in control
Xenophobia institutionalised
On behalf of democracy

Defined by status and prosperity
Consumed by rivalry
Absorbed and digested
Human dignity reduced to misery

Easy answers to difficult questions
Divided and conquered in the name of freedom
A mechanism that breeds contradictions
A false and ill-conceived design
Terror reigns
Lifeless bodies scattered on the streets
A season of violence is
Exploiting the weakness
Revolt, resist, destroy the rich
Ability of free thought depleted
Like animals, driven by their instinct
Revolt, resist, destroy the rich
Revolt, resist, destroy the rich

Exercise of power
Indomitable thirst for sadistic torture
Population control in the
Hand of executive forces
Indoctrinated, tormented, beaten to death
Fear feeding fear, conform, survive

Lives erased for wealth and greed
Bringing the end to the human breed
Revolt, resist, destroy the rich
Revolt, resist, destroy the rich
Revolt, resist, destroy the rich
