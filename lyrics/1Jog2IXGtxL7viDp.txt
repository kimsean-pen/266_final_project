I feel my wheels have come undone
I've fallen off my tracks
Lord, I need Your guiding hand
If I'm to make it back, oh, make it back, back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back, oh

All my life, everything's been after me
All my life, I just refused to see
Take me in from the storm, come and rescue me
Under the wings of Mother Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary

Doing wrong is all you know
In the end, do you know where you go?
You can't keep doing what you do
Sooner or later, it all comes back to you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, oh

All my life, everything's been after me
All my life, I just refused to see
Take me in from the storm, come and rescue me
Under the wings of Mother Mary, Mary, yeah

All my life, everything's been after me
All my life, I just refused to see
Take me in from the storm, come and rescue me
Under the wings of Mother Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
