I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go for you, I'll fight
I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight for you, I'll kill
I'll kill, I'll kill, I'll kill for you, I will, I will, I will

I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go for you, I'll fight
I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight for you, I'll die
I'll die, I'll die, I'll die for you, I will, I will, I will

And if I die, I'll die, I'll die alone on some
Forgotten hill, abandoned by the mill
All my blood will spring and spill
I'll thrash the air and then be still

You wake with a start from a dream and know that I am gone
You feel it in your heart, but not for very long
You'll rise each day as planned, your will as your command
And stand each Sunday, a hymnal steady in your hand

And you'll sing to yourself the rising, falling melody
That you could never read without the s lead

Still alone and lost indeed
And your soul will not be free

I will go, I will go, I will go into war's waters, I will wade
And I will know without remorse or regret the fairness of our trade

For you to live, I took your place a deal was made and I was paid
And in gold, as I was told with a place where my body could be laid

You will steer your life and die old, in bed at home surrounded
By your peers, without suffering or fear
Grandchildren far and near, and none will shed a tear
For the love no longer here

I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go for you, I will
I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight for you, I will, I will, I will
I'll kill, I'll kill, I'll kill, I'll kill for you, I will
I'll die, I'll die, I'll die, I'll die for you, I will, I will, I will
And if I die, I'll die, I'll die alone, like Jesus
On the cross, my faith cannot be tossed
My life will not be lost
If my love comes across
