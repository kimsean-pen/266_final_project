The landlord's here to visit
They're blasting disco down below
Says, "I'm doubling up the rent 'cause the building's condemned"
"You're gonna help me buy City Hall"

But we can
You know we can
But we can
You know we can

Let's lynch the landlord man

I tell 'em, "turn on the water"
I tell 'em, "turn on the heat"
Tells me, "All you ever do is complain", yeah
Then they search the place when I'm not here

But we can
You know we can
But we can
You know we can

Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord man

There's rats chewing up the kitchen
Roaches up to my knees
Turn the oven on, it smells like Dachau, yeah
'Til the rain pours through the ceiling

But we can
You know we can
But we can
You know we can

Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord man

The landlord man
