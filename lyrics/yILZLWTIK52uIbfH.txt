It's so divine
To dive and drown
In milk and honey streams
Paralysed
By frantic eyes
Mirrors and the sea

My tender bones
Gently broken by a dose
Of paradise
With lethal skies
With lethal skies
Lethal skies
With lethal skies

It's so surreal
Predictable
Sedating every fool
Sweet and cruel
Reflections in
An unrevealing pool

My tender bones
Gently broken by a dose
Of paradise
With lethal skies
With lethal skies
Lethal skies
With lethal skies

With lethal skies
With lethal skies
With lethal skies
With lethal skies
