How many times have I driven this road
All my way home
It's always the same
So many people just stand in the line
They're chasing the lights
But losing their way
And I find myself looking for you
Yeah, I find myself looking for you, looking for you

The city was on fire for us
We would've died for us
Up in flames
Cue the rain
In my heart little scars everywhere that you are
Up in flames

Cue the rain
Hell lights and till lights they all look the same
We come and we go
It something to chase
Hard to remember what we left behind
But you're hand in mine is hard to erase
And I find myself looking for you

Yeah, I find myself looking for you, looking for you
The city was on fire for us
We would've died for us
Up in flames
Cue the rain
In my heart little scars everywhere that you are
Up in flames

Cue the rain
And I'll stay, yeah, anything but okay

And I'll fade tonight
The city was on fire for us
We would've died for us
Up in flames
Cue the rain

Cue the rain

Why can't I stay?

Save it away
And I find myself looking for you

Yeah, I find myself looking for you
The city was on fire for us
We would've died for us
Up in flames

Cue the rain
In my heart little scars everywhere that you are
Up in flames

Cue the rain
And I'll stay, yeah, anything but okay
And I'm fade tonight
The city was on fire for us
We would've died for us
Up in flames
Cue the rain
