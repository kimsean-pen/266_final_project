There's so much that's now just set in stone
You drew me like only you, you would know

All I have left is what you gave me, you gave me
And I'll clutch it hard, what you gave me, you gave me

You knew me; can you say you knew me?
Oh why kept it all inside
There's so much, there's so much you gave me
Only you and you alone

All I have left is what you gave me, you gave me
And I'll clutch it hard, what you gave me, you gave me

All I have left is what you gave me, you gave me
And I'll clutch it hard, what you gave me, you gave me
