There's never a way, there's never a day
To convince people
You can play their game, you can say their name
But won't convince people

There's several ways, and there's several ways
To convince people
Now you people, and we people, we've got a way
To convince people

It's the name of the game
It's the game of the name
Convincing people
Convincing people

Now there's several ways, and there's several days
To convince people
And there's several ways, there's never a way
To convince people

There's one way though, that you'll never convince people
And that's when you try, to be someone
Who's not telling and who's trying to compel
Who's trying to tell you, what you ought to be convinced of

So there's several ways, and there's several days
To convince your people, and you are the people

Convincing people
Convincing people

There's never a way, and there's never a day
To convince people
There's several ways, and there's several days
We don't want to convince people

We don't want to convince
We don't want to convince people
We don't want to convince, we don't want to convince
We don't want to convince people

Let me tell you what I want
let me tell you what I want
I want you to do
I want you to do

I'll tell you what I want you to do
I'll tell you what I want you to do
I'll tell you what I want you to do

It's no way, no way, it's no way, it's no way
To convince people
