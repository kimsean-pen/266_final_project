Well, I met you at the blood bank, we were looking at the bags
Wondering if any of the colours matched any of the names we knew on the tags
You said: "See, look, that's yours, stacked on top with your brother's
See how they resemble one another even in their plastic little covers"

And I said I know it well

That secret that you knew, but don't know how to tell
It fucks with your honour, and it teases your head
But you know that it's good, girl 'cause it's running you with red

Then the snow started falling, we were stuck out in your car
You were rubbing both of my hands, chewing on a candy bar
You said: "Ain't this just like the present to be showing up like this?"
As a moon waned to crescent, we started to kiss

And I said I know it well

That secret that we know, that we don't know how to tell
I'm in love with your honour, I'm in love with your cheeks
What's that noise up the stairs, babe? Is that Christmas morning creaks?

And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well

And I, I know it well
And I, I know it well
And I, I know it well
And I, I know it well, I know it well
And I, I know it well
