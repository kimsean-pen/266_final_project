Woh ooh woh
I can tell by the look in your eyes you've been hurtin'
You know I'll never let you down, oh no
And I'll try anythin' to keep it workin'
You gave me time to find out
What my heart was lookin' for
And what I'm feelin' inside

In your eyes
I wanna see your love again
In your eyes
I never want this feelin' to end
It took some time to find the light
But now I realize
I can see the Heaven in your eyes

Can't you see I'm findin' it hard to let it go?
Ooh
All the heartaches we've been through
I never really thought I'd see this love grow
But you helped me see
Now I know what my heart's been lookin' for

And what I'm feeling inside
In your eyes
I wanna see your love again
In your eyes
I never want this feelin' to end
It took some time to find the light
But now I realize
I can see the Heaven in your eyes

We've been livin' on the edge
Where only the strong survive
We've been livin' on the edge
And it's somethin' that we just can't hide

Oh this feelin' inside
In your eyes
I wanna see your love again
In your eyes
I never want this feelin' to end
It took some time to find the light
But now I realize
I can see the Heaven in your eyes

Oh yeah, I can see the Heaven in your eyes
Oh yeah, I can see the Heaven in your eyes
(Heaven in your eyes)
I can see the Heaven in your eyes
(Heaven in your eyes)
Heaven in your eyes
(Heaven in your eyes)
Ohh ooo ohh
Heaven in your eyes
(Heaven in your eyes)
I can see the Heaven in your eyes
