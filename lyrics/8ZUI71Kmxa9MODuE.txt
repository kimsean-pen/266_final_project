I want all my tattoos erased
I want a haircut that fits my face
I want a good job that really pays me
So I can finally act my age

I want a big house in the suburbs
I want two kids, one boy, one girl
I wanna wear a suit and tie to work
And on Sundays take my kids to church

I wanna befriend couples and drink wine
But two glasses, not bottles this time
I wanna work out and watch my waistline
Be faithful for my whole life

All I want is to begin again
But now I'm up here on this ledge
I know at times you wanted to kill me
But let me save you the trouble and feel me
