Why?
Ego te absolvo, et anima libera (est)
Why?
Ignis et sanguis in tenebris vivit lux

I am digging in my dark old memories
Sometimes I think it's too late to redeem my soul
Pain and pleasure seem like one damn thing
I can't control my instincts I want more and more
I am lost

Nightmares from my past
This suffering came from the conscience
There's no escape from your penance
The tales of a hero's fate
It's hard to get over mind fields
You can't control inner instincts

Tales of a life full of blood and mistakes
This hero you see is a mask on my face
Shameless hiding
The scars now have taken the place

There's no gain just hate
This suffering came from the conscience
There's no escape from your penance
The tales of a hero's fate
It's hard to get over mind fields
You can't control inner instincts

Vividi sogni di oscure realtà

Mercy and agony: two halves, one burning soul
Hell walks beside me while Heaven sends his calling

The truth is so scary, mean cold and rough
Oh God please forgive me, I did it for love
Save my soul, you omniscient
You know I saved my dove

There's no gain just hate
This suffering came from the conscience
There's no escape from your penance
The tales of a hero's fate
It's hard to get over mind fields
You can't control inner instincts

Vividi sogni di oscure realtà

Mercy and agony: two halves, one burning soul
Hell walks beside me while Heaven sends his calling

Why am I here? Oh, what does this mean?
There's nothing right there's nothing wrong
I'll live forever damned... the tales of a hero's fate

Vividi sogni di oscure realtà

Mercy and agony: two halves, one burning soul
Hell walks beside me while Heaven sends his calling

Why?
Ego te absolvo, et anima libera (est)
Why?
Ignis et sanguis in tenebris vivit lux

In ages past,
the Nephilim Empire ruled the Earth... but they fell from grace
Once their slaves, humanity rose up and defeated their gods
The Nephilim were purged from the Earth and banished to the darkness
For centuries, they watched, and waited...
The Nephilim Empire would one day rise again
And, when they rose from the ashes,
they formed an alliance with a highly-evolved race
Known as the Konstrukts
Together, they wiped out every last remnant of homo-sapiens DNA
Despite the genocide, the dream of humanity would rise... again
Time flows like a river, but there are many streams
The end of flesh is come before me
For the Empire is filled with violence and hatred
Behold I will destroy the empire and those within
I am become death, the destroyer of worlds
