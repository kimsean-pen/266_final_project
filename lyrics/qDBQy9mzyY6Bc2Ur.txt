Can we get real for a moment?
You're my one and only friend

Watch the sunset from your sedan
Let your hand rest on mine

I've lived in every town
But here is where I find home

My mind is open
And my body is yours
Show me the sign
Please

I was so sure, I was faulty
And not able to love
But then you crept up on me
While I was dreaming
Whispered love into my ear

If you're tired
I can drive us
We can go back
To my place

My mind is open
And my body is yours
Show me the sign
Please
