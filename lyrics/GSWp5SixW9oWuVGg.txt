Standing in the gutter
Watch the sun burn all the hours with you
You look right through
Rain causing nostalgia
Only proof it's getting harder with you
I'll wait for you
It's all it ever was
It's all it'll ever be
It's all it'll ever be
It's all I ever wanted
Something to believe in
Changing by the hour
As the stars begin to shower on you
I'm changing too
Waiting this is sour
So my secrets blowing louder on you
I always knew
It's all it ever was
It's all it'll ever be
It's all it'll ever be
It's all I ever wanted
Something to believe in
It's all it ever was
It's all it'll ever be
It's all it'llever be
It's all I ever wanted
Something to believe in
