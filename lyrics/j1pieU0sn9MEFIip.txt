Some men search to find their own
Some men will never find someone
Some men are searching for people in the sky
And some men live in space and time
Some men some will surely
Die, everyone but most
Everyone but most...
Some men live in the past and end
Some men some will only
Cry; everyone but most
Everyone but most

We watched him grow from a little person
And as he grew to a bigger person
He stood above the people
All these little people
And everyone below
They were just little people

Some men never find a home
Some men live alone and
Die and everyone but most
Everyone but...
Everyone but most... will find it in the end
A better place and things to call their own

No we're never gonna change
Never gonna change
Never gonna change
Never gonna change (2x)

Some men some will fade away
Some men some will surely
Die; everyone but most
Everyone but most
Some men some will never try
Some men live alone in time everyone but most
Everyone but...
Everyone but most will find it in the end
A better place and things to call their own
Everyone but most
Will find it in the end
A better place and things to call their own

We watched him grow to a bigger person
And as he grew to a giant person
He stood above the clouds on all these little people
And as we looked above they were just little people...
