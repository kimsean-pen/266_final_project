where are you
where are you
where are you
where are you
in the maw
shattered teeth
underneath a
dripping tongue
i've been waiting
in this silence
while you're sleeping
until you believe
where are you
where are you
in the maw
in a world so dirty
intoxicated
a life of tears
in the maw
a world in a daze
none can be trusted
in the mouth of the beast
i've been waiting
in this silence
while you're sleeping
until you believe
i've been waiting
in this silence
i'm on fire
i'm on fire
