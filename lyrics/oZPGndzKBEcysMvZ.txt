It's gotten late
and now I want to be alone.
All of our friends were here,
they all have gone home.
And here I sit on the front porch,
watching the drunks
stumble forth
into the night.

You gave me a heart attack,
I did not see you there.
I thought you had disappeared
so early
away from here

And this is the chance I never got
to make a move,
but we just talk about
the people we've met in the last five years
and will we remember them in ten more.

I let you bum a smoke,
you quit this winter past.
I've tried twice before, but like this,
it just will not last.
