Meet him by the road.
There's a dog went running,
Picking through spit out leaves
A dog won't even touch.
Meant to shoot that dog long ago,
Just can't leave that dog alone.
Maria carry a rifle.
Maria carry a dog on her back.
That dog is hit again.
That slow dog is hit again,
With his see-thru skin,
The kind of skin you can see through.
He's shot again.
He's shot again.
He's shot a-a-a-a-a-a.
He's shot again.
He's shot again.
He's shot a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a.
Heal me by a river.
Man retires his wife says,
But she was so sad and sick.
His heart breaks in the mud.
Thought I'd leave this world by twenty-one.
Couldn't leave that dog alone.
Maria carry a rifle.
Maria carry a dog on her back.
That dog is hit again.
That slow dog is hit again,
With his see-thru skin,
The kind of skin you can see through.
He's shot again.
He's shot again.
He's shot a-a-a-a-a-a.
He's shot again.
He's shot again.
He's shot a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a.
Maria carry a rifle.
Maria carry a dog on her back.
Maria carry you on her back.
