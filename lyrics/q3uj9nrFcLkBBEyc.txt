Love is a shield to hide behind
Love is a field to grow inside
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning round

Love is a baby in a mother's arms
Love is your breath which makes me warm
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning round

There is a feeling that flows through me
When you are near, you make it real
And we could live for this ideal
And all the pictures we run through
Seem to be perfect, seem to be true

But nothing is quite forever
Especially staying together

Love is a shield to hide behind
Love is a field to grow inside
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning round

Love is a baby in a mother's arms
Love is your breath which makes me warm
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning round

Love is a shield to hide behind
Love is a field to grow inside
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning round

Love is a baby in a mother's arms
Love is your breath which makes me warm
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning round

I don't care now what comes along
What counts is us no matter what will be
Just this naivety
The changing words we're taking in
Seem to be perfect, seem to win

But nothing is quite forever
Especially staying together

Love is a shield to hide behind
Love is a field to grow inside
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning round

Love is a baby in a mother's arms
Love is your breath which makes me warm
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning round
