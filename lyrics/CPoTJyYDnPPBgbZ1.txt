Hi, says the girl with the right eyes
That pairs pretty well when she hits you with the soft smile
You can kind of tell that something's going on, but
She's like a Skrillex song that never drops, she'll never talk
She'll never talk about the feelings that she felt today
Better kept inside of a fence, inside of a cage, inside of a safe
That's safe for her, 'cause they, they just hurt
And she don't know why that God's on dirt

I hope he's trying
She said, she said, she said, she said
She said "I hope he's trying"
"Frank, do you think he's trying?"
Then I said "I don't know"

But I asked her "What's wrong?"
She just nods her head
And then I asked her "What's wrong?"
And she said

He was the picture, perfect person
Loved my mother, oh, so dearly, you could
Feel the love reverberate whenever in our building
If it'd feel the same today, I wish I'd know, but
Sometimes you drive a car and lose control
Into poles, hold me closely
I don't think you should love me
I always feel so lonely, knowing that nothing will ever last forever
Sorry Frank, you're much too late, much too late
Sorry Frank, you're, you're much too late
Much too late

Hi, says the girl who doesn't have time for relationship advice
Rather relationships at all
She holds her breath all day and fucking gasps for air at night
She promised she would love me, but only 'til the morning time
The more that I engage in it, the more that I am mortified
That I'm like every other shitty guy

And then bye
Says the girl who doesn't have time for relationship advice
Rather relationships at all
I asked her "What's wrong?"
I asked her "What's wrong?"

And she said
And she said, she said

He's such a bummy, crusty, cruddy, father
Fucking every girl he takes to coffee
He lied to mom in holy matrimony
Hold me closely
I don't think you should love me
I always feel so lonely, knowing that nothing will ever last forever
Sorry Frank, you're, you're much too late
Much too late

I'm sorry Frank, you're, you're much too late
You're much too late, you're much too
Sorry Frank, you're much too late
Much too
