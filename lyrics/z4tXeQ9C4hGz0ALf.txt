Go!

If you close your eyes, your life, a naked truth revealed
Dreams you never lived and scars never healed (scars never healed)
In the darkness life will take you to the other side
Find me waiting there, you'll see if you just close your eyes
If you just close your eyes
If you just close your eyes

Deceived by my eyes
And all I was told I should see
Opinions not mine
The person they taught me to be
One night in the dark of vision of someone I know
And out of the darkness I heard a voice say "I'm you"

Inside of me a light was turned on
Then I was alive

If you close your eyes, your life a naked truth revealed
Dreams you never lived and scars never healed (scars never healed)
In the darkness life will take you to the other side
Find me waiting there, you'll see if you just close your eyes

Hearts uninspired
Trapped inside somebody's dream
Too close to the fire
Yet cold and so numb with the pain
But the fever has broken, and the river has run to the sea
Washed to the ocean and saved by a voice inside me

Inside of me a light was turned on
Then I was alive

If you close your eyes, your life a naked truth revealed
Dreams you never lived and scars never healed (scars never healed)
In the darkness life will take you to the other side
Find me waiting there, you'll see if you just close your eyes

Never thought I would be here, so high in the air
This was my unanswered prayer
Defined by another, so much wasted time
Out of the darkness, each breath that I take will be mine

If you close your eyes, your life, a naked truth revealed
Dreams you never lived and scars never healed (scars never healed)
In the darkness life will take you to the other side
Find me waiting there, you'll see if you just close your eyes
If you just close your eyes
If you just close your eyes
