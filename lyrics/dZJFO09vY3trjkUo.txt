Everybody in this restaurant
Thinks that I've lost my mind
Could have picked a better time and place
And method to unwind

Freaking out, I spin around
And float back to the pool
Half a planet in between
My broken brain and you

Devin says I'm fine, just play it cool
I'm gonna make it home alive
And now I'm turning inside out
And bugging both my eyes

Spinning out, I freak around
Sink deeper in the pool
Half a planet in between
My broken brain and you

And all I want
Is to be at home with you
Eating tacos and watching
UHF on DVD

And all I want
Is to be at home with you
Eating tacos and watching
UHF on DVD

And all I want
Is to be at home with you
Eating tacos and watching
UHF on DVD
On DVD
