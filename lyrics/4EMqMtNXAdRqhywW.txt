Speak and open up your mind
It's something you should do all the time
Keep exploring, seek and find
You know you might Surprise Yourself

Talk without detain to hold
The doubts that should embrace your hope
The calm and chaos of your soul
You know you might Surprise Yourself

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Take a pen and write this down
Draw something that can't be found
And learn to walk again somehow
You know you might Surprise Yourself

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Lover if you only knew
The times that train has fooled me too
And tears me from a place I know
It helps me to surprise myself
You know you can Surprise Yourself
So let go and Surprise Yourself

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
