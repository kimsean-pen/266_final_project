Maybe someday
Saved by zero
I'll be more together
Stretched by fewer
Thoughts that leave me
Chasing after
My dreams disown me
Loaded with danger
So maybe I'll win
Saved by zero
Maybe I'll win
Saved by zero
Holding onto
Words that teach me
I will conquer
Space around me
So maybe I'll win
Saved by zero
Maybe I'll win
Saved by zero
Maybe I'll win
Saved by zero
Maybe I'll win
Saved by zero
Saved by zero
Saved by zero
So maybe I'll win
Saved by zero
Maybe I'll win
Saved by zero
Maybe I'll win
Saved by zero
Who needs to win
Saved by zero
Saved by zero
Saved by zero
Saved by zero
