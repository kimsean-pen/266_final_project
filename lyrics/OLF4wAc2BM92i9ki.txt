You can't bring us on to look me in the eye though we say goodbye
Loll of floss and T-shirt when we talk anymore
the faders spend on times we meant to take from ourselves
what did I do to trouble you unleft on the shelf

I never thought I'd lose my way over you
What did I do?
You'd never felt that kind of pain that I went through
And now it's coming for you
What will you do?

More than though that come to this it has anyway
why use my time to pine for you every day
something worse.so hard took a heart
something burning us so pride that I've been.
