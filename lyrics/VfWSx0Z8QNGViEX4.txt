This generation
Rules the nation
With version

Music happen to be the food of love
Sounds to really make you rub and scrub
(Dum dum ba dum biddly biddly biddly biddly bum)

I say, pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
It a gonna burn
(Give me music, make me jump and prance)
It a go done
(Give me the music, make me rock in the dance)

It was a cool and lovely breezy afternoon
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
You could feel it 'cause it was the month of June
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
So I left my gate and went out for a walk
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
As I pass the dreadlocks' camp I heard them say
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)

Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
(I say)
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
It a gonna burn
(Give me music, make me jump and prance)
It a go done
(Give me the music, make me rock in the dance)
Dum dum dum ba dum biddly biddly biddly biddly bum

So I stopped to find out what was going on
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
'Cause the spirit of Jah, you know, He leads you on
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
There was a ring of dreads and a session was there in swing
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
You could feel the chill as I seen and heard them say
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)

Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
(I say)
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
It a gonna burn
(Give me music, make me jump and prance)
It a go done
(Give me the music, make me rock in the dance)

'Cause me say listen to the drum, a me say listen to the bass
Give me little music, make me wind up me waist
Me say listen to the drum, a me say listen to the bass
Give me little music, make me wind up me waist

(I say)
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
(I say)
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
It a gonna burn
(Give me music, make me jump and prance)
It a go done
(Give me the music, make me rock in the dance)

You play it on the radio
A so me say, we a go hear it on the stereo
A so me know we a go play it on the disco
A so me say we a go hear it on the stereo

Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
(I say)
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
It a gonna burn
(Give me music, make me jump and prance)
It a go done
(Give me the music, make me rock in the dance)

On the left hand side
(I say)
On the left hand side
(I say)
On the left hand side
On the left hand side
On the left hand side
(I say east, say west, say north and south)
On the left hand side
(This is gonna really make us jump and shout)
On the left hand side
(I say east, say west, say north and south)
On the left hand side
(This is gonna really make us jump and shout)
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
(I say)
Pass the Dutchie
