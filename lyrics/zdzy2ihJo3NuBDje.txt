Baby let's design new comfort
Spread the towel and bring out the lotion
Girl now let's design each other
Close your eyes until the logic's gone
Run away, deeper to see
Run away, deeper to see
Run away, to the sun, to the comfort
Run away, deeper to see
Run away, deep summer sea
Run away, to the sun, to the comfort
Baby here's our times let's do it
You know your psychic love says to comsume it
Syncronize your time in motion
Engineers of this gorgeous song
Run away, deeper to see
Run away, deeper to see
Run away, to the sun, to the comfort
Run away, deeper to see
Run away, deep summer sea
Run away, to the sun, to the comfort
To the comfort
