These days looking sideways
Sadness, not from heartache
Cold shoulder, the way you look at
Me, me, me, me
I'm losing my axis
Looking at the recess
This pressure, the way you look at
Me, me, me, me

They say don't even try to resist
Look at what you've been given
Be grateful and don't take the piss
When the people on TV
They all look the same
I know I can do
I can do better than them

When you're down, feeling low
Just remember your name
They ain't us
They ain't us, baby
'Cause you know what they don't
Just remember your name
They ain't us
They ain't us, baby

(They flicker, flicker, flicker)
But they ain't gonna shine like us
(They flicker, flicker, flicker)
Nobody gonna shine like us
(They flicker, flicker, flicker)
But they ain't gonna shine like us
Nobody gonna shine like you and me

Back then didn't notice
They called it subversive
No longer withheld by what you think of me

They say don't even try to resist
Look at what you've been given
Be grateful and don't take the piss
When the people on TV
They all look the same
I know I can do
I can do better than them

When you're down, feeling low
Just remember your name
They ain't us
They ain't us, baby
'Cause you know what they don't
Just remember your name
They ain't us
They ain't us, baby

(They flicker, flicker, flicker)
But they ain't gonna shine like us
(They flicker, flicker, flicker)
Nobody gonna shine like us
(They flicker, flicker, flicker)
But they ain't gonna shine like us
Nobody gonna shine like you and me

(They flicker, flicker, flicker)
Well they ain't no sun
(They flicker, flicker, flicker)
Well they ain't no flame
(They flicker, flicker, flicker)
We are not the same
No, no, no, no
When you're feeling down

When you're down, feeling low
Just remember your name
They ain't us
They ain't us, baby
'Cause you know what they don't
Just remember your name
They ain't us
They ain't us, baby

(They flicker, flicker, flicker)
But they ain't gonna shine like us
(They flicker, flicker, flicker)
Nobody gonna shine like us
(They flicker, flicker, flicker)
But they ain't gonna shine like us
Nobody gonna shine like you and me
