breaking my way through the thorns
this beating hart has never been so warm
hanging roses around my neck
cuse in this life we will never know what to expect
but yeah we are acting like fools
not too con sernerd about what we'll do
dear lover
i miss you where ever you go I'll alway
be with you dear loverdont you worry

when you fined your way
im holding you in my mind

what you feel in your hart
and now we are acting likefools not to conserned

dear love
i miss you
where ever you go
