We never seem
To listen to the music
The radio plays
The songs never stick
I know we're so
Distracted by our endless
Conversations in the basement
They're truly the best connection
I hope they never end (They never end)

You're everything I know
I always knew you'd be
You make me feel at home
When I'm about to leave
We sleep in separated beds
But nevertheless will that keep me
From losing you again

These bottles
I tend to chug the liquid
The minute I wake up
You're so far away
But once the buzz kicks in
You're right there in my brain

Human interaction
I am terrible at
I feel perfectly content
With my best friend
Inside my head (Inside my head)

You're everything I know
I always knew you'd be
You make me feel at home
When I'm about to leave
The ice in my drink
Slowly melting
Water down my cheap whiskey

I am better off being alone
(Swallow this down)
I'll swallow this down nice and slow
(The world's too)
The world's too big for a guy like me
(To climb in to)
To climb in to and be somebody

I am happy
Look in my eyes
I will never blink

I am happy
Look in my eyes
I will never
