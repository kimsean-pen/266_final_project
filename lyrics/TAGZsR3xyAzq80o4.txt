Fuck all that bullshit!

You watch me play
I look away
Your lights turn bright
You found the light

Take, off in space
You and I
Take, off in space
You and I

You're gonna die!
Wanna meet me, why?
I wish I had your strength
Inside your soul escapes

Take, off in space
You and I
Take, off in space
You and I

Cry, into me
Give me
Something
Alright!
The kids that die
Listening to me
You are alive!

Time for change
You and I stay
Take, off in space
You and I
Take, off in space
You and I
I, I, I...
