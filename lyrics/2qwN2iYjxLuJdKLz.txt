Hot on the run from the grip of the power game
The man who leads the way
The man who leads the way
Shell in it's box from his home that they'll never tame
The man who leads the way
The man who leads the way

He is burning
Burning in the twilight
He is turning, burning to face us
He is burning
Fire in the twilight
He is turning, burning to lead us away, away, away

Lead us away, away, away

Taking a break from the role of the everyday boy
The man who leads the way
The man who leads the way
Is he for real or is he back to the old way boy
Can he lead the way, oh can he lead the way?

He's searching, but he's lonely, and he's hurting, but he's only
Waiting for a chance just in time to live a life
Does he need ya, does he want ya?
Does he listen to what you say?
Is he only waiting for the simple way?

He is burning
Burning in the twilight
He is turning, burning to face us
He is burning
Fire in the twilight
He is turning, burning to lead us away, away, away
Hoo would you lead us away, away, away

He's searching, but he's lonely, and he's hurting, but he's only
Waiting for a chance just in time to live a life
Does he need ya, does he want ya?
Does he listen to what you say?
Is he only waiting for the simple way?

He is burning
Burning in the twilight
He is turning, burning to face us
He is burning
Fire in the twilight
He is turning, burning to lead us away, away, away
He is burning
Burning in the twilight
He is burning (Ho no)
The fire...
