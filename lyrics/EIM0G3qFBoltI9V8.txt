Splintered piece of glass falls in the seat and gets caught
These broken windows, open locks, reminders of the youth we lost
In trying so hard to look away from you
We followed white lines to the sunset
I crash my car everyday the same way

Time to let this pass
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)
Time runs through our veins
(it starts and stops and starts and stops again)
We don't stand a chance in this threadbare time
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)
Time to let this pass
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)

Staring at the setting sun
No reason to come back again
The twlight world in blue and white
The needle and the damage done

I don't want to feel this way forever
A dead letter marked return to sender

Broken watch you gave me turns into compass
It's two hands still point to the same time 12: 03, our last goodbye

So push the seats back a little further
I can see the headlights coming
So push the seats back a little further
Roll the windows down and take a breath
I can see the headlights coming
They paint the world in red and broken glass

Time to let this pass
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)
Time runs through our veins
(it starts and stops and starts and stops again)
We don't stand a chance in this threadbare time
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)
Time to let this pass
(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)

Staring at the setting sun
No reason to come back again
The twlight world in blue and white
The needle and the damage done

I don't want to feel this way forever
A dead letter marked return to sender

The spinning hubcaps set the tempo for the music of a broken window
With the cameras on the cameras click
We open up the lens and can't stop

Staring at the setting sun
No reason to come back again
The twlight world in blue and white
The needle and the damage done

I don't want to feel this way forever

When the lights are on the cameras click
We open up the lens to broken glass
(and it's over in a flash)

Staring at the setting sun
No reason to come back again
The twlight world in blue and white
The needle and the damage done

I don't want to feel this way forever
A dead letter marked return to sender

(I'll never understand,
Understanding in a car crash)

In a crash
