You know you could've been a wonder
Takin' your circus to the sky-y-y
You couldn't take it on the tight rope
No, you had to take it on the si-i-ide
You always like it undercover
Tucked in between your dirty shee-ee-eets
But no one's even done nuttin' to ya
And I'm between the hollers and the screa-ea-eams

And I said, "nah nah, hey hey"
Another dirty bird, ain't givin' out a taste, taste
Well, in the black of the night 'till the red morning light

You got your cozy little corner
All night you're jammin' on your fee-ee-eet
Hangin' out just like a street sign
And put a twenty dollar tri-i-ick
I hear you're blowin' like a feather
And then they rub it in your fa-a-ace
Oh, once they've had all their fun, hun
You're at the bottom of the ca-a-age

And I said, "nah nah, hey hey"
Another dirty bird, ain't giving out a taste, taste
In the black of the night 'till the red morning light
And I said, "nah nah, hey hey"
You're givin' all your cinnamon away-ay
That's not right

Hey hey, another dirty bird, ain't givin' out a taste
Uh hey, keep on givin' away and givin' it away, givin' it away
Hey hey, you're givin' all your cinnamon away-ay
Hey hey, you're givin' all your cinnamon away

Ah, hey hey
Another dirty bird, ain't giving out a taste, taste
In the black of the night 'till the red morning light
And I said, "nah nah, hey hey"
You're givin' all your cinnamon away
That's not right, aow
Come on
And I said, "nah nah, hey hey"
Another dirty bird, ain't giving out a taste, taste
In the black of the night till the red morning light
And I said, "nah nah, hey hey"
You're givin' all your cinnamon away-ay
