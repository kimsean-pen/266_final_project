So don't grip, you're choking
What life was trying to
Lift up the rage from a season of play

I don't blame my messes on you
Don't beat this down dead
Sink to a level that is low, low

Why not, what else is
Low, low
Why take the conscience
Low, low
Why not, who else is
Low, low
Why not, what else is there

I climb into
Recognize I don't have the time
What else was said about this man?
What was said

Don't

So don't grip, you're choking
What life was trying to
Lift up the rage from a season of play

I don't blame my messes on you
Don't beat this down dead
Sink to a level that is low, low
Low

Don't hate
Trust in me
No more
