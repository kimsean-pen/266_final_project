I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan, an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music
Told me she was goin' back into usin' again
I said "Wait, first try this hallucinogen"
"It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin"
"Come here, let's go in here"
"Who's in the den?"
"It's me and Kelly!"
"My bad, let's try another room"
"I don't trust you!"
"Shut up slut! Chew up this mushroom"
"This'll help you get in touch with your roots"

"We'll get barefoot, buttnaked, and run in the woods"

"Oh hell, I might as well try 'em, this party is so drag"

"Oh, dag! I didn't mean for you to eat the whole bag!"

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world

But now you're sitting in the corner crying

And now it's my fault, my fault
"I'm sorry!"

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world

But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

"Yo Sue!"
"Get away from me! I don't know you!"
"Oh, shoot!"
"She's tripping"
"I need to go puke"
"I wasn't trying to turn this into something major"
"I just wanted to make you appreciate nature"

"Susan, stop crying, I don't hate ya"
"The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya"
"So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth"

"That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out"
She said "Help me, I think I'm having a seizure!"
I said "I'm high too, bitch! Quit grabbing my t-shirt!"

"Will you calm down? You're starting to scare me"

She said "I'm 26 years old and I'm not married!"
"I don't even have any kids and I can't cook!"

"I'm over here Sue, you're talking to the plant, look"

"We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late"
"'Cause I've never seen no one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate"

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl

I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
"It was an accident!"

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world

But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

"Susan! Where you going, you better be careful"
"Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of getting my hair pulled!"

"I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue"
"Want some gum? Put down the scissors before you do something dumb"
"I'll be right back, just chill, baby, please?"
"I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these"

"John! Where's Dave at before I bash you"
"He's in the bathroom, I think he's taking a crap, dude"
"Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance"
"There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, chopping her hair off"
"And there's only two days left of spring break, how long does it take for these things to wear off?"

"Well, it depends on how many you had"
"I took three, she eat the other twentytwo caps"
"Now she's upstairs crying out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol"
"She's gonna die, dude!"

"I know! And it's my fault!"

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
"I'm sorry!"
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
"What did I do?!"
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

My God, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!
Susan, please wake up!
Please!
Please wake up!
What are you doing?!
You're not dead!
You're not dead!
I know you're not dead...
Wake up...
Susan, wake up...
Oh my God...
