Two sided heart pushing to face
Another walk from the start
Shifting my soul to what was heaven before and now's just a stain, a novelty no more
Passion and soul together deceiving my brain and I fall

But soon they will fade delighted by something else and now I rewind, one more time
Waiting for

All my feelings now in vain
The Divided Heart!

Tearing me apart

The divided heart
Playing it's game for all these wasted years
I have been walking alone
All these years I have been carried away - carried away
Your blood is mine, the shivers it's sending me just right through my spine

Are gonna crawl, splitting my heart in two and haunting my soul - illusionned no more
Passion and soul together deceiving my brain and i fall

But soon they will fade delighted by something else and now I rewind, one more time
Waiting for all lights to fade away, all my feelings now in vain

The Divided Heart!

Tearing me apart
The divided heart
Playing it's game for all these wasted years
I have been walking alone
All these years I have been carried away - carried away

Tearing me apart
The divided heart
Playing it's game for all these wasted years
I have been walking alone
All these years I have been carried away - carried away
The tears that i don't cry won't fill my eyes but pain inside I feel is real
Pain is real until the day I'll die
The divided heart
Tearing me apart
The divided heart
Playing it's game for all these wasted years
I have been walking alone
All these years I have been carried away - carried away
