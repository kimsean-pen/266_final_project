Go Jack-rabbit running through the wood
You had a good night and you feel real loose
Heard they got you going round the goose creek shed
Trying to fill your belly full of buckshot lead

Go Jack-rabbit get the cabbage patch
Farmer left the back porch door on the latch
Heard you coming and he got his gun
You better go Jack-rabbit better start to run

Go Jack-rabbit running through the wood
You had a good night and you feel real loose
Gunfire breaking up the peaceful night
Jack-rabbit lying in the cold daylight

Go Jack-rabbit running through the wood
You had a good night and you feel real loose
Heard they got you going round the goose creek shed
Trying to fill your belly full of buckshot lead

Go Jack-rabbit get the cabbage patch
Farmer left the back porch door on the latch
Heard you coming and he got his gun
You better go Jack-rabbit better start to run

Go Jack-rabbit running through the wood
You had a good night and you feel real loose
Gunfire breaking up the peaceful night
Jack-rabbit lying in the cold daylight
