Only Rasta can liberate the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute, they don't like you

Why try to make I unhappy
Really I don't know
If it was up to them my friend
We would never see the sun nor the snow
Through that mystical communication within
We keep on coming together
I love to see brothers and sisters
Looking out for one another
That's the way it should be
Not contrary, stop tearing down each other

Only Rasta free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe one minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute that they are with you

Hard drugs won't do
You're just behaving like they want you to
Arrogance is much different from ignorance
And I know you feel the same way too
Many live this life without having a clue
No reason why they are so sad and blue
Places to go so much things to do
Not a moment to reflect on the cycle of life

A who free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe one minute, they don't like you

It hard, it hard, it hard
Mek them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard
Let them know
Let them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard
Let them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard
Oh God, we waan go home!

Only Rasta free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Those over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't their believe one minute they don't like you

Why try to make I unhappy
Really I don't know
If it was up to them my friend
We would never see the sun nor the snow
Through that mystical communication within
We keep on coming together
And I love to see brothers and sisters
Looking out for one another
That's the way it should be
Not contrary, stop tearing down each other

Look around who free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute they don't like you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't their believe one minute they don't like you...
