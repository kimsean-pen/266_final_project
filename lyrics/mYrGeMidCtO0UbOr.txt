This is my least favorite life
The one where you fly and I don't
The kiss holds a million deceits
And a lifetime goes up in smoke

This is my least favorite you
Who floats far above earth and stone
The nights that I twist on the rack
Is the time that I feel most at home
We wandering in the shade
And the rustle of falling leaves
A bird on the edge of a blade
Lost now forever, my love, in a sweet memory

The station rolls away from the train
The blue pulls away from the sky
The whisper of two broken wings
May be they're yours, maybe they're mine

This is my least favorite life
The one where I am out of my mind
The one where you're just out of reach
The one where I stand, and you fly

I am wandering in the shade
And the rustle of fallen leaves
A bird on the edge of a blade
Lost now forever, my love, in a sweet memory
