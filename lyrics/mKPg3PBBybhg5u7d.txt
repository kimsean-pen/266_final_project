Thank you,
forever,
for the things you've done...

Nothing
could be better,
than to say it...

Thank you,
forever,
for the things we are...

Nothing
is so easy
as they say it is...

So, thank you
my brother
for the things you've done...

Knowing
you'll never walk away
like I did,
you know...

Thank you,
forever,
for the things we are...

Noone
can see inside of me
like you do...

Thank you,
for the hours
in the orange sky.

Brother,
you will always be
a part of me...

And thank you
for the courage,
when I go too far...

Knowing
you'll never walk away,
like I did...
You know...
