You got a sex siren in your face

Make me scream his name and give me the right aim
Boy can you tame these goodies

Ah
Come here for a minute let me taste you baby
Light your fuse
My brain had you going insane
But my dynamite stick known to drive shit crazy baby
And while you laying on your bed with your feet up
Right there in my wife beater
She like the way I eat her, beat her, beat her
Treat her like an animal somebody call PETA
Put a little bit of this inside a margarita
Then put the bank in her have her running like a meter
On the camp in the city where the girls all pretty
Find me in the club where the girls getting busy
With a flash and the fat booty nice shaped titties
My wrist so full you could ice skate with it
Give it to you till you curling your toes
Get your ass get your clothes
Sit back get the whole exposure
Give it to you

Baby make me

Not to slow not to quick
Baby make me tick tick boom
