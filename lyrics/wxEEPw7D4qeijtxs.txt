Waking up and the bed was made
No one looked me in the eye
The more I try, the more I cry
And it's all for the best

Watch my brother
Cutting grass outside
Sitting on the porch he told me
"It's a long way to go
Before we can rest
And it's all for the best"

You're so beautiful it seems
On a lonely, lazy morning
And when I see you rocking back and forth
Whispering that it's all for the best

One day the stone will roll away
And soon you'll see
You're far away from home but never far away from me
And that's all for the best

Promise me son not to do the things I've done
And walk away from trouble
Promise me son not to do the things I've done
And walk away from trouble

Say you love me
Say you love me
Say you love me
Say you love me
Say you love me
Say you love me
Let's just say you love me
