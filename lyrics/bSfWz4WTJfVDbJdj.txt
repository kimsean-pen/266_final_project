I can feel it in my bones, in my bones
Hear it rumble like a drum, like a drum
Like a vapor in the wind, in the wind
You never see us creeping in, creeping in

Oh my my, oh my my
You never stood a chance
You never stood a chance
Oh my my, oh my my
You're in over your head
You're in over your head

Like a letter printed in red, printed in red
There's a price up on your head, on your head
Devils got you on the run, on the run
But you can't hide once it's begun, it's begun

Ready or not, here we come
Ready or not, here we come
Ready or not, here we come
Ready or not, here we come

Oh my my, oh my my
You never stood a chance
You never stood a chance
Oh my my, oh my my
You're in over your head
You're in over your head

Oh my my, oh my my
You never stood a chance
You never stood a chance
Oh my my, oh my my
You're in over your head
You're in over your head
