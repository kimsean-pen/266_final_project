Pellet snow takes me over
If you need, we'll talk and hold
Dyed your hair and the smell of pot
I hate it but I'll let it slide
Sinking forward to the lions
They're feasting on your favorite child
It isn't fair, the case is closed
And it gets worse, but I've been

Trained, conditioned and
Framed, you know this pageant's
Staged, oh miss voilà
Shamed, you've come to face your flaws
On the centerfold
On the centerfold

The city fines and you are broke
You taste falafel on your coat
Wipe it down and now it's soaked
So hang it up and let it slide
When you fail, you just come home
And kiss your mom, well, life sustains
You're unconditionally praised
With vicious words, but I've been

Trained, conditioned and
Framed, you know this pageant's
Staged, oh miss voilà
Shamed, you've come to face your flaws
On the centerfold
On the centerfold

But you can bet it all on the centerfold
Journalistic rise and without a sound
I don't think it's wise to get out and down
And you can bet it all on the centerfold
On the centerfold
On the centerfold

'Cause I've been
Trained, conditioned and
Framed, you know this pageant's
Staged, oh miss voilà
Shamed, you've come to face your flaws
On the centerfold
On the centerfold
On the centerfold
On the centerfold
