She's a bird, she's a sidewinder
Just hold on, we're in this together
Like a ghost, like a vampire
Hey spirit, can I take you home?

Survive, overdrive
A thousand teeth of a thousand voices
When the sun goes down, it goes on and on
(On and on and on and on and...)

Enter the night through the eye of the storm
This dark machine, an impossible hero
Hey starlight, yo battle bird
Only in dreams can I take you home

Survive, overdrive
A thousand teeth of a thousand voices
When the sun goes down, it goes on and on
(On and on and on and on and...)

Hold it, Hell's right here
My fingers, slip the controls I steer
As the blood, eyes, hope dies
A thousand ways to overdrive, go

Drive, push, harder
Drive, push, harder

Hold it, Hell's right here
My fingers, slip the controls I steer
As the blood, eyes, hope dies
A thousand ways to overdrive
