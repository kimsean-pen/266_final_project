Where did the summer go
I found it in Monaco
Dancing in Mexico
Sushi in Tokyo
I wanna be where you are
Driving a classic car
Cuba is not so far
I can bring my guitar

Baby are we there yet?
Meet me at the sunset
Summer will be over soon
I'll see you when you get there
But until we get there
We'll be howling at the moon

Baby are we there yet?
Meet me at the sunset
Summer will be over soon
I'll see you when you get there
But until we get there
We'll be howling at the moon

Awooooh
Howling at the moon
Awooooh
Howling at the moon

Where is the summertime
Take me back to Hawaii
Skyscrapers in Dubai
Palaces in Versailles
So won't you fly with me
Have dinner in Sicily
Be who you wanna be
Right where you wanna be

Baby are we there yet?
Meet me at the sunset
Summer will be over soon
I'll see you when you get there
But until we get there
We'll be howling at the moon

Baby are we there yet?
Meet me at the sunset
Summer will be over soon
I'll see you when you get there
But until we get there
We'll be howling at the moon

Baby are we there yet?
Meet me at the sunset
Summer will be over soon
I'll see you when you get there
But until we get there
We'll be howling at the moon

Awooooh
Howling at the moon
Awooooh
Howling at the moon

Howling at the moon
Awooooh
Howling at the moon
