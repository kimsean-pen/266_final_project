I call to the Green Mountain State
I call to the silence you make
Do you live inside outside me
As you speak through ten thousand leaves

There's a way There's a way It has all ways,
Always In the house way down by the lake
A story told in a mystic way
Those roads they roam through big fields
Those roads my heart they come steal
Come steal

There's a way There's a way It has all ways,
Always
It has all ways

I call to the letters in leaves
I call to the ones we don't see
My song is born of the wind
No end nowhere to begin

There's a way There's a way There's a way It has all ways,
Always
