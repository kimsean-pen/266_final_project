Summer is here
We've got six long whole weeks
And so we find ourselves
Living the stuff of dreams

We are young
We've got it all going on
But one kid's primal roar
Is another man's din
We're tuning up and plugging in

Come on make some noise
We're going to crank it up
'Cos it makes you feel good
Come on make some noise

Sam, Ian and me
Chasing adolescent dreams
(baked beans and soda streams)
We sound so rough
But it feels so good

Come on make some noise
We're going to crank it up
Going to make you feel good
Come on make some noise

Come on make some noise
We're going to crank it up
To make you feel good
We're gonna go insane
Going out of our brains

We're gonna crank it up
To give you our love
Come on make some noise
Gimme some noise
