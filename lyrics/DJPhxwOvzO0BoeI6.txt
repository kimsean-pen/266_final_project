Blues keep falling down on me
Like rain upon a summer day
No good reason
To be living
Been looking high and low

Always sing the same sad song
No wonder that I feel this way
To me, living's
To be laughing
In satisfaction's face

Wish I was a settin' sun
On a rocky mountainside
Feeling golden
Burning crimson
Till the darkness falls

Wish I was a snow-white moon
I'd float the blackest skies
Bein' silent
Bein' silver
Until the break of day
