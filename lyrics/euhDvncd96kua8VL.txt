God is good and fate is great
When it feels so strong it's hard to wait
You never know how it might unfold
Hearts to break and bodies to hold
Time will tell but it never gets old

Like I told you I'm in for the long, long

Had to have been one of those things
That took place in outer space
A match made in heaven
Not a scratch on her face
Angels must have smoked some dust
Singing songs about in God we trust
Some things slide but this is a must

Like I told you there is a time for finding out

People try to tell me what not to do
They shouldn't make it with a younger girl
And too many chances for the foot to drop
I tried to tell them that I found a pearl
Well

Like I told you be careful what your asking for

Hey sister brutus
You got a mess of a better hand
Hey sister judas
Even you never had my back

She was the cutest thing that I ever did see
A drink in her hand and I don't mean tea
She was with a dude but I just didn't care
Had to find out these moments of air
And Stevie said all is fair

Like I told you there is something for everyone

Well I guess I never told you some things
That I really really wanted to say
And
Did I do everything I could do
Or did the mice just need to flee
And

Like I told you there is more than meets the eye

Hey sister brutus
You got a mess of a better hand
I said hey sister judas
Even you never had my back

I'm not trying to point fingers at you
I'm not trying to lay any blame
But when it comes to the punishment
Girl you know how to bring the pain

Like I told you I'd do it all again

Hey sister brutus
I got a mess of a better hand
I said hey sister judas
Even you never had my back

Hey sister brutus
There's a fury to the woman's land
Hey sister judas
Even you never had my back
