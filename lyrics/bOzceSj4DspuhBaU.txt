Oh sugar, oh sugar can't you see
How hard I'm trying?
You know you gotta, you know you gotta eventually
Make up your mind
'Cause no one's gonna find you
When you're hiding in the dark
No one's gonna find you
When you're hiding in the dark
No one's gonna find you
When you're hiding in the dark
No one's gonna find you
So won't you, so won't you talk to me?
It's time to decide
'Cause no one's gonna save you
If you don't swim for the boat
No one's gonna save you
If you won't take the rope
No one's gonna find you
When you're hiding in the dark
No one's gonna find you
And it's end love, the sky is falling
End love, the sky is falling
The sky is falling
So sugar, so sugar dance with me
This one last time
We got no reason, we got no reason I can see
To hold back tonight
'Cause no one's gonna catch you
If you can't just let go
No one's gonna love you
If you can't let love show
No one's gonna find you
When you're hiding in the dark
No one's gonna find you
And it's end love, the sky is falling
End love, the sky is falling
The sky is falling
Oh sugar, oh sugar can't you see
How hard I'm trying?
You know you gotta, you know you gotta eventually
Make up your mind (You gotta make up your mind)
And it's end love, the sky is falling
End love, the sky is falling
The sky is falling
End love, the sky is falling
End love, the sky is falling
End love, the sky is, the sky is falling
End love, the sky is, the sky is falling
