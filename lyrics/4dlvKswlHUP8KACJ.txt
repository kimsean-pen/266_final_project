Every time you wake up
Too gone to see

Every time you come down
So far from me
From me...

Next time when you wake up
You're lost at sea

I just watch you sink down
You fade away from me
From me...

Where do you go
When the life slips from your eyes?

I'll never know
Why you smiled and waved goodbye,
Goodbye...

Where do you go
When the life slips from your eyes?

I'll never know
Why you smiled and waved goodbye,
Goodbye...
