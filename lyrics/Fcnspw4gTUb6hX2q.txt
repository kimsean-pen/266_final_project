at least don't break, until we descend

To peace talks, full of remorse
but the keeper tends to remain aloof

They know what we'll lose, they know what they'll lose
such unspeakable ruin, now that what will we do?

Liasons, falling in toe, this blinding forest wont bloody unfold

and they know what we'll lose, they know what they'll lose
such unspeakable ruin, now that what will we do?

the panic of this solitude is calling out until

the panic of this solitude is calling out

Forgettable, peccable,
Just get 'em all, peccable, just.

With gratitude and fortitude we credit your enlightenment,
the panic of this solitude is calling out until

with gratitude and fortitude
we credit your [x5]

they know what we'll lose,
they know what they'll lose
Such unspeakable ruin
What will we do?

Just get 'em all
Peccable.
Just. [x4]
