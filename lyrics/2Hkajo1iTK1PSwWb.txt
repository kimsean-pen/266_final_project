You make yourself a prisoner of me
You blind yourself, so you don't have to see
You turn your life, to a power above
You make yourself
A Hostage Of Love

You turn from me, you turn from the strain
Devote yourself to the power again
Distance yourself from all that we vow
You broke those rules
You're my hostage now

I am a sinner and I am a saint
I am a devil
I am a ghost at the wake
God feed the swell and pull
Of your tears as they break
I am the limit of
The load you can take

You are the pulley
And I am the winch
I am salvation
And your herald of sin
I take you beyond
Your limits of trust
Ransom yourself
Hostage Of Love

You see we've have been born again
Since you slept there in that liar's den, den
You cannot be saved
You gave your innocence away
Oooohhh

I turn my cheek
And I've suffered the blow
Truth of my story
Is widely unknown
Words of derision I have
Swallowed with a smile
For telling my story I've been crucified

Now like a madman
I give my laurels to you
Like a hero
Forsake my trophies for you
Though a deciple of this devil
That is in the blood
Am I not also
Your Hostage of Love?

You see we've been born again
Since you slept there in that liar's den, den
You cannot return
Until your innocence is earned

And you seak up to live alone
Though it hurts to make it on your own, own
You cannot be saved
You gave your innocence away
Oooohhh

You will remain a hostage of love
Hostage Of Love
Hostage Of Love
