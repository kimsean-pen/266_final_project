I am one with the world tonight
I am proud to be this far from you

You say that you have no regrets
But I know that you do
You told me someone stole the eye
I know him too

I've come to the conclusion, yes I know
That between black and white
There is no room for two

The scale might be wide
But there's no need to be blind
Between black and white
There is no room for two

I leave all the gray behind
I see clear, I know that I'll find

You claim that you are innocent
But tell me who ain't
You think that you're gonna be saved
There's no such thing as a saint

I've come to the conclusion, yes I know
That between black and white
There is no room for two

The scale might be wide
But there's no need to be blind
Between black and white
There is no room for two

Black and white
There's nothing in between
Black and white
Nothing's what it seems

I've come to the conclusion, yes I know
That between black and white
There is no room for two

The scale makes it wide
But there's no need to be blind
Between black and white
There is no room for two
