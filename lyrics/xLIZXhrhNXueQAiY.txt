As the spring is made alive the winter dies
And the final cries of creatures are long behind
And full of spirit the village starts again
With one more year for a man to change his ways

I used to feel things around me stir,
Grateful for all I received,
Taking in the sounds and ways of creatures upon the Earth
Great were the rivers I swam waning out the sun

As the winter dies the Earth is brought to life
And a thousand merchant ships sail to find
A worthy village to land and start again
With one more year for a man to change his ways

I used to feel things around me stir,
Grateful for all I received,
Taking in the sounds and ways of creatures upon the Earth
Great were the rivers I swam waning out the sun

I used to feel things around me stir
And hear the sounds of creatures upon the Earth
Grateful for all I received
Through the winter cold and spring
