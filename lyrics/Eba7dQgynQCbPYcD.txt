This house of pain is where I live
blood sweat and tears are all I give
you'll never break me down no
never ever
a time of sacrifice you see
you live to take it all from me
I'll never be controlled no
never ever
our time is running out

our time is running out
as the beat of this heart keeps racing
the thunder before the storm
and the tick of this clock keeps breaking
the calm before all explodes

To understand's to walk these days
and nights in shoes imprisoning me
You'll never see inside no
never ever
the dancing face of jealousy
the ups and downs are where you breathe
respecting all we vowed that day
never ever
our time is running out

our time is running out
as the beat of this heart keeps racing
the thunder before the storm
and the tick of this clock keeps breaking
the calm before all explodes

Pacing, Now doubt it's breaking
this pill we're taking
to make this go away
conflict inside of chaos
remaining blameless
beneath the skin the abyss
