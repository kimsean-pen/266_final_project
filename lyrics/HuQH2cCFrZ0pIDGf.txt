Wasteful season take my hand
Take the place of the snakes who ran

Savage things wash over me
A crime that leaves a heated greed
Oh Machine, Machine
I washed it for you
Machine, Machine
I waste it for you

And I walk
And I walk
A space left for two
And I wait
And I wait
To wake next to you
And I walk
And I walk
A space left for two
And I wait
And I wait
To wake next to you

Oh Machine, Machine
I waste it for you
Machine, Machine
I waste it for you
HAH!

Oh Machine, Machine
I washed it for you
