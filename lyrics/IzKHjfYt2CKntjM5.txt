so much for the light show
pissing on while pissing off
sucking in a smokescreen
selling of a loose knit dream

folding up the skyline
agreeing on a steep decline
cant control this airplane
being caught is just the same
headed for a lowlife
little lover's so polite
waking up the core needs
with smelling salts and faulty means

did the bones collide
who let the bones collide
why did the bones collide

(nikki: it's always the same way for me
ending in the same way.)

so much for the showdown
keeping up while keeping off
choking on the cold feet
rolling up the plastic sleeves
can't control the slow ride
little lover's so polite
turning off the low light
tell me did the bones collide
the bones collide
the bones collide
little lover's so polite
so polite
so polite
turning off the low light

(nikki: it's always the same way for me
blue turns soft with time
broke remains, an everyday disguise
ending in the same way. . .the same way)

...
tell me did the bones collide
the bones collide
the bones collide
little lover's so polite
so polite
so polite
