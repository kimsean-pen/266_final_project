Pretense your substance on dotted lines
And keep sidestepping notions of solace ties
Split tongue and a nervous stare
Arm the cannons, rain fire on the serpent's lair

Now you look it in the eyes

See, solve this (pretense)
All these say (you're wrong)
When we were (a stake)
Solace play (your hand)

You're running
How perfect
Your lie
Provoked
Change, against this
Reigning
Plaintiff
Renounce, bleed

Try
Try and
Try
To defang me
