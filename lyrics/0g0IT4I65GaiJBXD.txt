Waters Roger
Wall Live In Berlin
Another Brick In The Wall Part Ii (Ctd)
Chorus: We don't need no education,
We don't need no thought control.
No dark sarcasm in the classroom.
Teachers, leave those kids alone!
Hey, Teacher, leave those kids alone!
All in all you're
Just another Brick In The Wall.
All in all you're
Just another Brick In The Wall.

(Schoolmaster: Wrong! Do it again! Wrong! Do it again!
If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding!
How can you have any pudding if you won't eat yer meat?
You! Yes, you behind the grandstand!
Stand still, laddie!)
