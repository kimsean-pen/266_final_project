They all say I lost my mind
But I'm just trying to find a better way
'Cause somewhere in this sea of fools
The real truth is they're scared because you're brave
You'll be okay
If you'll be, yourself, for no one else
They'll hate you 'cause you're beautiful
So blaze the trail, that no one can
'Cause they'll never understand

We live in a Bad Girl's World
Bad Girl's World, Bad Girl's
We're running a Bad Girl's World
Bad Girl's World, Bad Girl's
We live in a Bad Girl's World
Bad Girl's World, Bad Girl's
We're running a Bad Girl's World
Bad Girl's World, Bad Girl's

All you rebel babies
(Bad Girl's)
And your pretty thing with the dirty mouth.
Oh
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em times are changing
We will never back down
This is our house now

If you'll be, yourself, for no one else
They'll hate you 'cause you're beautiful
Yeah, so blaze the trail, that no one can
Cause they'll never understand

We live in a Bad Girl's World
Bad Girl's World, Bad Girl's
We live in a Bad Girl's World
Bad Girl's World, Bad Girl's
We live in a Bad Girl's World
Bad Girl's World, Bad Girl's
We're running a Bad Girl's World
Bad Girl's World, Bad Girl's

If you'll be, yourself, for no one else
They'll hate you 'cause you're beautiful
Yeah, so blaze the trail, that no one can
Cause they'll never understand

We live in a Bad Girl's World
Bad Girl's World, Bad Girl's
We're running a Bad Girl's World
Bad Girl's World, Bad Girl's
We live in a Bad Girl's World
(Bad Girl's World, Bad Girl's)
We're running a Bad Girl's World
Bad Girl's World, Bad Girl's
