Will I be fine
I never ever know
No one ever ever knows
Have I lost my mind
Oh Tell me why
I can't live and die
Elegantly high
and beautifully blind
Tell me I'll be fine
Tell me sweet sweet lies
Cuz I'm dead inside
Cuz I'm dead inside tonight
Oh yeah
Oh no oh yeah, yeah
And Oh there's too many people
there's too many people
That walk alone
And I, I don't know what love is
Oh I don't know what love is
Until you say goodbye
So I sing this song
That'll be just ours
That'll be just ours
Oh yeah yeah don't say goodbye
I just need some help
I can't look at myself
Cuz I'm numb inside
And everything will die
Tell me I'll be fine
Tell me sweet, sweet lies
Cuz I'm dead inside
And everything will die
And Oh there's too many people
there's too many people
That walk alone yeah
And I, I don't know what love is
Oh I don't know what love is
Until you say goodbye
So don't say goodbye
So don't say goodbye
So don't say goodbye
So done say goodbye
And Oh there's too many people
there's too many people
That walk alone
And I, I don't know what love is
Oh I don't know what love is
Until you say goodbye
So I sing this song
That'll be just our
That'll be just ours
And Oh there's too many people
there's too many people
That walk alone
And I, oh I don't know what love is
Oh I don't know what love is
Until you say goodbye
So don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye now babe
Don't say goodbye
