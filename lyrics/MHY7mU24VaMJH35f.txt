Yeah
I feel you too
Feel
Those things you do

In your eyes I see a fire that burns
To free the you that's running through
Deep inside you know
Seeds I plant will grow

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah, come on, come on now take the chance
That's right, let's dance

Snake
I am the snake
Tempting
That bite to take

Let me make your mind
Leave yourself behind
Be not afraid
I've got what you need
Hunger I will feed

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah, come on, come on now, take the chance
Haha, come dance
Yeah, come dancing

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah, come on, come on now, take the chance

Yeah
I feel you too
Feel
Those things you do

In your eyes I see a fire that burns
To free the you that's running through
Deep inside you know
Seeds I plant will grow
One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah, come on, come on now, take the chance
That's right, will dance
Mmm, it's nice to see you here
Haha
