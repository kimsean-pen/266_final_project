His clocks are all wrong
But he knows by how much
He'll turn on you quick with a clinical touch
With a clinical touch he'll set you in fits?
And force you to bed for the fruits of the rich

And he'll burn you alive
He knows where you hide
Leave you cold and surprised
You know he broke two hearts in two weeks

He'll swallow your bones and steal all your spit
And bring you to life like a talking puppet
Like a talking puppet he'll play with your limbs
Swap them around and tie them to strings

And he'll burn you alive
He knows where you hide
Leave you cold and surprised
You know he broke two hearts in two weeks

Don't let it begin to know where you win?
Cus he sired? but he smelt your scent
Insanity went out you to the day?

Broke two hearts in two weeks
Broke two hearts in two weeks

Tracing his steal? yeah pacing his den
If you've got it right then he'll take you again
He'll take you again down to his cell
And although she'll want to she will never tell

And he'll burn you alive
He knows where you hide
Leave you cold and surprised
You know he broke two hearts in two weeks

I think thats mostly right.
