I was dreaming a note
In the cemetery
Shadows in my heart
And sadly

I still hear you cry
My little one, my baby
I still hear you cry
My little one, my baby

Shadows on the wall
Icy cemetery
So cold was the ground
And sadly

I still hear you cry
My little one, my baby
I still hear you cry
My little one, my baby

I still hear you cry
My little one, my baby
I still hear you cry
My little one, my baby
