You glanced my away, I almost lost all control
Anxiety had taken hold
My body quivers, hot flashes ignited in me, ooh, ooh, ooh
Gazing deep into my eyes
You spoke these words, I was
hypnotized
Let me share a night in your fantasy, ooh, ooh

Turn on emotions so strong
Passion's fire burns on and on
My body screams, please make love to me,

'Cause you're the object of my desire
Baby ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey you really turn me on

You're the object of my desire
Baby ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey you really turn me on

You're the object of my desire
Baby ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey you really turn me on

You're the object of my desire
Won't you ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey you really turn me on

You're the object of my desire
Won't you ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey you really turn me on

When i go to sleep at night
Visions of you here by my side
Fireworks explode deep inside of me oh-i-yi-yi-yi
I pinch myself as I'm lyin there
We kiss each other now im really scared
Too much to ask even for a fantasy oh, oh, oh

Turn on emotions so strong
Passion's fire burns on and on
My body screams, please make love to me

'Cause you're the object of my desire
Baby ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey you really turn me on

You're the object of my desire
Baby ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey you really turn me on
You're the object of my desire
Won't you ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey you really turn me
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
Yeah, yeah
