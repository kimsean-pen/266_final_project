Each step is moving, it's moving me up
moving, it's moving me up
Every step is moving me up
moving me up, moving, moving me up
Every step is
moving me up
One tiny, tiny,
tiny move
It's all I need
And I jump over
Every step is moving me up

This is how we walk on the moon
This is how we walk on the moon

Every step is moving me up
I'm so far away
One moment there
Moving me up
Every step is moving me up
One moment there
One tiny, tiny move
It's all I need and I jump over
