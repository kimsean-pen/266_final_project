Beat beat me to death
I said it
beat beat me to death
gray death beat me
Jimmy is begging
beat beat beat beat beat beat

If you are expecting consolation
I will become outrageous
if you expect me to be outrageous
I will be extra outrageous
chew the corner off your mouth
you have never liked the taste
beat beat me to death
I said it
beat beat me to death
gray death beat me
Jimmy is crying
beat beat beat beat beat beat

You were beautiful when I loved you
my little bank robbing boy
you were beautiful when I lost you
like whip covered in pins and glue
when will it end
oh when will it end
this sopping wet towel of stupidity
supplicated to the fawn
fold back my pajama sleeves
take a look at what I have done
you can protect nothing

Beat beat me to death
I said it
beat beat me to death
gray death beat me
Jimmy is in flames
beat beat beat beat beat beat

Beat beat me to death
I said it
beat beat me to death
gray death beat me to death
Jimmy is aborted
beat beat beat beat beat beat
