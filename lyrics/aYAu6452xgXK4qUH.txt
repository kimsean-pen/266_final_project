Come and kiss the unclean hand
for a field of ink below
As I falter on the verge
with a blade in my arms

I'm the ending as it comes
Drawing nearer
Spilling from its mouth

There's a room between the waves
where i've written my name
For the boulders in death
and the violet you drain

I'm the ending as it comes
Drawing nearer
Spilling from its mouth

You come without
and all falls within
There is a light in the world
There is a stone to the head

And I trace in maps of blood
from my arm to the ground
And i mistook you for the sea
As you washed away this life

I'm the ending as it comes
Drawing nearer
Spilling from its mouth

My beginning as you come
always clearer
through the purple blood

I'm the ending as it comes
Drawing nearer
Spilling from its mouth
