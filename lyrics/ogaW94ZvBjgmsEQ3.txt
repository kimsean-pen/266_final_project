there's no goin' back to that
i'm so numb, can't even react
didn't say it's not ok
but we aren't dealin' the same way

i ain't tellin' you a secret
i ain't tellin' you goodbye

it's the last thing on my mind
still you won't let things unwind
spinnin' tight around your head
can't you hear a word i've said

i ain't tellin' you a secret
i ain't tellin' you goodbye

when you call it's just not fair
it's the last thing you should share
i can't deal, i'll let you know
still i wish you'd let it go

i ain't tellin' you a secret
i ain't tellin' you goodbye

i'm tellin' you for one last time
it's not just you
the problem's mine to hide
i waited as long as i could
if you need it, sure i would
that's fine

well, there's no goin' back to that
i'm so numb can't even react
didn't say it's not ok
but we aren't dealin' the same way

i ain't tellin' you a secret
i ain't tellin' you goodbye
goodbye
goodbye
goodbye

i'm tellin' you for one last time
it's not just you
the problem's mine to hide

i waited as long as i could
if you need it, sure i would
that's fine

i'm takin' away a lot of stuff
i'm tellin' you it's rough
but not goodbye
