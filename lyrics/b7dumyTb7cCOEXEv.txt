How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough to know?
When it's time, time to let go
Sing

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

I ask for a sign from the sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me
But when you think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you and you for me

Oh I cannot hide the way I feel inside
I don't know why but every day I wanna cry
If I give you one more try to these rules, will you abide?
And if I mean anything to you, would it make everything all right?

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

I just wanna be so, so, happy
But the answer lies in me
I do believe that we could be happy
I said I wanna be happy, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah let it be

Life is too short to be tryin' to play some games
Now take some time and think about if it's really worth losing me
Why must it be this way?
Why do you have to play with my mind all the time?
Help me sing it

All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
