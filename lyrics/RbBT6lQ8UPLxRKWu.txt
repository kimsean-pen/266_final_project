All I want is all you got
Make me happy baby, an' I'll make it hot
I don't need no doctor, to tell me what to do
'Cause I know I'm goin', straight ahead for you

I got that tunnel vision goin' through my head
I can't help myself all I see is red
Tunnel vision goin' through my head
Lay me down inside your flyin' bed

All that's yours an' all that's mine
We'll put together baby and we can combine
We don't need no lawyer let's not make this long
We just need a love thing that's beautiful and strong

I got that tunnel vision goin' through my head
I can't help myself, all I see is red
Tunnel vision goin' through my head
Lay me down inside your flyin' bed

Tunnel vision goin' through my head
I can't help myself, all I see is red
Tunnel vision goin' through my head
Lay me down inside your flyin' bed

Come an' get me
Yeah

Tunnel vision goin' through my head
I can't help myself, all I see is red
Tunnel vision goin' through my head
Lay me down inside your flyin' bed

Tunnel vision goin' through my head
I can't help myself, all I see is red
Tunnel vision goin' through my head
Lay me down inside your flyin' bed
