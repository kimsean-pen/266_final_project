Erosion of life I see
it makes the passion burn in me
Life it always withers away
Death will eternally stay

Corpses in their coffins
forever rest in peace?
There sleeping with the aspergillus
is this justice to the dead?

The atrocious sight of burial ecremony
Christians weeping for the departed
They won't understand, they should envy them!

The deceased they know, if there's a paradise
Or shall we feel, the purgatory!
I open the graves, admire the rot
I can feel the presence, of something beyond

Aureola of nauseating reek
Wings of shriveled skin
Holy beauty of a carcass
Divine sight for me to gaze upon!

Necrolatic! Reverence for putrefaction
Necrolatic! reverence for the stench

I kneel, before a carrion
I pray, before the dead
I know, they shall rise
I fear, for the scourge
I revere, power of the dead
