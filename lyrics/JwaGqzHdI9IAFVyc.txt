There is history in this place
there are dragons to be chased
and though I dont now who you are
easy flow and a strong, a strong heart
and the charm in way way you have
gently take my skull for a ride
and I dont know who you are
but I know I know what I would like you to think
one night stand and distone persuation
but a joy that I cant hind
gently take my skull for a ride
we can never ever go to far
The pain we can't escape at least will wait
So let's go quickly, no we go slow
Let's go chasing dragons through the snow
Kindly take my all
And give me all you have
Gently take my skull for a ride
Take and shake your soul
But never lose control
Gently take your skull for a ride
