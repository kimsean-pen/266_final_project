Behind his way, in silence, lies a vacant space
He hides between desire and a will to fade
So, he make of honey, but between the lights
The grips are quickly closing in so serpentine

Hold me closer to you
(Hold me closer to you)
Mold me, make me anew
She moves
She moves, she moves, she moves
She moves
She moves, she moves, she moves
She moves

She slides to his sign like she's hypnotized as he takes her measure
His pulse begins to raise to a rhythm that takes a pleasure
When you trace her skin, your touch is hot
Whisper softly, tell her what you want

She moves just for you
Just for you
Just how you like
Just how you like
Just how you like
She moves just for you
Just for you
Just how you like
Just how you like
Just how you like
She moves just for you
Just for you
Just how you like
Just how you like
Just how you like
She moves just for you
Just for you
Just how you like
Just how you like
Just how you like
