I am a simple man
So I sing a simple song
I never been so much in love
And never hurt so bad at the same time

I am a simple man
And I play a simple tune
I wish that I could see you once again across the room
Like the first time

I just want to hold you, I don't want to hold you down
I hear what you're saying and you're spinning my head around
And I can't make it alone

The ending of the tale
Is the singing of the song
Make me proud to be your man only you can make me strong
Like the last time

I just want to hold you, I don't want to hold you down
I hear what you're saying and you're spinning my head around
And I can't make it alone
