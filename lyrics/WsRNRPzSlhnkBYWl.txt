I used to be clean before I was a teen
when I hit 15 my vision turned green
In school I only dreamed when I'll be in magazines
with my homies hit the gym we got lean
Can't forget my past just like wolverine
my costume is me like it's always halloween
I want to taste dirt cuz all i feel is hurt
feels so alone on a big pile of bones

I dont wanna live no mo x3
Please leave me alone x3
Karma will give you raw x3
If i cant get high x3
Then i just die

Stuck in this dump when i should be in miami
if you don't understand me then just fly pass me
Tell me something that i dont know
Life is fast joints burn slow
Massage my mind with colours and grind
Im the man with too many eyes
And im lost in the dark damn its your heart
