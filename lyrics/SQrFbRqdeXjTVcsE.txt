Gazing ahead but well knowing they're blind
Like looking for stars that they'll never find
Synthesized instinct establishing drive
Extending to nerves, engulfing the spine
Catatonic, they think that it's real
A curve in the Arc, it becomes a wheel
"Minutes like seasons - a rush of air
Inducing reason - but burning a flair."
There's a hand that reaches through minds
Probing far and wide
And in time you will learn to receive what it finds
A process sublime
"It can't burn on forever, it dies.
The hand, a beholder to see you through time."
"Time? Time is a winding dial. "
Minutes, seconds going by
Glimpses, fractures, micro-sized
Connecting the panes together
The shades bleed and the cracks collide into passages

"Sweeping the forefront, it works beneath the brain."
