They say in chess you've got to kill the queen and then you made it
Oh why - do you?

A funny thing the king who gets himself assasinated
Hey now, every time I lose - altitude

You took a town by storm the mess you made was nominated
Oh why - Do you?

Now put away your welcome, soon you'll find you've over stayed it
Hey now, every time I lose - altitude

So divine, hell of an elevator, all the while my fortune faded
Nevermind, the consequences of the crime this time my fortune's faded

The medicated state of mind you've found is over rated
Oh why - Do you?

You saw it all come down and now its time to imitate it
Hey now, every time I lose - altitude

So divine, hell of an elevator, all the while my fortune faded
Nevermind, the consequences of the crime this time my fortune's faded
Come on god, do I seem bullet proof...
So divine, hell of an elevator, all the while my fortune faded
Nevermind, the consequences of the crime this time's my fortune's faded
So divine, hell of an elevator, all the while my fortune faded
Nevermind, the consequences of the crime this time's my fortune's faded
