Oh, well imagine
As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor
And I can't help but to hear
No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words
"What a beautiful wedding"
What a beautiful wedding says a bridesmaid to a...
"And yes but what a shame, what a shame the poor groomsbride is a **ore"

I chimed in with a "Haven't you people ever heard of, closing a goddamn door, no?"
It's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in "Haven't you people ever heard of, closing a goddamn door, no?"
It's better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of...

Oh, well in fact
Well I'll look at it this way
I mean technically our marriage is saved
And this calls for a toast so pour the champagne
Oww, well in fact
Well I'll look at it this way
I mean technically our marriage is saved
And this calls for a toast so pour the champagne
Pour the champagne

I chime in with a "Haven't you people ever heard of, closing a goddamn door, no?"
It's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in "Haven't you people ever heard of, closing a goddamn door, no?"
It's better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
Again

I chime in "Haven't you people ever heard of, closing a goddamn door, no?"
It's better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in "Haven't you people ever heard of, closing a goddamn door, no?"
It's better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality

Ohh, well I, I said
"Haven't you people ever heard of, closing a goddamn door, no?"
