Say it, y'all

Ah, it's the champagne pourin', big joint rollin'
Bombay sippin', no blunt smokin'
Bad bitch gettin', thick and she got some friends with her

I take 'em out pourin' shots of liquor
Drinkin' out the bottle, smiling in all my pictures

The marijuana loud so them hoes follow like twitter
Nigga, you know everything Taylored
Don't rush to the bar, fool, if you ain't got no paper
That's the rules
High as fuck, sloppy drunk when I'm passin' through

Rollin' doobies up, yo ho who we pass 'em to
Hit the club, spend this money up, roll another one
Drink, act a fool, that's what I have to do
See I been drinkin' champagne all night

Never worry 'bout a damn thing and y'all might
Homie, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level
Yeah, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level
So I'll take one shot to the brain

And I order three more shots, I'm goin' in
Hey, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level
Yeah, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level, yeah
Spent a couple dollars on my engine motor roarin'

When I back out the garage, gin got me drunk as fuck
Stumblin' out the bar, plus I'm strugglin', tryna find
The keys to my car 'cause I be goin' hard
Roll the camera, life just like a movie, I'm the star

Wish you was in my position, you too broke to play the part
Of course I keep some bad women with me in the back
Sippin' rose with some hash twistin'
All about a dollar, my team in the cash gettin'

Straight out of the burb where we drinkin', we smash niggas
So when I say I'm ballin', I don't mean that I'm playin', mate
All my diamonds talkin', you can see what they sayin', man
See I been drinkin' champagne all night

Never worry 'bout a damn thing and y'all might
Homie, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level
Yeah, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level
So I'll take one shot to the brain

And I order three more shots, I'm goin' in
Hey, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level
Yeah, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level, yeah
In the middle of the night, early in the mornin'

From the streets to the sheets with some freaks, I ain't yawnin'
I'm wide awake, we ain't eatin' and we ain't sleepin'
These bitches so high, man, we ain't even speakin'
We just freakin', you rollin' with Short dog, baby

She was high on that pill, so I fucked yo lady
Come to my house, I give 'em everything they want
I might not do it, but I give to you woman
Cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, GHB, marijuana

She can suck it if she wanna
I got tequila, Ciroc and two freaky friends
And it's a Wednesday night, this ain't the weekend
See I been drinkin' champagne all night

Never worry 'bout a damn thing and y'all might
Homie, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level
Yeah, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level
So I'll take one shot to the brain

And I order three more shots, I'm goin' in
Hey, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level
Yeah, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level, yeah
Man, I'm high as fuck, man, I swear I'm on my level
Man, I'm sloppy drunk, man, I swear I'm on my level
I finna pass out, man, I swear I'm on my level
A nigga get smashed out
My nigga, I swear I'm on my level
Man, I'm high as fuck, man, I swear I'm on my level
Man, I'm sloppy drunk, man, I swear I'm on my level
I finna pass out, man, I swear I'm on my level
A nigga get smashed out
My nigga, I swear I'm on my level
See I been drinkin' champagne all night
Never worry 'bout a damn thing and y'all might
Homie, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level
Yeah, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level
So I'll take one shot to the brain
And I order three more shots, I'm goin' in
Hey, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level
Yeah, I'm on my level, yeah, I'm on my level, yeah
