I'm a deep sea diver with my fins
and underneath your current I do swim
a baker's dozen pertty pearls
and where I travel on my toes do curl
cause you, you got everthing that I want
a car, a house, and a dog
you got everything that I want

Just keep me a while
Just keep me a while
Just keep me a while
Just keep me a while

I'm a deep sea diver losing air
and around here I'm sad swimming
you don't care
