I'm so glad that you're here
I'm so glad you crawl this road
It's so sweet how you care

I bet you pray for your shot
Oh

No!
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
You're gonna listen to what I say next time
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut your fucking lifeless life at once!

You're kind that you feel
Through your race I can be saved
You embrace my decay
Maybe that I once signed my name

No!
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
You're gonna listen to what I say next time
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut your fucking lifeless life at once

Shut! Shut! Shut! Shut, shut the fuck up!
Shut! Shut! Shut! Shut, shut the fuck up!
Shut! Shut! Shut! Shut, shut the fuck up!
You're gonna listen this life is mine!

NO!
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut uá¹—, shut up
You're gonna listen to what I say next time
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut your fucking lifeless life at once
