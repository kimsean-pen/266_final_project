Bored
Distract myself with what is given
Corpse
All my ideas stay unwritten
I can try harder, I can better, I can do more but I know I won't
And I know apathy, and I know acceptance and a lack of motivation is what they want.

I can have beliefs and I can
wear them on my sleeve but
I will do nothing about them just
stay in an look at screens.
This life spent basking in the blue light.

I can speak of change
but in the end I feel ashamed
because although I can explain
I do not act on what I say
A waste of time is hearing what is on my mind.

Mind, active trapped inside a stationary body.
Down and out, I feel a constant sense of waiting.

Pious reflections on thing I have only just come to understand,
Riotious hypocricy bubbling from the lips of a lazy young man.
