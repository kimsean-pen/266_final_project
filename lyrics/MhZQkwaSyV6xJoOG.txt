Saturn V rise as gravity dies
Through ionosphere he flies
Capsule is flown beyond the known
Admixture sustains smokesuit as home
Traverse galactic sea inhaler of the rifftree
Initiate burn never to return
A distant earth fades receding

Through the hashteroid fields a transmission yields
Now riff beacon signal is received
Trajectory set a new bearing cross
Alien skies command module flies
Sojourns the lone stoned soul
Marijuanaut loads of a new bowl
Behold as he enters the clearing
Planet Iommia nearing

Through Iommosphere chutes deploy capsule splash down on the TH sea
To raft row the hash oil leagues to shoreline
