I'm running around in here
Spinning in circles inside my head
But I retrace the steps to retrace steps
I just retrace the steps to retrace steps
I've learned to embrace the fear
And nothing I believe will take me
Past the edge I'm past the edge
Past the edge I'm past the edge

And you've left me with no choice
My hands are tied and I won't listen

Bloodlust is real
I never thought I'd be right here
But the bloodlust is real
You can't make me feel alive
I will be your animal
You can be my cannibal

Everything is closing in
Surrounded by the darkness
And I dive right in and I dive right in
I cannot swim but I dive right in
Vision is blurred and I start to spin
The walls come crashing down
And I'm alone again, I'm alone again
Alone again, I'm alone again

And you left me no choice
The urge is real and you can't help me

Bloodlust is real
I never thought I'd be right here
But the bloodlust is real
You can't make me feel alive
I will be your animal
You can be my cannibal

I wrote a letter that you'll never read
I shed a tear that you'll never see
I'm buried with these words that I never speak
I am the darkness that you'll never see

Bloodlust is real
Bloodlust is real

Bloodlust is real
I never thought I'd be right here
But the bloodlust is real
You can't make me feel alive
I will be your animal
You can be my cannibal
