I've been waiting for you
To come around and tell me the truth
About everything that you're going through
My girl, you've got nothing to lose

Cold nights and the Sunday mornings
On your way and out of the gray

I've got time
I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

Crowded town, silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

I've been dreaming 'bout us
Working hard and saving it up
We'll go and see the man on the moon
My girl, we've got nothing to lose

Cold nights and the Sunday mornings
On your way and out of the gray

I've got time
I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

Crowded town, silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

My girl, my girl
It takes one hard second to turn it around
It takes one hard second to turn it around

I've got time
I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

Crowded town, silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head an'
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

I've got time
I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

Crowded town, silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl
