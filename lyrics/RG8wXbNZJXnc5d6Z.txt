I knew how it felt to be another one in need
Of someone to show the way
Until you saw a part of me that nobody else could see
And my life hasn't been the same

You make me feel lucky as I can be
You make me feel lucky as I can be

Before I couldn't get a break
Never had a chance to make the impressions I want to
But now it falls right into place
When I get to see your face
Then there's nothing that I can't do

You make me feel lucky as I can be
You make me feel lucky as I can be

No more dark days, only sun rays
No more hard ways with you today

You make me feel
You make me feel lucky as I can be
Lucky as I can be
Lucky as I can be
