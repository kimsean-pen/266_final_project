Did I not love enough to keep your attention on and on?
Am I the stupid one
For doing everything that I did for us?

I put a pillow under your hair
Gave you tender loving my care
And I didn't make it a thing, ya mama didn't know that I was there
I tried to swallow my pride
When you left me lonely outside
And I didn't know you would never show,
You're so comfortable with white lies
Looking like a fool what else could I do
After all we've been through it still hurts

But I forgive you though my friends tell me not to
I forgive you even when it's so hard to

When we are good we're great
But I couldn't keep on carrying on this way
Won't ever be the same
But I'd rather know you're better
Off than when you left us

I put a pillow under your hair
Gave you tender loving my care
And I didn't make it a thing
Ya mama didn't know that I was there
I tried to swallow my pride
When you left me lonely outside
And I didn't know you would never show
You're so comfortable with white lies
Looking like a fool what else could I do
Ater all we've been through it still hurts

But I forgive you though my friends tell me not to
I forgive you even when it's so hard to
Maybe we can get together someday
But I want you to know we're okay, we're okay
But I want you to know we're okay, we're okay

I forgive you though my friends tell me not to
I forgive you even when it's so hard to
I had to, yeah
Maybe we can get together someday
But I want you to know we're okay, we're okay
But I want you to know we're okay, we're okay
