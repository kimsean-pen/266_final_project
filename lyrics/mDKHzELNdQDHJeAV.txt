I can't afford to be silent
I can't afford to lose my stand
What matters is to be in view
I am seen therefore I am
I can satisfy my hunger
I can satisfy my thirst
What about the feeling of importance
Now I've got my chance

This is just what I need
To be in everyone's eyes
To be hard-wired to all brains
And control all their minds

In the center of attention
TV
Glossy magazines
My private life is public
I sell everything
Days are getting shorter
They'll forget about me soon
So I jump on the bandwagon
With no taboos

This is just what I need
To be in everyone's eyes
To be hard-wired to all brains
And control all their minds

But what if we start to talk
Not only say out loud
What if we sift the babble
From what really counts
What if we disappear
Go deeply underground
What if we hide away
From being stupefied

You and I
Thousand eyes
