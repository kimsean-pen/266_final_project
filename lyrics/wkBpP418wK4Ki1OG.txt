How we came runnin' if different things won't touching me
We claim one victory, best without a thrill
How we came here runnin' it's like he couldn't say he love her
Flashing, don't always
I ain't mean that cause either we force to stay

How we came runnin' to escape the fame
Still don't wanna die, now I gotta change
How they came runnin'? But out of flame
How we'll get up, how we arrive the day

How can I forget you? If you never let it go, you fight out to rescue
How could I forget you, the hurricane that keeps me say you on my future
How we came runnin' if the [?] up the falling
That's not accident and now you lost a fan
How they cam runnin'all the dream they put you on just before that day
Should sold all that, better than regret
How they came runnin' makes you build at last
So I can speed [?] never face the fact

I became a runin'
I became a runin'
I became a runin'
I became a runin'

How could I forget you if you never laid your fears and let it all for rescue
How could I reject you, the hurricane that keeps me say you on my future
Keep your head up,

How could I forget you, how could I forget you
How could I forget you, how could I forget you
He'll beats for two at onceand my heart will go on

Surreder that time so force to know all your feels
I'm going so could and I can't see it up to you

How could I forget you if you never laid your fears and let it all for rescue
How could I reject you, the hurricane that keeps me say you on my future
How could I forget you if you never laid your fears and let it all for rescue
How could I reject you, the hurricane that keeps me say you on my future
