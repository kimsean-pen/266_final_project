with one hand above the rising line
fighting to keep my innocence dry
before we sail this raft aground
if we won't live to hear the sound

no built ship can save their kind
they'll be holding their breaths
for the rest of their lives
before you sail that raft aground
join us in the search and take a dive

flotsam and jetsam all this driftwood
can't you see the forest for the trees
