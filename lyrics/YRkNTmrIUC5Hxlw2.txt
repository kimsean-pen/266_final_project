Pains is blue
Wherever she goes
Don't play it cool
When the music is on
You never feel it's right
Oh when the night breaks your heart in two

There's a backbeat blues
On the echoing night
There ain't no love, or maybe one or two
And I don't wanna let you down
Oh when the drums start coming through the bar

A paper dream
It's not just for someone else, you know
It's a paper dream
When you feel so old, and you feel like nothing
A paper dream
Does it make you feel like no-one else?
When the band is singing all of your life

Boys are fools
And no love is on time
Girls in the mood
Is it a typical lie?
Oh darling, can't you see?
We never know when the lights would go out

It's a big big world
And it's nothing at all
I gotta sing what's never sung in the rain
And the silly little dream you have
It will never bring you down
You will get it

A paper dream
It's not just for someone else, you know
It's a paper dream
When you feel so old, and you feel like nothing
A paper dream
Does it make you feel like no-one else?
When the band is singing all of your life

A paper dream
It's not just for someone else, you know
Just the way you feel
When you put the same records on again & again
A paper dream Does it make you feel like no-one else?
When the band is singing all of your life

A paper dream
A paper dream
A paper dream
Does it make you feel like no-one else?
When you feel like singing all of your life
