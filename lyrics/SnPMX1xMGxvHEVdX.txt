Do you remember feeling invincible?
When there was trouble
It was us against the world
We kept running

Running through the night
Chasing the sun, 'til anything felt right
Can you save me now?
I get lost up in the clouds

Can you save me now?
You were my gravity
Can you save me now?
When your ground drops out

I get lost in the clouds
Save me now?
You were my gravity
Now my world is shattering
You were my gravity
You were my gravity
You left me out there, with no one but myself
In an open field for the lightning to strike me down

I was the moon; you were the sun
I can't seem to shine
Now that you're gone
Now I'm out of orbit

Because you left without warning
Are you somewhere better now?
Can you save me now?
I get lost up in the clouds

Can you save me now?
You were my gravity
Can you save me now?

When your ground drops out
I get lost in the clouds
Save me now?
You were my gravity

Now my world is shattering
You were my gravity
You were my gravity
When you went away
Thought it'd never be the same
Would the nightmare ever end?
If I could do it again
I wouldn't change a thing

'Cause it made me who I am
And now I'm shattering
Can you save me now?
When your ground drops out
I get lost in the clouds
Save me now?
You were my gravity
Can you save me now?
When your ground drops out
I get lost in the clouds
Save me now?
You were my gravity
Now my world is shattering
Now my world is shattering
You were my gravity
