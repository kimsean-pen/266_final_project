Seems like all these girls are perfect
All these girls are perfect
In LA, in LA
They've got so much there to purchase
All those labels on their purses
In LA, in LA
You ain't gotta die
Just go buy you a plane ticket
(Plane ticket, pla-plane ticket)
This place will change your life
Ask the guys who just came to visit
Once they came, they just can't go nowhere
Heaven must be somewhere in California
No place I've seen compares to California
There's nothing but angels out there
A place filled with angels I swear
They say come and join us
The weathers much warmer
Heaven's California
(Yao) Heaven's California

Blank face, amazing grace
God damn girl, got got god damn girl
Use your angel wings, no hands girl
I'm the man from the land girl
Go ham in the Lam' girl
You know skirt skirt
And if you skirt skirt
Give me work work
Thats missionary like church church
Legs open like pearly gates in a thug mansion
Get a thug passion
Without Alize
Bow down to pray
I burn an ounce a day
Puff puff pass
No rosaries like Catholics
Might cop the rolls, just to crash it
You could rock the rollie while I hit it
Hey you could rock the rollie while I hit it
Yeah school boy in a new toy
With a new toy, a whole down fig
You was looking for heaven and you found it
You was looking for heaven and you found it
Heaven must be somewhere in California
No place I've seen compares to California
There's nothing but angels out there
A place filled with angels I swear
They say come and join us

Heaven's California
Heaven's California
Man they party on the week days (count it)
Party on the week days (count it, count it, count it, count it)
In LA, in LA
I swear they know all the DJs
Walk in the club and don't pay
Man they must be so paid
Okay, in LA
They poppin in LA
You ain't gotta die
Just go buy you a plane ticket
