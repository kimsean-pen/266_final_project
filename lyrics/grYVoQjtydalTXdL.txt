No focus
Her birth is a dark explosion
No more comfort, a miracle or horror We are sitting and breathing
Do you hear that singing?
We are waiting for the meeting
This night is a child of a black sun
A glimpse of a black thing
A shimmer of a dark ring
A new place with the new feelings
A new way of living
A new way of thinking
A new way of breathing
This night is a child of a black sun
This night is a child of a black sun
This night is a child of a black sun
This night is a child of a black sun
This night is a child of a black sun
