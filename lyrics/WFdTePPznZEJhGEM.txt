The test begins now

I thought I was smart, I thought I was right
I thought it better not to fight
I thought there was a virtue in always being cool

So it came time to fight, I thought I' ll just step aside
And that the time would prove you wrong
And that you would be the fool

I don't know where the sunbeams end
And that the starlights begin
It's all a mystery

Oh, to fight is to defend
If it's not now then tell me when would be the time
That you would stand up and be a man

For to lose I could accept
But to surrender I just wept
And regretted this moment, oh that I, I was the fool

I don't know where the sunbeams end
And that the starlights begin
It's all a mystery

And I don't know how a man decides
What's right for his own life
It's all a mystery

Cause I'm a man, not a boy
And there are things you can't avoid
You have to face them when you're not prepared to face them

If I could, I would
But you're with him, I'd do no good
I should have fought him but instead I let him, I let him take you

I don't know where the sunbeams end
And that the starlights begin
It's all a mystery

And I don't know how a man decides
What's right for his own life
It's all a mystery
I don't know where the sunbeams end
And that the starlights begin
It's all a mystery
And I don't know how a man decides
What's right for his own life
It's all a mystery
I don't know where the sunbeams end
And that the starlights begin
It's all a mystery
Mystery
The test is over now
