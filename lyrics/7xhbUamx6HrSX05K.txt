All my days I wake up, open my eyes
Beneficiary of a genocide
Drive to work all day
Go to sleep at night
Beneficiary of a genocide

All of my life
I turned a blind eye

I don't know why
I turned a blind eye
All of this time

I really can't say why

I don't know why
I'm a history of violence

All my days I wake up, open my eyes
Beneficiary of a genocide
Drive to work all day
Go to sleep at night
Beneficiary of a genocide

All of my mind
I don't know where to find it
I don't know why
I'm a creature of habit
I'm a past and future
I'm a war never ending
But I la la la
I'm an ocean of carnage

All my days I wake up open my eyes
Beneficiary of a genocide
Drive to work all day
Go to sleep at night
Beneficiary of a genocide

All my days I wake up, open my eyes
Beneficiary of a genocide
Drive to work all day
Go to sleep at night
Beneficiary of a genocide
Every day I wake up, open my eyes
Beneficiary of a genocide
Drive to work all day
Go to sleep at night
Beneficiary of a genocide
All my days I wake up, open my eyes
Beneficiary of a genocide
Drive to work all day
Go to sleep at night
Beneficiary of a genocide
All my days I wake up, open my eyes
Beneficiary of a genocide
Drive to work all day
Go to sleep at night
Beneficiary of a genocide
