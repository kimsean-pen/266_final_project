A thorn in my side, chip on my shoulder
A lump in my throat, the size of a boulder
The chill up my spine, can' t get any colder
And you wonder why I can't smile

A knot in my gut, an ape on my back
In the heat of the moments I'm knocked off the track
You drop the ball, I pick up the slack
And you ask me why my hair's gray

Twisting, turning, losing all sense of yearning
Living and learning the pressure keeps on burning my soul
Burning my soul, burning my soul

I say, it's green and then you tell me it's red
Keep your thoughts and ideas locked inside of your head
We've got someone, who can think for you instead
And he sounds just like the last one

Twisting, turning, losing all sense of yearning
Living and learning the pressure keeps on burning my soul
Burning my soul, burning my sou
Burning my soul, burning my soul

Responsible thinkers throw caution to the wind
But I find myself speaking from within
I can't live my life walking on eggshells
To stay on your good side

Using your words, controlling my life
Can't you see it's my words that gives you your life
So I hurt your feeling's well, I'm really sorry
But I don't give a shit, no

Twisting, turning, losing all sense of yearning
Living and learning the pressure keeps on burning my soul
Burning my soul, burning my soul
Burning my soul, burning my soul, burning my soul, burning my soul
