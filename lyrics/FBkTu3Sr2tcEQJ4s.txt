You've found once, live wise.
The taste to come, we'll go.
Lost right taking the face, the coming show.

Threatening skies.
Threatening skies.

I will fear rising forms more slow.
Live the spell, takes the coming spell forth.
Ravishing you all.
Ravishing you all.
Ravishing you all.

Threatening skies.
Threatening skies.

You've found once, live wise.
The taste to come, we'll go.
Lost right taking the face, the coming show.

Threatening skies.
Threatening skies.
Threatening skies.
