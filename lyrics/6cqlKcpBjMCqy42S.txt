Well, jesus gonna be here
He gonna be here soon (yeah)
He's gonna cover us up with leaves
With a blanket from the moon (yeah)
With a promise and a vow
And a lullaby for my brow

Well, jesus gonna be here
Gonna be here soon
Well I'm not gonna do nothing
But wait here
I don't have to shout
I've got no reason
And I've got no doubt
I'm gonna get myself unfurled
From this mortal coiled up world

jesus gonna be here
Gonna be here soon
I got to keep my eyes
To keep 'em wide open
so I can see my lord
I'm gonna watch the horizon
For a brand new ford
Well I can hear him rolling on down the lane
I said hallowed be that name

'Cause jesus gonna be here
Gonna be here soon
Well I've got to keep myself
I've keep myself faithful
And you know that I've been so good
Except for drinking
But he knew that I would
When I'm gonna leave this place better
Than the way I found that it was

And jesus gonna be here
He gonna be here soon
I know my jesus gonna be here
He gonna be here soon
I know my jesus gonna be here
He gonna be here soon
