I don't want to be a rusty suit of armor
Or a tumbled out forgotten castle in your mind
I just want to be a twisted willow
So I can leave you shallow thinking far behind

I can feel the darkness in your shadow
And the melting of the ice behind your troubled eyes
And the discoloration of all the words you're saying
As you're hunted without mercy by your lies

I've flown so high I'll never return
And I've been to the bottom of the drags of your troubled soul
And I've basked in the sun of your revelations
But I guess
You and I have different goals
So go and slay your dragons in blind amusment
And topple imagination with a song

And the moon it plays little mind games
So you'll wonder where all the stars have gone
Listen to me
You have spoken to be about nothing
And you've shown me fantasies in a crystal ball
And you've promised me the world for my asking
Don't you know
That to me
It means nothing at all
Because I know you'd leave me a burnt out matchbox of forgotten roses
Inside a get well card I had to address to myself
But that's not what I need from another stranger
So I guess I better do things without your help
So I guess I better do things without your help
So I guess I better do things without your help
