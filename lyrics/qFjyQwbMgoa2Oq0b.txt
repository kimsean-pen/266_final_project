You've changed a goddamn thing
Hold your head up high
When the hardest times come
We're heading straight to the fight
Believe in yourself
Let the hell out of the door
Honor is among us
Honor is all we know

The night has come
We couldn't no longer see
Better days are around the corner for you and me
Receive the horizon
Down there's a golden glow
Honor is among us
Honor is all we know

It takes a courage to make it in this land
So don't forget to forgive every man
And prosperity about this river, you know, it will forever flow
Honor is among us
Honor is all we know
