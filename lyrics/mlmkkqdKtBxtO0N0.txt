A minute of truth time, talkin' 'bout stuff
Keep saying I'm danger, but thinking I'm love
I'm out on the dance floor, drinking my tears
Acting all clich√©, and facing my fears

Curious minds
Hearts pounding
Fingers in ties
Wet, dripping
Curious minds
Lips, lick 'em
Pupils grow wide

I feel that thing that jolts me, fucks with me good
Shivering gold
I shiver in gold
Wild, real
Got things like moon rocks rolled up in love
Shivering gold
I shiver in gold

Kissing it better, a physical face
Taking your body, I sit on your face
I see you smiling, covered in me
Moving too fast now, but fuck it, we're free

Curious minds
Hearts pounding
Fingers in ties
Wet, dripping
Curious minds
Lips, lick 'em
Pupils grow wide (wider)

I feel that thing that jolts me, fucks with me good
Shivering gold
I shiver in gold
Wild, real
Got things like moon rocks rolled up in love
Shivering gold
I shiver in gold

Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter

Curious minds
Hearts pounding
Fingers in ties
Curious minds
Lips, lick 'em
Pupils grow wide

I feel that thing that jolts me, fucks with me good
Shivering gold
I shiver in gold
Wild, real
Got things like moon rocks rolled up in love
Shivering gold
I shiver in gold

Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver
Bittersweet, that glitter
