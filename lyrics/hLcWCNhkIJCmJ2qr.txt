Echoes of reggae
Comin' through my bedroom wall
Havin a party up next door
But I'm sittin' here all alone
Two lovers in the bedroom
And the other starts to shout
All I got is this blank stare
And that don't carry no clout at all

Destination unknown
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
Destination unknown
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho

He's singin' and she's
There to lend a hand
He's seen his name on the marquee
But she will never understand
Once again he's leavin' and she's
There with a tear in her eye
Embraces with a warm gesture
It's time, time to say goodbye

Destination unknown
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
Destination unknown
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho

Ruby's heart ain't beatin'
Cause she knows the feelin' is gone
She's not the only one
Who knew there's somethin' wrong
Her lover's in the distance
As she wipes a tear from her eye
Ruby's fading out she disappears
It's time, time to say goodbye

Destination unknown
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
Destination unknown
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho

Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
Destination unknown
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
Destination unknown
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
