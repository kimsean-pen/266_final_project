Consume the curse
That brings you down
A fading liar
Who wakes up alone
It's there in front of you

Invert this tragedy to come
And reclaim your future
This is a call to arms
One quest at a time

Feed the hunger
Climb on up
Repress the negative
You are not alone
It's there in front of you

Invert this tragedy to come
And reclaim your future
This is a call to arms
One quest at a time

Avoid the mold
Desperate, you regress
Move through me
I'll be your triumph

Invert this tragedy to come
And reclaim your future
This is a call to arms
One quest at a time
