I gotta tell you a secret before it's too late...
I think you're beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
I think you're magical, magical, magical

Secret, secret, secret
I gotta tell you a secret, secret, secret
And I got to tell you that I...
And I got to tell you that I.

I can't stop thinkin' bout you everyday
And I want, I wanna let you know
I can't stop thinkin' bout you everyday
And I want, I wanna let you know
Your gravity pulls me, pulls me I can't lie
Your body is getting closer to mine
And we collide!
Let's make our moves control it
This is loving

We got the moon so close now
And I just can't stop the feeling we own now
And we can't stop

Some people may not vibbin'
With our space in time
No no no...

I can't stop thinkin' bout you everyday
And I want, I wanna let you know
I can't stop thinkin' bout you everyday
And I want, I wanna let you know
Your gravity pulls me, pulls me I can't lie
Your body is getting closer to mine
And we collide!
Let's make our moves control it
This is loving
