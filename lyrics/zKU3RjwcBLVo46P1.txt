Lost in a churning mindless fulmination
Devoid of a reason or explanation
a chorus of voices become a roaring cacophony
assaulting our senses as they sleep

putrid beings within, no better, or worse
each one scrambling for a ladder
death becomes us, that which we adore
long lost innocence

In these slime-ridden Kingdoms where we wallow
free from the pity, disgust and sorrow
far from where light can pierce
drowned by the fetid bog
beyond the graces of your god

Sink in, inhale the ichor
why not assume your true form?
Join with us this is our blessing
unified as one forever
biologically entwined
Together until the end time.

hideous depravity lurks beneath the mask of civility

Look to your heathen master for his coming
We shall obey him and speak of nothing
Mentor of pain and suffering
the spawn of the sentient ooze
Soon you will drown within him too

in the name of the Greatfather, worship him and no other
Bestow upon us the sigil, arise from your silent ritual
