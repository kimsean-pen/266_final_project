The caution tape that you've wrapped around my brain
Has continued to stay as I'm waiting for a break
Constantly connecting dots
Trying my best, consuming facts
All I've learned is what's done is done
And you can not change the past
Helping or hurting?
I am numb
I haven't felt anything in days
Confusion is key as I am locked inside
Or am I just really gone?

The caution tape that you've wrapped around my brain
Has continued to stay
A constant strain right behind my face
I'm still waiting for a slight break
For a slight break

And I know we're just different
I know we're just different
Keep drinking from the same cup
It'll fill you up
It'll keep you numb
Simplify the motions
Counteract the movements
Don't think twice because this is love
This is love
This is love

The caution tape that you've wrapped around my brain
Has continued to stay
A constant strain right behind my face
I'm still waiting for a slight break

You are caffeine in my bloodstream
You are the energy hidden in between two muscles sleeping
Please don't wake me up
I miss myself too much
I miss myself too much
I miss myself too much
So please don't wake me up
Don't wake me up

'Cause all I have is patience
We all lose strength someday
I've been waiting for a slight break
