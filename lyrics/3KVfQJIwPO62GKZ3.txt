Catch me in my element
I'm always irrelevant
I'm always the elephant at a party
Don't need another man
I don't want to shake your hand
I don't care or give a damn I want forty
Forty ounces of my pain
Forty nights and forty days
Forty ways to say "I don't feel sorry"
Lace up your timberlands
Step on my heart again
I'll never let you in

Im always the first to laugh when it hurts
I don't know whats worse
Pretending to care with just words

I'm my own worst enemy
I'm my favorite centerpiece
Whatever, at least I'm trying to be myself more
I hate a compliment
When it don't make any sense
When it don't have sustenance
Don't tell me more
About how we could be
In an activity
With you body up against my body, what for?
A holy trinity
Me, myself, and I could be
If we ever can agree

I'm always the first to laugh when it hurts
I don't know what's worse
Pretending to care with just words

I need some oxygen
You're a bit too close again
Lace up your timberlands
You've gotta be walkin'

I'm always the first to laugh when it hurts
I don't know what's worse
Pretending to care
I'm always the first to laugh when it hurts
I don't know what's worse
Pretending to care with just words

Step on my heart again
I'll never let you in
Step on my heart again
I'll never let you in
