Let's be one another's present tense
We'll go to the mountain by the lake, we'll undress
We'll swim and we'll swim until the sun settles to sleep
We'll build us a fire of a flame so deep
In the morning we'll rise where the world moves on
We'll take to the badlands and we'll sing us this song

It goes, "Ah"
It goes, "Ah"

It runs through us, this movement,
It fills us with sun
See that tree,
I will climb it,
I will pick you a plum
See that tree,
I will climb it,
I will pick you a plum
