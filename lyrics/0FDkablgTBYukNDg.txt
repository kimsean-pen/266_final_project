St. Martin de Porres, his shepherd's staff a dusty broom
St. Martin de Porres, the poor made a shrine of his tomb
St. Martin de Porres, he gentled creatures tame and wild
St. Martin de Porres, he sheltered each unsheltered child
This man of love, born of the flesh, yet of God
This humble man healed the sick, raised the dead, his hand is quick
To feed beggars and sinners, the starving homeless and the stray
Oh Black Christ of the Andes, come feed and cure us now we pray

Spare, oh lord
Spare my people
Lest you be angered with me, forever
(Lest you be angered with me, forever)

This man, this man
Of love, born of the flesh, yet of God
This humble man healed the sick, raised the dead, his hand is quick

St. Martin de Porres, he gentled creatures tame and wild
St. Martin de Porres, he sheltered each unsheltered child
