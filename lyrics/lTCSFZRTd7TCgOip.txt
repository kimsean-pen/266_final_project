You walk the streets

Never feel no guilt
You make your money selling guns on the playground
I'm so ashamed

Cause we're all the same
Killing in the name money is the game now
And you're buying bombs

And we pay the price
Eat your lies and we feed it to the children
Is this what you what

Is this what you need
You're gonna kill us all to bring peace
My blood

My soul

Is my enemy
My love
My life
Is poison to me
I know it's not how it's supposed to be
Got no choice
No voice
I have no dignity
You manipulate
With your bag of tricks

You're playing God with the world on my shoulder

I can't regulate
Cause the worlds at stake
We're so lost that we all think it's over

But I'm the one to blame
For this burning pain
It's eating up the world

And we gonna live it in shame
It's hard to maintain
when it's so insane
It's so, so insane
So kids don't listen to your parents
The parents can't teach us
All they ever left was a world in a mess
My blood
My soul
Is my enemy

My love

My life
Is poison to me

I know it's not how it's supposed to be
Got no choice

No voice
I have no dignity
We got no control
Of the state of our minds

Now I see that
All I ever lived was a lie
We're all duped to believe
That there's no way around,
There's no way around,
There's no way around!
My blood
My soul
Is my enemy
My love
My life
Is poison to me
I know it's not how it's supposed to be
Got no choice
No voice
I have no dignity
My blood
My soul
Is my enemy
My love
My life
Is poison to me
I know it's not how it's supposed to be
Got no choice
No voice
I have no dignity
