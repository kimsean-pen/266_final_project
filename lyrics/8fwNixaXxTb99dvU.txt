You make me mute, hiding the truth
Revealing a farce created by your mind
What do you expect, exposing your lies
Printed in your eyes, there's no alibi

To cooperate and not be allowed
They're killing my name, sewing my mouth
Prospect in life, lost in the line
To cooperate and just be alive

You gonna fall, hiding the truth
You gonna crawl, finding the truth
To blame myself, it's my disgrace
To blame the world by my mistakes

Dusted
Dusted
Dusted

Turn around and turning around
And turning around and inside out
Turn around and turning around
And turning around and inside out

Do not disturb!
Leave me alone!
The fear within, inside and beyond
The fear within, inside and beyond

You make me mute, hiding the truth
Revealing a farce created by your mind
What do you expect, exposing your lies
Printed in your eyes, there's no alibi

You gonna fall, hiding the truth
You gonna crawl, finding the truth
To blame the world by my mistakes
To blame the world by my mistakes
