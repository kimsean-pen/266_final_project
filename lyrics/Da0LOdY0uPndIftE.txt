Teach me how to love you like I wrote
and say it like i mean it when I don't
teach me how to hold you in my arms
without squeezing too damn tight and causing harm
and I'll learn not to look at you with scorn
oh, if you promise to never have me mourn

By all means give me lessons in my ways
but damnit dont expect me to change
mold me to the man that I should be
but don't consider that man to be free
and how am I expected to behave
oh, when I'm alone with my self every day

I'll never love you enough, my love
and I'll never hold you close enough

Teach me how to love you like I wrote
and say it like I mean it when I don't
