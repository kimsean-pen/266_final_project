When I was dead asleep
Behind
Towering walls

They built a world outside
And I
Missed the wake-up call

My stony breath crawled
To glory heavens be
There was a sea of sound
But old silence that stole my sleep

When I was dead asleep
Behind
Towering walls

They built a world outside
And I
Missed the wake-up call

When I break ____ legs
Through long winding streets
Fill me with suffering
And the people
would see right through me
