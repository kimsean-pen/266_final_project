I can't stop listening to this voice in my head
Got me turning through the covers on this rusty spring bed
Bust in the day's flames
Kissing my back
That's all I remember and then everything's black

You know, sounds so familiar
Some place high in my show
Hello transmission: now you're in control

I look up
I look down
Everybody's bigger than Holy Water
Ain't enough going around
Raise their cups
Wear their crowns
Just sitting on a ghost-stained altar
Feel the jungle youth sound, ooh ooh

I woke in a fever taste the blood in my mouth
My eyes grew shiny purple and I'm riddled with doubt
It feels so peculiar, boiling hot in my soul
Farewell transmission: not made for this world

I look up
I look down
Everybody's bigger than Holy Water
Ain't enough going around
Raise their cups
Wear their crowns
Just sitting on a ghost-stained altar
Feel the jungle youth sound, ooh ooh

Tonight, drifting off to sleep
Tonight must be having a bad dream

I look up
I look down
Everybody's bigger than Holy Water
Ain't enough going around
Raise their cups
Wear their crowns
Just sitting on a ghost-stained altar
Feel the jungle youth sound, ooh ooh
