Do you even stand for what you preach?
Or is it just for validation?
You make it your purpose just to teach,
but it comes across like a contradiction
I've made it this far without you and I'll make it further yet
So spare me your fake words of praise

Does it matter what I do 'cause I'm good for nothing?
My hard work falls on deaf ears
Your view on equality smells like hypocrisy
I'm sorry did I offend you?

Please stop, trying so fucking hard
Your intentions are good but they are being forced
There's nothing wrong with your
compliments as long as they are genuine
Just please don't patronise me
I've made it this far without you and I'll make it further yet
So spare me your fake words of praise

Does it matter what I do 'cause I'm good for nothing?
My hard work falls on deaf ears
Your view on equality smells like hypocrisy
I'm sorry did I offend you?

Stop trying

Good, good for nothing
That is what I am judged by your standards
Good, good for nothing
That is what I am- cause you're not
listening to a word that I am - saying
