Hello six pack of confidence
Been so many nights since we first met
Glad to see you've brought all your friends
For another night of plastic cup politics

Hello mr six pack of confidence
i'm Glad to see you've already met
miss 12 ounces of loneliness
And mr. plasic cup politics
I see you're under the influence
Of warm beer in the comfort of all your friends
and i see that mr loudmouth has had his 40 ounce and will pass out
i have no doubt
So drop your plastic cups and clear your clouded heads

I keep askin myself if they realize
that their fears are really just the same as mine
Do they know that all their insecurities
are the same ones that are inside of me
as people come and go
do they know they're really not alone
And the life of the party just left
i guess i couldn't cure his emptiness
like all the rest
so drop your plastic cups and clear your clouded heads

Here we are, another wasted night and i am right along the side
of 40 sets of bloodshot eyes
and plastic smiles miles wide match plastic cups we'll leave behind

Woah
Its just another night
of plastic cup politics
plastic cup politics
plastic cup politics
plastic cup politics
plastic cup politics

So drop your empty cups
and clear your clouded heads!
