I put my heart on the line and showed ya'
All the best parts of me
Might've been too much
I should've made you show your cards
I should've known you were bluffing
I was mistaken
All caught in my feelings
Just wanted us to be real
Wish I could reverse the time
Reverse the script
So you know just how I feel
Summer's gone and you left me here to fall
And my heart froze, now you're gone
And these winters are so cold
Summer's gone and you left me here to fall
And my heart froze, now you're gone
And these winters are so cold
Summer nights
Summer nights
They're no more
Now that you're gone
Summer nights
Summer nights
They're no more
Now that you're gone
I was foolish to trust you with something
That you couldn't cherish
It might have been too much
I wish that I was better at this
Falling out of love is not as easy as it seems
I was mistaken
All caught in my feelings
Just wanted us to be real
Wish i could reverse the time
Reverse the script
So you know just how I feel
Summer's gone and you left me here to fall
And my heart froze, now you're gone
And these winters are so cold
Summer's gone and you left me here to fall
And my heart froze, now you're gone
And these winters are so cold
Summer nights
Summer nights
They're no more
Now that you're gone
Summer nights
Summer nights
They're no more
Now that you're gone
(Summer nights)
(Summer nights)
(They're no more)
(Now that you're gone)
