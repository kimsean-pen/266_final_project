I was lost
And you were found
You seem to stand on solid ground
I was weak
And you were strong
And me and my guitar,
we strummed along, oh

Sweet misery you cause me
That's what you called me
Sweet misery you cause me

I was blind
But oh, how you could see
You saw the beauty in everything,
everything and me

I would cry
And you would smile
You'd stay with me a little while

Sweet misery you cause me
That's what you called me
Sweet misery you cause me

And in my heart I see, oh
What you're doing to me
And in my heart I see, oh
Just how you wanted it to be
Sweet misery

Oh. whoa, oh
Ohh...

Sweet misery you cause me
That's what you called me
Sweet misery you cause me

And in my heart I see, oh
What you're doing to me
(What you're doing to me)
And in my heart I see, oh
Just how you wanted it to be
(Wanted it to be)
Sweet misery... ohh, sweet misery, ohh
Ohh... sweet misery

I was weak
And you were strong
And me and my guitar,
We strummed along
