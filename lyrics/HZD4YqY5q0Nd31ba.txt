Breathe me every time you close your eyes
Taste me every time you cry
This memory will fade away and die
Just for today, breathe me and say goodbye

How many times? How many times?
Now I can't look you in the eye
Now I can't look you in the eye
How many times? How many times?
Now I can't look you in the eye

See me, in the eyes of another's child
Turn away, when you see me walking by
Once in a while
This melody will fade away and die
Just for today, breathe me and say goodbye

How many times? How many times?
Now I can't look you in the eye
Now I can't look you in the eye
How many times? How many times?
Now I can't look you in the eye

And I don't even want to try
My my
'Cause every word from you is a lie
My my

How many times? How many times?
Now I can't look you in the eye
Now I can't look you in the eye
How many times? How many times?
Now I can't look you in the eye
