It came upon one night
When Nemesis besieged
Lightning streaked across the sky
And thunderclouds did scream

It came upon one night
On land the seas had turned
Typhoons swept with certain death
Air began to burn

Apocalypse is born
Nightmares will begin

It came upon one night so bittersweet the end
The world was cloaked in darkness
And winter brought the rain
A poisoned soul was pondering
This mortal fool's to blame

Defense became the joke of the day
Rivalry the nations now regret
Politicians threw our lives away
The day that dust and ice the Earth beset

Into battle cried the poor
As famine took its toll
The world had turned so desolate
That nothing much would grow

Apocalypse was born
Nightmares had begun
Nature claimed a victory
As neither side had won
The world was all asunder
When sorrow took a leave
Hatred fled when Christ returned to Earth as King...
