Woman left me with the blues
And I know just how I got 'em
I see a fifth of Jimmy Beam
I'm gonna drink it to the bottom
I ain't tryna hurt nobody
I ain't prone to give a damn
I got me nothin' left to lose
I'm in a honky-tonk mood

I'm in a honky-tonk mood
That's where I'll be all night
If anybody's lookin' for me
Look for a neon light, oh
We're playin' here tonight
And then I'm playin' here tomorrow
I got a whiskey and a tune
I'm in a honky-tonk mood

If I get to gettin' loud
Don't you worry 'bout it, boys
'Cause gettin' over this heartache
Is gonna make a little noise
If I start to dancin' 'round
Don't try and pull me off the floor
I'm just a-kickin' up my boots
I'm in a honky-tonk mood

I'm in a honky-tonk mood
That's where I'll be all night
If anybody's lookin' for me
Look for a neon light, oh
We're playin' here tonight
And then I'm playin' here tomorrow
I got a whiskey and a tune
I'm in a honky-tonk mood
I got a whiskey and a tune
I'm in a honky-tonk mood
