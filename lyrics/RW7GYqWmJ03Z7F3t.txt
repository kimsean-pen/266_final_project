At the psych ward
Plugged in with the white bars
What's your life for?
I'ma hit a high score
Let it die down, take it now it's mine now
Gotta lie down, been here for a while now
Dig a hole for me, let go of me
You don't know
You know of me
Dont talk bout me
Come close to me
Come close to me
You are scared of me
RIP my hopes and dreams
I don't wanna wake up
We don't fuck with anyone
So you cannot snake us
I'm not here you know I'm gone
I'm about to take off
Rolling up 100 grams every time I wake up
I'm a missing person though
I go off the radar
He's not here with us, you know
He's a fucking traitor
You want cop some acid bro
I'm selling you paper
I dont care about anything
You know I'm a drainer
Texting all that shit to me it's nothing
He's not Drain Gang, he a lame, fuck him
They gonna approach me like I'm Justin
You know I'm coming
Popping outta nothing
Bitch I know you're bluffing
I don't run from nothing
I'm a fucking junkie
I love wasting money
I think that they love me
I don't love them back though
I'm not coming back bro
I just lost my last hope
RIP my hopes and dreams
I don't wanna wake up
We don't fuck with anyone
So you cannot snake us
I'm not here you know I'm gone
I'm about to take off
Rolling up 100 grams every time I wake up
I'm a missing person though
I go off the radar
He's not here with us, you know
He's a fucking traitor
You want cop some acid bro
I'm selling you paper
I dont care about anything
You know I'm a drainer
