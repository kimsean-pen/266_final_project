There goes another day and I wonder why
You and I keep tellin' lies
I can't believe what you say
'Cause tomorrow's lullaby can't pacify my lonesome cryin'

Make believe is all you know and to make believe is a game
A child's rein, you've changed your name
So sadly I watched the show as you seen what you became
Truth is the shame, too much pain

There goes another day and I wonder why
You and I keep tellin' lies
