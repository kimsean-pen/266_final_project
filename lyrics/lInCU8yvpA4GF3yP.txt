I have never faced the different ways that would make us losers or winners
Never mind if time would turn into race
But I feel it runs through my fingers
If I travel to the end of the world
There'll be place I'll always remember
I'm not afraid because I won't be alone
I always knew that we don't belong there

Old times
It was good but I won't try to get it back
World is colored into something black
Sky is gray
I can't explain
Cause our hearts drown in the rain

Love's the only thing I have
I'm afraid it's too late
Test my fate
I need to run away
From this town we go down
Going round lost in dawn

The old times will never end
The old times will never end
Old time
Old time
