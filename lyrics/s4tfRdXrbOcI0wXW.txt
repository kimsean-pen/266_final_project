I would hate to imagine
The? that should have been
My whole world would just blur
If you were not in it, girl

The demons would reappear
With no will to perservere
My whole world would just blur
If you were not in it, girl

I would hate to imagine
The? that should have been
My whole world would just blur
If you were not in it, girl

My whole world would just blur
My whole world would just blur
My whole world would just blur

If you were not in it, girl

My whole world would just blur
If you were not in it, girl

My whole world would just blur
If you were not in it, girl
