Your mum created you a small heaven
I was there just an hour
I could tell that you'd be leaving
So cruelly beyond all our power

Go Heavenward
Like all earth angels should
Go Heavenward
Like all earth angels should

I'm gonna celebrate you forever
You taught us things we all should learn
I'm gonna celebrate you forever
And long to see you when it's my turn

Go heavenward
Like all Earth angels should
Go heavenward
Like all Earth angels should

See you dancing on
You dancing on
See you dancing on
You dancing on
See you dancing on
You dancing on
See you dancing on
You dancing on
