sun shines on my face
how it's golden design
rain falls in this place
and the fields come alive
days are only rumours we've wasted
we cross the millions
we'll see where we stand
for removed from the romb
will you carry me across the sea?
will you cary me?
we can drink from the fountains
and the teste of truth
for removed from the womb
rhythm and mind
don't waste no time
want to let it all out
when the chains fall off
and the walls fall down
when we break the seal
and our hearts pour out
when the frozen ground
comes alive around us
with a scream
