On on baby I got your back

1st verse
I sit here waiting
Just so I can see your face
Full of anticipation
I just wanna call your name
You got me scared to make a move
You got me nervous 'cause it's new
But I'm still waiting

Chorus
Even though the journey seems so far
No matter where you are
I wanna be close to you
Time with you may seem so far away
But patience has a say
I wanna be close to you

2nd verse
Nothing's complicated
I know just how I feel for you
And finally I found a way
To give you all I have
Our love can't be misunderstood, boy 'cause it's too good
I know you read me like a book
That's why we made it

Chorus (x 2)
Even though the journey seems so far...

Breakdown
On on baby I got your back
On on baby I got your back

Chorus (x 2)
Even though the journey seems so far...
