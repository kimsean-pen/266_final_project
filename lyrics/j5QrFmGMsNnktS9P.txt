She's standing on the corner
like an angel in disguise
when I look a little closer
she's got dangerous eyes
she tells me shes a model
with international reputation
sliding in a bottle
for some stipulation
Shes so indecipherable
shes holds the key to the missing code
just the thought of her touch my mind EXPLODES boom
So desirable, time never will unfold
oh Oh OH
THE RIDDLE OF THE MODEL
oriental choons
The odds are against her
In this little city
Shes got a taste for adventure
And she knows shes pretty
Shes the face of an angel
with the heart of a sinner
if you play with danger
then how you gonna win her
Shes so indecipherable
shes holds the key to the missing gold
just the thought of her touch my mind EXPLODES boom
So desirable, time never will unfold
Ill never unravel
THE RIDDLE OF THE MODEL
