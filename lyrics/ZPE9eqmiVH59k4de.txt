SHIT!
SHIT!

I've been hiding here for a thousand years,
waiting for your ghost
I've been hiding here for a thousand years,
waiting for your ghost

YOUR LIFE'S ABOUT TO FLASH BEFORE YOUR EYES
YOUR LIFE'S ABOUT TO FLASH BEFORE YOUR EYES

Stand your ground,
this is ancient land
I was guided here
by the spirits hand

We shall meet,
at Hells gate
This is fate
THIS IS FATE
this is fate
THIS IS FATE

Not all is lost the spirits shriek
You will be hunted WE SHALL SEEK
Perserverance, turn the page
Enter Shikari Enter Shikari

We're not hiding
WE'RE NOT HIDING
We're not hiding
WE'RE NOT HIDING
We're not hiding now
WE'RE NOT HIDING NOW

I'm in the zone

ALLRIIIGHT!

And still we will be here,
standing like statues
AND STILL WE WILL BE HERE,
STANDING LIKE STATUES
