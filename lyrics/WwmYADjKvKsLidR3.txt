Oh . . . America

We know when you're sleeping, and when you're awake
But if you've been good, you need not be afraid
It's best not to question, the things that you're told
'Cause we have got everything under con, under control

Just relax . . .

Ain't no evidence that can shake our beliefs
And if you don't like it, well you can just leave
If you think George Washington evolved from an ape
You should be locked up, in the 51st State

Oh . . . America

As we're multiplying, the world's on the brink
But that's just what the Devil wants you to think
Don't ever stop shoppin' don't ever give in
'Cause if we stop shoppin' the terrorists win

We know when you're sleeping, and when you're awake
But if you've been good, you need not be afraid
It's best not to question, the things that you're told
'Cause we have got everything under con, under control

We're reading your mail, and tapping your phone
And if you don't like it, we'll send in the drones
Oh say can you see, the twilight's last gleam
The land of the free, the home of the naive

Oh . . . America
