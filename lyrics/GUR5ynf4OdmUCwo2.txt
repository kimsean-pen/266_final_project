Hey mamma when you leave,
Don't leave a thing behind.
I don't want nothin',
Who can use nothin'?

Take care onto the hole.
If you see my friends,
tell 'em: I'm fine.
Not use and nothin'.
Almost burnt out my eyes,
Through my ears down to the floor.
Didn't see nothin',
Didn't hear nothin'.

Stood there like a black Stone,
don't know all I had to know.
Nothin' more.
My aim's nothin'.

Brothers are, troubles are
Locked in each other's heart.
You better pray,
They'll never find you.

Sit back ain't strong enough,
Burden's double foe.
It crushes you down,
Down into nothin'.
Being born is going black,
By down as a tight.
But it goes strong
On your temptation.

Sorrow and solitude,
These are the precious things,
The only words,
That are worth remembered.
