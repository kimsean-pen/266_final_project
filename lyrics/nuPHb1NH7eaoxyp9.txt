Why you mad?
Talking about you mad
Could it be that you just lost the best you've ever had
That's your bag
Yup that's too bad
Show is over you ain't gotta act
Name hold weight like kilos
Boy you acting so corny like Fritos
Wouldn't have none of that without me, though
Ain't none of my business, this tea though
Outta ammo, gotta reload
If life was a game you a free throw
It's nothing that you don't already know
Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There's an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity
How I say this
Fact that you still exist
No disrespect
On second thought it truly, truly is
Truthfully I'm through with this
Why are we still doing this
Answer the phone like, "Who is this?"
Take your head and knock some sense
Je ne comprends pas
Ain't no compliments
Ain't no being friends
Ain't no false pretence
Ain't no make amends
Ain't no come agains
That's the story ain't no happy ends
Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There's an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity
Is it lack of ice got you so cold?
Have you ever felt this on your own?
Why you trying to play like you're so grown?
Everything you own boy you still owe
Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There's an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity
You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
'Cause I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream
I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream
Infinity, Infinity...
