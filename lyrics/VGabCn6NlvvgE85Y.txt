Growing up
Saw a lot
Some shift lifts me up
But not enough
Getting much and giving up
It's not enough
It's not enough
We still don't have enough

I'm on my way
And I'm thinking that
We are not enough
And we don't have enough
Guess it's okay to admit that
We are not enough
And we don't have enough

Get scared away from where I stay
I refuse cause they are not enough
And we don't have enough

We tip toe all our way back home
We tip toe all our way back home
We're grinning in your face from ear to ear
We're grinning in your face from ear to ear
And we don't have enough
And we don't have enough
And we don't know what's enough

Growing up
Saw a lot
Some shift lifts me up
But not enough
Getting much and giving up
It's not enough
It's not enough
We still don't have enough

We are just a riddle
And no one works us out
We are stuck in the middle
And no one pulls us out
I'm on my way
And I'm thinking that
We are not enough
And we don't have enough

Get scared away from where I stay
I refuse cause they are not enough
And we don't have enough

We tip toe all our way back home
We tip toe all our way back home
We're grinning in your face from ear to ear
We're grinning in your face from ear to ear
And we don't have enough

We tip toe all our way back home
We tip toe all our way back home
We're grinning in your face from ear to ear
We're grinning in your face from ear to ear
And we don't have enough

And we don't have enough
And we don't know what's enough
And we don't have enough
And we don't know what's enough
