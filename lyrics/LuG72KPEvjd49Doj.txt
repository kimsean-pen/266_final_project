From the time I fall asleep till the mornin' comes
I dream about you, baby
And I feel alright, 'cause I know tonight I'll be with you, baby
And who makes me feel like smilin' when the weary day is through?

(Who?) You, baby, you (I'm talking about my baby, yeah)
No one but you, baby, nobody but you
(Who?) You, baby, you (I'm talking about my baby, yeah)
No one but you, baby, nobody but you

They say candy is sweet, but it just can't compete with you, baby
You've got everything I need
And nobody can please like you, you, baby
And who believes that my wildest dreams
And my craziest schemes will come true?

(Who?) You, baby, you (I'm talking about my baby, yeah)
No one but you, baby, nobody but you
(Who?) You, baby, you (I'm talking about my baby, yeah)
No one but you, baby, nobody but you

A little ray of sunshine, a little bit of soul, yeah
Add just a touch of magic
It's the greatest thing since rock 'n' roll

(Yeah, baby, you) You, baby, you (I'm talking about my baby, yeah)
No one but you, baby, nobody but you
(You) You, baby, you
No one but you, baby, nobody but you
(You) You, baby, you (I'm talking about my baby, yeah)
No one but you, baby, nobody but you
