She sipped tea
In a garden of frozen leaves
As she sat on her darkened knees
Underneath the sun
She slept on
Where the hills are in rolling form
Far away from the city norm
Beneath the morning sun

She thought of him everyday
She pictured him everyday

He drinks tea
Called me three times a day
Always in a business way
Living on the run
He had plans
A memory blocked her soul
Didn't see them often though
'Cause they're on the run

He thought of her everyday
He pictured her everyday

He met her
Hanging [in?] in the sand
He was in his business and
Working over key
She asked him
To visit her farm someday
They could be on her lawn someday
Giving [?] come

They never would meet again
They never would meet again
Compromised, doesn't have any friends
And they never would meet again
