I Paint My Skin A Shallow Grey
Teeth less I will Start To Pray
Restless Eyes Closed Tonight
No Images From The Other Side

I Claw Towards...
I Claw Towards An Unknown Truth
And An Open Book Before Me I Lay
Blank Pages Read The History

I Read Into...
I Read Into The Leaves
And With Pain I Paint On My Skin
Coloring The Blood Within

The Grains Of Dirt I Do Count
And Pillars Of Time I Will Mount
Yes These Pillars
These Pillars I Ascend

And Thus I See
There Is No Ocean Before Me
And Tho' I Weep
No Tears Shall Drop On The Soil

And I Try To Breathe
And I Try To Hear
I Try To See
But No Tears Shall Drop On The Soil

I Paint My Skin A Shallow Grey
Teeth less I Will Start To Pray
Restless Eyes Closed Tonight
No Images From The Other Side

The Grains Of Dirt I do Count
And Pillars Of Time I Will Mount
Yes These Pillars
These Pillars I Ascend
