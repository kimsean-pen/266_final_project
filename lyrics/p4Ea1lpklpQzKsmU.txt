Like fading pictures, I'm starting to lose hope
Of anything to show right now
I'm waiting out the cold
If I scream my lungs out, would you be listening?
You'll be sorry when you see the hell I bring
You said it all, yet you wrote it in a letter
It's impossible for things to not get better
What kills me the most when the knife gets twisted
We follow fate, that's how it begins
I'm about to burn these bridges
Cross you out and cut you off again
Like shattered dreams, this routine's getting old
I'm losing grip of everyone, I just do what I'm told
When the curtain closes, all I am is me
That's my only way out of this tragedy
You said it all, yet you wrote it in a letter
It's impossible for things to not get better
What kills me the most when the knife gets twisted
We follow fate, that's how it begins
I'm about to burn these bridges
Cross you out and cut you off again
You showed me no reason
For ever thinking twice
Breathing seems like the only really good advice
Don't test my patience
Who knows when I might implode
No more variation of the truth
I'm ready to take on
This dark, unapologetic world
What kills me the most when the knife gets twisted
What kills me the most when the knife gets twisted
Like fading pictures, I'm starting to lose hope
Of anything to show right now
I'm waiting out the cold
If I scream my lungs out, would you be listening?
You'll be sorry when you see the hell I bring
What kills me the most when the knife gets twisted
We follow fate, that's how it begins
I'm about to burn these bridges
Cross you out and cut you off again
You showed me no reason
For ever thinking twice
Breathing seems like the only really good advice
