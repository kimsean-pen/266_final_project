Every day i see you
My hands were made for you
And you always give me stress me free point of view
Pick you up after school

[Chorus:]
(Mr. Magic) Take a token
(Mr. Magic) Of my love
(Mr. Magic) I see you through the smoke

Without you, a misery
Blue with a migraine
All the songs sound better when you're next to me
Hey, coz they come naturally

[Chorus]

Laying on my bed
I reach over for you
And you so fresh you even make the standards bloom
But its just to you through

[Chorus]

(Mr. Magic)
(Mr. Magic)
(Mr. Magic)
Waiting for the smoke to clear.
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear
