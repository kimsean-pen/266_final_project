These words are my own
Threw some chords together
The combination D-E-F
It's who I am, it's what I do
And I was gonna lay it down for you

Try to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration
But it's not coming easily

Trying to find the magic (Woah oh)
Trying to write a classic (Woah oh)
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know? (Woah oh)
Waste-bin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own
From my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you

Read some Byron, Shelley and Keats
Recited it over a Hip-Hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean
With dead poets and drum machines

You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find a killer hook
Now you've gone and raised the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough

These words are my own (These words are my own)
From my heart flow (Heart flow)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you

These words are my own
From my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you

I'm getting off my stage
The curtains pull away
No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked soul exposes

Trying to find the magic
Trying to write a classic
Waste-bin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own
From my heart flow (Don't you know)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you

These words are my own
From my heart flow (From my heart)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you

These words are my own
From my heart
I love you, I love you
That's all I got to say
Can't think of a better way
And that's all I've got to say
I love you, is that okay?
