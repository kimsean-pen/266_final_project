You must think I'm a fool
So prosaic and awkward and all
Do you think you've got me down?
Do you think I've never been out of this town?

Do I seem too eager to please to you now?
You don't know me at all
I can't turn it on turn it off like you now
No I'm not like you now

Now you're here
I bet you're wishing you could disappear
I'm trying to be kind
I get the feeling you're just killing time

You look down at me
Don't you look down at me now
You don't know me at all
A slap in the face, in the face for you now
Just might do now

You're leaving so soon?
Never had a chance to bloom
But you were so quick to change your tune
Don't look back if I'm a weight around your neck
Because if you don't need me, I don't need you

Leaving so soon?
Leaving, leaving so soon?

You're leaving so soon?
Never had a chance to bloom
But you were so quick to change your tune
Don't look back if I'm a weight around your neck
Because if you don't need me, I don't need you
