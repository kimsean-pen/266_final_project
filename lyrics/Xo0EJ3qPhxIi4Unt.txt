Can't reach yea such a sweet lie
Hard knowing whatcha gunna be like
When your ocean conditioner starts to predict
All I know is that you'll be there
Know you'll always be there
And if and every time

Can't reach in the inner short sounds
Constantly moving between
Your causing dead land

Protecting a section of sea from the wind
Run with me my good friends
I know you'll always be there
And the same all the time

Can't reach sorry what we're doing
Carelessy wasting this rapid lil limosine
And doing so losing your soul
And burning a hole with cold
I swear it's not me I'm too small

I swear it's not me I'm too small
How can that affect anything at all?
I'm one in six billion I can't be at fault
How could that affect anything at all?

I swear it's not me I'm too small
How could that affect anything at all?
I'm one in six billion pixels that have evolved
Eating your skin but I'm not involved

I swear it's not me I'm too small
How could that affect anything at all?
I'm one in six billion no way I'm at fault
I swear it's not me I'm too small

And growing all the time

Can't reach yea such a sweet lie
Hard knowing whatcha gunna be like
