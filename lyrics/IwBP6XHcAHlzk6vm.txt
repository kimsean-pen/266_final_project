Yaw!
...
Old prophet's land
A battlefield!
Of non-believers, in a violent rage

...
A declaration of human rights, a pretext
For maintenance of a new world order
...
Above all written laws a growth concept
Created by the patriot of the civilized world

...
Rearmament
...
Welfare state
...

Disarmament
...
Non-member state

...
Free market economy a consequence
Of military needs
Loss of lives

Human rights activists, political pawn in a game
Nothing can they do, without state subsidies
...
Yaw
A gift, of today's world
Heroes to us, heroes to us, heroes to us!
Heroes to us, heroes to us, heroes to us!
Solo -Antti Kokko
Yaaaaaaw
...
Production, at any price
Admiration, of those who earn
Argh, with blood on their hands
We will never learn
...
Yaaw
A gift, of today's world
Heroes to us, heroes to us, heroes to us!
Heroes to us, heroes to us, heroes to us!
