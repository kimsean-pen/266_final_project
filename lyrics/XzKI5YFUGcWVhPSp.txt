I get a rep for breakin' hearts
Now I'm done with superstars
And all the tears on her guitar
I'm not bitter
But now I see
Everything I'd ever need
Is the girl in front of me
She's much better

You
I wanna fly with
You
Tear up the sky with
You
You're much better
You
I wanna fight with
You
Make up tonight with
You

You're much better

Now I've got some enemies
And they're all friends suddenly
BFF's eternally
But I'm not bitter
I believe that the road that people lead
Helps you find the one you need

You're much better
Yeah

You
I wanna fly with
You
Tear up the sky with
You
You're much better
You're much better, girl
You
I wanna fight with
You
Make up tonight with

You

You're much better
Ooh, yeah

You
I wanna fly with
You
Tear up the sky with you
You
Oh, you're much better
You
I wanna fight with you
You
Make up tonight with you

You
Oh-oh, you're much better
You're much better, girl

Ooh-ooh-hoo (You)
Yow
You
I wanna fight with you

You
Oh-oh-oh (You're much better)
You're much better, girl
Oh

You
You
You
You're much better
You
You
You
You're much better
