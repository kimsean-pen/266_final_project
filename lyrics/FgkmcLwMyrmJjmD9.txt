Sentinel of the retribution
Summoner of the dying light
Guardian of the grand delusion
Phosphorus and apatite
She's observed you
From the other world
She has heard you
Every world unfurled
Soon she is coming
Soon she'll descend
First we're devolving
Then we'll ascend
And I know it's the only way out of here
That lies ahead
And I know that she will get us off
This planet of the dead
Oversight of the everwatching
Vigilance of the seldom seen
Sulphurous dawn is soon approaching
Promises of what might have been
Unshed tears
Cascading from her interstellar space
Disconnected from the earth
And all that we embraced
She's observed you
From the other world
She has heard you
Every world unfurled
Soon she is coming
Soon she'll descend
First we're devolving
Then we'll ascend
And I know it's the only way out of here
That lies ahead
And I know that she will get us off
This planet of the dead
She's observed you
From the other world
She has heard you
Every world unfurled
Soon she is coming
Soon she'll descend
First we're devolving
Then we'll ascend
And I know it's the only way out of here
That lies ahead
And I know that she will get us off
This planet of the dead
