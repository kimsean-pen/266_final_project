1010 via the two houses

Baby, fade away, feel the feeling more
Or a hole in my head, feel the feeling more
Lots of maybe's, I don't wanna go on
Bein' a hole in my head, ultimaybe

Baby, fade away, feel the feeling more
Or a hole in my head, feel the feeling more
Lots of maybe's, I don't wanna go on
Bein' a hole in my head, ultimaybe

I like to think that you're walking' and talkin'
But I don't think you do anymore (Oh no, my light)
I'd like to see that you're so damn shockin'
Position me very low, oh
Baby, bless me, feed the feeling more
On a bed to my heart, ultimaybe (bitch)
Ultra navy, I don't want to go on
Bein' a hole in my head, ultimaybe (I like it)

Yeah, first she makes me see far-sighted demons
A new girl with an ex for a head, yeah
I like your passion, it's hot and it's steamy
It keeps me out of her bed, oh

A lot of people be walking' and talkin'
They want it all for themselves, oh, oh
A lot of people become shockin', rockin'
I need you, girl, to be chill, oh

Baby, fade away, feel the feeling more
Or a hole in my head, feel the feeling more
Lots of maybe's, I don't wanna go on
Bein' a hole in my head, ultimaybe

Baby, fade away, feel the feeling more
Or a hole in my head, feel the feeling more
Lots of maybe's, I don't wanna go on
Bein' a hole in my head, ultimaybe
