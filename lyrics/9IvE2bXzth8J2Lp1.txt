Hey mister
Your eyes are full of hesitation
Make me wonder
What you're looking for
Maybe I want to know
Keep my reputation
And sensation
You try me once you beg for more

Yes sir
I can boogie
If you play a certain song
Yes sir
I can boogie
All night long

And I don't know how
It will begin
I want to my everything we do
I don't know how
Long I will stay
You just keep doing it your own way

Yes sir
I can boogie
If you stay you can go round
Yes sir
I can boogie
All night long
Yes sir
I can boogie
If you stay you can go round
Yes sir
I can boogie
All night long
Yes sir
Yes sir
Yes sir
I can boogie
Yes sir
