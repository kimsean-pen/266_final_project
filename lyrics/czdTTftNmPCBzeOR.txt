Thought that i saw you in a bar
Sat in the corner, just to watch you from the far
I lost your face and fell asleep
Into a dream of echoed voices from the deep

Oooooh you swallow me inside
Like the dark swallows the light
When I'm drowning in your sea
Ooooh the ocean that I've cried
Running back into my eyes
For I'm not the one you need

So i woke when night was gone
Thought that i dream I found the reason to move on
I lost the words i had to say
Fell like into the dream i had the other day

Oooooh you swallow me inside
Like the dark swallows the light
When I'm drowning in your sea
Ooooh the ocean that I've cried
Running back into my eyes
For I'm not the one you need

Now I don't know where to go, no I don't know where to go
Can you Show me where to go
Don't leave!

Now that i saw you in a bar
Sat in the corner, just to watch you from the far
I lost your face and fell asleep
Into my dream of rising colors from the deep
