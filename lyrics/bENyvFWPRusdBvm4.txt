Well how you shake it so easily
and how you drift so slow
Where were you when i was down
where were you when i couldn't stay
where were you when my hand shook
give me a chance and I'll open the door
just don't drift off too easily
work just a little bit more
Take my hand it's shaking lord
write my mother so she knows
How you shake it so easily
and how you drift so slow
Get drink our pour it down your throat
Feel you heartbeat nice and slow
Lay down and close your eyes
here is your chance to take control
just don't drift off too easily
work just a little bit more
take my hand it's shaling lord
write my mother so she knows
