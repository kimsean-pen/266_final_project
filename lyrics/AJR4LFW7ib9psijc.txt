If I could make a wish, I think I'd pass
Can't think of anything I need
No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound
Nothing to eat, no books to read
Making love with you

Has left me peaceful, warm and tired
What more could I ask
There's nothing left, to be desired
Peace came upon me
And it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent angel

Go to sleep
Sometimes
All I need is the air
That I breathe
And to love you

All I need is the air
That I breathe

Just to love you
All I need is the air
That I breathe
Peace came upon me
And it leaves me weak

So sleep silent angel
Go to sleep
Sometimes
All I need is the air
That I breathe
And to love you
All I need is the air
That I breathe
Just to love you
All I need is the air
That I breathe
Sometimes
All I need is the air
That I breathe
And to love you
All I need is the air
That I breathe
Just, to love you
All I need is the air
That I breathe
