This ain't a little mascara running down my cheek
And this ain't a little scratch that'll heal in a couple of weeks
This is more than a little smile I'm having to fake
'Cause this ain't no little girl heartache

Standing by your man
That's a broken plan
When he breaks your heart
And all your trust
With his two cheating hands
So it's D-I-V, O-R-C-E
And you don't want him to see you crying
So you're crying in the rain
And this is Tammy Wynette
We're talking Tammy Wynette
Kind of pain

There's a sky full of tears and every single note
And every single word is wine and whiskey soaked
So I guess it's me and her, together in this alone
Till I can make it on my own

Standing by your man
Oh that's a broken plan
When he breaks your heart
And all your trust
With his two cheating hands
So it's D-I-V, O-R-C-E
And you don't want him to see you crying
So you're crying in the rain
And this is Tammy Wynette
We're talking Tammy Wynette
Kind of pain

Standing by your man
Well that's a broken plan
When he breaks your heart
And all your trust
With his two cheating hands
And it's D-I-V, O-R-C-E
Means this golden wedding ring
Don't mean a thing
Oh this is Tammy Wynette
This is Tammy Wynette
We're talking Tammy Wynette
Kind of pain
