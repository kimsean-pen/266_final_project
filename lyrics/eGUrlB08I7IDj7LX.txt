Somebody said
"Hey, slow down. Wait for me.
Why wait for me at all?"
Then I said, "There's a person willingly will leave.
We'll follow him too far."

While we're marching in a circle
There's a fire in your eyes
Fire is come to burn the truth, burns all
While we wait around to die

Hold me closer, break your trembling
Never thought I'd see you cry
Now I steal a kiss young ladies
And prepare to watch them fly
