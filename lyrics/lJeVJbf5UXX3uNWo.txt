Deadly nightshade
Poison hemlock
Feathered serpent
Born from teardrops

Some say she's crazy
To others she's wise
To you she brings trouble
In a beguiling guise

The answers she seeks
You pretend to know
But the path she walks
You cannot follow

Deadly nightshade
Poison hemlock
Feathered serpent
Born from teardrops

Wild and free
Like waves on the shore
She may love you for a while
But she will never be yours

Her promise is empty
Though your love be true
Her heart is full
And there's no room for you

Deadly nightshade
Poison hemlock
Feathered serpent
Born from teardrops

Wild and free
Like waves on the shore
She may love you for a while
But she will never be yours
