Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night
Free as a breeze, not to mention the trees
Whistling tunes that you know and love so

Southern nights
Just as good even when you close your eyes
I apologize to anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies
It's precious beauty lies
Just beyond the eye it goes running through your soul
Like the stories of old

Old man, he and his dog
That walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weeping willows would cry for joy, joy

Feel so good, feel so good,
It's frightening wish I could
Stop this world from fighting

La da da da da...
Mysteries like this and
Many others in the trees

Blow in the night in the Southern skies
Southern nights
They feel so good,
It's frightening wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
La da da da da...
