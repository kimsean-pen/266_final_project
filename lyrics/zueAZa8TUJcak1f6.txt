Are you ready?
Are you ready?

I get shoppin sprees off the heezy
I get dough to blow, please believe me
Don't want the one on one
Take it easy
You're just the jump-off
I'm his breezy
I'm the one who knows him the best
That's my name that's tatted on his chest
Don't wanna take it there
Don't you see
He told me he loves me
Calls me his breezy

Let me break it down, break it down
I got it on lock and
I think you better stop
I heard you been checkin for my boo
Do ya thing, get busy
Give it your best shot
But you couldn't get a call back
And even after all that
Caught you at the mall for a throwback
That's big pimpin' but you
Wouldn't listen, he's mine
Not yours better fall back

I get shoppin sprees off the heezy
I get dough to blow, please believe me
Don't want the one on one
Take it easy
You're just the jump-off
I'm his breezy
I'm the one who knows him the best
That's my name that's tatted on his chest
Don't wanna take it there
Don't you see
He told me he loves me
Calls me his breezy

Now I'mma let ya know to your face
You needa hit the brakes
Your about to make a major mistake
Call you out, no doubt
Let me spell it out
Baby you ain't nothin but a fake
Cause I know what you want
And you ain't gotta front
So go ahead and pull another stunt
Remember that it's me that he loves
All he's thinkin of
I'm the only one that he wants

I get shoppin sprees off the heezy
I get dough to blow, please believe me
Don't want the one on one
Take it easy
You're just the jump-off
I'm his breezy
I'm the one who knows him the best
That's my name that's tatted on his chest
Don't wanna take it there
Don't you see
He told me he loves me
Calls me his breezy

Cause what we have is so real
It's more than just dollar bills
This livin' lavish
Wouldn't matter if I didn't have his heart
Shorty, he's mine
Better luck next time

I get shoppin sprees off the heezy
I get dough to blow, please believe me
Don't want the one on one
Take it easy
You're just the jump-off
I'm his breezy
I'm the one who knows him the best
That's my name that's tatted on his chest
Don't wanna take it there
Don't you see
He told me he loves me
Calls me his breezy

I get shoppin sprees off the heezy
I get dough to blow, please believe me
