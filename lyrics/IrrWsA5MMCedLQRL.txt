Tell my mom that I'm sorry
I just popped an Oxy
Tell my mom that I'm sorry
I'm just fucking flossing
Tell my mom that I'm sorry
I just popped another Oxy
Tell my mom that I'm sorry
I'm just fucking flossing

Tear-stained racks all up on my floor
I don't know if I can do this anymore
You'll be fine without me
You'll be fine without me
Tear-stained racks all on my floor
I don't know if I can do this anymore
You'll be fine without me
You'll be fine without me
I been ballin'
I been ballin'
I been ballin'
Was in the bleachers, now you know I'm shot-calling
Three-gram blunt and I face it
I'm next up, please just face it
Fuck a bitch, I won't chase it
I just want cash so I chase it
Blow a bag then replace it
Fuck all that shit that they're saying
Flex up on them, now they hating
Pour a four, now I'm skating
Tear-stained racks all on my floor
I don't know if I can do this anymore
You'll be fine without me
You'll be fine without me
I been ballin'
I been ballin'
I been ballin'
Was in the bleachers, now you know I'm shot-calling

Tell my mom that I'm sorry
I just popped an Oxy
Tell my mom that I'm sorry
I'm just fucking flossing
Tell my mom that I'm sorry
I just popped another Oxy
Tell my mom that I'm sorry
I'm just fucking flossing
