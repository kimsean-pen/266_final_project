I can't stay much longer, Melinda
The sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles
If you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down
Gotta get down to mine

You keep me up just one more night
I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight
You kept me up till four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down
Or I can't work there no more

A lotta poor man make a five dollar bill
Keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's makin' nothin' at all
And you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down
Take your shift at the mine?"

Gotta get down to the Cumberland Mine
Gotta get down to the Cumberland Mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

Lotta poor man got the Cumberland Blues
He can't win for losin'
Lotta poor man got to walk the line
Just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know
If I'm goin' back again
I don't know now, I just don't know
If I'm goin' back again
I don't know now, I just don't know
If I'm goin' back again
