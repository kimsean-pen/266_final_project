A still framed photograph of you and me together
Is all I have of me and you anymore
We were so in love and we thought it'd last forever
But in the storm we were torn

And I won't forget you
I don't regret you
The hardest thing I've had to do is live without you
And I wonder why we both walked away
I'm lost without you, still crazy for you
Just turn around, come back because your smile is overdue
And I miss, I miss you
If I only knew the words to say

That would make you turn around (turn around)
I would say those words to you more than a million times
It's been forever but

That hasn't changed
What you mean to me
Darling can't you see?

That I won't forget you

I don't regret you
And the hardest thing I've had to do is live without you
And I wonder why we both walked away (we walked away)
I'm lost without you, still crazy for you
Just turn around, come back because your smile is overdue
And I miss, I miss you
I'm sorry for all I did
What I said and things I hid

I'm finally over me
Is that too late for you?
I can't imagine where I'd be
If you had never rescued me
You gave me hope to live
And I need you, yes I need you
I won't forget you
I don't regret you
The hardest thing I've had to do is live without you
And I wonder why we both walked away (we walked away)
I'm lost without you, still crazy for you
Just turn around, come back because your smile is overdue
And I miss, I miss you
