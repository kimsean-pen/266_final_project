I waste all my time on you
Your necklace swings in the view
Now I want to buy one too
I ask you to help me out
Even when I, I know how
To do what I asked of you

If only
Being honest
The thought of you is swimming back and forth in my head
'Cause you're always
What I wanted
I wonder if you'll ever find your way to my bed

Tell me if there's something
Tell me if there's something you need
(Ooh wee, ooh wee)
Tell me if you're hungry
Milkshake with some eggs and bacon, baby
(Ooh wee, ooh wee)
Let me show, let me show, let me know
Let me show you just how much I can do, ooh wee
(Ooh wee, ooh wee)
Tell me if there's something
Explain it to me, whatever you need
(Ooh wee, ooh wee)

I sit on a step below
But I keep enough room for you
In case you come along
When I laugh I touch your arm
I read that that helps a lot
With showing you what I want

Do, do, give it to me, ooh wee
Do, give it, do, give it, do wee
Do, give it give it to me, ooh wee
Do, give it give it, ooh wee

You shook something loose
Somewhere inside of me
Like ooh wee
Lik ooh wee

I'm speaking the truth
You always get to me
Like ooh wee
Like ooh wee
