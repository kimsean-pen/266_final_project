As the feeling fades away, the tearin' streets create a wave
Of never seein' stills in time a sway of settled lines
The creepin' sounds of children ring to curlin' toes this spring
Well, they now are lapsed 'round you and me

They now are lapsed 'round you and me

So yet, we flow together
And with the changin' in time, we flow together
So yet, we flow together
And with the change of it all, we float together
Well, so yet we
I was passin' the thrill of none
Onto the streets below
For many cares were taken for the Dillinger beats of the feet
And a terrible impression today
Upon the chorus and plated alleyways

That kept up all together
And they kept us all together

As the feeling fades away, the tearin' streets create a wave
Of never seein' stills in time a sway of settled lines
The creepin' sounds of children ring to curlin' toes this spring
Well, they now are lapsed 'round you and me

It kept up all together
They now are lapsed 'round you and me
And it kept us all together
They now are lapsed 'round you and me
And it kept us all together

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
