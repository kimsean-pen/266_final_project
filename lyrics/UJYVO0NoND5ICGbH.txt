I can hear you breathing
I've slipped out of time again
Leaving all of you behind
And I'm free
To return to the place where I already am
And have always been
If I just really looked and allowed myself
To see

Confusion is seducing me warm flowing wine
His eyes summer
Hypnotize they see inside of me
Hot swollen skin want me take me perfect embrace
Black and bloody
Rotten and perfect
The center has moved on and all that's left is free
Finally
Finally
Everyone seems to be asleep but me

Take me
Into the arms of the lovers
Take me
Into the arms of the lovers

Oh I see you floating there
How could I ever hope to forget
Always rearranging messages
Those words are a lie a mirror reflecting in a mirror of a lie
A light shines still always
Shadows in every word
Beneath black eaves
Please don't leave me here
I could stop it
Maybe I could stop it if I wanted to
But I'm not the one driving anymore
I know who I am
But I know who I am
Right?
Please take me there with you

Take me
Into the arms of the lovers
Free
Into the arms of a lover
Into the arms of the lovers
Please
Into the arms of a lover
I am free
Into the arms of the lovers
