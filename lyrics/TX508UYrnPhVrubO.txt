Are you blind?
Blind to me trying to be kind
Volunteering for your firing line
Waiting for one precious sign

The flicker of a smile
You should try it just once in a while
Baby, it's not quite your style
It's simply too easy to do
And you might not see it through
See it through

Oh, so find yourself another place to fall
Find yourself up against another brick wall
See yourself as a fallen angel
Well, I don't see no holes in the road but you
Find another place to fall

Are you proud?
To have founded a brand new behavior
With hatred and hurt as your Savior
But nobody's choosing to follow
So you choke back the tears and you swallow

Men who have ruined your life
If you consume them with minimum strife
Now you have got indigestion
The antacid comes as a question

Oh, so find yourself another place to fall
Find yourself up against another brick wall
See yourself as a fallen angel
Well, I don't see no holes in the road but you
Find another place to fall

There isn't much more I can say
For I don't understand the delay
You're asking for friendly advice
And remaining in permanent crisis

Affection is yours if you ask
First you must take off your mask
When your back's turned I've decided
You'll throw it away just like I did

Oh, so find yourself another place to fall
Find yourself up against another brick wall
See yourself as a fallen angel
Well, I don't see no holes in the road but you
Find another place to fall

Well, I don't see no holes in the road but you
Find another place to fall
Well, I don't see no holes in the road but you
Find another place to fall
Well, I don't see no holes in the road but you
Find another place to fall
