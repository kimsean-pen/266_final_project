It'll leave you with nothin' to say
Lost without a way
Ain't it funny, child, love sometimes leaves you
As dead as yesterday?

Hoping to hold a handful of sunshine
Like a child told it cannot play
Never ever be Lord, love would leave me feeling
As dead as yesterday, yeah

Oh Lord, could You help me find some shelter?
Oh Lord, could You help me find some shelter?
Oh Lord, could You help me find some shelter?
Oh Lord, could You help me find some shelter? Yeah

It'll leave you feeling hollow and helpless
And there is where you'll stay
Ain't it funny, child, love sometimes leaves you
As dead as yesterday?
As dead as yesterday?
As dead as yesterday?
