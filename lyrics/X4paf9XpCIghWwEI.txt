Now, I've seen the void i felt the pain,
I know what's like
How you built a wall,
you grew a way I cannot buy
Your breath slows down, and I don't know what's on your mind
They say "Leave him there" but i'm always looking behind
It's not right,
I care when you bleed,
I don't seem to move on like you've said
You can't fight forever for the feels,
you pulled back,
but I'm still waiting here
You're alone and there's nothing else to
fear but your home, as empty as your dreams
You've got friends and they're all ready to hear,
but when night comes, you shade the same old
Sometimes deep inside i wonder how you're doing now
But please don't say "fine",
I couldn't bear another lie
I'm looking by the window I guess I hope you'll be around
They've got words,
I might need, but i need you more than they thought
It's not right,
I care when you bleed,
I don't seem to move on like you've said
You can't fight forever for the feels,
you pulled back, but I'm still waiting here
You're alone and there's nothing else to fear
but your home, as empty as your dreams
You've got friends and they're all ready to hear,
but when night comes, you shade the same old tears
you shade the same old tears
you shade the same old
