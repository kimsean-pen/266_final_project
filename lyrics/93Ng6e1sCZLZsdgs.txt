One
Two
One, two, three, four
Up on the catwalk
A big wheel is spinning
And dollars to Deutchmarks
And pennies from heaven
And up on the catwalk

There's one hundred million

With letters from thousands

That say "Just who are you?"
There's one thousand names
That can spring up in my mind
But you'd call it blackmail
And that's just not my kind

And up on the catwalk
And up on the catwalk

And I don't know why

I will be there, I will be there
I will be there
I will be there, I will be there

Up on the catwalk there's
Street politicians
That crawl in from Broadway

Say "Then who are you?"
And up on the catwalk there's
One thousand postcards
From Montevideo

Say that I'll be home soon
And get out of Bombay
And go up to Brixton
And, and look around to see

Just what is missing
And up on the catwalk
And girls call for mother
And dream of their boyfriends
And I don't know why
I will be there, I will be there

I will be there
I will be there, I will be there
Tonight, under the crystal light
I'll tell you everything I need
Tonight, under the crystal light
Surrender everything to me
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Up on the catwalk and
You dress in waistcoats
And got brilliantino and
Friends of Kim Philby
And float through the nighttime
Like manna from heaven
But, but what do I know?
And just what do I know?
And up on the catwalk and
In sweat that glistens
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
I don't know why
I will be there, I will be there
I will be there
I will be there, I will be there
Tonight, under the crystal light
I'll tell you everything I need
Tonight, under the crystal light
Surrender everything to me
Angel
Angel
Angel
Angel
Uh-ha
Uh-ha
Uh-ha
Uh-ha
One thousand names that
Spring up in my mind
One thousand names that
Spring up in my mind
Like Deodato
Michaelangelo
Robert de Niro
So many others
Nastassja Kinski
And Martin Luther
There's room for others
Away from me, oh
Up on the catwalk
Up on the catwalk
Up on the catwalk
I don't know why
Up on the catwalk
Up on the catwalk
Up on the catwalk
I don't know why
Up on the catwalk
Up on the catwalk
