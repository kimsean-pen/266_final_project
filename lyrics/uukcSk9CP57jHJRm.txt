[I'm in. 1, ah 2, ah 1, 2, 3.]

I don't want you
But I hate to lose you
You got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

I forgive you
Cos I can't forget you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

I want to cross you off my list
But when you come knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more

I should hate you
But I guess I love you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

I want to cross you off my list
But when you come knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more

I should hate you
But I guess I love you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

You've got me in between
The devil and the deep (The devil and the deep)
The devil and the deep blue sea
