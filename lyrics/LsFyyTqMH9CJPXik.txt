Never meant to cause you trouble with my coloured lies
But you holding me with something locked behind your eyes
And I'll be waiting for it all to take control
you're setting me right
'Cause you got something that I need
Something I can't find

Distance never made me stronger
It tore us apart
And I know I left you questions and a lonely heart
But you've been waiting long enough to let it go
I'll do you right
'Cause time is just a remedy covered in disguise

And all I know
Is that I want you so
Heavy on my mind
And the feelings grow
When you're dancing slow
I see your fire go
Electric indigo

What's it gonna, what's it gonna take?
