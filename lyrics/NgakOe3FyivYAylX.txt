On and on, and on
And on

Yeah I stayed true, I ain't never switched up
And I hate you, acting like a bitch yuh
Yeah I made you, you my little kid bruh
And your girlfriend giving me a kiss huh

Yeah I stayed true, I ain't never switched up
And I hate you, acting like a bitch yuh
Yeah I made you, you my little kid bruh
And your girlfriend giving me a kiss huh

Every morning pop a bean to help me deal with the pain
Why the legends gotta leave and let the terrible stay
Yeah I love you but I'm having such a terrible day
Rip me open 27 on the trip to the grave

Live fast so I'm gonna die fast
Heart attack, terrible car crash
Live fast so I'm gonna die fast
Heart attack, terrible car crash
Yuh

Dreams come true but I got a deathwish (yeah, yeah)

Won't stop till my name at the top of the guest list
Hatin' on me get you god damn death bitch
Billboard 1 with my ass as the press big
Dreams come true but I got a deathwish
Won't stop till my name at the top of the guest list
Hatin' on me get you god damn death bitch
Billboard 1 with my ass as the press big
Dreams come true but I got a deathwish

School sucks, wish you all would leave me alone
Don't you look in my direction, don't be texting my phone
Caused me pain and then you wanna say that you are my bro
Hope you find me when I'm hanging from a tree with a rope

Dreams come true but I got a deathwish
Dreams come true but I got a deathwish
