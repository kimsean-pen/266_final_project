I kinda wanted to leave,
This place I fell in between,
Cause it's a god damn mess,
I guess I got lost in the seams,

I kinda wanted to see,
The places I want to be,
So, let this whole thing come undone,
It's fucking ordinary,

So, hold my hand it's just for a second,
I will be here for all that of a minute,

We are the swords and we are the archers,
We wanted more than a normal structure,
So, live it out for the ones who told us,
To lead a life that we never wanted,

So, keep your heart on your sleeve,
And keep your eyes on the streets,
'Cause it's a godamn long drive home,
Back to normality, (C'MON!)

So, hold my hand it's just for a second,
I will be here for all that of a minute, (?)
I find myself, it's all I ever wanted to see,

We are the swords and we are the archers,
We wanted more than a normal structure,
So, live it out for the ones who told us,
To lead a life that we never wanted,

I saw a light in a cold way glisten,
We'll catch a light and we'll make you listen,
We wanted more than a normal structure,
We are the swords and we are the archers,
(We are the swords and we are the archers)
