Ame into this world, i was lost not found
It did not hold me in its arms like it holds me now
So i dreamed myself a bird who could cross the waves
And i woke up just a man who was miles away

Miles away, miles away, miles away, miles away

So i went to cape canaveral and i went to the moon
And i stayed up there for a year or two
Famous picture of me above the blue parade
A man a million miles up, still miles away

Miles away, miles away, miles away, miles away

So i went back to kansas, it was summertime
Brought flowers to my family by the riverside
At the end of his life, they said my father had changed
I suppose we could have been friends, but i was miles away

Miles away, miles away, miles away, miles away

Honey, you don't belong in a place like this
With your long yellow hair and your hips
But the look in your eye is like the world from sp-ce
The way the sun hits off the water from miles away

Miles away, miles away, miles away, miles away

Honey, can you leave your light on?
Honey, can you leave your light on?
Honey, can you leave your light on?
Honey, can you leave your light on?
I'm miles away, miles away
Miles away, miles away
