Every time I look for you
You're nowhere near, it makes me blue
I swear I need you by my side right now
Forever, baby

Every time I look for you
You're nowhere near, it makes me blue
I swear I need you by my side right now
Forever

I'm glad that I found you
But where did I go?
Why does it matter?
Nobody knows
I'm looking for someone
But she isn't here
Yeah, she's an angel
She's nowhere near
Stepped below the surface
Tryna find my way out
But even if I make it through
There's no one around
I thought that I saw you
You never let go
This world got the best of us
What do you know

Every time I look for you
You're nowhere near, it makes me blue
I swear I need you by my side right now
Forever, baby

Every time I look for you
You're nowhere near, it makes me blue
I swear I need you by my side right now
Forever
