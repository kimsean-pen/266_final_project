I can't quite contain or explain my evil ways
Or explain why I'm not sane
All I can say is this is your warning
I can't quite contain or explain my evil ways
Or explain why I'm not sane
All I can say is this is your warning

Duality
I have a confession that you will not believe
That you could not perceive this freak, gonna set it off
I have a confession, of a side that I hide

It's a cloak or disguise unleashed, gonna get it off
No, I'll never get away
Cause if I try to stray
It only holds me closer
No, I'll never get away
I'll have it any way

I'll never stop
I can't quite contain or explain my evil ways
Or explain why I'm not sane
All I can say is this is your warning
I can't quite contain or explain my evil ways
Or explain why I'm not sane

All I can say is this is your warning
Duality
Du-duality
Du-duality

I have an impression, in the back of my mind
For the black in my tie contains our dirty thoughts
Make me an obsession, when you lock me inside
For the ride of your life unleashed, gonna get it off
No, can't count the list of things
I know are wrong with me

No need to justify them
No, I'll never take the blame
So I'll just stay the same
I'll never stop
I can't quite contain or explain my evil ways
Or explain why I'm not sane

All I can say is this is your warning
I can't quite contain or explain my evil ways
Or explain why I'm not sane

All I can say is this is your warning
Duality
Du-duality
Du-duality
I am good, I am evil
I am solace, I am chaos
I am human, and that's all I've ever wanted to be
No, can't count the list of things
I know are wrong with me
No need to just keep fighting
No, I'll never get away
I'll have it any way
I'll never stop
I can't quite contain or explain my evil ways
Or explain why I'm not sane
All I can say is this is your warning
I can't quite contain or explain my evil ways
Or explain why I'm not sane
All I can say is this is your warning
