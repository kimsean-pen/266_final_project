Mandy used to be that girl
The one that never said a word
But she only sang
S Club 7 in all those boy bands

Now it's been a few years
It looks like things have changed
Now she's mine and I want to say

Mandy always laughs when I act stupid
I am unaware that I'm a nuisance
With her it's never wasted time

Mandy always knows exactly what I'm
Thinking and she's always on my mind
And I'm never gonna let her go
'Cause Mandy always knows

Mandy always tells the truth
Even when it's hard to do
And she always understands
Even when it don't make sense

Even though she is the blonde
I'm the one that feels so dumb

Mandy always laughs when I act stupid
I am unaware that I'm a nuisance
With her it's never wasted time

Mandy always knows exactly what I'm
Thinking and she's always on my mind
And I'm never gonna let her go
'Cause Mandy always knows

When I have a problem
I'm sure that Mandy knows
When I'm feeling lonely
I'm sure that Mandy knows

When everything's crazy
She's always there for me
And I'm sure that she knows
I'm never ever gonna let her go

Mandy always laughs when I act stupid
I am unaware that I'm a nuisance
With her it's never wasted time

And Mandy always knows exactly what I'm
Thinking and she's always on my mind
And I'm never gonna let her go
'Cause Mandy always knows

Mandy always laughs when I act stupid
I am unaware that I'm a nuisance
With her it's never wasted time

Mandy always knows exactly what I'm
Thinking and she's always on my mind
And I'm never gonna let her go
'Cause Mandy always

Never gonna let her go
'Cause Mandy always knows
