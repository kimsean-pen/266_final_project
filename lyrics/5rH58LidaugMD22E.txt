Your pretending fooled us all
Optimistic delusional
Hyperactive and so it shows
It's time to measure the immeasurable

Our indifference grows
From the common evil known

The future's laid out beautiful
Designs suggesting hints to God
I'd like to fathom the unfathomable
And swear to find that certain pressure point

Our indifference grows
Like the common evil known
Held down by words
