Rollin', Rollin', Rollin',
Rollin', Rollin', Rollin',
Rollin', Rollin', Rollin',
Rollin', Rollin', Rollin',
Rawhide!

Keep Rollin', Rollin', Rollin',
Though the streams are swollen,
Keep them dawwgies rollin', Rawhide!
Through rain and wind and weather,
Hell bent for leather,
Wishing my gal was by my side,
All the things I'm missin'
Good vittles, love and kissin',
Are waiting at the end of my ride.

Move 'em on, head 'em up, head 'em up, move 'em on.Move 'em on, head 'em up, Rawhide.Cut 'em out, ride 'em in, ride 'em im, cut 'em out, cut 'im out, Ride' em in, Rawhide!

Keep movin', movin', movin',
Though they're disapproving,
Keep them dawwgies movin', Rawhide!
Don't try to understand them,
Just rope, throw and brand 'em,
Soon we'll be living high and wide!
My heart's calculating,
My true love will be waiting,
Be waiting at the end of my ride.

Move 'em on, head 'em up, head 'em up, move 'em on.Move 'em on, head 'em up, Rawhide.Cut 'em out, ride 'em in, ride 'em im, cut 'em out, cut 'im out, Ride' em in, Rawhide!
