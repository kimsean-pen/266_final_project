Topanga's hot tonight, the city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
The rumbling from distant shores sends me to sleep, but
The facts of life can sometimes make it hard to dream

Life rocked me like Mötley
Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you wear

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about heroin
How it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane
Destined for a foreign land
I hoped that you'd come back again
And tell me everything's okay, ay
Babe, yeah

Topanga's hot today, Manson's in the air
And all my friends have gone, 'cause they still feel him here
I want to leave, I'll probably stay another year
It's hard to leave when absolutely nothin's clear

Life rocked me like Mötley
Bad beginnin' to my new year
Life rocked me ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you hear

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about heroin
And how it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on the aeroplane
Destined for a foreign land
I thought that you'd come back again
To tell me everything's okay, babe
Babe, yeah

(It's fucking hot, hot!) Winter in the city
Something 'bout this weather made these kids go crazy
(It's hot!) Even for February
Something 'bout this sun has made these kids get scary
Ohh! Writing in blood on my walls and shit
Like, ah, oh my God
Jumping off from the walls into the docks and shit
Oh, ho-ho-ho! I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it
Baby, (Baby) come on, (Come on) come on (Come on)

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about marzipan
Taking all my medicine to take my thoughts away
I'm getting on that aeroplane
Leaving my old man again
I hope that I come back one day
To tell you that I really changed
Baby

(It's hot, hot!) Something 'bout the city
Don't know what it is, it makes my head get crazy
Ohh! Makes me feel like I can change
Oh, ho-ho-ho! All of my evil ways and shit
Mmm, mmm
Ohh, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it
