I hear the bells, I hear the wind
I hear a song, in my heart again
And the tenderness moves all things
Like a poltergeist in the streets

It's a silly rush that i used to get
Singing billy or reading Vonnegut
I could teleport to the stars
Kinda strange that im all alone

Cause you really hold me down like that
Cause you really know whats down like that
Like the universe is singing a song
Do you feel it when you write like that
Do you feel it cause you're down like that
Like the universe is singing a song

Cause you really hold me down like that
Cause you really know whats down like that
Like the universe is singing a song
Do you feel it when you write like that
Do you feel it cause your down like that
Like the universe is singing a song

Its just a story though
Is it story though
I cant tell if it happened cause it felt impossible
Don't know whether it was real or a dream
Imagination playing tricks on me
Now tell me what you know is this a story or
An allegory for the racket knocking at my door
Whats the difference if its real or a dream
Imagination playing tricks on me

Whats the difference in my love or scheme
The difference in what you say what you mean
What you mean you don't really know
I'm losing touch with the physical
I'm showing up in the future like I've been here before
Ain't that a story though
Like you don't even know
Somebody switching the digits up on my casio
Don't know whether this is real or a dream
Imagination playing tricks on me
