Slapped my face,
Slammed the door,
A dozen roses lay on the floor.
I saw her friends,
And I was told,
She blocked my number from her cell phone.
You said we,
Were meant to be,
Now this obsession is killing me.
Until I have,
A heart attack,
I'll keep on trying to win you back.

Alone at last,
I can't wait 'till we're alone at last,
All i wanted was a second chance, second chance,
To hold you in my arms at last.

Forever,
Forever,
I'll walk a thousand miles,
Just to tell her,
To tell her,
Our love is still alive,
And I'll never,
I'll never,
I'll never let it die,
Well you'd better watch your step,
She's a diamond on a landmine.

I'm not so sure,
About this word,
But she kept calling me insecure.
I tried to quit,
But theres no use,
'Cause I'm addicted to her abuse.
She's in control, of everything,
I'm just the puppet, she pulls my strings,
Denying truth, I'll test my fate,
I'll keep on playing this wicked game.

Alone at last,
I can't wait 'till we're alone at last,
All I wanted was a second chance, second chance,
To hold you in my arms at last.

Forever,
Forever,
I'll walk a thousand miles,
Just to tell her,
To tell her,
Our love is still alive,
And I'll never,
I'll never,
I'll never let it die,
Well you'd better watch your step,
She's a diamond on a landmine.
Better watch your step,
She's a diamond on a landmine.
Better watch your step,
She's a diamond on a landmine.
Waiting to explode...

Went dancing on thin ice before,
Frozen from the winter's cold,
And if it were to crack below,
I'd never let you go...

Alone at last,
I can't wait 'till we're alone at last,
All I wanted was a second chance, second chance,
To hold you in my arms at last.

Forever,
Forever,
I'll walk a thousand miles,
Just to tell her,
To tell her,
Our love is still alive,
And I'll never,
I'll never,
I'll never let it die,
Well you'd better watch your step,
She's a diamond on a landmine.
Better watch your step,
She's a diamond on a landmine.
Better watch your step,
She's a diamond on a landmine.
Waiting to explode...

You'd better watch your step,
She's a diamond on a landmine.
You'd better watch your step,
She's a diamond on a landmine.
You better not touch,
She's a diamond on a landmine.
Better to forget,
She's a diamond on a landmine.
Waiting to explode...
