I tear your heart out from behind
Remorse survives as mine
You're unaffected, still unaware
Of our damage done

The shame, it takes me
The pain, it breaks me
What have I done?
How do I atone
For all that's unknown?

I feel the ice-cold dagger
Make its way between my ribs again
I stand before disaster
Defiantly, I lie then suffocate
I'm running on empty
I'm chasing a dead dream
I'm all out of time
Clutching the will
Only to feel
No way to heal

I try to mend it, to build it back
But the wound's become a scar
You're lying face down and you're veiled in red
The sight won't leave my head

The shame, it takes me
The pain, it breaks me
What have I done?
How do I atone
For all that's unknown?

I feel the ice-cold dagger
Make its way between my ribs again
I stand before disaster
Defiantly, I lie then suffocate
I'm running on empty
I'm chasing a dead dream
I'm all out of time
Clutching the will
Only to feel
No way to heal

No way to heal

I stand before disaster
Defiantly, I lie then suffocate
I'm running on empty
I'm chasing a dead dream
I'm all out of time
Clutching the will
Only to feel
No way to heal
Running on empty
Chasing a dead dream
I'm all out of time
Clutching the will
Only to feel
There's no way to heal
