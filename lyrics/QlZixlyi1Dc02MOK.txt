Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah
Ayy

I don't like you, why you
Always tryna follow me?
I'm your king, I'm your love,
I'm your diamond piece
Take this emotion that
Just found it's way inside of me
Since a kid, I've been
Searching for the truth in me
I'm a bumble bee,
I'm a bumble bee
Follow my path and see
All that you've done to me
Said I'm a bumble bee,
I'm a bumble bee
Follow my path and see
All that you've done to me
All that you've done (Sweet)

That bitch said
She want cocaine
I don't got you and
I'm feeling so ashamed
I could take you to this
Place I call the cave in
Don't you worry, I'mma
Gget you feeling safe here
Bitch, we run this, can't
You tell by how we pressing
Moving fast, hope
You got your seat belt fastened
Fall in love, I swear
We moving to Nebraska
Specializing on my life
Like it's your master, ayy

I'm fucked up, you fucked up
We so lust, don't fuck up
'Cause I hate you and you hate me
Take my life, don't chase me, ayy

I don't like you, why you
Always tryna follow me?
I'm your king, I'm your love,
I'm your diamond piece
Take this emotion that just
Found it's way inside of me
Since a kid, I've been
Searching for the truth in me
I'm a bumble bee,
I'm a bumble bee
Follow my path and see
All that you've done to me
Said I'm a bumble bee,
I'm a bumble bee
Follow my path and see
All that you've done to me
All that you've done (Sweet)
