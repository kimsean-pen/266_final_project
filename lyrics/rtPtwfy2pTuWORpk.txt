dreamer
everytime you stargaze
the whole world
is lying at your feet

well your prayers will be heard
the moment you start believing

think twice
just before you begin
'cause it's easy
to loose yourself in onward motion

well your prayers will be heard
the moment you start believing
well your prayers will be heard
angels'll come to sing
the moment you start believing

cherish
every single day
when fortune
is showing you the way

well your prayers will be heard
angels'll come to sing
a song you never heard
here's a new beginning
the moment you start believing
you'll get a new beginning
the moment you start believing
you'll get a new beginning
