Caught in this fort of disgrace for a god's oppression
This corridors behold disease
As I am feeding my guts with the flesh of the race of abomination
I collect the souls I bury beneath
Forever tied by the arms of the desolation,
A stain for the sovereign of greed
And I was born like a prince, wickedly raised in devastation
I dishonoured the descent with my seed

Kill the king!

For all the treason he concealed in deceit

Gods, kill for me
Bless my pain
For the monstrosity I had to feel

Gods, kill the king!

Cast in shadow,
Forgotten, lost forever,
Eternal slave,
Prince of darkness
I rule on nothing

Hail!

Asterion, Lord of Suffering

Torn by the lust for control he betrayed Poseidon
The reckoning arises from the sea,
For it's the land of the pain,
Falling from the guilt of the despotic Minos,
Cursed shall be the name for the rest of days.
Blood from the womb of the queen
Pouring like a rainfall,
A stain for the land of the king
The ghastly sperm of the beast fecundates like an infection
I, dishonoured, the abominated beast

Kill the king!

For all the treason he concealed in deceit

Gods, kill for me
Bless my pain
For the monstrosity I had to feel

Gods, kill the king!

Cast in shadow,
Forgotten, lost forever,
Eternal slave,
Prince of darkness
I rule on nothing

Hail!

Asterion, Lord of Suffering
