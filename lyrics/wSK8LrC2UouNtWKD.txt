Lover, I know you're weary
Eyes are tired from the night

Lover come to the kitchen floor
Tiles are cold, so am I

So take from me what you want
What you need
Take from me whatever you want
Whatever you need
But lover, please stay with me

Lover, I feel your sorrow
Pouring out of your skin
I don't wanna be alone
If I am tonight
I'll always be

So take from me what you want
What you need
Take from me whatever you want
Whatever you need
But lover, please stay with me, oh

And I can see you
I can feel you slipping through my hands
Oh, and I can taste you
I can taste you slipping through my hands
So, take from me what you want
What you need
Take from me whatever you want
Whatever you need
My lover, please stay with me
Oh, my lover, please stay with me
