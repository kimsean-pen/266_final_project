You beat my drum, drum, drum, and it's dynamite
You beat my drum, drum, drum, and it feels so right
I'm like a bomb, bomb, bomb, ready to explode
Yeah, I'm on fire, on fire

Tonight you're gonna save my world
Baby it's there tonight
You're gonna light my world

I'm getting high on your love
I'm getting high on your love
I'm getting high on your love
I'm getting high on your love

(I'm getting high on your love!)
(High on your love!)

You'll take me high, high, high, like a paper kite
Up in the sky, sky, sky, on a starry flight
I'm like a bomb, bomb, bomb, ready to explode
Yeah, I'm on fire, on fire

Tonight you're gonna save my world
Baby it's there tonight
You're gonna light my world

I'm getting high on your love!
I'm getting high on your love!
I'm getting high on your love!
I'm getting high on your love!

(I'm getting high on your love!)
(I'm getting high on your love!)
(High on your love!)

I'm high on your love
You make me fly on love
You make me cry, you make me sigh
You make me die for love
I'm high on your love
You make me fly on love
You make me cry, you make me sigh
You make me die for love

All of my days I dream of you
All of my nights I get high on you
Giving me wings, that's what you do
Boy you make my dreams come true

Tonight you're gonna save my world

I'm getting high on your love!
I'm getting high on your love!
I'm getting high on your love!
I'm getting high on your love!

(Getting so high on your love!)
(Getting so high on your love!)
(I'm getting high on your love!)
(High on your love!)
