To love somebody naturally
To love somebody faithfully
To love somebody equally
Is not enough, it's not enough
It's not enough

To love somebody secretly
(And never touch)
To love somebody honestly
(And always trust)
To love somebody tenderly
The tender touch is not enough
It's not enough

Love hurts you sometimes
It's not so easy to find, no
Searchin' everywhere, you turn and swear (Ahh-ahh-ahh)
It's always been there

To love somebody foolishly
(Can happen once)
To love somebody hopelessly
(It hurts so much)
To love somebody equally
Is not enough, it's not enough
It's not enough

Love takes a little time
It's not so easy to find
Searchin' everywhere, you turn and swear
It's always been there

Standin' there

Oh

And if it don't come easily
One thing you must believe
You can always have trust in me
'Cause my heart will always be, yours honestly

Yeah! Love hurts you sometimes
Not so easy to find
Searchin' everywhere, you turn and swear
It's always been there, standin' there
Love hurts you sometimes
It's not yours, it's not mine
Love is only to share
You turn and swear (Ahh-ahh-ahh) it's everywhere
Standin' there (Ahh-ahh)
'Cause it's always been there
