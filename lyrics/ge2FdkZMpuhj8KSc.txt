It's too late to save today
It starts inside my head
Let it course into my bones
I breathe recycled air
Just to feel like I'm not alone
So does it kill you now?
(Call it insincere)
You took the worst way out
(And I'm still here)

It's too late, it's too late
The ground's breaking under me
I can't breathe, I'm underneath
So go ahead and wish me hell
Cause you're the one who dragged me there, yeah
It's too late to save today

I took the right one at the wrong time
It's like a dry scrape that you know can never heal
So give me something I can feel
(I can feel)

So let it kill me now
I took the worst way out
(And I'm still here)

It's too late, it's too late
The ground's breaking under me
I can't breathe, I'm underneath
So go ahead and wish me hell
Cause you're the one who dragged me there, yeah
It's too late to save today

And I still feel her in my bones
Feel her in my bones
I'm not alone

It's too late, it's too late
The ground's breaking under me
I can't breathe, I'm underneath
So go ahead and wish me hell
Cause you're the one who dragged me there, yeah
It's too late to save today
