I tightened my grip
Around my bow
I'll try to save you all
Knuckles turning white
Blood runs cold
There's a boy with no face

I don't feel there's much separation
I'm an animal
Hope leaves when the waves come crashing

I've never been a religious man
But I'm slipping under drowning
In your eyes
I've never been a religious man
But I'm slipping under drowning
In your

Footprints in the snow
The sun runs off
The gloom begins to grow
The bleak reaches these bones
Rushing through
There's a boy with no face

I don't feel there's much separation
I'm an animal
Hope leaves when the waves come crashing

I've never been a religious man
But I'm slipping under drowning
In your eyes
I've never been a religious man
But I'm slipping under drowning
In your

I left you the forest
Let the spirit go
Rid this place of monsters
I left you the forest
Let the spirit go
Rid this place of monsters

I've never been a religious man
But I'm slipping under drowning
In your eyes
I've never been a religious man
But I'm slipping under drowning
In your
I'm slipping under drowning
But I'm slipping under drowning
