There's a sheet upon the sky
Kinda mixes my soul
On the king's highway
I didn't know where to go

If you're ever feeling lost
Never thought I was
Can the king fall again?
I sure would love him to sing

Under a white sky
White sky
White sky
White sky, coming down on me

Was it something in the road
I tried to loosen my load
When I came to watch the sun
I tried to walk across the road

If you're ever feeling lost
Never thought I was
Can the king fall again?
I sure would love him to sing

Under a white sky
White sky
White sky
White sky, coming down on me

Coming down on me
Coming down on me
Coming down on me
Coming down on me

Coming down on me
Coming down on me
Coming down on me
(Coming down on me)
Coming down on me

Under a white sky
(Coming down on me)
White sky
(Coming down on me)
White sky
(Coming down on me)
White sky, coming down on me

Under a white sky
White sky
White sky
White sky, coming down on me
