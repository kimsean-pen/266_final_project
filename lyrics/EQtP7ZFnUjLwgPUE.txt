We all live in unforgiving precarious ways
If it bleeds it leads
Is all we seem to hear today
Thorns remain while flowers fade

Monster
Such a noble novelty
Monster
Such a proper prodigy
Monster
It is all enrolled in you and me

Either wasteland or wonderland
Look at what we've done
Take a step back
Shake your head at what we have become
We're the glory and the scum

Monster
Sewer of uncertainty
Monster
Creator of entropy
Monster
It is all enrolled in you and me

Monster
Polluter of dignity
Monster
Glory and the scum are we
Monster
Oh the best and worst is all in me
