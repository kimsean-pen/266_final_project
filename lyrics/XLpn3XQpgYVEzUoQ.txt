My buddies tell me, that I should have waited
They say I'm missin' a whole world of fun
But I still love them and I sing with pride
I like the Christian life

I won't lose a friend, by heading God's call
For what is a friend, who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasure in things I despise
I like the Christian life

My buddies shun me, since I turned to Jesus
They say I'm missin' a whole world of fun
I live without them and walk in the light
I like the Christian life

I won't lose a friend, by heeding God's call
For what is a friend, who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasure in things I despise

I like the Christian life
I like the Christian life
