Sticker this, censor this, ban this
We've got something to say
Police this, condemn this, damn this
We'll be heard anyway

Middle finger is the flag that I wave when I'm
Silenced
Listen here
Is it a possibility?

That we are all just equal
Slam the power down
Abusing
Does it piss you off to be beat at your own game?

You lead us with false morals and shelter reality
No more... We're not buying your product when
Your selling
The words preaching silence

Insult me in my home
When you were never invited
To live life on your curve
Frustrating

Throw sticks into the spokes
To relieve insecurities
Stifle all ascension and sticker our freedom of speech!
Sticker this, censor this, ban this

We've got something to say
Police this, condemn this, damn this
We'll be heard anyway
Middle finger is the flag that I wave when I'm

Silenced
Silenced
Don't tell me what I want
Don't tell me what I need

Don't tell me how I need to feel
I feel, goddamn nothing
Dig the eyes out of my face and I can still see right
Fuckin' through you

Fuck you and everything you are
I'm me, we're us and thats all
Closed mind with a forum to criticize
Keep your policy and I've got mine

Exploit me, fabricate your lies
We empower these cowards just to be left in
Silence
Listen here

Stand on my soapbox
And speak my own peace
Whatever you may think
It's real

Prevail through what is me
And step on your beliefs
Thieving spineless sellouts
Robbing our integrity

Bring it on!
Sticker this, censor this, ban this

Police this, condemn this, damn this
We'll be heard anyway
Middle finger is the flag that I wave when I'm...
