Eleanor, put those boots back on
Kick the heels into the Brooklyn dirt

I know it isn't dignified to run
But if you run, you can run
To the Coney Island roller coaster
Ride to the highest point
And leap across the filthy water
Leap until the Gulf Stream's brought you down
Oh oh ohhhhh
I could be there when you land
I could be there when you land

So, Eleanor, take a greenpoint three-point Turn towards the hidden sun
You know you are so elegant when you run
And, if you run, you can run

To that statue with the dictionary
Climb to her fingernail and
Leap yeah take an atmospheric
Leap and let the jet stream set you down

I could be there when you land
I could be there when you land
Could be there when you land

So, Eleanor, put those boots back on

Put the boots back on and run and run

Oh come on over here
Oh come on over here
Oh come on over here
