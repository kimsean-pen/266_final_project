I looked into her eyes and I swore
I've never written a cliche before
And I'll probably never do so
She was beautiful though

I think it's time for me and you to take over the world
I think it's time for me and you to take over the world

I'm only a paperboy from the North West
But I can scrub up well in my Sunday best
How could I ever do for you?
Because I'm true and I'm real and this is how I feel

I think it's time for me and you to take over the world
I think it's time for me and you to take over the world

A glossy magazine on the coffee table
And you've held court with half of the culprits in
there who seem unstable
But you don't look at them like you do at me

Those eyes are only mine, what a wonderful time
When your eyes are mine, and mine are yours
I turn over in bed and you're not there

Nowhere to be seen
All I can do is flip the Mac and gently touch the screen

I think it's time for me and you to take over the world
I think it's time for me and you to take over the world

Take over the world
Take over the world
