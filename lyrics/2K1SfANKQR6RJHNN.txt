Hey boy
You got a good conversation
you got a real smooth line
but you're not penetrating
somebody else has got my time

We're running up a
blind alley blind alley
blind alley blind alley
I forgot who I was

My love told me you were coming
said you would try and break us up
so let me tell you something
your talk ain't good enough

We're running up a
blind alley blind alley
blind alley blind alley
I forgot who I was

What you want is temporary
but what I got is gonna last
one day we're gonna marry
so quit your talking so fast

We're running up a
blind alley blind alley
blind alley blind alley
