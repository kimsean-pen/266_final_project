Off work in the morning
Up at the crack of dawn
All my money worries
Wherever I go come along

Worrys a bully
That just won't let me be
Trying to keep me busy
Tussling and struggling

No home since the fire
Me and the ashtray can't settle down
I'm sure of where I'm bound
So I sink another round

Placebo for pain
And there's no one for to blame
I refuse to accept
That my work is all in vain

Worrys a bully
That just won't let me be
Trying to keep me busy
Tussling and struggling

Still always remembering
When the going gets tuff
That the labor of our love
Will reward us soon enough

Still always remembering
When the going gets tuff
That the labor of our love
Will reward us soon enough

Man's never alone
If he can offer help
Always thinking of
Everyone else before himself

Worrys a bully
That just won't let me be
Trying to keep me busy
Tussling and struggling

No home since the fire
Me and the ashtray can't settle down
I'm sure of where I'm bound
So I sink another round

Placebo for pain
And there's no one for to blame
I refuse to accept
That my work is all in vain

Worrys a bully
That just won't let me be
Trying to keep me busy
Tussling and struggling

Still always remembering
When the going gets tuff
That the labor of our love
Will reward us soon enough

Still always remembering
When the going gets tuff
That the labor of our love
Will reward us soon enough
