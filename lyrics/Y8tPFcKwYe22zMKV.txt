Watch your tongue or have it cut from your head
Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid
Children roam the streets now orphans of war
Bodies hanging in the streets to adore
Royal flames will carve a path in chaos
Bringing daylight to the night
Death is riding into town with armor
They've come to take all your rights
Hail to the king. Hail to the one
Kneel to the crown. Stand in the sun
Hail to the king
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
The king
Blood is spilt while holding keys to the throne
Born again but it's too late to atone
No mercy from the edge of the blade
Dare escape and learn the price to be paid
Let the water flow with shades of red now
Arrows black out all the light
Death is riding into town with armor
They've come to grant you your rights
Hail to the king. Hail to the one
Kneel to the crown. Stand in the sun
Hail to the king
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
The king
There's a taste of fear
When the henchmen call
Iron fist to tame the land
Iron fist to claim it all
Hail to the king
Hail to the one
Kneel to the crown
Stand in the sun
Hail to the king. Hail to the one
Kneel to the crown. Stand in the sun
Hail to the king
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
