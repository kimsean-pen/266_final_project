Everyone dies, but not everyone truly lives.
Everyone dies, but the faithful will live on to rule the Kingdom.

Destiny comes for the ones unsatisfied with a life lived in the shadows;
generations past that will last in the history of the eternal Kingdom.
You'll hear their names, and see their faces.
Their story goes on, 'cause death can't intimidate or restrain the army of the Lord.

I will live forever, because I stand on the rock of ages.
I will live forever, because the Lord has never faded.
I will live forever, between the end and the beginning.
I will live for the fame of the Holy King, the immortal One.

Each generation has claimed that there is power in His name
to heal the broken, and set the captives free.
Each generation has claimed that there is power in His name
to heal the broken, and set the captives free.

From age to age, this story will never die.
So we proclaim a Kingdom with the power to heal the world.
There is one King, one name, and one God, and He's made us Immortal,
as the carriers of light for the everlasting One.

He came with heaven's dream to awaken dead men (dead men...)

We will retell this story with every breath in our lungs.
We will proclaim His glory with every breath in our lungs.

Everyone dies, but not everyone truly lives.
Everyone dies, but the faithful will live on...
