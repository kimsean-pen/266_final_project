Shh, quiet, you might piss somebody off
Like me, motherfucker, you've been at it for too long
While you feed off others' insecurities
You stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
Lies inside your head, your best friend
Heart bleeds but not for fellow men
Broken glass, your fake reflection

I've had enough it's time for something real
Don't respect the words you're speaking gone too far
A clone

So how does it feel to know
That someone's kid in the heart of America
Has blood on their hands, fighting to defend your rights
So you can maintain a lifestyle that insults his family's existence
Well, where I'm from
We have a special salute, we aim high in the air
Towards all those pompous assholes
Who spend their days pointing fingers, fuck you

Shh, quiet, you might piss somebody off
Like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
I'll be damned if you count me in as part of your
Generous hypocrisy collecting enemies

Tabloid gossip queen, worthless man
There's no need for us to bury you
Selfish agenda once again
Right this way, you've dug your own grave

I've had enough it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking gone too far
A clone

All the way from the east to the west
We got this high society looking down on their very foundation
Constantly reminding us
That our actions are the cause of all their problems
Pointing their fingers in every direction
Blaming their own nation for who wins the elections
They've never contributed a fucking
Thing to the country they love to criticize

Excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue
Depictions we see try and get through
Admitting mistakes can hurt
I'm not the last but I sure ain't the first

Shh, quiet you might piss somebody off

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
Lies inside your head, your best friend
Heart bleeds but not for fellow men
Broken glass, your fake reflection

I've had enough it's time for something real
Don't respect the words you're speaking gone too far
A clone
