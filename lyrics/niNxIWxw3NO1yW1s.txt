Yeah my girlfriend
Takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous
When I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does

She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero's just because
(Yeah just because)
And my girlfriend
Likes U.L and D.H.C,

And she's so smart and independent
I don't think she needs me

Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another
Guy that she'd prefer
And when I feel like giving up

Like my world is falling down
I show up at 3 a.m.
She's still up watching vacation
And I see her pretty face
It takes me away to a better place and
I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything

Everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything

Everything's gonna be fine
Yeah my girlfriend

Takes collect calls from the road
And it doesn't seem to matter
That I'm lacking in the buldge
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does

She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero's just because
And when I feel like giving up
Like my world is falling down
I show up at 3 am
She's still up watching vacation
And I see her pretty face
It takes me away to a better place and
I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine
