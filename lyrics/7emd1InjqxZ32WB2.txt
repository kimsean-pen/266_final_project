Was in the way you put your coffee down
There was something on your chest
The days keep dragging on and on
I got a bag of old regrets

You said the whole shebang
The crumbly bits
Aw babe I want much more than this
Okay, será
Será, será, será

Don't go, don't go
Don't go making something out of nothing
Don't go
What do you think it would change?

In a dream you saw a memory
Held a sign that said confess
Nostalgia she's a shit disease
It's a shame to reminisce

I want hippie love
Future sex
5am French cigarettes
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, será, será

Don't go, don't go
Don't go making something out of nothing
Don't go
What do you think it would change?

Maybe I'm not enough
It's all coming around again
Maybe I'm not enough

Don't go making something out of nothing
Don't go making something out of nothing
What do you think
What do you think it would change?
Don't go
(Don't go making something out of nothing)
Don't go
(Don't go making something out of nothing)
What do you think
What do you think it would change?
Don't go
Don't go
Don't go
