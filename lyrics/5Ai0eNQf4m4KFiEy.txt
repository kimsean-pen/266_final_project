In my darkest hour
A place where there's no light
I'm trapped here in this nightmare
And there's no end in sight
My body lies here bruisen
No voice to scream or shout
Escaping feels untouchable
I know I must get out
Wake my...
Wake myself from all this danger
Claw my...
Claw myself from six feet under
No, no, no
Am I stuck here like a prisoner of war
I will breathe once more
I will breathe once more
These feeling's overwhelming
It just won't go away
I'm captive in this nightmare
And this is where I'll stay
Wake my...
Wake myself from all this danger
Claw my...
Claw myself from six feet under
No, no, no
Am I stuck here like a prisoner of war
I will breathe once more
I will breathe once more
My anxiety is rising
It just won't go away
Why does this issue keeps building?
You just leave me to die
Make, make, make it go away
All I wanna do is live another day
Make, make, make it go away
All I wanna do is live another day
Wake my...
Wake myself from all this danger
Claw my...
Claw myself from six feet under
No, no, no
Am I stuck here like a prisoner of war
I will breathe once more
I will breathe once more
