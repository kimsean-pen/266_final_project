It's time we should talk about it
There's no secrets kept in here
Forgive me for asking
Now wipe away your tears

And if i wish to stop it all
And if i wish to comfort the fall
It's just wishful thinking

I sat on the roof
And watched the day go by
I see the likeness in his smile and the way he stands
It makes it all worthwhile

And if i wish to stop it all
And if i wish to comfort the fall
It's just wishful thinking

It's time we should talk about it
There's no secrets kept in here
I see the likeness in his smile and the way he stands
It makes it all worthwhile

And if i wish to stop it all
And if i wish to comfort the fall
And if i wish to stop it all
And if i wish to comfort the fall
It's just wishful thinking
