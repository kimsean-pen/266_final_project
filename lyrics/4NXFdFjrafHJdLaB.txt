Conquers shining on the ground,
The air is cooler
And i feel like i just started uni
Walking backwards to my van
Your at your window,
And im tripping every time i think of

Lying in your attic
I can feel the static
The storm has broken, Heavens open

Send my body out to work
But leave my senses
In orbit over south east London
Wind the window down and pinch
Me on the shoulder
Whilst il be off to dream of

Lying in your attic
I can feel the static
The storm has broken, Heavens open
So electrifying, Oh im nearly flying
Lost my heart between the sheets of lightening

I've been singing you this song,
Inside a bubble,
Been Zorbing through the streets of Cowley,
We were always meant to be,
Zorbing together, And i think its high time we started

Lying in your attic
I can feel the static
The storm is breaking, windows shaking
So electrifying, Oh im nearly flying
Lost my heart between the sheets of lightening

Lying in your attic
I can feel the static
The storm has broken, Heavens open
So electrifying, Oh im nearly flying
Lost my heart between the sheets of lightening
