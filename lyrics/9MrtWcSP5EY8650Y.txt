I feel your naked skin and my adrenaline is pumpin'
We start to move cause everybody on the floor is jumpin'
The chemistry is right we use the energy for flyin'
Don't need to care about tomorrow livin' like we're dyin'

I'm gonna lose it tonight
I'm gonna freak out and shout
Not gonna be anything but loud

Electric, I'm electric, so electric
I'm about to blow
Electric, I'm electric, so electric
System overload
When I'm under the light I feel free something's taking control over me
Electric, I'm electric, so electric
I'm about to blow

Let your body be my engine don't stop what you're doing
Use the power of the music let me see you movin'
Get me into shock we're on our way to break the ceiling
Keep it up and let the beat just hit you with that feelin'

I'm gonna lose it tonight
I'm gonna freak out and shout
Not gonna be anything but loud

Electric, I'm electric, so electric
I'm about to blow
Electric, I'm electric, so electric
System overload
When I'm under the light I feel free something's taking control over me
Electric, I'm electric, so electric
I'm about to blow

I wanna please you
I wanna tease you
I wanna feel you
I wanna breathe you
I wanna eat you
I wanna rock your body
I wanna lead you
I wanna squeeze you
Wanna release you
Baby the night is young so let's start a fire

Electric, I'm electric, so electric
I'm about to blow
Electric, I'm electric, so electric
System overload
When I'm under the light I feel free something's taking control over me
Electric, I'm electric, so electric
I'm about to blow
