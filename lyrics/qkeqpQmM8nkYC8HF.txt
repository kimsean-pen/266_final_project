"Hey you're a riddle" I say as I move aside
Like I really need your advice
And don't leave it alone
Little men try, don't get a lot done
Living in sin doesn't move me either way
I get a feeling you're so vague, well like I said before
And little men come when anything goes

When the rain comes I sit home and I pray
Make it all numb I wish it all away
All I really need is just somewhere to hide away
(Kick him when he's down)
Here alone I'll put up and fight
(Kick him when he's down)
Beat me all the way I'll take it all night
(Kick him when he's down)
Hey don't worry I'll get along home alright

Hey everybody's supposed to be the same
So how come on they're so lame, it's like taking a fall
They keep on running back into that wall
Awake in a dream get up and go to work
A-but I'm feeling like such a jerk, well like I said before
Little men come when everything goes

When the rain comes I sit home and I pray
Make it all numb I wish it all away
All I really need is just somewhere to hide away
(Kick him when he's down)
Here alone I'll put up and fight
(Kick him when he's down)
Beat me all the way I'll take it all night
(Kick him when he's down)
Hey don't worry I'll get along home alright, so right

So woah, "Hey you're a riddle" I say as I move aside
Well like I really need your advice
You won't leave it alone
Little men try, don't get a lot done
Living in sin doesn't move me either way
I get a feeling you're so vague, well like I said before
Little men come when anything goes

When the rain comes I sit home and I pray
Make it all numb I wish it all away
All I really need is just somewhere to hide away
(Kick him when he's down)
Here alone I'll put up and fight
(Kick him when he's down)
Beat me all the way I'll take it all night
(Kick him when he's down)
Hey don't worry I'll get along home alright

(So believe it)
Here alone I'll put up and fight
(So believe it)
Beat me all the way I'll take it all night
(Believe it)
Hey don't worry I'll get along home alright
(So right, so right, so right, so right, so right)
