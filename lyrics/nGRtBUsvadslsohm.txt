Cold winter months, and I'm thinking of you
How you're not with me
I used to choreograph
The animals in the sea

Did you take the rhythm from me?
Yesterday I had it all
Did you take the rhythm from me?
Yesterday I had it all

Some day, you're gonna take me back
Some day, you're gonna take me back
Today, I had a heart attack
Some day, you're gonna take me back

Cold winter months, and I'm thinking of you
How you got me high
I used to choreograph
The aeroplanes in the sky

Did you take the rhythm from me?
Yesterday I had it all
Did you take the rhythm from me?
Yesterday I had it all

Some day, you're gonna take me back
Some day, you're gonna take me back
Today, I had a heart attack
Some day, you're gonna take me back, back, back

I've got a choice now, I've got a voice now
I've got a choice now, I've got a voice now
I've got a choice now, I've got a voice now
I've got a choice now, I've got a voice now

Cold winter months, and I'm thinking of you
How you're not with me
Cold winter months, and I'm thinking of you
How you're not with me

Cold winter months, and I'm thinking of you
How you're not with me
Cold winter months, and I'm thinking of you
How you're not with me

Cold winter months, and I'm thinking of you
(Did you take the rhythm from me?)
How you're not with me
(Yesterday I had it all)

Cold winter months, and I'm thinking of you
(Did you take the rhythm from me?)
How you're not with me
(Yesterday I had it all)

Cold winter months, and I'm thinking of you
(Did you take the rhythm from me?)
How you're not with me
(Yesterday I had it all)

Cold winter months, and I'm thinking of you
(Did you take the rhythm from me?)
