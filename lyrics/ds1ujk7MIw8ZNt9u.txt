Fed-up
Tired
Sick and twisted
One-man army
I'm enlisted
Trust yourself trust no one else
Fuck a hero be yourself
I don't need your lousy hand-out
Clinched fists I'll fight my way out
Fighting my way out
Find my way out

People wake up and sing along
I trust no one
My trust is gone
Born with nothing
(Born with nothing)
Die with everything
Born with nothing
(Born with nothing)
Die with everything
Yeah

In a daze
These days go by
Faster and faster I speed through life
Now I've got to take control
Of my mental and my physical
Never sheltered from life's hard storms
I was cold but now I am warm
Inside I'm warm
(now I am warm)

People wake up and sing along
I trust no one
My trust is gone
Born with nothing
(Born with nothing)
Die with everything
Born with nothing
(Born with nothing)
Die with everything
Yeah

Searching and finding the truth inside myself
Searching and finding the truth inside myself
Inside myself

(Searching)
(Finding)
(Truth)

Fed-up
Tired
Sick and twisted
One-man army
I'm enlisted
Trust yourself trust no one else
Fuck a hero be yourself
I don't need your lousy hand-out
Clinched fists I'll fight my way out
Fighting my way out
Find my way out

Born with nothing and die with everything
Born with nothing and die with everything
Born with nothing and die with everything
Born with nothing and die with everything

My soul was starving
I was born with nothing
(Born with nothing)
I'll die with everything.
Yeah

Born with nothing and die with everything
Born with nothing and die with everything
Born with nothing and die with everything
Born with nothing and die with everything.
