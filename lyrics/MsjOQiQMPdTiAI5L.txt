She haunts the roads
She waits for a new face
The arms red and injured
She wants to rise
She can't till we have faced
I'll cut your armies down
And turn your heart

You wait, I'll wait
I'll lie awake for you

I'll cut your armies down
And turn your heart

You wait, I'll wait
I'll fly away
I'll break
Down
Down

She haunts the road
She waits for a new face,
Face
