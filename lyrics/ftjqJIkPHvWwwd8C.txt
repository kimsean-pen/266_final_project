Hit me with your best shot
Give me all that you've got
Hit me till I'm down and out
And black and blue
Now for the love of God
Hit me with your best shot

It was the last thing on my mind
Well could it be, could it be
At the wrong place, the right time
Bittersweet surrender
I let the face of concrete meet with mine

Way to kick me when I'm on the ground
Way to kick me when I'm already down
When you thought that I would turn around
I turned the other cheek

Hit me with your best shot
Give me all that you've got
Hit me till I'm down and out
And black and blue
Now for the love of God
Hit me with your best shot

You made my peaceful bubble burst
Well you don't just leave me
Destroy me first
Bittersweet surrender
I let you mark the spot

Hit me with your best shot
Give me all that you've got
Hit me till I'm down and out
And black and blue
Now for the love of God

Hit me with your best shot
Give me all that you've got
Hit me till I'm down and out
And black and blue
Now for the love of God
Hit me with your best shot

We are falling to pieces
One by one, going down
Will you pick up the pieces
Or leave them scattered on the ground
This will be your final chance
To fight for what we've got

Hit me with your best shot
Give me all that you've got
Hit me till I'm down and out
And black and blue
Now for the love of God

Hit me with your best shot
Give me all that you've got
Hit me till I'm down and out
And black and blue
Now for the love of God
Hit me with your best shot
