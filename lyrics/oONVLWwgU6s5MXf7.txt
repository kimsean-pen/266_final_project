I don't need anybody but me
I don't want anybody but you
All this faith and still I don't believe
I don't need anybody but me

Come on get up get off your knees
We'll bring down the machine

All my sisters, all my brothers
Burning in the sun
When we fight we die together
We are the children of the gun
Children of the gun

I can't see anyone before me
You can't see anyone before you
All this faith and still I don't believe
I can't see anyone before me

Come on get up get off your knees
We'll bring down the machine

All my sisters, all my brothers
Burning in the sun
When we fight we die together
We are the children of the gun
Children of the gun

Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger
Don't shoot me...

Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger
Don't shoot me...

Come on get up get off your knees
We'll bring down the machine

All my sisters, all my brothers
Burning in the sun
When we fight we die together
We are the children...

All my sisters, all my brothers
Burning in the sun
When we fight we die together
We are the children of the gun
Children of the gun
