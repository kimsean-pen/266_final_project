Please, don't hate me mama
For what I'm about to do
But the good times we've had together
Are just about now through

Please don't misunderstand me
I hate to see you cry
But I think that it might look better
If I told you now, goodbye

I'm back on the road again
It's time I leave you now
And maybe I'll see you
Next time, I'm around

Until then I hope you're happy, baby
And good times come your way
I'm back on the road again
I'm on my way, yeah, yeah

Well, I've loved you since the day I met you
And I'll love you til the day I die
But we both know the life I'm livin'
And we both know the reason why

That I've got to leave ya, mama
And I've got to leave today
But you know that I'll see you
Next time, that I come
Through your town to play

Back on the road again
It's time I leave you now
Maybe I'll see you
Next time, I'm around

Until then I hope you're happy, baby
Good times come your way
Back on the road again
I'm on my way, yeah, yeah

I'm back on the road again
It's time I leave you now
And maybe I'll see you
Next time, I'm around

Until then I hope you're happy, baby
Good times come your way
I'm back on the road again
I'm on my way

I'm back on the road again
I'm on my way, yeah, yeah
I'm on my way, yeah, yeah
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye, baby

Back on the road again, back on the road again
Back on the road again, I'm back on the road again
Back on the road again, back on the road again
