Now it's 20 years later somewhere far across the ocean
Here I am, chillin' with the homies on some grown shit
Thank god that I made it this far
If it wasn't for my driver then I would've crashed the car
It's the beach boy comin' through the city goin' hard
I got big money callin' Im just tryna play it smart
Play it smart, I'm just tryna play it smart
Play it's smart, I'm just tryna play it smart

I got rich hoes with me and they don't know who you are
They say, "Yung Pinch why you such a goddamn star?"
Poppin' bottles at the club, gettin' more drinks at the bar
These hoes showin' love, put the whole thing on they card, wait
What you mad for? I know bad hoes, on some dark shit
They get cash flow, do your own thing, see how that goes
That's what I did, yeah, that's what I did

Now it's 20 years later somewhere far across the ocean
Thank god that I made it this far
If it wasn't for my driver then I would've crashed the car
It's the beach boy comin' through the city goin' hard
I got big money callin' Im just tryna play it smart
Play it smart, I'm just tryna play it smart
Play it's smart, I'm just tryna play it smart

Used to be the homie, now we on our own shit
Don't know who you are now
Switched up who you rode with
Don't act like you know me, don't act like you know shit
Don't act like we friends now, boy you on that hoe shit
Hatin' on the low shit, talkin' bullshit
Say you wanna see me win, I know you don't
Bitch, remember they ain't like me
Now they act just like me, ran off with my old steeze
Tryna dress just like me, I see all that fuck shit
Ain't shit gettin' by me, used to want to fight me
Well pussy boy come try me
I'm with all that fuck shit, actin' like you tough shit
New homies really with the shits and they gon' bust quick
No I am not tough bitch, I care about my safety
No you can't replace me, hell no you can't replace me
'Cause I want this forever, yeah forever
I got all these bands in my hands might change the weather
Wish it would get better, I just need a freight
Slide it back homeboy you know I'm gon' be safe
Look at where I'm at now, this shit feel like fate
Look at where I'm at now, you can't pass the gate

Now it's 20 years later somewhere far across the ocean
Here I am, chillin' with the homies on some grown shit
Thank god that I made it this far
If it wasn't for my driver then I would've crashed the car

I got big money callin' Im just tryna play it smart
Play it smart, I'm just tryna play it smart
Play it's smart, I'm just tryna play it smart
