I got sunburn waiting for the jets to land
Circus people with hairy little hands
Can it boys and strike up the army band
I got sunburn waiting for the jets
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
I can't seem to see through solid marble eyes
Fiery pianos wash up on a foggy coast
Squeaky old organs have given up the ghost
Fire them up and kill the piano birds
There's creaky old organs burning on the coast
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
I can't seem to breathe with rusted metal heart
I can't seem to see through solid marble eyes
