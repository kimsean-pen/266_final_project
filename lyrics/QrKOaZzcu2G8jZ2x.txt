Baby, can I talk to you?
I know something's wrong
Things just ain't the same
But deep down inside
I know you still care
So tell me what to do
To get things back?
The way they used to be

If you were to need me
If you really cared about me
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart?
If you were my lover
A constant friend to me
Tell me why would you turn away from my love?

So darlin'
Tell me what to do to make things right?
Darlin'
Tell me what to do to make things right?
Darlin'
Tell me what to do to make things right?
(For love)
Tell me what to do to make things right for love?
(For love)

If you want a reason
When they won't turn away from me
They're tryin' hard to hide all truth they might say, yeah
If you listen to me, girl
If you know how I'm feelin' inside
Then maybe you wouldn't shut me out your life, Baby

So darlin'
Tell me what to do to make things right?
Darlin'
Tell me what to do to make things right?
Darlin'

All I'm askin' for
Is a chance to let me love you
(Can't you see?)
Girl, you know with me
Is where you should be
And if by chance we should find
That it can be for you and I
Then girl, I'll try

There's so many ways to love
So just open your heart
And I'll find the way

All I'm askin' for
Is a chance to let me love you
