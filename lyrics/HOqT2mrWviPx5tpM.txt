Holding the reigns of the lives you've freed
You have come so far so they won't hang
In your stunning composition
The complexity of light
Will call on you to dance in its fire

Now you're in the whole world's view
Counting the crow's feet
I won't bind The Order's reach
I cannot dare

Menacing disguise in your head
Leads you toward the truth
But they won't care

If we leave it soaring
We hide beneath the eyes of fear
To find a reason to believe

Now you're in the whole world's view
Counting the crow's feet
I won't bind The Order's reach
I cannot bear

In these seventeen hours I'll be alone
In your black I'll meditate
I won't find out your name
Before it's too late

In the point between fear and laughter
You'll find me waiting
Tore down to the bone
With a guiltless cost
Your frightened eyes will find hope
Hiding in your...

Sleep now, dreams will always go away
But are you afraid the sound of my eyes will keep you awake?

In this strange set of days
We will learn what we now deserve
With our strange set of ways
We'll burn

It's been seven years, rising up
The eye's glow never shined so vividly
It's the mask that makes us weak
The hand that never feeds

And we've always known.
