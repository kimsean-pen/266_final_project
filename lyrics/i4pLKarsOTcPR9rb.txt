Ohh Ohh ohh
Ohhhh ohh ohh
Slow motion when you walk
My heart screams lights camera action
Wanna flip to the page in the script
When we kiss in the pouring like Spider man did with Mary Jane

You're so cinematic, your touch I got to have it
Ever scene your making me believe
It doesn't have to be on another movie screen
Red hot, none stop, we got cinematic, love cinematic love

Rated R in our secret spot, hoping we don't get busted by the cops
Heating up ready or not
I've been waiting all this time for the fairy tale to come alive

You're so cinematic, your touch I got to have it
Ever scene your making me believe
It doesn't have to be on another movie screen
Red hot none stop we got cinematic love cinematic love

Let's jump free fall into the water, let's run no one else even matters
Take me far away, disappear into the screen
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh

You're so cinematic, your touch I got to have it
Ever scene your making me believe
It doesn't have to be on another movie screen
Red hot, none stop, we got cinematic love, cinematic love

It doesn't have to be on the other movie screen.
Red hot, none stop, we got cinematic, love cinematic love
