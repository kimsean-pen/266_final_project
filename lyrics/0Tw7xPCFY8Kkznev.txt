Let me guide you to where it's silent
Cross the limit of survivors guilt
The crowds/clouds/crops are waiting, the cycles/disciples taken by the burning/probing sun
We're moving on the straight line into depths unknown

My curse is to love you
Until we see the last of us
Our chance of surrender
Nothing but eternity

My curse is to love you
Until we see the last of us
Our chance of surrender
Before we find our destiny

Let me guide you to where it's silent
Across of limits of surviver's guilt
The crowds are spending they have sweet making? for the last of gods
The fire burns as if there's no tomorrow, no tomorrow

You know, my heart will fail
You know, my back will break
And again and again
It will hurt just for you to reveal my pain

My curse is to love you
Until we see the last of us
Our chance of surrender
Nothing but eternity

My curse is to love you
Until we see the last of us
Our chance of surrender
Before we find our destiny

Black magic, unconditional love
Black magic unconditional
Black magic, unconditional lust
Black magic irresistable
