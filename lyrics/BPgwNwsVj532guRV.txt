When the world is on your shoulders
And the wind is getting colder
And you cannot seem to find your peace of mind

You start to feel like nothing matters
One more fall and you might shatter
Everyday you find a mountain you can climb

And all of these things you've been through
The dreams that you said goodbye to
You wonder where this leaves you now

As long as you keep on fighting
I swear there is a silver lining
You're gonna see the sun come out

You've gotta give it time
Gotta give it time
You're gonna be alright
You've gotta give it time
Gotta give it time
And you've got the rest of your life

With the darkness finally fading
You can start another painting
Fill the day with all the colors of your life

We show up and do our best
Never know what happens next
I hope its easier with me right by your side

As long as we keep on fighting
I swear there is a silver lining
We're gonna see the sun come out

We gotta give it time
Gotta give it time
We're gonna be alright
We gotta give it time
Gotta give it time
And we've got the rest of our life

Where your past holds you back
So you can't move on
I hope you knew that there's a new kind of you (???)

As long as you keep on fighting
I swear there is a silver lining
You're gonna see the sun come out

You've gotta give it time
Gotta give it time
You're gonna be alright
You've gotta give it time
Gotta give it time
And you've got the rest of your life

You've gotta give it time
Gotta give it time
You're gonna be alright
You've gotta give it time
Gotta give it time
And you've got the rest of your life
