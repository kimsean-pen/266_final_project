Quiet now
Still of night
Inside fire burnin' bright

Right moment
Layin' down
Oh, still no sound

It's all automatic
No thought
Automatic

Golden hair
Skin glisten
Beating heart but don't listen

Angles sharp
Crash together
Time and consciousness save her

Mind in automatic
Time stop
Automatic

Quiet now
Still of night
Inside fire burnin' bright

Quiet now
Right moment
Still of night
Layin' down
Oh, still no sound

It's all automatic
Time stop
Automatic
