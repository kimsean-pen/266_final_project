Some friends of mine, just the other night
Went to hear this cool cat blow
They said he sang so good that the roof fell in
And he didn't even stop the show

They don't remember the place,
But they remember the face,
And now everybody wanna go. Woo!

Top Jimmy cooks!
Top Jimmy swings!
He's got the look! Woo!
Top Jimmy, he's the king!

Jimmy on the television
Famous people on there with him
Jimmy on the news at five!
Jimmy on the radio and even on the video
The baddest cat alive!

Drivin' all the women crazy
All they want is Jimmy baby
Love it when he rolls his eyes!

Top Jimmy cooks!
Top Jimmy swings!
He's got the look!
Top Jimmy, Woo! Shake it baby!

(Guitar Solo)

Oh! Juke joint Jimmy is the latest thing
He's got the sound that everybody digs!
Yeah the joint be jumpin'
When the band be pumpin'
and you know they play a crazy gig!

Well, you ain't been livin'
Till you seen the livin' end
Top Jimmy and his Rhythm Pigs!

Ow, Top Jimmy cooks!
Top Jimmy swings!
He's got the look!
Top Jimmy,
Oh Jimmy
Top Jimmy
Go Jimmy
Top Jimmy
Ow! He's the king!

Oh, Jimmy!
