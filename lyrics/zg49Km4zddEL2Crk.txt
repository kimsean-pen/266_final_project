So look in my eyes, what will you leave behind once you've gone? (so precious)
You got what you came for now I think it's time to move on (went will you stay)
But these ghosts come alive like water and wine and walk through these streets
Singing songs and carrying signs
To them these streets belong

My atonement lasts the best part of eternity (eternity)
Ran out of hands to count the sin that breeds inside of me (inside of me)
Not this hate but the loneliness has left me here into this mess of

My hands are soaking in the blood of angels
On broken wings they collapse (will I see the break of day)
Dark clouds exploded and torrents of rain fell
All these lost halos wash away

Head hung from shame we bear a weight that brings me to a crawl (to a crawl)
These years of longing tell decades of unanswered calls (unanswered calls)
For a change, 'cause everyday we slip and fall
Kicked while we're down, our fists clench into ball

My hands are soaking in the blood of angels
On broken wings they collapse (Will I see the break of day)
Dark clouds exploded and torrents of rain fell
All these lost halos wash away

So look in my eyes, what will you leave behind once you've gone? (so precious)
You got what you came for now I think it's time to move on (went will you stay)
But these ghosts come alive like water and wine and walk through these streets
Singing songs and carrying signs
To them these streets belong
