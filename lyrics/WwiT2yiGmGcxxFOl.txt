Theres a whisper
I would like to breathe
Into your ear
But I'm too scared
To get that close
To you right now

There are dreams
We might have shared
And I still care
And I still love you
But you know how Ive been untrue

In the beginning
We closed our eyes
Whenever we kissed
We were surprised
To find so much inside
