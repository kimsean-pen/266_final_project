It's time to make the Christmas punch
Let's hang the streamers from the ceiling
Bring out the old cheer, ring in the New Year
And get that Christmas feeling

I wish you joy that never ends, happy times with all your friends
Come on and hold my hips a little longer, as we do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga

The old white tree still looks good
And grandma's angels got me thinking
String up the new lights, brighten the cold nights
And get those baubles blinking

I wish you joy that never ends, happy times with all your friends
Come on and hold my hips a little longer, as we do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga

I'd like to take this opportunity to wish you all
A very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
And by the way, have a nice life

Then we'll put on party hats
As the year comes to a conclusion
Turn on the yule log, spike up the egg nog
And break those resolutions

I wish you joy that never ends, happy times with all your friends
Come on and hold my hips a little longer, as we do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga

I wish you joy that never ends, happy times with all your friends
Come on and hold my hips a little longer, as we do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga
