Let go
All I wanna do tonight, ooh

The day's been long, I just got home
And work is driving me crazy
I could do up, I could go out
But I'm feeling too lazy

I wanna run, I wanna have fun
But I don't wanna work it
All I wanna do is go and kick it with my crew tonight
(All I wanna do tonight)

All I wanna do is let go tonight
I'm feeling right, just wanna forget about it
All I wanna do is let go tonight
Wind it up without my getup
All I wanna do is get down tonight
Move around tonight, don't really care about it
All I wanna do is let go tonight
I'm feeling free tonight it's just for me

I count on you, you're coming too
Yeah, I'm hoping you feel it
Cause at my best and at my worst
Yeah, you've already seen it
Let down your hair, the hell who cares
Gonna let it all out
All I wanna do is go and kick it with my crew tonight
(All I wanna do tonight)

All I wanna do is let go tonight
I'm feeling right, just wanna forget about it
All I wanna do is let go tonight
Wind it up without my getup
All I wanna do is get down tonight
Move around tonight, don't really care about it
All I wanna do is let go tonight
I'm feeling free tonight it's just for me

High heels just feels
Like a business stance, make it hard to dance
Tight shirt, short skirt
Just hurt, too much work

A fake up of make up
Never handled the wet, cause I wanna sweat
All I wanna do is go and kick it with my crew tonight

All I wanna do is let go tonight
I'm feeling right, just wanna forget about it
All I wanna do is let go tonight
Wind it up without my getup
All I wanna do is get down tonight
Move around tonight, don't really care about it
All I wanna do is go and kick it with my crew tonight

All I wanna do is let go tonight
I'm feeling right, just wanna forget about it
All I wanna do is let go tonight
Wind it up, without my getup
All I wanna do is get down tonight
Move around tonight, don't really care about it
All I wanna do is let go tonight
I'm feeling free tonight it's just for me
