You're not listening
and all my words are lost and found
We both want something new
I'll take the sky, you keep the ground
We can bend, we can brake
We can learn to give and take
Do you have the friends to start a war
What could you shoot or burn
Give me a chance to live and learn
There's still so much left to explore

We were moving so fast for so long
Never taking any hints from no one
And you got running on the reign
Still running from the place where the sun dies
Take a track to the city where our hearts lay
And though our journey's still the same
Just strangers on a train

Close your restless eyes
I've seen them one to far too much
And it's hard to sympathize
When it's not me who's losing touch
Is there a joke you need to make
Is there a smile you need to fake
And you cut so deep you hit the bone
Is there a flame you need to light
Is there a nip and it's a bite
What does it take to guide you home?

We were moving so fast for so long
Never taking any hints from no one
And you got running on the reign
Still running from the place where the sun dies
Take a track to the city where our hearts lay
And though our journey's still the same
Just strangers on a train

If you got love, hold it high
Hold your heart up in the sky
Let it shine, let it shine
If you got love, sing it loud
Hold your heart up in the crowd
Let it shine, let it shine
If you got love, set it free
Hold your heart in front of me
Let it shine, let it shine
If you got love, hold it high
Hold your heart up in the sky
Let it shine, let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine
(If you got love, set it free, hold your heart in front of me)
Let it shine
(If you got love, hold it high, hold your heart up in the sky)
