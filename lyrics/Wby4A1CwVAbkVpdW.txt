Only you
Only you can make it better
Only you
Make it right
Make it right and make it better
Only you

I'm gone tonight without
Without you
I need you to make me right
Baby, only you

Only you
Only you can make it better
Only you
Make it right
Make it right and make it better
Only you

One more night without, without you
I need you to make me right

Not a night without
Without you
I need you to make me right
Baby, only you
