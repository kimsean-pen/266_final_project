The time is now or never to fit the missing piece
To take this song together, you make me feel complete
We fall into the future and through the looking glass
The light shines over our heads and so it comes to pass

To go beyond the surface, to reach into your soul
This love is not demanding, my heart has told me so
I'll hold on to my hero with faith enough to fly
The power to imagine will keep this love alive

Let's make the headlines loud and true
I wanna tell the world I'm giving it all to you
Let's make the headlines loud and clear
The best things suddenly happen when you are here

If I lost my way you'd carry me home
Take me all the way to heaven, never leave me alone
And it's just like everything matters when you are near

And it feels so good, every bell's gonna ring
Your love is alive and it's making me sing
I could fly, wanna cry, want the whole world to know
We are together, come on, baby, let? s go

And words yet to be spoken will fall upon the page
Spelling out true devotion, is all we need to say

Let's make the headlines loud and true
I wanna tell the world I'm giving it all to you
Let's make the headlines loud and clear
The best things suddenly happen when you are near

If I lost my way you'd carry me home
Take me all the way to heaven, never leave me alone
And it's just like everything matters when you are near

Let's make the headlines true this time
There's no hiding from this magical state of mind

If I lost my way you'd carry me home
Take me all the way to heaven, never leave me alone
And it's just like everything matters when you are near

Let's make the headlines loud and true
Let's make the headlines? cause I'm giving it all
Yeah, I'm giving it all to you
