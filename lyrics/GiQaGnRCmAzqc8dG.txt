Bom bom bom
Bom bom bom
Bom bom bom bom bom

Win or lose, sink or swim
One thing is certain, we'll never give in
Side by side, hand in hand
We all stand together

Bom bom bom - by-i-yah
Bom bom bom - by-i-yah

Play the game, fight the fight
But what's the point on a beautiful night?
Arm in arm, hand in hand
We all stand together

Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Keeping us warm in the night
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Walk in the light, you'll get it right

Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow
Bom bom bom bom bom

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Keeping us warm in the night
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba bom bom)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Walk in the light, you'll get it right

Win or lose, sink or swim
One thing is certain, we'll never give in
Arm in arm, hand in hand
We all stand together
Bam

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

We all stand together
