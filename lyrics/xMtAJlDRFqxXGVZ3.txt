Baby I Love You And I'll Never Let You Go
But If I Have To, Boy I Think That You Should Know
All The Love We Made Could Never Be Erased
And I Promise You That You Will Never Be Replaced

Baby I Love You And I'll Never Let You Go
But If I Have To, Boy I Think That You Should Know
All The Love We Made Could Never Be Erased
And I Promise You That You Will Never Be Replaced

I Love You, Yes I Do(Yes I Do)
I'll Be With You As Long As You Want Me To
Until, The End, Of Time
From The Day I Met You, I Knew We'd Be Together
And Now I Know I Want To Be With You Forever
I Want To Marry You
And I Wanna Have Your Kids
They Can Never Compare To The Feeling Of Your Kisses

I Can Say I'm Truly Happy To This Day
You Made Me Thank God That I Live My Life Everyday
There's Never Been A Doubt In My Mind
That I Regret Ever Having You By My Side
But If The Day Comes That I Have To Let You Go
I Think There's Something That I Should Probably Let You Should Know
I Enjoyed Everyday That I Spent With You
And I Will Miss You Cause I'm Happy That I Had You At All

Baby I Love You And I'll Never Let You Go
But If I Have To, Boy I Think That You Should Know
All The Love We Made Could Never Be Erased
And I Promise You That You Will Never Be Replaced

Baby I Love You And I'll Never Let You Go
But If I Have To, Boy I Think That You Should Know
All The Love We Made Could Never Be Erased
And I Promise You That You Will Never Be Replaced

Baby I Love You Yes I Do
I Will Be With You As Long As You Want Me To
Until The End Of Time
