I've got a big house
I've got fast car
I believe i am free
I am a good citizen
Proud of my children
I love my wife
I love my life

But something isn't sitting right
Something wakes me up at night
The background noise
The background noise
Something isn't sitting right
Something wakes me up at night
The background noise
The background noise

My goverment respects me
My gun is my security
My wealth accounts
My loyalty counts
I abide by society
I give to charity
I turn to faith
When i cannot explain

But something isn't sitting right
Something wakes me up at night
The Backgorund noise
The Background noise
Something not sitting right
Something wakes me up at night
The Background noise
The Background noise

Something isn't sitting right
Something wakes me up at night
The Background noise
The Background noise.
