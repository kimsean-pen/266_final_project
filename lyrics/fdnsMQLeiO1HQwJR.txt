Tell me that you know another way
To get it done, it's for me
Or how I would be
But it's a different situation, a different situation

You lay awake in the night
Just staring at the ceiling above
Pulling pieces of it out
Is such a waste of time

Keep on fighting to remember
That nothing is lost in the end

When you burn, burn, burn, your life down

Get me to the door, out of bed
On the track I'm not sure
Starting over
It? s a different situation, a different situation

You wake up in the night
And refuse to be afraid of it now
Unfolding pieces of it faster
Don't you waste your time

You've been planning to remember this
So nothing will be lost in the end

When you burn, burn, burn your life down
When you burn, burn, burn your life down

I travel around the block
And I'm not looking to my right
I feel the glass against my cheek
And I can't see you in the light

I break my heart around this
Break my heart around this

I travel around the block
And I'm not looking to my right
I feel the glass against my cheek
And I can't see you in the light

I break my heart around this
Break my heart around this pole
