Walking through the traffic on a Monday
In the town I grew up
Shelter from the rain in every doorway
It's dark and everyone's numb
Kids are making faces in the bus lane
But nobody looks up
Everyone's life the same as yesterday
Just like the ticking of clocks

And I'm craving, craving, craving something I can feel
Where do I go, what do I need, is it ecstasy or is it fear?
Am I on my own, am I even close?
'Coz I'm craving, still craving something I can feel
Never thought the night could get so lonely
'til she called me up

Never thought these streets could've out-grown me
I guess it wasn't enough
So I put my faith in everyone around me
Then she sold all my stuff
Sheer and wild abandon that's all I need
And someone I can trust
'Coz I'm craving, craving, craving something I can feel
Where do I go, what do I need, is it ecstasy or is it fear?

Am I on my own, am I even close?
'Coz I'm craving, still craving something I can feel
Take me far from streets and roads
Lead me out in the night
Don't show me the way back home
'Coz I

Yes I'm craving, craving, craving something I can feel
(oh) Where do I go, what do I need, is it ecstasy or is it fear?
Am I on my own, am I even close?
'Coz I'm craving, still craving something I can feel.
Oh Craving something I can feeel.
Oh craving something I can feel.
Craving
I'm craving something I can feeeel.
