This land is your land
This land is my land
From California to the New York island
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Straight waters
This land was made for you and me

As I was walking that river north highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me
I've roamed and rambled
I've followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land
This land is my land
From California to the New York island
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Straight waters
This land was made for you and me
This land was made for you and me
