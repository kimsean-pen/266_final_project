Don't you know, you gotta travel like a stole it?
Its up to you, yeah, yeah you gotta own it
No-one else is ever gonna control it
C'mon, c'mon, drive it like you stole it

It ain't easy, to get ahead
This pack you're in
Is gonna leave you for dead
So you're underground
Till you found
You signed a major deal
So you're a sell-out now

Free your mind of expectations
You do you and keep them guessing
Or you'll be another cog in the machine
Lock your screens!
Don't believe!

But the kids are cool
Yeah they're so cool
The kids are cool
Yeah, they're so cool
Yeah, they're so cool

And I don't know
How you do it
But you threw colours 'round
Like they worked like you intended
You look up
And I look down
You're on this brand new platform
I've never found

Because you free your mind of expectations
You do you and keep them guessing
Or you'll be another cog in the machine
Lock your screens!
Don't believe!

But the kids are cool
Yeah they're so cool
The kids are cool
Yeah they're so cool

Don't you know, you gotta travel like a stole it?
Its up to you, yeah, yeah, you gotta own it
No-one else is ever gonna control it
C'mon, c'mon, drive it like you stole it
Don't you know, you gotta travel like a stole it?
Its up to you, yeah, yeah you gotta own it
No-one else is ever gonna control it
C'mon, c'mon, drive it like you stole it

Free your mind of expectations
You do you and keep them guessing
Or you'll be another cog in the machine
Lock your screens!
Don't believe!

But the kids are cool
Yeah they're so cool
The kids are cool
Yeah they're so cool
Yeah, they're so cool
(Lock the screens, don't believe)
And the kids are cool
Yeah they're so cool
And the kids are cool
Yeah they're so cool
Yeah, they're so cool
