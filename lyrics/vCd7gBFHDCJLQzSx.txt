Carried your burdens in my heart
Sidelined your shallow ways
It just tore me apart
I used to think I was your savior
I see through you now
You indulge in this behavior

I don't want to know you
I don't think we should talk anymore
I want the best for you
But you're happy being miserable
I don't want to know you
Or someone who's so focused on themselves
I'll save my best for someone else

We can debate our separate views
Just look at all your roadblocks
Logic will show you truth
I've hid in shadows, wrestled demons
But I won't deny it because I know how to defeat them

I don't want to know you
I don't think we should talk anymore
I want the best for you
But you're happy being miserable
I don't want to know you
Or someone who's so focused on themselves
I'll save my best for someone else

When you throw me under the bus
Back it up and run me over
If I always catch your fall
You will never hit the surface to feel it all
You gotta feel it all

I don't want to know you
I don't think we should talk anymore
I want the best for you
But you're happy being miserable
I don't want to know you
Or someone who's so focused on themselves
I'll save my best for someone else
I'll save my best for someone else
(I don't want to know you, I don't want to know you)
I'll save my best for someone else
(I don't want to know you, I don't want to know you)
I don't want to know you
Or someone who's so focused on themselves
I'll save my best for someone else
