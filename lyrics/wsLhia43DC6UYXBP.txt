I know it isn't right, ah yeah
faith has been broken
and if I have to wait I will
I will be waiting

'cos I watched as the rain come down
and I held it in the palm of my hand
some things will never change
it's just a matter of time

oh I, I believe
I will find you there
someday
and I will follow
whereever you lead
where the river meets the sea

there's got to be a way, ah yeah
faith is still breathing
in another place, another time
I will be waiting

'cos I watched as the rain come down
and it's just a matter of time

oh, I believe
I will find you there
someday
castaway... just out of reach
driven by the storm
somewhere, I believe
you'll always find me here
and I, I will follow
whereever you lead
where the river meets the sea

if you catch yourself some morning
staring at some distant land
with the wind along the shoreline
disappearing into sand
fighting back against the tide and
slowing, sinking, losing ground,
'cos you've found yourself some answers
but you still don't understand

oh I, I believe
I will find you there
someday
castaway... just out of reach
driven by the storm
somewhere, I believe
you'll always find me here
and I, I will follow
whereever you lead
where the river meets the sea
