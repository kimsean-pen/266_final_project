Feel like someone else
Take a quaalude now
Make your throat contract
Take a quaalude now

Come on and join the crowd
It's time to have some fun
You know it's pointless when you think

Throw up on the floor
Take a quaalude now
Pass out on the street
Take a quaalude now

You can't feel anything
So why not hurt yourself?
You know I wouldn't steer you wrong
Okay, now do your worst
Yeah, yeah, believe in me
You know it pays to go along

That little pill you got
It makes you happier
It makes the whole world be your friend
Go on and swallow it
Now you feel free at last
'Cause that's what wonders wanna dance

Swallow broken glass
Take a quaalude now
Set yourself on fire
Take a quaalude now
Take a quaalude now
Take a quaalude now
Take a quaalude now
Take a quaalude now.

(End).
