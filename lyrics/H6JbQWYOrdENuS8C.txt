Arm yourselves brothers and sisters,
Arm yourselves with love
Stand up straight, walk tall and proud,
Transcend and then rise above

Arm yourselves brothers and sisters,
Arm yourselves with faith
'Cause they already walk among us,
And they say it's far too late

Arm yourselves brothers and sisters,
Arm yourselves with love
Stand up straight, walk tall and proud,
Transcend and then rise above

You better
Arm yourself, Arm yourself, Arm yourself
Some say you better
Arm yourself, Arm yourself,
Arm yourself, Some say you better
Some say you better

Calm yourselves brothers and sisters,
Stay calm but stay awake
Wash away them thoughts of doubt,
Of fear, despair and hate

Arm yourselves brothers and sisters,
Embrace them one by one
A call went out to incite you all
Make a stand and then we have won

You better
Arm yourself, Arm yourself, Arm yourself
Some say you better
Arm yourself, Arm yourself,
Arm yourself with love
Some say you better, Some say you better
Some say you better
Arm yourself with love

Go on and arm yourself
