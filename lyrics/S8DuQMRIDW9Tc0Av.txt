Do what I want 'cause I can and if I don't,
Because I wanna
Be ignored by the stiff and the bored,
Because I'm gonna
Spit and retrieve 'cause I give and receive,
Because I wanna
Gonna get through your head,
What the mystery man said,
Because I'm gonna

Hate to say I told you so, all right!
Come on!
Do believe I told you so

Now it's all out and you know
'Cause I wanted to!

Turn my back on the rot that's been
Planning the plot, because I'm gonna
No need for me to wait, because I wanna
No need 2, 3, too late, because I'm gonna

Hate to say I told you so, all right!
Come on!
Do believe I told you so

(Bass solo)

Do what I please, gonna spread the disease,
Because I wanna
Gonna call all the shots for the no's and the not's,
Because I wanna
Yeeaahhh!!
Ask me once I'll answer twice
'Cause what I know I'll tell,
Because I wanna
Sound advice and lots of ice,
I'll spell my name out loud,
Because I wanna
Oh, yeah!.
