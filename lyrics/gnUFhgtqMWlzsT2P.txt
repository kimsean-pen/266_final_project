Never mind all the riddles, we're all sick the same
Bled dry and beaten but still quick to blame
All the marks, all the nicks on all the ragged excuses

Never mind all the railing, they'll all get their own
Shot down and plundered, shipped out and sold
For all the marks, all the nicks by all the pessimistic tricks

We are here and time is relevant to mainline every worthy element.

Never mind all the riddles, we're all sick the same
Bled dry and beaten for there ain't no shame
In taking hits, cuts or nicks as long as there's no excuses

We are here and time is relevant to mainline every worthy element

Or are we emptiness?
Are we dead to this?
When will it all end?
May we cure the catalyst?
Are we emptiness?
Are we dead to this?

We are here and time is relevant to mainline every worthy element now
