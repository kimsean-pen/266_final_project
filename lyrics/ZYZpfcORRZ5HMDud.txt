you know the black dog makes the shade
he comes running from my mother
I can't watch the wake
I can't watch the wake

run north, find midnight day
that dog gonna find me
and when he does
he'll ride in my place
and when he does
he'll ride in my place

I'm gonna catch you at the gate
and let the dog bite me
I can't hold his weight
now he'll ride in my place
