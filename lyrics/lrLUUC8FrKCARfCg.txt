Lonely drive
Sights get dimmer
Spellbound all
I take thee out

My love is winter
My love is lost

Silent flow
Of passing river
From the cold
The drawls did fly

My love is winter
My love is lost

Should've been cool
Should've been cold
Could've found God
If I'd been told
That I was the other.

My love is lost

Should've been cool
Should've been cold
Could've found God
If I'd been told
That I was the other.

My love is lost.

My love is no other
My love is lost

Secret hole in my mirror
Were you told there is no real (or reel?)

My love is winter now
My love is winter's song
My love is winter now
My love is winter's song
