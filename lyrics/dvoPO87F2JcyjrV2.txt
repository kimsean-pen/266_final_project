Leave me alone, and there'll be
No one to get hurt
Nobody move and there'll be
Nothin' to disturb
The sum of it all is that you
Don't know where to turn
Despite all your promises you
Don't keep what you learn

Beautiful beat get me out of this mess
Beautiful beat lift me up from distress

Sometimes all i want is another
Drink or another pill
If i could get anything done
Maybe I'd hold still
I'm trying to levitate I'm
Trying to leave the ground
Tryin' to remember when i could
Fix anything with sound

Beautiful beat get me out of this mess
Beautiful beat lift me up from distress

I believe our love can save me
Have to believe that it can
I want to redirect myself with you
Do you understand?

Beautiful beat, get me out of this mess
Beautiful beat, lift me up from distress

(Beautiful beat get me out of this mess
Beautiful beat lift me up from distress)

I believe our love can save me
Have to believe that it can
I gotta reinvent myself for you
Can i be your man?

Beautiful beat, get me out of this mess
Beautiful beat, lift me up from distress
