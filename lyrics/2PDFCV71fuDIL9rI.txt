If this is redemption
Why do I bother at all?
There's nothing to mention
And nothing has changed

So I'd rather be working for something than
Praying for the rain
So I wander on
'Til someone else is saved

I moved to the coast
Under a mountain
Swam in the ocean
Slept on my own

At dawn I would watch the sun
Cut ribbons through the bay
I'd remember all
The things my mother wrote

That we don't eat until your father's at the table
And we don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
And never once has any man I've met been
Able to love

So if I were you, I'd
Have a little trust
2, 000 years I've
Been in that water

2, 000 years
Sunk like a stone
Desperately reaching for nets that the

Fishermen have thrown
I'm tryin' to find
A little bit of hope
Me, I was holding

All of my secrets soft & hid
Pages were folded
Then there was nothing at all
So if in the future, I might
Need myself a savior
I'll remember what was written on that wall
That we don't eat until your father's at the table
And we don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
And never once has any man I've met been
Able to love
So if I were you, I'd
Have a little trust
Am I an honest man and true?
Have I been good to you at all?
Oh, I'm so tired of playing these games
We'd just be running down
The same old lines
The same old stories
Of breathless trains and
Worn-down glories
Houses burning
Worlds that turn on their own
So, we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
And never once has any man I've met been
Able to love
So if I were you, my friend
Learn to have just a
Little bit of trust
