I read your veins like lines on a map
But I got no destination
See the smoke and signals rise from my breath
And the flames are cold and patient
I filled you with a wonderland born of my imagination
And go, I can't
'Cause my demons tied me down
With silk chains wrapped around my soul
It seems so obvious that I should put an end to this
But demons take control
Like dark sins in my soul
I know it seems so obvious that I should put an end to this
Oh, no, they're just demons
I'm pushing through the blood in you
To heal where you've been hurting
And I'm so numb, I don't feel it run
When it stains the walls around me
I filled the room with shades of you
Drawn in my imagination
And go, I can't
'Cause my demons tied me down
With silk chains wrapped around my soul
It seems so obvious that I should put an end to this
But demons take control
Like dark sins in my soul
I know it seems so obvious that I should put an end to this
Oh, no, they're just demons
They're just demons
They're just demons
They're just demons
Staring up the road
Sick of the darkness and the cold
The chains are wearing thin
Oh, I'm fighting for us both
I built this wonderland
Drenched in the colours of your skin
And go, I can't
'Cause my demons tied me down
But silk chains are broken now
It seems so obvious that I should put an end to this
But demons take control
Like dark sins in my soul
I know it seems so obvious that I should put an end to this
Oh, no, they're just demons
They're just demons
