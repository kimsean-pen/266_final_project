you say I'm not afraid but I linger.
the pleasures still the same.
she gets sicker.

I'll break your heart, if I can't stay
it's more than I might be safe to play.

It's hidden in the clouds where I can see
how easily my mind could just break free

Arise sweet demon and have your say

I deserve nothing, but fortunes way
arise sweet demon and have your say
I'll break your heart, but I can't stay

Tenderly my garden grows there.
Carefully, I'll care and wait there.
I can't be sure this round will solve it.
