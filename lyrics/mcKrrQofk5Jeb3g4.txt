Would you walk
To the edge of the ocean
Just to fill my jar with sand?
Just in case I get the notion
To let it run through my hand

Let it run through my hand, well

I don't want the whole world
The sun, the moon
And all their light

I just want to be the only girl
You love all your
Life
You love all your
Life

Would you catch
A couple thousand fireflies
Yeah,
Put them in a lamp to light my world

All dressed up in a tux and bowtie
Hand deliver to a lonely girl (Lonely, lonely girl)
To a lonely, lonely girl

Well, I don't want the whole world

The sun, the moon
And all their light
I just want to be the only girl
You love all your
Life
You love all your
life

Lately I've been writing
Desperate love songs
I mostly sing them
To the wall
You could be the center piece of
My obsession
If you would notice me, I
Ohh yeah

Well I don't want
The whole world, no
The sun, the moon
And all their light
I just want to be
The, oh, only girl
You love all your
Life
You love all your
Life
You love all your
Life
Life
Yeah
