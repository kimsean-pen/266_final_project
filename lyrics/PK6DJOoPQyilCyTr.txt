In the morning when they found us
And we woke up in the coconut wind
How you took my hand and told me
All the stories of the places you'd been

And how you thought that I would make it
Now you were the one for me, yeah

How can you really love someone who can't love you
How can you love someone you can't leave
It's my fault, it's your fault too
How 'bout you go and find somebody who can love you

When I wake up in the morning
How long until you roll in my dreams
But how I learned not to care
If you're not the story that's easily seized
And how can you treat me so badly
If you love me don't treat me so mean
Cause I'm... darlin', politely asking
Can't you see all the pain that I'm in

It's gettin' pretty hard to make it
That's all the time for me, and for you

How can you really love someone who can't love you
How can you love someone you can't leave
It's my fault, it's your fault too
How 'bout you go and find somebody who can love you

How can you really love someone who can't love you
How can you love someone you can't leave
It's my fault, it's your fault too
How 'bout you go and find somebody who can love you

How can you really love someone who can't love you
How can you love someone you can't leave
It's my fault, it's your fault too
How 'bout you go and find somebody who can love you

How can you really love someone who can't love you
How can you love someone you can't leave
It's my fault, it's your fault too
How 'bout you go and find somebody who can love you
