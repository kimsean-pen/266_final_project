Sunday she walks
Now she's gone
And what do I know
She's never home
You promised her
You'd never nail her down
She's not a picture on the wall
When she needed a friend
You weren't around
So don't wait up for her call

I was in a daze
Now she's with her friends
Thought it was forever
That there'd be no end
'Cause you promised her
You'd never nail her down
She's not a picture on the wall
She needed a friend
You weren't around
So don't wait up for her call

If she wants you gone, boy
You better get out of sight, yeah
'Cause she's got the right
You say she never calls
And she stays out all night, yeah
Well she's got the right
If she wants to move
You better sit tight, yeah
'Cause she's got the right, yeah
If you put her down, well
She's gonna fight, yeah
'Cause she's got the right, yeah

If she wants you gone, boy
You better get out of sight, yeah
'Cause she's got the right
You say she never calls
And she stays out all night, yeah
Well she's got the right
If she wants to move
You better sit tight, yeah
'Cause she's got the right, yeah
If you put her down, well
She's gonna fight, yeah
'Cause she's got the right, yeah
