I lost myself on a cool damp night
I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree

I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be

When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine
Is sweet and heady
Like my love
Lilac wine
I feel unsteady
Like my love

Listen to me
I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she
Coming to me
Nearly here

Lilac wine
Is sweet and heady
Where's my love
Lilac wine
I feel unsteady,
Where's my love

Listen to me
Why is everything so hazy
Isn't that she
Or am I just going crazy, dear?

Lilac wine
I feel unready for my love
Feel unready
For my love
