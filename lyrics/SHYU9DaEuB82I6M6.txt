Lets call this the quiet city
where screams are felt as the waves of the stoplights
Drive through the streets
as gunshots punctuate the night
The sides we take divide us from our faith
and the mourning dove gets caught in the telephone wire

Asleep you set the fire in your own house
and the night was a knife the cut
and I'm paralyzed

Cross out the eyes, blur all the lines
Tearing this canvas from the wall
Cross out the eyes, put lines through these cries
Pulled all the leaves from the trees that fall

Yeah trees that fall, trees that fall, trees that fall, fall

A silent dance that we did into this hospital bed
hear voices from another room:
"It happens all the time"
But July in the sand then
The leaves fall and counting down our days to live
Drain the blood from this valentine:

"We can rise on the wings of the dove
See blue skies getting caught in the trail of all this smoke
We can rise, like candles in the dark -Yours always"
and an envelope marked with your new address

Asleep you set the fire in your own house
And the night was a knife that cut
And I'm paralyzed

Cross out the eyes, blur all the lines
Tearing this canvas from the wall
Cross out the eyes, put lines through these cries
Pulled all the leaves from the trees that fall

Cross out the eyes, blur all the lines, lines
Cross out the eyes, blur all the lines, cries
The eyes, cross, the eyes cross

It was the first time face to face
Crossing the line talking to the other side of death
Hearing the words that choke memories into flatlines
Calling your name, hoping for something to wash these dreams of you away

Til we die, memories and flatlines
Cross out the eyes til we set off these lines
Cross out the eyes til we set off these lines
Cross out the eyes

Our fence was blown down in a winter storm in this field
(Cross out the eyes)
Stretches out of this world into the sound
(A trace of)
What can we do the put a stop the the coming white days
(A love song)
I'm hoping for something to wash these dreams of you away

(Stretches out of this world
Lets drive back the dead
Stretches out of this world
Stretches out of this world)
