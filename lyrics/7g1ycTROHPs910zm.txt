Why do your eyes paralyze me
What makes me feel this way
Just carry me away with silence and
Heartbeats as rapid
Thinking about your embrace
And how it makes me feel
I just want to feel this way forever
Sleep on portraits painted as perfect as you
Why have I been given the chance to fly
When I'm not with you I feel lesser alone
Why have I been given the chance to fly away
I remember your face imprinted on angels
Your voice as beautiful as the sound of waves
Crashing against my heart
Time stands still when you look at me
I'm infatuated with this
Infatuated with you
I remember your face imprinted on angels
It's so hard for me to understand
Why I hadn't found you before
Don't dull away
Hold my hand
