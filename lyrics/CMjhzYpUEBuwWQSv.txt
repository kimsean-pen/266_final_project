It's already the time that you hold my mind, it's true
And I've been thinking bout' what to say or not to do
So you wanna be a man about it, do you
And have you figured out all you wanted, have you

When your heart becomes a million different pieces
That's when you won't be able to recognize this feeling

That's called tough love
That's called tough love
That's called tough love
That's called tough love

In the middle of the night all I think about is you
I trail in all your clouds of glory, it's true
So you wanna be a man about it
Do you have to
And have you figured out all you wanted, have you

When your heart becomes a million different pieces
That's when you won't be able to recognize this feeling

That's called tough love (tough love)
That's called tough love (tough love)
That's called tough love (tough love)
That's called tough love (tough love)

You have me crying out, crying out for more
You have me crying out, crying out for more
You have me crying out, crying out for more
You have me crying out, crying out for more

That's called tough love (tough love)
That's called tough love (tough love)
That's called tough love (tough love)
That's called tough love (tough love)
