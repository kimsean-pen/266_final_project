Mother, where are you today?
You took a piece of me the day you went away
No recollection nor the smell of your perfume
I took a piece of you the day I left the womb.

(the day I left the womb)
Brother, put your needles down.
The best thing for you is to leave this awful town.
Pretty soon, you'll have kids to feed.

If you see mother, tell her I can sing
Please don't worry, I am doing fine.
You're much to busy to even find the time
So use your chemicals and take this to your grave

The boys you left are men you didn't raise.
And daddy, how are you today?
You must be proud of the boys that you have raised.
Your withered heart and everything it's seen
Your guts and callouses, you had kids to feed.

You had kids to feed.
Please don't worry, I am doing fine.
You're much to busy to even find the time
So use your chemicals and take this to your grave
The boys you left are men you didn't raise.
