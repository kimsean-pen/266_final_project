I close my eyes

All my life
Been indestructible
I've never known why
Oh, tell you no lie
Indestructible
I'm never gonna die

My dignity was taken from me
And I cry, I cry
Been beaten up abroad
And been brought down to my knees
But survived, I survived

Undefeated, defeated by nothing
Undefeated, running and running
Undefeated, but still I keep coming

Indestructible
All of my life
Indestructible
All of my life

I close my eyes

Tell me I'm wrong
I'm indestructible
I'll come to no harm
Oh, tell me 'bout you
You're indestructible
But fragile, too

I've only been what I've wanted to be
What's the crime? What's the crime?
Did my best, didn't always succeed
But I've tried, I've tried

Undefeated, defeated by nothing
Undefeated, running and running
Undefeated, but still I keep coming

Indestructible
All of my life
Indestructible
All of my life

I close my eyes
In search for something sacred
I end up chasing my own shadow in the dark
And all the times
I thought I wouldn't make it
I couldn't take it
But it was always in my heart
In my heart

Indestructible
All of my life
Indestructible
All of my life
Indestructible
I don't know why

Indestructible
All of my life
Indestructible
All of my life
Indestructible
I don't know why
