I had a solemn dream
A towering door before me
Then came a voice that shook the candles
It was my mother's scream
I tried to breach the threshold
But I was too small to reach the handles
What was this vision that called me in the dead of night?
Was it a dream I had of another life
Or an echo returned from childhood?
Father could never take
The smallest show of weakness
We watched them bury her alone
And held every tear that made
Attempt to break for freedom
I crushed my pulse against her headstone
What was this vision that called me in the dead of night?
Was it a dream I had of another life
Or an echo returned from childhood?
I hold my breath, for what is this?
Fate's been jilted by a twist
A search for words to free my lips
No metaphor will fit
This matchless beauty
Her stately dress, her perfect form
The gentle raising of her arms
Her shoulder owned by brazen flocks
Of swirling raven locks
That flow like mercy
Into the driest depths in me
"Hello? I have a question, could you make suggestions?"
"Is there anybody here?" (I hear my mind tell me, "Disappear")
"I've traveled far, I have no time" (I have no time)
"This is my only chance to find such dress of yesteryear" (only chance to find her)
When will I overcome this fear?
"I came in the side, it wasn't locked"
"Is there no keeper of this shop?" (I am the keeper of this shop)
I'm waiting for my chance to breathe
"I am alone, it would appear"
"There's no one here" (I dare not let her leave me here)
Just when I thought my time had passed
Love showed charity at last
But now she's heading for the door
And I couldn't speak before
She fled and left me
Where is the courage that I need?
