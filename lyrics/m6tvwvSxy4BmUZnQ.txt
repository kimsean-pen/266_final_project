Say just right, when you are around
Take a drive, take a drive to town
Meaningfull, nothing but you
Petulia, you are in my blood again

Like a hurt undone
Like a love without a sound
Like a heartbeat
Moving through me

Says just right, life on my breath
Take it low, take a drive to town
Meaningless, everything but you
Petulia, let's make a wish

For a hurt undone
A love without a sound
Like a heartbeat
Moving through me

Like a hurt undone
Like a love without a sound
Like a heartbeat
Moving through me
