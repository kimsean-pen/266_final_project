He should not be here
He's just too big
In a cloud please come down
I'd put stars at your feet
Put mars at your head
Show yourself to me
And I'd believe
I'd moan and I'd weep
Fall silent at your speak
I'd burst in
Full to the brim

Mary lost her head
And let it bleed
Came crying back to me
My son, where's he been?
Don't deny it
And don't you hide him
No I've missed him

No words no sign
Mary say I'm not lying
How come he's so big
But good lord he's been hid
Good lord where're you hid
No I've missed him
