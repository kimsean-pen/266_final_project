Screams echo through the halls
Fingernails dragging down the walls
Broken down, betrayed, abandoned
Never thought you'd see my face again?

Behind barred windows I watch the sky
Not an hour goes by without asking why

Broken down, betrayed, abandoned
Never thought you'd see my face again?
Well, did you?

Plotting my revenge is the only thing keeping me alive
Then they administer the medicine
Straight to my heart

Listen to me, I'm not insane
Leave me be, set me free

In a place so dark that demons fear
I'm rotting away, year after year
You're on the outside, you're laughing at me
One day, you'll pay, you will see

Plotting my revenge is the only thing keeping me alive
Then they administer the medicine
Straight to my heart

Listen to me, I'm not insane
Leave me be, set me free

You made them believe
In the lies that you weave
Now everyone's an enemy
Who to believe?

They shut off the lights
Another sleepless night awaits
Dreams of retribution keep me awake
My vengence will be glorious, victorious

Plotting my revenge is the only thing keeping me alive
Then they administer the medicine
Straight to my heart

Listen to me, I'm not insane
Leave me be, set me free

You will see
