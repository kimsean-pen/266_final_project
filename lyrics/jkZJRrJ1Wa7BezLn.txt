I'm watching the surf fall
I'm wishing you near me
There's oceans between us
I'm packing my lifebelt

When I see you
I fall helplessly in love
When I see you
I drown slowly under waves of love

I'm tearing my heart out
I'll give it to you
There's mountains between us
I'm thinking of calling

When I see you
I fall helplessly in love
When I see you
I drown slowly under waves of love

I'm climbing a mountain
I'm swimming an ocean
I'm dying to see you
You're killing me slowly

When I see you
I fall helplessly in love
When I see you
I drown slowly under waves of love

I'm climbing
I'm falling
I'm swimming
I'm drowning drowning drowning
