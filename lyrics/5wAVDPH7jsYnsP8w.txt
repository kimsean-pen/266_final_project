You can sink or swim, that's what they say
You should get from there to here
Orbit the edge of a vortex
Till the background disappears

He was the first man I ever met
He filled in every space
Told me not to mumble
There was anger in his face
Those green eyes
Those green eyes
Look past me
A fool lies
Only a fool lies
There is no need
There is no need
Do you have what I want?
Do you have what I want?
His dad wore Old Spice and he wore Brut
We loved him naturally
Making grilled cheese for dinner
In an RV by the sea
Or in the desert, burning out the lights
The final moment before
He was alone for all the good times
Till we stumbled through the door
There's no prize, there's no prize
No fight to win
On his side, maybe on his side
I could've been
I could've been
Did he have what I want?
Do I know what that was?
If you see who I am
Will you be who he was?
