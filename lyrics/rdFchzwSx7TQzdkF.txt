Longing eyes turn into the sun
Low in the winter
Grey as a wolf now the wind has come
Cold as a hunter

Ride across the sky, thunder roll and lightning fly
Gone is the summer
What will keep us warm in the winter
Tales of those who died, sword in hand in times gone by
Hail to the Hammer

Narrow eyes turn against the wind
Out from the ocean
Until the day when we sail again
Life is a long pain

Ride across the sky, thunder roll and lightning fly
Gone is the summer
What will keep us warm in the winter
Tales of those who died, sword in hand in times gone by
Hail to the Hammer

To the god of thunder
The god that's protecting us all
All hail to the giant hunter
And hail to the forces of nature all

Ride across the sky, thunder roll and lightning fly
Gone is the summer
What will keep us warm in the winter
Tales of those who died, sword in hand in times gone by
Hail to the Hammer
