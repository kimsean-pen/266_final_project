There was one before
And now are many
And as the days go by
I see them multiply
I can't eat
I can't sleep
Because I know
They've been watching me

Falling down on me

There's a, blackbird
In my garden
Oh!

There was one before
And now are many
And as the days go by
I see them multiply
I can't eat
I can't sleep
Because I know
They've been watching me

Falling down on me

There's a blackbird
In my garden
Oh!
