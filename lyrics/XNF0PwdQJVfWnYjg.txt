I'll stand outside your door
Play songs on the radio
Like say anything
Like in say anything
It's an old movie
You probably don't know
But my mother showed me it years ago
So say anything
You'll be the good girl
I'll be the guy to change your mind
Meet you at 2 am
Sneak you out at night
Dududuud
I'll teach you how to drive
Your stick shift car into the night
Like say anything
Like in say anything
It's an old movie
You probably don't know
But my mother showed me it years ago
So say anything
Say anything to me
Say anything diane
Say anything to me
You'll be the good girl
I'll be the guy to change your mind
Meet you at 2 am
Sneak you out
You'll be the good girl
I'll be the guy to change your mind
Meet you at 2 am
Sneak you out at night
