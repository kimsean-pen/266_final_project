All my clothes in milk crates, I don't sleep for days
Wait until the letter's read, until my bills get paid
Ah, tell me, tell me, tell me
When's it gonna change?
Ah, tell me, tell me, tell me
When's it gonna change?

Every morning I feel more useless than before
Trying hard to see the point in anything at all
Oh, I've been trying
I've been trying really hard
Yeah, I've been trying
I've been trying really hard

Pull yourself together, pick myself apart
Nothing lasts for never, so be still my bleeding heart
Oh, I've been dreaming
Dreaming of a brand new start
Yeah, I've been dreaming
Dreaming of a brand new start

Oh, you have a great abundance of axes there to grind
Remember some people have real problems next time you whine
Oh, hang the washing
Hang the washing on the line
Yeah, hang the washing
Hang the washing on the line

Yeah, I've been trying
I've been trying really hard
Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me
When's it gonna change?
