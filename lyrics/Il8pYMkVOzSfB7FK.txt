Someone come and lift me out of here
I just wanna go to sleep
There's a whisper in my ear
Someone come and lift me out of here
I just wanna go to sleep
This is something you can be

Someone lift me out of
Safe in your arms, safe in your arms
Someone lift me out of here
Lift me off
Safe in your arms, safe in your arms
