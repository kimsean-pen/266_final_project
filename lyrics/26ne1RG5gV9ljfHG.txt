I know a place at the edge of a land
Where the grass runs out and turns into sand
I know a place where a man can stand
But a man cant walk in the sea
I know a place where a man cant go
Where a man would drown and sink below
But if you have a ship then you should know
You can come with me

Come with me on a quest!!

On my quest, a quest for ships
Sailing is how I get my fix
On my quest, a quest for boats
Im out for anything that floats
Join my quest to find a craft
A barge or barque or dinghy or raft
Join my quest, a quest for ships
And now i need my fix!

I know a place where we can sail
A place i heard of once in a tale
No gems no gold no holy grail
A place at the end of the sea
But theres a problem i can see
I have no ship that could take me
But if you have one or two or three
Then you can come with me

Come with me on a quest!!
