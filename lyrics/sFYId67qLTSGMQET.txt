Pray to God
Pray to God

It's a sign of the times, girl
Sad songs on the radio
It's a sign of the times, girl
As the leaves begin to go

But all these signs now
Showin' on my face
Provin' me wrong
Takin' its place

Pray to God
(In a way that)
That there's more that we can do, yeah
Pray to God
(Pray to God)
That there's more that we can show
More then we can do, yeah

Isn't it a wonder
As a new born baby cries
Isn't it a wonder
With the sweetness in my eyes

Isn't it a wonder
On the crossroads of my life
Isn't it a wonder
Isn't it a wonder to me
Oh, you're all

It's a way of the world when
Wrong takes hold of right
It's a way of the world
In which we've all lost sight

But isn't this world
Too simple to be true
Holdin' on
To memories of you

Pray to God
(In a way that)
That there's more that we can do, yeah
Pray to God
(Pray to God)
That there's more that we can show
More then we can do, yeah

Isn't it a wonder
(Isn't it a wonder)
As a new born baby cries
Isn't it a wonder
(Isn't it a wonder)
With the sweetness in my eyes

Isn't it a wonder
(Isn't it a wonder)
On the crossroads of my life
Isn't it a wonder)
(Isn't it a wonder)
Isn't it a wonder

That I can see a change in me
(Changing)
But I won't go back 'cause that's behind me
(All behind me)
And after all strong words are spoken
My heart will never be, never be
Never be, never be

Isn't it a wonder
(Isn't it a wonder)
As a new born baby cries
Isn't it a wonder
(Isn't it a wonder)
With the sweetness in my eyes

Isn't it a wonder
(Isn't it a wonder)
On the crossroads of my life
Isn't it a wonder
(Isn't it a wonder)
Isn't it a wonder
That I can see a change in me
(Isn't it a wonder)
But I won't go back cause that's behind me
(Isn't it a wonder)
And after all strong words are spoken
(Isn't it a wonder)
My heart will never be, never be
Never be never be
