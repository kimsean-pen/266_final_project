There's a little child
Running round this house
And he never leaves
He will never leave
And the fog comes up
From the sewers and glows
In the dark

Baby alligators
In the sewers
Grow up fast
Grow up fast
Anything you want
It can be done
How, how did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Somethings will never wash away
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
