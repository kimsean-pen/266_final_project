I used to be fearless
You used to be brave
Running through evenings
Chasing days
Now we're so restless
Waiting for trains
Going through motions
All the same
We could shake it up
I'll meet you after work
We'll drive until the darkness disappears
Pack up our regrets
And wear your yellow dress
I meant it when I said we can't stay here
What's That Line?
I wanna feel
Like the first day of my life
You wanna feel
Like there's never tomorrow just tonight
Morning light and you're still by my side
I wanna feel my heart is open my eyes are wide
My eyes are wide
My eyes are wide
Whatever it costs us
Whatever may come
I'm keeping my promise we're still young
We could shake it up
I'll meet you after work
We'll drive until the darkness disappears
Pack up our regrets
And wear your yellow dress
I meant it when I said we can't stay here
I wanna feel
Like the first day of my life
You wanna feel
Like there's never tomorrow just tonight
Morning light and you're still by my side
I wanna feel my heart is open my eyes are wide
My eyes are wide
My eyes are wide
And when we wake we'll have cleaned the slate
Only empty space, only empty space
And when we wake we'll have cleaned the slate
Only empty space, only empty space
My eyes are wide
My eyes are wide
