The silent borderland
Where words become undone
Brainwave, Treachery
A different truth to see
To keep a secret
Misinfotmation is... the key

Twenty first Century
New ways of slavery
So many prying eyes
Communication spies

Ghosts are fighting for the cause
With poisoned words
Half truths, false proofs
The trap is set to snare the wolf
The Enemy of Truth

Fight the Enemy of Truth!!
Fight the Enemy of Truth!!

Sense destroyer
Sense destroyer
Sense destroyer
Sense destroyer

Mental surgery
Social lobotomy
Confusion, delusion
We all connect and share
The perfect way for lies to spread

Fight the Enemy of Truth!!
Fight the Enemy of Truth!!
