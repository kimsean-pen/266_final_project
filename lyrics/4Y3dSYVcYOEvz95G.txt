And I stand in every corner of your heart
And I give you everything that I call love
From the heavens to the bottom of the sea

Trampolene, I can't believe
You're trampling me
You tell it to me softly,
Then you disagree

Well I stand at heavens gate
Come see me cry
Heavens gate is locked,
They will not let me by
And so I walk a little mile,
Into your dream
And tell me what is on your mind
My trampolene

Trampolene, I can't believe
You're trampling me
You tell me softly,
Then you disagree

She fills my heart
I give her none
My smile is overload
Her heart is fired and very very strong
And I cannot take her on
You're searching for a truce inside my head
Is what it seems
But I cannot forget my trampolene
