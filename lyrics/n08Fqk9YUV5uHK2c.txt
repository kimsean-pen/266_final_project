Go!

I want to tear a big hole in what is to be
To end all this infatuation with unity
I'm seeking my salvation alone again
I never needed to be one of you anyway
Don't wanna be another player losing in this game
I'm trying to impress upon you
We're not the same
My own individuality is so unique
I'm one impressive motherfucker
Now, wouldn't you say

Break apart and

Divide, divide, divide, divide
You might say that I'm the
Last man standing now
And though you'll try,
You'll never find a way
To break me
You might say that I'm sick of
Being lost in the crowd
I hear the sirens but they're
Never gonna take me

I am a little more provocative then you might be
It is your shock and then your horror on which I feed
So can you tell me what exactly does freedom mean
If I'm not free to be as twisted as I wanna be
Don't wanna be another player losing in this game
I'm trying to impress upon you
We're not the same
My psychotic mentality is so unique
I'm one aggressive motherfucker
Now, wouldn't you say

Break apart and

Divide, divide, divide, divide
You might say that I'm the
Last man standing now
And though you'll try,
You'll never find a way
To break me
You might say that I'm sick of
Being lost in the crowd
I hear the sirens but they're
Never gonna take me

They won't take me

Break, break, break, break
Break apart and divide
Break, break, break, break
Break apart and divide
Break, break, break, break
Break apart and divide divide divide
Break apart and...

Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, break apart and divide
Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, break apart and
Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, break apart and divide
Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, divide, divide
