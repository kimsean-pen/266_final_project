Lee, where have you gone?
Lee, where can you be?
Lee, come on, come on, come on
Come on back to me

I dream nothing stands for the strong man
You used to be
There's no one in this world needs me
In my dreams I dream
There's somewhere in morning
The flowers in my hair
(Come on, come on back to me)
(Come on, come on, come on back to me)
(Come on, come on, come on back to me)
(Come on back to me)
(Come on, come on, come on back to me)

Lee, how could know
Lee, how it would be?
You tried to warn them, warn me

Lee, where have you gone?
Lee, where can you be?
Lee, come on, come on, come on
Come on back to me
