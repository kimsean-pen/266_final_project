Uh!
Oh yeah!
Ah-huh!

Jump back, what's that sound?
Here she comes, full blast'n top down
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue
Model citizen, zero discipline

Don't you know she's coming home with me
You'll lose her in that turn
I'll get her!

Panama, Panama
Panama, Panama

Ain't nothin' like it, it's a shining machine
Got the feel for the wheel, keep the movin' parts clean
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue
Got an on-ramp comin' through my bedroom

Don't you know she's coming home with me
You'll lose her in that turn
I'll get her
oh!

Panama, Panama
ow!
Panama, Panama
oh-oh-oh-oh
Woo!

Yeah, we're runnin' a little bit hot tonight
I can barely see the road from the heat comin' off
know what I'm sayin'
uhh, I reach down between my legs n' ease the seat back

She's runnin', I'm flyin'
Right behind in the rearview mirror now
Got the fearin', power steerin'
Pistons poppin', ain't no stoppin' now

Panama, Panama
Panama, Panama
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Panama, Panama
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Panama!
