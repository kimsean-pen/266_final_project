Lay your body on the floor baby,
I love it when you're breathing
And I've been drinking so much more lately,
But that's just how im feeling
If you don't wanna break us up, girl Then why the fuck you seething?
See I just wanna waste a little time with ya,
But then I'm up believing
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Flood it like a tidal wave
Ooh, ooh, ooh
See I'm just tryna misbehave
I know it's hard when you know you know better
Just open up let your body talk for ya like
Ooh, ooh, ooh Flood it like a tidal wave I'm
passion dripping off the wall baby, Damn you make it easy
I'm dropping little acid on our tongues baby,
We can make it freaky
Don't you think about turning the lights out,
I want them to see this
And I say fuck the rules let em find
out, But that's just how I'm feeling
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Flood it like a tidal wave
Ooh, ooh, ooh
See I'm just tryna misbehave
I know it's hard when you know you know better
Just open up let your body talk for ya like
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Flood it like a tidal wave
Like ooh, ooh, ooh Flood it like a tidal wave
Throw another stone at the glass house
You might kick my ass if he finds out
I don't wanna share it's a damn shame I'll still play it fair,
won't drop no names Flooded like the water hit the floor running
Open up your soul and let it pour flooded
Ride that fucking wave into the shore,
ride it The beach is like the meter from the bed, slide it

Ooh, ooh, ooh Flood it like a tidal wave
Ooh, ooh, ooh See I'm just tryna misbehave
I know it's hard when you know you know better
Just open up let your body talk for ya like
Ooh, ooh, ooh Flood it like a tidal wave
Like ooh, ooh, ooh Flood it like a tidal wave
