I was holding my breath when the tightrope walker slipped into the moon glow
Saying all my children, follow me
Maybe it's time to go
You can be chrome when you're wise

You can be wise when you're blue
And baby, if I have
Then I have for you
Bribing the jury to keep me in jail, singing "Tea for the Tillerman"

And although I lie fantastically, I swore an oath on my history
It's a miracle I can see
You can be wrong when you're right
Even when you're right on cue
And if I die tonight

Then I die for you
Calling on those that call me son
Great-grandson and grandson
Great uncles, aunts, and relatives

To judge what I have done
Wanna make it right by you
Even if it's all I do
And if it's all I do

Then I do it for you
People will raise a whole lotta hell about the water in the windmill
And although I stab chaotically
It hurts no one but me

Even the darkness has arms
But they ain't got you
And baby, I have it
And I have you, too

And a light in the window to pass the night through
May be so uncertain but what can I do
Keeping it on, keeping it on
And I know I like it but what does that prove

Sometimes I worry I don't know how to love you
I bring to you with reverent hands
All the books that my love abides
The kind woman that my passion wore

Like the shoreline wears the tides
Maybe the water went dry
Keeping an eye on you
And with an eye on you
It could drown me, too

People will raise a whole lotta hell about the water in the windmill
And although I stab chaotically
I swore an oath on my history
It's a miracle I can see
Even the darkness has arms
But they ain't got you
And baby, I have it
And I have you, too
And a light in the window to pass the night through
May be so uncertain but what can I do
Keeping it on, keeping it on
And I know I like it but what does that prove
Sometimes I worry I don't know how to love you
