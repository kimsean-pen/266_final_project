Ha ha
Ya'll need to get ready to hear
The unbelieveable, indescribable
Vanessa Hudgens, Baby V
Baby, come back
Everyday I try to play another game

But my heart can't take it

I try to find another boy but all the while I can't face it (Baby, come back)
Why do I miss you so much?
I wanna stop this hurt inside
Oh baby, please give us one more try
Baby, come back
I see you out with all your friends
Laughing it up as you pretend
To have a good time (Good time)
I know 'cause I'm living the same life (Same life)
So, one of us has got to say
"We can't keep living this same way"
So, I'll be the one

Yeah, I'll say it, I'll say it, I'll say it, I'll say it again
Baby, come back to me
In my heart I still believe
We were meant to be
Together so whatever it takes (Baby, come back)
Baby, come back to me
I should've never set you free
Love baby, come back (Baby, come back)

I wanna call, but then I stall 'cause after all, I just couldn't take it
'Cause if your play was to push me away
You know that day, my heart you'd break it (Baby, come back)
I know I made a mistake (I know)

Can't you stop your foolish pride?
And come back to me
Let's try, let's try, let's try, let's try it again
Baby, come back to me (Come back)

In my heart I still believe
We were meant to be (Oh, oh)
Together so whatever it takes (Baby, come back)
Baby, come back to me (Come back)
I should've never set you free
Love baby, come back (Baby, come back)
You know you miss your Baby V
And I can see that you think about me
So why do you act like you don't care? (Oh)
Like all this love between us isn't there
I know that you're upset (Hey) I know I did you wrong (Hey)
I know that you want me to pay for all the pain I've caused

But in the end it all comes down to just one thing
It's you and me
So, I sing (Baby, come back)
Baby, come back to me
In my heart I still believe (Oh, oh)
We were meant to be
Together so whatever it takes (Baby V) (Baby, come back)
Baby, come back to me (Come back)
I should've never set you free
Love baby, come back
Baby, come back
