Fly by, Frankie thinks he's superman
Like a child at the wheel of a rocket
He comes 'round here with a license to love
And I don't know where he got it
I trusted you offered everything
But I'm not sure you deserve it

You tell me that I'm lucky
But I feel like giving up
'Cause a heart like mine's wasted on you
If you don't know what you've got

You throw it away, throw it away
All the heart and the soul I've been givin'
You throw it away, throw it away
Like it's no big deal you'll be missin'
You throw it away, throw it away
Run it underground, ooh

Fly by, Frankie's got it in his head
That he's somethin', I know that he's not
He's like a blind bull in a china shop
When it comes to affairs of the heart

You wouldn't know what love is
If it hit you like a rock
And a girl like me is lost on you
If you don't see what you've got

You throw it away, throw it away
All the heart and the soul I've been givin'
You throw it away, throw it away
Like it's no big deal you'll be missin'
You throw it away, throw it away
Run it underground, ooh

Every breath in the park, every dance in the dark
Every promise you make, you go and throw it away
Every smile in the rain, you know, it's always the same
You go and do it again, you go and throw it away

You wouldn't know what love is
If it hit you like a rock
And a girl like me is lost on you
If you don't know what you've got

You throw it away, throw it away
All the heart and the soul I've been givin'
You throw it away, throw it away
Like it's no big deal you'll be missin'
You throw it away, throw it away
Run it underground, ooh

(You throw it away, throw it away)
Fly by, Frankie thinks he's superman
Like a child at the wheel of a rocket
(You throw it away, throw it away)
He comes 'round here with a license to love
But I don't know where he got it

(You throw it away, throw it away)
I don't know where he got it
(Run it underground, ooh)
I don't know where he got it
I don't know where he got it
