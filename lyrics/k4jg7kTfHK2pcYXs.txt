Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for the good intentions you hung me on
Still there's a feeling like all the things we left undone
Became the things I'm running from
Don't get me wrong...

We can escape the voices in our heads that break us down
Heavy lies the crown (don't forget about me)
Maybe you need some time to walk it off
Let it bleed, just don't forget about me (don't forget about me)
Woah-oh-oh-oh Heavy lies the crown
Woah-oh-oh-oh Heavy lies the crown

You need to know that I don't hold a thing against you
That much is true
You did what you could, sometimes we get the best of ourselves
Break it down so we can rebuild
We can rebuild

We can escape the voices in our heads that break us down
Heavy lies the crown (don't forget about me)
Maybe you need some time to walk it off
Let it bleed, just don't forget about me (don't forget about me)
Woah-oh-oh-oh Heavy lies the crown
Woah-oh-oh-oh Heavy lies the crown

I understand the feeling of thinking you've failed me
I understand the blaming and the pain that it brings
(the pain that it brings, the pain that it brings)
(just let it go, the pain that it brings)
(the regret and the pain that it brings)

We can escape the voices in our heads that break us down
Heavy lies the crown (don't forget about me)
Maybe you need some time to walk it off
Let it bleed, just don't forget about me (don't forget about me)
Woah-oh-oh-oh Heavy lies the crown
Woah-oh-oh-oh Heavy lies the crown
