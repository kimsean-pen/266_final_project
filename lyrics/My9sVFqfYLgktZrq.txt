I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keepin' it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize, if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And fallin' apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it
You can't fight
But the truth is

You can pretty lie
And say it's okay
You can pretty smile
And just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But, you can't cry pretty

Oh no, you can't dress it up in lace or rhinestones
Don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're lookin' in the mirror
A picture of pain
So let it flow like a river

You can pretty lie
And say it's okay
You can pretty smile
And just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But, you can't cry pretty

You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is goin' to waste
When things get ugly
You just got to face that you can't cry pretty

Oh, no, you can't
Ooh, yeah

'Cause you can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is goin' to waste
When things get ugly
You just got to face that you can't cry pretty
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah

No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
No no no no no no no no no no no no no wooh
You can't cry
You can't cry pretty no no
No, you can't cry pretty ya
