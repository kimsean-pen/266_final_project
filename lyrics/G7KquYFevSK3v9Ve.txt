Fraud, you're not a friend to me
A drag on society
A tool of bureaucracy
And I can barely tolerate you fuckers around me
Nightstick to the fucking face
How does that shit fucking taste?
Just to survive is never enough
We need to call the bluff

Disarray (disarray)
In the nation (in the nation)
Disarray (disarray)
Degradation

Face down
Face down
Face down to the ground
Face down (face down)
Face down (face down)
Face down to the ground

Brutality against brutality
The real face of the enemy
Keep them pigs away from me
Abuse of power and authority
Blacklisted calamity
Forceful rape entity
Devils in uniform
You'll wish you were never born

Disarray (disarray)
In the nation (in the nation)
Disarray (disarray)
Degradation

Face down
Face down
Face down to the ground
Face down (face down)
Face down (face down)
Face down to the ground

One, two, three

Menace to society
Cop shoot cop mentality
A cancer of a broken land
Traitor to the common man
Traitor to the common man
Invaders of your privacy
Nothing is sacred reality

Kill or be killed

Wrong it is
Where this started
Wrong it is
From the beginning
From the beginning
From the beginning
From the beginning
From the beginning

Wrong it is (wrong it is)
Where this started
Wrong it is
From the beginning

Bleed from the eyes
Rot from the inside out
Inverted skies
Hide in the underground
