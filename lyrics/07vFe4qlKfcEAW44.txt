Do you remember, remember the days
Life was easy, we felt no pain
Do you remember, remember the time
Love was passion and there were no crimes, but...

Eyes grow weak and skin gets tight
I know we gotta walk that mile
Eyes grow weak and skin gets tight
I know we gotta walk that mile

Oh, can we go walkin' together
Through the streets of Amsterdam
Stop for a coffee, it was stone cold
Nevermind, we could just let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll
We could just let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll

You could be Yoko and I could be John, yeah
We'll stay in bed and they'll ban the bomb
Our clutching hands, dodging bikes and trams
I wanna see you in a neon glass

Eyes grow weak and skin gets tight
I know we gotta walk that mile
Eyes grow weak and skin gets tight
I know we gotta walk that mile

Oh, can we go walkin' together
Through the streets of Amsterdam
Stop for a coffee, it was stone cold
Nevermind, we could just let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll
We could just let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll

Tryin' means nothin' at all
Tryin' means nothin' at all
Means nothin' at all
Means nothin' at all

Oh, can we go walkin' together
Through the streets of Amsterdam
Stop for a coffee, it was stone cold
Nevermind, we could just let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll
We could just let it roll

Can we go walkin' together
Through the streets of Amsterdam
Stop for a coffee, it was stone cold
Nevermind, we could just let it roll

Ooh yeah
Can we go walkin' together
Through the streets of Amsterdam
Stop for a coffee, it was stone cold
Nevermind, we could just let it roll
Let it roll
Can we go walkin' together
Through the streets of Amsterdam
