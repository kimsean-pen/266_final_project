The echo of the world
Throughout time
Reproduction, failing to ignite
The life of what had turned into light
Cold reflection hanging in the night
A sharp and empty climb to realize
Advertised immaculate design
The life you want to live idealized
Breaks apart the world around me

Things I can't remember
This is not where I would
Want to care about my life

Old time mutilated
Strung out on the pavement
Nothing's stopping them this time

Going on and on and on and on and on
Going on and on and on and on and on
Forward arc, forward arc
Forward arc, forward arc

The echo of the world
In my time
You'll never take it back
The echo of the world
In my time
You'll never take it back
The echo of the world
The echo of the world
The echo of the world
You'll never take it back
The echo of the world
The echo of the world
The echo of the world
You'll never take it back
