It's been a while since I was lost for words
Need I wasn't static and stutters
I never knew a love that doesn't hurt
Feeling the heat and the burn

Just give me one good reason
Drop everything and leave it
Seconds away from turning this car back around
Something about your feeling, pushing and pulling me in
And now my walls fall down

Usually fearless, why am I scared of happy?
Usually fearless, why am I scared of happy?
I'm afraid of nothing, I'm afraid of no one
Used to be fearless, why am I scared of happy?
Scared of happy

There is something good in sticking to your guns
No one to blame but yourself
I take a step back and I breathe for once
This is what I want

You give me one good reason
Drop everything and leave it
Seconds away from pulling up outside your door
Something about your feeling, pushing and pulling me in
That's why I come back for more

Usually fearless, why am I scared of happy?
Usually fearless, why am I scared of happy?
I'm afraid of nothing, I'm afraid of no one
Used to be fearless, why am I scared of happy?
Scared of happy

When it all goes down, when it all goes down
Will you still be around?
I'm coming back, no more running away

Usually fearless, why am I scared of happy?
Usually fearless, why am I scared of happy?
I'm afraid of nothing, I'm afraid of no one
Used to be fearless, why am I scared of happy?

Why am I scared of happy? Scared of happy
Why am I scared of happy? Scared of happy
Why am I scared of happy? Scared of happy
Why am I?

Used to be fearless, why am I scared of happy?
Usually fearless, why am I scared of happy?
I'm afraid of nothing, I'm afraid of no one
Used to be fearless, why am I
Why am I scared of happy?
