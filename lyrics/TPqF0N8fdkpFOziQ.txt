They want to shut you up
And put your mind in a cage
Dictate the words that you can use
Freedom of speech goes up in flames

When the censorship begins
They will come for you
Speaking your mind becomes a sin
Political correctness breaking through

With the suppression of ideas
Everyone pays the price
Beware of this because
Political correctness ends your rights

When the censorship begins
They will come for you
Speaking your mind becomes a sin
Political correctness breaking through

P.C. warriors want to force you to speak their way
P.C. warriors want to prohibit what you can say today
That's right

Political correctness: free speech is seized
Political correctness is a social disease
Political correctness: free speech is seized
Political correctness is a social disease
Fuck it

Political correctness: free speech is seized
Political correctness is a social disease
Political correctness: free speech is seized
Political correctness is a social disease

Fuck P.C.
