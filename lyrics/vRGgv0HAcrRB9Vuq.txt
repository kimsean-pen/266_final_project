Guitar case

ive go your picture in my guitar case. i guess that im just a hopeless case. but just in case you can call me on the telephone. you know that i will always be at home. all alone. ever since we first met dont you know ive been waiting, for you to call me up. thinking, that you might stand me up. hoping, that you would look me up. i know you have things to do. and so do i, a girl like you is a breath of fresh air in a smoke filled room like when we met two weeks ago. lucky for me that you had a picture with you or i might never have seen you again. your a diamond in the rough, lillies from the mud, needle in a haystack, one in a million. and taht is good enough. ive go your picture in my guitar case. i guess that im just a hopeless case. but just in case you can call me on the telephone. you know that i will always be at home. all alone. ever since we first met dont you know ive been waiting, for you to call me up. thinking, that you might stand me up. hoping, that you would look me up. i know you have things to do. and so do i, a girl like you is a breath of fresh air in a smoke filled room like when we met two weeks ago. lucky for me that you had a picture with you or i might never have seen you again. your a diamond in the rough, lillies from the mud, needle in a haystack, one in a million. and taht is good enough.
