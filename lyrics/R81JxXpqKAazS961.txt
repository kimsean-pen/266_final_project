Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the déjà vu
We've seen it all before

I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before

Are we close enough?
There is something I must confide
I think we've lost our touch
There's no sparkle in those eyes

What an awful mess I've made
There's nothing left to save

Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the déjà vu
We've seen it all before

I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before

There's nothing in the air tonight (nothing in the air tonight)
There's nothing in the air tonight
There's nothing in the air tonight

Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend there's a war
And I'm drowning in the déjà vu
We've seen it all before

I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before

I'm sorry, love it's not enough
We shouldn't feel the love so painfully
It hurts right to the touch
I know it stings, I know this cuts
And I wish I could agree with you
But fuck this love, it's not enough

It's not enough
It's not enough
