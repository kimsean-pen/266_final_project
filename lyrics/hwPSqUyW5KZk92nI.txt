I'll take Manhattan
The Bronx, and Staten Island too
It's lovely going through
The zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know?
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me, what street
Compares with Mott Street in July?
Sweet pushcarts gently
Gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

Tell me, what street

Sweet pushcarts gently
Gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

I'll take Manhattan
I'll take Manhattan
