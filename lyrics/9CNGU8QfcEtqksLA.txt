Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
Do shit feel like I won't ever make it home
Traffics backed up I got to get off of this road
Foot on the gas I swear to god I'm in my zone
Foot on the gas I can't stop I got tippy toes yeah I'm in my zone
I got paid today, gas up in my tank,
trust me when I say nothings in my way
Staying in my lane, fast car,
race car games, this car in my name, drop top fuck the rain
Running all red lights,
skrting left go right, I know wrong go right, I'm on go tonight
If I drive off the bridge,
tell them that I live, my life like a kid, captain of my ship
If I should lose control,
my body and soul, I pray you would know which way to go
This shit feel like I won't ever make it home
Traffics backed up I got to get off of this road
Foot on the gas I swear to god I'm in my zone
Foot on the gas I can't stop I got tippy toes I'm in my zone
Red light, green light, yellow light, green light, red light,
green light, yellow light, green light, red light,
green light, red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, stop, green light, go, yellow light, slow down,
green light, oh no, red light, green light, yellow light,
green light, red light, green light, yellow light, green light
They can't take my attitude
Shortcut is the avenue
Shit I had to move
Did what I had to do
You do good they get mad at you
Got a two seater but it's only me
Ran another red light now they on to me
Seat belt off seat up high
Hope they don't pull me over drive
