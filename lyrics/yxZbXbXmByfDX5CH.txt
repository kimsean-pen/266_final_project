Out of my garden, passed the battle cruiser
We jumped over cemetery gates
There on the wasteland, we saw the horizon
I noticed your pupils dilate

They're at it again
Let's roll just like we used to
In fields when we were young
Our hearts got lost in the circles
We had it all, a rise and fall

Came from the booze and the fags generation
And prayed for the mayhem to start

You said you were foolish but I saw the genius
In pulling the stitches apart
They're at it again
let's roll just like we used to
In fields when we were young our hearts got lost in the circles
We had it all, a rise and fall

So raise your glass to the ones who have passed
And the ones that got away, ohh
They're at it again, let's roll just like we used to
In fields when we were young our hearts got lost in the circles
We had it all, a rise and fall
I saw her face, way out in space
