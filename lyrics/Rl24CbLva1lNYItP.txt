Maybe we believe
she was ready to go
in the morning light
maybe you believe
that she was made of gold
In the east where you killed her
You lead us
When you need to feed us
you comfortably delete us
when you need your feed us

You cheat us when you
feed us with the lie
stars look out and
cheat us when you

feed us with the lie

stars look out
Goodbye, goodbye
she speaks unrehearsed
languages from skin
in the morning light
painting shadows on the

faces of the dead
in front of their widows
you cheat us when you
feed us with the lie

stars look out and
cheat us when you
feed us with the lie
before it's too late
do you know that life is ending
as we go, the dots connecting

we had our chance to save the garden

as it dies, our souls will harden
with these words chastising
your conscience
we're breaking through and
praying for transcendence.
but you deceived us all now
you cheat us when you
feed us with the lie
stars look out and
cheat us when you
feed us with the lie
stars look out
cheat us when you
feed us with the lie
stars look out and
cheat us when you
feed us with the lie
stars look out.
