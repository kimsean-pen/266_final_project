I can't wait to get to school each day
And wait for you to pass my way
(Then bells start to ring)
And angels start to sing
Hey, that's the girl for you
(Ooh, yeah)
So what are you gonna do
(Ooh, baby)
Hey, little girl I love you so
(I love you so)

All I do is think of you
Day and night, that's all I do
(That's all I do, baby)
I can't get you off my mind
(Off my mind)
Think about you all the time, all the time

I begun to take the long way home
Just so I can be alone
(To think of how to say)
You're fine in every way
Hey, I'm in love with you
(Oh, I love you baby)
I think the world of you
(Ooh, yes I do)
Oh, won't you please, please be mine
(Please be mine)

(All I do is think of you)
Baby, day and night that's all I do
I can't get you
(Off my mind)
Think about you all the time, all the time, ooh

(Girl you're so doggone fine)
Baby, I love you
Think the world of you, ooh

(All I do is think of you)
Day and night, that's all I do
Ooh baby, can't get you off my mind
I've been dreaming about you
(I've been dreaming about you)

(All I do is think of you)
Oh baby, I keep thinking about you
(Day and night, that's all I do)
All night long, oh
(I can't get you off my mind)
Day and night, that's all I do
