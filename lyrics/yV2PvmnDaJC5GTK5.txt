Think of your fellow man
Lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see it's getting late
Oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart

And the world (the world) will be a better place
And the world (the world) will be a better place
For you (For) and me (and me)
You just wait (You just wait) and see

Another day goes by
Still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
You want the world to know
We won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart

And the world (the world) will be a better place
And the world (the world) will be a better place
For you (For you) and me (and me)
You just wait (You just wait) and see, yeah

Take a good look around
And if you're lookin' down
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide
Kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart

And the world (the world) will be a better place
And the world (the world) will be a better place
For you (For you) and me (and me)
You just wait (You just wait) and see

Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart (Now, just a little bit longer now)
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart (Said put it in your heart)
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart (I know, I know, I know, I know)
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart (You gotta put it in your heart, now)
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart (Na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na)
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart (I said I know, I know, I know, know)
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart (Whoa, oo)
