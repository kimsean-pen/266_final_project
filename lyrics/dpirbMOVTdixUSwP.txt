[Kim]
Blasted earth
All immersed
Golden cave
The blondes come first

I love the way you move
I hope it's not too late for me
It's too good on the sea
where the light is green,
where the light is green

Jagged brain
Slow refrain
We love the jams,
and jams run free

I love the way you move
I hope it's not too late for me
It's too good on the sea
where the light is green,
where the light is green

Jagged brain
Slow refrain
