I thought that being skinny was the answer to all my problems
I thought if you found me pretty then I'll be fine
I thought if you loved I'd be a person
It's only if you wanted me but I have peace of mind

I thought being smart meant impressing others
I thought growing up meant pressing the lies
I thought I had to be someone in order for you to like me
Couldn't see I already was long before you crossed my mind

So if I'm ugly
Well I'm so much more than that
I'm so much more than you'll ever know
Oh if I'm ugly
I am still so much more than that
I'm so much more than you'll ever know

I thought I had to be everything that you could ever need
I thought I had to be strong so that you'd never hurt
I thought the biggest thing in life was to live for someone else
But I kept on failing and it led me in the back

So if I'm ugly
Well I'm so much more than that
I'm so much more than you'll ever know
Oh if I'm ugly
I am still so much more than that
I'm so much more than you'll ever know

But I looked at my own mother
Who told me to be strong
When the world urged me to be better
She assured me it will

So if I'm ugly
Well I'm so much more than that
I'm so much more than you'll ever know
So what if I'm ugly
I am still so much more than that
I'm so much than you'll ever know
