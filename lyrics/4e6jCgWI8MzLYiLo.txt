Oh, what a day
I lost my body
A feast for beast
And all mankind

I am prescription filled
For your mind
And the tyrants had their party
While the people fell to pieces
Were grassed out
Can't you see us?
Well, they've clearly lost their mind

They will come to live again, again
(Against your body)

So where is god?
He has no say here
At least the beast is fleeting to
We have an unstrung face for old time
Let the masters have their money
While the people pray to picture
Work of peace and in the houses
We have clearly missed the point

They will come to live again, again
(against your body)

What can we say?
We have no army
At least the east will rise a sun
I am so lonesome now for a ty
And the tyrants had their party
While the people fell to pieces
Were grassed out
Can't you see us?
What?
They've clearly lost their mind

They will come to live again, again
