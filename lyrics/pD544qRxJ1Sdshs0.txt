Closing doors
Opens eyes
To the fatal gift
Of a well timed lie
Loved in the flesh
And (but) butchered in the mind
Oh what a pearl
What a well made world

Closing doors
Opens eyes
To the fatal gift
Of a well timed lie
Loved in the flesh
And (but) butchered in the mind
Oh what a pearl
What a well made world
Oh what a pearl
What a well made world
Holy globe
Eternal home
Sacred sphere
So glad I'm here
Oh what a pearl
What a well made world
Oh what a pearl
What a well made world
Oh what a pearl
What a well made world
Oh what a pearl
What a well made world
Oh what a pearl
What a well made world
