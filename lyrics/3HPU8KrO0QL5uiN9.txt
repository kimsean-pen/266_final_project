Dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Dance, dance, don't hold the wall
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall

Come on the floor with them legs
Was getting down but I get up
Cause I heard you tell your girlfriend that I deserve better
Well, I think you look better
But you're so far, I had to go get ya'

Take you to the light
It's dark in the back
You started moving
You put an arch in your back
Closer to me, closer to me
Sippin' your drink
And you're getting closer to me
Dance in the light
Starting to see
You started moving
You're getting closer to me
And now you won't even let me go

So baby hold up
Dance, don't hold the wall
Let go
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Baby hold up
Dance, don't hold the wall

Let go
Dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, (What you do to me?)
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall

Dance, dance, (What you do to me?)
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, dance, don't hold the wall
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall

I think I heard what you said
He's not what you thought and you're fed up
I heard your girlfriend tell you, you could do better
Well, I'm the best ever
But you're so far, I had to go get ya'

Take you to the light
It's dark in the back
You started moving
You put an arch in your back
Closer to me, closer to me
Sippin' your drink
And you're gettin' closer to me
Dance in the light
Starting to see
You started moving
You're getting closer to me
And now you won't even let me go

So baby hold up
Dance, don't hold the wall
Let go
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Baby hold up
Dance, don't hold the wall

Let go
Dance, don't hold the wall

Dance, (What you do to me?)
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Dance, dance, (What you do to me?)
Da-da-dance
Dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, don't hold the wall

Baby hold up

Dance, don't hold the wall
Let go

Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Baby hold up
Dance, don't hold the wall
Let go
Dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, (What you do to me?)
Dance, don't, don't, don't hold the wall
Dance, dance, (What you do to me?)
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall
