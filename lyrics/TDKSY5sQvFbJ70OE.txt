Cherry blossoms falling from the sky
Cherry blossoms falling from the sky
Cherry blossoms blind me as I rise

Pink lovely, they're looking at the view
White grove, been a chain or two
I always knew there was no fruit to body
Now I got the world, ooh, baby
I'm like a lion coming out to play
I throw confetti at my own parade
Lights on, and the gates are high
Can't live no other way, let me die under.

Cherry blossoms falling from the sky
Cherry blossoms falling from the sky
Cherry blossoms blind me as I rise

It's like I'm only throwin' severs
It's like they on the first to lie
Up so high, I'm barely breathing
Lavender beneath my eyes
If you're a tide, I'm the moon
Everything I make's for you
Pails on the ground beneath me
Can't live no other way, let me shine under.

Cherry blossoms (Cherry blossoms), falling from the sky
(Got a lot to learn if you wanna live this life)
Cherry blossoms blind me as I rise
(I'm going blind, I can't see, I need you all around me)

Cherry (Cherry, cherry)
Cherry (Cherry, cherry)
Cherry (Cherry), cherry (Cherry, cherry, cherry)
Cherry (Cherry, cherry)
Cherry
