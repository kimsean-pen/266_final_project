Whoa-o-ah-oh
Whoa-o-ah-oh (x4)
Moving
Before the beam
I'm hyponotized
By it's gleam
Created by love
This feeling makes me groove
This energy
The load of forces
Carry me over the top
and i'm going
hard to stop I'm hungry
I'm hungry for your touch
Feel the rhythm, feel the soul

Whoa-o-ah-oh
Whoa-o-ah-oh (x4)
This maddness
Is sweeter than cocaine
takes control of my brain
it's pure, it's safe
[her] reflection of the soul
deep down in my heart
filling a hole
created by hate
the fact - the fact that I'm alone
her face has turned to stone
Feel the rhythm, feel the soul

Whoa-o-ah-oh (x4)
Whoa-o-ah-oh (x4)
Feel the rhythm, feel the soul
Lords of Acid Take Control
