I'm back in my house
And you're still sitting down
The crimson couch
Has never felt so uncomfortable
And the room is so cold

The tape on your mouth
Is slowing your breath down
The rope is still tight
The tension becomes so tangible
So unbearable, so unbearable

You love me 'cause I hate you
(Everything but love)
You love me 'cause I hate you
(Everything but love)

I'm sorry if I crossed the line
I know I've lost it but
You are always on my mind
Obsessed with you and me
To love is harder than you think

I'm sorry if I raise my voice
I never meant to hurt you
But I had no choice
Don't ever lie to me
'Cause I am smarter than you think

You love me 'cause I hate you
(Everything but love)
You love me 'cause I hate you
(Everything but love)

There's no running away
There's no guilt and no shame
I've crossed the line
Is this the end?
There's no running away
Even if you're afraid
I'll make you mine
Until the end

You love me 'cause I hate you
(Everything but love)
You love me 'cause I hate you
(Everything but love)

There's no running away
There's no guilt and no shame
I've crossed the line
Is this the end?
'Cause no running away
Even if you're afraid
I'll make you mine
Until the end

You love me 'cause I hate you
