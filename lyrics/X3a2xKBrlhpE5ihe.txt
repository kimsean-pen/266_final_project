We got a fucked up reason to live
Who really gives a fuck?
We're gonna wake up hate
We're gonna fuck you up
I wanna break everything
I wanna make it sting
We're gonna wake up hate
We're gonna wake it up
You gotta get it straight
We're gonna give it up
We're gonna wake up hate
We're gonna fuck you up
I wanna break everything
I wanna make it sting
We're gonna wake up hate
We're gonna wake it up

I am the burden of my everything, an open scar
I'll be reborn in hatred, feeling I can't love no more
I've had to suffer
I cannot wait for more
No loving and no praying
All my hate is for the taking

We got a fucked up reason to live
Who really gives a fuck?
We're gonna wake up hate
We're gonna fuck you up
I wanna break everything
I wanna make it sting
We're gonna wake up hate
We're gonna wake it up
You gotta get it straight
We're gonna give it up
We're gonna wake up hate
We're gonna fuck you up
I wanna break everything
I wanna make it sting
We're gonna wake up hate
We're gonna wake it up

I am the falling of my happiness, it is no more
Stop loving, I'm still hating till I cannot hate no more
I've had to suffer
I cannot wait for more
No loving and no praying
All my hate is for the taking

I'm, I am filthy
Wasted piece of shit
I am disgusting
Take me away

We got a fucked up reason to live
Who really gives a fuck?
We're gonna wake up hate
We're gonna fuck you up
I wanna break everything
I wanna make it sting
We're gonna wake up hate
We're gonna wake it up
You gotta get it straight
We're gonna give it up
We're gonna wake up hate
We're gonna fuck you up
I wanna break everything
I wanna make it sting
We're gonna wake up hate
We're gonna wake
We got a fucked up reason to live
Who really gives a fuck?
We're gonna wake up hate
We're gonna fuck you up
I wanna break everything
I wanna make it sting
We're gonna wake up hate
We're gonna wake it up
