Fallen angel, the broken arrow
She comfort me and ease my troubled mind
Shine a light out into the shadows
All the world they made me leave behind

Leave me in peace, I'm on the side of the angels
If I die in a dream then let me live my life
But all the lies that they have told me, they make me wanna shiver
When I'm lost and I'm lonely
That's not gonna ease my troubled mind

She's rolling over, a misty morning
Set the sail for where the four winds blow
She's a siren and I'm a warning
Here to say I never told you so

Leave me in peace, I'm on the side of the angels
If I die in a dream then let me live my life
But all the lies that they have told me, they make me wanna shiver

Leave me in peace, I'm all alone with my angel
She's died in a dream, so I could live my life
But all the lies that they have told me, they make me wanna shiver
When I'm lost and I'm lonely
That's not gonna ease my troubled mind
