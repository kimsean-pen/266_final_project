There's too many things that i haven't done yet
Too many sunsets
I haven't seen
You can't waste the day wishing it'd slow down
You would've thought by now

I'd have learned something
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I made up my mind when I was a young girl
I've been given this one world
I won't worry it away, no
But now and again I lose sight of the good life

I get stuck in a low light
But then love comes in
How far do I have to go to get to you
Many the miles
Many the miles
How far do I have to go to get to you

Many the miles
But send me the miles and I'll be
Happy to follow you love
I do what I can wherever I end up
To keep giving my good love
And spreading it around

Cause I've had my fare share of take care and
goodbyes
I've learned how to cry
And I'm better for that
Sing, how far do I have to go to get to you

Many the miles

Many the miles
Oh oh oh
How far do I have to go to get to you
Many the miles
Send me the miles and I'll be happy to, yeah

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Red letter day, I'm in a blue mood
Wishing that blue would just carry me away
I've been talking to God don't know
If it's helping or not
But surely something has got to got to got to give
Cause I can't keep waiting to live
How far do i have to go to get to you
Many the miles
Many the miles
How far do i have to go to get to you
Many the miles
But send me the miles and I'll be happy to yeah
How far do I have to go to get to you
Many the miles
Many the miles
How far do I have to go to get to you
Many the miles
Many the miles

I've been talking to God don't know if it's helping or not
Many the miles
Many the miles
How far do I have to go to get to you
Many the miles
Oh send me the miles and I'll be happy to
Follow you, love
There's too many things I haven't done yet
Too many sunsets I haven't seen
