I wanna know where we're headed
Where we're traveling to
Let's try to recreate what we had, but make it new
No mistakes
Make it our way
Let love be
We tried and failed previously
But understanding wasn't on our side
Eyes shut, couldn't see
Be open and certain
Maybe we'll win

B-Sect
I know that we can do this thing
We've got to work hard, but we'll achieve
You'll see
I'll put all of me if you'll put all of you
50 & 50
That's how we'll be, baby

Chorus
See, if we really, really want it we can have it (we really want it)
And if we really, really want we could (we really should)
See if we really, really want it we can make it right (we'll make it right)
So if we really, really want we should
So be it, baby

Let's make it right this time
Let's keep it on lock
We'll be as real as possible, so baby no lie
This is me
What you see
Don't change me
Don't listen to no one else, do what you do
They'll only try to hate, so baby let's keep it cool
If I love you
And you love me
It's all gravy baby

B-Sect

Chorus

Bridge
I'm keeping it simple y'all
But this is the deal y'all
All the things that make it work
Baby, this has to come first
Let's not make the same mistake
That make us destined to break
Let's erase all the flaws in the past
If we really, really want this to last

Chorus
