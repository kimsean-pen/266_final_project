Tied flowers in the laces of my boots
They're scared, drain the color from my mood
I took one too many beatings
I was left broken and bleeding
I woke up and covered up my bruise

Hey, hey, I feel it
Hey, hey, I know it
Hey, hey, I give myself

A friendly reminder
Remember to smile
Remember the pain only lasts for a while
(Take it, take it all away)
Throw away the last two years in the past
I tell it to myself right now
A friendly reminder
(Take it, take it all away)

The next time that I'm feeling so damn low
Keep telling myself that I'm not alone
I, no, I couldn't take it
I woke up in a wasteland
I retraced my steps to get back home

Hey, hey, I feel it
Hey, hey, I know it
Hey, hey, I give myself

A friendly reminder
Remember to smile
Remember the pain only lasts for a while
(Take it, take it all away)
Throw away the last two years in the past
I tell it to myself right now
A friendly reminder
(Take it, take it all away)

(Take it, take it all away)
(Take it, take it all away)

Down the drain I climbed my way out
Let it rain down then
(Take it, take it all away)
Do your worst
I-I'll be alright
One day at a time

A friendly reminder
Remember to smile
Remember the pain only lasts for a while
(Take it, take it all away)

A friendly reminder
Remember to smile
Remember the pain only lasts for a while
(Take it, take it all away)
Throw away the last two years in the past
I tell it to myself right now
A friendly reminder
(Take it, take it all away)

(Take it, take it all away)
(Take it, take it all away)
Throw away the last two years in the past
I tell it to myself right now
(Take it, take it all away)
Throw away the last two years in the past
I tell it to myself right now
(Take it, take it all away)
