Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Said we gotta warm this up with love

Only bout a day left till the world falls apart
Wishin' we could press restart,
Feeling like it's time for change
Gotta be a reason why we loose our minds,
everyone's wrong but everyone's right.
Tell me why we make it,
So complicated,
What are we gonna do

Can't let go when I fall
can't hang up,
Over call,
When we feel so alone
Everyone's watching me
And I pray when you bleed,
I love when you love,
I cry when you cry

That's the reason why
I'm turning up this song for freedom
It was up to believe it,
Cause the whole world is freezing
Need to warm it up with love
I've got so many reasons
For the truth that I'm speaking
And the hope we can see,
We need to warm it up with love

Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Said we got to warm it up with love

Running out of time and the game clock is winding down
Tell me how we turn that ground,
searching through the lost and found
looking for hope
What if we wake and the sun don't shine no more
Everybody locks that door
Tell me why we make it,
So complicated
What are we gonna do

Can't let go when I fall
can't hang up,
Over call,
When we feel so alone
Everyone's watching me
And I pray when you bleed,
I love when you love,
I cry when you cry

That's the reason why
I'm turning up this song for freedom
It was up to believe it,
Cause the whole world is freezing
Need to warm it up with love
I've got so many reasons
For the truth that I'm speaking
And the hope we can see,
We need to warm it up with love

Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Said we got to warm it up with love

It's like the pendant is broken,
Class act this place I'm hopin'
We make it out alive,
Downside it's looking better
I need some help, I want it,
Strong enough to do this for me
There's nobody here but us

And that's why I'm turning up this song for freedom
It was up to believe it,
Cause the whole world is freezing
Need to warm it up with love
I've got so many reasons
For the truth that I'm speaking
And the hope we can see,
We need to warm it up with love

And that's why I'm turning up this song for freedom
It was up to believe it,
Cause the whole world is freezing
Need to warm it up with love
I've got so many reasons
For the truth that I'm speaking
And the hope we can see,
We need to warm it up with love

Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Warm it up with love
Said we got to warm it up with love
