Do you want everything?
Then, you can have everything
But what is everything?
(Worth?)

Do you wish for nothing?
Then, you will have nothing
Now, that is something

Do you wanna see it all?
Well, you can just open your eyes
The one who is prepared, is never surprised

Do you wanna question everything?
Then, think of a good question

Do you wanna start a fire?
Well, you can watch it burn

Do you wanna learn?
Then, shut up and learn

Do you wanna learn?
Then, shut up
Shut up
Shut up and learn

Shut up!
Shut up!
