Penetrating voices going through my head
I haven't listened to a thing they said
Always they removed the answers
I won't suffer the consequences

Torn between the two
Right or wrong, there is no answer
Don't tell me what to do
It's my choice, I'm taking a chance, yeah

Don't dictate, don't dictate, don't dictate, dictate to me
Don't dictate, don't dictate, don't dictate, dictate to me

Don't dictate, don't dictate, don't dictate, dictate to me
Don't dictate, don't dictate, don't dictate, dictate to me

Don't dictate, don't dictate, don't dictate
Don't dictate, don't dictate, don't dictate

Don't dictate, don't dictate
