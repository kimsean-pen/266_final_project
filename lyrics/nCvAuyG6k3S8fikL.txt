I want a bad girl, like you
To slap me around when I'm not, telling the truth
I already told you, many times you make me crazy baby
Gimme one shot to show you, I'm not outsaught
You go out with your friends and fool around on the town
But they put on a show while you, stay bad to the bone
You're an east side Cinderella, oh baby
Gimme one chance for romance I could be your guy
Ooooh

See you cruising around on your cherry red Triumph '
Let me jump in the back and we'll be bad together baby
Just give me one shot to show you, I could be your guy
