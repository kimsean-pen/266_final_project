I
I am feeling like a veteran
Uncompensated for the blood I've left to pool on foreign grounds.
And I
Sometimes reach to rub at aching legs
But they've been dust for over a decade
And you're the limb i've lost but somehow I still feel it
Until I awake
We just hope that you made it.
We hope that you're celebrating.
With people you miss.
And burning like a beacon
Guiding our ship around this hellish shoal.
I'm happy to admit that maybe I am a little depressed
Cause I'm missing you to death.
And now
It's only records of my memory.
Some little thing you gave posthumously.
The details all dragged out.
To think
Of all the paintings we would be without
If Van Gogh had gone and died face down from loss of blood the night
He went and hacked his ear off
Until I awake
We just hope that you made it.
We hope that you're celebrating.
With people you miss.
And burning like a beacon
Guiding our ship around this hellish shoal.
I'm happy to admit that maybe I am a little depressed
Cause I'm missing you to death.
How many kids did we have?
How many hearts did we shake?
How many prisons did we break out?
How much love do we make?
Until I awake
We just hope that you made it.
We hope that you're celebrating.
With people you miss.
And burning like a beacon
Guiding our ship around this hellish shoal.
I'm happy to admit that maybe I am a little depressed
Cause I'm missing you to death.
Until I awake
We just hope that you made it.
We hope you're as decorated
As the day that you left.
And burning like a beacon
Guiding our ship around this hellish shoal.
I'm happy to admit that maybe I am a little depressed
Cause I'm missing you to death.
