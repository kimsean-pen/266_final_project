Oh no
Don't you dare
Girl, girl, girl, I'm warning you!
Ugh...
I think I have a crush
I can't!
I think I'm falling for him
Why not?

Women have been making bad choices since the beginning of time
Are you gonna be another one of mine?
Oh whoah

I used to think you were from outer space
Who's that bright-eyed guy in your place?
You're kind of cute when you're not so shy
Oh whoah

But I've been here before
Have I come back for more?
Another chapter in the history of wrong guys
You used to be so "Ehhhh"
A limp lackluster bore
But now you're changing into something I just can't ignore

Charlie, honestly
I've been hurt like this before
Is there really more to you
Than what I always thought?
How can you surprise me anymore?
Oh. Oh. Oh.

He's got a girlfriend, you flake. Why are they only nice when
they're unavailable?

Don't want to be another star-crossed lover.
We all know how that ends.
I'm better off without him
We're better off as friends.
But I've been here before
Have I come ask for more?

Another chapter in the history of wrong guys.
Yesterday no spark
No heart aching allure
But today I'm feeling
Something I just can't ignore.

Charlie, honestly
I've been hurt like this before
Oh. Oh. Oh

The history of wrong guys:
Chapter one - he's a bum
Two - he's not into you
Three - he's a sleaze
Four - loves the girl next door
Five - loves the boy next door
Six - don't love you no more
- makes you insecure
- makes you so unsure
- is so immature
- loves his mother more
- or...

... has a girlfriend named Nicola.

Charlie, honestly
I've been hurt like this before
I can see there's more to you
Than what I always thought
But I won't be burned anymore
Oh, oh, oh

Where you off to?

I've been exec-utized.
