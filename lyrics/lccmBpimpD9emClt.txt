I dance away from all my fear
Come back
My feet will move until I lie
Down there
My soul will dance over your house
Your house will never smile again

Take all your memories
Put them in your bag
'cause you need to run away
The dance is not over.

Remember light your house on fire
be quiet don't wake up the fear
it's sleeping, put your fear in the bag
hurry now, close it, laugh and leave.

Take all your memories
Put them in your bag
'cause you need to run away
the dance is not over

dance for us dance for us dance for us fear:
dance with us dance with us dance with us fear.
