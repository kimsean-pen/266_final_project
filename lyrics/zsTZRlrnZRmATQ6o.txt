Woh
Yeah
I feel guilty
My words are empty

No signs to give you
Don't have the time for you
You say I'm heartless
And you say I don't care
I used to be there for you
You've said I seem so dead, that I have changed but so have you
Guilty woh
Guilty, I feel so empty
Yeah
Empty you know how to make me feel
I put a shield upon you
Didn't mean to hurt you
Would've only poisoned your mind
Never meant to make you cry
You've been so thoughtless
I can see right through you

You used to be there for me
Don't you leave and say goodbye, you have changed but so have I
Guilty woh
Guilty, I feel so empty

Yeah
Empty you know how to make me feel
I never thought that the time and the distance
Between us made you so much colder
I'll carry the world on my shoulders
(Shoulders)
Guilty

Guilty
Woh
Guilty, I feel so empty

Empty you know how to make me feel

You know how to make me feel

So guilty
Empty
(Woh)
So empty, you know how to make me feel
