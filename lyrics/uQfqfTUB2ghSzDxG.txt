You're the direction I follow
To get home
When I feel like I can't go on
You tell me to go
And it's like I can't feel a thing
Without you around
Don't mind me if I get weak in the knees
'Cause you have that effect on me
You do

Everything you say
Every time we kiss I can't think straight
But I'm ok
And I can't think of anybody else
Who I hate to miss
As much as I hate missing you

Months going strong now
And no goodbye
Unconditional, unoriginal
Always by my side
Meant to be together
Meant for no one but each other
You love me, I love you harder
So...

Everything you say
Every time we kiss I can't think straight
But I'm okay
And I can't think of anybody else
Who I hate to miss
As much as I hate missing you

So please give me a hint
So please give me a lesson on how to steal
To steal a heart as fast as you stole mine
As you stole mine, yeah

Oh, and everything you say
Every time we kiss I can't think straight
But I'm ok
And I can't think of anybody else
Who I hate to miss
As much as I hate missing you
So please give me a hint
So please just take my hand
