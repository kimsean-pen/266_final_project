Revulsion

Lost in the implicit unknown
Impetuous dissent
Reject the cold and lifeless order
Offer nothing but reproach

Devalue the thoughtless waking breath
To belittle unseen dejection
Beyond concern of the impassive
The unavailing diminished

Adrift in salvation
Enraged to affliction

I am beholden to no one
The world disavowed
Deconstructing adversity
In fear

The aggrieved are without claim
Without sentence
Clutching revulsion
For those whose fear is just

Reckoning is upon the meek
