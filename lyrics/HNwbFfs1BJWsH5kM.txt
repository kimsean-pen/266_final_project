Guess who's back, but you never left
Yes I did, I rose from the dead
And now I'm here to kill them with flows
And some punch lines that'll go over your head

Drop, turn back I'm a caution ahead
I'm your worst nightmare stood over your bed
So them girl try call me
But I smell defeat like a hole in your creps
Wow, she's sick and she's bad
She sings and she raps
She's shit and she's wack
They talk all that chat
But when they see me don't speak none of that

Cause nobody bad like me
I'm fuckin' higher than a block of flats in Battersea
And I'm with my team (skwody)
Skwody, where you at my G's?

I'm rollin' ten girl up in that skwod
That's what? That skwod
I'm rollin' ten girl up in that skwod
That's what? That skwod

I'm rollin' ten girl up in that skwod
Fuckin' with my skwod? I think not
Me and my bitches we roll deep
And we always got green
So we pretty much peas in a pod

I was at the scene had to flee from the cops
I go inside with no keys for the locks
"Scuse me, Madam, how did you get on the premises?"
Well, I came to kill off my nemesis

So I used my juju and I came up in the crevices
Them bitches say their bad
But I'm from where the fuckin' devil is
So if they get me mad, we in the yard disturbing residents
Then we leave out the yard, hop in the car, dispose the evidence

Cause, nobody bad like us
But really we dont want no fuss
Someone roll them blunts, so we can turn shit up
Skwody, let me see you brush your guns

I'm rollin' ten girl up in that skwod
That's what? That skwod
I'm rollin' ten girl up in that skwod
That's what? That skwod

I'm rolling ten girl up in that skwody
Came tru with the clan, came tru with the posse
I came with Mary Jane's, I came in here with Molly
Nuff' girl in it, that's the way you roll skwody

Nuff' girl in it, that's the way you roll out
If the lighting's good, you have to get your phone out
Bare skin teeth when we pose for the photos
Some girl are braided, some girl are in cornrows

But still gon' dread if we have to
The heart is built like a statue
Been on my grind like my back tooth, yeah
Take out the time with a fat zoot
Step on the gas hit the back roads, why?

Cause if my bitches need me there, well I'm coming
And if I ain't gotta wish it, I'm runnin'
I do it for 'em, it ain't nothin', skwody
Let me see you brush your guns

I'm rollin' ten girl up in that skwod
That's what? That skwod
I'm rollin' ten girl up in that skwod
That's what? That skwod

I'm rollin' ten girl up in that skwod
That's what? That skwod
I'm rollin' ten girl up in that skwod
That's what? That skwod

I'm rolling ten girl up in that skwod
That's what? That skwody
That's the clan, that's the posse
That's them and that's moi
