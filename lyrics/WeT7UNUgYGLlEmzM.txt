Last night before us
I close tight your hold
And you come to me
When all is gone
You want me to fall back
The will is all dead

So let me come in
As one
So let me come in
As one

it's darkest for to see
I see it all
The light will only stall
And you come to me
When all is gone
I want me to fall back
You will die now
The will is all dead
