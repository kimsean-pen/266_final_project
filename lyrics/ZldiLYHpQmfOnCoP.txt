I've been thinking about going away
Somewhere that I can find a new day
Everybody's talkin' about this new place
Where no one remembers your face

Where they don't wanna know about the things you've done
They don't wanna know about the damage done
Everyone is going down...

Runaway, runaway to nowhere town
We're gonna go where we won't be found
Where the winners always win, the sinners always sin

Runaway, runaway to nowhere town
We're gonna go where we won't be found
Where the winners always win, the sinners always sin

We're on our way
We're on our way to nowhere

I heard you've been living e lie
If it's true then I won't ask why
Won't ask why

Cause they don't wanna know about the things you've done
They don't wanna know about the damage done
Everyone is going down...

Runaway, runaway to nowhere town
We're gonna go where we won't be found
Where the winners always win, the sinners always sin

Runaway, runaway to nowhere town
We're gonna go where we won't be found
Where the winners always win, the sinners always sin

We're on our way
We're on our way to nowhere

We're on our way
We're on our way to nowhere

Runaway, runaway to nowhere town
We're gonna go where we won't be found
Where the winners always win, the sinners always sin

Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway

The sinners always sin
The winners always
The sinners
The sinners always sin
