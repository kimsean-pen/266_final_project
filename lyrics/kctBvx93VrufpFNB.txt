As the morning turned my way
See birds flying through this hazy face
And I came back here to replace your place in my life

And didn't you know that I'm not the world's strongest man
When it comes to you and your world I'm lost
Can't you see the towers of mine they could shine like a dime
Take me back again to your warm desire

And again again again
Longing for belongings here again
And I need your love you know I can't pretend anymore

And didn't you know that I'm not the world's strongest man
When it comes to you and your world I'm lost
Can't you see the towers of mine they could shine like a dime
Take me back again to your warm desire
