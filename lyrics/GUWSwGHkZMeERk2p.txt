I got your letter
Today
An' I miss you oh so much here
I can't wait
To see you all
And I'm counting the days dear
I still believe that there's gold
At the end of the World
An' I'll come home
To Illinois
On the Day After Tomorrow
It is so hard
And it's cold here
And I'm tired of taking orders
And I miss old Rockford town
Up by the Wisconsin border
What I miss you won't believe
Shovellin' snow, and rakin' leaves
And my plane will touch down
On the Day After Tomorrow
I close my eyes
Every night
And I dream
That I can hold you
They fill us full of lies
Everyone buys
'Bout what it means
To be a soldier
I still don't know how I'm s'posed to feel
'Bout all the blood that's been spilled
Will God on his throne
Get me back home
On the Day After Tomorrow?
You can't deny
The other side
Don't wanna die
Any more than we do
What I'm tryin' to say
Is, don't they pray
To the same God
That we do?
Tell me
How does God choose?
Whose prayers does he refuse?
Who turns the wheel
Who throws the dice
On the Day After Tomorrow?
I am not fighting
For justice
I am not fighting
For freedom
I am fighting
For my life
And another day in the World here
I just do what I've been told
We're just the gravel on the road
And only the lucky
Ones come home
On the Day After Tomorrow
And the summer
It too will fade
And with it brings
The winter's frost dear
And I know
We too are made
Of all the things
That we have lost here
I'll be twenty - one today
I been savin' all my pay
And my plane
Will touch down
On the Day After Tomorrow
And my plane
It will touch down
On the Day After Tomorrow
