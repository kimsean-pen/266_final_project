I do what I want
I say what I want
I wear what I want
I'm walking away
You know I don't mind
I chill by myself
You know I'm flyin' high
I'm way up in the sky
Don't even have to try
'Cause I can see everything

Oh don't you dare
Go and push me around
'Cause I'll double down
'Cause I don't care
No not at all
And I never fall
And every time
I roll the dice
Snake eyes never come as a surprise
Dismantle you
With your own tools
No time to explain
You know I'm flyin' high
I'm way up in the sky
Don't even have to try
'Cause I can see everything

You ain't ever gonna get me down
You ain't ever gonna get me...

You know I'm flyin' high
I'm way up in the sky
Don't even have to try
'Cause I can see everything

You ain't ever gonna get me down
You ain't ever gonna get me down
You ain't ever gonna get me down
You ain't ever gonna get me down
