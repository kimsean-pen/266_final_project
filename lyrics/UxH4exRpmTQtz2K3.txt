And nothing more that keeps its sense
fire looses its warmth and its light
The truth is lost behind a fence
cannot show what is wrong and what's right

Just silence stays forevermore
To be an only friendly guest
To be a keeper of the lore
Which can't be found in your quest

But dusk and void became alive
They call, they pray, they whisper to be heard
And ask to join them, just to try
To turn into a songless bird

They ask, they call, they pray, they force
To leave your grave under grey stone
To cross all borders, break the doors
To understand that you are all alone
