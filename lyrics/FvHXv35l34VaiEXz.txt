it'll take you to the top
and out to the edge
shoot up needles through your blood
lay ice under your sledge

shift, crank, pull
shift, crank, pull
adrenaline, adrenaline

shift, crank, adrenaline

it'll put you through your paces
kickstart your heart
push you to the limit
make the finish just the start

shift, crank, pull
shift, crank, pull
shift, crank, pull
adrenaline

a-a-a-drenaline, adrenaline
a-a-a-drenaline, adrenaline

it'll save the life of a junkie
closing on death
counteract the poison
give him back his breath

shift, shift, crank, pull
shift, crank, pull
shift, crank, pull
adrenaline

a-a-a-drenaline, woah-ohhhh
a-a-a-drenaline, a-a-a-adrenaline

pushing flesh and marrow
kicking bone and blood
boosting up the cell count
as the burning (?) is flood

adrenaline, adrenaline
shift, crank, pull
shift, crank, pull

a-a-a-drenaline, shift, crank
a-a-a-drenaline, pull
a-a-a-drenaline, adrenaline
