As a young boy chasing dragons with your wooden sword so mighty
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast.
Times change very quickly
and you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet.

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
in a corner forgot by no one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his honour.

The smell of resined leather
The steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call.
He taught you all he ever knew
To fear no mortal man
and now you'll wreak your vengeance in the
Screams of evil men.

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
in a corner forgot by no one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his honour.

(Guitar Solo)

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
Caught up but got in the way.
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his honour.

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
Caught up but got in the way.
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his honour.
