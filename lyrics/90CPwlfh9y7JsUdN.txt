I can feel the change
Underneath the surface of your skin
Spreading like a wave
Waiting for the moment to begin
Nothing more to say
Even though I try and try again
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?

'Cause I've been thinking on it
I've been thinking on it now
Don't know how to numb it
Don't know how to tell myself

Just stop, breathe
Running out of ways, out of ways to take this patiently
I don't wanna stay, I don't wanna stay under

I try to find your clarity
Elevated over me
In the water, out of reach
Elevated over me

Elevated over me
Elevated, elevated
Elevated over me

Play into all the reasons that you've found
Just to fill this space
Why are you still keeping them around?
And how do I explain
When every move I make is frozen up?
Don't wanna feel this way
Don't wanna feel this way

'Cause I've been thinking on it
I've been thinking on it now
Don't know how to numb it
And maybe you should tell yourself

Just stop, breathe
Running out of ways, out of ways to take this patiently
I don't wanna stay, I don't wanna stay under
I try to find your clarity
Elevated over me
In the water, out of reach
Elevated over me

Elevated over me
Elevated over me
Elevated over me
Elevated over me

Even with the brightest color
I could never change your mind
We could never find each other
Caught between the black and white

Even with the brightest color
I could never change your mind
We could never find each other
Caught between the black and white

Elevated over me
Elevated, elevated
Elevated over me
Elevated, elevated
Elevated over me
Elevated, elevated
Elevated over me
