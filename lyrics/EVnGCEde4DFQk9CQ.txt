Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you, baby
Ah take me back

Take me back where I belong
That's with you, baby
I thought the grass was greener
On the other side

Thought the sun shone brighter
Without saying goodbye
There's a card in my hand
Tears fall like rain
I wanna come home again

I want you to take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you, baby
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you, baby

Ain't no love in this world
Ain't no love in this world without you
No, no
Ain't no love in this world
Ain't no love in this world without you

In my search to find myself
I saw your face and nothing else
Every place I go
Everything I do
I still feel the need for you

Come on and take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you, baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you, baby

I'm on my way back to you
And I wanna make it up to you
And all the problems
That I caused you
If it takes my life
I'll make it up to you

I just want you to take me, take me
Take me, take me, take me, take me
Take me back, forgive me
Take me back where I belong
If you can, if you can find it
In your heart to forgive me
Yeah, ah take me back where I belong
That's with you, baby
With you, with you, with you, darling
Yeah, yeah
Take me back
Yeah, take me back where I belong
That's with you, baby
Take me back
