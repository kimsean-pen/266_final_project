Jane walks back and forth from all the biggest parts of town
She's got a longer stride than many
But she's always looking down
Because her gaze is such
That it weighs too much
On the passersby

She likes some tall men
With at least half a brain
And all her barren chat
Keeps 'em coming back again
But her long stride
And her leopard hide
Is all I ever see

But there she goes in her trademark clothes
Away again on a private plane
Baby stay with me
Put on your dungarees
And if you're going out to smoke save one for me

My big town girl
Oh my big town girl

She's forever in a rush between no and maybe
One time I think I tried it on her but you know she's a lady
Oh she's got her way
And thinks I'm okay to be her pal

You know I've never had the time to wait around for a dame
But if I knew that we could make it I'd wait around for Jane
Could I suit her better
Than that dark blue sweater?
Probably not

But there she goes in her trademark clothes
Away again on a private plane
Baby stay with me
Put on those dungarees
And if you're going out to smoke save one for me

Bright lights
Big city
I got the top down
So do your hair up pretty babe
Desert palms and the silver screen
I got a valet ticket
So won't you ride with me?

And if it's all the same
Babe let's get out of the game
Give me half a chance
Cause you're due for some romance

And if the bright lights
Big city
I got the top down
So do your hair up pretty babe
Desert palms and the silver screen
I got a valet ticket
So won't you ride with me?

Bright lights
Big city
I got the top down
So do your hair up pretty babe
Desert palms and the silver screen
I got a valet ticket
So won't you ride with me?

Oh my big town girl
Oh my big town girl
Oh my big town girl
Oh my big town girl
