When you were gone
Sit and remember
The cold enemies all the night
All you never said is what I need
All you ever said is what I need

My friend, you again
In the dark behind the moon now
Told my new friend all in brown
All we ever needed was a doubt
All we ever wanted was a falling down

I see you in the morning
Night of falling bored ennui
All we ever needed was a moan
All we ever wanted was a falling down
