I don't want to be followed by sheep
Don't need the respect of the mentally weak
I have no interest in leading the blind
But walking amongst those people with open minds because I'm -
TUI, as long as I'm still alive
I live to spite you
I can't believe how stupid you must be
To follow everything that you read, hear, and see

TUI, as long as I'm still alive

I don't believe you
TUI, as long as I'm still alive
I live to spite you
Realize that I'm not one of your kind
I'm nothing like you
I'm nothing like you
