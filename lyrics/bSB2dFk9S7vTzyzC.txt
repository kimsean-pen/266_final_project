One, two, three...
I am the bullet, you are the bullseye
And when I hit, there's nothing left
I am the bullet, you are the bullseye
And when I hit, when I hit, there's nothing left

I've been living in a boundaryless land
I was blind but now I've got my sight back
You suffer insidiously, I fucking hate you
Stay the fuck away from me

I am the bullet, you are the bullseye
And when I hit, there's nothing left
I am the bullet, you are the bullseye
And when I hit, when I hit, there's nothing left

You're a thief, a liar and a cheat too
Ain't no mystery to unlocking you
You think I'm a sucker, oh, you're fucking sick
The only thing I suck is my man's dick

I am the bullet, you are the bullseye
And when I hit, there's nothing left
I am the bullet, you are the bullseye
And when I hit, when I hit, there's nothing left
