Is this real life or simulation?
Can't hold on for too long
Are we wrong or fixated?
We go on reused

They can't stop us
They can't stop us trying
They can't stop us
They can't stop us trying

I won't let you take me under
I overload and discover
I don't believe in this machine
Controlled by you, going nowhere

Is this real love or superstition?
Are we programmed to abuse?
If we suspend ourselves and wait for darkness
Can we prolong and seduce?

They can't stop us
They can't stop us trying
They can't stop us
They can't stop us trying
They can't stop us
They can't stop us trying
They can't stop us
They can't stop us trying

I won't let you take me under
I overload and discover
I don't believe in this machine
Controlled by you, going nowhere

I don't believe in this machine
I don't believe in this machine
They can't stop us
They can't stop us
