Ha ha ha
Ohh

Picture this, first kiss in the moonlight
Slow dance, cover band playing all night
Meant to be, cool breeze feeling so right
Picture this, picture this
Picture this, holding hands on the boardwalk
Perfect date, out late, making small talk
Arcade, playing games you can win it all
Picture this, picture this
When you look into your future
Who's there standing
With you when you close your eyes (hey hey)

Do you see what I see
You and me, it's like a movie scene
That's the way you know it should be
The two of us together, girl can you picture this
Whoa whoa whoa
Girl can you picture this
Whoa whoa whoa
The two of us together
Whoa whoa whoa
Girl can you picture this
Whoa whoa whoa
Girl can you picture this (oh oh oh)

Top down, ride around all day long
Watching you rockin' out to your favorite song
Fall asleep on the beach with our shades on
Picture this, (picture this) picture this (hey hey)
When you look into your future
Who's there standing
With you when you close your eyes (oh hey hey)

Do you see what I see
You and me, it's like a movie scene
That's the way you know it should be
The two of us together, girl can you picture this
Whoa whoa whoa
Girl can you picture this
Whoa whoa whoa
The two of us together
Whoa whoa whoa
Girl can you picture this
Whoa whoa whoa
Girl can you picture this

When you look into your future
Who's there standing
With you when you close your eyes (oh oh oh)

Do you see what I see
You and me, it's like a movie scene
That's the way you know it should be
The two of us together, girl can you picture this
Whoa whoa whoa
Girl can you picture this
Whoa whoa whoa
The two of us together
Whoa whoa whoa
Girl can you picture this
Whoa whoa whoa
Girl can you picture this
