And nothing makes you writhe
And nothing makes you move as far down the wild
A sudden gesture
Bruise your faith into right
Recharge your dimensions
Read yourself into history
Rewrite your dementia

These shadows take care of us / We come from
They cover us up in the shade / the ocean
And to the sky we're gonna move

These shadows take care of us / We come from
They cover us up in the shade / the ocean
And to the sky we're gonna move

You turn away
turn away
turn away

If it's nothing but a sign
Bleed onto your shoes, man
If it's nothing but a sign
Bleed onto your shoes, man

What's defined as right?
A simple nature
What's understood de-volved
From nothing to nowhere / Turn away
Please your numbers
Stay your numb friends
Plead to no one
Stay in nowhere / Turn away

These shadows take care of us / We come from
They cover us up in the shade / the ocean
And to the sky we're gonna move

These shadows take care of us / We come from
They cover us up in the shade / the ocean
And to the sky we're gonna move

Oh, oh.

If it's nothing but a sign
Bleed onto your shoes, man
If it's nothing but a sign / Revision, revision
Bleed onto your shoes, man / Revision, revision

These shadows take care of us / We come from
They cover us up in the shade / the ocean
And to the sky we're gonna move

These shadows take care of us / We come from
They cover us up in the shade / the ocean
And to the sky we're gonna move

These shadows take care of us / We come from
They cover us up in the shade / the ocean
And to the sky we're gonna move

These shadows take care of us / We come from
They cover us up in the shade / the ocean
And to the sky we're gonna move
