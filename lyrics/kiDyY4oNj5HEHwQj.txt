Cutting the cold
Of when we met
Burning our lungs
With a cigarette
And I don't know why you said
"I'm not afraid
Of running away with you
And all your pain."

'Cause when we touch, touch, touch
I feel you blush, blush, blush
Close your heart up, up, up
Breaking me down, down, down
'Cause when we touch, touch, touch
I feel you blush, blush, blush
Close your heart up, up, up
Breaking me down, down, down

Remember us now (remember us now)
And don't forget (and don't forget)
Swallow your pride (swallow your pride)
That's what you meant (that's what you meant)
And I don't know why you said (I don't know why)
You're not afraid (you're not afraid)
Of running away from me (of running away)
From the bed we made (the bed we...)

'Cause when we touch, touch, touch
I feel you blush, blush, blush
Close your heart up, up, up
Breaking me down, down, down
'Cause when we touch, touch, touch
I feel you blush, blush, blush
Close your heart up, up, up
Breaking me down, down, down

'Cause if we fell in love
If we had enough
Would you let me go
Would you let me go
'Cause if we fell in love
If we had enough
Would you let me go
Would you let me go

'Cause if we fell in love
If we had enough
Would you let me go
Would you let me go
'Cause if we fell in love
If we had enough
Would you let me go
Would you let me go

'Cause when we touch, touch, touch
I feel you blush, blush, blush
Close your heart up, up, up
Breaking me down, down, down
'Cause when we touch, touch, touch
I feel you blush, blush, blush
Close your heart up, up, up
Breaking me down, down, down

'Cause when we touch, touch, touch
I feel you blush, blush, blush
Close your heart up, up, up
Breaking me down, down, down
'Cause when we touch, touch, touch
I feel you blush, blush, blush
Close your heart up, up, up
Breaking me down, down, down

I'm still in love
Of when we met
With heaviest hearts
We were a silhouette
