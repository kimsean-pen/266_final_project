(Woods/Cannon arranged by Svanoe/Darling)

Walk right in, sit right down, baby let your hair hang down
Walk right in, sit right down, baby let your hair hang down
Everybody's talking 'bout a new way of walking
Do you want to lose you mind
Walk right in, sit right down, baby let your hair hang down

Walk right in, sit right down, daddy let your mind roll on
Walk right in, sit right down, daddy let your mind roll on
Everybody's talking 'bout a new way of walking
Do you want to lose you mind
Walk right in, sit right down, daddy let your mind roll on

Walk right in, sit right down, honey let your hair hang down
Walk right in, sit right down, honey let your hair hang down
Everybody's talking 'bout a new way of walking
Do you want to lose you mind
Walk right in, sit right down, honey let your hair hang down

Walk right in, sit right down, baby let your hair hang down
Walk right in, sit right down, daddy let your mind roll on
Walk right in, sit right down, honey let your hair hang down...
