Music is power
Let it flow through your mind
Your just like a flower
In the deep sunshine

Are you invited
To the party of life?
Now you've been sighted
Do you live 'til you die?

These are wild, wild, wild days we live in
Yes, I know sometimes we all wanna give in
These are strange, strange vein days of living
Yeah, I know sometimes we all wanna give in

Don't give up
Oh, no, all right
Let the melody flow
All night, all night

'Cause music is power
It's easily sold
Rocking like a cradle
It won't let you go

If the melodys timeless
It won't let you down
Feel the air moving
Submit to the sound

In these wild, wild, wild days you live in
Yes, I know sometimes you all wanna give in
These are strange, strange vein days of living
I know sometimes we all wanna give in

Don't give up
Oh, no, all right
Let the melody flow
All night, all night

After all we go through
The endless crime
Bad days, good fortune
Are things you find

'Cause music is the mantra
Unwinding your head
Music is the question
To things unsaid

These are wild, wild, wild days you live in
Yeah, I know sometimes we all wanna fit in
These are strange, strange vein days of living
Yeah, I know sometimes that ya just don't fit in

Don't give in
Don't give up
Don't pack it up
Stop cracking up

Let the song
Carry you on
Keep you strong

Don't wanna control ya
'Cause music is the power

Submit to the sound
Feel the air moving, moving
Submit to the sound
Feel the air moving, moving
