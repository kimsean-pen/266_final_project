Celia, you're breakin' my heart
You're shakin' my confidence daily
Whoa, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm beggin' you please to come home, ah

Celia, you're breaking my heart
You're shakin' my confidence daily
Whoa, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm beggin' you please to come home
Come on home

Makin' love in the afternoon with Cecilia
Up in my bedroom (Makin' love on my bed)
I got up to wash my face
When I come back to bed someone's taken my place

Celia, you're breakin' my heart
You're shakin' my confidence daily
Whoa, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm beggin' you please to come home
Come on home

Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up

Jubilation, she loves me again
I fall on the floor and I'm laughin'
Jubilation, she loves me again
I fall on the floor and I'm laughin'
Woah, woah, oh
Woah, woah, oh
Woah, woah, oh
Woah, woah, oh
Woah, woah, oh
Woah, woah, oh
