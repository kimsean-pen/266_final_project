I saw you smile
I knew you had spirit
Oh, won't you let your colors run
Isn't it odd, the way we try to tell ourselves we got limits
You're beautiful, but you just don't see it sometimes
And I don't know why

Oh, you're the shape of my days
Oh, you're my holy place
And I know

Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone with me
Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone with me
When I fall, I'm fine
All I wanted was your time
Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone, alone with me

I'll sit right here, till you start talking
I'll wait it out till you come 'round
It pays to look up in the big city
Everything moves so fast
It pays to look up
'Cause you don't know what you might see
When you look around

Oh, you're the shape of my days
Oh, you're my holy place
And I know

Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone with me
Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be

When we're alone
Here I am, saying things to you
I never thought that I'd I would say outside my head
Oh, and here we are
I'm doing things with you I never thought we'd do
I'm seeing into you

Oh, you're the shape of all my days
Oh, you're my holy place
And I know

Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone with me
Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be
When we're alone
When I fall, I'm fine
All I wanted was your time
Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone, alone with me

You're alone with me, babe
You're alone with me
You're alone with me, babe
You're alone with me
You're alone with me, babe
You're alone with me
You're alone with me, babe
