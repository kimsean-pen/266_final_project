I never wanted this to happen
On that day
Wanted to stay inside
And watch the rain

We walked down to the water
Hand in hand
I knew it was the last time
On the sand

In the freezing wind
I'm looking at your face
Your thoughts are running
As you turn away

Grey skies on the outskirts
Of this town
I'm heading home
It's time to settle down
