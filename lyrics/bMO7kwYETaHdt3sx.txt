I don't wanna move
I'll just sit here in my living room and
See what's on the tube
While I'm hanging out with you

People knock on my door, ringing my phone, telling me the things I gotta get done today
To satisfy them, but what about me?
Lately I've been wishing I was brain dead, no responsibilities in my head today
Baby, let's see what's on TV

Doing nothing, having fun
Off to bed to get things done
I'm not lazy
I'm in love

I don't wanna move
I'll just sit here in my living room and
See what's on the tube
While I'm hanging out with you

People pressing my flesh, taking my time, they don't know a thing about my life with you
I'm trying real hard, hard not to care
'Cause all I ever really want to do is sit around doing nothing with you, because
Nothing's only fun when you're there

"Mad About You" at dinnertime
"Seinfeld," "Simpsons," "So-Called Life"
Seen the reruns
20 million times

I don't wanna move
I'll just sit here in my living room and
See what's on the tube
While I'm hanging out with you

All I wanna do
Is just sit here in my living room and
See what's on the tube
While I'm hanging out with you

All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do is do nothing with you
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do is do nothing with you
