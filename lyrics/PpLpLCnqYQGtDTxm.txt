How will they know just where to find?
Under this bridge I lie down.
See how they run catch butterfly.
Trip over words with gifts and garage.
Pheurton.

How will they learn just where to find?
Down on their knees holding hairpiece.
See how they flock ten for some grapes.
Trip over words with gifts and garage.
Pheurton dance.

How will they learn x3
