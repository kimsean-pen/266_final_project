Ask for money, and get advice
Ask for advice, get money twice
I'm from the dirty, but that chico nice
Y'all call it a moment, I call it life

One day when the light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment
Oh oh...
I just wanna feel this moment
Oh oh...
I just wanna feel this moment

Mr. Worldwide
Christina Aguilera
Oye mamita, come on, dale
Que la cosa esta rica
(I just want to feel this moment)

Feel this moment...

Reporting live, from the tallest buildings in Tokyo
Long way from them hard ways
Filled with zoes and oye's
Dade county always, 305 all day
Now baby, we can parlay
Oh baby, we can party

She read books
Especially 'bout red rooms and tie ups
I got her hooked
'Cause she see me in a suit with the red tie tied up
Christian Gris, nice to meet ya
But time is money
Only difference is I own it
Now let's stop time and enjoy this moment

One day when the light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just want to feel this moment
Oh oh...
I just wanna feel this moment
Oh oh...
I just wanna feel this moment

Feel this moment...

I see the future but live for the moment
Make sense don't it? Ha
Now make dollars, I mean billions
I'm a genius, I mean brilliant
The streets are what schooled him
And made him slicker than slick, Rick the ruler
I've lost a lot, and learned a lot
But I'm still undefeated like Shula
I'm far from cheap
I break down companies with all my peeps
Baby we can travel the world
And I can give you and all you can see
Time is money
Only difference is I own it
Like a stop watch, let's stop time
And enjoy this moment, dale

One day when the light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment
Oh oh...
I just wanna feel this moment
Oh oh...
I just wanna feel this moment

Come on, feel this moment...

Oh oh...
I just wanna feel this moment
Oh oh...
I just wanna feel this moment
