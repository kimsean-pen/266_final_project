I can't understand the city
And I don't understand true love
And I've been under false impressions
Of even where I thought I was
Heavy are the open-hearted
And heavy is the fate of love
Yeah here I go from town to town
Just getting by on old true love

Love's sick and so backwards by you
Love's sick in town
Gonna need to call the CDC
'Cause it's going around

On and on and on we're getting
Conjuring a tidal wave
Standing on the cliffs and laughing
And running down the fire escape
A step ahead a roll of thunder
And only every turning does
Heavy are the open-hearted
And heavy is the fate of us

Love's sick and so backwards by you
Love's sick in town
Gonna need to call the CDC
'Cause it's going around

They say that love is blind
But you look good to me
And there's a reason that I'm coming over
And it ain't up to me

True love
Is there any wonder darling
That I don't understand true love
On and on and on we're getting
Conjuring our own true love
A step ahead a roll of thunder
And all we have our own true love
And heavy are the open-hearted
Heavy is our own true love

Yeah I was so free and lonely
And missing of all true love
Is it any wonder darling
That I don't understand
True love
