The air
Escaping from your mouth
The hair
Escaping from your nose
My heart
Escaping from the scraping
And the shaping
Of the draping...
I'm awaking
In a t-shirt
In a chevy
At a beach
And I'm freezing
And I'm wheezing
And I know
You were only teasing
Then I hit you
And I beat you
And told you
That I love you
In my car
In a jar

The air
Escaping from your pits
The hair
Escaping from my teeth
My hands
Are gripping
But they're slipping
And they're dripping
'cause I'm tripping
I got busted
Coming through customs
With a suitcase
Full of tapes
It was special
Tape recording
And they grabbed me
While I was boarding
Then they hit me
And they beat me
And they told me
They don't like me
And I crashed
In my nash
We can crash
In my nash
Etc.
