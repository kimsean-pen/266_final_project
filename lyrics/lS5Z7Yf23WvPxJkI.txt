Lights, Lights turn off the lights. Where no one sees the
Lies, lies turn off the lies. It doesn't really matter what is
Left, Left or what was right. Time to get addicted.
Time to get addicted. Shut the lights!
And fill out all the space under the sky!

Anyone can see the space beneath the sky. Insomniac alibis.
Anyone can fill the space beneath the sky. Insomniac alibis.

Don't be shy, don't rewind!
You are already focussed, all of your goals are golden.
No regrets, you need this.
Your socks have been knit, your shoes have been

Tied, tied, everything's fine. You're dressed to
Fight, fight, stop being tired.
Stop being tired, cut all the wires!
Stop, Stop rubbing your eyes.
Time to get addicted. Time to get addicted.
Your shoes are tied.
So fill out all the space under the sky!

Anyone can see the space beneath the sky. Insomniac alibis.
Anyone can fill the space beneath the sky. Insomnia.
