I woke up with the rising sun
I was blinded by the light
Jump up and pull on my jeans
It feels good, they're a little tight
Step out in a crazy world
But then the sun resets your mind
Feel the weight of it all just drift off
On a cloud to another time
Ooh, ooh, ooh, hello, hello
Ooh, ooh, ooh, hello, hello
I'm feeling alive again
Alive again
I'm feeling alive again
Alive again
Like the way that you drive your car
I like the way that you turn the key
Can't stop thinking about you, baby
You don't know we are the real deal
Here we are on a perfect night
The sky is clear and the moon is full
Looking out at the universe
And then the stars and the heavens with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, hello, hello
Ooh, ooh, ooh, hello, hello
I'm feeling alive again
Alive again
I'm feeling alive again
Alive again
I wanna get you tonight
I wanna get you tonight
I wanna get you tonight and I
I wanna get you tonight
I wanna get you tonight
I wanna get you tonight and I
Ooh, we're all alone
Ooh, we're all alone
I wanna get you tonight
I wanna get you tonight
I wanna get you tonight and I
Feeling alive again
Alive again
Feeling alive again
Alive again
I'm feeling alive again
Alive again
I'm feeling alive again
Alive again
