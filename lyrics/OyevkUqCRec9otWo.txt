Rehab doll's got a bug that bites
She picked it up in a shared blood rite
Take one down, pass it around
Take one down, pass it around
Take as many down with you as you can

The river in the city is pumping sewage
The river in the city runs brown
The river in the city is pumping sewage
Rehab doll says she craves a fix

Rehab doll's in for quite a kick
Ten to one says that it won't stick
Take one down, pass it around
Take one down, pass it around
Take as many down with you as you can

Rehab doll stays up all night
Shakin', shakin', shakin' yeah, don't feel quite right
Take one down, pass it around
Take one down, pass it around
Take as many down with you as you can
We all fall down
