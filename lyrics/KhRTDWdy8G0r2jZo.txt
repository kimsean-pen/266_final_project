alone to live with my own thoughts
the burning, it won't stop
the air is all gone,
i'm falling and can't stop
the end is on my mind
the end is alright
the only chance i got is to elevate my mind
before i leave my side
i'm running out of time
the end is on my mind
the end is on my mind
the only chance i've got
is to elevate my mind
before i leave my side
i'm running out of time
alone
alone
alone
