Oh

Love, did you ever walk like no one could walk
And the trees they could walk
And one little key just unpicked the lock
'Cause love

I rolled down the hills like a ball
The world, nothing at all
And the wildest mountains seemed suddenly small
'Cause love

Did it ever feel like you fell from the sky
And no one asked, why?
And everything moved like a young butterfly
'Cause love

If you miss it, try again
It belongs to you, my friend

Love, I don't think it begins or it ends
The lovers, the friends
And one thing for sure you can never pretend
To love

It goes places the mind cannot go
Only history knows
That nothing was made by a single red rose
'Cause love

Right between the invisible, the true, bang out of the blue
And all the days were made by you
'Cause love

But if you miss it, try again
It belongs to you, my friend

Love, it's not the thing that they said it would be
The bending of the knee
A thousand violins singing into the sea
'Cause love

Won't be found in the lines of the page
The screens, the stage
And sometimes your heart cannot be saved
By love

It's just a word that came out of a mind
The blind, led the blind
And I for one could never decide about love

But if you miss it, try again
It belongs to you, my friend

Oh, love

If you miss it, try again
It belongs to you, my friend

Oh, love

If you miss it, try again
It belongs to you, my friend
