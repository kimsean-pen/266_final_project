Something's hidden not new
Out of view over our minds
Inching cross the sky
Obscure the view
The view from our eyes
Convenience making a pact the other side
Just out of sight
That's the truth
The mindless hum
But how's the view to satisfy the active mind
Hazy minds static hums to reach the end
Now it's done
Something sitting in view in a zoo within our minds
Witchy creature views defines anew
Confused with no signs
An animal will distract the other side
Its dug in sight now fetching truth
Ascended hums but how's the head
What satisfies the painful mind
Crazy times vicious hearts reaching ends
Feel like someting dead might blow by
The dry something knows by goes by
A need to bleed at what's not open
A need to steal at what's unbroken
Feel like something dead might blow by
The dry something knows by goes by
A need to bleed at what's not open
A need to steal at what's unbroken
Know why no one know why no one
The animal sad refrain
Don't ask again never asking again
Who speaks the truth
Realigning the sun catches a tune
Never finding the news
That soothes the mind
Feel like something dead might blow by
The dry something knows by glows by
The need to bleed at what's not open
A need to steal at what's unbroken
Feel something dead might blow by
The dry something knows by goes by
The need to bleed at what's open
A need to steal at what's unbroken
Crazy times vicious hearts reaching ends
Feel like something dead might blow by
The dry something knows by blow by
The need to feed at what's not open
A need to steal at what's unbroken
The need to bleed at what's not open
The need to steal at what's unbroken
The need to bleed
The need to steal
Don't ask again

"...poison is regularly disributed to the population..."

Lies
Who speaks the truth
Catches a tune
The other side the other side the other side the other side
