You're breakin' my heart
You're tearin' it apart
So fuck you

All I want to do
Is have a good time
Now, I'm blue
You wanna boogaloo
Run down to Tramps
Have a dance or two, oo-oo
You're breaking my heart
You're tearin' it apart
But fuck you

You're breakin' my heart
You're tearin' it apart, oo-oo
You stepped on my ass
You're breaking my glasses, too
You wanna drive my car
Buy a lot of stuff
I've had enough
Of you, oo
I'm goin' insane
There's no one to blame
So fuck you

You've gotta have your way
There's nothin' left to say
There's nothin' left to do, oo-oo
You're breakin' my heart
You're tearin' it apart
So fuck you

You've gotta have your way
There's nothin' left to say
There's nothin' left to do, oo-oo
You're breakin' my heart
You're tearin' it apart
But I love you
