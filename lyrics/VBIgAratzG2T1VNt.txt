If you want more beats for your buck, there's no luck
If you want more beats for your buck, there's no luck
If you want more beats for your buck, there's no luck
If you want more beats for your buck, there's no luck

Then there's no luck
Then again if you came for drama then I can't understand
Music critics, music critics
Not afraid of a guy who'll tell you he's never been in a mix
Been in a mix, been in a mix
We're from the grassroots, so big up to out friends
Every crew, every click and every posse
Big up to all the heads not of hypocrisy

You're a transistor
Lightning resistor, conducting to the mother star
That's what you are

Renegade sound system, three eleven
Renegade sound system, three eleven
Renegade sound system, three eleven
Renegade sound system, three eleven

Three eleven
Brothers from another planet and here once again
Automatic, automatic
Quantum saints of the universe in a holographic
Cosmic Remix, Cosmic Remix
From the mysterious blue planet
We can breathe anywhere
Underwater, out in space and in L.A.
Your polluted air's no problem for these homeys

You're a transistor
Lightning resistor, conducting to the mother star
That's what you are

You're a transistor
Lightning resistor, conducting to the mother star
That's what you are
