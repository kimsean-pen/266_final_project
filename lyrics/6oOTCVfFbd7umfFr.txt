I can't hold this state anymore
Understand me anymore

To tread this fantasy, openly
What have I done
Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over

I can't mold this stage anymore
Recognize me anymore

To tread this fantasy, openly
What have I done
Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over
Is taking me over

To tread this fantasy, openly
What have I done
Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over
Is taking me over
Is taking me over

Yes, it's all over, yeah
Oh, it's all over, yeah, oh oh oh
