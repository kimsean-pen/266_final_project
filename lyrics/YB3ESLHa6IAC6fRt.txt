Heyyy
I'm tired to be losed
Actions speaks louder then words
If you feel me
Run away where you will be
Have more limit to be free
You release me ...

Take me away

Take me away
Take me away
Oooh...
Take me away
La la la...
I'm tired to be losed
Actions speaks louder then words
If you feel me
Run away where you will be
Have more limit to be free
You release me ...
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Oooh...
Take me away
