Sometimes it's easy to be around you
Sometimes it's hard for me to be there too

But when the night kicks in
That's when you know what is left
You turn me inside out when you sleep, so I can't rest
Now there's no turning back
'Cause I can see just me
I don't want--

(Close to)
(I don't want--)
(Close to)

I've had enough of you
And your stupid talk
You think I'm stuck with you, but I'm not
'Cause I don't want--

(Close to you)
(I don't want--)
(Close to you)

I don't want to, want to be close to you
No, I don't want to, want to be close to you

Sometimes you ask me if I'm okay
(If I'm okay)
(If I'm okay)
But you don't listen, you just walk away
(Just walk away)

But when the night kicks in
That's when you know what is left
You turn me inside out when you sleep, so I can't rest
Now there's no turning back
'Cause I can see just me
I don't want--

(Close to)
(I don't want--)
(Close to)

I've had enough of you
And your stupid talk
You think I'm stuck with you, but I'm not
'Cause I don't want--

(Close to you)
(I don't want--)
(Close to you)

I don't want to, want to be close to you
No, I don't want to, want to be close to you
