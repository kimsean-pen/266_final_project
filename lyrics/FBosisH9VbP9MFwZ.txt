Sent west
Senseless
And way out
let the eyes in for the answers
in a wasteland, baby

Let the rain through your hands
Let the rain through your hands

Always I'll take good love
oh anything I might say
I'll place for a little longer out

Cold pressed
Temptress
Of silence
Let the morning call and answer
And ransom
The day off

Let the rain through your hands
Let the rain through your hands

Always I'll take good love
Oh anything I might say
I'll place for a little longer out
