My exit, unobserved, my homesickness, absurd
I said "water," expecting the word
Would satisfy my thirst!
Talking all about the second and third
When I haven't understood the first.

Jonah, where's that boat going -
Your ship set with eager sails?
There's a swirling storm soon blowing
And no use, fishermen, in rowing from a consecrated whale!

And just like the clouds they bring a darkness and a hard rain's gonna fall
I felt the crowds bring a loneliness and a hard rain's gonna fall.

She always weighed me down
But, afraid I might need her, I dragged her around
(It's best to keep close sackcloth and ash in a whitewashed town)
She wore that phony smile on her face,
I guess like a bandage on a wounded place
While I kept the keys to every old lock just in case.

Rehearsed indifference tossed aside,
Our narrow arms spread wide,
"What unseen pen etched eternal things on the hearts of humankind -
But never let them in our minds?"

The clouds they brught a darkness
And a hard rain's gonna fall
And all my laughter ends in emptiness
And a hard rain's gonna fall.
My every medicine causes more illness
And a hard rain's gonna fall
And until I let you go I didn't know, you were never mine at all

But now I spend my days in ever-increasingly complicated ways
Convincing myself of the rightness of each word I say
My exit, unfair if unobserved! My exit, unfair if unobserved!
Ya sabur, subhannallahi, a-uduhu billah minash-shaitnair-rajim, al-hamdu lillah, bismillahir rahmanir rahim.
