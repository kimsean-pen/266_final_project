Primal evil, what am I?
Tongue tied 'til the day I die
There's no love made with mermaids
It's just distraction so they say

And I'm too tired to care about it
Can't you see this in my face? My face

When I feel this strange can I go through this again?
When I feel this strange can I go through this again?

It's a sorry state you're getting in
The same excuse is wearing thin
There's no self control left in me
What was not will never will be

And I'm too tired to care about it
Can't you see this in my face? My face

When I feel this strange can I go through this again?
When I feel this strange can I go through this again?

[Incomprehensible]
I don't want

And I'm too tired to care about it
Can't you see this in my face?
The emphisis is on coping
Can't you see this in my face? My face

When I feel this strange can I go through this again?
When I feel this strange can I go through this again?
When I feel this strange can I go through this again?
When I feel this strange can I go through this again?
(Can I be dreaming or am I just coping?)
