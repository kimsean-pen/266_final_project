Says he wants you, he says he needs you
It's real talk, then why not make him wait for you
If he really wants you, if he really needs you
Really got to have you
Take your time and feel him out
When he's a good boy, I mean a really, really good boy
Why not let him lay with you
That's when you give it to him good

Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back roll
Pop, pop, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, "Oh"

Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back roll
Pop, pop, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, "Oh"

You're gettin' bold, he's growin' cold
It's just the symptoms of young love growin' old
You think it's done
Then you're thinkin' of leavin', but give it time
It's late at night, he's comin' home
Meet him at the door with nothin' on
Take him by the hand, let him know what's on
If you understand me up and move

All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move (move)
All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you wanna do
(Show her what you got dirty)
All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move (How to move it on)
All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you wanna do (Ooh... hoo... ooh...)

Dip it low, pick it up slow (Oh)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back roll
Pop, pop, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, "Oh"
(I'mma show you how to make him)

Dip it low (Ooh), pick it up slow (How to make it)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back roll
(Said I'mma show you how to make it)
Pop, pop, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, "Oh"

We can move if you wanna
We can move if you wanna
We can move if you wanna
We can move...

Dip it low, pick it up slow (slow)
Roll it all around (ohhhh)
Poke it out let your back roll
Pop pop pop that thing (yeah)
I'mma show you how to make your man say "Oh"
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around
Poke it out let your back roll (come on come on come on)
Pop pop pop that thing
I'mma show you how to make your man say "Oh" (ooooh)

Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around
Poke it out let your back roll
Pop pop pop that thing
I'mma show you how to make your man say "Oh"
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around
Poke it out let your back roll
Pop pop pop that thing
I'mma show you how to make your man say "Oh"
