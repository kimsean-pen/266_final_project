Soil, God of All Decay
Awakened from the Depths
As All Life Rots Away
Existence Lies Beneath
Shedding Its Mortal Shell
Embalmed In Eternity
Dormant Remnants of Disease
Memories of Extinction
Spawning the Chaotic Breed
Testing the Limits of Humanity
Distilled Human Beings
Grotesque Creations
Core of Life
Genetic Infiltration
What Lies Beneath...
Execration of Pain
The Bells of Sodom Echoing
Sacrilege Through Sacrifice
In Agony Crucified
Gasping for the Breath of Life
Shattered Boundaries of the Mind
Swarming Evil Cries
Living Dead, Petrified
Rebirth of Swarm Emerging
Infecting By Instinct
The Void Between States of Being
Forming the Body of Hate
