How stubborn are the scars when they won't fade away?
Or just a gentle reminder that now are better days?

We'll be home soon, so dry your eyes
You'll be okay (You'll be okay!)
Oh, my God!
The water is rising!
It's rising!
You just have to believe in me!
Failing that I'll ride this storm alone!
We can still make it out!
Fuck

I can help you through this!
But you have to take my hand!
I can take you home!
Take my hand, take my hand!

I should've known
The tides were getting higher
We can still survive
And I think we're drowning
But our heads are still above the waves
Above the waves

(I should've known the tides were getting higher)
(We can still survive)
(Above the waves)
(I should've known the tides were getting higher)
(I should've known the tides were getting higher)
We can still survive

You
Never said
Goodbye, goodbye!
You
Never said
Goodbye, goodbye!
You
Never said
Goodbye, goodbye!
You
Never said
Goodbye!
And now you're on your own!
You
Never said
Goodbye!
You
Never said
Goodbye, goodbye!
