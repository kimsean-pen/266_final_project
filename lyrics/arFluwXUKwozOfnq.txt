oooooo.
fall in light, fall in light.
fall in light, fall in light.
feel no shame for what you are (X 5)

as you now are in your heart
fall in light
feel no shame for what you are
feel no shame for what you are
feel it as a waterfall
fall in light, ooh.
fall in light, fall in light,
fall in light, ooh.
fall in light, fall in light fall in light,
grow in light.

stand absolved behind your electric chair, dancing.
stand absolved behind your electric chair, dancing.
past the sound within the sound.
past the voice within the voice.
ah. ah. ah.

leave your office, run past your funeral,
leave your home, car, leave your pulpit.
join us in the streets where we
join us in the streets where we don't belong.
don't belong.
you and the stars throwing light.

oooooo (repeat) fall, fall.
oooooo fall in, fall in light.
fall in light, ooo.
fall in light, fall in light
fall in light. grow in light.
