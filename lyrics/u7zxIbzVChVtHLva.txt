Now just let me sleep
I don't wanna talk
have nothing nice to say
I'm just sleeping in your hand

don't wake me up too soon
I don't want to see the world
I need to be no one
all I want is just to be

we can be so strange
we can be so wild
even when we love
even when we lie

be conscious of my love

please just let me float
nothing matters less than time
my thoughts are so remote
your hand is open wide

we can be so strange
we can be so wild
even when we love
even when we lie

yes we can be so strange
we can be so wild
even when we touch
even when we die

I'm sleeping in your hand
I'm sleeping in your hand
I'm sleeping in your hand
I'm sleeping in your hand

be conscious of my love
be conscious of my love
