I like to stay in holy places,
I'm happiest on consecrated groundI worship the earth
that I walk on, I seldom eat anything but sacred cowI
work in the church of my SOULMy head holds a temple
and a THORNY CROWNI am pure of heart but salvation
ain't enoughI am destined to live on the STREET OF
SHAMEI'm on a death knell - in a heavenly hellYeah,
I know, they got me againNailed me to a crucifix,
whipped my chestGambled for my rags,
smoked my fags, carved up my back,
hack hack hackCarved up my back,
hack hack hack, CARVED UP MY BACK,
HACK HACK HACKHammered a screwdriver into my ear to
my brainI'm watchin' my life swirl down the drain and
I feel about as Abel as CainBut I guess that that's
the price of fame when you're destined to live on aSTREET
OF SHAMEI can't shut off my ears to that infernal internal
DESTINED TO LIVE ON THE STREET OF SHAME"I can't shut
off my ears to that infernal internal refrain.
."YOU ARE DESTINED, DESTINED TO LIVE,
DESTINED TO LIVE ON THE STREET OFSHAME"I'm an angel
who'se had his wings clipped - an angel in devil's
bootsAN ANGEL IN DEVIL's BOOTS?
Sling-back pumps for a cloven hoofSomeone's tied TIN
CANS TO MY TAILSomeone's always driving in ONE LAST
NAILI'm trying to use my halo as a life preserver but
it's sprung a leakTHIS IS HOLY MURDERI'm watching my
life swirl DOWN THE DRAINAnd I feel about as ABEL AS
CAINBut I guess that that's the PRICE OF FAMEWhen you're
destined to live in a STREED OF SHAME"YOU ARE DESTINED
TO LIVE, DESTINED TO LIVE,
DESTINED TO LIVE ON THESTREETOF SHAME"I'M ON A DEATH
KNELL... IN A HEAVENLY HELLI can't shut off my ears
to that infernal internal refrain.
."YOU ARE DESTINED, DESTINED TO LIVE ON THE STREET
OF SHAME... STREET OF SHAME!"
