haunt me
in my dreams
if you please
your breath is with me now and always
it's like a breeze

so should you ever doubt me
if it's help that you need
never dare to doubt me

and if you want to sleep
i'll be quiet
like an angel
as quiet as your soul could be
if you only knew
you had a friend like me

so should you ever doubt me
if it's help that you need
never dare to doubt me
