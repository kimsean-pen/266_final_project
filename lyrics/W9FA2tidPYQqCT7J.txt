I've seen love go by my door
It's never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
Shooting in the dark too long
But something not right, it's wrong
You're going to make me lonesome when you go

Dragon clouds so high above
I have only known careless love
It has always hit me from below
But this time around it is more correct
Right on target, so direct
You are going to make me lonesome when you go

Purple clover, Queen Anne lace
Crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry if you don't know
Can't remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoiling me with too much love
You are going to make me lonesome when you go

Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time

Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine has been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud
But there is no way I can compare
All those scenes to this affair
You are going to make me lonesome when you go

You are going to make me wonder what I am doing
Staying far behind without you
You are going to make me wonder what I am saying
Make me give myself a good talking to

I will look for you in old Honolulu
San Francisco, Ashtabula
You are going to have to leave me now I know
I'll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass in the ones I love
You are going to make me lonesome when you go
Oh, you are going to make me lonesome when you go
Oh, you are going to make me lonesome when you go

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You are going to make me lonesome when you go
