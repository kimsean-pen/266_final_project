Well Jo'anna she runs a country
She runs in Durban and the Transvaal
She makes a few of her people happy oh
She don't care about the rest at all
She's got a system they call apartheid
It keeps a brother in subjection
But maybe pressure can make Jo'anna see

How everybody could live as one
Gimme hope Jo'anna
Hope Jo'anna
Gimme hope Jo'anna
'Fore the morning come
Gimme hope Jo'anna
Hope Jo'anna
Hope before the morning come
I hear she make all the golden money
To buy new weapons any shape of guns
While every mother in black Soweto fears
The killing of another son
Sneakin' across all the neighbours' borders
Now and again having little fun
She doesn't care if the fun and games she play
Is dang'rous to ev'ryone
Gimme hope Jo'anna
Hope Jo'anna
Gimme hope Jo'anna
'Fore the morning come
Gimme hope Jo'anna
Hope Jo'anna
Hope before the morning come
She's got supporters in high up places
Who turn their heads to the city sun
Jo'anna give them the fancy money
Oh to tempt anyone who'd come
She even knows how to swing opinion
In every magazine and the journals
For every bad move that this Jo'anna makes
They got a good explanation
Gimme hope Jo'anna
Hope Jo'anna
Gimme hope Jo'anna
'Fore the morning come
Gimme hope Jo'anna
Hope Jo'anna
Hope before the morning come
Gimme hope Jo'anna
Hope Jo'anna
Gimme hope Jo'anna
'Fore the morning come
Gimme hope Jo'anna
Hope Jo'anna
Hope before the morning come
Even the preacher who works for Jesus
The Archbishop who's a peaceful man
Together say that the freedom fighters
Will overcome the very strong
I wanna know if you're blind Jo'anna
If you wanna hear the sound of drums
Can't you see that the tide is turning
Oh don't make me wait till the morning come
Gimme hope Jo'anna
Hope Jo'anna
Gimme hope Jo'anna
'Fore the morning come
Gimme hope Jo'anna
Hope Jo'anna
Hope before the morning come
Gimme hope Jo'anna
Hope Jo'anna
Gimme hope Jo'anna
'Fore the morning comes
Gimme hope Jo'anna
Hope Jo'anna
Hope before the morning come
Gimme hope Jo'anna
Hope Jo'anna
Gimme hope Jo'anna
'Fore the morning comes
Gimme hope Jo'anna
Hope Jo'anna
Hope before the morning come
