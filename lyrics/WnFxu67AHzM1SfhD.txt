Burn me, take me to the fire
Heaven's hunting ground
Angels dancing in a wolf's lair
Never let me out

Let the play begin in dusk's embrace

I know there's something wrong in heaven
I've seen the devil sneak inside
To star the sweet intoxication
Blacken the light

It's like a black mass celebration
To twist the innocent and pure
Oh what a strange fascination
Please give me more

There's no retreat - from me
You will believe - in me
When we will light the pyre

Burn me, take me to the fire
Heaven's hunting ground
Angels dancing in a wolf's lair
Never let me out
Never let me out

Like waking up from a nightmare
It's all just feeling so surreal
But unknown powers force me back where
I can be free

I can finally be free and go

I've stolen the precious fruit forbidden, but so sweet

There's no retreat - for me
I will be lost - with you
Deep in this thunderstorm

Burn me, take me to the fire
Heaven's hunting ground
Angels dancing in a wolf's lair
Never let me out
Never let me out

Burn me, take me to the fire
Heaven's hunting ground
Angels dancing in a wolf's lair
Never let me out

Burn me, take me to the fire
Heaven's hunting ground
Angels dancing in a wolf's lair
Never let me out

Call me, drown me in your fire
All I want is you
Hear me say my last prayer
Never let me go
Never let me go
