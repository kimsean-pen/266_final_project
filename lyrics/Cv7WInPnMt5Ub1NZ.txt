Truth is sin
Truth is sin
Truth is sin
Truth is sin

Like sirens lure a sailor I'll suck and curry favour
A light identifies you, the culture crucifies you
I need a church of new restraints with stand up sins and fallen saints
I'll be the thorn right by your side
Your merciful and willing guide

This is the time you can dream
I'll tear apart your every seam
The shortest step is always down
To disappointment's stamping ground

The opium of the people shows the emperor in brand new clothes
The spitting spouting new decrees bind the chains to set you free
Here is the flame to torch your feast
The golden goose lands at your feet
The monster is unleashed

Truth is sin
Truth is sin
Truth is sin
Truth is sin

The burning bridges light your way, scar the path with tolls to pay
A golden life, a golden age in the shit filled golden cage
The upward struggles downward lies
The don't know what and the don't know why's
And the don't know why's
I'll be the new prescription mixer
I'm always there to fix ya
The bitter blows become the blessing
Always dressed to keep you guessing

The opium of the people shows the emperor in brand new clothes
The spitting spouting new decrees bind the chains to set you free
Here is the flame to torch your feast
The golden goose lands at your feet
The monster is unleashed

Truth is sin
Truth is sin
Truth is sin
Truth is sin
Truth is sin
Truth is sin
Truth is sin
Truth is sin
