Naysaying scum, betrayer of truth
You will never know "the truth" of your deceit
A scarecrow that burns itself down
Naysaying scum, you interloping infiltrators

Vice and virtue, the same for a naysayer
The scorning naysayer
The swarming naysayers
Quick to judge and run
A sadist on the prowl

The Icon grotesque, an eater of the dead
You feast on hope and world-weary flesh
On castaways, on masses dispossessed
You naysaying beast
Your vanity, an amulet of death

Vice and virtue, the same for a naysayer
The scorning naysayer
The swarming naysayers
Quick to judge and run
A sadist on the prowl

A petulant child inept and mired in punishment
You are the one that history will soon forget
Naysayer namenlos, like vermin swept from city streets
Agent-provocateur
As you speak under the sands of time
Your spew and spite and spit all reeks of servitude

Vice and virtue, the same for a naysayer
The scorning naysayer
The swarming naysayers
Quick to judge and run
A sadist on the prowl
