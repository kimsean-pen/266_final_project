Everything hanging on a string, diamond earrings
I can't even blink, I am at your door, let me in
For you, I cut my wings, throw the phone, cut the SIM
I'ma cut the oxygen, evil smoke rolling in
Delete my number baby, leave me like a dumpster baby
Treat me like trash cause that's all I am
I'll be your doll, play with me
Leave me in a box, forget me
You dress me up, but you don't pick me up

When I wake up I think about you
When I go to sleep, when I brush my teeth
I can't even breathe, can't even move
I can't even see, I can't even speak

I can't even breathe, I can't even see, I can't even speak

Everything hanging on a string, diamond earrings
I can't even blink, I am at your door, let me in
For you, I cut my wings, throw the phone, cut the sim
I'ma cut the oxygen, evil smoke rolling in
Delete my number baby, leave me like a dumpster baby
Treat me like trash cause that's all I am
I'll be your doll, play with me
Leave me in a box, forget me
You dress me up, but you don't pick me up
