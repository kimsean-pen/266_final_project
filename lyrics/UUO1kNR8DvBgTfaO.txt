Inside your voice resounds,
Your thoughts realign
Your words recall to mind
Your short sweet life

Hear voices all in time?)
Hear the words calling
Feel the wave form now, ride the foam,
See the world clearly now

Rising up you float outside yourself
Find the source of light
You fly home, you go closer now
Rising towards the light.
