Where have you gone?
You have become such a good friend.
Don't take too long.
To come back home.
Come back home.
Come back home.

All things end.
We can pretend that it doesn't hurt.
Anonymous space. Lacks grace.
And it would rather see you burn.

Where have you gone?
You have become such a good friend.
Don't take too long.
To come back home.
Come back home.
Come back home.
Come back home.
