With Rod Stewart

People get ready
There's a train a-coming
You don't need no baggage
You just get on board
All you need is faith
To hear the diesels humming
Don't need no ticket
You just thank the lord

People get ready
For the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers
From coast to coast
Faith is the key
Open the doors and board them
There's room for all
Among the loved the most
There ain't no room

There ain't no room
For the hopeless sinner
Who would harm mankind
Just to save his own
Have pity on those
Whose chances are thinner
Cause there's no hiding place
From the kingdom's throne

So people get ready
For the train a-comin
You don't need no baggage
You just get on board
All you need is faith
To hear the diesels humming
Don't need no ticket
You just thank, you just thank the lord

Yeah
Ooh

Yeah
Ooh

I'm getting ready
I'm getting ready
This time I'm ready
This time I'm ready
