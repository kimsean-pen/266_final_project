No switchback, no switchback
It's a broken failed interlock
No step out, no step out
I pick up my third interlock
No switchback, no switchback
It's a broken failed interlock
No break out, no way out
I look up straight to see crows

A stated line, a static wave
Feedbacks 'cause clash as I see
Scattering gift looks like trash
Should why do I keep it still?

Wasting, voiceless, cureless, it's a tiny risk
Chill out, it's near – I take it back
Look out, it's here – I take it down

I call up the fragments, killed and dead
I rebuild the meaningless lonely blood
