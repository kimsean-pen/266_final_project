There's so much that I would say
If I could see you one last time
But now I can't 'cause you're not here
But you're always on my mind
When I look up when you're not there
When I lie awake at night
All these things I ask myself
I don't why

When it's the first time
When it's the first time that you'll never see someone again
When it's the last time
When it's the last time when you weren't ready for it to end
When a light leaves you
When a light leaves you standing alone there in the dark
It's never easy
They're never easy but sometimes goodbyes are so hard
They're so hard

I look ahead but can't move on
I look back but I can't stay
And I keep trying to be strong
But there's pain, it won't go away
And I hope this will heal in time
'Cause I can't go on like this
And right now I would give my life
For one last kiss

When it's the first time
When it's the first time that you'll never see someone again
When it's the last time
When it's the last time when you weren't ready for it to end
When a light leaves you
When a light leaves you standing alone there in the dark
It's never easy
They're never easy but sometimes goodbyes are so hard

You'll be there on my mind
Standing in the sunshine
Oh oh oh

When it's the first time
Oh when it's the first time that you'll never see someone again
When it's the last time
Oh when it's the last time when you weren't ready for it to end, yeah
When a light leaves you
Oh when a light leaves you standing alone there in the dark
It's never easy
They're never easy but sometimes goodbyes are so hard
They're so hard
