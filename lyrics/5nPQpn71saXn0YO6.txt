Silent Militia!

Soon we will fly
All these fears collide

Say you wanna feel it? ...you better step up
So you wanna be it? ...you are a piece of me
Feel it? ... you'll wanna step up.
All you are is all that is me, and I will say it again:

SILENT MILITIA

All for the thrill of the kill of...
The world's only haunted sacred now

Do you believe we'll make it alright?
Whoa yeah!
If we believe, will we make it alright?
Whoa yeah!

Do you think we should?
Would you if you could?

So you wanna feel it? ...you better step up
So you wanna be it? ...you are a piece of me
Feel it? ... you'll wanna step up.
All you are is all that is me, and I will say it again:

All for the thrill of the kill of
The world's oldest haunted sacred cow

Do you believe we'll make it alright?
Whoa yeah!
If we believe, will we make it alright?
Whoa yeah!

Will you feel alright, will you feel alright will you feel alright when you're gone?
Will you feel alright, will you be alright will you feel alright when you're gone?

Fire away! Fire away! Fire away! Fire away!
