Hello? Yeah bitch, I said I'm on my way
Hello? Yeah bitch, I said I'm on my way
The fuck? Bitch I'm coming the fuck?
Woah! Kenny! Yeah!

I'm the bitch with the long hair and her top off
Talk tough, like a bottle top, we twist your top off
Had to hit the turn quick, just to get the narcs off
I'm the real deal shawty and you just the knock off
Shake it up, no Coca-Cola, I'm the one that pop off
Hit me on my Motorola if you need some narcos
I've been working every day, no, I ain't never call off
Talking shit on Instagram, that pistol make you log off
It's upsetting that these bitches think they better than me
I got the bar too high and it's hard to beat
Gucci shades tint dark so it's hard to see
The easy part is getting money but it's hard to keep
I know you seeing that I'm busy so don't bother me
Like I passed every test, you ain't as smart as me
You a stunt double, shawty, you a wanna be
See me on the scene, you know that I charged the fee
Like yeah!

What? What? What? What? What? What?
Bitches on my dick, so what?
What? What? What? What? What? What?
It don't matter 'cause I'm steady counting up
What? What? What? What? What? What?
Bitches on my dick, so what?
What? What? What? What? What? What?
It don't matter 'cause I'm steady counting up

You can't even handle a bitch like me
Make my own money, and I buy my own weed
Touch my wrist and your hand gon' freeze
Begging for the kitty on his hands and knees
Who you fronting on?
Come on girl, I know you a rookie
You got some followers, so what? Do you want you a cookie?
I got promoters throwing shows so they can say that they booked me
When I walk up in the mall, they be turning and looking
No race, I went easy 'cause the pace I been pushing
In the stew, I'm like a chef, they like, Rico, what you cooking?
Probably one of these bitches' heads, I'm better than all the rest
No this is not a drill, hoe, this shit is not a test
I think you need to roll out, catch you actin' too hesitant
I bet you can't count all the money that I just spent
Niggas singing to the feds like they Jazmine Sullivan
My racks too big, I just popped my rubber band

What? What? What? What? What? What?
Bitches on my dick, so what?
What? What? What? What? What? What?
It don't matter 'cause I'm steady counting up
What? What? What? What? What? What?
Bitches on my dick, so what?
What? What? What? What? What? What?
It don't matter 'cause I'm steady counting up
