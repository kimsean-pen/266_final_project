Walkin' 'round and I don't know why
For the hell of it
If you want to cry and you don't know why
For the hell of it
Don't know why, if you feel so high
It's the smell of it
Sing that sound, rhythm and the melody

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Feels like I'm an animal
Feels like I'm an animal

Sing that sound, rhythm and the melody
Sing that sound, rhythm and the melody
Sing that sound, rhythm and the melody
Sing that sound, rhythm and the melody

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Feels like I'm an animal
Feels like I'm an animal
Feels like I'm an animal
Feels like I'm an animal

Feels like I'm an animal
Feels like I'm an animal
Feels like I'm an animal
Feels like I'm an animal

Walkin' 'round and I don't know why
For the hell of it
If you want to cry and you don't know why
For the hell of it
Don't know why, if you feel so high
It's the smell of it
Sing that sound, rhythm and the melody
