I took a car to your place
I wanted to see your face
And you're calling me names
I slept, I slept in too late
Burned my tongue, missed the train
All because of that look you gave

My sister says I should give up
My friends say you're not good enough
And now I'm seeing right through you
I'm seeing what they never saw in you

Tell me are you even in it
'Cause I'm done trying in a minute
And just like that, just like that
There's nothing left of
You can come get all your t-shirts
'Cause I don't like the way I look in them
And just like that, just like that
There's nothing left of you
Nothing left of you

I think you love when we fight
So you feel something inside
What a depressing sight
Maybe you love me if I
Had more money to buy
All the shit that you think you'd like

Your sister says I should give up
Your friends say you're not good enough
And now I'm seeing right through you
I'm seeing what they never saw in you

Tell me are you even in it
'Cause I'm done trying in a minute
And just like that, just like that
There's nothing left of
You can come get all your t-shirts
'Cause I don't like the way I look in them
And just like that, just like that
There's nothing left of you
Nothing left of you

I don't know what you're thinking
I don't know what you want from me
You keep it all in, I can disappear
(Just like that, just like that)
I don't know what you're thinking
I don't know what you want from me
You keep it up, I'm gonna disappear
(Just like that, just like that)

Tell me are you even in it
'Cause I'm done trying in a minute
And just like that, just like that
There's nothing left of
You can come get all your t-shirts
'Cause I don't like the way I look in them
And just like that, just like that
There's nothing left of you

I'm gonna disappear
Keep it up and I can disappear
There's nothing left of you
Nothing left of me
I'm gonna disappear, oh oh oh oh
There's nothing left of you
