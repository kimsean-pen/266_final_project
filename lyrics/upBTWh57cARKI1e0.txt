Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Coming up slowly, our sun out of the hill
Daylight's still a longtime coming, but I know it will

Been out of this spell, oh, but we're coming away
So we'll be rude, we'll be loud
As long as it takes
This is why, this is why

We crank the dial to the right
Oh, this is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
(Sing!)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Different colors
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We carry each other
Ooh, ooh, ooh

We're just different colors
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
We keep cranking the music up
driving through our town
But they don't wanna hear
They want us to turn it down
So come on lovers
Come on haters

Tonight we raise a fire
'Cause when the people get to dancin'
They forget about taking sides
This is why, this is why

We crank the dial to the right
Oh, this is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
(Sing!)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Different colors
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We carry each other
Ooh, ooh, ooh

We're just different colors
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
We're coming away

Out of your spell
As long as it takes
We're coming away
We're coming away

Out of your spell
As long as it takes
We're coming away
This is why, this is why
We crank the dial to the right
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
I said, this is why, this is why

We turn it up all night
Oh, this is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Different colors
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We carry each other
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We're just different colors
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
Different colors
We carry each other
(Oh yeah)
We're just different colors
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
