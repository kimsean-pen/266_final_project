I remember...
The way you glanced at me, yes I remember
I remember...
When we caught a shooting star, yes I remember
I remember...
All the things that we shared, and the promise we made, just you and I
I remember...
All the laughter we shared, all the wishes we made, upon the roof at dawn
Do you remember...?
When we were dancing in the rain in that december
And I remember...
When my father thought you were a burglar
I remember...
All the things that we shared, and the promise we made, just you and I
I remember...
All the laughter we shared, all the wishes we made, upon the roof at dawn
Yes I remember
All the things that we shared, and the promise we made, just you and I
I remember...
All the laughter we shared, all the wishes we made, upon the roof at dawn
I remember...
The way you read your books
Yes I remember
The way you tied your shoes
Yes I remember
The cake you loved the most
Yes I remember
The way you drank you coffee
I remember
The way you glanced at me
Yes I remember
When we caught a shooting star
Yes I remember
When we were dancing in the rain in that december
And the way you smile at me
Yes I remember
