She stopped me in the doorway
She kissed me on the lips
I don't even know her
That's just the way it is
Then she touched my hand
Told me I should be her man
T-t-to show her how to dance
This is my one and only chance
And that's just romance

No I don't want to be
The guy to see you go
And I don't wanna leave
If you don't take me home
I don't want see
You walk away from me
I got everything
That you could ever need
No I don't want to be
The guy to see you go

Now I'm seein double
I'm leaning on pool cue
I'm aiming for that black ball
Cause tonight there ain't no last call

Pour me pitcher of the cheap stuff
To chase the taste of these cheap shots
Turn it up on the jukebox
I don't wanna have to talk

No I don't want to be
The guy to see you go
And I don't wanna leave
If you don't take me home
I don't want see
You walk away from me
I got everything
That you could ever need
No I don't want to be
The guy to see you go

Cause I don't want to see you leave
I grab my coat and you grab your keys
We're all alone I find you lips
Take me home for a goodnight kiss
Cause I don't want to see you leave
I grab my coat and you grab your keys
We're all alone I find you lips
Take me home for a goodnight kiss

No I don't want to be
The guy to see you go
And I don't wanna leave
If you don't take me home
I don't want see
You walk away from me
I got everything
That you could ever need
No I don't want to be
The guy to see you go
Go go go go
