I will light the match this mornin'
So I won't be alone
Watch as she lies silent
For soon night will be gone

Oh, I will stand arms outstretched
Pretend I'm free to roam
I will make my way
Through, one more day in hell

How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?

I will hold the candle
'Til it burns up my arm
Oh, I'll keep takin' punches
Until their will grows tired

Oh, I will stare the sun down
Until my eyes go blind
Hey, I won't change direction
And I won't change my mind

How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?

I'll swallow poison
Until I grow immune
I will scream my lungs out
Till it fills this room

How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?
