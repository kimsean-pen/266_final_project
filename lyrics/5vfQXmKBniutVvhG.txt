Say, whatever you might say
Will never ever hurt a man
Who truly faced death

Embrace, it's nothing more than waste
If lifetime is for playing my friend
Get better at the game

Man, it's all a shame
Don't pity-look me when I'm not empty handed like you

Got to pay your debt before this story fades away
'R치 dara r치', hard is brightening the past
Better lie and leave behind, tomorrow looks so clear
'R치 dara r치', if you're sorry I forgive you

Dance, we're called "The Deadmen"
No matter how deep we are
We'll see the sun again
