Often I am upset
That I cannot fall in love
But I guess
This avoids the stress of falling out of it

Are you tired of me yet?
I'm a little sick right now
But I swear
When i'm ready I will fly us out of here

I'll cut my hair

To make you stare

I'll hide my chest
And i'll figure out a way to get us out of here.

Turn off your porcelain face
I can't really think right now in this place
There's too many colors
Enough to drive all of us insane

Are you dead?
Sometimes I think I'm dead
Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head
But i don't wanna fall asleep just yet

My eyes went dark

I don't know where

My pupils are
But i'll figure out a way to get us out of here

Get a load of this monster
He doesn't know how to communicate
His mind is in a different place
Will everybody please give him a little bit of space

Get a load of this trainwreck
His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet
But little do we know the stars welcome him with open arms

Oh

Time is

Slowly

Tracing his face
But strangely he feels at home in this place.
