I, I been gone, I been gone too long, singin' my songs, on the road
Another town, one more show, and I'm comin' home
Don't give a damn what these keys are for
I'm gonna knock down that front door, and

I'ma gonna find out what that house is made of
It's been too many nights since its felt us make love
I wanna rock some sheetrock, knock some pictures off the wall
Love you baby, like a wrecking ball

You, look at you, send me one more shot, sittin' on a bathroom sink
Damn you, really turn me on, paintin' your toenails pink
Easy baby before you say, but if I can make it just one more day, and

That old house is gonna be shakin'
I hope those bricks and boards can take it
But I won't be surprised if the whole damn place just falls
I'm gonna rock you baby, like a wrecking ball

And that old house is gonna be shaking
Rafter and rockin' foundation quaking
Crash out through the front door, back you up against the wall
Love you baby, take it right there baby
Rock you baby, like a wrecking ball
