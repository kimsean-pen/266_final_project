Be careful
Boy
I'm not your toy.
But if you play it right
we'll have lots of joy.
You are ok but let me say
That ev'rybody lives in a different way.
Falling in love's alright

But not for just one night
only one night.
In for a penny
in for a pound.
You should never jump off the merry-go-round
In for a penny
in for a pound.
If you start to play
do not walk away.
When you are pennywise

You'll never win the highest prize.

If you love me
then wait and see.
I keep my little heart under lock and key
Until I know our love will grow.
And then you can be sure that I won't say "no
Fallin in love's alright

But not for just one night
only one night.
In for a penny
in for a pound. . . .
In for a penny
in for a pound. . . .
In for a penny
in for a pound. . . .
