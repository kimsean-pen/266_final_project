Just one look into your eyes
One look and I'm crying
'Cause you're so beautiful
Just one kiss and I'm alive
One kiss and I'm ready to die
'Cause you're so beautiful, yeah

Just one touch and I'm on fire
One touch and I'm crying
'Cause you're so beautiful
Just one smile and I'm wild
One smile and I'm ready to die
'Cause you're so beautiful, yeah

Oh, and you're so beautiful, my darling
Oh, you're so beautiful
You're so beautiful, oh my baby
You're so beautiful
And you're so beautiful, yeah
Oh my darling, oh my baby
And you're so beautiful
