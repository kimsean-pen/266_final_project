I can get up
On the right side of the bed
But that won't stop the rain
From coming down on my head
I can live my life
Playing hide and seek
But when I look inside
It's hard to make believe

But lately
You seem so far away
I wish I could say something
But I don't know what to say
I can feel your eyes
I don't have to look at you
Boy, discontentment
Is a sneakin' through

You never really want anything
But what you really need is everything
I'll give you something only life can bring
The calm inside the storm
Love me a little, love me now.
Wo, yeah
The calm inside the storm
Love me a little, love me now.

Don't you know?
You should be holding me
But you're all locked inside
Why don't you throw me your keys?
I'm like a rockin' ship
On your rollin' sea
You know crash down the lightnin'
Never frightens me, nah, nah

You never really want anything
But what you really need is everything
I'll give you something only life can bring
The calm inside the storm
Love me a little, love me now.
Wo, yeah
The calm inside the storm
Love me a little, love me now.

You never really wanted
But you really needed
I wanna give you something

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You never really want anything
But what you really need is everything
I'll give you something only life can bring
The calm inside the storm
Love me a little, love me now

But what you really need is everything
I'll give you somethin' only life can bring
The calm inside the storm
Love me a little, love me now.
The calm inside the storm
Love me a little, love me now
The calm inside the storm
Love me a little, love me now.
