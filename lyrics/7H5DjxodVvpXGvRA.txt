"...I am the light that shall lead you to darkness..."

Well, here I am, I'm back again
From the Deadlands I descend...
back from the dead, back from The End
...I'm here to take Revenge!

Soon the deathly dusk will fall
and the Night I've waited for
...at the dawn you'll live no more

Breathing through Death... Living for Bloodshed...

I'm the Suicider dying every night and day
Killing me is not enough to make me go away

I live to kill and kill to live
And long for dying endlessly
Each time I kill I'm born again
...I have become The End

Thus I am and thus I'll die
yet another thousand times
...I am dead and I am alive

Take a deep breath...
It's the last one you will get!

I'm the Suicider dying every night and day
Killing me is not enough to make me go away
I'm the Suicider seeking for the End of Life
(But) killing me is not enough to cease the flame inside

...Thus I kill and thus I'll die...
Thus I will live for all time
