It's time to be born again, don't talk about sex, that's a sin
Confess your evils to the man, he'll do everything he can
Don't go mass, you'll go to Hell, we'll all be there, it'll be swell

Ruling your lives with such lies
You won't survive

We're being sucked up into the vacuum culture
This way, this way, it's too late, you're addicted
Come on, control yourself, snatch that bottle off the shelf
You're trapped now with spiritual law, spiritual law

Fiddle with your rosaries, holy water makes me bleed
Attach that cross to to my head, it may burn, but it won't be dead

Go burn your rosaries, go burn it all
Death to us all

It is time to congregate the mindless sheep, don't be late
You'll be slammed, you'll be mould, you'll be thrown into the walls
Everbody think it's cool tanning outside your daddy's pool
I think it's way too late, time to degenerate

You heard impressions, unite
It's not too late, it's not too late
You heard impressions, unite
There's one chance left, get on your knees, drink the wine, chew the wafer

People screaming, "Can I be dreaming?
Is this the truth? I can't tell
Whether this is Heaven or Hell"
Wolfbane and the sound of a silver bell

The air is thick, the smell of death is everywhere
It's all around
But I won't submit to death
You can go with the-

Mental lie, why did they cry?
Mental lie, why did they cry?
Mental lie, why did they cry?

Ruling your lives with such lies
You won't survive

It is time to congregate the mindless sheep, don't be late
You'll be slammed, you'll be mould, you'll be thrown into the walls
Everbody think it's cool tanning outside your daddy's pool
I think it's way too late, time to degenerate

You heard impressions, unite
It's not too late, it's not too late
You heard impressions, unite
It's not too late, it's not too late
