Atmospheres they throw a little storm
Motions aren't emotional
Good morning I threw as if my welcome

Atmospheres they throw a little storm
Motions aren't emotional
Good morning I threw as if my welcome

(Smiling face)
Atmospheres they throw a little storm
(We all love)
Motions aren't emotional
(Hay)
Good morning I threw as if my welcome
(Aah)

(Darling skies)
Atmospheres they throw a little storm
(What's in that's)
Motions aren't emotional
(My)
Good morning I threw as if my welcome
(Secrets)

Atmospheres they throw a little storm
Motions aren't emotional
Good morning I threw as if my welcome

Atmospheres they throw a little storm
Motions aren't emotional
Good morning I threw as if my welcome

Where is all this, as I float out of
It's the news, ooh
Okay, floating away
Bask on rays, sing out all day
