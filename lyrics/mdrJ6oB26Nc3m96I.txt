Away, away, away I go
See me taking up in a hot air balloon
Away, away from you
There ain't no room for two
'Cause baby all I needed is time
Time out

Away, away, away I go
See me flying in my spaceship to the moon
Away, away from you
Singing to my own tune
'Cause baby all I needed is time
Time out

Time out
Time out
Time out
Time out
