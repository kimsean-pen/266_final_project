Somebody if anybody
Someone told you
That I've been hanging out
Cheating at night
Someone if anybody
Should get that story right
Tell them they need to go get a life
'Cause I don't need someone
Checking up on me
Watching my every move in sight
And you don't need those
Kind of worries
To be messin' your
Messin' your mind

Girl you know that I'm
Not that kind of guy
And you need to just ask yourself why
Would I waste my time
To commit such a crime
Lose the best thing
I have in my life

Someone's trying to come between me
and you
Can't you see what they're trying to do
They can't stand to see something so right
See two people so satisfied

Somebody if anybody, someone told me
That when you go out they say you're
So nice
Somebody, nobody had to tell me
That you danced and talked with lots
Of guys
And I don't know why they feel
The need to let me know that you've
Had a good time
Maybe they thought that I would
Get jealous get upset with you
And start a fight

But they don't understand that the
Love we have is much stronger
Than they can conceive
There's no jealousy, there's no need
To be, 'cause my lady only lays
Down with me

See I'm down with this girl, she's my
Whole wide world and she's down
With her man, they don't seem to
Understand
We've got a love that's honest and true.
No one will ever come between us two
And everybody so confused, but it ain't
Nobody's business what we do

Chorus
