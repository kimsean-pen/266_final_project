Boy you and I should hide away
As far as love will let us stray
We will dance for ever and a day
Be together for eternity

We shall bloom in our spring affair
Steal a kiss beneath the golden moon
Run hand in hand without a care
And flourish in the summer sun

I love you

Autumn's breeze blows gently
through your hair
To you I give my heart completely
And as winter days grow dark and cold
I'll keep warm in the glow of your love

I love you, yes I do
I love you, yes I do
I love you
I love you
