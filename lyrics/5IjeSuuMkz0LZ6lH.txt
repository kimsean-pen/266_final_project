You keep troubles in your mind.
And you keep them there all the time.
And you won't share them apart,
'cause of your broken heart, you keep losing your time.
You keep losing your time.

Hope is a pearl that your share.
You share it all the time with people all around.
And, you can't seem to find time
But, you can't seem to find time
And you loose it all the time.
You can't keep tracking your time.
You loose it. All the time.
You loose it all the time.
You loose it all the time, the track of time.

Hope is a pearl that I share. I share it with you.
It's a pearl that I share.
I share it with you, all the time.
I share it with you, all the time.
So I loose my track of time.
I can't keep tracking my time.
I loose it. All the time
I loose it all the time
I loose it all the time
I loose it all the time, the track of time.
