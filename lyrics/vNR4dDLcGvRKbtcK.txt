(J. Nordavind '94)

Whipped and pierced,
you disbehave.
Underneath the whip
to soothe the beast

Burn a candle from my soul,
for I will never do the same.
Cause I see beauty in another things
and that is light is the wilderness alone.

Kneel before me
and shine my shoes.
I give you much
but you want more

I am the long arm of unforgivingness.
Beholder of all chains.
This tool of great destruction.
This life of feces and filth.

Pick up your teeth with broken fingers.
Lick the blood of your cracked lips.
The colour purple seems to fit you
Bow down...
