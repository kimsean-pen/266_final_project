(Right, I'm gonna do this real
quiet 'cause I think you're sleeping...)
In there we stood
Bled into something good
A love for me easily infected by Fireworks and Cinnamon Gum

Around that wall
I promised you wouldn't fall
Flip my lid, got me kid,
Fall you did
But I intend to catch you soft
So lay into my arms

In there we stood
Bled into something good
Streetlight short-sight
Couldn't foresee it would
A love for me easily infected by Fireworks and Cinnamon Gum
So lay into my arms

Around the wall
Promised you wouldn't fall
Close my eyes and
I can still feel it all
Flip my lid
Got me kid
Fall you did
But I intend to catch you soft
So lay into my arms
