I want to start again
Sunsets new babbling man
Holding my sign
Manhattan on the rocks
Red handed never caught
But hoping you'll try
Mine is a chrome palace
Lost in Los Angeles
I know that I'll make it trough
oooh
I want to start again
My crime fits the punishment
Wasting my time
Remember at the board laura throwing darts
You're holding it together while you torn apart
Forcing a smile
Mine is a chrome palace
Lost in Los Angeles
I know that I'll make it trough
oooh
Mine is a chrome palace
Islands and old ballads
Shinning like brand new
oooh
It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust
Step out into the sun
Take a moment for your eyes to adjust
It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust
Step out into the sun
oh oh
oooh
I want to start again
Sunsets new babbling man
Holding my sign
Manhattan on the rocks
Red handed never caught
But hoping you'll try
