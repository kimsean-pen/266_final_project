Sensitive
It's true
Alligator tears
Cried over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you

Run around on me
Sooner die without
Run around on me
Die without

Relentless
Yes, it's true
My motor mouth
Runs over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you

Run around on me
Sooner die without
Run around on me
Die without

Over you, over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you

Run around on me
Sooner die without
Run around on me
Die without

No hissy fits
Mind my manners
Won't make a scene

Oh, Over you
Over you, over you
Over you
Over you, over you

Run around on me
Sooner die without
Run around on me
Die without

Rattled yes, it's true
Alligator tears
Spilled over you

(2x)
Run around on me
Sooner die without
Run around on me
Die without

Over you, over you
Over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you
Over you
Over you, over you
Over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you
