Fire has left Väinölä's hearth stones
Light has gone
Dark nights no light under the sky
Hard to find the Fire-child

Eagle of fire with fiery feathers
Made a spark
Ukko made the Kokko's spark
Kindle as a fire

Fly into the night bring back the light
That left the hearth stones
Find the light Eagle of fire
Fly through skies, let there be light!

Dark skies ablazed with fire when
Kokko flew across the heavens
After the child, the child of fire
floating through the vaults of ether.

Ether maidens cradled the fire child
In starry skies
Slipped through the hands of lady Ether
Escaped from silver cradle

Low descends the dome of heaven
Upon, under
On the edge of the ether
the clouds of Northland thunder

Fly into the night bring back the light
That left the hearth stones
Find the light Eagle of fire
Fly through skies, let there be light!

Dark skies ablazed with fire when
Kokko flew across the heavens
After the child, the child of fire
floating through the vaults of ether.
