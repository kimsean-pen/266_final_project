I had a feeling once
That you and I
Could tell each other everything
For two months

But even with an oath
With truth on our side
When you turn away from me
It's not right

I think you're a contra
I think you're a contra
I think you're a contra
I think you're a contra

My revolution thoughts
Your little lies of desire
I want to trace them to the source
And the wire

But it's not useful now
Since we both made up our minds
Your gonna watch out for yourself
And so will I

I think you're a contra
I think that you lie
Don't call me a contra
Till you've tried

You wanted good schools
And friends with pools
You're not a contra

You wanted rock and roll
Complete control
Well, I don't know

Never pick sides
Never choose between two
But I just wanted you
I just wanted you
Said never pick sides
Never choose between two
But I just wanted you
I just wanted you
I think you're a contra
I think that you lie
Don't call me a contra
Till you've tried
