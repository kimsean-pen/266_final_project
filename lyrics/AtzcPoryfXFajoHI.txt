I wish that summer never would let go
I wish that winter never got its grip on my lost soul

My home is where the summer dies
A winter land beneath the darkened skies
The summer sun is on the wane again
Embrace my heart, embrace my soul
Your touch is heaven sent

I wish that summer never would let go
I wish that winter never got its grip on my lost soul
I wish you'd be forever by my side
And lead me through the falling devastating eventide

My heart lies where the darkness falls
It's buried deep beneath the forest floor
The silver eye shines on as snow descends
My summer sun, you're long since gone
I'll wait for you until the bitter end

I wish that summer never would let go
I wish that winter never got its grip on my lost soul
I wish you'd be forever by my side
And lead me through the falling devastating eventide

I wish that summer never would let go
I wish that winter never got its grip on my lost soul
I wish you'd be forever by my side
And lead me through the falling devastating eventide
