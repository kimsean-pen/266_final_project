You have what they don't
Your heart is true
So dry your tears
And let it shine through
'Cause you're amazing
Look at you smiling
And don't change anything
There's no denying

You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Don't ever listen to what they say about you
You're perfect just the way you are
You will never be anything like them
And the strength is in your heart, whoa oh, you heart
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're perfect just the way you are
You're beautiful
You're beautiful

Don't put yourself down
Don't let them win
(Don't let them win)
They don't understand
Who you are
(Who you are)

'Cause you're amazing
Look at you smiling
And don't change anything
There's no denying

You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Don't ever listen to what they say about you
You're perfect just the way you are
You will never be anything like them
And the strength is in your heart, whoa oh, you heart
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're perfect just the way you are

Breakdown your walls, whoa oh
You can be the person you wanna be
Break down your walls, whoa oh
Become who you are

You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Don't ever listen to what they say about you
You're perfect just the way you are
You will never be anything like them
And the strength is in your heart, whoa oh, you heart
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're perfect just the way you are
