Silence
Silence could be the best conversation
Cause baby I've been thinking about it so much about that lately
My lady, I'm on my knees
Can you, please, tell me where I need to be

Cause I'm lost, I'm lost without you
I'm lost, I'm lost without you
I'm lost, I'm lost without you

Inner peace
You should come and show me what it means to yell
Possession
A livelihood of you keeping all you need for ya
My lady, I care for you so loosely
So show me where I need to be

Cause I'm lost, I'm lost without you
I'm lost, I'm lost without you
I'm lost, I'm lost without you

It's love, love, love
Oh it's love, love, love (oeh yeah)
It's love, love, love
Oh It's love, love, love (oeh yeah)

Lost without you
Lost without you
Lost without you
Lost
(lost, lost, lost)
Lost without you
Lost without you
It's love, love, love
Oh it's love, love, love
