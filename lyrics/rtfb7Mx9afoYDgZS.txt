My heart isn't big enough.
No more
And I start to wonder what I saw in you
Cause we've gone too far
Iv'e forgotten who you are
Too much
Enoughs enough
I'm over you
My heart isn't big enough
No more
And I start to wonder what I saw in you
Cause we've gone too far
I've forgotten who you are
Too Much
Enoughs enough I'm over you
And if you ask me what I wanted
Could I lie with a smile?
And if you ask me to believe it.
Maybe I could for awhile.
And if you ask me what I wanted

You go ahead and make believe

that we could smile and pretend
but I only want to be happy
and we have come to the end

Too much. Enoughs enough. I'm over you

No More.
My heart isnt big enough.
No more.
My heart isn't big enough
