Now that it's all said and done
I can't believe you were the one
To build me up and tear me down
Like an old abandoned house
And what you said when you left
Just left me cold and out of breath
I fell too far, was in way too deep
Guess I let you get the best of me

Well, I never saw it coming
I should've started running
a long long time ago
And I never thought to doubt you, I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure, I guess it's really over
I'm finally getting better
And now I'm picking up the pieces and spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together 'cause
the day I thought I'd never get through
I got over you
You took a hammer to these walls
Dragged the memories down the hall
Packed your bags and walked away
There was nothing I could say
And when you slammed the front door shut

A lot of others opened up, so did my eyes, so I could see

That you never were the best for me
Well, I never saw it coming
I should've started running a long long time ago
And I never thought to doubt you, I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure,
I guess it's really over I'm finally getting better

Now, I'm picking up the pieces and spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together 'cause
the day I thought I'd never get through

I got over you
Well, I never saw it coming
I should've started running a long long time ago
And I never thought to doubt you
I'm better off without you, more than you, more than you know
Well, I never saw it coming
I should've started running a long long time ago
And I never thought to doubt you
I'm better off without you, more than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure
I guess it's really over, I'm finally getting better

Now, I'm picking up the pieces and spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together
I'm putting my heart back together
'Cause I got over you
'Cause I got over you
I got over you
'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through
I got over you
