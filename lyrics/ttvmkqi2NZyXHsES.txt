Oh me oh my
I'm running out of batteries
I'm hanging from the ladder
the tears you cried
are only meant to flatter me
that shit don't matter all

Taking the shots as I fall
Watching the wheels that go round and round
Serene in the air
'cause I love you lady
I dream on,
Oooh
Cause that songbird singing

Shout it for me
Shout it for me
So come on now

One day at a time
I'm hiding from the razor blade
that's hanging in the kitchen

The kids are tired
They drunk up all their lemonade
The bitch keeps bitching and all

Taking the shots as I fall
Wait for the wheels to come round and round
Serene in the air
Cause I love you lady
I Dream On
Oooh

Cause that songbird singing
Shout it for me Oooh

Dream on
Oooh
Cause it's got no meaning

Shout it for me She go
lalalalala

Dream on
Oooh
Cause that songbird singing
Shout it out for me Dream On
Oooh
Cause it's got no meaning

Shout it out for me
Shout it for me (come on)
