Hey Karen
Make a decision
Is it wrong to go through the misfortune I do
Well I got a feeling
It's gonna work out fine, don't be blue, oh no
I feel like I'm losing my mind
Where at least she'd go in her mind at the end of today
I look in your eyes

Karen you're the one I've been looking for
Listen to the fears today
Got to be the man you want me to
No more lies, no more tricks, no more fits, no more lies
Baby you're mine

Hey Karen
There is a reason
That I come back time after time for you
I fantasize
Sometimes I get lost in your eyes, and it's true
I've lost for you
When I look deep inside your mind
I've got to go, thinking about

Karen you're the one I've been looking for
I can't see the mist in your eyes
Sun's just been boring since you've been gone
No more tricks, no more flings, no more lies
I'll see us, Karen
Make a decision
No more tricks, no more flings, no more lies
