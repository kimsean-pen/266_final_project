I'm the setting sun behind the trees
The saddest one you've seen
I've been burning holes
And breaking dreams, and I regret it

I'm fixing things I've broken
It's not as easy as it used to be
I'm throwing temper tantrums
I used to settle, but now I make a scene

You can't believe

I said I'd never walk away but I'm not able to stay
I said I'd never leave this place but I can't stay here
To watch you fade and watch you change
Into someone I can't face, I can't replace, I can't replace you

You're the swirling wind above the sea
The maddest storm they've seen
Now you're breaking waves and smashing dreams
And you can't help it

You're drowning streets and stranding a million people
You're starting out with me
You're crashing down from anger, your stuff is settled
And now you're sound asleep

And so serene

I said I'd never walk away but I'm not able to stay
I said I'd never leave this place but I can't stay here
To watch you fade and watch you change
Into someone I can't face, I can't replace, I can't replace you

And when the sun is down, and when the skies are calm
You'll see, calm will be
We'll wait for the cycle, we'll repeat our same mistakes
Same mistakes we've always made

I said I'd never walk away, but I'm not able to stay
I said I'd never leave this place, but I can't stay here
To watch you fade and watch you change
Into someone I can't face, I can't replace, I can't replace you
I said I'd never walk away, but I'm not able to stay
I said I'd never leave this place, but I can't stay here
To watch you fade and watch you change
Into someone I can't face, I can't replace, I can't replace you
I said I'd never walk away
