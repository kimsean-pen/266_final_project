I think about it often and
All the ways it didn't go as planned
But with some time
I finally understand

I was better off alone
Instead of staying up
Waiting by the phone
In my mind I though I had you
All to myself falling in

When we met I was left for dead
Still bleeding, left for dead
You brought me back to life
Only to bruise me up again
Alright

So I'm staying in (Man)
With wounds on the mend
I'll find a way to write it off
And start over when

I get left for dead
Forever left for dead
Still hoping someone finds me
Somehow somewhere in the end
Alright

I can't blame you for it all
Hope you find what makes you hole
I tried to get it right
And if you learn from this at all
The way to kill is making sure
That I'm gone

And never coming back alive
You better watch me die
Now you know
You better watch me die
