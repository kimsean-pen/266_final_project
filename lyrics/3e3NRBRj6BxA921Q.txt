I woke up in a hole!

I spent the night digging my grave
Dirt nap atrophy
Zombie life magazine
Front page headline
Reads "Suicide pipe dreams"
Force fed a life I refuse
Swimming neck deep in dirt
I will choose how I lose

Dying means I don't need anything
Fucking refuse

(Lie to me) Give me your word it's safe
(Lie to me) So I can hear the fake
(Lie to me) Give me your word it's safe
(Lie to me) So I can dig my grave

Force fed a life I refuse
Under a lightning filled sky
I will choose

At the end of the day hang me up so
high that the angels play with my hair
Bury me so low
That the life I loathe
Dissipates and slips away

Hang me high
Bury me low

(Lie to me) Give me your word it's safe
(Lie to me) So I can dig my grave

At the end of the day hang me high
Under thunder and lightning filled skies
Then bury me low
So no angels die
For the life I loathe

Run your dreams into the ground

In life
Gods and slaves
As above so below
I'll rule 'til kingdom come
Silence the apostle's song

Erase the words
Submit to truth
Lift the veil
See the light
No more compromise
For the fragile masses who choose to oblige

In life
Gods and slaves
As above so below
I'll shine 'til kingdom come
Silence the apostle's song

Strike them down
Strike them down
Hole in your head means they do not decide
Stop them now

Strike them down
To lift them up
Hole in your head means they do not decide

Strike them down

Cut roots and run wild; child be free

Victory
Will be mine
We will pull the thorn from our side and send them to hell

Strike them down
Hole in your head means they do not decide
Lift the veil to see the light
Gods and slaves
