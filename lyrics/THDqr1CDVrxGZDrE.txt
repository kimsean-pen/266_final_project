The more I fight the day
The more it drags on
And no blues can sing it away
I just got to press on

The more you talk to me, baby
The more I cry
Just leave me, quickly save me
From the darkness you provide

It's just too hard
It's just too hard to deal with
It's just too much
It's just too much to deal with
I had enough
So hang up on my call

Let me be, let me breathe
Let me get control of my focus
I ain't dig this feeling no more
Please don't make me love you no more

Let me be, let me breathe
Let me get me out from under
I ain't dig this feeling no more
Please don't make me love you no more
Don't make me love you
Like I love you now, please

You swore you loved me forever
But you rather stay away
You promised we'd be together
Are you expecting me to wait

For an imaginary day
To come and fix this pain
Baby I know what you're doing
And it's a shameful game to play
Who exactly do you think I am
You're not gonna wipe your feet on me
Just tell me straight
Let there be no mistaking

It's just too hard
It's just too hard to deal with
It's just too much
It's just too much to deal with
I had enough
So hang up on my call

Let me be, let me breathe
Let me get control of my focus
I ain't dig this feeling no more
Please don't make me love you no more

Let me be, let me breathe
Let me get me out from under
I ain't dig this feeling no more
Please don't make me love you no more
Don't make me
Don't make me love you
Like I love you now

Oh, woah oh
Ooh, ooh, oh
You know that I don't feel right without you
And your kinda light
Without you I'm falling back into my love
Whenever you feel like
Lay down, in the shadows I can make out
Just a tink of life
But the window's just too high
Freedom is asking me why I can't make the flight
Why can't I make it?
Why you're holding on?
Why you're holding on to me?

Let me be, let me breathe
Let me get control of my focus
I ain't dig this feeling no more
Please don't make me love you no more

Let me be, let me breathe
Let me get me out from under
I ain't dig this feeling no more
Please don't make me love you no more
You gotta let me go now
Let me move on
Let me be, let me breathe you
