I don't understand
You're walking all over me
All over me to you

You must be mad
And you know you are
You should have known
I'd do anything for you

So, why?
Why can't we come together?
Why?

Why?
Why can't we come together?
Why?

Inside my head
There's nothing left
It's all been taken out by you

And do I care
Well, you know I do
You should have known
I'd do anything for you

So, why?
Why can't we come together?
Why?

Why?
Why can't we come together?
Why?

Now it's all been said
And you know it all
Then you should have known
I'd do anything for you

For you
For you
For you
For you

So, why?
Why can't we come together?
Why?

Why?
Why can't we come together?
Why?
