There She Goes

There She Goes again

Racing through my brain

And I just can't contain

This feeling that remains

There She Goes

There She Goes again

Pulsing through my veins
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There She Goes
(There She Goes again)
There She Goes again
(There She Goes again)
Racing through my brain
(There She Goes)
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There She Goes
There She Goes again
She calls my name
Pulls my train
No one else could heal my pain
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There She Goes
(she calls my name)
There She Goes again
(she calls my name)
Chasing down my lane
(she calls my name)
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There She Goes
(There She Goes again)
There She Goes
(There She Goes again)
There She Goes
