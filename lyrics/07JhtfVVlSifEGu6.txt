The wind that shakes the barley, it will not shake me
The wind that shakes the barley, it will not shake me
The wind that shakes the barley won't shake me
Like my momma told me, this I know when I see

Well the fire that takes the kindling will not take me

Ooooh Ooooh-a Hey

Ooooh Ooooh

The dark before the dawn breaks, it will not bind me
The dark before the dawn breaks will not bind me

Well the wind that shakes the barley, it will not shake me
The wind that shakes the barley, it will not shake me
The wind that shakes the barley won't shake me
Like my momma told me, this I know when I see

Ooooh Ooooh
Ooooh Ooooh

Like my momma told me, this I know when I see
