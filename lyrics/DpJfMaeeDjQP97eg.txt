Hahahahaa!

(Whispered) Jump on my pleasure pill!

Yes Please ha ha!

Ahh Hah!

I cannot sleep
There's too much noise in my head

I cannot sleep
I want it here instead

I never thought that this could come to this
I just wanna live with your bliss in
peace now

You'll never miss
But I can

Ah hah!

I can not keep
The shame that's clawed us out
I will not keep
Your shut-up shut-up lies
I never thought that this could come to this
I just wanna live with your bliss in
peace now...
You will never miss
But I can
Ahh hah ha!
