Black saint, sinner lady
Playin' knock-off soul
A punk rock romantic
Slumped on the kitchen floor
Nuns in stress positions
Smokin' Marlboros
Lolita is weeping
The bride is beautiful

Masseduction
Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Masseduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on

Smilin' nihilist met
Angry glass half full
Drinkin' Manic Panic
Singin' Boatman's Call
Teenage, Christian virgins
Holdin' out their tongues
Paranoid secretions
Fallin' on basement rugs

Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Masseduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on

Oh, what a bore to be so adored
Oh, what a bore to be so adored

Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on

Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on
Mass destruction
I hold you like a weapon

I can't turn off what turns me on
I can't turn off what turns me on
I hold you like a weapon
I can't turn off what turns me on

Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on

Mass destruction
