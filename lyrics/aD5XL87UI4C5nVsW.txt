mellow-"Girl, I can't believe it.
You know, my mother's talking about me,
my friends are talking about me. Not me about you."
girl-"About me?"
mellow- "You're nothing but a skeezer"
girl- "A skeezer? Don't be calling me no skeezer!"
mellow-"Tremenda fletera mami si, uh huh, la verdad."
girl- "Uh huh. Eso es lo que tu te crees."
mellow-"I bet you go to church and you're scared to confess."
girl-"No, I do confess baby. I do confess."
mellow-"Uh huh. Do you tell the truth, though?"
girl-"Yeah I do."
mellow-"Yeah right."
girl-"Do you?"
mellow-"Yeah! You're nothing but a skeezer you know what?
I got some other stories to say about you. And it goes like this."

Un dia estaba en tu casa y ring there goes the phone
recogiste y dijiste ("call me back, I'm not alone.")
el queria tu direccion, yeah just your address
y antes que colgaste I heard u say ("I'll wear a dress.")
alabao que descarada is what ran through my mind
so I say lets go out tonight", she says ("we go out all time.")
"oh, oh man!"
ella no sabia that yo I knew her plan,
de que iba a salir with that other man
so I told the girl in Spanish I said "hey ya me voy." (pero porque?)
cause you ain't treating me like I'm some sucker toy
cause who needs u anyways (I need you!)
con tu lengua venenosa (No te vayas Mellow, no te vayas! Yo te necesito!)
today you tell me something y manana es otra cosa (tsk! but?!)
MENTIROSA!
