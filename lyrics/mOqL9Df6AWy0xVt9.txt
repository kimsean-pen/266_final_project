I would be so much better
If you could help me understand
I need your lover and I need an open hand

You say I'm so chill
I'm gonna kick him out still
Yeah, boy, I'm so chill
I'm gonna kick him out

I know I could, could, kick, kick him out
I need an open mind, I need an open mouth
You say I'm so chill
I'm gonna kick him out still
Yeah, boy, I'm so chill
I'm gonna kick him out

Even though, even though I'm on an island
Eyes are always right by you
By you

I would be so much better
If you could help me figure out
How I could be so much
How I could be so loud

You say I'm so chill
I'm gonna kick him out still
Yeah, boy, I'm so chill
I'm gonna kick him out

Even though, even though I'm on an island
Eyes are always right by you
By you

Isn't it fun?
Isn't all of it fun?
Out of your tongue
And onto your tongue
Isn't it fun?
Isn't all of it fun?
Off of your tongue
And onto your tongue

My eyes are always right by you
By you
By you
I'm gonna kick, kick, kick, kick him out
Kick, kick him out
I'm gonna kick, kick, kick, kick him out
Kick, kick him out
Kick, kick him out
Kick, kick, kick, kick him out
Kick, kick him out
Kick, kick him out
Kick, kick, kick, kick him out
