Squat made the beat
Go Grizz
Who?
W-W-W-Winner's Circle

We was coolin', smokin', minding our own business
Why he hatin'? Why he mad? Why you lying, bitch?
I don't care about nobody but my own clique
And if you test, we gon' show him how to throw a fit

Fuck a bitch, boy, and fuck a nigga too, shit
I give no fuck about who the fuck you cooling with
You gon' all fall, lil nigga, let's get started with it
I ain't a friend, I'm the end, nigga, deal with it

I'm in tip top shape, I wouldn't play with it
I smoke a hundred new blunts when the day begin
What we eatin' today? My nigga I feel Italian
What's your name again?, baby, I wasn't listening

Fuck a bitch, boy, and fuck a nigga too, shit
I give no fuck about who the fuck she came with
They all schemin' for a reason to be seen here
I told her, "Bitch, uh, no thank you, I don't need you, dear"

You see me riding solo but I don't need shit
I light a blunt and forget about a hatin' bitch
Why you mad, boy? You could've been on the same ship
But you a lame with no lane to your name, bitch
I'm a East Memphis nigga we ain't gon' chill with ya
We don't spare 'em, we ain't gon' cut no damn deals with ya
Fuck fame, nigga, I'ma keep it real with ya
I made your main bitch turn her other cheek to ya

Fuck a bitch, boy, and fuck a nigga too, shit
Trunk banging, bitch thought I threw a zoo in it
I pull up and act a ass, I bought a mule with it
I've been a fool since the first day of school with it

Uh uh, nuh uh, she went too easy, I'ma let you hit it
I pull up with a bitch that you can never say you hit
I'm a mack, not a player I can teach her shit
Only if she got a brain will I deal with it

Fuck a bitch, boy, and fuck a nigga too, shit
How you lose all of the love from your home clique?
Three faced fuck niggas always switching shit
I'ma switch a new face and end the day, bitch
Who? nigga (who?)
