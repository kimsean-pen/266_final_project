Feigning joy and surprise
At the gifts we despise over mulled wine
With you

On the 25th day
Of the 12th month the sleigh bells of winter
Ringing true

How we cling each noel
To that snowflake's hope in hell

That it would end
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time

Just let them ring in peace
When the weather is cruel

And the season of Yule warms the heart
But it still hurts
You've got your career

Spend the best part of life stood apart
And it still hurts
So that's why I pray
Each and every Christmas day

That it would end
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time
Just let them ring in peace

(Christmas time)

(Don't let the bells end)
(Christmas time)
(Don't let the bells end)
Dust underneath
The mistletoe leaves
When you're not here,
You went away upon boxing day,
Now how the hell am I gonna make it into the New Year?
Christmas time
Don't let the bells end (Don't let it end)
Christmas time
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time
Don't let the bells end (just let them ring in peace)
Christmas time (c'mon kids)
Don't let the bells end (bells end)
Christmas time
Don't let the bells end
