We're all beginners in here
There's a price you need to pay
Keep the evident clear
Might be time to runaway

Stayed inside a bubble at the dance
Giving in to your knees
Give it on the lips keep flying through the walls
Come on now won't you please

Run baby run
We're leaving nothing undone
You are my only mission
Uuuh yeah
Don't climb the vision
You know we've only just been gone
Baby I want you now

Lets keep running away
Wipe those tears off your face
Why why would you stay
Or it would be such a waste

Stayed inside a bubble at the dance
Giving in to your knees
Give it on the lips keep flying through the walls
Come on now won't you please

Run baby run
We're leaving nothing undone
You are my only mission
Uuuh yeah
Don't climb the vision
You know we've only just been gone
Baby I want you now

Flying through the walls now
Flying through the walls now
Flying through the walls now
Flying through the walls now
Flying through the walls now
Flying through the walls now
Flying through the walls now
Flying through the walls now
