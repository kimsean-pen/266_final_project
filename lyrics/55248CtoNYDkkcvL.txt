Aaaaah
Aaaaah

Seasons mean nothing
You went away and I'm falling

Even clouds have tried their best to move and give my tears a rest

Aaaaah
Aaaaah

Seasons mean nothing
You went away and I'm falling

Even when the cold disarms it still feels like there's something wrong

Aaaaah
Aaaaah

Seasons mean nothing
You went away and I'm falling

Even when the leaves turn brown in sympathy about the ground

Aaaaah
Aaaaah
