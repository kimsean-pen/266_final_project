You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You're what we heard at night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You're what we heard at night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night

You were a thud in the night
You're what we heard at night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You're what we heard at night

We're high above your golden veins
We're high above your golden veins
We're high above your golden veins
The life, the life, the life

You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You're what we heard at night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You're what we heard at night

Oh let me walk around these walls
Correct your words forget my thoughts
And let you feel some life in here
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Swimming through the diamond sea
There's dancing lights surrounding me
Now high above your golden veins
The life, the life, the life

You are the only one
My soul it knows no one other than you
Oh you know I love you
You are the only one
My soul it knows no one other than you
Oh you know I love you
You are the only one
My soul it knows no one other than you
Oh you know I love you
You are the only one
My soul it knows no one other than you
Oh you know I love you

You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You're what we heard at night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You're what we heard at night

Heard in the night
Heard in the night
Heard in the night
Heard in the night
Heard in the night
Heard in the night
Heard in the night
Heard in the night
Heard in the night
Heard in the night
Heard in the night
Heard in the night

We're high above your golden veins
We're high above your golden veins
We're high above your golden veins
The life, the life, the life
We're high above your golden veins
We're high above your golden veins
We're high above your golden veins
The life, the life, the life

You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You're what we heard at night
You were a thud in the night
