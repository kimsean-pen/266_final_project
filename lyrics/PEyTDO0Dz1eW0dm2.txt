I know
Oh, Oh Yeah

Hey baby
Why you rushing?
Let's sit back and watch the flowers grow
Why you wanna
Swim against the tide?
Let's lay and watch the river flow

Here in God's creation
There is always a reason
I know that love is there for us
Yeah

Where we'll go, baby I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show
Where we'll go, baby I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show

I don't wanna watch no movie
Let's sit and watch the stars put on a show
If you want to win my favor
Be creative, and show me your flavor
Cause here in God's creation
For everything there is a season
Let go
Let life
Let love
Let God

Where we'll go, baby I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show
Where we'll go, baby I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show

Like the sun shines and
The wind blows
Like the birds fly
And the moon glows
If I am meant for you and
You are meant for me
Then we will flow together
Everlastly

Where we'll go, baby I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show
Where we'll go, baby I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show
Maybe we should just sit and watch the flowers grow
Maybe we should sit, back and watch the moon glow
Maybe we should just sit and feel the wind blow
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

First you plant a seed
And then it grows and
Then it blooms
And it dies
That's the cycle of life
Same goes for you and I
Maybe this time we'll get it right

Go with the flow
Maybe we'll get it right.
