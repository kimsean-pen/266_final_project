And you live your life with your arms stretched out
Eye to eye when speaking
Enter rooms with great joy shouts
Happy to be meeting

And bright, bright, bright, bright as yellow
Warm as yellow

And I do not want to be a rose
I do not wish to be pale pink
But flower scarlet, flower gold
And have no thorns to distance me

But be bright, bright, bright, bright as yellow
Warm as yellow

Even if I'm shouting
Even if I'm shouting
Here inside
Even if I'm shouting
Do you see that I'm wanting
That I want to be so so bright, bright, bright, bright as yellow
Warm as yellow
