I'm feeling sexy and free
Like glitter's raining on me
You're like a shot of pure gold
I think I'm about to explode

I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing like I'm running
'Cause you're taking me there
Don't you know
You spin me out of control

Uh, uh, uh, uh
We can do this all night
Damn, this love is skin tight
Baby, come on

Uh, uh, uh, uh
Pull me like a bass drum
Sparkin' up a rhythm
Baby, come on

Uh, uh, uh, uh

Rock my world into the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

Every second is a highlight
When we touch don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

You got me losing my mind
My heart beats out of time
I'm seeing Hollywood stars
You stroke me like a guitar

I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing like I'm running
'Cause you're taking me there
Don't you know
You spin me out of control

Uh, uh, uh, uh
We can do this all night
Damn, this love is skin tight
Baby, come on

Uh, uh, uh, uh
Pull me like a bass drum
Sparkin' up a rhythm
Baby, come on

Uh, uh, uh, uh

Rock my world into the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

Every second is a highlight
When we touch don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

Oh baby baby, got me feeling so right
Oh baby baby, dancing in the moonlight
Oh baby baby, got me feeling so right
Oh baby baby, dancing in the moonlight
Oh baby baby, got me feeling so right
Oh baby baby, dancing in the moonlight
Oh baby baby, got me feeling so right
Oh baby baby

Uh, uh, uh, uh

Rock my world into the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

Every second is a highlight
When we touch don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
