You are in my bed
I heard what you said
Well you were in my bed
So I heard what you said
Should we nip this bud?
Can we give this up?
We're not wasting time
I'm with you for life
And it got colder
Every day
But I wouldn't change my mind
It got darker
Every night
But I wouldn't change my mind, no
Should we nip this bud?
Can we give this up?
We're not wasting time
I'm with you for life
And it got colder
Every day
But I wouldn't change my mind
It got darker
Every night
But I wouldn't change my mind, no
I never thought that you would become my greatest friend
I never thought that you would become my greatest friend
And it got colder
Every day
But I wouldn't change my mind
It got darker
Every night
But I wouldn't change my mind
I'm a sucker for you
I'm a sucker for you
