Right this way
The room's full to burst
Whatever you say
Gotta quench that thirst

I've got a little secret for you
It's in a magazine
You've got an urge to keep safe
Been now stay clean, yeah

Now talk the loudest with a clenched fist
Top of a helix, gag a witness
It takes a fat lip to run a tight ship
Just talk the loudest with a clenched fist

Wash your winning smile
Let your eyes work the room
These people are here for you
You're the bride, you're the groom

I've got a little secret for you
It's in a magazine
You've got an urge to keep safe
Been now stay clean, yeah

Now talk the loudest with a clenched fist
Top of a helix, gag a witness
It takes a fat lip to run a tight ship
Just talk the loudest with a clenched fist
Yeah, you talk the loudest

Now talk the loudest with a clenched fist
Top of a helix, bend over a witness
It takes a fat lip to run a tight ship
Just talk the loudest you're making them sing
You're making them sing

It don't mean a thing, it don't mean a thing
You're making them sing
You're making them sing
t don't mean a thing, it don't mean a thing
You're making them sing
You're making them sing
It don't mean a thing, it don't mean
It don't mean
It don't mean a thing
It don't mean a thing
