Reality's a dream, a game in which I seem
To never find out just what I am
I don't know if I'm an actor or ham, a shamen or sham
But if you don't mind and I don't mind

I'm lost without a clue so how can I undo
The tangle of these webs I keep weaving
I don't know if I should be believing, deceptive perceiving
But if you don't mind and I don't mind

I used to bet that you didn't care
But gambling never got me anywhere
Each time I used to feel so sure
Something about you made me doubt you more

How can you convince me, when everything I see
Just makes me feel you're putting me down
And if it's true, this pathetic clown'll keep hanging around
That's if you don't mind and I don't mind

I used to bet that you didn't care
But gambling never got me anywhere
Each time I used to be so sure
Something about you made me doubt you more

I even think you hate me when you call me on the phone
And sometimes when we go out, then I wish, I'd stayed at home
And when I'm dreaming or just lying in my bed
I think you've got it in for me, is it all in my head? Is it in my head?

How can you convince me, when everything I see
Just makes me feel you're putting me down
And if it's true this pathetic clown'll keep hanging around
That's if you don't mind and I don't mind, I don't mind
