Are you sure you won't pay?
Life's only a delusional gain
Your redemption is just the way to keep

My head is empty
I feel so scared
And it's killing me from far away
And i'm not sure about wasting my day
My body is empty
I feel no glare
Time is flowing beyond our gaze
I'm only sure that we'll fade someday

Is there a word?
They can't survive a grace like this
I'm always wrong and it's killing me
Your redemption is just a way to sink
Embracing all their sins is killing me

My head is empty
I feel so scared
And it's killing me from far away
And i'm not sure about wasting my day
My body is empty
I feel no glare
Time is flowing beyond our gaze
I'm only sure that we'll fade someday
