don't you worry if we burn
all the light falls back to earth
deck of jokers for my hand

any woe woe woes we've got
drinking free beer on the clock
what could be freer that us?
no one is more free than us
what could be more free than?

I don't want you to think I'm down
I don't want you to think I'm out though
I don't want you to think I'm down and out about

Who says?
who says you're right?
Who says?

I do the best you can
You do the best I can
I do the best you can
You do the best I

Who says?
who says you're right?
Who says?

Tell my sister when I'm gone
I built a ladder to the sun
