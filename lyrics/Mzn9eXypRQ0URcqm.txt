There's too many minds around me
This company is making me crazy

There's voices in my head, breaking my spirit
Can't stop wishing they were dead, don't wanna hear it
Opinions in my head, my biggest fear is that they'll
Multiply and spread, don't wanna feel it
Looking, Looking, Looking over my shoulder
As paranoid, paranoid as a criminal

There's too many minds around me
This company is making me crazy
And I know I shouldn't care what they think
There's too many minds around me
I can't let my soul speak
(I can't let my soul speak)

Illusions in my head make me believe that
The monsters under my bed can hear me breathing
I'm looking, looking, looking over my shoulder
As paranoid, paranoid as a criminal

There's too minds around me
This company is making me crazy
And I know I shouldn't care what they think
There's too many minds around me
I can't let my soul speak
(Soul Speak, soul Speak)
I gotta let my soul speak
(Soul Speak, soul Speak)
I gotta let my soul speak, yeah

There's to many minds around me
This company is making me crazy
And I know I shouldn't care what they think
There's too many minds around me
I can't let my soul speak
(Soul Speak, soul Speak)
I can't let my soul speak
(I can't let my soul speak)
