I'm going back
Of course I am
As if I ever had a choice
Back to what I always knew I was
On the inside
Back to what I really am
Look at this pathetic place I made
With little bits of sticks and hair
And anything I found along the way
And tell yourself, you know?
You're not really what you know you are
You know?
Of course you do
I think I may have even listened to you
I think I may have even listened to you
At the height of my demise

Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe...
Break through the surface and breathe

I am forgiven
I am free
I am a field on fire

And oh my God, I have missed you
It has been so long
And I am stronger than I have ever been in my decline
I am stronger than I have ever been in my decline
For now I know, now I know, now I know for certain
Now I know for certain
Oh, burn motherfucker
Carry the carcass and throw it on
Pull up a chair and watch
The flies come roaring out
And will surround the entire world
And blacken out the sky and every last one of you
Like a plague of locusts
Like an exit
Like an end
Like an end
Like an end
Like the end

Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe...
Break through the surface and breathe

I am forgiven
I am free
I am a field on fire

I can't tell if I am dreaming anymore
