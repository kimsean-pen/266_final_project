I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love and then softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love
Is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
They should all just let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think
That I care for you
Well, you know down inside
That I really do
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love
Is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
They should all just let us be
We belong to you and me

Da da da da da
Da da da da da
Da da da
Da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love and then softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love
Is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
They should all just let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
