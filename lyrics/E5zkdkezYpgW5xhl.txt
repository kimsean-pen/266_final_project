You send me out
Walking through the forest of doubt
I know they hear me now
Through the moonlight trees
I need you close to cover me

Like a child, I wondered into the den
Facing the foolish of the wisest men (O-ooh)
I keep singing that-

Sweet faith
Sweet faith
The wolves are on my side
But I know that it can fight
So I won't hide no
I keep singing that
Sweet faith

You sent me on a quest
And you hid your treasure in my chest
Baby, they don't know it yet
But my weary eyes inside of me

Like a child, I wondered into the den
Facing the foolish of the wisest men (O-ooh)
I keep singing that-

Sweet faith
Sweet faith
The wolves are on my side
But I know that it can fight
So I won't hide no
I keep singing that
Sweet faith

I won't run away, oh no
I won't run away, oh no
When the wolves say "go home, go home"
I wait for you
It's time to let them through my mind

When the wolves say "go home, go home"
I dare to stay right here in silence
Fearing the darkness
I keep singing that

Sweet faith
Sweet faith
The wolves are on my side
But I know that it can fight
So I won't hide, no
Sweet faith

(Faith)
(Faith)
(Faith)
