See what I get
When the medicine wears off
You're moving fast
Try a little, see if I can make
The moment last
You'll burn the night up like a star
You'll break this heart, you know
When you're coming 'round, you're
Taken by wonder of it all
Where are you now?
Longing for the state of mind
Oh, I remember why we started blocking all we said

See what I get
When the medicine wears off
See what I get
When the medicine wears off
