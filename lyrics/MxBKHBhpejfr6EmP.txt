I see my pretty face in his old eyes
I listen to our blood run side by side
I throw my hands to you
I runaway
Its so cold so dangerous that I cant stay
I runaway from you
Into your dream I lose the one
That I was in when you to be
That I could never
Meet my friends
Again

I thought I touched them but I can't feel the pain in your dream
They want to take me but I will hide from them
I use my pretty face to find my way to him
I runaway from you
Into your dream I lose the one
That I was in when you to be
That I could never meet my friends
Again
Will you be my friend in my dream?
Take that pretty face off and show me
Will we ever have a baby?
Take that pretty face off surely
Are you my friend?
Will you be my friend in my dream?
Take that pretty face off show me
