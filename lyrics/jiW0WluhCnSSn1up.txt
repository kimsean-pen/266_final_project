And when you rise in the morning sun
I feel you touch my hand in the pouring rain

And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love then you softly leave

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
'cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I believe in you
You know you're the door to my barest soul
You're the light in the deepest darkest hour

You're my saviour when I fall
And you may not think that I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn

'cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
You're my light
You're my light
And you may not think that I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
How deep is your love

I really need to learn
'cause we're living in a world of fools
They're breaking us down
When they all should let us be

We belong to you and me
(How deep is your love)
So how deep is your love
How deep is your love
(How deep is your love)
So how deep is your love
How deep is your love
