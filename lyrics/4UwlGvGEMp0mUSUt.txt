I'm taking my right with destiny
Willing to play my part
Living with painful memories
Loving with all my heart

Made in Heaven
Made in Heaven
It was all meant to be, yeah
Made in Heaven
Made in Heaven

That's what they say, can't you see?
That's what everybody says to me, can't you see?
Oh, I know, I know, I know that it's true
Yes, it's really meant to be
Deep in my heart

I'm having to learn to pay the price
They're turning me upside down
Waiting for possibilities
Don't see too many around

Made in Heaven
Made in Heaven
It's for all to see
Made in Heaven
Made in Heaven

That's what everybody says, everybody says to me
It was really meant to be
Oh, can't you see
Yeah, everybody, everybody says
Yes, it was meant to be
Yeah, yeah

When stormy weather comes around
It was made in Heaven
When sunny skies breakthrough behind the clouds
I wish it could last forever, yeah
Wish it could last forever, forever

I'm playing my role in history
Looking to find my goal
Taking in all this misery
But giving it all my soul

Made in Heaven
Made in Heaven
It was all meant to be
Made in Heaven
Made in Heaven

That's what everybody says, wait and see
It was really meant to be
So plain to see, yeah
Everybody, everybody, everybody tells me so
Yes, it was plain to see
Yes, it was meant to be
Written in the stars
Written in the stars
Written in the stars
