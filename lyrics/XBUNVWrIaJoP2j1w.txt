Spray paint the cameras
Jam the frequency
What you kill just comes alive in me
Hoods and bandanas make not an enemy
You can't define us anyway you please

You make the rules we make the calls
My conscience clean my sins absolved

Because I found god
In the sound of your factories burning down
Now I sleep so sound

When it all comes down
Will you say you did
Everything you could?
When it all comes down
Can you say that you never gave up?

Or were you standing by
To watch it fall away?
Will you hold on or let it go?

Instead of doing what's right
They built higher walls

Where we can't shed a light
On true criminals
When business and suffering
Is one and the same when
Laws fail the people
They turn to the flame

I found love
I found life
As a thorn stuck in your side
And you wonder why

When it all comes down
Will you say you did
Everything you could?
When it all comes down
Can you say that you never gave up?
Or were you standing by
To watch it fall away
Will you hold on
Did you hold on or just let it fall?
Did you let it fall?

When it all comes down
Will you say you did
Everything you could?
When it all comes down
Can you say that you never gave up?

When it all comes down
Will you say you did
Everything you could?
When it all comes down

When it all comes down

When the lights all go out
And roadblocks go up
As we sleep to the sound
Of alarms going off

When it all comes down
Will you say you did
Everything you could?
