Take the car, and turn it into our alibis
Discard the body, pop some pills and you'll be fine
Purge, then binge, restart and insert the sutures
Turn off the lights, I'm watching Back to the Future

Before we go too far, I won't let you take this light
Before we go too far, I won't let you take this light ('cause we laughed at assimilation)

Breathe in all mistakes without coming clean
Into hobbling faith, no one I wanna know
(Waltzing right, waltzing right, waltzing right into the bank)

Is this surreal tonight? We'll go for all these wins
Is this surreal tonight? I'll go far and I'll ride

They said that you have got a map of my insides
Purge, then binge, pop some pills and you'll be fine

Moments fade, we have come to place these hands on your face
Hobbling into faith, he is alive, I have opened, now know

(Remove the ribs if you can't lean sideways)
Stay back from our lungs (I thought my words would have mass appeal)
(Costs your life, sly as always)
Stay back from our lungs (I thought my words would have mass appeal)

Cover your eyes
I've stabbed you in the back
You stop this, I can't
Please stop me
Right here
I won't do this again
I can't do this, I love you
For all of this shit
Why, Why, Help
