I get a little bit ambitious
That's why you love me
Because you can't resist it
You'll do anything for me

You want an out but we're off the ground
So pick up your parachute
'Cause I'm not gonna let you down
No, I won't let you get away
Not that easy anyway

I know what I want and I want you for the cause
How does anybody get anything done
You depend on us
But you'll never get to Heaven as a radical son
Just keep it up soldier

You want out
I can't help
I've got to make you understand
You gotta take it like a man

Do you need a dozen roses
Would you like a box of chocolate
Is it really such a deep cut
That I have to come and stitch it up

Yeah, I get a little crazy with the razor blades
Go on and call your mama if you need a band-aid
But everything worth it hurts a little bit
You don't want to run away and I won't let you anyway

'Cause we're doing it for the cause
How do you suppose I get anything done
You're making it so hard
But you'll never get to Heaven as a radical son
Just keep it up soldier

You want out
I can't help
I've got to make you understand
You gotta take it like a man

I want you for the cause
How does anybody get anything done
You depend on us
You'll never get to Heaven as a radical son
Don't be running off
'Cause this is love
What did you think it was
Ooh, the thing is love, Love

So don't go
You want out
I can't help
I've got to make you understand
You gotta take it like a man
Take it like a man
You gotta take it like a man
You gotta take it like a man
