We'll stay up late
I'll end up sleeping on the floor
The people here are nothing new
I'll see how I'm feeling...
Nah, fuck this I'm leaving

Conversation is wearing thin
I don't even know whose house this is
I kinda wish I just stayed home
But Friday night is boring on my own

And then she makes her entrance
Stumbles defenseless through the door
Her dirty tricks hid up her sleeve
She's done this a thousand times before

You can brag, you can gloat
Eat your words, hope you choke
But the grass on your side doesn't seem so green
All the shit that you spoke
Will you sink? Will you float?
Will you hang by a rope from the old oak tree?

She's a witch
She's a mess
She's a waste of time
Damsel in distress on a steep decline

When all she wants is someone to keep her warm
Maybe I'll walk home on my own to sleep it off
And think about some things as I stumble through the dark
But the only glimpse of me in her I could see
Was in her left wing mirror staring back at me

Now you're at home I guess you're alone again
It's 5am as she stumbles to bed
Plays out thoughts in her head
Falls asleep then wakes up wishing she was
Dead and disgusted with those who she's trusted
To just be fucked over and left in the dust
So she'll cling to her bottle
And hope that tomorrow she won't sit and wallow again

She's a witch
She's a mess
She's a waste of time
Damsel in distress on a steep decline
When all she wants is someone to keep her warm

She's 21 next year but she's lost her mind
She fucks it up almost every time she tries
She grabbed my hand as I walked her to her door
