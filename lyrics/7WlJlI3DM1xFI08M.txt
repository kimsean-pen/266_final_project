Days of lavender; they pass me by
And still I hide the ugly flowers in... in my mind

Diamond fires light up gentle skies,
At dusk I wake up in your chamber of lies, with vacant eyes.

Save your money, lie to someone else
Someone who's not tired of mistreatment in themselves.

Mournful solitary tears I cry
In faith I search for only trips that flew in your eyes.

When you're gone.(When you're gone)
I tried so hard to love someone without you.
I gave my heart to anyone who's like you,
I needed you to be here, but you're gone.

Now you're gone.(Yeah.)
I dream about the days you were beside me.(beside me)
I'd love to feel that way just one more day.
I needed you to be here, but you're gone.

When you're gone. (When you're gone)
I tried so hard to love someone without you.
I gave my heart to anyone who's like you.
I needed you to be here, but you're gone.

Now you're gone. (Yeah...)

I'd love to feel that way just one more day.
