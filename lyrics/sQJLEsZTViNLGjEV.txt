Now it's decision time
Which one will stay? Which one will say goodbye?
And just my luck to find
Someone that makes me want to leave her behind

We took the back seat, everyone was happy
We took the back way, everybody laughed
We took the back seat, everyone was happy

Now it's decision time
Which one will stay? Which one will say goodbye?

And I've woken up in so many rooms
I'm sorry that I left so soon
I didn't want to break anybody's mood
Cause last night you woke me up
We almost fell in love
But then you said
It was time for bed

We took the back seat, everyone was happy
We took the back way, everybody laughed
We took the back seat, everyone was happy
