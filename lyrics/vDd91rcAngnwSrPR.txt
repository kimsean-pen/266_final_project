Even though you're gone and far away
I feel you all around
I think about it every single day
You got away somehow

I can't sleep
It's hard to breathe
And I still feel you next to me

Now, I can see
The first one is the worst one
When it comes to a broken heart
(Whoa, oh, oh)
Your first love, yeah, you're so young
And you feel like a fallin' star
(Whoa, oh, oh)
There's a fire in the city
That's burnin' out tonight
And you're breathing
But you're barely alive

(Woah, oh, oh)
The first one is the worst one
When it comes
When it comes to a broken heart

Spinnin' like a movie in my head
I've seen a thousand times
I've learn to take it hard

And fall instead
I'm sittin' safe on the sidelines
Lost days
Pictures fade
Somehow, you're still miles away
It's safe to say
The first one is the worst one
When it comes to a broken heart
(Whoa, oh, oh)
Your first love, yeah, you're so young
And you feel like a fallin' star

(Whoa, oh, oh)
There's a fire in the city
That's burnin' out tonight
And you're breathing

But you're barely alive
(Woah, oh, oh)
The first one is the worst one

When it comes
When it comes to a broken heart
'Cause I would walk through a thunderstorm just to kiss you
I'm out here on my own
Better now than I was before
But, I miss you, and I want you to know
I can't sleep
It's hard to breathe
And I still feel you next to me
And I can see, yeah
The first one is the worst one
When it comes to a broken heart
(Whoa, oh, oh)
Your first love, yeah, you're so young
And you feel like a fallin' star
(Whoa, oh, oh)
There's a fire in the city
That's burnin' out tonight
And you're breathing
But you're barely alive
(Woah, oh, oh)
The first one is the worst one
When it comes
When it comes to a broken heart
The first one is the worst one
When it comes to a broken heart
(I feel you all around)
Your first love, yeah, you're so young
And you feel like a fallin' star
(You got away somehow)
There's a fire in the city
That's burnin' out tonight
And you're breathing
But you're barely alive
The first one is the worst one
When it comes
When it comes to a broken heart
