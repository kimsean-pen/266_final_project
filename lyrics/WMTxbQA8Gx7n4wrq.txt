A dead start in my head
And the day has been laid
The things I really want

Always torn from my heart
You never saw the way
How I wanted you to stay now that you are gone

I'm on my own
When I was thinking this
Was something permanent

You were already thinking
Of going away
Of going away

Of going away
Of going away
Of going away
Of going away.
