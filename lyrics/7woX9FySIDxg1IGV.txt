I bought a new pair of shoes
I got a new attitude, when I walk
'Cause I'm so over you (you-ou-ou-ou)
And it's all about tonight
I'm going out with the girls (gi-i-rls)
Ready to show all the boys what I got (got, got, got)
I'm letting go of the hurt
'Cause it's all about tonight
Yeah the night is alive
You can feel the heartbeat
Let's just go with the flow
We've been working all week
Tomorrow doesn't matter
When you're moving your feet
It's all about tonight
We'll be dancing and singing
And climbing up on the tables
We'll be rocking this party
So tell the DJ don't stop
Grab someone if you're single
Grab someone if you're not
It's all about tonight
And boy I'm not hanging on
'cause I threw all your drama away
Had something good but it's gone (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah it's all about tonight
They got the music so loud (so loud, so loud)
So I won't I hear the phone if you call
And we're so over now (so over now)
'cause it's all about tonight
Yeah the night is alive
You can feel the heartbeat (feel the heartbeat)
Let's just go with the flow
We've been working all week (working all week)
Tomorrow doesn't matter
When you're moving your feet (ohhhh)
It's all about tonight (weeoooh)
We'll be dancing and singing
And climbing up on the tables
We'll be rocking this party
So tell the DJ don't stop
Grab someone if you're single
Grab someone if you're not
It's all about tonight
night ni-night, night, night, night
night, night, night, night...
Yeah the night is alive
You can feel the heartbeat
Let's just go with the flow
We've been working all week (working all week yeah)
Tomorrow doesn't matter
When you're moving your feet (moving your feet)
It's all about tonight (it's all about tonight)
We'll be dancing and singing
And climbing up on the tables
We'll be rocking this party
So tell the DJ don't D-D
Grab someone if you're single
Grab someone if you're not
It's all about tonight
