I've been trying to find you
In the dark, in the dark
Middle of the night I'm searching for the light

I've been trying to find you
In the dark, in the dark
Middle of the night I'm searching for the light
searching for the light

Where do you go when you fall asleep?
I know, I know that you find what you seek
Running alone when you hide in your dreams
Can you take me? Can you take me?

I can feel your breathing (I can feel your breathing)
Is it so. is it right?
Do you ever see me?
When you close your eyes
Still searching for the light

Where do you go when you fall asleep?
I know, I know that you find what you seek
Running alone when you hide in your dreams
Can you take me? Can you take me?

Oh I bleed my heart out
To find I was inside
So tell me with your heart out
What's inside your mind?

Where do you go when you fall asleep?
I know, I know

Where do you go when you fall asleep?
I know, I know that you find what you seek
Running alone when you hide in your dreams
Can you take me? Can you take me?

Where do you go? Where do you go?
Can you take me? Can you take me?
