A girl so beautiful sleeps on the couch
There's a little baby in her blouse
She is my only one true love
In the world
Cause she's my fucking girl
We really don't wait for the big change
Time just seems to slip away
Let the cat out the bag again
My friend
It never seems to end

Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
Only when my hands have fallen asleep
Can you steal me?

All the sudden, yeah she wakes up
The dreams she been dreaming, yeah wasn't made up
We really don't wait for the big change
My friend
I hope it never ends

Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
Only when my hands have fallen asleep
Can you steal me?

And I just want to tell you
My mother was traumatized
I just want to tell you
My father was traumatized
I just want to show you
I love you
Yeah every single night
Yeah I just want to show you
I'll show you
I'll show you my life

And I'm traumatized

Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
Only when my hands have fallen asleep
Can you steal me?
Only when my mind plays tricks on me
Can you feel me?
Yeah
