Slowly down the avenue
And the irony of liking you
What was to be some brand new shoes
Now them colour has come out pure blue

I'd love to love the sunshine thru
But love in doubt will not have two
The novelty will out last you
Comin' down the ledge will do, see it thru, me and you

I love you when you love me, and we're gonna make a big family

Driving down the afternoon
Something that can not be tuned
I'd love to make things out with you
But the flowers were too lame to move

Outside the signs were two by two
The novelty comes out to you
The Philadelphia blue lagoon
Jumpin' up and down the moon
