Sleep well
You can, baby
It's cold outside
And I can hear the rain

On the rooftop
Where I spend my lonely nights
As the sunlight fades the cold stands with the night

Won't you love me
Like I know I'm loving you
Won't you need me
Say that you do

When you open
Your eyes, baby
The colour lives and the darkness fades away

Through the narrow streets
Somewhere down the seas
We can live our days to the city's lullaby

Won't you love me
Like I know I'm loving you
Won't you need me
Say that you do

Won't you love me
Like I know I'm loving you
Won't you need me
Say that you do
