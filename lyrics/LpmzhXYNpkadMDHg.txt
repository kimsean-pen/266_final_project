I'm not Snow White but I'm lost inside this forest
I'm not Red Riding Hood but I think the wolves have got me
Don't want those stilettos, I'm not, not Cinderella
I don't need a knight so baby, take off all your armor
You be the beast and I'll be the beauty, beauty
Who needs true love as long as you love me truly?
I want it all but I want you more
Will you wake me up, boy, if I bite your poison apple?

I don't believe in fairytales
I don't believe in fairytales
I don't believe in fairytales
But I believe in you and me
Take me to wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to wonderland

Wonderland, wonderland

When I lay my head down to go to sleep at night
My dreams consist of things that'd make you wanna hide
Don't let me in your tower, show me your magic powers
I'm not afraid to face a little bit of danger, danger
I want the love, the money and the perfect ending
You want the same as I, I so stop pretending

I wanna show how good we can be together
I wanna love you through the night, I'll be your sweet disaster

I don't believe in fairytales
I don't believe in fairytales
But I believe in you and me
Take me to wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to wonderland
Wonderland, wonderland, wonderland, oh
I believe in you and me
I don't believe in fairytales

I don't believe in fairytales
I don't believe in fairytales
But I believe in you and me

Take me to, take me to, take me to wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to
I believe in you and me
Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to wonderland
Take me to wonderland, take me to wonderland
