Follow you to dusk
Leaving footprints under clouds as we're walking home
I am hot so, I turn to rust
Bad seeds, I'm a daze on a diamond street
It speaks apocalypse
Chasing shadows, living dreams that don't exist, anymore
We need to find a way
Well, we are, who we are, when we're all going under
When the past with the last and will last until we're under
When the past with the last and will last till we're under

Liar, liar
