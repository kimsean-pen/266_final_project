Getting to the bag, I want all of that
Got her number but I ain't calling back
Automatic whip, no stalling that
Manna call the plays like a quarterback
Get into the bag, I want all of that
Got her number but I ain't calling back
Automatic whip, no stalling that
Manna call the plays like a quarterback
Getting to the bag, I want all of that
Got her number but I ain't calling back
Automatic whip, no stalling that
Manna call the plays like a quarterback
Getting to the bag, I want all of that
Got her number but I ain't calling back
Automatic whip, no stalling that
Manna call the plays like a quarterback

I'm running up checks like a doctor
Tryna win gold like Oscar
New flow, try and do it too, impostor
Got them all running off the beat like Costa
My team got a five star roster
Little bitch threw a fit when I tossed her
If she wanna fuck twice, that'll cost her
If she wanna fuck twice, that'll cost her
Leave me be, get out my face
I secured the bag and went on my way
They behind, they're not on my page
Go learn to grind and get on my wage
You ain't bae so don't call man bae
You ain't my mate so don't call man A
Young nigga, they know my age
Free my bros, they locked in that cage
And I'll still miss the drop if I want
Turn up, finesse the chick and I'm gone
I get head and keep all the lights on
No wasteman can jump on my song
They thought I would flop and they're wrong
Still here, fit as hell my life's strong
Still here, fit as hell my life's strong
Getting to the bag, I want all of that
Got her number but I ain't calling back
Automatic whip, no stalling that
Manna call the plays like a quarterback
Get into the bag, I want all of that
Got her number but I ain't calling back
Automatic whip, no stalling that
Manna call the plays like a quarterback
Getting to the bag, I want all of that
Got her number but I ain't calling back
Automatic whip, no stalling that
Manna call the plays like a quarterback
Getting to the bag, I want all of that
Got her number but I ain't calling back
Automatic whip, no stalling that
Manna call the plays like a quarterback

I've got her number but I'm just texin'
Hittin' up my line on the next ting
I don't want you I want a next ting
Baby girl I owe you a sexing
Break man's soul when I'm flexing
But he try cap so I decked him
I took a grey ting to my hotel
And I had her on her knees when I checked in
My LA dons make the Draco fly
Had bread before the Drake co-sign
Came through, I'm here to take what's mine
No "Whatless" old man can make me sign
I was doing laps on my Ridgeback
Nah, I was doing laps on a specialized
If I had beef then I slid back
Girl you wanna fuck? Better get in line
AJ, T
Be like, me
London's best star and Q-B
If people say "fly" I'm like wait, who? me?
Made the trap jump, Jordan, 2, 3
My bitch bad, thick and bou-jee
I was in the states counting, blue, cheese
Step up on the stage and they never boo, me
Sleep on a nigga, go ahead and you'll, see
Getting to the bag, I want all of that
Got her number but I ain't calling back
Automatic whip, no stalling that
Manna call the plays like a quarterback
Get into the bag, I want all of that
Got her number but I ain't calling back
Automatic whip, no stalling that
Manna call the plays like a quarterback
Getting to the bag, I want all of that
Got her number but I ain't calling back
Automatic whip, no stalling that
Manna call the plays like a quarterback
Getting to the bag, I want all of that
Got her number but I ain't calling back
Automatic whip, no stalling that
Manna call the plays like a quarterback
