I remember when you told me
I should go back to the old me
Before the Taylor's and the tattoos
Before the Perignon and O.G

So far left and it feels so right
You sit in the back, telling me how to drive
But I need a taste of someone who's
Gonna love me for me and my new attitude

Put me in overtime, try to control my mind
Had enough of this pressure
Don't give me this pressure
It's weighing down on me
I feel like honestly
I don't fuck with this pressure
Don't give me this pressure

Feels like voodoo cause I'm always in control
I be like, "who do you think you talking to?"
Ain't no money or pussy power, no label control my mind
Make the rules up as we go and I ain't bout to stand in line

So far left and it feels so right (Feels so right)
You sit in the back, telling me how to drive
But I need a taste of someone who's (Someone who's)
Gonna love me for me and my new attitude

Put me in overtime, try to control my mind
Had enough of this pressure
Don't give me this pressure
It's weighing down on me
I feel like honestly
I don't fuck with this pressure
Don't give me this pressure

I'm frankensteinin' they wanna put me back in the lab
If I'm gonna be grinding, if I'm gonna be making this skrill
I'm gonna do it my way, bitch get out of my head
I'm gonna do it my way, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yo, put me in overtime, try to control my mind
Had enough of this pressure
Don't give me this pressure
It's weighing down on me
I feel like honestly
I don't fuck with this pressure
Don't give me this pressure
