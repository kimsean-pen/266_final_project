While he sits and stares
and girls he can't explain,
oh here she comes,
on ten white horses,
made of string and clay,
the flowers in his fingers,
wilt away.

His wise old lover said,
that lies no not deceive.
So when she sleeps,
I'll leave her bed and
hurry home instead,
My soul is on a string
tied to her hair/chair.

And why is it I pray,
to Gods that always fail,
to drag that girl back,
through my window,
and undress my face,
and smile at me,
while I put on my chains.
