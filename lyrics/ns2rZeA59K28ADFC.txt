When it's crying
Take me to a certain place
Which I don't often find
I see a family walking
Always thinking of
Being somewhere else in time
So I fall face down
In a rut
I can't seem to get out of
Please wake me
Please give me some of it back
The feelings that I had

Sometimes I wish
I could be strong like you
It doesn't matter
Each time I wake
I'm somehow feeling the truth
I can't handle

Let's get this party started
I'm sick of begging you
You make me feel insane
Which I did to you
Let's get this party started
You make me feel insane
I want to be the one
To make myself sane

Time is ticking
It makes me feel content
With what I have inside
Constant paranoia
Surrounds me
Everyone I see
Is out to get me

So I fall face down
In a rut
I can't seem to get out of
Please wake me
Please give me some of it back
The feelings I had

Sometimes I wish
I could be strong like you
It doesn't matter
Each time I wake
I'm somehow feeling the truth
I can't handle

Let's get this party started
I'm sick of begging you
You make me feel insane
Which I did to you
Let's get this party started
You make me feel insane
I want to be the one
To make myself sane

You make me feel insane
You make me feel insane
You make me feel insane
You make me feel insane
You make me feel insane
You make me feel insane

Sometimes I wish
I could be strong like you
It doesn't matter
Each time I wake
I'm somehow feeling the truth
I can't handle
Let's get this party started
I'm sick of begging you
You make me feel insane
Which I did to you
Let's get this party started
You make me feel insane
I want to be the one
To make myself sane
