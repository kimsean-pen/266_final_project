Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Oh, oh, oh

If I should die before I wake
It's 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh

I here alone, didn't want to leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete
Wish there was a way, that I can make you understand

But how do you expect me
To live alone with just me
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air, no
No air, air, no
No air, air, no
No air, air

I walked, I ran
I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
There's no gravity to hold me down
For real

But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath, but I survived
I don't know how
But I don't even care

But how do you expect me
To live alone with just me
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air, no
No air, air, no
No air, air, no
No air, air
No more

No, no, no air
No, no, no air
No, no, no air, no air, no air
No air, no
No, no, no air
No, no, no air

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air
Baby, no air
No
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air, no
No air, air (oh, oh)
No air, air (no air)
No air
