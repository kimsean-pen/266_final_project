Yeah

First it was nothing
Now you want something?
What about what you said we did?
What we should have done

You got it wrong
Don't say it again
You've said enough
Three knives to the back so I know
That this ain't where I belong
Three knives to the throat of what I love

Archaic nothing
The same stones that built their homes
Colored red with our blood
But did my pain mean something?
So here comes the flood
Your washed up stories
Of arrogance and burnt trust

But you got it wrong
Don't say it again
You've said enough
Three knives in the back so I know
That this ain't where I belong
Three knives to the throat of what I loved

Three knives slicing
We are just canines biting
Chasing something
That isn't worth saving

Oh my god
There's nowhere to run
I'm on the hunt down after you
I'm on the hunt down after you
I'm on the hunt down after you
