Hey
Down, let's take it down
Raise up their heads on a stake
We will show no mercy on evolutions mistake

Change, we'll have to wait
If we can't decide on a fate
Self-appointed prophets and their doomsday charade

You preach about love, teach about faith
But all your beliefs are still rooted in hate!

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Stop, punch in the clock
Punch it with all of your rage
Put the men in office for a minimum wage

Rats, fighting for scraps
Siphoned the gas from your tank
Left your pockets empty, as they laugh to the bank

They speak about trust, but make no mistake
They're shaking your hand while they spit in your face!

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Now! The time is now!
We can still turn it around
Raise your voice like a weapon, 'til they fall to the ground

Light! Let there be light!
Without a shadow of doubt
We will fight tooth and nail until salvation is found!

So how can you look, the world in the eyes?
When all we can see is corruption and lies!

Down on your knees, you don't look so tall
Down on your knees, you don't look so tall

Cracking the whip on the backs of the poor
We asked you to stop but you still wanted more
The blood on your hands leaves a trail as you crawl
Down on your knees you just don't look so tall!

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees you just don't look so tall!

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees you just don't look so tall!

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees you just don't look so tall!

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees, you don't look so tall
Open your eyes and the empire falls!
