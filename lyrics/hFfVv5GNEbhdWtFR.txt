she wakes up on her own
and opens her eyes
the sun tries to burn through the pain
she still feels inside

i've seen you fall apart
i know you wouldn't care
but i wish you were mine

she looks into his face
just to be near him
and the clouds come round again
nothings changed

i saw you for a lifetime
i know i shouldn't care
but i wish you were mine
and the rain keeps on falling
in my heart.
