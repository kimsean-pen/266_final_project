surrender by voices I don't want to hear

Spend you whole life waiting for a sing
you make your move to late
and love got left behind
truth is all that you don't want to see

take it from me!

--(Solo Saxophone)---

I don't care who is right or who is wrong
one day aloneness is day too long
you... only may wanna stay
sometimes around a heart is harder to brake

harder to brake!
