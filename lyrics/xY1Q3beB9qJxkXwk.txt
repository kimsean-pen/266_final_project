Well I don't know where they come from
But they sure do come
I hope they're comin' for me
And I don't know how they do it
But they sure do it good
I hope they're doin' it for free

They give me Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever

Well the first time that I got it
I was just 10 years old
I got it from some kitty next door
Well I went and seen the doctor
And he gave me the cure
I think I got it some more

They give me Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever
I got it bad scratch fever
Cat Scratch Fever

It's nothin' dangerous
I feel no pain
I got to cha-cha change
You know you got it
When your'e goin' insane
It makes a grown man cry, cry
Oh won't you make my bed

Well I make a pussy purr
With the stroke of my hand
They know they're gettin' it from me
And they know just where to go
When they need their lovin' man
They know I'm doin' it for free

I give 'em Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever
They got it bad scratch fever
Cat Scratch Fever

Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever
