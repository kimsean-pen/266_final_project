Once burned, twice shy
Too much of your light make me blind
I'd wait all night
But you left one too many times
I want to change the orbit
Don't care what you do now
I want to live in darkness
Don't want to be spun around

You go down, down, down
I fall out of love with you
Come back round, round, round
You sun of a gun
You go down, down, down
This time I won't save you
When you drown, drown, drown
You sun of a gun
You sun of a gun

Birds sing for you
You can make the blue sky blush
You've got them all fooled
But I am burned out on this rush
I want to change the orbit
Don't care what you do now
I want to live in darkness
Don't want to be spun around

You go down, down, down
I fall out of love with you
Come back round, round, round
You sun of a gun
You go low, low, low
This time I won't save you
When you go, go, go
You sun of a gun
You sun of a gun

Grey sky creepin, disappearing
Bye, bye feeling
Heart you're stealing

You go down, down, down
I fall out of love with you
Come back round, round, round
You sun of a gun
You go down, down, down
This time I won't save you
When you drown, drown, drown
You sun of a gun
You sun of a gun
You sun of a gun
