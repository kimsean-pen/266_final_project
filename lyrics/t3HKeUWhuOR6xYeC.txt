Everytime you're broken hearted, sinking in the sorrow
Feel the emptiness and have no faith, no strength to breathe
I wanna tell you it's gonna be better
You've got a greatness within you

Beyond the fear, let's build the bridge
From heart to heart, in the name of love

Everytime you struggle with a fear about tomorrow
Call the angels for the guidance and find another way
I wanna tell you it's gonna be better
You've got a greatness within you

Beyond the fear, let's build the bridge
From heart to heart, in the name of love
Beyond the fear, let's build the bridge
From heart to heart, in the name of love

In the name of love
In the name of love

Beyond the fear, let's build the bridge
From heart to heart, in the name of love
Beyond the fear, let's build the bridge
From heart to heart, in the name of love
