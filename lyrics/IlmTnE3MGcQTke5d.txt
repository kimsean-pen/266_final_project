Oh, you were born with the sun
And oh, you will die with the moon
And everything you thought you had, you lost
But now, you'd never lose what you don't have
Prayers from above, never answered quite enough
Now the only one you have is

You, with this cruel and bitter heart
You were cold and in love, left here naked in the sun
Run, scared, from this cruel and bitter world
This has only begun, as the bombs are bursting on

Smoke arose on azimuth glares, bodies brood in frigid winter air
Where families' sons are robbed beneath their feet, and hearts concede
"Ab ovo," the angel sings, "Ad astra"; our eyes to the sea
We thought that we had a cause for suffering
And reason enough to die alone

Oh, but you, with this cruel and bitter heart
You were cold and in love, left here naked in the sun
Run, scared, from this cruel and bitter world
This has only begun, as the bombs are bursting on

With our feet beneath us, with our hands to the sky
We extend our limbs begging "why oh why?"
Don't turn away!

Prayers from above, never answered quite enough
Looking up never offered you too much
Now the only one you have is...
