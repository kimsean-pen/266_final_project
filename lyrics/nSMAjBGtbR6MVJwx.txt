The hate, you feed me
And the pain
See the hate

At the start, you thought you knew me like that
Then you saw, that I won't do it like that
We went far, but now we back at the start
Times are wastin'
Now she know me oh too well
She know me more than I know myself
I don't know what it is, but I'm looking for something
You wanna try, I'll need your help

Spent lot of time on the boulevard
I've been looking for light, but now I'm stuck in the dark
I was almost dead at the end, now I'm back at the start
Times are wastin'
Never care about a thing, you hate me
Young boy had a dream, I chased it
You used to tell me that you love me
But you faked it
I can never feel the same
But I'm straight
You see the hate, it feed me
And the pain, gonna leave me
To the fame, I don't want that
You're so strange, that it haunts me

At the start, you thought you knew me like that
Then you saw, that I won't do it like that
We came far, but now we back at the start
Times are wastin'
Now she know me oh too well
She know me more than I know myself
I don't know what it is, but I'm looking for somethin'
You wanna try, I'll need your help

You see the hate, it feed me
And the pain, gonna lead me
To the fame, I don't want that
You're so strange, that it haunts me
