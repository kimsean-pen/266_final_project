The kids will make it happen
we're starting a new way
people
in the world today
physically strong
morally straight
positive youth
we"re the youth of today
never fight each other
use our heads before our fists
then we'll kick down all the barriers
of hate and prejudice
live fast die young was just a fad,
for a bunch of losers
who didn"t take care.
i'm gonna live my life,
breath every breath,
look towards the future
and move straight ahead.
