I'll take an ear to feed the pigs
I'll bleed them all just to get my fix
A hooker's scream heard round the world
My sharpened knife begs to explore

The N.Y.P.D. ain't got shit on me
I'll carve them up with a flick of my wrist
You'll never find a fucking fingerprint
I'll run this world, I'll lie and steal
None can match my scalpel skill

The N.Y.P.D ain't got shit on me
No rest, no rest, no fucking arrests
I'll paint this town blood red tonight
Erase this scum from my fucking sight

I'll take an ear to feed the pigs
I'll bleed them all just to get my fix
A hooker's scream heard around the world
My sharpened knife begs to explore

The N.Y.P.D. ain't got shit on me
I'll carve them up with a flick of my wrist
You'll never find a fucking fingerprint
I'll rule this world as I lie and steal
None can match my scalpel's skill

The N.Y.P.D. ain't got shit on me
No rest, no rest, no rest, no fucking arrests
I'll paint this town blood red tonight
Erase this scum from my fucking sight

Kill the fucking lights.

A gift from god doing the devil's crimes
I set shit right one whore at a time

A gift from god doing the devil's crimes
I'll carve these bitches one slice at a time

A gift from god doing the devil's crimes
I set shit right one whore at a time

A gift from god doing the devil's crimes
I'll carve these bitches one slice at a time

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

You'd better catch me before I have my fun.
