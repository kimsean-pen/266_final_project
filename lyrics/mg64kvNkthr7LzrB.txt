(Oh)

I woke up today in a very simple way
In the morning all i could do was sing
I was thinking of things the blue ocean brings
The way it glows, the way it always knows
That when you lose something like a golden diamond ring
You will know that it will show the way the ocean always knows

(oh)

yes, i understand i cannot live on this land
But does that truly mean i have seen all that can be seen?
As for now i will stay in the oven i will bake
As you sit down to pray into the river i will wade
I woke up today in a very simple way
I woke up today in a very simple way
I woke up today in a very simple way
I woke up today in a very simple way
