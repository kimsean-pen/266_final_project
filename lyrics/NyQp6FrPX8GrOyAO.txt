You've heard it once before
It's only up from here
Doubt way down with force
We do all that we can
Yes we do
That's all you need
Keep movin', keep swimmin', keep breathin'
I know you think judgement's made
There's no looking down here
Ignore the weight of the wall
'Cuz it's only up from here
You'll go to the place you ride
And love like you've always loved
Yes you have
That's all you need
Keep movin', keep swimmin', keep breathin' (oooh)
Keep movin', keep swimmin', keep breathin' (oooh)
Keep movin', keep swimmin', keep breathin' (oooh)
Keep movin', keep swimmin', keep breathin'
