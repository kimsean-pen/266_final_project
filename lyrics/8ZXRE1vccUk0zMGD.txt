Let's be anyone but us tonight
Trade this heavy cage of bones for flight

Oh, what a noise we'll make
Drowning out our mistakes, we can't erase
This is the chance we take
We shout until our bones break, we can't replace

Are we now what we'll be?
Are we fixed or free?
Are we now what we'll be?
Are we fixed or free?

Let's be anyone but you and me today
Trade this heavy cage of bones for flight

And when the sirens reach out for us
We'll be far away
And when the sirens reach out for us
We'll be far away

Oh, what a noise we'll make
Drowning out our mistakes, we can't erase
This is the chance we take
We shout until our bones break, we can't replace

Are we now what we'll be?
Are we fixed or free?
Are we now what we'll be?
Are we fixed or free?
