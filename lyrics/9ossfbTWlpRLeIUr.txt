Hidden message in a commentary
back stroke needed more than mostly leaks
In and out of an inner peace
to the light

Closer to it than I've ever been
More tremendous than I have seen
I want it all, all
Come on with me for the ride

It could take all our time
all in a moment's time
Everyone comes to learn
all in our moment

Heaven's entrance and I'm on the verge
Heaven threw me with no concern
I want it all,
I wanna know how, to keep this place in my heart

Closer to it than I've ever been
Closer to it than I've ever been
Am I closer to it than I've ever been, in my life

It could take our whole time
All in a moment's time
Everyone comes to learn
all in a moment's time

It could take our whole time
all in a moment's time
Everyone comes to learn
all in a moment's time

'cause with that which can't begin
to that which has no end
and they both could be the case
that these dreams could never replace
hey, hey
hey, hey
hey, hey

Ah ha ha
