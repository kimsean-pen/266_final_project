Marry me, marry me, mmm
Marry me, marry me, mmm
I don't need a cake, a fancy wedding's not for me

Wanna give you my whole life
And you love me
You say you want me as your wife

And they say, "keep your heart safe"
But I can't, I can't wait, no
Yeah, they say, "keep your heart safe"
But I can't wait

Won't you marry me, marry me?

And I don't need a cake
A fancy wedding's not for me

And that's one thing
You swear you'll never do

I can't be without you
