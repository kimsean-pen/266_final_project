This is why events unverve me
They find it all, a different story
Notice whom for wheels are turning
Turn again and turn towards this time
All she asks the strength to hold me
Then again the same old story
World will travel, oh so quickly
Travel first and lean towards this time
Oh, i'll break them down, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, its got to be this time
Watching her, this things she said
The times she cried
Too frail to wake this time
Oh, i'll break them down, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, its got to be this time
Avenues all lined with trees
Picture me and then you start watching
Watching forever
Watching love grow, forever
Letting me know, forever
