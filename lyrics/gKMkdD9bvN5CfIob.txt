Yeah, yeah, yeah

When you see me
Better make a phone call
'Cause I'm a bad brained gravel gone fiend with no time at all
But just know that I'll drive so
When I deposit your body in the gulf coast, darlin, tomorrow

There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of time
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of time

Through the legend of the river can he beg for it

Up in a basement
But I'm wearin' bubble
I'm glad it high heel don't give fuel to the bubble
Take, take, take, take
I better go play into metal
Heat it up, melt it down into a soup and help you to swallow

There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of time
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of time

Through the legend of the river can he beg for it

Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of,
It's just a matter of,
It's just a matter of time
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of,
It's just a matter of,
It's just a matter of time
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of,
It's just a matter of,
It's just a matter of time
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of,
It's just a matter of,
It's just a matter of time
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of,
It's just a matter of,
It's just a matter of time
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of,
It's just a matter of -
