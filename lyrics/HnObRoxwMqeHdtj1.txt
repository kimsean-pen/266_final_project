I've got nothing in my head, got a floor for a bed
My future's at the bottom of a teacup
I've got a half a pair of shoes, and no time to lose
I'm wondering when I'm going to wise up

So fortune shine your light on me and my nose
'Cause we need some security
You get a little bad luck and it grows and it grows
I'm the black sheep of the family

I've got half a pound of rice, a beard full of lice
A mission called retrogression
I've got a pocket full of dust, and eating is a must
If you want to make a good impression

So fortune shine your light on me and my dog
'Cause we need some security
While other folks are living high on the hog
I'm the black sheep of the family

Don't talk to me about society
You got to play by the rules or pay the penalty
Because there's nothing to choose between a handful of blues
Double indemnity

All the words are wrong, and my shadow's getting long
I realise this song don't mean much
I got an ache in my head, and want to go to bed
Tomorrow I don't have to wake up, no

So wisdom shine your light on me and my knees
'Cause it's true what they say about familiarity
There's nothing good this way, it's true what they say
I'm the black sheep of the family

Oh my, wisdom shine your light on me and my knees
It's true what they say about familiarity
There's nothing good this way, it's true what they say
I'm the black sheep of the family

I'm the black sheep of the family
Just me and my dog, yeah
I'm the black sheep of the family
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah
I'm the black sheep of the family
You got me on my knees
I'm the black sheep of the family
Yeah, yeah, yeah
