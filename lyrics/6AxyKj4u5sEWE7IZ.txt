Cant you see that its just raining
Ain't no need to go outside...
But Baby, You hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep ya
From doing what your supposed to
Like waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
I'll make you banana pancakes
Pretend like its the weekend now

And we could pretend it all the time
Cant you see that its just raining
Ain't no need to go outside

But just maybe, hala ka ukulele
Mama made a baby
Really don't mind the practice
Cause your my little lady
Lady, lady, love me
Cause I love to lay here lazy
We could close the curtains
Pretend like there's no world outside

And we could pretend it all the time
Cant you see that its just raining
Ain't no need to go outside
Ain't no need, ain't no need, mmmm mmmmm
Can't you see, can't you see
Rain all day
And I don't mind.
The telephone is singing
Ringing its too early
Don't pick it up
We don't need to we got everything
We need right here
And everything we need is enough
Just so easy
When the whole world fits inside of your arms
Don't really need to pay attention to the alarm
Wake up slow, mmmm mmmmm, wake up slow
You hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep ya
From doing what your supposed to
Like waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
I'll make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now

And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that its just raining
Ain't no need to go outside
Ain't no need, ain't no need
Rain all day and I really, really, really don't mind
Can't you see, can't you see?
You gotta wake up slow
