Gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)

Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life, by not being mine

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
‘Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment that I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence of you touching my hand in the darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single… that's honestly worse
‘Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)

Ocean blue eyes, lookin' in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
‘Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy, it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad
You make me so happy, it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats…
Alone.
…Unless you want to come along?

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
‘Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy, it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy, it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad
You're gorgeous
