Will you come a little closer
I've got something to show ya
Look at my friend in California
She really likes the freckles on my face

Won't you come and hold my hand now
I think that you might wanna
Do you ever listen to Madonna?
Yeah I really like the freckle on her face

If I think that you might like me
I might start getting lonely
When I think about how you can't hold me
Do you like the freckles on my face

And if I take you to a movie
Things might get groovy
Oh but don't start thinking you can fool me
Yeah I know you like the freckles on my face

I think I love you but then I think
No way!
I gotta go but I wanna stay
Just stay!
I guess I'll save it for another day, well OK?
I think I love you but then I think
No way!
I gotta go but I wanna stay
Just stay!
I guess I'll save it for another day, well ok?

Will you come a little closer

Check out this band from California
I can make you a playlist of their songs

Won't you come and hold me close now
I think that you might wanna
But don't tell anyone don't need no drama
Then we can move it right along

I think I love you but then I think
No way!
You gotta go but I wanna stay
Just stay!
I guess I'll save it for another day, well ok?

I think I love you but then I think
No way!
I gotta go but I wanna stay
Just stay!

I get mixed up in my head, you do too
But I don't forget a thing you've said
Well that's true
Yeah, that's true
So hard to enjoy the time that you're in
Cause when it starts getting comfortable
Yeah it's ending
Yeah, it's ending

I think I love you but then I think
No way!
I gotta go but I wanna stay
Just stay!
I guess I'll save it for another day, well ok?
