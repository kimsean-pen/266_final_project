Damn, I think about you all the time
And I said damn, I wish I could make you mine
But you don't need to be "somebody's"
Cause you're already somebody
No need to be somebody's
Because you're already somebody

Damn, I look into your big blue eyes
And I said damn, if I were a millionaire I'd buy all your lies
Babe I wanna party with you every night
And have a hard-on for the rest of my life
Baby when we're dancing and you're making me smile
You make the trouble all seem worth while
You don't need to be somebody's
Cause you're already somebody
Somebody

Damn, I thought you were gonna be my man
And I said damn, If you can't love me maybe nobody can
But I don't need to be somebody's
Because I'm already somebody
Don't need to be somebody's
Because I'm already somebody
I'm somebody
Somebody
