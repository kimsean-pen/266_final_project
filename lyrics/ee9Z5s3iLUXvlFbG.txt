Soldier, It doesn't matter, what they say, what they do
Stronger, you betta be stronger, do what I say, not what I do
Gung-ho, gung-ho

DJ drop the beat and don't stop
DJ drop the beat and don't stop
DJ drop the beat and don't stop

Hey you, dirty skin, it's time to get back on the ring
I don't wanna miss a thing
No I don't wanna feel a thing
Dig your father fucking grave
slay that mother fucker slave
(I'm not gonna look away)
Gung-ho!

DJ drop the beat and don't stop
DJ drop the beat and don't stop

Freedom glides onto your blade
You've lost a light and fooled your head

I've got a lotta magma running into my veins
Round 1 knock'em down down
I've got a lotta cadaveraz painted over my skin
Round 2 bam! give it away!

I CAN'T GIVE IT AWAY!!!
(HEY YOU BREAK THAT PRICK, EVERYBODY NEEDS SOME BLOODY SHIT)
I CAN'T GIVE IT AWAY!!!
(HEY YOU BREAK THAT PRICK, EVERYBODY NEEDS SOME BLOODY SHIT)

I'M SLEUP'DOWN TODAY, BUT I REALY CAN'T GIVE IT AWAY
I'M SLEUP'DOWN TODAY, BUT I REALY CAN'T GIVE IT AWAY

Hey ya litta cramé, when I look into your eyes
I see nada eyes at all
(DJ drop the beat and don't stop)
Hey ya litta cramé, when I listen ta your voice
I hear nada thing at all
(DJ drop the beat and don't stop)

It makes me think that I might have been wilder than I wanted
With your teeny-body-bonzo
(DJ drop the beat and don't stop)
It makes me wonder mucho did it I really wanna go
Loco violent and funky? hey hey?
Did I really need to go ... gung ho?
(I can't give it away gung ho ...)
