Dim the lights and sleep
Night has brought me here
You're falling far too deep
You're awake when I am near
My soul has lost this fight
I'm no longer on my own

Old companions ride tonight

Cold pale dawn
Defining the spirit alive at last
The sign of the fall
The burden upon me
The very last call

We're passing time my dear
The air is thick with all my fears
You know I wish you all the best
I'll put you here so you can rest
