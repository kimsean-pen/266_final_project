Said you wanna be a better man
Said you folding with a losing hand
You think it's too hard for me to understand
You don't notice me, you don't know it's me

Who bleeds the same as you do?
Who feels the suffering too?
I'm just as broken
But you don't see the truth
So you'll never sympathize
You say your love is a lie
If that's what it is

I want it with you
I want it with you
You, you, you, you

How can you still be a stranger to me?
Only know you through this intimacy
And every riddle that I hear on repeat
Do you lie to me when you lay with me?
