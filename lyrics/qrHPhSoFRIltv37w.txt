The ground from you from sea
But now not so green, the tender of my sea
The ground beneath my feet, the earth so soft and sweet
Tells me our hearts will still meet

Lie for me, lie down
Sink beneath the cold ground
Lie for me, lie down
Sink beneath the cold ground
Lie for me, lie down
Sink beneath the cold ground
The cold ground

Why you leave me out there to show all the new things
The new views that have grown itself, I see from below
The new walls that you tend and you made a home
Over stone, seed and sew
If I see life and threaten return below
Give something else another go
Give something else another go
Give something else another go
Give something else another go

The ground from you from sea
But now not so green, the tender of my sea
The ground beneath my feet, the earth so soft and sweet
Tells me our hearts will still meet

Leaves to greens, green to be
Summer's green as green can be
Leaves to greens, green to be
Summer's green as green can be
Leaves to greens, green to be
Summer's green as green can be
Leaves to greens, green to be
Summer's green as green can be

Leaves to greens, green to be
Summer's green as green can be
Leaves to greens, green to be
Summer's green as green can be
Leaves to greens, green to be
Summer's green as green can be
Leaves to greens, green to be
Summer's green as green can be
