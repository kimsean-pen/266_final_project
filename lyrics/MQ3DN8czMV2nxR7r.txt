would you like to meet the villain somewhere
underneath the skull of a moon.
fire burned his eyes out
cause his chains are too long for you.
someone has to pay for the damage done. no-one's gonna love you now.
your whole family's splintered, you're a slave to it all now.

ooooo ahhhhh
oh, you're a slave to it all now
you're a slave

welcome down to paradise rock. there is no single entrance,
with the stars to revolve around,
there is no real underground
no stars to revolved around
here, they're fashioning the noose
sickened by the knell of the graveyard bell
you know it's not long for you.
sick of all the vomit childhood,
not a trampoline of the freaks,
not even a slave to your father.
oh, you're a slave to it all, now,
oh, you're a slave to it all, now.

welcome down to paradise rock.
there is no single entrance,
with the stars to revolve around,
there is no real underground
there is not a single entrance
there's no stars to revolve around
there is no real underground.
you're a slave to it all, now.

happy, happy, happy.
happy, happy, happy, happy.
