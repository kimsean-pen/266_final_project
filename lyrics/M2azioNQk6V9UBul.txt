Please, believe
Falling for you was wrong
When the fallen picture frame is on the wall
Don't ever look to do
Please, believe me
I never knew it was wrong

Oh, it's only you
Was hard to move, to see your face and then it's gone again
Oh, its only you
Even if we don't make it

Oh, I know
Those who go high can fall
She was everything I wanted and that was all
No need to know what to do

Swear to God
I swear to God
All for God

Please, believe me
I never knew it was wrong

Oh it's only you
Was hard to move, to see your face and then it's gone again
Oh, it's only you it's hard to go another way, and let you by again

Oh but yes I'lll always roam
I don't wanna die and stay for more

Oh it's only you
Was hard to move, to see your face and then it's gone again
Oh, it's only you, even if we don't make it
Oh it's only you
Was hard to move, to see your face and then you're gone again
Oh, it's only you
It's hard to go another way and then goodbye again
