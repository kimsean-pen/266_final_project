How many secrets you have
That keep you smiling that way
You better start to behave

And how many scars that you don't share
Oh why do I care?
Still I can smell that something failed

And you robbed that map just to run away
And that car but "don't turn off the lights yet"
You know that you're afraid

And I feel like I'm freezing again
You won't say you're bored anymore
'Cause I can take you dancing
Use me to feel home
It's the same old story of a bad boy
Give me the keys and I'll...

And how many times did you come
Until I'll found you in this dirty spot
I can tell, I can tell that something failed

And you needed money
show me the game - show me the rules again
Because I'll play it, I'll play it
I'll take it now

And I feel like I'm freezing again
You won't say you're bored anymore
'Cause I can take you dancing
Use me to feel home

And I feel like I'm freezing again
You won't say you're bored anymore
'Cause I can take you dancing
Use me to feel home
It's the same old story of a bad boy
Give me the keys
And I'll show you how to fight for more
