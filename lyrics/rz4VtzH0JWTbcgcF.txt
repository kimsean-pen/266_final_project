It's hard to stay mad at you
When you look like that
When you move like that so
Give me that attitude
And I'ma give it right back
Make the tension last like

Oh my, oh my God
You the baddest
We go on and on and on
I just about had it
I don't wanna come across as too dramatic
But I'ma die if I don't have it

We're on that sexual vibe
You got me on that wave
I'm only here for the night
So tell me what's the play
I'm under your influence
When you're on top
You know that I'm listening
Tell me what you want
We're on that sexual vibe, yeah

That sexual vibe, yeah

Your effort so effortless, yeah
So don't move too fast
'Cause I like it when you...
Fuck with me reckless
And I'ma give it right back
Make the tension last like

Oh my, oh my God
You the baddest
We go on and on and on
Just like a habit
I know all them other dudes, yeah, they were average
But that's fine 'cause they was practice

We're on that sexual vibe
You got me on that wave
I'm only here for the night
So tell me what's the play
I'm under your influence
When you're on top
You know that I'm listening
Tell me what you want
We're on that sexual vibe, yeah

That sexual vibe, yeah

Yeah, we could take it slow
Teach me things I didn't know
That sexual vibe
It's building up for show
All this tension, let it go

We're on that sexual vibe
I'm only here for the night
I'm under your influence when you're on top
You know that I'm listening tell me what you want

We're on that sexual vibe
You got me on that wave
I'm only here for the night
So tell me what's the play
I'm under your influence
When you're on top
You know that I'm listening
Tell me what you want
We're on that sexual vibe
Yeah

We're in that sweet spot
Baby, just don't stop
That sexual vibe
