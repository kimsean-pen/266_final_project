You don't know a thing about magic
Kid, your plants won't work as meds
Everybody cheats, your saint's a czar
Now your country's dead
In my arms

You Mother Earth motherfucker
You had it all but you lost it
And now you've come to cleanse yourself

So I feed the game
Heal the sky
And grow with rain
Everybody knows me
Even men
Who never lie
Strip me down
When I'm naked, end of times

You don't know a thing about magic
Have you ever had a moment's doubt?
Grab your hippie shit
And get out

You Mother Earth motherfucker
You had it all but you lost it
Now watch me get the beating belt

The messiah goes!
Hang him now!
Give his blood
To the cows

Get the messiah fired!
Crush the bones
And feed the ground

Like I feed the game
Heal the sky
And grow with rain
Everybody knows me
Even men
Who beat their wives
Strip me down
When I'm naked, end of times

Keeping my poise in the casket
Here in Manaus we don't take shit
Keeping my poise in the casket
Here in Manaus we don't take shit
Keeping my poise in the casket
Here in Manaus we don't take shit
Keeping my poise-

When your neighbors backpack
Tell 'em some facts
The fish will eat both their feet

When the leaders all drown
Show them my crown
The Mother won't spare the meek

The messiah goes!
Hang him now!
Give his blood
To the cows

Get the messiah fired!
Crush the bones
And feed the ground

So I feed the game
Heal the sky
And grow with rain
Everybody knows me
Even men
Who never lie
Strip me down
When I'm naked, end of times
