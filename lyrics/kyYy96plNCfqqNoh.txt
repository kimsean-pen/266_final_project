No waiting, No running
No searching behind
I will take you time
I will break you mine
Waiting is a crime

All will be now
Dreams are too fast
You are the first
We are the last

No sequence to follow
No fear of tomorrow
Kiss of neverness
Life of timelessness
We'll break the speed of change
We'll tame eternity

Time is within you
Shine through your eyes
We'll kill the word
Black letter lies
Lies lies lies lies lies
Your world is built on lies
