You made mistakes, I make regrets
I get a high when you break your neck
I get a piece of mind when I squeeze the lime
I'm ready to come once you've sobered up
Calamari rings and a panorama truck
Santana sings with the band that I want
I can find you and no I won't tell no one
I can find you

Ride with me, take some time, get you far
Then get high with me
Ride with me, ain't no one on the side
Do or die for me
Ride with me, take some time, get you far
Then get high with me
Ride with me, ain't no one on the side
Do or die (do or die)

We move so fast, I'm ripping apart
So fucked up, I glow in the dark
Let's go to sleep and never wake up
Here's a [?] to speak from the heart
This back and fourth is stuck on repeat
Just get me drunk and I'll suck on your feet
And once your heart is not what it seems
I'll wash it out, you just gotta breathe

Just ride with me, take some time, get you far
Then get high with me (high with me)
Ride with me, ain't no one on the side
Do or die for me

Because when it goes
We only fuck on the low
So we don't decide
We have nothing to hide

You made mistakes, I make regrets
I get a high when you break your neck
I get a piece of mind when I squeeze the lime
I'm ready to come once you've sobered up
Calamari rings and a panorama truck
Santana sings with the band that I want
I can find you and no I won't tell no one
I can find you
