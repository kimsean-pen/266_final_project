My insides are turning inside out
Leaving my heart, my flaws all hanging out
What's so interesting about little ol me
All I see inside is so ordinary

I can't look at myself
I can't find nothing special hiding in me
I can't look at myself
U tell me it's there to see but all i see is so ... ugly

It's not like I'd put a gun to my head
I really try to listen to all you've said
If I could only sleep a long while
Maybe tomorrow I'll feel a speck worthwhile

I can't look at myself
I can't find nothing special hiding in me
I can't look at myself
U tell me it's there to see but all i see is so

I'm lucky to have a liar as good as you
I wish I could feel as good as you do
So I'll follow your lead
Hoping to see something good in me

I can't look at myself
I can't find nothing special hiding in me
I can't look at myself
U tell me it's there to see but all I see is so ... ugly

My insides are turning inside out
Leaving my heart, my flaws all hanging out
