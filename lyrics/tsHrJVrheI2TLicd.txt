She is a window and she is an arrow
She is a line in the sand
She is the ocean, that breathless commotion
That carries you far from dry land
She is the sunlight, that wicked blue moonlight,
The star to my wandering bark
She is the melody to my sad symphony
She is the way through the dark

She'll tip you over and she'll drag you under
And she'll sing that love is a fire
She is a mystery, my heart's wounded history
And she is the hardest goodbye

She is a lesson that I learned the hard way
She's a long distance call
She is a casualty of my uncertainty
She's a brick wall
She's an obsession and she's an addiction
That I thought I had beat
She's a confession and she's a temptation
That walks by on the street

She is my skin holding my blood in
And covering my bones
She is my meaning, the crutch I've been leaning on
She is my own

She is a lifetime of strangers and friends
I know someday she'll stay by my side
