There really is nothing nice about U.S.A.
You go to the hospital, you have to pay
The dollar is the language that they all speak
They don't really bother about radiation leak

Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S. (U.S.A.)
Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S. (U.S.A.)
Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S. (U.S.A.)
Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S.A.

They keep their secrets undercover
The rich don't bother about those that suffer
This ain't land of milk and honey
'Cause all they want is money, money, money

Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S. (U.S.A.)
Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S. (U.S.A.)
Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S. (U.S.A.)
Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S.A.

Nuclear bombs are fuck all new
You'd better start running when they drop on you
Run into a shelter, play hide-and-seek
'Cause when you die your body reeks

Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S. (U.S.A.)
Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S. (U.S.A.)
Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S. (U.S.A.)
Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S.A.

There really is nothing nice about U.S.A.
You go to the hospital, you have to pay
The dollar is the language that they all speak
They don't really bother about the radiation leak

Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S. (U.S.A.)
Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S. (U.S.A.)
Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S. (U.S.A.)
Fuck the U.S.A., fuck the U.S.A.
