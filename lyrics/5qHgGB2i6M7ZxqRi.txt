Make your circles out of salt
It's never quite your fault
And the night's come washing me

And break about your [?]
And a roses turning black again

And time it heals like the wine
And going from my kind then

Tear it from my heart
Tear it from my heart
Tear it from my heart
Again...

Tear it from my heart
The venture cause we pulls apart
The [?]
Simply to see where the blood will flow

And you hope
That pieces that cut through the night
They're various moment to blind
As I open my arms to the depths below

Tear it from my heart
Tear it from my heart
Tear it from my heart
