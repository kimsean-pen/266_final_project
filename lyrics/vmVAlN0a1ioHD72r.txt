I was drinking in the daylight
I was looking for a way to tell you
That without you I don't feel right
Killing myself just to understand you
Killing myself just to understand you

Holding up for you but you gave me no sign
Holding up for you, am I wasting my time?
You know I don't regret when I said too much
But I'm hating myself when I come undone

It's a sad dream
It's a sad song
To remind me
But I'm singing along
It's a sad dream
It's a sad song
To remind me
But I'm singing along

I'll make it easy for you, baby
Remove myself from your equation
I've been overthinking lately (I've been overthinking lately)
I've been overthinking lately

I need to chill myself, can we take a drive?
Keeping it quiet in the middle of the night
Come a little closer, put your hands on me
You know I lose my mind thinking of you in the backseat

It's a sad dream
It's a sad song
To remind me
But I'm singing along
It's a sad dream
It's a sad song
To remind me
But I'm singing along

How could I see you with anyone but me?
How could I see you with anyone but me?
How could I see you with anyone but me?
How could I see you with anyone?

It's a sad dream
It's a sad song
To remind me
But I'm singing along
It's a sad dream
It's a sad song
To remind me
But I'm singing along

I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
