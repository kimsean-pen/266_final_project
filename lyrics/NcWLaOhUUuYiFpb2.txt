Don't fall into my arms
Don't ask me to repeat it
Don't suffocate my heart
I don't know what I'm feeling

Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk it through
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you

Don't ask me
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk it through
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you

Don't fall into my arms
I'll only disappoint you
I'll let you down
Don't go soundin' the alarms
When all I do is want you

So don't ask me
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk it through
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you

Don't ask me
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk it through
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you

Let me wake up heavy head
Lying in my bed with you naked
Go put that song on, that you love
On repeat, until we can't take it
I wanna' drink pink lemonade
Watching movie trailers 'til it's late
And let's remember all the words
That we think are gonna make our hearts break

Don't ask me
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk it through
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you

Don't ask me
Do you wanna talk
Do you wanna talk it through
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you

(Thinking of you)
(I'm just thinking of you)
(Thinking of you)
(Thinking of you)
(Thinking of you)
(I'm just thinking of you)
(Thinking of you)

I'm protected, I'm protected
I'm protected, to what I don't wanna' have to say

I'm protected, I'm protected
I'm protected, 'cause I don't wanna walk away

(You)
(Thinking of you)
(I'm just thinking of you)
(Thinking of you)
