I see it in your eyes, it's all been gone
No matter what we've lost, it's running dry
You're fading way too fast, the truth you can't deny
You see it in my eyes, what can you say?
No matter how it ends, are you okay?
I'm swimming way too deep, I guess it's done

Oh can't you see, can't you see?

I didn't lose my patience laying on your shelf
What happened to your touch? I barely feel myself
If you still hear me, you is all I need
'Cause I'm so lonely, I'm that falling leaf

What do you know about the way I feel?
It's rumoured to the core, I guess it's real
Man, we're just bulletproof, we're made of steel
I guess when you gave up, I found a way
'Cause this is how it is, blood through my veins
Did you ever found a place to hide from their eyes?

Oh can't you see, can't you see?

I didn't lose my patience laying on your shelf
What happened to your touch? I barely feel myself
If you still hear me, you is all I need
'Cause I'm so lonely, I'm that falling leaf

When that black cloud of anxiety
Keeps you a lonely company
And it drowns you in your dreams
And it tears you at your fucking seams
Just look at me
It's such a shame it took the end to set me free

I didn't lose my patience laying on your shelf
What happened to your touch? I barely feel myself
If you still hear me, you is all I need
'Cause I'm so lonely, I'm that falling leaf
