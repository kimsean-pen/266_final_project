I'm comin' home to you, wear something see-through
So I can see your heart
For night can never come soon enough for me
I watch the sky all day

Night is where I find you and peace of mind
My days are filled with grief
That's why I truly give you what you need
Because you love me for me

Good runs all through you, I can't help myself
You found my weakest spot
What better woman to breathe and sleep next to
That's why I'll always be with you

Yes, I'm funny like a clown, but I'm never down
As long as you're around
There will never be a normal way for me
'Cause you are shinin' beneath me

You'll never have to beg me to come to bed
I'll walk you there each night
If you want me to that's what I will do
That's why I'll always be with you
