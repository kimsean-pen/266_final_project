Baby please, be all mine
No one loves you like me
You know I ain't lying
I'm asking you
Baby, to please belong to me

I know some people like to share their love (alright!)
But you know I could never get enough (tonight!)
I need 100% of you baby, at least
I know you like to keep your options open (alright!)
I understand and all, but I was hoping (tonight!)
You'd reconsider your policy on account of me

I got this feeling you were made for me
Made for me baby
Got this funny feeling you were made for me

I got this feeling you were made for me
Made for me baby
Got this funny feeling you were made for me

Baby please, be all mine
Ain't like I'm asking you to go do hard time
I'm down on my knees
Baby, please belong to me

I know I'm not the only boy you like (it's true!)
Maybe I'm not even a boy you like (true too!)
Let's not get hung up on technicalities, babydoll
I know that you've got your own life to live (alright!)
I know you've got plenty of love to give (tonight!)
I was thinking if you were down
Maybe I could have it all?

I got this feeling you were made for me
Made for me baby
Got this funny feeling you were made for me

I got this feeling you were made for me
Made for me baby
Got this funny feeling you were made for me

Baby please, be all mine
Ain't like I'm asking you to go do hard time
I'm down on my knees
Baby, please belong to me

Baby, please belong to me
Please be all mine, all of the time
Please belong to me

Please be mine all mine
Baby, please be mine all mine
Please be mine all mine
