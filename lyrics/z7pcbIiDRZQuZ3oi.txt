I only play for money, honey
Look at what this fun has done to me
It has me gunning for the country
Sky's memory and moonless
Vision copied from the bootlegs
We are out of tune so mostly tuneless

For a fee I'll fight any foe
For a fee I'll take it and go

I'll only play if [?]
Only when my lips are moving
You've been careful here to keep the tempo
Only play with money, careful
Not to trigger some reversal
And to live by an obscure example

For a fee I'll fight any foe
For a fee I'll stop any show

I know, depending on you to get this right
Depending on you to climb these heights
Depending on you, it's pay per view

Pick the path of least resistance
Over the hills and out of wisdom
And just when I thought we beat the system
I knew a gentle man of leisure
He loved to talk about his treasure
And of how he got it for a song, song, song, song

For a fee I'll right any wrong
For a fee I'll right any wrong
For a fee I'll fight any foe
For a fee I'll stop any show

I know, depending on you to get this right
Depending on you to climb these heights
Depending on you, it's pay per view

Only live for happy endings
[?] we started parting
My affinity for closing clues
Never been an opportunist
I accept the prize if I somehow surprise us all and get there soonest

I only play for money, honey
I only play with money, honey
