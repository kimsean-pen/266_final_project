She tripped on a hole that I'd dug in the soil
To be part of a human garden
I couldn't stand in the straight postured sun
But you stood in the mud
Which came unsoiled when I came along
When I came along, when I came along

So you never stop needing
You never stop needing

A close look at something so close
A close look at something so close
It's too much of not enough
A close look with something so close
A close look at something so close
It's too much of not enough
When all we need is just a taste

I strapped myself in for a safe saccharide
Before we started I tried
To be anything I saw fit
And it all seemed to fit

But you came undone when I came along
When I came along, when I came along

So you never stop needing
You never stop needing

A close look at something so close
A close look at something so close
It's too much of not enough
A close look with something so close
A close look at something so close
It's too much of not enough
When all we need is just a taste

Blind white lies and shallow truth
Broken strings and stolen youth
I've seen too much of not enough but
You came much closer than they had before
You came much closer than they had before
You came much closer than they had before

You never stop needing
You never stop needing
You never stop needing
And it's good for nothing
