That's the place where my house used to stand
Where I learned how to behave
And to be like everyone else

You told me what to say
What sort of clothes to wear
Where to go, not to get lost
And who am I supposed to talk to

And all those moments
Lost like tears in rain
Like my strength
Never to return again
Never to return
