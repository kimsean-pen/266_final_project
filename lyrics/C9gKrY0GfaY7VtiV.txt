I can't stay knowing what's going down
I can't stay, darkness on the edge of town
streetwise kids in an act of defiance
out to defeat what's already behind us
rattle and shake their political cans
giving directions without any plans
there's a new kid on the block
and he's taking my place
walking on my grave

I can't stay staring down a .44
I can't stay dying on the killing floor
a man in blue and he's drawing a gun
a child in the shadows too scared to run
crack on the mirror of a teenage dream
like a lost generation on L.S.D.
There's a new kid on the block
and he's taking my place
walking on my grave

I can't stay knowing what's going down
I can't stay, darkness on the edge of town
the brain's still twitching but the eyes are closed
my best friends dying from an overdose
a red light flares unacounted for
it's happening now and it's happened before
there's a new kid on the block
and he's taken my place
walking on my grave
