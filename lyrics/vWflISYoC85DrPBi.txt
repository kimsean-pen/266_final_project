I can't expect you to be honest
Or to be faithful every day to the end
I just need you to be always a friend
As the sun sets over Dakotas
Underneath the crimson ocean of sky
Know I'll always want you by my side

When we drive
When we drive

You and I were born in motion
Never in one place for too long a time
Now it's the only way we know to survive
I like the way that your hair tangles
The way your suntan's only on one side
You always keep the windows open wide

When we drive
When we drive
When we drive
When we drive

Climb into the back seat and close your eyes
I've got the wheel
Dream of all the places only we will find

I can't expect you to be honest
Or to be faithful every day to the end
I just need you to be always a friend
Until the engine kicks and sputters
Until we roll the rubber off the tires
Know I'll always need you by my side

When we drive
When we drive
When we drive
When we drive
When we drive
When we drive
