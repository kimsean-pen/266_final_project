I still remember you
Hug me like a picture frame
While I'm staring in your eyes
My mind's still in the memory
Turfed like I'm a bulletproof
My heart's playing halo games
No I'm doubting you in my collide
I give you everything

When I try to run away you make me think of fight back
And I don't think that I've ever had a feeling like that
Oh your love is not fiction
It's the realest I've seen
But you don't even know what you're doing to me, yeah

You, you
Don't know you're setting off a fuse, fuse
You make me wanna break the rules
Come put your hands on my piano
You, you
No you ain't got nothing to prove, prove
You got me breaking all the rules, rules
So put your hands on my piano

I feel I wanna lose
Settle how you say my name
Acting like I'm in control
My fault, you're taking over me
Lost baby here's the truth
I'll buy for that in your main
Bodies going in the dark, and art soul that I ever need

When I try to run away you make me think of fight back
And I don't think that I've ever had a feeling like that
Oh your love is not fiction
It's the realest I've seen
But you don't even know what you're doing to me, yeah

You, you
Don't know you're setting off a fuse, fuse
You make me wanna break the rules
Come put your hands on my piano
You, you
No you ain't got nothing to prove, prove
You got me breaking all the rules, rules
So put your hands on my piano

Looking for a way but I can't go
Cause babe I even see you with my eyes closed
Babe I even see you with my eyes closed
Looking for a reason but I got none
Cause secretly I don't think that I want one
Honestly I don't think that I want one
Yeah, yeah

Don't know what you do to

You, you
Don't know you're setting off a fuse, fuse
You make me wanna break the rules
Come put your hands on my piano
You, you
No you ain't got nothing to prove, prove
You got me breaking all the rules, rules
So put your hands on my piano

You, you
Don't know you're setting off a fuse, fuse
You make me wanna break the rules
Come put your hands on my piano
You, you
No you ain't got nothing to prove, prove
You got me breaking all the rules, rules
So put your hands on my piano
