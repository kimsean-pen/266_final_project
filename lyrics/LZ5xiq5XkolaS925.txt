She's been out for a week or a little more
Again and again and again counting all these hours at night
A single cloud is passing by
Right in the moon behind the way she always said
You spin fast in a road that i didn't count?
From time to time it felt like we have chosen different roads
Oh the future is gonna be a new estate for you and me
At least, at least in your eyes
Oh I swear
Down to the upper side I can see ghost towns
Oh until the morning glows
Read it in your eyes I believe in my whole lies
Oh
She's been out for sick and change
In a land where milk and honey flows
Through all our veins
What does an old picture tell
I thought i've always stayed the same
At least in your eyes
Down to the upper side I can see ghost towns
Oh until the morning glows
Read it in your eyes, I believe in my whole lies
Down to the upper side i can see ghost towns
Oh until the morning glows
Read it in your eyes, I believe in my whole lies
Huh
Nothing can hold us
Same way as you can't leave us alone
It's easy one more step and my head is gone
Serena, all I need and all I want you to
Believe me all I need and want you to
Oh i swear
Down to the upper side I can see ghost towns
Oh until the morning glows
Read it in your eyes, I believe in my whole lies
Down to the upper side I can see ghost towns
Oh until the morning glows
Read it in your eyes, I believe in my whole lies
Oh oh
Can't read it in your eyes
In the dead of the night
I can't read it in your eyes
I believe in my whole lies
