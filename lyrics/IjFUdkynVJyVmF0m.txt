Serpents of heaven befall us
Come when temper and lust are awake
Arise from the deep of the battle
And awake when lust can't wait

Send all misgivings to heaven
And unveil all the beasts in your head
Stand tall for the rain
Remember the pain
When in Rome we all attack

Time to see the sky forever
Find eternal life in fever
Time to copulate
And come alive and break the chains

Commit the sacrament of sin - in for the kill
The sacrament of sin - for the sin is my will
Sacrament of sin - believe it or fall
All the night neanderthal

Ten thousand times we have wondered
And prepared for the ultimate sin
Three times had our lord been forgiven
And three times we fell for skin

Ban all the morals to heaven
And forget all good manners in rage
To rebel in lust
In body and bust
Fornicate to break this cage

Time to see the sky forever
Find eternal life in fever
Time to copulate
And come alive to break the chains

Commit the sacrament of sin - in for the kill
The sacrament of sin - for the sin is my will
Sacrament of sin - believe it or fall
All the night neanderthal

Confess the sacrament of sin - mistress or wife
Sacrament of sin - lead a sinister life
Sacrament of sin - desire to call
Stand up high when cloth will fall

Commit the sacrament of sin - in for the kill
The sacrament of sin - for the sin is my will
Sacrament of sin - believe it or fall
All the night neanderthal

Confess the sacrament of sin - mistress or wife
Sacrament of sin - lead a sinister life
Sacrament of sin - desire and call
Stand up high when cloth will fall

Commit the sacrament of sin
