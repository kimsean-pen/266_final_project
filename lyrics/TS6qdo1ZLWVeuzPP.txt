When I woke up, 6 pm,
Sleepin in your bed again,
Your ghost,
Keeps me lonely,
All the while,
I'm burnin for you,
For you,

And this could be,
Just what you need,
Just dim the lights,
Cut your ties,
Break down this line,
The mood is right,
You burn inside of me,
You're burnin' inside of me,
You burn,

And I'm still alive in you,
I'm still alive,
I'm still on fire for you,
It's burnin inside,

No use in thinkin bout it now,
You're gone,
You're gone,
You're gone,
And I'll be what you want,
I'll be what you need,
I can love you more,

So what could be better, she tries to remember,
A time when the weather, was warm enough,
To swim in September, got sick and got better,
By middle November, it tore me up,
The time was just flyin,
I'm tryin, rewindin,
Ask me if I'm lyin,
I'm yellin, you're cryin,
I love you I'm sorry,
Let's drop it my bad,
It's not worth the work we put in what we have,
After that, dysfunction between us was gettin to me,
But maybe dysfunction is just what you need,
And maybe there's comfort in rippin the seams,
You can't reap what you sow til you learn what you teach,
So you left out of spite, and my pride watched you leave,
And conjunction dysfunction was the greatest disease,
The greatest,
The greatest you ever had,
The greatest in the world,

And I'm still alive in you,
I'm still alive,
I'm still on fire for you,
It's burnin inside,

No use in thinkin bout you now,
You're gone,
You're gone,
You're gone,
In you,
And I'll be what you want
