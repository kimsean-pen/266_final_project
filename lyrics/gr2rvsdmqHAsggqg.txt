Dirt on my breath
Blood in my eyes
Thorns in my back
I wanted to be evergreen

So sorry that i gave what you got now you reap what i've sown
(foolish and tired i gave what you got and now you reap what i've sown)
All my leaves like poison to you
I'm yanking the roots

Stop the lies you're telling yourself
I won't get any better for you
I'll love you when i bloom

Please, doctor don't-- i know im alive
Winter's so cold... don't know if i'll be back in spring

So sorry that i gave what you got now you reap what i've sown
(felfish and stupid i broke every promise now you reap what i've sown)
All those trees have plenty of fruit
I got nothing for you

Stop the lies you're telling yourself
I wont get any better for you
I'll love you when i bloom
