You live for times of solace,
within a sign there's a promise.
Don't lose all faith 'cos you shake at night,
it's in the art of the process.

In another rhyme beyond this place,
the healing's fast enough.
Done a thousand times,
a thousand ways, until you've had enough.

It's mercy you're asking for,
cheating life by taking more.
It's mercy you're asking for,
take my life or give me more.

The loss of prize possessions,
to cure the mind's obsessions.
Could trade your soul for that normal life,
elite to all objections.

See beyond all tears and broken years,
your senses giving up.
Lose all confidence at your expense,
your courage swallowed up.

It's mercy you're asking for,
cheating life by taking more.
It's mercy you're asking for,
take my life or give me more.
