Ah, ah, ah... oh yes.
San Francisco, where the flowers bloom in spring.
I said fade to winter and see what disease brings.
Augustino, with his eyes like a shinning sea.
I said he's half a shadow... god don't let that be me.

I'm a Stardog Champion.
I'm a Stardog Champion.

West Virginia, that where my father lies.
He was a war time hero,
The kind that money buys.
Diamond bracelet for my mommy's memory.
I said that's all she wrote for, that's all she wrote for me, yeah.

I'm a Stardog Champion.
I'm a Stardog Champion.
That's right.
And the children, they used to sing of love
With the grace from the lord above.
I said the children, they used to sing out loud.
Sing it loud...

Good god, I'm a Stardog Champion.
I'm a Stardog Champion.
I'm a Stardog, baby
And I ain't gonna let you down, yeah
Ain't gonna let you down.
I'll never let you down...
Let the children sing
Nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nahnahnahnahnowah...
