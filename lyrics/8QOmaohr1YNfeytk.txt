Now I know how to walk it off, man
Wrap it up and heal the wound
I'm feeling everything a little too much
Including you (you)

The gate, the swing, the swag, the hit-the-heel
The stumble - make believe this isn't real
The more you fall
The more you learn to feel

When perception shifts
Expectations give way
I don't know exactly what to call it
But I wouldn't call it pain

I put myself in this position
Let it go (?)
Let me have my way

This is not love (but)
This is not NOT love (but)
This is not love (but)
This is not NOT love (but)

Alright listen: I packed my bags
And I can be there in a day and half
We grew dorsal fins that night in Berlin
Madrid was just to be a distant dream

I know now that you will never make it there with me
I'm a dreamer, I'm a dreamer, I'm a dream
So we paint the sky with stick-on stars
I knew that we had gone too far
I know the rules! I know the rules...

When perception shifts
Expectations give way
I don't know exactly what to call it
But I wouldn't call it pain

I put myself in this position
Let it go off and
Let me have my way

This is not love (but)
This is not NOT love (but)
This is not love (but)
This is not NOT love (but)

This is not this is not (Strut)
This is not not not (Strut)
This is not NOT love (Strut)
