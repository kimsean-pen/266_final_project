Welcome to nowhere fast. Nothing here ever lasts.
Nothing but memories of what never was.

We're nowhere, we're nowhere, we're nowhere to be.
Nowhere, we're nowhere, we're nowhere to see. (to see)

Living makes me sick, so sick I wish I'd die.
Down in the belly of the beast; I can't lie.

You're nowhere, you're nowhere, you're nowhere to be.
Nowhere, you're nowhere, you're nowhere to see. (to see)

There's nothing left to do.
There's nothing left to feel.
Doesn't matter what you want, so.

(Yeah!)

To make yourself feel better,
You make it so you'll never,
Give in to your forevers and live for always.

And forever, forever, you're forever to be.
Forever, forever, you're forever to me. (to me)

(You!)
