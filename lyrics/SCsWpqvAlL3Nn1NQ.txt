Now my dear friend
Now for your sins
You're to suffer
Here it begins
Drag ropes forward
Shame will save you
Out moves inward
Turn of the screw
Gallows free you
Dawn's release
Hood to blind you
Be at peace
I was immortal but I am your friend
To stay and be beside you
Always here and always with you now
(I'm human too)
Lies are manifold and the truth can now be told
Now my dear friend
Now for your sins
You're to suffer
Here it begins
I was immortal but I am your friend ('til the end)
To stay and be beside you
Always here and always with you now
(I grieve for you)
