I was hella broke then
I ain't have a dime
But I was always focused
I ain't waste no time

I ain't have a car in my name
I used to walk to work every day
Me and my dog, back in the night I came out alright

All the homies, we came up the same way
And I swear ain't nothing change
Got a little bit of change in my pocket but I maintain
We were young and in this world chasing dreams and girls
Running from our problems
I know that we older now, but that's what we were all about

I remember we were young
Young and dumb
Some niggas in a rush
I remember we were young
Young and dumb
I remember it was gang over love
That was us

I remember we would cut class
My teachers used to hate me
The only reason that I did that was to keep from going crazy
I didn't give a damn 'bout my grades
That's probably why we failed the ninth grade
Me and my dogs
Like it or not, but we came out okay

All the homies, we came up the same way
And I swear ain't nothing change
Way before I ever moved out the house and did the damn thing
We were young and in this world chasing dreams and girls
Running from our problems
And I know we're older now, but that's what we were all about

I remember we were young
Young and dumb
Some niggas in a rush
I remember we were young
Young and dumb
I remember it was gang over love
That was us
