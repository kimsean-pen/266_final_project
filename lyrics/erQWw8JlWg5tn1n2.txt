Beware, beware, the daughter of the sea
Beware I heard him cry
His words carried, upon the ocean breeze
As he sank beneath the tides
Those blood-soaked shores of Kalimdor
Where sailors fought and died
The admiral fell at Theramore
Because she left his side
Why this, why this, oh daughter of the sea?
Why this, did she forget her seaside days?
Always the pride of our nation's eyes
How could she go astray
When she did flee across the ocean deep
The admiral followed west
What else but sail to save a daughter's life
And pray she still drew breath?
But there he found, upon those distant shores
Enemies on the rise
But when he faced those savage foes
His daughter stood aside
And buried deep beneath the waves
Betrayed by family
To his nation, with his last breath cried
"Beware the daughter of the sea"
I heard, I heard, across the moonlit sea
The old voice warning me
Beware, beware, the daughter of the sea
Beware, beware
Of me
