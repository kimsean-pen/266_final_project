Through all of this I know my fear of staying young is getting old
Getting old
And through all of this I see that everyone's been happy beside me
You're all happy beside me

Adjacent to the trees, the sun cuts through
And shines right down on me
You and me
We were safe and sound it seemed
'Till the clouds came out and swallowed everything
And everyone including me

Through all of this I know my fear of staying young is
getting old So if you want to I'll stay near you if you're scared too

Haven't lived through tragedy,
but I know that every day means everything to me

Through all of this I know my fear of staying young is getting old
(Getting old)
So if you want to I'll stay near you if you're scared too

'Cause I'm scared too

You know that we're getting old and time ain't free
Please don't take another year from me

Through all of this I see that without you there wouldn't be a me
And that's the most beautiful thing

So if you want to, I'll stay near you
I'll stay near you
So if you want to, I'll stay near you
