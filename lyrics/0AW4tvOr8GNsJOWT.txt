I saw your picture
across the room
I knew I had to
have you by noon

We could go dancing
I'll take off your clothes
We can do something
cuz nobody knows

wah wah wah ooo
woah

Now we're together
and you look alright
Now I can hold you
and see you every night

We could go dancing
I'll take off your clothes
We can do something
cuz nobody know

wah wah wah ooo
woah

I should come over and over again
We could be lovers and talk like we're friends
I gotta know you and how you must feel
This is so wonderful its so real.

wah wah wah ooo
woah
