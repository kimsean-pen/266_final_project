Are you alright?, I'm alright, I'm quite alright and my money's right
8...
(Countin' them bands all way to the top, 'til they be fallin' over)
(Countin' them bands, on my way to the top, 'til we fallin' over)

I don't really care if you cry, on the real, you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes, she said: "Baby, I am not afraid to die"

Push me to the edge, all my friends are dead
Push me to the edge, all my friends are dead
Push me to the edge, all my friends are dead
Push me to the edge...

Phantom that's all red, inside all white, like something you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now, everybody got the same swag now, watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the toall the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot, your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over"
I like the way that she treat me, gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah I might blow my brain out
Xanny help the pain, yeah, please, Xanny make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me, all the pain, now I can't feel it, I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah

I don't really care if you cry, on the real, you should've never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes, she said: "I am not afraid to die"
All my friends are dead, push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah, push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah, all my friends are dead, yeah

That is not your swag, I swear you fake hard now these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em, medicine, lil' nigga take some
Fast car, Nascar, race on 'em, in the club, ain't got no ones, then we would become
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes, you is not a G, though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though, I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

She say, "You're the worst; you're the worst", I cannot die because this my universe

I don't really care if you cry, on the real, you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes, she said: "Baby, I am not afraid to die"

Push me to the edge, all my friends are dead
Push me to the edge, all my friends are dead
Push me to the edge, all my friends are dead
Push me to the edge...
