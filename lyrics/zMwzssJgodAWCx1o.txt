For all I know it looks different now
This is my home, this is my home
All the windows look different now
Cause they are not yours, no they are not yours

How to disappear?
I'm just a bird on your bed,
I'll sing when you're sad

How to disappear?
I'm nothing more than a breeze
Can you feel me?

I've got all the dreams inside me now
The dreams of the world, the dreams of the world
But when it's time and the autumn comes,
Let me come home...

How to disappear?
I'm just a bird on your bed,
I'll sing when you're sad

How to disappear?
I'm nothing more then a breeze
Can you feel me?
