I had a little night on the weekend
I was just hanging from the ceiling
I shouldn't have my check up
'Cause no one really knows when it all runs out

And I don't even wild on the weekend
I don't even know if I mean it
See me never never no no no
See me never never no no no no
See me never never no no no no
And you don't have to run up in my bed
No, you don't have to run up in my bed

I just stand in the sun (yeah)
Warm my head in the sun (yeah)
Run around 'til it all stands still
I just wait in the sun

God says it's kind of hard to believe him
Something that's missing that feelin'
Find out how to be collected
Put it in a box and send it

And I don't even wild on the weekend
I don't even know if I mean it
See me never never no no no
See me never never no no no no
See me never never no no no no
And you don't have to run up in my bed
No, you don't have to run up in my bed

I just stand in the sun (yeah)
Warm my head in the sun (yeah)
Run around 'til it all stands still
I just wait in the sun

I just stand in the sun (I just stand in the sun)
Warm my head in the sun (Warm my head in the sun)
Run around 'til it all stands still
I just wait in the sun (I just wait in the sun)
Run around 'til it all stands still
I just wait in the sun (I just wait in the sun)

See me never never no no no
See me never never no no no no
