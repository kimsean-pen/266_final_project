Cracked in half under the overpass
Caught my breath
Blankets strewn behind a shopping cart
Saw my bed
My pleasure comes first, it's always been that way
But first thing tomorrow I plan to change
Tried to flush my sense of self away
But here I am
I would kill just to be like you
Nobody touches you, nothing gets through
Conscience never seems to bother you
Life goes on
Well if you want your money's worth then open up your mouth
But if you want to keep that face then don't come back
There's not enough glue to keep the pins in place
There isn't any point in suffering for something you hate
I got a dose of the bottom and looked away
I got a taste of the real thing and grabbed it with both hands
But I'd kill just to be like you
Nobody touches you, nothing gets through
Living never seems to bother you
You're not like us
