You wired me awake
and hit me with a hand of broken nails
you tied my lead and pulled my chain
to watch my blood begin to boil

But I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run

Yeah, I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage
And run

Too cold to start a fire
I'm burning diesel burning dinosaur bones
I'll take the river down to still water
And ride a pack of dogs

But I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run

Yeah, I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage
And run

Hits like a Phillips head into my brain
It's gonna be too dark to sleep again
Cutting my teeth on bars and rusty chains
I'm gonna break my rusty cage
And run

When the forest burns along the road
Like God's eyes in my headlights
And when the dogs are looking for their bones
And it's raining ice picks on your steel shore

But I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run

Yeah, I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage
And run
