You swore you'd never again let yourself be tempted
Too many times in the past when you've opened up your heart
You've had it broken in pieces by too many lies
Still it's hard to acknowledge the past when she flashes those eyes

Over and over
The song skips
Just as the final refrain fades away
Like fools we are caught in the game

Caught in the game
Caught in the game again
Caught in the game
Caught in the game

I swore I'd never again catch myself believin'
Too many times I've been hurt, and it makes you hard inside
But when I saw you in the city tonight, was it just imagination?
Or did your eyes burn a little too bright? For purely conversation

Over and over
Those lights flash down at the corner arcade
Swept away
Like fools we are caught in the game

Caught in the game
Caught in the game again
Caught in the game
Caught in the game again

Caught in the game
Caught in the game again
Caught in the game
Caught in the game

Over and over
The song skips
Just as the final refrain fades away
Like fools we are caught in the game

Caught in the game
Caught in the game
Caught in the game
Caught in the game

Caught in the game
Caught in the game again
Caught in the game again
Caught in the game again
