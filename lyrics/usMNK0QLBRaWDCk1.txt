Left aside my commiseration
I look inside to wash my frustration away
Spit the hate!
Your vengeance's rising for your own salvation
Vehemence, rise!
To face the betrayal
Dream of the dead
Forever
Despised by the damned
Betrayer!
(To) Kill's my aim
My own destination
And I die inside
For my revenge you cry
Spite is spread!
Your pledge of innocence is dead and gone now
(I) Liberate my darkest devotion
Dream of the dead
Forever
Despised by the damned
Betrayer!
