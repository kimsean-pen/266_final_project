I've got to heat it up
Doctor, got to heat it up
I've got 'til 3 o'clock
I've got to rock until you drop

I've got to heat it up
Doctor, got to heat it up
I've got 'til 3 o'clock
I've got to rock until you drop

(Something, something, something, something)

Something kinda ooooh
Jumpin' on my tutu
Something 'side of me
Wants some part of you-oo-ooh

Something kinda ooooh
Makes my heart go boom, boom
Something 'side of me
Wanting what you dooo-ooh

Something kinda ooooh
Jumpin' on my tutu
Something 'side of me
Wants some part of you-oo-ooh

Something kinda ooooh
Bumpin' in the back room
Something 'side of me
Wanting what you do-oo-ooh

Ooh, when tomorrow comes
Baby, I won't even known your name
Baby, so good
Wanna follow on by
But I'll never meet you
Never see you again

If you gonna put a line on me now, no
Wait 'til the band gonna play real slow
If you want your hands on me
I'm digging you up

Can't dance, no pain, no gain, no show
Jump to the beat all night, don't roll
If you wanna handle me
You got to keep up

Something kinda ooooh
Jumpin' on my tutu
Something 'side of me
Wants some part of you-oo-ooh

Something kinda ooooh
Makes my heart go boom, boom
Something 'side of me
Wanting what you dooo-ooh

Something kinda ooooh
Jumpin' on my tutu
Something 'side of me
Wants some part of you-oo-ooh

Something kinda ooooh
Bumpin' in the back room
Something 'side of me
Wanting what you do-oo-ooh

I've got to heat it up
Doctor, got to heat it up
I've got 'til 3 o'clock
I've got to rock until you drop

I've got to heat it up
Doctor, got to heat it up
I've got 'til 3 o'clock
I've got to rock until you drop

Oh boy, I can't tell you how sad I feel
If tonight, is just another kink in your steel

Shoulda known where the man was at
Shoulda known he was gonna make me
I shoulda recognised the plan attack
When he turned and he called me "baby"

Shoulda known where the man was at
Shoulda known he was gonna make me
Shoulda come with a party rap
So I'd know where the night would take me

(Something, something, something, something)

Something kinda ooooh
Jumping on my tutu
Something 'side of me
Wants some part of you-oo-ooh

Something kinda ooooh
Makes my heart go boom boom
Something 'side of me
Wanting what you dooo-ooh

Something kinda ooooh
Jumping' on my tutu
Something 'side of me
Wants some part of you-oo-ooh

Something kinda ooooh
Bumpin' in the back room
Something 'side of me
Wanting what you do-oo-ooh
