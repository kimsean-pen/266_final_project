I'm scared that every time I say I'm sorry
That I'm more the man I never planned to be
But the saddest part is that I stopped believing
In every word I've said along the way

And I'm sorry
And I swear, I'm okay
Those little words don't mean a thing
When I know, there's no way we'll ever be the same
Because nothing can replace when it's all falling down like rain
But I swear, I'm okay
The only words I have to say

I've seen a mountain crumble down around me
Like an avalanche of medicine to feel
I can tell myself that I am not my father
But it seems that I get closer every year

And I'm sorry
And I swear, I'm okay
Those little words don't mean a thing
When I know, there's no way we'll ever be the same
Because nothing can replace when it's all falling down like rain
But I swear, I'm okay
The only words I have to say

I'm sorry that I'm not the man I promised you I'd be
But I need you now
I'm sorry that I'm not the man I promised you I'd be
But I need you now
Yeah, I need you now
Yeah, I need you now

I swear I'm okay, those little words don't mean a thing
When I know there's no way we'll ever be the same
Because nothing can replace when it's all falling down like rain
But I swear, I'm okay
The only words I have to say
