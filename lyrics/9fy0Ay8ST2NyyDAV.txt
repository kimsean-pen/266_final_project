Face to face, eye to eye
Under lights, no where to hide
Mask of steel, silent words
Waiting till the coin had turned
Many down, one more left
Armour up, sights are set
Turn the key, light it up
One more war to take the cup

Waiting for the whistle, a pistol
Waiting for a sign in the line
On a target like a missile
Waiting for the go, for the big show
Laying out the wire, light the fire
Now we're waiting till it blows

Fight like you'll never die
Fight to stay alive
Fight to raise the crown
Fight to take them down
Fight like you're gods and monsters
Because you want to
To save a life
Fight for you and I
Fight, Fight
Fight for you and I
Fight, Fight

Another brother takin'
Somebody's flag
Breaking somebody's hand
Starting something like he think
He's the man
You know we can't stand by
Let you do what you want
We got the call, got the order
Comin' ready or not
Whatever the threat
Man-made or supernatural
Extra terrestrial
Home, or international

We won't discriminate
Whatever your name
No we won't hesitate
To bring it like a hurricane

Waiting for the whistle,(Fight)a pistol
Waiting for a sign in the line(Fight)
On a target like a missile
Waiting for the go, for the big show
Laying out the wire, light the fire
Now we're waiting till it blows

Fight like you'll never die
Fight to stay alive
Fight to raise the crown
Fight to take them down
Fight like you're gods and monsters
Because you want to
To save a life
Fight for you and I
Fight, Fight
Fight for you and I
Fight, Fight

Fight like you'll never die
Fight to stay alive
Fight to raise the crown
Fight to take them down
Fight like you're gods and monsters
Because you want to
To save a life
Fight for you and I
Fight, Fight
Fight for you and I
Fight, Fight
Fight for you and I

Waiting for the go, for the big show
Laying out the wire, light the fire
Now we're waiting till it blows
