Good, good, good, good enough
Good, good, good enough
Good, good, good enough
Good, good

I can't stop, I can't stop loving you
You're a dreamer and dreaming's what you do
I won't stop believing that this is the end
There must be another way
'Cause I couldn't handle the thought
Of you going away, woah, yeah

Sorry's not good enough
Why are we breaking up?
'Cause I didn't treat you rough
So please don't go changing

What was I thinking of?
You said you're out of love
Baby, don't call this off
Because sorry's not good enough

Don't stop all those things you do
I'm a dreamer and that's what gets you through
I can't fight this feeling that this is the end
We're in the thick of it, where will this ever end?
Woah, woah

Sorry's not good enough
Why are we breaking up?
'Cause I didn't treat you rough
So please don't go changing

What was I thinking of?
You said you're out of love
Baby, don't call this off
Because sorry's not good enough

Oh, you said you'd never leave me here
Yeah, a whole new reason
Sorry's just not good enough for you
Everybody makes mistakes
And that's just what we do

Good, good, good, good enough
Good, good, good enough
Good, good, good enough
Good, good

Don't go changing
Don't go changing
Don't go changing
Don't go changing

Don't go changing
Don't go changing
Don't go changing
Don't go changing

Don't go changing
(Sorry's not good enough)
Don't go changing
(Sorry's not good enough)

Don't go changing
(Sorry's not good enough)
Don't go changing

Sorry's not good enough
Why are we breaking up?
'Cause I didn't treat you rough
So please don't go changing

What was I thinking of?
You said you're out of love
Baby, don't call this off
Because sorry's not good enough

Sorry's not good enough
Sorry's not good enough
