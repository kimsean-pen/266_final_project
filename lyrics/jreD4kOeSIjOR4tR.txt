I never knew what I was gonna be,
Somebody saw what I couldn't see,
And lifted me up now.
I never thought I could be worthy of,
Loving under the sky above,
Don't let the wonderful.

Why does everybody have to fit in?
Yo should feel so damn comfortable in the skin,
Does that mean I am the...
Souvenir of sadness.

Method to the madness.
Hands up if you feel this.
Anyone who has this...

Stand up, nobody's dying to save you!
Speak up, nobody's waiting to see you!
Wake up, nobody's working to pay you!
Let me make it clear you'll have this...

Back then, nobody knew in the schoolyard!
Now then, you have grown up to be this hard!
Go then, walk through this world with your heart scarred!
You're the souvenir of sadness.

They never knew what I was gonna say,
Punch me and kick me and run away,

You know who you are so...
Now look at me what do you have to say,
Never cared much for you anyway,
You know who you are so...

Now look at me what do you have to say,
Never give up for you anyway,
Happy childhood back-lash.
