Remember back in school when used to talk about where we would be in ten years?
Seems like everyone took one step forward while we took two steps back
It's not like I'm asking them to wait up it's just
Don't you have a feel like rewinding the fucking tape?

Let's make a toast to the past
Even though we knew at heart that it wouldn't last
I'm holding on to the memories
Do I have the best years behind me?
I feel the time is running out
We grew up, move on and never looking back
And I guess I am scared that my life can't go back to those days
When we were young and fucking careless
We had the world right in front of us
Planned out, all set, we were young at heart
But as time goes by, I believe
That the world is fucking spinning and it tears us apart
I'm waiting on the next wave from my life
To sweep me off my feet, I can barely hold on for myself
What about my dreams? What about my dreams?
It's the illusion of being free, it wraps up around me
Holds me down and takes the breath right of me

The hands of time is slowly tearing everything apart
Will we stand together?

Do you remember all these years ago?
Shooting stars above, we're laying down below
I remember our conversations
We lived our lives in our imaginations
The sand is pouring through the hourglass
We're stuck at the bottom with no turning back
At least for me 'cause all I can see
Is the memories of everything we wished we could be
I'm holding on to the thought of who we used to be

I used to be the one that you'd turn to when your days were rough
We were young at heart, careless and free, I miss the kids we used to be
I used to be the one that you'd turn to when your days were rough
We were young at heart, careless and free, I miss the kids we used to be
Do I have the best years of my life right behind me?

The hands of time is slowly tearing everything apart
Will we stand together?
Let us see another day
We were young and reckless, and nothing would hold us down
I miss the kids we used to be
I miss the kids we used to be

Nothing in this world will hold us down
Nothing in this world will hold us down
