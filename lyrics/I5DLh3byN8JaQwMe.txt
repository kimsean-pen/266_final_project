Tracksuit grey, black, blue
I was just a hope-filled kid like you
Left ends broke, gotta win, can't lose
Everyting fresh when I came back through
Saying they're a road brudda, that's not true
I'm not second but I am top two
See me in the club with the team
Them blacked out so you know I've gotta wear a black top too
Tracksuit grey, black, blue
I was just a hope-filled kid like you
Left ends broke, gotta win, can't lose
Everyting fresh when I came back through
Saying they're a road brudda, that's not true
I'm not second but I am top two
See me in the club with the team
Them blacked out so you know I've gotta wear a black top too

Trap, trap, trap lines gone and the trap's gone too
Triceps gone and my traps gone too
Now you wear tracksuits listening to "That's Not Me"
But we all know that's not you
Said you've got a new flow, that's not new
When you sound like me but you spray like you
If we've got beef then I'm bringing out Marvel
Man better know I'm bring Capcom too
Man did Belgium twice in a week
Then I flew Bordeaux for a slice of the cheese
So many shows that a man can't sleep
I ain't even really got time for a beat
Mummy said "Go son, go boy, eat"
Did it on my own no scam, no cheat
No label, no chat, no meet
All love here, no gap, no sweet
Niggas in my ends hate me 'cause they're nothing
But I still rep for the West End streets
I'll never get a G check from a neek
Now I've got bread don't think we can beef
Yeah, if I do well, they attack
Trust me, I'm never going out whack
My Spanish miss said I'm gonna fail 'cause I'm brown
Bet you thought I was gonna say black

Tracksuit grey, black, blue
I was just a hope-filled kid like you
Left ends broke, gotta win, can't lose
Everyting fresh when I came back through
Saying they're a road brudda, that's not true
I'm not second but I am top two
See me in the club with the team
Them blacked out so you know I've gotta wear a black top too
Tracksuit grey, black, blue
I was just a hope-filled kid like you
Left ends broke, gotta win, can't lose
Everyting fresh when I came back through
Saying they're a road brudda, that's not true
I'm not second but I am top two
See me in the club with the team
Them blacked out so you know I've gotta wear a black top too

I ain't really tryna be political
I've got an impact and it's physical
I am not a role-model rudeboy
Don't follow me and don't hang from my lyrical
You've got bare art but it's digital
So don't try to send for the London Prince
To win's nothing less than a miracle
Man will get a lift like it's spiritual
Man will get a lift like a boss man
Five star 'cause he had an aux in the Uber
Didn't even hit him that hard and he dived 'cause you're a diver
Like you've got a snorkel or a scuba
Remember my roots, pulled a maneuver
Went in the door, cleaned up like a hoover
Don't get excited because I left radio sets
If I ever walk in, I'm Akuma
Na, Frieza, Cell, Buu, Broly
Still got friends that'll leave man holey
And I've got friends on the deen all holy
I did the grief, on my friend's guacamole
Mole blud, mole
Mates pulled up, blood, pulled 'way
I ain't got a CV but if I did
It would say that I'm all about cream like Olay

Tracksuit grey, black, blue
I was just a hope-filled kid like you
Left ends broke, gotta win, can't lose
Everyting fresh when I came back through
Saying they're a road brudda, that's not true
I'm not second but I am top two
See me in the club with the team
Them blacked out so you know I've gotta wear a black top too
Tracksuit grey, black, blue

Everyting fresh when I came back through
Saying they're a road brudda, that's not true
I'm not second but I am top two
See me in the club with the team
Them blacked out so you know I've gotta wear a black top too
