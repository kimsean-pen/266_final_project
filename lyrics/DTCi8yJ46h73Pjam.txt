Misery is all we know lately
Saturday's are all the same
Sympathy is overrated
Like a snapshot when you've lost the game

Now its the funeral I become the serial killer of us all
Now its the funeral I become the serial killer of us all

No I don't wanna get thrown in your ocean
Don't try
You know that we already know you
It's over

At your, own burial don't forget to cry
At your, own burial

Looking at my 81st birthday
Everyday this body goes to waste
Remembering how I would raise an army when we went back to your place

Now it's the funeral I become a serial killer of us all
Now it's the funeral I become a serial killer of us all
No I, don't wanna get thrown in your ocean
Don't try, you know that we already know you
It's over

At your own burial, don't forget to cry
At your own burial
At your own burial, don't forget to cry
At your own burial
