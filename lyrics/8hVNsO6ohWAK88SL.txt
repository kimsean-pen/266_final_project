Everything you wanted in your life
Has happened to you now
But you're standing in the courtyard
Mourning new lost friends
Whose lives were cut short before the summer's end
And the boy you want so bad
Is sitting courtside with miss everything you hate
And it shapes the way you look at men
You're bothered by the weight of having to pretend
That it's still summer, but it's not summer

18 years
Chained to my fears
In too deep, losing sleep
Tragedies reminding me of why I'm losing sleep
I'm in too deep
I give up, I give up, talk to me
I give up, I give up, talk to me

Every boy you seem to trust
Loves to let you down
They're always standing on the edge of what makes sense
Like it's tryna' focus frame with a dirty lens
And the girls who never let you let it down
The way you give it up
So you fill your tongue with chemicals
And you know the skin hardly memorable
Not like this summer, not like this summer

18 years
Chained to my fears
In too deep, losing sleep
Tragedies reminding me of why I'm losing sleep
I'm in too deep
I give up, I give up, talk to me
I give up, I give up, talk to me
