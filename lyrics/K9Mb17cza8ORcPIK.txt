Forty ounces and a pack of ranch sunflower seeds
Forty answers to the questions she's asking of me
Whatcha doin later on, I got nowhere to be
No no noo, yea
Is my crew on, what are you on
We been uptown cruisin in the Yukon
Got a couple girls on my living room futon
And they about to wake so, better get a move on
Better get some food on
Cause when I'm hungry I'm a prick
I ate a snickers but a snick ain't doin shit
Argue over sushi or Italian for a bit
I say sake bombs, this is something we agree upon
Later on we'll grow on to the bar
A hand full of cash and a brain full of stars
I'm more thrown than a food fight
I'm feelin too right, margarita by the poolside
Wow, this is all I ever wanted in life
Yeah, this is all I ever wanted tonight
And we sang
Forty ounces and a pack of ranch sunflower seeds
Forty answers to the questions she's asking of me
Whatcha doin later on, I got nowhere to be
No no noo, yea eh
And we been roamin for a while
Coast to coast, the bamboo forty five
Kickin up rocks, kickin up dust on the road to rust
When we was very little, Malcolm in the Middle
I fly by in that all white coupe, lookin so clean in that all white suit
And them pretty black girls from them afro roots
Long legs, big hair, and them tie dye hoops, whew
Later on move along to the ville
A warm summer home where the broads wanna chill
I'm thinkin waves and I'm thinkin sun
Thinkin limes and I'm thinkin rum
Thinkin maybe you and I move away from the crowd
Got a little room in the back of the house
And everything's cool, girl
We go together like water and a pool
And we sang
Forty ounces and a pack of ranch sunflower seeds
Forty answers to the questions she's asking of me
Whatcha doin later on, I got nowhere to be
No no noo
Near the ocean, near the water
Only good things, no piranha
All the good days of the views I love
Ain't never been so clear
Near the ocean, near the water
Only good things, no piranha
All the good days of the views I love
Ain't never been so clear
Yea, Forty ounces and a pack of ranch sunflower seeds
Forty answers to the questions she's asking of me
Whatcha doin later on, I got nowhere to be
No no noo
Yea, hey
Summer love and summer stay
Summer ready to roll
Divin deeper through the days better rain or a storm
Whatcha doin later on, I got nowhere to go
No no noo
No no noo
No no noo
