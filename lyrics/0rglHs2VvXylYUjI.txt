I'm trying to remember all the things that I've moaned
They all shine soft and stand alone
Like I picture you waiting at the end of a bridge
But it's hard for me to render up the things that we did

You playing doctor with the door unlocked
Kissing on you cousin then you both got caught
And this is how the cleft was formed inside the silent ground
Those words in your mouth

Please leave us alone
When we're dancing
Please leave us alone
When we're dancing

Is your cheek still red from where you caught her hand
Or are you just in love again
The search party's out yes they're hunting your name
But all your lovers they look the same

You were driving with your eyes going seventy-five
With your foot to the floor and your head to the sky
And this was how the cleft was born inside the silent ground
Those words in your mouth

Please leave us alone
When we're dancing
Please leave us alone
When we're dancing
Please leave us alone
When we're dancing
Please leave us alone
When we're dancing
