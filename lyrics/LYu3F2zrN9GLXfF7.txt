So kind I can't sleep, no sleepin'
Hung up from thinkin', I'm thinkin'
All my anxieties coming at once
All of my issues would colour the sun out
Make it black out
So low I'm lazy, I'm lazy
Too hot I'm hazy, I'm hazy
Every reason to [?]
Every problem I've already dealt with
And I own it

I don't hide my issues, got my issues on my sleeve
I don't hide my issues, all my issues, they own me
And they do what they do
And they show what they show
Won't pretend that I don't got issues

(I don't hide my issues, hide my issues, my issues)
(I don't hide my issues, hide my issues, my issues)
(I don't hide my issues, hide my issues, my issues)
(I don't hide my issues, hide my issues, my issues)

My trust is broken, so broken
Too much emotion, emotion
I took my bag, it's you holding me down
I'm so [?] that I keep it around, yeah
Keep it open

I don't hide my issues, got my issues on my sleeve
I don't hide my issues, all my issues, they own me
And they do what they do
And they show what they show
Won't pretend that I don't got issues

(I don't hide my issues, hide my issues, my issues)
(I don't hide my issues, hide my issues, my issues)
(I don't hide my issues, hide my issues, my issues)
(I don't hide my issues, hide my issues, my issues)

Don't care, not ashamed, not ashamed anymore
Right there, lay 'em out, lay 'em out on the floor
Lay 'em out on the floor
I don't care anymore (oooh)

I don't hide my issues, I got my issues on my sleeve
I don't hide my issues, all my issues, they own me
And they do what they do
And they show what they show
Won't pretend that I don't got issues

(I don't hide my issues, hide my issues, my issues)
(I don't hide my issues, hide my issues, my issues)
(I don't hide my issues, hide my issues, my issues)
(I don't hide my issues, hide my issues, my issues)
