Come on out, come on out, come on out, don't hide
There's no escaping it
Come on out, come on out, come on out, don't hide
You can tell me once, you can tell me a thousand times
Come on out, come on out, come on out, don't hide
Let me down the easy way
Let me down the easy way
Let me down the easy way
Say these things will only fade
Let me down the easy way
Let me down the easy way
Can you hear, can you hear, can you hear the sounds of the departing?
Can you hear, can you hear them fading out?
Maybe I want not to want anymore
And never get, never get, never get lost
So let me down the easy way
Let me down the easy way
Let me down the easy way
Say the things you need to say
Let me down the easy way
Let me down the easy way
Cause I fell out of your pocket back to where I started In the dust that never settles I found my home
Come on out, come on out, come on out, don't hide
Come on out, come on out, come on out, don't hide
Come on out, come on out, come on out, don't hide
Come on out, come on out, come on out, don't hide
