Oh its flowing through me combusting with contempt
rationality abandoning chemically lead astray
stepping outside the confines of this circle bane of society become
I'm about to cross the line and take a life nothing can stop me now

murderous functioning an animal within me speaks
nothing but blood could satisfy these carnal needs

I am your master superior I reign
poised just above you on this death distorted chain

the need to kill transcends temptation I'm sick and in need of blood
withdrawals haunt me taunt me sickly baiting my deeds can never be undone

murderous functioning an animal within me speaks
nothing but blood could satisfy these carnal needs

I am your shepherd cloaked in obscenity heed
these sickening words I worship only what you bleed
I am your master superior I reign
poised just above you on death distorted chain
