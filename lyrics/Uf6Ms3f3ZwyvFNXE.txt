Leave me right here if you wanna
I would never weigh you down
Take all your time and go wander
But don't let them water you down

Ooo
So blue
Are you...

Are you holding up just fine?
In whichever city it is tonight
That gets the pleasure of your footsteps
Kissing the pavement
And your laughter ringing out

Melt like the ice in the summer
And you won't be sticking around
But for me there could be no other
I want you while I'm on the ground

Are you
Holding out like I am
For something worth seeing through?

Are you holding up just fine?
In whichever city it is tonight
That gets the pleasure of your footsteps
Kissing the pavement
And your laughter ringing...
I hope they don't change your mind
To make you feel wrong when you know you're right
'Cause I'll be on your side
I could never forget the way you made me feel
So light

Are you always gonna be
The same person I met on the lawn
We spilled our guts and your hair was long
And black just like the shadows of trees
Reaching for our arms

Are you holding up just fine?
In whichever city it is tonight
That gets the pleasure of your footsteps
Kissing the pavement
And your laughter ringing
I hope they don't change tour mind
To make you feel wrong when tou know you're right
'Cause I'll be on your side
I could never forget the way you made me feel
So light
So light, light, light
So light, light, light
So light, light, light
So light, light, light
