Roll the dice, double two
No more us, no me and you
What a struggle, I took a risk
Another life, another kiss
I start again, it keeps going
We're best friends, not even knowing
I win the race, and then I fall
I gave it up, to have it all

We let go of love, so we can go again
We don't hesitate to let somebody in
To build a home just to get lost
We fire it up, just to burn it off

I don't wanna hold hands with a stranger
I don't wanna walk when I just learned how to run
I don't wanna care, 'cause it's human nature
I don't wanna go, go, go, go back to square one

Said she don't, don't, wanna go back to square one
I just wanna be the one

In the dark, it's brand new
You're teaching me, I'm teaching you
Imagination, I wanna please, but I'm tired of the tears
Give you substance, I need soul
Not just a moment to come and go
It's not simple, it never is
Another life, another kiss (let's go)

We let go of love, so we can go again
We don't hesitate to let somebody in
To build a home just to get lost
We fire it up, just to burn it off

I don't wanna hold hands with a stranger
I don't wanna walk when I just learned how to run
I don't wanna care, 'cause it's human nature
I don't wanna go, go, go, go back to square one

Said she don't wanna go, go back to square one
She just wanna find the one
Someone that she needs, she needs she needs, everybody say

Said she don't wanna go, go back to square one
She just wanna find the one
Someone that she needs, she needs she needs, Jessie

I don't wanna hold hands with a stranger
I don't wanna walk when I just learned how to run
I don't wanna care, 'cause it's human nature
I don't wanna go, go, go, go, go
I don't wanna care, 'cause it's human nature,
I don't wanna go, go, go, go back to square one

Said she don't wanna go, go back to square one
She just wanna find the one
Someone that she needs, she needs, she needs
