May these words be the first
To find your ears.
The world is brighter than the sun
Now that you're here.
Though your eyes will need some time to adjust
To the overwhelming light surrounding us,
I'll give you everything I have.
I'll teach you everything I know.
I promise I'll do better.
I will always hold you close,
But I will learn to let you go.
I promise I'll do better.
I will soften every edge,
I'll hold the world to its best,
And I'll do better.
With every heartbeat I have left
I will defend your every breath,
And I'll do better.
'Ð¡ause you are loved.
You are loved more than you know.
I hereby pledge all of my days
To prove it so.
Though your heart is far too young to realize
The unimaginable light you hold inside,
I'll give you everything I have.
I'll teach you everything I know.
I promise I'll do better.
I will always hold you close,
But I will learn to let you go.
I promise I'll do better.
I will rearrange the stars,
Pull 'em down to where you are.
I promise, I'll do better.
With every heartbeat I have left,
I'll defend your every breath.
I promise I'll do better.
I will soften every edge,
Hold the world to its best.
I promise I'll do better.
With every heartbeat I have left,
I'll defend your every breath,
(I'll do better.)
