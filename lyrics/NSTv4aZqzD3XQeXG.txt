Easy on the eyes
Truth is like a loaded gun
You don't wanna point that thing round here
Make all of your skeletons appear
This is real life
And you've been living fictional
I don't wanna hurt your heart, my dear
But if I gotta cut you, oh I will

'Cause I've given you
Damn near every chance to make it possible
Have it all but all you do is build up all the fears
And drown us in your tears

But I pray for ya, pray for ya, I'll pray, I'll pray, yeah
When all this pain is gone (I pray)
When all this blood has run (I pray)
When my heart's an empty gun (I pray)
When my heart's an empty gun (I pray)
When all this pain is gone (I pray)
When all this blood has run (I pray)

When my heart's an empty gun (I pray)
When my heart's an empty gun (I pray)

Cause I can't even feel the sun
Fighting with the shadows that you cast
I still see the mask
And now we're in the light

You've been hiding all along
I don't wanna hurt your heart, my dear
But the air is crystal clear

And even though
I gave you every chance to make it possible
Have it all but all you do is build up all the fears
And drown us in your tears

But I pray for ya, pray for ya, I'll pray, I'll pray, yeah
When all this pain is gone (I pray)
When all this blood has run (I pray)
When my heart's an empty gun (I pray)
When my heart's an empty gun (I pray)
When all this pain is gone (I pray)
When all this blood has run (I pray)
When my heart's an empty gun (I pray)
When my heart's an empty gun (I pray)

Pray
When all this pain is gone
I'll pray
When all this blood has run
When my heart's an empty gun
When my heart's an empty gun
I'll pray, yeah
When my heart's an empty gun
(I pray)
(I pray)
(I pray)
(I pray)
I'll pray, yeah
When my heart's an empty gun
I'll pray
(I pray)
I'll pray
(I pray)
