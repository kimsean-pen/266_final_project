Weightless my body
Floats in eternity
Weightless beyond the earth's gravity
A euphoric perpetual gaze
I taste the light of days

Beneath a luminescent haze
I cross the convoluted maze
Guided by familiar sight and sound
I let go of what weighs me to the ground

Weightless my body
Floats in eternity
Weightless beyond the earth's gravity
A euphoric perpetual gaze
I taste the light of days
