That look was priceless
Don't let me get carried away
I've seen it before
And it still suits you the same

You catch on quick (you catch on quick)
As the cynics stop before
They give the same review (you catch on quick)

Oh this is where, where the party is
Are you comin home? (are you comin home?)
Are you comin home? (are you comin home?)

You had your chance (you had your chance)
Open arms reject assuming hands (arms reject assuming hands)
You had your chance (you had your chance)
Open arms reject assuming hands

The abortion that you had left you
Clinically dead and made it All that much easier to lie
But its nothing that im proud of (no its nothing that im proud of)
Making an example out of you
Well this is phase one
This is the preview
Well this is phase one

Oh that this is where, where the party is
Are you commin home? (are you comin home?)
Are you comin home? (are you comin home?)

You had your chance (you had your chance)
Open arms reject assuming hands (arms reject assuming hands)
You had your chance (you had your chance)
Open arms reject assuming hands (arms reject assuming hands)

Don't act like you're the first one
I treat it like disease
Sure it's rough around the edges
It's the only thing you see

Don't act like you can't see me
Darling, coming
Don't act like you can't see me
Darling, coming
Don't act like you can't see me
Darling, coming
Don't act like you can't see me coming

You had your chance (you had your chance)
Open arms reject assuming hands (arms reject assuming hands)
You had your chance (you had your chance)
Open arms reject assuming hands (arms reject assuming hands)

You had your chance
You had your chance
You had your chance
