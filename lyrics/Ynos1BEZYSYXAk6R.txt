I see you as soon as I come through
First thing I think when I walk in that room
Is: Fuck, this girl is so beautiful
I wonder if you would look back at me too

You never do
I wanna tell you why you should come over for the night
But when I catch your eye
I get this feeling from inside
It's like: Bruv, this shit ain't wise
Usually wanna like her
Wish I could decide

I wonder, should I say so?
I want to, but I never know how to
I'll try again tomorrow
I hope that one day I'll dare tell you

I wonder, should I say so?
I want to, but I never know how to
I'll try again tomorrow
I hope that one day I'll dare tell you

I wonder, should I?
I wonder, should I say so?
I wonder, should I?
I wonder, should I say so?
(Say so, say so, say so)

On my mind, always on my mind
And I don't even know your name
Or what you like, what you like
But still I want to hold you like your mine
'Cause I know if I don't tell you
Exactly how I'm feeling, I'll regret
So I must try to share a breath
Need to find my confidence
But I don't have it at the moment
Where'd it go?
I'm only like this when I see you

I wonder, should I say so?
I want to, but I knever know how to
I'll try again tomorrow
I hope that one day I'll dare tell you

I wonder, should I say so?
I want to, but I knever know how to
I'll try again tomorrow
I hope that one day I'll dare tell you

I wonder, should I?
I wonder, should I say so?
I wonder, should I?
I wonder, should I say so?

(Should I tell you love?)
(Should I tell you love?)

I wonder, should I say so?
I want to, but I knever know how to
I'll try again tomorrow
I hope that one day I'll dare tell you
I wonder, should I say so?
I want to, but I knever know how to
I'll try again tomorrow
I hope that one day I'll dare tell you

I wonder, should I?
I wonder, should I say so?
I wonder, should I?
I wonder, should I say so?

(Say so, say so, say so)
(Say so, say so, say so)
