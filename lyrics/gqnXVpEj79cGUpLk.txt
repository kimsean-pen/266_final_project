Drawin' Mickey Mouse with the curtains drawn
Get my blood drawn at least once a month
I've always wanted this all along, all along

All along, I've always wanted this all along

Wish I did a lot of things differently
My mom says don't let it get to me
I love you all
Gunshots raining
Late night, same team
Go to sleep, I'll be safe

All along, I've always wanted this all along

Empty Popeye's bag
On the floor, I don't get sad
On the floor, I don't get sad
Empty Popeye's bag
On the floor, I don't get sad
On the floor, I don't get sad

Broke my hands in the car door slams
(Watch me do it, watch me do it, watch me do it
Let's go do it, why don't, do you, it's my enemy
Get on, get off, keep on)
