Liquid is in your throat
For hopeless delight

...
After all you fell in love with death
Life has aborted
All you've had and all you became

The night is calling, you pray forth
A barren waste is your land

Crops they were sown to
Die
The skin is a mirror
The eyes hollow with ignorance

Health runs from your lips
Sucked in and safe from the world of sleep
...

All years caring for a liar
Benefit road is winding higher

You're a moth too close to the fire
...

You are stuck in a route of confusion
Changing and waiting and seeking the truth of it all
...

Fleeing in sorrows
Pushing your spirit away

...
Sick of the weakness of the psyche

Whisper from the heart of evil
Luring them all into despair

Resenting the goods of a savior
Cries out

Restless will also
Die
A selection culled from the damned
Drawing a lifeline of one
A friend died in your room
And sought the birth of a follower
...
Oh
Oh, brother!
...
You're a killer
and you target yourself
...
I wish you'd never come back
...
for us to see
The beckoning end
(Solo)
And the pride of the mother
Drawn close in a mother's son
And the love from a father
Was used by a father's son
Ah
And the pride of the mother
Drawn close in a mother's son
And the love from a father
Was used by a father's son
...
Ah
Overheard us talking
In a smoke of lost hope
The language of a parting
So clear and so true
...
Overheard us talking
