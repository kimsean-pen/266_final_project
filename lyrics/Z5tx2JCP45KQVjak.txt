Way down on the borderline
Down where white folks tread easy
That sun beats so hot sun beats so hot
When a little girl pass by
You can smell the way she walks
You can smell, you can smell the way she walks
In late afternoon
Ah, in late
Little girl little girl little girl
Smile so brightly
Come on boy come on boy
Oh Take a walk with me
