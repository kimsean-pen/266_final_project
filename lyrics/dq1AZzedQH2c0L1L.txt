Tell yourself it's over now
Try to kill a broken vow
If only you could find the strength
To kill the memories
These empty pages never turn
You lit the flame and let them burn
You tried to bury me so deep
But what will lie beneath?

Will your hope die alone?
Will you fade on your own?
Can you just turn away and let me go?

Lie to me if you can feel
That this love was never real
Walk away if you can learn to love again
Lie to me, if you can leave
I'll still be here when you see
You're not alone
You don't have to run again
And leave me in denial

All your secrets crawl inside
You keep them safe, you let them hide
You feel them drinking in your pain
To kill the memories
So close your eyes and let it hurt
The voice inside begins to stir
Are you reminded of all you used to be?

Can you just turn away and let me go?

Lie to me if you can feel
That this love was never real
Walk away if you can learn to love again
Lie to me, watch me bleed
'Cause I'll still be here when you see
You're not alone
You don't have to run again
And leave me in denial

All the pain you fed
It starts to grow inside
It lives again and you can't let it die
So you believe you'll never find
A reason to love again

Lie to me, watch me bleed
I'll be here when you see
You're not alone
You don't need to run

Lie to me, watch me bleed
'Cause I'll still be here when you see
You're not alone
You don't have to run again
And leave me in denial
You can learn to love again
And leave me in denial
You can learn to love again
And leave me in denial
