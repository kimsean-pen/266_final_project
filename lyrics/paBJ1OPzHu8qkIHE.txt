She was there at the bar
She heard my guitar
She was long and tall
She was the queen of them all
Last night, thinking about last night
Last night, thinking about last night
She was dark and discreet
She was light on her feet
We went up to her room
And she lowered the boom
Last night, thinking about last night
Last night, thinking about last night
Down below they danced and sang in the street
While up above, the walls were steaming with heat
Last night, thinking about last night
Last night, thinking about last night
I was feeling no pain
Feeling good in my brain
I looked in her eyes
They were full of surprise
Last night, talking about last night
Last night, talking about last night
I asked her to marry me, she smiled and pulled out a knife
The party's just beginning she said, your money or your life
Last night, talking about last night
Last night, talking about last night
Now I'm back at the bar
She went a little too far
She done me wrong
All I got is this song
Last night, thinking about last night
Last night, thinking about last night
Last night, talking about last night
Last night, talking about last night
Last night, thinking about last night
Last night, thinking about last night
