Man with the cigarette
I'd always look around for his fitting brain
I'm torn between obsession and hate
For the mess that he made me make

Man with the cigarette
I'd always wonder if he's always spinning thread
I'm torn between the mess that he made
For the mess that you made me make

And I could only have you in my dreams
Oh, so it seems, so it seems
And I could only have you in my dreams
Oh, so it seems, so it seems

And I could only have you in my dreams
So it seems
And I could only have you in my dreams
So it seems, so it seems

And I could only have you in my dreams
Oh, so it seems, so it seems
