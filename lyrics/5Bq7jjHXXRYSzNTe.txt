Don't know how it happened to us
But we're here again
The odds are stacked
We have to believe
There's time
With the sun going down
Behind buildings surround it's like a tomb
I'm not giving up til I find what I'm looking for...
...tonight.
You and I must find each other
Even if I'm blind from glaring lights,
Even if it takes all night
I'm lost in love with you
Do you know the way that I should turn?
Do you know that I have learned?
I'm lost in this dance with you
Making my way through the city streets
They're so rushed and loud
Passer-bys that resemble your face deceive
Pull your picture from my pocket to remind myself,
No need for clues
I keep on searching,
It's you that I'm looking for...
...tonight.
You and I must find each other
Even if I'm blind from glaring lights
Even if it takes all night
I'm lost in love with you
Do you know the way that I should turn?
Do you know that I have learned?
I can see that you can see a love that can't compare
Really isn't fair after all
Even if I'm blind from glaring lights,
Even if it takes all night
I'm lost in love with you
Do you know the way that I should turn?
Do you know that I have learned?
I'm lost in this dance with you
Looking up and down and all around
Looking for what can't be found
I'm lost in love with you
Shadows on the wall appear to be
But shadows never what they seem
I'm lost in this dance with you
