Overcast, the branches bare
The autumn leaves have fallen
I can hear the magpies laugh
I can't shake this melancholy
And then the cloud breaks
A ray of sunlight – Gloria!
As if a promise
Some strange kind of euphoria
Dark phantoms of the past
Some things are best forgotten
Like Orpheus, don't look back
The best years are waiting for you
And then the cloud breaks
A ray of sunlight – Gloria!
As if a promise.
Some strange kind of euphoria
