When I was born
I hada think up a song
To live like I wish
I had to flop like a fish
In the confusion
I made an illusion
I spit out a track
And I don't look back

I Gotta One Track Mind
I Gotta One Track Mind
I Gotta One Track Mind
Over You

Evrythings nice
When you're coved in ice
But you open yer eyes
And it's one big lie
Well I feel right in home
In This Room of my own
My rule book is finish
It says don't come in

I Gotta One Track Mind
I Gotta One Track Mind
I Gotta One Track Mind
Over You

I got tracks on my arms
Trakcs on my face
There's track on the walls
And all over the place
But I don't think I'd miss it
If I had you to fix it
I just want you
For just one night

I Gotta One Track Mind
I Gotta One Track Mind
I Gotta One Track Mind
Over You

I Gotta One Track Mind
I Gotta One Track Mind
I Gotta One Track Mind
I Gotta One Track Mind
I Gotta One Track Mind
I Gotta One Track Mind
Over You
