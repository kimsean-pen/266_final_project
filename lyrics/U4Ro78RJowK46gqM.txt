In the beginning
There's a heatwave
It's us from nothing
I caught a red-eye
Out to bed-sty
To get your lovin'

'Cause we got no secrets to tell
You know me like I know myself
Well, it's alright
All of my time in the world
I want you to be my one girl
It's alright

If you were the first person on Earth
We would be together when it ends
Started when we had no names or words
Finishing each others sentences
Nobody understands me
Nobody like you do
So if I'm the last one standing
I would wanna watch it burn with you

Because you're timeless
You see my clearly
All of your violence, turns to silence
When you are near me

'Cause we got no secrets to tell
You know me like I know myself
Well, it's alright
All of my time in the world
I want you to be my one girl
It's alright

If you were the first person on Earth
We would be together when it ends
Started when we had no names or words
Finishing each others sentences
Nobody understands me
Nobody like you do
So if I'm the last one standing
I would wanna watch it burn with you

And see it born anew

'Cause we got no secrets to tell
You know me like I know myself
Well, it's alright
All of my time in the world
I want you to be my one girl
It's alright

If you were the first person on Earth
We would be together when it ends
Started when we had no names or words
Finishing each others sentences
Nobody understands me
Nobody like you do
So if I'm the last one standing
I would wanna watch it burn with you
I would wanna watch it burn with you
(I would wanna watch it burn with you)
