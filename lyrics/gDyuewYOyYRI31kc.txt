I get up in the morning and I see your face, girl
You're looking so good, everything's in place
Don't you know, I could never leave your side, girl
Won't you stay here with me and be my bride?

Don't you know you're my kind?
You're just what I like, girl, you're everything
Don't you know you're alright?
The only girl, I've always needed for so long

Oh oh oh, she's my cover girl
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, she's my cover girl
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

When I look through the pages of a magazine
Still, your pretty face is the prettiest I've seen
Don't you know, I only want to be with you
No other girl could make me feel the way you do

You're my everything

Oh oh oh, she's my cover girl
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, she's my cover girl
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh, she's my cover girl
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, she's my cover girl
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Base! It's alright!
Oh yeah, it's out of sight
Let me say it's alright, ahh yeah!

Don't you know, I only want to be with you
No other girl could make me feel the way you do

You're my everything
Oh oh oh, she's my cover girl
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, she's my cover girl
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, she's my, she's my cover girl
Oh yeah, cover girl, sweet sexy thing
Oh yeah, cover girl
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh cover girl,
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh.
