Like a Sky
Like a Bird
Like a Sword
Like a Shield

WHOO WHOO WHOO

Like a Robot
Like a Monster
Like an Angel
You are perfect

キラキラと輝く星が 君が
あまりに眩（まぶ）しくて眩しくて
すくすくと育（はぐく）む現世の天使
来世には戦士

WHOO WHOO WHOO

And the song goes on
And we dance til dawn
If you feel alright
Set it free
"whoo whoo whoo"
Let it out
"whoo whoo whoo"

WHOO WHOO WHOO

And the song goes on
And we dance til dawn
If you feel alright
Set it free
"whoo whoo whoo"
Let it out
"whoo whoo whoo"
