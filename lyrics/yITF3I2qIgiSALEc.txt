You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill

How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still

Nothing seems to matter
Here's my heart on a silver platter
Oh where is my will
Why this strange desire
Flaming higher and higher
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still

Oh where's my will
Why this strange desire
Flaming higher and higher
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still
Oh you're my thrill
