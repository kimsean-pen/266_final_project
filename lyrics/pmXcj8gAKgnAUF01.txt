Please be careful what you say
I may die this way
Be careful how your mouth pulled apart
I can see your lips, I don't wanna feel your heart

Slowly lie to me
Like you do when you tell the truth
Slowly lie to me
Like I need you to do so I can hear you say
Something that sounds right
Slowly lie to me
Like you do when you tell the truth

Please be careful what you say
'Cause if I split in two you will be to blame
'Cause I know nothing better and nothing worse
And how you twist your letters into words

Slowly lie to me
Like you do when you tell the truth
Slowly lie to me
Like I need you to do so I can hear you say
Something that sounds right
Slowly lie to me
Like I need you to do when you tell the truth

And tell me what to believe, and tell me what to deny
And whisper into my ear till everything dark turns bright

Slowly lie to me
Like you do when you tell the truth
Slowly lie to me
Like I need you to do so I can hear you say
Something that sounds right
