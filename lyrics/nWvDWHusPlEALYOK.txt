the flowers of all love spent in vain
are never the same as they seemed
the silver is severing their plain
petals distinct to fade away

now they wilt forever
nothing come through
afterlight

come on the hunger following
now that it's plain enough to see
the dirt on the veil of ecstasy
in temporal hours turn to leaves

wilted as the flower
where nothing come through
