It holds you in its arm
Keeps you safe from harm
You're sent due from afar
The places you walk
It knows harder parts
Happiest in the dark
Tryin' to squeeze out its void
Probably wrong
The places you walk

Told you flee
Tortured being, take you into it now
You're trying endlessly
When you try to kill the will against
Best beloveth, stay with me

All you had to deceide
'Tween the bones and the hide
Inner self in tick tar
The places you walk
Buried deep in your mind
All you know from time
The invisible fiend
You've been warned
Of the places you walk

Angel thee, want you into it now
You hold unamously
You know we tried to kill the will but things
Leaving now, let it be

It holds you in its arm
Keeps you safe from harm
You're sent due from afar
The places you walk
In most harder parts
Happiest in the dark
Tryin' to squeeze out its void
From a walk
The places you walk
