Never see a big church steeple
When I call you on the phone
Never feel the rush of angels
When we stay up late alone
Never whisper you a great love story
Only scream and cry and moan
But you're a good man
But you're a good man
I keep telling myself to just let go
Ooh, let go... of the one who took all your gold

I get home and there's a love note waiting
But only he is here tonight
And the words, the promises you're making
Only echo all these lies
And for every sweet nothing you whisper
Why is goodbye my reply?
Cause you're a good man
Cause you're a good man

I keep telling myself to just let go

There was someone that I knew before
A heart from the past
That I can not forget
And I let him take all my gold
And hurt me so bad
But now for you

I have nothing left
Of all my gold

A ghost from the past

Has turned my heart black
Am I ever gonna let him go?
And get my gold back?

And today I was a dead girl walking
City light burnt through the tears
Heard you say my name and get to talking
About the love and all the fear
And you saw all the pain I was holding

And yet still you hold me near
Cause you're a good man
Cause you're a good man
I keep telling myself to just let go

There was someone that I knew before
A heart from the past
That I cannot forget
I let him take all my gold
And hurt me so bad
That now for you
I have nothing left
Cause there was someone that I knew before
A heart from the past
That I can not forget
I let him take all my gold
And hurt me so bad
That now for you
I have nothing left
Of all my gold
