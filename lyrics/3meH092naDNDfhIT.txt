Oh oh oh
In the beginning
I tried to warn you
You play with fire
It's gonna burn you
And here we are now
Same situation

You never listen
I never listen, now
I'm thinking of a way
That I can make an escape
It's got me caught up in a web
And my hearts the prey

Do you really wanna throw your heart
Away, away, away?
Everybody's hurt somebody before
Everybody's been hurt by somebody before
You can change but you'll always come back for more
It's a game and we're all just victims of love

Don't try to fight it
Victims of love
You can't decide it
Victims of love

Oh oh oh oh oh
Victims of love

Oh oh oh oh oh
Now you back track
You're running away
'Cause it just happened again

And you just wanted to end
Trying the best not to let yourself go cold, so cold
Now you've thinking of the things
You thought you wanted to say
But when you open up your mouth
They don't come out that way
Are you really gonna throw your heart away
Away, away?

Everybody's hurt somebody before
Everybody's been hurt by somebody before
You can change but you'll always come back for more
It's a game and we're all just victims of love
Don't try to fight it
Victims of love
You can't decide it
Victims of love
Oh oh oh oh oh
Victims of love
Oh oh oh oh oh
Victims of love
In the beginning
I tried to warn you
You play with fire
It's gonna burn you
And here we are now
Same situation
You never listen
I never listen
Everybody's hurt somebody before
Everybody's been hurt by somebody before
You can change but you'll always come back for more
It's a game and we're all just victims of love
Everybody's hurt somebody before
Everybody's been hurt by somebody before
You can change but you'll always come back for more
It's a game and we're all just victims of love
Don't try to fight it
Victims of love
You can't decide it
Victims of love
Oh oh oh oh oh
Victims of love
Oh oh oh oh oh
Victims of love
