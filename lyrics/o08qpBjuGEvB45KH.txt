Meet me there, in the blue
Where words are not, feeling remains
Sincerity, trust in me
Throw myself into your door

I go, in circles, running down
In circles, I'm running down
In circles, running down
In circles, running down

Meet me there, in the blue
Where words are not, feeling remains
And I dream, to heal your wounds
But I bleed myself, I bleed myself

I go, in circles, running down
In circles, I'm running down
In circles, running down
In circles, running down

In circles, in circles
I go, in circles, running down
In circles, I'm running down
In circles, running down
In circles, running down
