I sit around and watch the tube, but nothing's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit, I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors and I'm fucking lazy

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to Paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind, and I smell like shit

Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as Hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a dog in heat, barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell, and I lost the key

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to Paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind, and I smell like shit

I got no motivation, where is my motivation?
No time for no motivation, smoking my inspiration

I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will
My mother says to get a job, but she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun, you're fucking lazy

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to Paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind, and loneliness has to suffice
Bite my lip and close my eyes
I'm slipping away to Paradise
Some say: "Quit or I'll go blind, but it's just a myth"
