It takes a lotta time
Course I said it would
To begin to trust this home
And it's so much harder to go

No better tale has come?
My heart...
Where is my heart?
I'm losing it...

Then I saw a face
That somehow challenged my own
Oh how's it gonna go?

I wish I was still there
And not? off the edge of thinking

The sun shines?
Oh some day
I will answer, go embrace
Oh
It's undercover but we're so in love
I try to say it but I can't out loud

And the sun shines on our death, Iowa
Where is my heart?
Where is my heart?
Where is my heart?
Where is my heart?

I'm losing it...

I'm pressing down on faith
Questioning, I call forth and evoke
How's it gonna go?

I wish I was still there
And not? off the edge of thinking

My heart shatters
Oh someday
I will answer, go embrace
It's undercover but we're so in love
I try and say it but I can't out loud
And the sun shines on our death, Iowa
The sun shines

Oh someday I will answer go embrace
Oh it's undercover but we're so in love
I try and say it but I can't out loud
And the sun shines on our death, Iowa
Where is my heart?
Where is my heart?
Where is my heart?
Where is my heart?
I'm losing it...
