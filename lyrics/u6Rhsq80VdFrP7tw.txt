No I couldn't tell you how the house burned down
Last night while we were running around
Midnight surrounds you with moonlight makes you proud
Last night oh we were running around

Sing for last call
Sing for last fall
Such was it all

Sing for last call
Sing for last fall
Such was it all

All along, I was your home
All along, I was your home
