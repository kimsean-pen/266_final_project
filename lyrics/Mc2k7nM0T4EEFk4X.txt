Cerberus in the underworld
Guards the gates of hell
Protects the world of Hades
Where the dead must dwell
The gods look down in anger
On this wicked land
The battle of the Titans
Will be the final stand

Unleash the gods of war

Thunderbolt
Father of the sky
Thunderbolt
The gods have sent a sign

Zeus is in the heavens
Watching from the sky
The gods are on Olympus
Waiting for a sign
The Kraken rise below them
Titan of the sea
Calling for Poseidon
To set the chaos free

Unleash the gods of war

Thunderbolt
Father of the sky
Thunderbolt
The gods have sent a sign
Thunderbolt
Clashing from the sky
Thunderbolt
Hear the heavens cry

Heavens cry
Heavens cry

Master of the heavens
Ruler of the sky
Homer writes the Odyssey
About the gods on high
Ancient Greek mythology
Tells tales of spite and greed
The vanity that comes through power
Never should succeed

Unleash the gods of war

Thunderbolt
Father of the sky
Thunderbolt
The gods have sent a sign
Thunderbolt
Tearing past the sky
Thunderbolt
Hear the heavens cry
