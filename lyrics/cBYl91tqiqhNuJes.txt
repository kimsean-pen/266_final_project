Sign me up, holding you, the future is in your room
Recite with us: "Only the future is here anew."
When the phone booth rings, it's the happening thing
You need to change your tune

Sign the page, only the future is here anew
Sign with us, only the future is in review
Where the article led, the satisfied said
"The keys are in your room."

When the monitor sings and the mission bell rings
You need to change your tune
With a sideways glance, are you acting by chance?
We need you in your room
