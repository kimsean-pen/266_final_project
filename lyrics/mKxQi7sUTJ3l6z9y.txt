Neurotic smart bombs fault intolerant
Killing in recursive parabolas
Black boxes shake hands scoping for shroud lines
With ten thousand mile stares

Let me share my heart with you
As I'm guided by the dead to a miserable end
Sstrands of descent and finite life spans
On and on if only there could be no more

Sleeve
Down the vacuum heart
Scream
The sleeve drags on and on
Siege
It seems to go on and on
Wings
A precise outline oh cruel angel
That will sever even your golden wings
