Rolling down the hills
In yellow and white
I see my figure out in front me
The body shapes itself accordingly
I'm for all when I am geometry

Rolling down the hills
In blue and green
I close my eyes and spiral away from all I've done and seen
Pulled away quietly
To the farthest reaches of night

Rolling back to white
Dust and dark clouds make me glad
If the day seems bleak
Why should I feel deprived?
Rolling back I'm alive
