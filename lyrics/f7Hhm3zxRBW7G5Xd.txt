If I run into you
I'm gonna turn away
I won't pick up the phone
If you call me today
'Cause
You're the kind of girl
Who can make a man ooooh
Smile
And I got to move ahead
I can't afford to lose more time
I'm trying to break through
I'm trying to get over you
And there's nothing I can do
But stay away

You throw me around
And then you reel me back in
You reach out those arms
And then I fall for your charms, again
I played along
But I need more than your gaze
Now I need to move ahead
And I'm gonna leave you behind

I'm trying to break through
I'm trying to get over you
And there's nothing I can do
But stay away

Baby!
I feel it in my heart
This love can play no part
Baby!
I feel it in my heart
This love can play no part
