The world's a liar
Foolish of me
Misfortune fires
I'll only bleed another burden
Another memory
Just keep my mouth shut
I won't say a thing for my

Poor Lenore
Poor Lenore
Poor Lenore
Poor Lenore

It faults and falls down
Devil in me
An easy rider
Sharp young athlete
Another burden
Another memory
Just keep my mouth shut
I won't say a thing for my

Poor Lenore
Poor Lenore
Poor Lenore
Poor Lenore

Night terrors won't leave me alone

They won't leave me alone
They won't leave me alone

Although I'd love to walk you home
They won't leave me alone
