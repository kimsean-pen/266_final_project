We say it's okay to leave it alone
But i want u to notice
This case isn't closed
Doors are open
The lights are left on
And there's never a night I sleep
With the dreams that I'd have if u never decided
Decided to leave
Decided
Decided to leave...
There's never an ounce that I breathe
Without thinking about
Who i could have been with you
There's never an ounce that I breathe
Without thinking about
Who I could have been if you didn't leave

The phone's been patient to hear your call
But you never touched the dial
You never touched the dial, now I know
There's someone I wish walked through these halls
But you'll never take the chance to come home
So come home

You say we can learn from this
But I just don't know
what to do without you anymore
your absence has taken it's toll on me
what i should believe
i just cant believe

there's never an ounce that i breathe
without thinking about who i could have been with you
there's never an ounce that i breathe without thinking about who i could have been if you didn't leave

the phones been patient to hear your call
but you never touched the dial
never touched the dial
and now i know
there's someone i wish walked through these halls
but you never take the chance to come home
so come home

you say it isn't my fault
so i steer away
i put off the pain
for another day
you think it wouldn't be tough
8 years were never enough
I'll wait for you
if you'll never change
i will be okay
but I'll still stay up for you
just in case you make the time for the right move

the phone's been patient to hear your call
but you never touched the dial
you never touched the dial
and now i know
there's someone i wished walked through these halls
but you'll never take the chance to come home
so come home

there's someone i wished walked through these halls
but you never touched the dial
you'll never touch the dial
and now i know
the phones been patient to hear your call
but you'll never take the chance to come home
and you'll never take the chance to come home
just come home...
