You were working as a waitress
In a cocktail bar
When I met you
I picked you out, I shok you up and turned you around
Turned you into someone new

Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget
It's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too

Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it
When I hear that you won't see me

Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe it
When you say that you don't need me

It's much too late to find
You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back
Or we will both be sorry

Don't you want me, baby
Don't you want me, ohh
Don't you want me, baby
Don't you want me, ohh

I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you

The five years we have had
Have been such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I lived my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do

Don't (Don't), don't you want me? (Don't you want me?)
You know I can't believe it
When I hear that you won't see me

Don't (Don't), don't you want me? (Don't you want me?)
You know I don't believe you
When you say that you don't need me

It's much too late to find
You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back
Or we will both be sorry

Don't you want me, baby
Don't you want me, ohh
Don't you want me, baby
Don't you want me, ohh

(...)

Don't you want me, baby
Don't you want me, ohh
Don't you want me, baby (Baby)
Don't you want me, ohh

Don't you want me, baby (Baby)
Don't you want me, ohh
Don't you want me, baby
(Ooh) Don't you want me, ohh

Don't you want me, baby
