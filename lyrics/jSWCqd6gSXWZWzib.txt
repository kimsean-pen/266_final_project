Tear me down
Tell me I don't need to fear
Tell me now
Tell me somebodies near
'Cause sirens
Sirens are all I hear

They keep calling out
Keep calling out someone's name
Keep calling out
And all I can do is pray
That these sirens
Sirens don't come our way

Or we'll be all run run running away
Or we'll be all run run running away
All run run running away
When sirens they come our way
It's raining now
It's raining on someone's fears

Raining down
I've heard the rain is the city's tears
But these sirens
These sirens are all I hear
And they keep calling out
Keep calling out someone's name

Keep calling out
And all I can do is pray
That these sirens
These sirens don't come our way
Or we'll be all run run running away
Or we'll be all run run running away

Or we'll be all run run running away
When sirens they come our way
all run run running away
all run run running away
Or we'll be all run run running away
When sirens they come our way
