Way up at the mighty mountains,
Deep into the woods.
We are gathered and we are back.
At last, the night is ours.

Tonight, our shadows dancing
In the light of a fire.
This night is to be remembered,
This night we'll free our souls.

In the mighty woods I wander,
Through the trees thou can see my shadow.
By the cold wind in my skin
I behold my throne for thee, my sorrow.

Now the symphony plays my song,
My voice thou hear in the night.
I will never leave for no one else in my life.

Tonight we are all together,
Tonight we all leave together.
When the darkness falls
We are on our way.
Tonight we are all together,
Tonight we'll leave together.
This is our dream forever,
Now we are leaving.

In the mighty woods I wander,
Through the trees thou can see my shadow.
By the cold wind in my skin
I behold my throne for thee, my sorrow.

Now the symphony plays my song,
My voice thou hear in the night.
I will never leave for no one else in my life,
I will always sing my song in the night.

And now we are up together
And soon we'll dance forever.
Sing, my choir, let this night be remembered.

Now, my angel, sing for the darkness,
Forever dancing in this cold winternight.

And now we are up together
And soon we'll dance forever.
Sing, my choir, let this night be remembered.

Now, my angel, sing for the darkness,
Forever dancing in this cold winternight.
