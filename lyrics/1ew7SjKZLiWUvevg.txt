How can I tell you I was wrong?
How can I tell you I was wrong?
When I am the proudest man ever born
I stand on the horizon
I want to step across it with you
But when the sun's this low
Everything's cold on the line of the horizon
Come to me
Oh won't you come to me
Come to me
Oh won't you come to me
Come to me
Oh won't you come to me
Won't you come to me, yeah
How can I tell you I was wrong?
How can I tell you I was wrong?
When I am the cruellest man you have known
That you ever known
That you ever known
That you ever known
I stand on the horizon
I want to step across it with you
But when the sun is this low
Everything's cold on the line of the horizon
In South Shields Metro station
I heard Marsden Rock was breaking
The North Sea shaking
All that we know
To make us see the point of living is to live
So won't you come to me
Won't you come to me, yeah
Come to me
Won't you come to me, yeah
