The catholic beast
Rapes the children

The corrupted gouvernment
Commands the power
Only now, our body
Is putrefied

But our mind
Has to overcome
There's no way

For putrid to stop us!
The catholic beast
Rapes the children

The corrupted gouvernment
Commands the power
Only now, our body
Is putrefied
But our mind
Has to overcome

The catholic beast!
The catholic beast!
