Love sick dreaming when we first met
You gave me your world with no regrets
Never thought anything could come against
But oh what did I know

One missed step and I'm on my own
You washed your hands clean of me, right or wrong
Behind closed doors I was broken though
Trying to keep it out sight of the world
I couldn't say

A million miles that I have gone
Signs that say to give it up
Just tear me down or lift me up
No time for tears
No time for tears

No time for tears

Put myself together and hear the sounds
Oh my heart's been thrown around
I gave you my sky before I found my ground
But God what did I know

Now come on, come on, you got me wrong
Come on, come on, just play along
Back to love sick dreaming when we first met
Trying to keep it on top of the world
I need to say

A million miles that I have gone
Signs that say to give it up
Just tear me down or lift me up
No time for tears
No time for tears

I'm calling out what is done is done
Now's that time to shake it off
Crazy cycles going on
No time for tears
No time for tears

No time for tears
No time for tears

Get up, get up, get up to feel better
Get up, get up, get up to feel better
Get up, get up, get up to feel better
Get up, get up, get up to feel better

No time for tears
No time for tears

A million miles that I have gone
Signs that say to give it up
Just tear me down or lift me up
No time for tears
No time for tears (No time for tears, no time for tears)
No time for tears (No time for tears, no time for tears)
No time for tears (No time for tears, no time for tears)

No time, hey hey
No time
Signs that say
Hey! (No time for tears, no time for tears)
No time for tears
