They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones
It was then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

They walked along by the old canal
A little confused, I remember it well
Stopped into an old hotel with the neon burnin' bright
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate

A clarinet some place softly played
She was walkin' on by the arcade
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was comin' up
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

He woke up and she was gone
He didn't see nothing but the dawn
He got out of bed with his clothes back on, pushed back blind
Found a note she'd left behind, to which he just could not relate
All about a simple twist of fate

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along through the city blocks
Hunt her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll see him once again, how long must he wait?
Once more time for a simple twist of fate

People tell me that it's a crime
To feel too much at any one time
She should have caught me in my prime, she would have stayed with me
Instead of goin' off to sea and leavin' me to meditate
Upon a simple twist of fate
