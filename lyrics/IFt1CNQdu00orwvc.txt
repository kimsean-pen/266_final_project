Do you live your life in god's filth?
Or do you live according to Him?
Do the codes of man please you?
Or do you lead a life of "sin"?
Do you find pleasure in the rising sun?
Or do you curse the day it all begun?
Do you understand humanitarian ways?
Or do you feel the urge to destroy?
Do you feel like you are home?
Or are you only a visitor?
Do you look into the stars filled with awe?
Or do you will to ascend above?
Do you wish to be loved?
Do you care?
Or does your hatred feed your strength?
Do the cosmic laws apply to you?
Or is the ALL of CHAOS for you?
