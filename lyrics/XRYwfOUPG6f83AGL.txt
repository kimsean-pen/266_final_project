We're only making plans for Nigel
We only want what's best for him
We're only making plans for Nigel
Nigel just needs that helping hand

And if young Nigel says he's happy
He must be happy
He must be happy
He must be happy in his world

We're only making plans for Nigel
He has his future in a British steel
We're only making plans for Nigel
Nigel's whole future is as good as sealed
Yeah

And if young Nigel says he's happy
He must be happy
He must be happy
He must be happy in his world

Nigel is not outspoken
But he likes to speak
And loves to be spoken to (in his world)
Nigel is happy in his world (in his world)
Nigel is happy in his world (in his world)

We're only making plans for Nigel
We only want what's best for him
We're only making plans for Nigel
Nigel just needs this helping hand

And if young Nigel says he's happy
He must be happy
He must be happy
He must be happy in his world

We're only making plans for Nigel
We only want what's best for him
We're only making plans for Nigel
Nigel just needs this helping hand

We're only making plans for Nigel
He has his future in a British steel

We're only making plans for Nigel
Nigel, Nigel, Nigel,...
