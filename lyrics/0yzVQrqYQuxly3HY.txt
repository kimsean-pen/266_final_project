Under the moonlight
Weathering with your warm embrace
I feel so safe here
Baby, we're worth the wait

Yeah, I picked the wrong kind
Time after time I drank from the poisoned wine
Yeah, I picked the wrong kind
But baby, you're alright, yeah baby, I've seen the light

I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Danger is coming, a danger is coming, a danger is coming, oh
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
The war has been won here, the war has been won here, oh

Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze
I know that I'd take one million bullets, babe
Yeah, one million bullets could come my way
But I want you to know that I'd take a million, babe

How many would you take?
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
How many would you take?

'Cause I'd take one million bullets, babe

If you were a poet, and I was a faultless muse
If you were the hero, yeah, I'd take a bullet for you
So take me in your arms, take me for all I have
'Cause I'd give my life for one of your belly laughs

I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Danger is coming, a danger is coming, a danger is coming, oh
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
The war has been won here, the war has been won here, oh

Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze
I know that I'd take one million bullets, babe
Yeah, one million bullets should come my way
But I want you to know that I'd take a million, babe

How many would you take?
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
How many would you take?

'Cause I'd take one million bullets, babe
