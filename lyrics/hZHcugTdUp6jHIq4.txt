Mmm, you want someone to blame?
The one who drives the Rusted Nail?
But whose left will make it
Pretending becomes a chore

Oh, you search for, a little peace of mind
Too far, too deep, the two faced smile
So lost, you feel, I know

Wide awake, but still asleep,
Awaits the stranger in the crowd
(Sleep, Sleep, Sleep)
Wide awake, always the stranger in the crowd
(A-wake, Wake, Wake)

Just, this once, listen to the words, I say
If you want, on will i'm there
Until the end of time

Leave, the doomed, behind
Search with different light
You was trying to remember
But It's all make believe
You are, you are, you are

Wide awake but still asleep (wide awake but still asleep)
Always the stranger in a crowd!

Just, this once, listen to the words, I say
If you want, on will i'm there
Until the end of time!

Just this once, listen to the words, I say
If you want, I'm there
Just this once, listen to the words, I say
If you want, on will i'm there
Until the end of time!
