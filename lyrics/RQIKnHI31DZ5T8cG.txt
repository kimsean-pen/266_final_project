Huh?
Ooh, Bighead on the beat
Aye, Lil Pump, Lil Pump, Lil Pump, Aye
Ronny J, bitch

I got designer from head to my toe
I'm on a Xan and my bitch on the coke
I got Givenchy all over my coat
I'm off that X and I just poured a 4
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean

Lil Pump rich, he finna get richer
I pop a bean, and fuck on your sister
Nut on her lip, and then you'll kiss her
Ice on my neck, it lookin' like glitter (brrr brrr)
I got designer from head to my feet (ooh)
I pop a X, so you know I be geek (damn)
Rocking Balmains and they all on my jeans (ooh)
I'm off the xans and I pour me some lean (Lil Pump)
I sell your mama some crack, she a fiend (huh?)
I crash the Porsche and I just left the scene (brrr)
Dripping designer, Burberry my sweater
Lil Pump pull up (brrr brrr), he changin' the weather
I pop a molly, I pop a bean
I fuck your bitch 'cause she down for the team
Jump in a car and hit you with the beam (huh)
I chug a pint and I just go to sleep

I got designer from head to my toe
I'm on a Xan and my bitch on the coke
I got Givenchy all over my coat
I'm off that X and I just poured a 4
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean

I got designer from head to my toe
I'm on a Xan and my bitch on that coke
I got Givenchy all over my coat
I'm off that X and I just poured a 4
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
