Eight years old, couple cane poles sittin' down by the creek
Lines in the water, watchin' those bobbers, seein' that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yellin' "Supper's hot! Ya'll come and get it!"
We yelled: "Five more minutes"
At sixteen, it was 12:03 standin' at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight but we needed just a little more
Yellow light flippin' on and off interuptin' that good night kissin'
We wanted five more minutes

Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Ah, but they just keep on flyin' right on by
Like it ain't nothin'
I wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

At eighteen turned my helmet in and walked to the fifty yard line
Just the coach and me after we lost eighteen to nine
And I cried man next time to get in here I'll have to buy a ticket
"Can't you give me five more minutes?"

Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Ah, but they just keep on flyin' right on by
Like it ain't nothin'
I wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

At eighty-six my grandpa said there's angels in the room
All the family gathered 'round we knew the time was comin' soon
With so much left to say I prayed: "Lord I ain't finished"
"Just give us five more minutes"
Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flyin' right on by
Like it ain't nothin'
I wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Yeah sometimes this ole life will leave you wishin'
That you had five more minutes

Five
More
Minutes
