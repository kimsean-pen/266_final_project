Dear diary, my dear
Got to keep it all inside
Got to keep it locked behind
A golden wall of silence

You see I have my pride
And I won? t be telling him
Anytime soon, too afraid to say it
I wouldn't wanna embarrass myself
Telling everybody the truth

(No I)
I won? t send this valentine
(Oh I)
Violets are blue
(I won? t send it)

And if you don? t receive this valentine
(I won't pretend it)
Doesn't mean it ain't true
And I? m not thinking of you

Won? t kiss, I won? t tell
Never cross these lips
Never break the spell
Decided to go on denying myself
Living alone, living a lie

(No I)
I won? t send this valentine
(Oh I)
Violets are blue
(I won? t send it)

And if you don? t receive this valentine
(I won't pretend it)
Doesn't mean it ain't true
And I? m not thinking of you

(Oh I)
I keep living a lie
(Oh I)
I keep living a lie

(No I)
I keep living a lie
(Oh I)
I keep living a lie

To never speak of it
Or hear the music of it
We? ll play a symphony
In my wildest dreams

(No I)
I won? t send this valentine
(Oh I)
Violets are blue
(I won? t send it)

And if you don? t receive this valentine
(I won't pretend it)
Doesn't mean it ain't true
And I? m not thinking of you

(No I)
I won? t send this valentine
(Oh I)
Violets are blue
(I won? t send it)

And if you don? t receive this valentine
(I won't pretend it)
Doesn't mean it ain't true
And I? m not thinking of you

I keep living a lie
I keep living a lie
I keep living a lie
I keep living a lie

I keep living a lie
I keep living a lie
I keep living a lie
I keep living a lie

I won? t send this valentine
Violets are blue
And if you don? t receive this valentine
