A wallflower punch talks to Judy
In a crowded corner where anybody can listen in
But they don't read page to page or speak easy
Now they're gonna go say the words
In the wrong order again

They walk in a circle
Through all the sidewalk scenes they used to be apart of one time
Now everybody just stares and whispers
Driving around up and down Division Street
I used to like it here
It just bums me out to remember

Can't you ever treat anyone nice
I think I'm gonna make the same mistake twice
They draw the curtain, wait for a call
Pretty lucky if they get any kind of response at all

Can't you ever treat anyone nice
I think I'm gonna make the same mistake twice
I'm gonna make the same mistake twice
