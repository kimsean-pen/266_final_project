La la la
La la la
La la la...

I got on a boat on a hot sunny day
To get out of this town
But the tarmac was melting and the people seemed to sway
Stuck in the underground

To the isle of (?) rainclouds and (?) wishing tree
I wanna be with you
On the slow boat that lands on misty sea
I wanna be with you

I pulled out the harbour with precession behind
and I'm feeling the love of you
So you better get to charge until I see you again
You know just what to do

If you're caught up in the junk boat sea
I wanna be with you
On a hill where the mountains are high trapeze
I wanna be with you

Ooh, nah nah, aaaah

If you're a landlord, the social (?)
I wanna be with you
On an isle of regret/rainclouds & (?) seas
I will be there with you

Ooh

La la la
La la la
La la la...
I wanna be with you

La la la
La la la
La la la...
I wanna be with you
