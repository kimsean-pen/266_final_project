Dearest - though you're the nearest to my heart
Please don't ever - umm ya
Ever say we'll part

You scold and you were so bold
Yes together - umm ya
Our love will grow old - umm ya
Our love will grow old

You may be a million miles away
Please believe me - umm ya
When you hear me say
I love you - I love you

Come home - keep me from these sleepless nights
Try my love again - umm ya
I'm gonna treat you right - umm ya
I'm gonna treat you right
