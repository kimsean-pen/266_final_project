If you're commin' with me you need nerves of steel.
'Cuz I take corners on two wheels.
It's a never - ending circus ride!
The faint of heart need not apply.

CHORUS:
Mi vida loca,
Over and over
Destiny turns on a dime.
I go where the wind blows,
You can't tame a wild rose.
Welcome to my crazy life!

Sweetheart, before this night is through,
I could fall in love with you.
Come dancin' on the edge with me.
Let my passion set you free.

CHORUS:
Mi vida loca,
Over and over
Destiny turns on a dime.
I go where the wind blows,
You can't tame a wild rose.
Welcome to my crazy life!

BRIDGE:
Here in the firelight I see your tattoo,
"Mi Vida Loco"
So you're crazy too!

Mi vida loca,
Over and over
Destiny turns on a dime
I go where the wind blows,
You can't tame a wild rose.
Welcome to my crazy life!
We'll go where the wind blows,
And I'll be your wild rose.
Welcome to my crazy life!
