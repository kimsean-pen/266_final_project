Time is just a means to an end
Who are you to decide since it all comes down on me?
I can end your suffering so
Take my hand I'll never let go

Here I am, I've come for you
Look me in the eyes and,
tell me your name
You and I will go away
You have seen the sun rise,
for the last time

The circle of life gives all to you
Who must relinquish for the circle of life
What for you is sorely brief
Is my everlasting chore
Take my hand I'll never let go

Here I am, I've come for you
Look me in the eyes and,
tell me your name
You and I will go away
You have seen the sun rise,
for the last time

(Flauto)

You and I, at the and of time
You and I, step out of the light
You and I, at the end of time
You and I, step out of the light
You'll be mine, You'll be mine

I can end your suffering so
Take my hand I'll never let go

Here I am, I've come for you
Look me in the eyes and,
tell me your name
You and I will go away
You have seen the sun rise,
for the last time...
