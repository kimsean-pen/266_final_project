If I'd been a prophet I would tell you how the future was
If I'd been a phoenix, raise us up through embers and flames

But together we wander
Through our blame but he didn't know
All we wanted for our love
Was a chance to let it grow

I prayed so hard the rain would pour
To calm down the flames but now they've grown
No loving is left
Stand in the wrong side
Of the sun

If I'd been a loaner I would save myself, stay unaware
If I'd been a dreamer I would float away in a dream

But the seasons, they were sleeping
And the fates were on our side
And only summer eternal
Never harvest or survive

I prayed so hard the rain would pour
To calm down the flames but now they're gone
No loving is left
Stand in the wrong side
Of the sun

We never thought to keep pushing it
We thought the sun would be forever long
She took him til the colors faded
And it was too late then to run and hide

I prayed so hard the rain would pour
To calm down the flames but now they've grown
Our love's over now
Oh how did it go so very wrong?

We watched as the heat slit through our skin
Our hearts to expose the end to them
No loving is left
Stand in the wrong side
Of the sun

No one here to say what's done is done
Standing on the wrong side of the sun
