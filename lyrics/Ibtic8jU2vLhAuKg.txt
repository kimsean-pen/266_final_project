You've only left a day ago
I'll sleep the night and then I'll know
I'll know your heart is safe in mine
But nightmares keep me up at night

I dream you've found another girl
To show and share your busy world
I dream of you, your secret style
And call to say everything's fine

It only takes one night
It only takes one night
It only takes one night
One night, one night

You've only left a day ago
I'll sleep the night and then I'll know
I'll know your heart is safe in mine
But nightmares keep me up at night

I'm pretty sure I know it's you
Of western steer and rotten girls
The faceless Coco, Jenny, Jane
He isn't home to feel this rage

It only takes one night
It only takes one night
It only takes one night
One night, one night

Don't forget me
Don't forget me
Don't forget me, baby

I dream you've found another girl
To show and share your busy world
I dream of you, your secret style
And call to say everything's fine

It only takes one night
It only takes one night
It only takes one night
One night, one night
