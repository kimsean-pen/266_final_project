High above the mucky-muck
Castle made of clouds
There sits Wonderboy
Sitting oh-so-proudly
Not much to say
When you're high above the mucky-muck
Yeaaah, yeah

Wonderboy
What is the secret of your power
Wonderboy
Won't you take me far away from the mucky-muck, man

Now it's time for me to tell you about Young Nastyman
Arch-rival and nemesis of Wonderboy
With powers comparable to Wonderboy

What powers you ask
I dunno, how about the power of flight
That do anything for ya
It's levitation, Holmes
How about the power to kill a yak
From 200 yards away
With mind bullets
That's telekinesis Kyle
How about the power to move you

History of Wonderboy and Young Nastyman
Rigga goo-goo, rigga goo-goo
A secret to be told
A gold chest to be bold
And blasting forth with three-part harmony
Yow

Wonderboy
What is the secret of your power
Wonderboy
Won't you take me far away from the mucky-muck, man

Well Wonderboy and Young Nastyman joined forces
They formed a band
The likes of which have never been seen
And they call themselves Tenacious D
That's right, me
And KG (that's me)
Were now
Tenacious D
Come fly with me, fly

Wonderboy
What is the secret of your power
Wonderboy
Won't you take me far away from the mucky-muck, man

Oh, take my hand
Young Nastyman
And we'll fly
Bring out your broad sword
There's the hydra
Slice his throat
And grab his scrote
You take the high road
I'll take the low
There, the crevasse
Fill it
With your mighty juice
