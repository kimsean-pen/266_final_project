Frankie died just the other night
Some say it was suicide
But we know how the story goes

With his six string knife and his streetwise pride
The boy was a man before his time
And she knew all their dreams would come true

But you see, Frankie was fast, he was too fast to know
He wouldn't go slow until his lethal dose
And she knows he'll finally come too close

Well, on with the show, going on with the show
Come on baby, no, no, no, no
Oh my, my, my, my, my, my

Well, on with the show, going on with the show
Come on baby, no, no, no, no
Oh my, my, my, my, my, my

He was bad, he was never good
But one thing that he understood
And she knew all those lies would come true

The time has come and he paid his dues
Suzy finally got the news
She always knew this day would come soon

Well, on with the show, going on with the show
Come on baby, no, no, no, no
Oh my, my, my, my, my, my

Well, on with the show, going on with the show
Come on baby, no, no, no, no
Oh my, my, my, my, my, my

He was stopped on a dime with a switchblade knife
Some damn punk went and took Frankie's life
And she knew she'd have to pull through

Broken down with his broken dreams
With a wink of an eye said Suzy, "Listen to me
You must go on with the show"
Go on with the show, going on with the show
Come on baby, no, no, no, no
Oh my, my, my, my, my, my
Go on with the show, going on with the show
Come on baby, no, no, no, no
Oh my, my, my, my, my, my
Well, on with the show, going on with the show
Come on baby, no, no, no, no
Oh my, my, my, my, my, my, oh baby
