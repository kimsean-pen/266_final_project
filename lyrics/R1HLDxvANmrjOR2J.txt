New York isn't New York
Without you, love
So far in a few blocks
To be so low

And if I call you from First Avenue
Where you're the only motherfucker in the city
Who can handle me

New love
Wasn't true love
Back to you, love
So much for a home run
With some blue bloods

If I last-strawed you on 8th Avenue
Where you're the only motherfucker in the city
Who can stand me

I have lost a hero
I have lost a friend
But for you, darling
I'd do it all again

I have lost a hero
I have lost a friend
But for you, darling
I'd do it all again

New York isn't New York
Without you, love

Too few of our old crew
Left on Astor
So if I trade our 'hood
For some Hollywood

Where the only motherfucker in the city who would
The only motherfucker in the city who would
The only motherfucker in the city who'd forgive me

I have lost a hero
I have lost a friend
But for you, darling
I'd do it all again

I have lost a hero
I have lost a friend
But for you, darling
I'd do it all again
