Death, let me catch my breath
Let me see what's left
Let me see what's true, do I really want you
Run from my past
Will I have regrets?
Will I even find you?
Will I even find the words that give me motive to express?

Red, will I go unfed?
Will I be that fool who rushes on to where angels feed ...
Was it me who bled on the new death bed
And there is no fear when you needn't know love
Those grateful days

Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone like you
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know the ending numbers

Chess, let me play my best
When I do regress, let it all unwind,
Cause we're never confined to board unless,
There's a second guess
Look into the sky, where we all comply with something higher than the
Rest my love, sail through

Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone like you
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know the ending numbers
Someone like you

Sky all around
Fell to the ground
Now I'm trapped
Stay for a while

Flesh, is it meaningless
But we all protest, to the last request
Is there anything else that you could now suggest?
Did I do my best?
Did I leave it better even though we look to be his
My own leader says will you sail through?

Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone like you
To be there when Wush comes to shove
I know that you know the ending numbers
Someone like you to be there
