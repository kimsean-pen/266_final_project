I, won't, say, I'm, in, love
when you call me
I, know, I'm, not, the, one
when you're stalling
I can take a walk where I can't hear
the rumble of a force that keeps them near
they say they make your thoughts come true
see me when you're free, I'll make you quit
the feelings that you seek, it makes me sick
I wanna see you miss and lose

step your mark over the line
I know you're working all the time
try to pull wool cross your eyes
trying hard to simplify

the wounds
that you house
that you keep
thereabouts
in the deep
in the back
with your friends
you're the best
in the end

I, see, the, way, you, say
that you miss her
l, get, that, restless, taste
when I get spurned
I just want a year that I dictate
a silly little care to keep them sane
until my fears come rushing back
you could show me things, that make me shout
I wonder if that's how you see me now
I guess it's good I never cracked

step your mark over the line
I know you're working all the time
try to pull wool cross your eyes
trying hard to simplify

the wounds
that you house
that you keep
thereabouts
in the deep
in the back
with your friends
you're the best
in the end
