It feels like lately I've been living with a stranger
Where all my words are lost and gone into the vapors
I tried to reach you but your love is like a desert
Waiting for your touch feels like I'm living without water
I just want to know
If you aren't for me then why do I breathe so slow
Every time you go
I drop to my knees
I can't even breathe so
Is it real or should I go
You got me chasing promises on the horizon
They come and go, oh these visions come and go
And I keep chasing knowing I will never find it
Visions come and go
Visions come and go
This love is a ghost, oh, this love's a ghost
This love is a ghost, love is like a ghost
You pass me by and I can feel the distance growing
I'd jump a canyon just to get to where you're going
I just want to know
If you aren't for me then why do I breathe so slow
Every time you go
I drop to my knees
I can't even breathe so...
Is it real or should I go
You got me chasing promises on the horizon
They come and go
All these visions come and go
And I keep chasing knowing I will never find it
Visions come and go
Visions come and go
This love is a ghost, oh, this love's a ghost
This love is a ghost, love is like a ghost
You got me chasing promises on the horizon
They come and go
All these visions come and go
And I keep chasing knowing I will never find it
Visions come and go
Visions come and go
This love is a ghost, oh, this love's a ghost
This love is a ghost love is like a ghost
