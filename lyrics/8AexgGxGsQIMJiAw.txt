The valkyries

Odin
Far wanderer
Grant me wisdom, courage and victory

Now the web is woven
And the weapons reddened
In all lands will be heard with warriors' blood
The Valkyries

Now the web is woven
And the weapons reddened
In all lands will be heard with warriors' blood
The Valkyries

Far wanderer
Grant me wisdom, courage and victory
The Valkyries
