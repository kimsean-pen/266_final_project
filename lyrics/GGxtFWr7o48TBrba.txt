You give 'em
Now take 'em
Knock them all down
I keep myself up

There's something I'm trying to say, trying to prove
I don't know which one I'm trying to do
Either way, it's no use

Bigger the better
Harder they fall
Save 'em for later
Try to hold them all

There's something I'm trying to say, trying to prove
I don't know which one I'm trying to do
Either way, it's no use

I have my ship
That's what I want(?)
Coming for a shell(?)
For I'm in love

There's something I'm trying to say, trying to prove
I don't know which one I'm trying to do
Either way, it's no use
