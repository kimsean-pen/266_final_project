For your own good
call me tonight
Don't you think you should
call me tonight?
Life isn't easy
so why don't you stay
with the lover you need
and not the devil you pay?
For your own good
call me tonight

For your own good
call me tonight
Don't you think I could
make a difference tonight?
When you need a lover
and it's so cold outside
I could help you recover
from pain that you hide
Life isn't easy
so why don't you stay
with the lover you need
and not the devil you pay?
For your own good
Call me tonight

Come on, call me

Call me tonight
I'll make you feel good
Come on, call me
Come on, call me
Call me tonight
I'll make you feel good
Want your body
Want your body

Come on, call me
Come on, call me

For your own good
call me tonight
