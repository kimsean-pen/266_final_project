Save me from possibility
'Cause lately you're just a memory
I've gotta pull myself together
'Cause you've been tearing me apart
You've got deceit down to a science
But you make it look like such an art
Take this to heart
If you have one

I hope you float 'cause your ship is sinking
I'll bet you're set on your wishful thinking
I'll sit back and watch you fall
When you thought you had it all
'Cause your buying time that you can't afford
And we're going overboard

Breaking hearts like breaking habits
I turn my back and then you stab it
But I'll find something here
Aside from all these wasted years
I hope your anchor pulls you down
Just long enough for you to drown
'Cause you've been burning bridges far too fast
Treading water with your sails at half-mast
So save your breath
'Cause it's over
I hope you float 'cause your ship is sinking
I'll bet you're set on your wishful thinking
I'll sit back and watch you fall
When you thought you had it all
'Cause your buying time that you can't afford
And we're going overboard
We're going overboard
I hope you float 'cause your ship is sinking
I'll bet you're set on your wishful thinking
I'll sit back and watch you fall
When you thought you had it all
'Cause your buying time that you can't afford
And we're going overboard
I hope you float 'cause your ship is sinking
I'll bet you're set on your wishful thinking
I'll sit back and watch you fall
When you thought you had it all
'Cause your buying time that you can't afford
And we're going overboard
We're going overboard
