Please leave
Just make it easier on me
Mind in a jar and it's easy to see
That all I want for you is to bleed on me

Green is the color of power and greed
But now blood red is the only thing I can see
Live like a loser, die like a king
Ugly is the only way I know how to be

All I want is to finally concede
That the way that I've been thinking's not the best way to be
That the way I've been living makes it harder to breathe
That my instincts might not be as sound as they seem

Green is the color of power and greed
But now blood red is the only thing I can see
Live like a loser, die like a king
Ugly is the only way I know how to be

Ugly
Ugly
Ugly

Lay me on the grass
Put me to bed
Get these sick, sad thoughts
Out of my head

Ugly
Ugly

Ugly
Ugly
Ugly

Green is the color of power and greed
But now blood red is the only thing I can see
Live like a loser, die like a king
Ugly is the only way I know how to be

Green is the color of power and greed
But now blood red's the only thing I can see
Live like a loser, die like a king
Ugly is the only way I know how to be

Ugly
