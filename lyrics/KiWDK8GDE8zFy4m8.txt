Squeaky swings and tall grass.
The longest shadows ever cast.
The water's warm and children swim.
And we frolliced about in our summer skin.
I don't recall a single care.
Just cre-ory and human hair.
Then labor day came and went.
And we shed what was left of our summer skin.
On the night you left, I came over.
And we peeled the freckles from our shoulders.
Our brand new coats, so flushed and pink.
And I knew your heart I couldn't lift.
Cause the season's change was a conduit.
And we left our love in our summer skin.
