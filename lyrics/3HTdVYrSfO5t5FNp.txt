All the colors of
All the colors of
The pretty colors of
Two fifty six billions swirling all of fearless love
A different level of
A different kind of drug
My eyes are opened
Down the scope looking from up above

Vivid, cosmic distillations
Saturate my mind
ambiguous hallucinations
in and out of time

Kaleidoscope
Kaleidoscope
Billions become one in my

Kaleidoscope
Kaleidoscope
This is who we are

And this xxxxx swirl
Interconnected world
Geometry that secret vibrate in
So you can twirl
Is it a boy or girl?
Unravel and unfold
See it in Technicolor
Perfectly symmetrical

Vivid, cosmic distillations
Saturate my mind
ambiguous hallucinations
in and out of time

Kaleidoscope
Kaleidoscope
Billions become one in my

Kaleidoscope
Kaleidoscope
This is who we are

Kaleidoscope
This is who we are

Kaleidoscope

Kaleidoscope
This is who we are

Billions become one in my
Kaleidoscope

Kaleidoscope
This is who we are
