Now the path ahead is gone
Now the fight is really on
I can see real trouble if we wait
Don't hesitate

Annabel, have no fear
You can be my Guinevere
In the storm I will draw you close
In the tempest, in the snow

Now the fire is getting strong
Now the rules have been withdrawn
I can see destruction if we wait
Don't hesitate

Annabel, have no fear
You can be my Guinevere
In the storm I will draw you close
In the tempest, in the snow

In the storm I will draw your close
In the tempest, in the snow
In the storm I will draw you close
In the tempest, in the snow
