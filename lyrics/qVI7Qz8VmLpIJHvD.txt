Why again?
Narrow shadows
They dance on my skin
Falling deep
I'm fucking buried again
Look at me, chained
Bound by force I can't see
It's coming closer

I can't handle this
Just let me breathe

Eyeless still I feel it's gaze on me
Eyeless still I feel it's gaze on me

I craved to be free, I need to be free
The harder I fight
Deeper the nails sink in

Eyes roll back
The room begins to spin
Putrid visions won't leave me

They consume me, they consume me

The world is dust and so are you
Forever nothing
You can't pull through

The world is dust and so are you
Forever nothing
You can't pull through
