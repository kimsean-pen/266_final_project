He lives inside my mouth
and tells me what to say
when he turns the trains
on he makes it go away
the hands are cracked and dirty and
the nails are beetle wings
when he turns the trains on he
unties all of the strings

(the worm):"tell me something beautiful
tell me something free
tell me something beautiful
and I wish that I could be"
(then I got my wings and I never even knew it
when I was a worm thought I couldn't get through it)

(Jack)(not spoken): come, come
toys all smell like children
and the scab-knees will obey
I have to kneel on broomsticks
just to make it go away
[the inauguration of the worm]
(then I got my wings and I never even knew it,
when I was a worm thought I couldn't get through it)

(A voice we have not heard yet):"because
today is black
because
there is no turning back
because
your lies have watered me
I have
become the strongest weed...
weed..."

(through Jack's eyes): the taste of metal
disintegrator
three holes upon the leather belt
it's cut and swollen
the age is showing

(Boy):"there's no one here to save yourself"

(The disintegrator) (to himself):"this is what you should fear
you are what you should fear"
