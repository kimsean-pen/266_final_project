Let me be the one
You give your love to
Let me be the one
You give your love to

I hear your records on the radio
I see you talking on the late, late show
Every girl wants to be your friend
Don't you know you're always on my mind
Oh, how I've missed you since you hit the big time
Oh, I'm hurting... I just can't pretend

We used to be together
Makin' dreams
Makin' plans
But you left that world behind
Now I'm askin' you... won't you

Let me be the one
(Let me be)
You give your love to
(The love you need, baby)
Let me be the one
(Let me be)
You give your love to
(The one that turns your lovin' on)

I see the sadness in your eyes
Don't you get lonely baby, sometimes
Lonely for the love that we had
I'll be waiting when the day comes
When you need somebody won't you let me be the one
Come to me
Put yourself in my hands

We used to be together
Makin' dreams
Makin' plans
But you left that world behind
Now I'm askin' you... won't you

Let me be the one
(Let me be)
You give your love to
(The one you need, baby)
Let me be the one
(Let me be)
You give your love to
(The one that turns your lovin' on)
