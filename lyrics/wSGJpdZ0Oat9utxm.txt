Maybe life is better off this way
But what about the others who aren't here today
We struggle with the tide
Falling with our hearts
But then in my mind
No point in killing time

You better stop what you're doing
Before you do it all wrong again
You better stop what you're doing
Before you do it all wrong again

I have tried to put it from my mind
To bury all the trouble that I've left behind
But still I can't explain
The words I just can't find
And I can't understand it
Ain't nothing gonna change my mind

You better stop what you're doing
Before you do it all wrong again
You better stop what you're doing
Before you do it all wrong again

I know I may be young
And know nothing of this world
Oh Lord, it's been long
In its coming
I don't care if my words sound absurd
This play won't play this time

You better stop what you're doing
Before you do it all wrong again
You do it all wrong again
Stop what you're doing
You better stop what you're doing
Before you do it all wrong again
You do it all wrong again
You do it all wrong again

Can't get it out of my mind
Can't you see that I'm not blind
I can see what you're doing
Stop what you're doing
What will it take for you to recognize your mistake?
I was counting on you
But now I know you're just a first class fool

Stop what you're doing
Before you do it all wrong again
Stop what you're doing boy
Before you do it all wrong again
Stop what you're doing
Before you do it all wrong again
Get it right this time
First class fool, first class fool

Stop what you're doing
Before you do it all wrong again
You have to get it right this time
Before it gets all out of hand
