He had a reason to get back to Lake Charles
He used to talk about it
He'd just go on and on
He always said Louisana
Was where he felt at home

He was born in Nacogdoches
That's in East Texas
Not far from the border
But he liked to tell everybody
He was from Lake Charles

Did an angel whisper in your ear
And hold you close and take away your fear
In those long last moments?

We used to drive
Thru Lafayette and Baton Rouge
In a yellow El Camino
Listening to Howling Wolf
He liked to stop in Lake Charles
'Cause that's the place that he loved

Did you run about as far as you could go?
Down the Lousiana highway
Across Lake Ponchatrain
Now your soul is in Lake Charles
No matter what they say

Did an angel whisper in your ear
And hold you close and take away your fear
In those long last moments?
