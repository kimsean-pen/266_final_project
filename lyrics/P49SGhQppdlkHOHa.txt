We're doing it!

I look around me
But all I seem to see
Is people going nowhere
Expecting sympathy

It's like we're going through the motions
Of a scripted destiny
Tell me where's our inspiration
If life won't wait
I guess it's up to me

Woah
No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town
Woah
And won't come back the world is calling out
Woah
Leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company, well
So long, you'll miss me when I'm gone

Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Procrastination, running circles in my head
While you sit there contemplating
You wound up left for dead
(You left for dead)
Life is what happens while you're busy making your excuses
Another day, another casualty
But that won't happen to me

Woah
No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town
Woah
We won't come back the world is calling out
Woah
Leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company, well
So long, you'll miss me when I'm gone

Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
When I'm gone

Let's go

Won't look back
When I say goodbye
I'm gonna leave there is a hole behind me
Gonna take what's mine tonight
Because every wasted day becomes a wasted chance
You're gonna wake up feeling sorry
Because life won't wait
I guess it's up to you

Woah
No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town
Woah
We won't come back the world is calling out
Woah!
We'll leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company, well
So long, you'll miss me when I'm gone
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
