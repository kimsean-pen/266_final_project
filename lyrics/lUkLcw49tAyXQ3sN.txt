I know that this isn't out of the blue
And you can't tell me that you did not see this coming
I want to help you, but you are just too weak
What can be done?
I have played this over in my head so many times, too many times

You hold the air, escape the rain, this pain of death will last forever
You hold the air, a clouded view of this plan for the end

Mark my words, this wont count for a thing
You place the blame on everyone but yourself

And you find yourself ablaze
You fold the air
It's finally separated
This soul is off for you

And so back and forth for the last time, this fear is gone
Our last words wont celebrate the end of this jealous town, I know I wont come back
And you can't hold back the tears as you know that you have every reason to live
