Lay with me in the whisper of the night,
Like a tiny acorn I will keep you from sight,
My world is a turnstile, so I need you to hold,
GirlI'll never leave you, you remind me of gold

You put a chill in the heart of my soul

Lay with me in the middle of the fray,
If it wasn't for your love, I'd leave yesterday,
But my words are frozen in heaven so cold,
Girl I'll never leave you, you remind me of gold

You put a chill in the heart of my soul

The birds above my window, hear them sing and decay,
Jesus won't you come and save me from the blues this sunny day,
The Devil's smile is charming and he's calling my name,
Girl you know that lust is my favorite game...
