Time to rewind
Back to 1995 when we were nothing
Walking through the streets of Boston no one listening
No one caring about the empty rooms we played
Until they all showed up one for one day
Then we took the stage and everything changed

Turn that shit up louder!
Make it all go faster!
Play it through the witching hour!
Take it to one thousand horsepower! Yeah!

Under lights now
Playing to the masses everything feels right
Taking state by state by country over night
Living in a shell entering every fight
Seeing millions of people rage
When we take our stage, everybody scream

Turn that shit up louder!
Make it all go faster!
Play it through the witching hour!
Take it to one thousand horsepower! Yeah!

Turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up, and feel alive
Turn it up turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up, and feel alive
Turn it up turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up, and feel alive
Turn it up turn it up one more time
Get it up get it up, and feel alive! Yeah!

Turn that shit up louder!
Make it all go faster!
Play it through the witching hour! Yeah!
Take it to one thousand horsepower!

Turn that shit up louder!
Make it all go faster!
Play it through the witching hour! Yeah!
Take it to one thousand horsepower!
