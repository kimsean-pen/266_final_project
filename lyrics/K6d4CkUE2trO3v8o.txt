Scars we carry

Carry with memories
Memories burned by the dark
Try to see clearly
Tears we bury
Bury in vain
Cause the pain got us falling apart

Try to see clearly
Now let the healing start
The fire is out of guns
We keep it in our hearts
We're like a thousand suns
Ooh, yeah

Everyday step by step
We dare to love again
And if we lose our grips
Meet you at the end
Know they're cutting you deep
Feel the scars in your sleep

What didn't kill made us made us stronger
Stories left on our skin
Wear them with everything

What didn't kill us made us stronger
Oh
Don't feel lonely
Loneliness kills all the thrill from standing alone
Oh
Try to see clearly

Now let the healing start
The fire is out of guns
We keep it in our hearts
We're like a thousand suns
Ooh, yeah
Everyday step by step
We dare to love again
And if we lose our grips
Meet you at the end
Know they are cutting you deep
Feel the scars in your sleep
What didn't kill us made us stronger

Stories left on our skin
Wear them with everything
What didn't kill us made us stronger
Know they are cutting you deep
Feel the scars in your sleep
What didn't kill us made us stronger

Stories left on our skin
Wear them with everything
What didn't kill us make us stronger
Feet don't fail me now (no)
What didn't kill us made
What didn't kill us made us stronger
Feet don't fail me now
What didn't kill us made
What didn't kill us made us stronger
Scars we carry
