I read the papers this morning
I saw your photograph
You look good in the movie
It must be so much fun.

Letter from Spain
From someone I once knew
Letter from Spain.

I got a letter this morning
(You're doing very well)
Postmark said it was from Spain
(Never thought you'd had the time)
Your writing is so very strange
(To think there meaning right)
I guess it always was that way
(I'm glad you're doing fine).
