I called you late again
Did it to wake you up
Don't fall asleep again
I'm just arriving

Oh oh (oh oh)
I've seen it before (before)
I had a friend who called it misunderstanding
Oh oh (oh oh)
It's nothing at all (at all)
You and your friend we've got a good understanding

I'll make another call
Oh you never know
I'll make another call
Oh you never know
Are we planning on the long weekend
Trying to make the call again
Oh you never know
I'll make another call
Oh you never know

Are we underneath the mantelpiece
Covered up in magazines
You will found the thing your heart desires
I can understand your pain
Living on your own again
It's always half-empty in your cup, fill it up now

Oh oh (oh oh)
I've seen it before (before)
I had a friend who called it misunderstanding
Oh oh (oh oh)
It's nothing at all (at all)
You and your friend we've got a good understanding

We can recall when we get to my house
We can recall when we get to my house
We can recall when we get to my house
We can recall when we get to my house

Yeah, I love my house
(My house, my house)
