Medicine man, you dance me across the country
Medicine man, you dance me across the sky
Medicine man, now my feet are dragging
Medicine man, can you hear my cry?

I don't wanna be
The one, the one, the one
That you forget
I don't, I don't, I don't
Just want to be your regret

Medicine man, I lay my head in your hands
Medicine man, you will clear my mind
Medicine man, can you heal my body?
Medicine man, can you hear my cry?

I don't wanna be
The one, the one, the one
That you forget
I don't, I don't, I don't
Just want to be your regret

I don't know where to begin
I don't know how to break
The bottle I'm living in
Do anything to take away
The memory of him
Can't you see that I have no way out
From leaving now?

Medicine man, clear my mind
Medicine man, whoa
Medicine man, hear my cry
Medicine man, no
Medicine man, you are here in my mind
Medicine man, oh
Medicine man, hear my cry
Medicine man, whoa
Medicine man, medicine man
Medicine man, whoa
