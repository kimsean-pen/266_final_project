First I'll acknowledge
Our trust has been broken
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night

Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right

Make it right
Make it right
Make it right
This time I'll do you right
Woooooooah woah, wooooooooaaah

Missin' your good intentions
Missin' you from a distance
Hope you did the same

I know that I caused a problem
Know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away

Learned it don't pay to lie
Costs more to see you cry
Sayin' nothing gets you nowhere fast
I'mma hold it back inside

Well now that I'm back around ya
Nothing else really matters
Hope you feel the same

First I'll acknowledge
Our trust has been broken
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night

Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right

Make it right
Make it right
Make it right
This time I'll do you right
Woooooooah woah, wooooooooaaah

Goin' through all the motions
Tryna find a reason
Why we ended that way

Nothin' in life is perfect
When you're changing like the seasons
That's what they used to say

Cause goin' to sleep alone at night
I don't wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give
No more holdin' back this time

Now that I'm back around ya
Nothin' around me matters
Hope ya feel the same

First I'll acknowledge
Our trust has been broken
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night

Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right
Make it right (make it right, make it right)
Make it right (make it right, make it right)
Make it right (make it right, make it right)
This time I'll do you right
Woooooooah woah, wooooooooaaah
You know I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
