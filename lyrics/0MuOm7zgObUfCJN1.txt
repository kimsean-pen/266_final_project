Awakened and cast into fleshbound pain
Into a tragedy of pointless games.
False structures of bondage are presented
And clothe our attempts for understanding.
Fables become fear ridden ideals
And aspersions are taken as truth.
Coerced to join this nonsensical farce.
Beset on all sides by shadows in constant motion
In this reality without a name.
How can one not laugh at this awkward organism?
How can one not ridicule the vanity?
