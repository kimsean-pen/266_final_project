(Come up and be a kite)

Beelzebub is aching in my belly-o.
My feet are heavy and I'm rooted in my wellios
And I want to get away and go

(I wanna be)

From all these

(I wanna be home)

Mirror windows.

I look at eye level, it isn't good enough.
And then I find it out when I take a good look up.
There's a hole in the sky

(there's a hole in the)

With a big eyeball

(there's a hole in the sky)

Calling me:

"Come up and be a kite,
And fly a diamond night!
A diamond kite, a diamond kite.
Ooh, what a diamond!

"A diamond kite
On a diamond flight.
Over the lights, under the moon.
Over the lights, under the moon.
Over the moon, over the moon!"

(Come up and be a kite)

I feel a rush along my body, like a bullet.
I'm 2-D after a push-and-pull feeling.
And I want to get back to

(I wanna be)

Safe home.

(I wanna be home)

I love the homeland dome.

I got no limbs, I'm like a feather on the wind.
Well, I'm not sure if I want to be up here, at all.
And I'd like to be

(I'd like to be)

Back on the ground,

(I'd like to be down)

But I don't know how to get down, down, down!

"Come up and be a kite,
And fly a diamond night!
A diamond kite, a diamond kite.
Ooh, what a diamond!

"A diamond kite
On a diamond flight.
Over the lights, oooh, under the moon.
Over the lights, oooh, under the moon.
Over the moon, over the moon!"

(Come up and be a kite)
