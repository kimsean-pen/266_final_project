I always knew that he existed in the depths of my heart,
Silently preparing to tear me apart,
Defining who I am and what we are,
It was the hate in our hearts that got us this far.
We created the devil just to see our brothers burn in hell.
We created god to be forgiven for the blood that we have spilled.
There is no solution, We are the pollution,
There is no solution to madness,
There's only one way to end this,
Kill yourself if you want to rid the world of evil.
I always knew that he existed in the depths of
my heart, Silently preparing to tear me apart,
Defining who I am and what we are It was
the hate in our hearts that got us this far.
The greatest trick the devil ever pulled
was convincing the world that he doesn't exist.
He exists in is all!
We created the devil just to see our brothers burn in hell.
We created god to be forgiven for the blood that we have spilled.
I always knew that he existed in the depths of my heart.
Silently preparing to tear me apart,
Defining who I am and what we are,
It was the hate in our hearts that got us this far.
There is no solution, We are the pollution,
There is no solution to madness, There's only one way to end this.
Â¡Kill yourself!
