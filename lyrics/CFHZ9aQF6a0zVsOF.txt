I don't want to lose my head
I don't want to sell my soul
Feel it taking over, Feel the pressure creep in
I don't want to waste my time
I don't want to lose control
One thing you remember
In the end you'll know my name

I just want to scream
That nothing's what it seems
I'll just keep believing
One day I'll be king
Say it loud enough
I ain't going nowhere
You can't break me down
One day, one day I'll be king

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Never been a perfect time
Never in the state of mind
Waiting for the moment, keep the fire burning
I don't want to lose my way
Took me so long to find
One thing you remember
In the end you'll know my name

I just want to scream
That nothing's what it seems
I'll just keep believing
One day I'll be king
Say it loud enough
I ain't going nowhere
You can't break me down
One day, one day I'll be king

Oh, oh, oh, oh

I control my destiny
I'm not the man I used to be
Tonight it's here for everyone to see
I will be king...

I just want to scream
That nothing's what it seems
I'll just keep believing
One day I'll be king
Say it loud enough
I ain't going nowhere
You can't break me down
One day, one day I'll be king

Oh, oh, oh, oh
