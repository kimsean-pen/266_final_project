When my hope is lost and my strength is gone
I run to You, and You alone
When I can't get up, and I can't go on
I run to You, and You alone

'Cause You're my light in the dark
And I sing with all of my heart

Hallelujah, my almighty God divine
Hallelujah, I am Yours and You are mine
This is all I know how to say
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You're my everything

When I'm plagued with pain, and filled with fear
I run to You, and You alone
When my days are few, and death is near
I run to You, and You alone

'Cause You're my light in the dark
And I sing with all of my heart

Hallelujah, my almighty God divine
Hallelujah, I am Yours and You are mine
This is all I know how to say
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

When trouble comes and goes
And when the cold wind blows
I lift my hands up
I lift my hands up
When sorrow knocks me down
And You pick me off the ground
I lift my hands up
I lift my hands up
And I sing...

Hallelujah, my almighty God divine
Hallelujah, I am Yours and You are mine
This is all I know how to say

Hallelujah, by the grace of God above
Hallelujah, I shine a light 'cause I am loved
This is all I know how to say
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
This is all I know how to say
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You're my everything
Oh-oh, You're my everything
