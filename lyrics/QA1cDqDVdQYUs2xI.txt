If snow is flesh in gardens
We don't have mouths to talk about it

Between avalanches we can find our language
Between fire blankets we can speak our language

But if snow is like skin
It pulls away so easy
Right from the body
What if all stripped wood is branches
And all frozen lakes are water
Then our bodies will be avalanches
Then our bodies will be avalanches
