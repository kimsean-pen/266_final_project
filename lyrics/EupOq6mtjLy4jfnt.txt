This time i think you pointed right at you
Whose side are you on
Whose side are you on
I ask you what side, you pointed it out
What side are you on
What side are you on

A waste of time
If you don't believe
Can't decide to
Hit the ground
Make your mind
But you're holding me down
And over again
Down
And over again
Down

This time i think you pointed right at you
Whose side are you on
Whose side are you on
I ask you what side, you pointed it out
What side are you on
What side are you on

A waste of time
If you don't believe
Can't decide till you've
Hit the ground
Make your mind
Or you dont believe
Can't decide till you
Hit the ground
Make your mind
Cause you're holding me down
Down
And over again
Down
And over again
Down
And over again

And dont think that i dont know
Because i do, nice try,
Cause thats what your really like, like, like, like...

This all came out, you said,
Say something else.
Decide, who's side you're on.

Who's side are you on?
Who's side are you on?
Come on!
Who's side are you on?
Who's side are you on?

Who's side are you on?
Who's side are you on?
Who's side are you on?
Who's side are you on?

Who's side you on?
