Too much horror business
Driving late at night
Psycho seventy-eight
My bathroom is new
You, you don't go in the bathroom with me

Psycho seventy-eight
Twelve o'clock, don't be late
All this horror business
My mirrors are black
You don't go in the bathroom with me

With you
I'll put a knife right in you
I'm warning you
I'll put a knife right in you
I'm warning you
I'll put a knife right in you

Too much horror business
Driving late at night
Psycho seventy-eight
My bathroom is new for you
You don't go in the bathroom with me

Psycho seventy-eight
I'm talking about
I'm talking about
Twelve o'clock, don't be late
I say, all this horror business
My mirrors are black for you
You don't go in the bathroom with me

With you
I'll put a knife right in you
I'm warning you
I'll put a knife right in you
I'm warning you
I'll put a knife right in you
I'm warning you
I'll put a knife right in you
I'm warning you

You, nobody can do
What I can do, no
