Been looking all over for someone like you
Now that I've found him I go find you
Never been here before
I don't know what to do
Searching is over and now
There's two of you
No tomorrow, no today
And not another time
No need you to hang around

It's a bad time for a good time
That's why this love won't happen
It's a bad time not a good time
All boys when I don't need 'em
It's a bad time for a good time
That's why this love won't happen
It's a bad time no not a good time
All boys when I don't need 'em

Look at all the good looking people around
They try to compete with what
I already found
What to do my friend, you could have
been the one but I will not pretend
Been looking all over for someone like you
No tomorrow, no today and not another time
No need to hang around

It's a bad time for a good time
That's why this love won't happen
It's a bad time not a good time
All boys when I don't need 'em
It's a bad time for a good time
That's why this love won't happen
It's a bad time no not a good time
All boys when I don't need 'em

No tomorrow, no today and
Not another time
No need to hang around
No tomorrow, no today and
Not another time
No tomorrow, no today and
Not another time
No need to stick around
Not tomorrow, not today
Not another time

It's a bad time for a good time
That's why this love won't happen
It's a bad time not a good time
All boys when I don't need 'em
It's a bad time for a good time
That's why this love won't happen
It's a bad time no not a good time
All boys when I don't need 'em
