I can't love in a city like this
Caught up in the moments where I don't exist
Do I recall what I'm supposed to know
My heart beats fast but my body is slow

They say I'm no good, but I've never been better
No, I've never been better

I don't ever wanna waste my time again
Don't you know how hard I try with you?
I don't ever wanna waste my time again
Don't you know how hard I try with you?

No, I can't tell apart a lie from the truth
The air gets thicker when you step into view
I don't know what you found but all my thoughts are new
But when I think of heaven I think of you

And they say that you are bad but I'll never do better
No, I'll never do better

I don't ever wanna waste my time again
Don't you know how hard I try with you?
I don't ever wanna waste my time again
Don't you know how hard I try with you?

And they say that you are bad but I'll never do better
No, I'll never do better

I don't ever wanna waste my time again
Don't you know how hard I try with you?
I don't ever wanna waste my time again
Don't you know how hard I try with you?

No, I don't ever wanna waste my time again
Don't you know how hard I try with you?
