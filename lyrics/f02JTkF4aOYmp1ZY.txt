Look at it
Like a golden loom
Weaving
A cloth that floats like silk
Hanging there in bloom
Name it what you will
Name it what you will

There is a silence in this room
It's making everyone uncomfortable
Hatched from a fold
Heavy and old
Rolled in the dent amidst us all
Chips like the stone off the surface
Sits like a dog on a fence
Eyes swept with rigor, more dissent
Marvelous innocence

Silence
Silence

The excess air is straining the walls
Spread-eagle thoughts plummet from trees like carnivores
Separations dome where even echoes travel alone
Dreams that are feeding off night
Like a flickering candlelight
Here I sit and watch its slow decline
Into

Silence
Silence
Silence
Silence

Ooooh silence
Silent words
Ooooh silence
Ooooh silence
Silent words
Oooooh

Ooooh silence
Silent words
Ooooh silence
Ooooh silence
Silent words
Ooooh silence
