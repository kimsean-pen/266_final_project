Just one touch
Just one touch, ah ah, yeah

You and I and nobody else
Feeling feelings I never felt
Boy, it's the way you got me under your spell
Don't you keep it all to yourself

So won't you take it
I feel like for the first time I am not faking
Fingers on my buttons and now you're playing
Master of anticipation, don't you keep it all to yourself

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet, all week
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh

Photograph with no T-shirt on
Why you making me wait so long?
I promise to keep this a secret, I'll never tell, yeah
But don't you keep it all to yourself, ooh

So won't you take it
I feel like for the first time I am not faking
Fingers on my buttons and now you're playing
Master of anticipation, don't you keep it all to yourself (to yourself)

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your love
Just a touch of your love
Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your love
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh

Just one touch of your love
Just one touch of your love (a touch of your love)
I wanna feel your touch
I want it, I want it, I want it so much
Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your love
Just a touch of your love
