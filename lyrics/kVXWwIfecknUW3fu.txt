Can't say that I knew
Away from feeling you
But can you see it too?
The way the skies are turning blue
Pastures on my mind
Running, searching just to find
A thing or two that once was true
The part of you that made me new
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream with me
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream with me
