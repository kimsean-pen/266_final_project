Hear the sound resonate
Through your flesh
Through hte ground, across the skies
Cracking roar, a thunder's bark
Echoes here, the voice of doom
Blackened clouds now seize the welking
Wielding all of winter's ire

And it will rise with a white voiceless face
From from the heart of earth
From under the mountain

The stromwind engulfs us
The whirl of white and grey
The downfall is upon us
The reprisal of wantom gods

Here at world's end we will termble
Far beyond the deceitful seas
Here we hide now, crawl to shelter
Far away from the homely shores

And it will rise with a white voiceless face
From the heart of the earth
From under the mountain
Devouring the sun and the earth, forest an sea
Devouring us all
