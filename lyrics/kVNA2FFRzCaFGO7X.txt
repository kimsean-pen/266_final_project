I'm all alone
I'm all alone, turn the lights low
(Go, go on and turn all these numbers out)
(Tap out)

I'm looking out (I've been trying to figure it out)
I'm looking out, for someone to see (Transmutable, pleasure)
And someone to be seeing me

But maybe
It's me
It's me I'm looking for
It's me
It's me on the dance floor
It's me
It's me I've been looking for (Transmutable)
It's me
It's me on the dance floor (This way)

I've been going out (This way)
I've been going out on a limb
(Go, go, into the shadow I see my face)
I begin to see who I might really be
Who I might really be
Who I might really be (Transmutable)
Who I might really be (Pleasure)

It's me
It's me I'm looking for
It's me
It's me on the dance floor (Yeah, yeah)
It's me
It's me I've been looking for (Transmutable)
It's me
It's me on the dance floor

(Transmutable)
I was looking for someone who might see me
And I might see too
Maybe that is you
Maybe
It's me
It's me I'm looking for
It's me
It's me on the dance floor
It's me
It's me I've been looking for
It's me
It's me on the dance floor

It's me
It's me I'm looking for
It's me
It's me on the dance floor
It's me
It's me I've been looking for
It's me
It's me on the dance floor
