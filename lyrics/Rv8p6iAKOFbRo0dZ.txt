I watch the days rush by me like a river
I shouldn't wait, but I'm scared to touch the water
I let the phone ring, why won't you believe me?
I wait for silence, takes a lot not to answer

All I have to say is
You don't deserve me
You don't deserve me
I'm finally walking away
'Cause you don't deserve me
And you're not worthy

And I won't let you pull me in
Because I know you're gonna win
But the war is over
And I won't fight you anymore
I never been so sure
'Cause the war is over

I used to let you paint a pretty picture
You got me caught up with your "You're my girl forever"
So I forgive you, it felt good when you'd hold me
Yeah, you owned me
Now you wish you had really known me

All I have to say is
You don't deserve me
You don't deserve me
I'm finally walking away
'Cause you'll only hurt me
And you're not worthy

And I won't let you pull me in
Because I know you're gonna win
But the war is over
And I won't fight you anymore
I never been so sure

This is not my surrender
I'm not running for cover
I'm right here, I know you see me
But your words no longer defeat me
In the night, when you're lonely
You remember how much you miss me
So you call, but I swear
You can try a million times
You'll get the same answer

All I have to say is
You don't deserve me
You don't deserve me
I'm finally walking away
'Cause you'll only hurt me
And you're not worthy

And I won't let you pull me in
Because I know you're gonna win
But the war is over

The war is over
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over
The war is over
