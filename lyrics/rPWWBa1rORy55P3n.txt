Picture this, promises yeah
You're a stitch, you'll tell them anything
Hear me out, don't be difficult
We'll work this out, and then mess it up again

Oh I've been slipping lately
I've been slipping lately

Call it quits, dwelling's criminal
Sorry miss, condition's critical
Soda fizz, is stuck in his bloodstream
Diagnosis, probably attention seeking

I've been slipping lately, oh I've been slipping lately
I've been slipping lately, oh I've been slipping lately

It doesn't really matter
You know what's real
Burning on your fingers
You know how to feel

I've been slipping lately, oh I've been slipping lately
I've been slipping lately, oh I've been slipping lately

Oh I've been slipping lately, oh I've been slipping lately
