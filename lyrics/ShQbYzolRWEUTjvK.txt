Sour Candy, endings...
Coffee stains, where oh I'm so tangled up in my
Big sunglasses and, bed hungry
Second day fair

No we went under
The weight was too much to carry in
I felt the thunder
Mr. Don't look so scared
I never knew, I never knew
That I could be so sad
We went under

I've been very cautious
Trying on this shed of pain
Your humor makes me, makes me nauseous
OU In a twisted, twisted, twisted game.

No we went under
The weight was too much to carry in
I felt the thunder
Mr. Don't Look So Scared
I never knew, I never knew
That I could be so sad we went under

Ohhhhh get your self home
You leave him alone
On second thought
I regret the things to let,
soo ohhh, oh ho...

Sour Candy... endings.
And I was barely even there.

No we went under,
The weight was too much to carry in
I felt the thunder,
Mr. Don't look so scared
I never knew I never knew
That I could be so sad... so sad... so sad. so sad.
So sad... We went under)
