Several women's magazines
Stacked up on top of a picture of me
When I tried to call no one answered

It's not even that I'm all angry
Just want to know why you would do this thing
You said there's an understanding

And I offered you a small dog in the kitchen
Just wanted you to feel at home

And that's why I am fine, I am fine, I am fine, I am fine
I just need one hundred dollars
I am fine, I am fine, I am fine, I am fine
I just need one hundred dollars
From you and you and you and you and you
