4 o'clock in the morning, city lights
Like diamonds lighting up the night
The party's over but we're not
Take a taxi down to the water
Moon is out, but it's getting hotter
It's been hours now, haven't had a drop
And this feeling won't stop

You're my champagne, baby you go straight to my head
Just one taste, I'm about as high as I can get
Voice shaking, heart skipping
One look and my world's spinning out
You're my champagne
You're my champagne

Long walk home cut through the park
Give away our secrets underneath the stars
Getting lost, but we laugh it off
Don't got cash, but we got time to spend
Don't stop, don't want this night to end
Wanna drink it up, every sip of you

You're my champagne, baby you go straight to my head
Just one taste, I'm about as high as I can get
Voice shaking, heart skipping
One look and my world's spinning out
You're my champagne
You're my champagne

Oh I'll never get enough of you

You're my champagne, baby you go straight to my head
Just one taste, I'm about as high as I can get
Voice shaking, heart skipping
One look and my world's spinning out
You're my champagne
You're my champagne
