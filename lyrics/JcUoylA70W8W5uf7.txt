I'm gonna let you in on a secret, I'm so afraid
Of letting my skeletons out, so I bottle them in
But I know it's gonna get out in the worst way, so I gave in
Now I'm gonna be an open book for you to read

The longer I stay numb, the longer I don't have to think much
I never have to think about my father and how he walked out on us
How I barely know my mother, for that I'm ashamed
Afraid of what they think of me, so I stay away

Let's make a pact right here, right now

You keep your hopes up that I can change
Well I stay honest, you do the same
I'll keep my purpose, you keep your faith
That we can get through this
These tougher days
These tougher days

I always felt that you won't understand
So I bled out quietly
The medicine held my hand
And made me feel like I can stand up
The toll it's taking on my chest now
Bridges burning and chances left out
List of things that I regret now
Build up this resentment

The longer I stay numb, the longer I don't have to think much
Never have to think about my father and how he walked out on us
How I barely know my mother, for that I'm ashamed
Afraid of what they think of me, so I stay away

You keep your hopes up that I can change
Well I stay honest, you do the same
I'll keep my purpose, you keep your faith
That we can get through this
These tougher days

Listen, let's make a pact right here, right now
Let's make a pact right here, right now

You keep your hopes up that I can change
Well I stay honest, you do the same
I'll keep my purpose, you keep your faith
That we can get through this
These tougher days
