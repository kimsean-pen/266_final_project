Wide awake while someone counts the minutes
Happiness, Missouri, I got to get your mind off
By the way, I told you we were in this
Happiness, Missouri, I got to get your mind off

Wide awake while someone counts the minutes
Happiness, Missouri, I got to get your mind off
By the way, I told you we were in this
Happiness, Missouri, I got to get your mind off

People are nice
They go easy on us, but
I'm on the Sun today

I murder each
Try to pinch my cheeks
Cause you're making me wanna stop

Wide awake while someone counts the minutes
Happiness, Missouri, I got to get your mind off
By the way, I told you we were in this
Happiness, Missouri, I got to get your mind off
