Let the rain fall down, let it fall to the ground
Let the rain fall down to the ground
And the birds don't sing, no, they don't make a sound
When you're six feet underground
Well, they cast me out when the word spread around
That I never sang in the church
And it took one night for the town to decide
I'm afflicted by the curse

And the rain falls down, let it fall to the ground
And the birds don't sing, no, they don't make a sound
So I look to the sky, tell me why, tell me why
Do they all get to live, and I have to die?

So they marched me down to the center of town
With their pitchforks high in the air
I was chained and bound with a blindfold around
So the judge wouldn't catch my stare
And they hung my soul from the gallows pole
But the witch they never found
So to those who don't fit society's mold
Learn to swim or you will drown

And the rain falls down, let it fall to the ground
And the birds don't sing, no, they don't make a sound
So I look to the sky, tell me why, tell me why
Do they all get to live, and I have to die?

And the angels sing, let it shine, let it shine
Dry the teardrops from my eyes
And the bells will ring when the blind lead the blind
'Cause the dead can't testify
And because I can't take an eye for an eye
In the afterlife I'll haunt you 'til you die

And the rain falls down, let it fall to the ground
Let teardrops hit the ground
And the birds don't sing, no, they don't make a sound
When you're six feet underground
So I look to the sky, tell me why, tell me why
Do they all get to live, and I have to die?

And the angels sing, let it shine, let it shine
Dry the teardrops from my eyes
And the bells will ring when the blind lead the blind
'Cause the dead can't testify
And because I can't take an eye for an eye
In the afterlife I'll haunt you 'til you die
And the angels sing, let it shine, let it shine
Dry the teardrops from my eyes
And the bells will ring when the blind lead the blind
'Cause the dead can't testify
And because I can't take an eye for an eye
In the afterlife I'll haunt you 'til you die
