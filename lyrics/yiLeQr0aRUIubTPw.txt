Speak up
My ears are growing weary
I'll sing this to the end
and watch the waves crash over me

Not too much to overcome with enough
time to turn it all around
In a picture perfect scenery I've become a
stick figure illustration

My eyes roll back and focus on what's
ahead
I can still stand if you lend the hand to
brace me

I'll take this on my own
