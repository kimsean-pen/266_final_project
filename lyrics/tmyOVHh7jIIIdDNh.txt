Total eclipse hides the Earth
The night of doom has come
Antichrist soldiers are proclaimed
To send souls to the Hell

Catastrophe, destruction
Mankind is slaughtered without mercy
Sulfur clouds are in the air
Legion winds corrode the universe

Messiah, redeemer of mankind
Chained in the valley of Hades
Crowds blinded by evil
Only death is real

The nuclear war announces the end of the world
The mankind is buried and forgotten
Prophets foresee the doom
They foresee the triumph of your death
