Getting bored
Fat and ignored and
You're nothing you're nothing
Don't want more shutting the door and you're nothing your nothing
F fuckin f - d - f - s'd and
You're nothing you're nothing
You're nothing you're nothing

Nothing seems to teach you ah yeah nothing seems to teach you
nothing seems to teach you ah yeah
nothing seems to teach you
nothing seems to teach you ah yeah
nothing seems to teach you
nothing seems to teach you ah yeah
nothing seems to teach you

Sometimes I go quiet staring at the sun

I'm unloved and outta luck and
You're nothing you're nothing
It's too much giving a fuck and
You're nothing you're nothing
Blah bla blah blah blah blah
You're nothing you're nothing
You're nothing you're nothing
Nothing seems to teach you, ah yeah nothing seems to teach you x4

Sometimes I go quiet staring at the sun x2

Bad times work out fine
Good times in my mind

Sometimes i go quiet staring at the sun

Nothing seems to teach you ih yea nthn seems to teach you x4
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah...
