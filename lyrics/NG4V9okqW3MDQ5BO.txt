You're gonna get it this time
You'll regret it this time
I'm gonna strike at the right time later
Now I've got the muscle
I've got time to tussle
I've got the time to teach a lesson,
You've been messin'

I've got something for you
Something special for you
No huggin' and kisses
This is business now

I'm all better just thinking about
When you come home I'm gonna lock you out
And you show up with that stupid grin
And I just let your love in

There won't be any warning
First thing in the morning
I'm gonna tell you see you later alligator
Instead of all my loving, you won't be getting nothing
That's tough, wake up and smell the muffin

You're looking out at a future that might never exist
I'm thinking of all the ways of getting over it
Well maybe I should be swimming from the sinking ship
'Cause I've been screaming and shouting
And so down about it till now

I'm all better just thinking about
When you wake up, I'm gonna punch you out
And you roll over with that stupid grin
And I just let your love in

I can't get away because I did it again
I'm not sticking with it 'cause of thick and thin
But all because of that stupid grin
I just let your love in

No I can't say no, no no no no
No no she can't say no no no no no
I just let your love in
No no she can't say no no no no no
I just let your love in
No no she can't say no no no no no

And I'm just
Looking out at a future that might never exist
I'm thinking of all the ways of getting over it
Well maybe I should be swimming from a sinking ship
'Cause I've been screaming and shouting
And so down about it till now

I'm all better just thinking about
When you come home I'm gonna kick you out
And you show up with that stupid grin
And I just let your love in

I can't get away because I did it again
I'm not sticking with it cause of thick and thin
But all because of that stupid grin
I just let your love in

No I can't say no, no no no no
I just let your love in
No, no, I can't say no, uh oh uh oh
I just let your love in
No, no I can't say no, uh oh uh oh
I just let your love in
No I can't say no, uh oh uh oh
I Just let your love in
