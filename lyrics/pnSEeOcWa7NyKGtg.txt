There are spirits coming to find me
They're not stopping until it's done
And I can feel them taking me over

Ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooh

I can see it from fifty-six miles away
But I can't hear what they're saying
They gotta believe me that I'll never forget you

Ooooh (Every day the ghosts are gonna fly)
Ooooh (Every way I know I'm going to try)
Ooooh (To keep you alive, to keep you alive)

So take me out into the night
It was all you didn't say, you had no fight
I was on the verge to scream
When you wouldn't scream about anything
I don't want to be your stupid fling or your magazine
That you look and turn the pages
Of someone else that you'll never love

(Every day the ghosts are gonna fly)
Ooooh
Ooooh

'Cause I was on the verge to scream
When you wouldn't scream about anything
