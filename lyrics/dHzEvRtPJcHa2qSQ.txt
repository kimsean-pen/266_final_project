The handshake
Seals the contract
From the contract
There's no turning back

The turning point of a career
In Korea
Being insincere

The holiday was fun packed
The contract
Still intact
The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
All for themselves
After all

The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
All for themselves
After all
It's a competitive world

Everything counts in large amounts

The graph on the wall
Tells the story of it all
Picture it now
See just how
The lies and deceit
Gained a little more power

Confidence
Taken in
By a sun tan and a grin

The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
All for themselves
After all

The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
All for themselves
After all
It's a competitive world

Everything counts in large amounts
Everything counts in large amounts

The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts

The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts

(Everything, everything)
(Everything, everything)

The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts

The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
Everything counts in large amounts
