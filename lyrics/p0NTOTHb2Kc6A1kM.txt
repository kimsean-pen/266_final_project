Please don't leave
Believe in me
I would not lie among the artifacts
Within the sacristy

I know they're sacred
I know we stand in hallowed halls
I would not speak with such conviction
If I did not fear for us all

But something happened
Something changed
Since we met yesterday evening
The symbols all have rearranged

This now reads "Fire"
That one says "Flame"
And my transcription might be off a bit,
But I think that one says "Pray"

Gather yourself
I need you calm and collected
I feel your dread. I know the fear.
But these thoughts are crippling you

Hold your head high like the minarets
We haven't been beaten yet
When the whole world starts to pirouette
Let me be your safety net

I know that you're scared of the local lore
But we've conquered worse before
The soothsayers can't always be correct
'bout what hasn't happened yet

Hold your head high like the palace walls
We're fearless. We stand up tall.
We won't be afraid of our fates at all
We'll be brave when judgment calls

If the ground opens up to swallow
The love that we've built
Will our world end in grief or elation
trepidation or guilt?

It's all for naught
The world's gone to pot
And no heaven's waitin' on me

But, when I'm down where it's warm
Would you still call me yours?
I think I'd still like to be
