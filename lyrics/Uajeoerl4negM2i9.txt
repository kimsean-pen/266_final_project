Did he disappear,
Did he really leave her here today
She's angry and in love
And needs to find a way to get to him
She's the one eyed lady
She pours herself a nice little glass of wine
And breed by sad hard magic
Or the weird tricks she will use to get to him

She runs into the forest
The trees are pushing her towards the hill
She lights them all on fire
So they cannot fly with her and tell to kill
She's the one I played him
She tricked him down
Led him to the water where she pushed him down,
Hold him down until he's dead
Would you kill for love,
kill for love,
kill for love?
Would you kill for love,
kill for love,
kill for love?
