Again we rise, to gain control
From the burnt out shell, of our ruined world

The reconstruction of civilization

This world - once ripped apart
Now as life - again shall start

Without thinking of our future generations
Our world descends to apocalyptic wars
Through desolate wastes of infernal devastation
Man shall rise to take control once more

From the wreckage of civilization
Through the ruins of this world
Man shall rise to power
And grow in strength once more
But will man seek to destroy
All that's been recreated
Have we learned through our suffering

Only time shall tell
Time shall tell
