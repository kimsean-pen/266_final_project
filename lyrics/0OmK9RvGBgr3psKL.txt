You raise me up
When I'm on the floor
You see me through
When I'm lonely and scared
And I'm feeling true to the written word
And you're true to me
And still I need more
It would tear me apart
To feel no one ever cared
For me
For me
For me
You are a tower of strength to me

You stand firm and proud
When the wind blows in your face
And when the sun shines in your eyes
You just turn your head away
To me
To me
To me
You are a tower of strength to me

You rescue me
You are my faith
My hope
My liberty
And when there is darkness all around
You shine bright for me
You are the guiding light

To me
To me
To me
You are a tower of strength to me

You are all passion and heart
When I lay in your embrace
And heaven is in your kiss
Salvation lies just a touch away

To me
To me
To me
You are a tower of strength to me
