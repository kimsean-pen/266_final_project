This condolence feeling
I'm back to this disease
And I'm along the walls
Feels safe till it breaks and rolls away

Cut me under
Underneath the sheets
And anesthesia is seeping into me
It's catching up, it's catching up
It's catching up

The simplicity nervous energy
How am I supposed to live
Stand tall and walk around
With weaklings trying not to burn to fall

Cut me under
Underneath the sheets
And anesthesia is seeping into me
It's catching up, it's catching up
It's catching up
And anesthesia is seeping into me
It's catching up, it's catching up
It's catching up, it's catching up

Cut me under
Underneath the sheets
And anesthesia is seeping into me
It's catching up, it's catching up
It's catching up
And anesthesia is seeping into me
It's catching up, it's catching up
It's catching up, it's catching up
