Walked a crooked road for a crooked mile
Showed my crooked teeth and my crooked smile
I read a cuckoo clock on a crooked wall
Turns out it's all crooked, y'all

And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Turns out that I'm crooked too

I read a crooked headline on a crooked page
There's a crooked leader on a crooked stage
But he seems to think he's standin' tall
Turns out it's all crooked, y'all

And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Turns out that I'm crooked too

So when you stand before that setting sun
And the needle's broken and the record's spun
You'll hear a stampede from a cattle call
Turns out it's all crooked, y'all
Oh, it turns out it's all crooked, y'all
