Frozen up north
Far from the sun
Where the heart of winter is one
Cold winds they blow
All frost and snow
Shadows creep in forests old
Unending realm awaiting fires end
All light from worlds disappear
I lurk the paths where grimly woods near
Frozen gates call me from there

Under these mountainsides rises no sun
Whereas the icy cold mountains are one
Beyond the wintery woods winds they call
Here under the might of its greatness I roar

Mighty
Ravendark
Mighty
Ravendark

Forests climb to mountains
Cold winds they blow
Thunder and twilight and snow
Frost, wind and fog, snow deep and cold
In the realm that is hidden from all
Mindless voices speak through the heart of the gods
From the wintery woods winds they call
Caught in the shadows of thy ravenrealm
The kingdom that blackened my soul

Under these mountainsides rises no sun
Whereas the icy cold mountains are one
Beyond the wintery woods winds they call
Here under the might of its greatness I roar

Throne of the north
Mountains of might
Blashyrkh by name
Blashyrkh by fire
Towers of ice
Shadows of gods
Tales of the one
Frozen kingdom

Kingdom of north
Throne of them all
Tales of the one
Mountaineous sons
Blashyrkh by fire
Blashyrkh by name
The throne of north
Mighty be thy law
Mighty Ravendark

Frozen up north

Frozen gates call me from there
