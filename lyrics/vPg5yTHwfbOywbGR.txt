Circle of hands, cold spirits' plan,
searching my land for an enemy.
Came across love's sweet cost
and in the face of beauty evil was lost.
Sky full of eyes. Minds full of lies.
Black from their cold hearts down to their graves.
Murder the dawn. Spreading their scorn.
Cursing the sun of which love was born.
We must keep them away or pretty soon we'll pay
and count the cost in sorrow.
Sacrifice, the future has its price
and today is only yesterday's tomorrow.
We must keep them away or pretty soon we'll pay
and count the cost in sorrow.
Sacrifice, the future has its price
and today is only yesterday's tomorrow - tomorrow.
Tomorrow Tomorrow
