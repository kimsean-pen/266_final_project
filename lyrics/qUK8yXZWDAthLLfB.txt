Oooo, oooo oohh
Two should combine,
Be true to your heart
You can believe in me
So take out your gun
The things that could do
We can build from the start
Will you trust in me

Money, no, I don't need no money, no
I mean, it's just money
It don't mean a thing
Without you

In the middle of the night
When the mood is right
And the moon is bright
We can give ourselves to the wild
Give it up to the wild

When we're working from this high
And you're by my side
Look in my eyes, we can start a whole new life
A whole new life

So take out your gun
The things that could do
We can build from the start
Will you trust in me

Money, no, I don't need no money, no
I mean, it's just money
It don't mean no thing
Without you

Money, no, I don't need no money, no
I mean, it's just money
It don't mean a thing
Without you

Tell me how you do it, do it
Would you, would you want some right now
Tell me how you do it, do it
Would you, would you want some right now
Tell me how you do it, do it
Would you, would you want some right now
Tell me how you do it, do it
Tell me how you do it, do it

Money, no, I don't need no money, no
I mean, it's just money
It don't mean no thing
Without you

Money, no, I don't need no money, no
I mean, it's just money
It don't mean a thing
Without you
