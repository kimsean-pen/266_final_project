I'm a worker baby, not telling lies
Heard you're holding on, got something in my eyes

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

Never call me lazy, cause I'm on time
Helps to turn me on when you cover up your prize

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

I need fire, baby, I need light
Always make it home but you hustle every night

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

Supposed to stay up late, supposed to say my name
You wanted out since the moment that I came

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

Haven't called me lately, and I don't fight it
Cause I'm not crazy, baby, I know when it isn't right

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

I'm a worker baby, not telling lies
Heard you're holding on, got something in my eyes

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
