The wind came down from mountain cold
And like a tide it roared and rolled
The branches groaned, the forest moaned
And leaves were laid upon the mould

The wind went on from West to east
All movement in the forest ceased
But shrill an harsh across the marsh
Its whistling voices were released

1. And runes of power upon the door.
There shone forever, fair and bright
