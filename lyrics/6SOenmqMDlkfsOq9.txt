Abandon me
Death in my veins
Look down on me
'Cause I feel the same

With nothing left to give I feel so empty
With the judgement raining down is only skin deep

I feel the pain
Inside my lungs
When you take away
The ones that I love
And I feel the pain
With so few to trust
When they fall away
And say, I'm not enough

They abandon me
'Cause I'm not like them
They hold me down
And tell me what I am

I feel the death inside this place around me
I know that you will live only near surround me

I feel the pain
Inside my lungs
When you take away
The ones that I love
And I feel the pain
With so few to trust
When they fall away
And say, I'm not enough

When I have nothing, you're always with me, with me
When I have nothing, I need you here, next to me
Next to me
