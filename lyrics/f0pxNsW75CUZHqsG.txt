'Cause you got my heart weighting down like a paperweight
Like a paperweight, like a paperweight

I sat inside that restaurant all by myself
I thought you'd come,
I couldn't hide behind my darkest shades
And all people walking by were starring at the lonely one
And wondering who made her cry that way

My heart is black and blue,
I don't want no one but you,
No one but you, oh
No one but you, oh
Kiss me like you do, oh
Kiss me like you do, oh

'Cause you got my heart weighting down like a paperweight
And I'm a fool I loved the one, the one that I should hate
You got my heart weighting down like a paperweight
Like a paperweight, like a paperweight

I really thought that your goodbye it's only just goodbye for now,
But you're not here, I guess the joke's on me
Try too hard to walk away but I can barely turn around,
This sidewalk feels like quicksand underneath my feet

My heart is black and blue,
I don't want no one but you,
No one but you, oh
No one but you, oh
Kiss me like you do, oh
Kiss me like you do, oh

'Cause you got my heart weighting down like a paperweight
And I'm a fool I loved the one, the one that I should hate
You got my heart weighting down like a paperweight
Like a paperweight, like a paperweight

Why can not let me let go
Why can not let me let go oh oh oh
Why can not let me let go
Why can not let me let go

'Cause you got my heart weighting down like a paperweight
And I'm a fool I loved the one, the one that I should hate
You got my heart weighting down like a paperweight
Like a paperweight, like a paperweight

'Cause you got my heart weighting down like a paperweight
And I'm a fool I loved the one, the one that I should hate
You got my heart weighting down like a paperweight
Like a paperweight, like a paperweight

No one but you, oh
No one but you, oh
Kiss me like you do oh
Kiss me like you do oh
