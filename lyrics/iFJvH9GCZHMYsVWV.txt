Everywhere i go
I see you there buried in my phone
I see you in the pictures that you post about your lifestyle
Tell me 'bout your lifestyle, is that real life though?

(Woah-oh) I, I, I, I
I miss you, what happened to all of my friends?
(Woah-oh) I, I, I, I
I miss you

Yo, ayy, ayy, ayy
I used to see you every weekend, me and you
We used to be friends, it's true,
these days we pretend that we're cool
But let's be fair, don't be fooled, I still think you rule
I just miss you dude fuck a picture
on the internet, yo, I need living proof
And heaven only knows if life is an interlude
Juliet and Romeo never got the time to pick and choose
Until it's adios I'll be here, yo, what's happening?
The only time you cameo is when I tag you in, ayy

Everywhere i go
I see you there buried in my phone
I see you in the pictures that you post about your lifestyle
Tell me 'bout your lifestyle, is that real life though?

(Woah-oh) I, I, I, I
I miss you, what happened to all of my friends?
(Woah-oh) I, I, I, I
I miss you, what happened to all of my friends?
What happened to all of my friends?
I miss you, what happened to all of my friends?
I miss you, what happened to all of my friends?

You're all about the follows and the shares
The comments and the likes, but you're super superficial
I don't comment out of sprite
Whatever happened to my life? Eat every dinner by myself
It's been a minute since we linked, yo, can we kick it IRL?
But you told me go to hell, so I feel like FML
I don't post so I'm a joke, yo, can I get an LOL?
You could have been my BFF, I guess we went a different route
I'm better off without my sociald, fuck a fear of missing out

Everywhere i go
I see you there buried in my phone
I see you in the pictures that you post about your lifestyle
Tell me 'bout your lifestyle, is that real life though?

(Woah-oh) I, I, I, I
I miss you, what happened to all of my friends?
(Woah-oh) I, I, I, I

What happened to all of my friends?
I miss you, what happened to all of my friends?

I, I, I, I

I, I, I, I
