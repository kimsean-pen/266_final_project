How could you know, how could you know
That those were my eyes
'Peepin through the floor, it's like they know
It's like they know I'm looking from the outside
And creeping to the door, it's like they know
And now they coming, yeah, now they coming
Out from the shadows
To take me to the club because they know
That I shut this down
'Cause they been watching all my windows
They gathered up the warrant 'cause they

You understand, I got a plan for us
I bet you didn't know that I was dangerous
It must be fate, I found a place for us
I bet you didn't know someone could love you this much

How could they know, how could they know
What I been thinking?
But they're right inside my head because they know
Because they know, what I've been hiding
They're right under my bed, they're on patrol
Here they come, yeah here they come
Outta the shadows
To take me to the club because they know
That I shut this down
'Cause they been watching all my windows
They gathered up the warrant 'cause they

And I've gotta get outta here
Sink down, into the dark
(Keep on running) And I've gotta get outta here
(Keep on running) Sink down, into the dark

You understand, I got a plan for us
I bet you didn't know that I was dangerous
It must be fate, I found a place for us
I bet you didn't know someone could love you this much

Nobody's listening when we're alone
Nobody's listening, there's nobody listening
No one can hear us when we're alone
No one can hear us, no, no one can hear us

And I've gotta get outta here
Sink down, into the dark
(Keep on running) And I've gotta get outta here
(Keep on running) Sink down, into the dark

You understand, I got a plan for us
I bet you didn't know that I was dangerous
It must be fate, I found a place for us
I bet you didn't know someone could love you this much
