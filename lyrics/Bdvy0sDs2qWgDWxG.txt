Farmer Steph Williams was cool as a band
He ran the neighbourhood, was the man in demand
Farmer Steph Williams got too hot on the block
They ran him outta town then the whole operation stopped

Everybody saying, "What about us?" Yeah

You can call it what you want
But the young blood's taking over
Don't get too comfortable, just plan on moving over
'Cause things gon' stay the same
It's the same thing over and over

What about us?
Everybody saying, "What about us?" Yeah
