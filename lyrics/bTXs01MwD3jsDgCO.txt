i took my shirt off in the yard
no one saw that the skin on my shoulders was golden
now it's not
my shirt's back on
i forgot my songs
the glow is gone
my gliding body stopped

i could not get through september without a battle
i faced death
i went in with my arms swinging

but i heard my own breath
and i have to face that i'm still living
i'm still flesh
i hold on to awful feelings
i'm not dead
there's no end
my face is red

my blood
flows harshly

my heart
beats loudly

my chest still draws breath
i hold it
i'm buoyant

there's no end
