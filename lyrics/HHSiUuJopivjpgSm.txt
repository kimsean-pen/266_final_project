She meticulously curls her hair, her hair, her hair
Her long blond hair
Applies mascara with the greatest care
With care, with care, the utmost care
She puts on lipstick that is scarlet red
She's already fairly off her head
Fishnet stockings and a bottle of wine
She's fine, she's fine, she thinks she's fine

Girls, you better watch out, schizophrenic playboys
Who cannot control their toys, la-la-la-la
Girls, you better watch out (ah-ah-ah)
Schizophrenic playboys (ah-ah-ah)
Who cannot control their toys (ah ah ah), la-la-la-la

(Out, out, out, out, out, out)

Baby, baby, will you come with me, with me, with me, please, come with me
I'll take you places that you'd rather be, to be, to be, to come with me
Driving faster now in his car, now she knows that she has gone too far
In the morning she is in his bed, his bed, his bed
Her eyes are red

Girls, you better watch out, schizophrenic playboys
Who cannot control their toys, la-la-la-la
Girls, you better watch out (ah-ah-ah)
Schizophrenic playboys (ah-ah-ah)
Who cannot control their toys (ah-ah-ah), la-la-la-la

(Out, out, out)
(Out) I'm in, (out) I'm out, (out) I'm out
(Out) I'm in, (out) I'm out, (out) I'm out

Boys, you better watch out (ah-ah-ah)
Schizophrenic playgirls (ah-ah-ah)
They cannot control their curls (ah-ah-ah), la-la-la-la
Girls, you better watch out (ah-ah-ah)
Schizophrenic playboys (ah-ah-ah)
Who cannot control their toys (ah-ah-ah), la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
