You walked in the room, I knew you were different
Just like a balloon you had me up in the ceiling

That's when you looked at me and I looked at you
And everything else just froze
As you hug your friend, you're staring my way
Cuz when I look at you and you look at me
The universe explodes
You can read it in my eyes

Maybe I don't mind, mind to fall in love, mind to fall in love with you
And maybe I got time, time to run away, time to run away with you but first
Let's get loose tonight, loose tonight
Do you wanna get loose tonight, loose tonight?

A riddle I told to see if she's following
"That shade of Dior on you will look better after some biting"

That's when you looked at me and I looked at you
And everything else just froze
As you tell your friend to get out of your way
Cuz when I'm touching you and you're touching me
The universe explodes
I can read it in your eyes

Maybe I don't mind, mind to fall in love, mind to fall in love with you
And maybe I got time, time to run away, time to run away with you but first
Let's get loose tonight, loose tonight
Do you wanna get loose tonight, loose tonight?
Let's get loose tonight, loose tonight
Do you wanna get loose tonight, loose tonight?

All the girls in here are fine
But you are something else
Wanna have you all to myself
All the girls in here are fly
But you are something new
Got the force to shoot me through the roof

All the girls in here are fine
But you are something else
Wanna have you all to myself
All the girls in here are fly
But you are something new
Got the force to shoot me through the roof

All the girls in here are fine
But you are something else
Wanna have you all to myself
All the girls in here are fly
But you are something new
Got the force to shoot me through the roof

Loose tonight
