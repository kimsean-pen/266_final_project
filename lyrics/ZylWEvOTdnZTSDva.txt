What's driving me,
Is driving you.
Born from the same Race,
From the same blue.
You try to resist,
You try to resist,
But i tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you
You're gonna stay.

Trash it, trash it,
It's just a rental.
Trash it, trash it,
It's just a rental.
.Trash it, trash it,
Don't be gentle.
Trash it, trash it,
It's just a rental.

What is you're name?
We want to know.
If you play our game,
You have to show.
So i says. Pull down all defences,
Pull down all defenses,
We'll take 'em, take 'em, take 'em, take 'em, take 'em
With our offences.

Trash it, trash it,
It's just a rental.
Trash it, trash it,
It's just a rental.
Trash it, trash it,
Don't be gentle.
Trash it, trash it,
It's just a rental.

Pull down all defences,
Pull down all defenses,
Pull down all defences,
Pull down all defenses,

Golden rental
Trash it, trash it,
A golden rental
Golden rental
Trash it, trash it,
A golden rental
