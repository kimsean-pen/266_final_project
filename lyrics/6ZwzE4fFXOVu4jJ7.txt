With all your whispering in my ear
You'd think I could tell when you are near
Now all that's rapping at my door
Are ghosts and memories anymore

With all your whispering in my ear
You'd think I could tell when you are near
Now all that's rapping at my door
Are ghosts and memories anymore

Be here now, don't you run away
Be here now, don't you run away
Be here now, don't you run away

Be here now, don't you run away
All your garments in disarray
Be here now, don't you run away
Be here now, don't you run away
Be here now, don't you run away
Be here now, don't you run away
Be here now, don't you run away
