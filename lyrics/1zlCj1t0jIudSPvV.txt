Here we are, face to face
We forget, time and place
Hold me now, don't let go
Though it hurts and we both know

The time we spend together's gonna fly
And everything you do to me is gonna feel so right
Baby when you're loving me I feel like I could cry
'Cause there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you, no, no, no, no, no

Here we are all alone
Trembling hearts, beating strong
Reaching out, breathless kiss
I never thought could feel like this

I want to stop the time from passing by
I wanna close my eye sand feel your lips are touching mine
Baby when you're close to me I want you more each time
And there's nothing I can do, to keep from loving you

There's nothing I can do I'm helpless in your arms
Oh baby what you do I'm in love, this is it
There's no turning back this time no no no

Here we are once again
But this time we're only friends
Funny world sometimes lies
Become the game, when loves the prize

And though no one knows what's going on inside
And all the love I feel for you is something I should hide
When I have you close to me the feelings so sublime
But there's nothing I can do to keep from loving you no no no
Can't keep from loving you baby no no no
There's nothing I can do my baby can't keep from loving you
