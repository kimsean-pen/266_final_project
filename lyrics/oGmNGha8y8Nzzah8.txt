It's gonna be alright
It's just to change your mind
Don't forget about the good times
It's gonna be alright
It just takes some time
To forget about her one line

Darling, I know, sometimes it's hard to take
Believe me, I know, you're gonna make it through the day
Darling, I know, sometimes it's hard to take
Believe me, I know, you're gonna make it through the day

It's alright, sleep tight
It's just to change your mind
I'm sure she meant what she said that night
You gotta let her go, don't fight
It's just to change your mind
You'll feel better in your own time

Darling, I know, sometimes it's hard to take
Believe me, I know, you're gonna make it through the day
Darling, I know, sometimes it's hard to take
Believe me, I know, you're gonna make it through the day

I know it hurts, I know it hurts moving on
I know it hurts, hurts moving on, hurts moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving on, moving on, moving on
