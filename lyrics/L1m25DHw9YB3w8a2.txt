Known ya since we were younger
And even now that we're older
You're still a kid so curious
Who's peeking over my shoulder.
You always drift around.
You never let me down.
I trust that you'll be yourself.
Don't act like you're no one else.
You can be a space case.
You do it your own way.
There's a strange sincerity
That makes them girls go crazy.
Maybe it don't make sense.
You don't have to understand.

James! Doesn't try still attracts the babes!
All the guys say he's got no game!
You can laugh but in the end now
Everybody's on a date with my buddy James.
And everybody knows his name.
He's driving everybody insane!
They wanna be like James.

You're talking to a lady.
It's awkward entertainment.
Freeze up like a popsicle
Then melting on the pavement.
It's not the clothes you wear.
You don't have to dye that hair.
No need to go all new.
You should just stick with you.
Always been the nice guy
Living on the side lines.
You're afraid to take a chance
So step into the lime light.
People like underdogs.
Someone worth fighting for.

James! Doesn't try still attracts the babes!
All the guys say he's got no game!
You can laugh but in the end now
Everybody's on a date with my buddy James.
And everybody knows his name.
He's driving everybody insane!
They wanna be like James.

When you walk into a room,
Makin everybody swoon.
So invincible.
The writings on the wall.(yea)

James! Doesn't try still attracts the babes!
All the guys say he's got no game!
You can laugh but in the end now
Everybody's on a date with my buddy James.

James! Doesn't try still attracts the babes!
All the guys say he's got no game!
You can laugh but in the end now
Everybody's on a date with my buddy James.
And everybody knows his name. (Ladies)
He's driving everybody insane!
They wanna be like James.

(That's my friend James)
