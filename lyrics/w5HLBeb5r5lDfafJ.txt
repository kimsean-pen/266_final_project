I WANNA TASTE YOUR SKIN AND GO FAST
IMITATION OR REPLAY
EVERY CALL YOU NEVER MADE
IT SOUNDS LIKE A SCAM
HOW COULD YOU LOVE?
AND WHEN YOU FEEL THE BREEZE
(oh oh oh oooh,)YOU'LL NEED SO MANY DIFFERENT GRASPS
TO SAVE YOU
I GAVE YOU ALL MY HOPE, TO GO FAR
ADORATION OR DELETE
THROUGH THE MOON YOU TOUCHED THE END
NOW YOU CAN SEE, YOUR HISTORY
AND WHEN YOU FEEL THE BREEZE
(oh oh oh oooh,)YOU'LL NEED SO MANY DIFFERENT GRASPS
TO SAVE YOU
• DON'T CRY FOR ANYTHING I PRAY(you will exist)
• DON'T LIE FOR ANYTHING I SAY (the light was gray)
• HOW DOES IT FEEL TO SURVEVE (get up again)
• I'M STILL WAITING FOR YOUR SMILE (goodbye)
