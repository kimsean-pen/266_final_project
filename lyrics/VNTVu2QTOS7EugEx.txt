Buried underneath a stack of papers on my desk
There's a document and a signed $10 check
Precautionary measures in case I change my mind
On the drive over with the stereo turned off
I sunk into a pit filled with catastrophic thoughts
My trusty lack of confidence, you're keeping me alive

Maybe this is just another good thing
That happens to everybody but me
Maybe this is just another good thing out of my reach
You're so out of my reach

Behind the guest room door
I felt weird and we had sex
Gathered up our clothes
We shook hands and then I left
Feels like it's been forever
But that was Friday night

Maybe this is just another good thing
That happens to everybody but me
Maybe this is just another good thing out of my reach
You're so out of my reach

Covered in fake blood, I got bad news from a friend
It didn't work this time but we could try again

Maybe this is just another good thing
That happens to everybody but me
Maybe this is just another good thing out of my reach
You're so out of my reach

Maybe this is just another good thing
That happens to everybody but me
Maybe this is just another good thing out of my reach
You're so out of my reach
