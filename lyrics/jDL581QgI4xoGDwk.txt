Her venom makes me strong
Stronger than I am on my own
Before too long I'll wake up to it gone
Wondering how I ever was happy

Hot venom is mixin' with my blood
I can feel it on my fingers and taste it on her tongue
It feels so good to fall in love with you

Her power turns me on
Turns me up on high and lets me burn
You can't go back now, that's not how this works
And as long as she's gone I can never be happy

Hot venom is mixin' with my blood
I can feel it on my fingers and taste it on her tongue
It feels so good to fall in love with you

Hot venom is mixin' with my blood
I can feel it on my fingers and taste it on her tongue
It feels so good to fall in love with you
