Into ashes, dust to dust
Carrying it out without prayer
I lay down the remains of us
Bury them up with my despair

Screams gone silent
This is the end
Bringing me release
It's the funeral
Of our love
And I set you free

Oh, I am giving up your ghost
Forgiving what can be forgotten
Oh, I am giving up your ghost
So I no more have to live haunted
Go now in peace little restless soul
Of all of the things I've loved you the most
But I'm giving up your ghost

I turned the page and burned the book
Laid this dream six feet under
And every breath that aches for you
No more can kill my thunder

Screams gone silent
This is the end
Bringing me release
It's the funeral
Of our love
And I set you free
Oh, I am giving up your ghost
Forgiving what can be forgotten
Oh, I am giving up your ghost
So I no more have to live haunted
Go now in peace little restless soul
Of all of the things I've loved you the most
But I'm giving up your ghost
