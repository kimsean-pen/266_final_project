Epitaph above your head
For many years you've been dead
Maggot brain - Pus filled eyes
In a moldy casker you reside

Your the dead, your heart is black
Lived your life in blasphemy
Now you rot day by day
Eternal torture, slow decay

Your body's filled with rotten worms
Skin falls off your bones
The moon ignites your dried up corpse
How decrepit you have grown

Your reek of shit and rotten guts
Embalming fluids - Rancid crud
Released from hell you walk the earth
Your rotten corpse give new birth
