It feels just like it was yesterday
We were in love, why's it falling apart?
I've never been one to walk away
But I've had enough & it's breaking my heart

'Cause you love me just the way that you should
It's nothing that you do, no, it's nothing you say

Yeah baby, I know that you're good
But I don't want a good girl, no, not today

'Cause I want it bad
I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah
I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want it bad

I want a girl who stays out too late
And when I call she doesn't answer the phone
Oh, I want a girl who likes it her way
And through it all I know I'll end up alone

Yeah, yeah, you love me just the way that you should
It's nothing that you do, no, no, it's nothing you say
Oh pretty baby, I know that you're good
But I don't want a good girl, no, not today

'Cause I want it bad
I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah
I wanna fight
I wanna rock & roll & party all night
Yeah, I want it bad
I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want it bad

I'm getting sick of predictable
Tired, vapid, logical
Oh yeah, I gotta shake it up tonight
Yeah girl, I want something physical
Not something invicible
Oh yeah, I'm tired of being good, let's be bad

I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah
I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah
I wanna fight
I wanna rock & roll & party all night
Yeah, I want it bad
I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah
I wanna fight
I wanna rock & roll & party all night
Yeah, I want it bad
