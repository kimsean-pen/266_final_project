It's back to school, order of the day
First things first, you need to know the truth
Don't trust anybody, including you
What counts is words in your history book
Take a look, pick the lock, by hook or by crook
Put your values aside it's my advice
Eye for an eye if you try to diss
What?! What?!

Can I get the (cold truth) understand the story
Time to give the (cold truth) the end will be bloody

"It's like this and like that and like this and uh"
Since I was a kid I've really had enough
You can ask a question
But choose it carefully
Strange conception of the right to liberty
I did my best but never agreed
With you, with her and all these creeds
Sanction after sanction I moved away
'till I found myself standing with my own key
What?! What?!

Can I get the (cold truth) understand the story
Time to give the (cold truth) the end will be bloody

Shut up and learn
Learn the way we've chosen for you
The time, the space, we control all you need
A global vision by a global crew
Manipulation starts with what you read
Read them all
Read them all
Read them'... and kill 'em all

Can I get the (cold truth) understand the story
Time to give the (cold truth) the end will be bloody
