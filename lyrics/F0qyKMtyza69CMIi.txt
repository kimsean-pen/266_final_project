So many times I can hear you by my side
But you seem so far away
In my mind, in my heart
If I could only find the words to say
Little voices whispering choices
Telling me where I went wrong
I can see easily
Come on baby come on come on

Find a better way to communicate
Stay a little while
Stop and listen to me
Anything you want I will do for you
Words are meaningless
When I lose myself in you
(When I lose myself)
When I lose myself in you
(When I lose myself)
When I lose myself in you

I'd rather leave the past behind
Don't wanna talk about it no more
Put it down to history
What we did we said before
When I gaze into your eyes
Will I see my future there?
Shining bright harbour light
Come on baby I'll take you there

Find a better way to communicate
Stay a little while
Stop and listen to me
Anything you want I will do for you
Words are meaningless
When I lose myself in you
(When I lose myself)
When I lose myself in you
(When I lose myself)
When I lose myself in you

When I lose myself in you...

Find a better way to communicate
Stay a little while
Stop and listen to me
Anything you want I will do for you
Words are meaningless
When I lose myself in you

Find a better way to communicate
Stay a little while
Stop and listen to me
Anything you want I will do for you
Words are meaningless
When I lose myself in you
