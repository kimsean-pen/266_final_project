Too late, too late to tell you
I'm gonna build a world around you
Too far, too far away for me to pull you in
And show you just what I
Can do with a lover who tries
To bend with me too

What's chasing you?
Ooh-ooh-ooh oooh
What's chasing you?
Ooh-ooh-ooh oooh

I don't understand a single word that you say
Baby are you talking to me?
Words that twist around a wire again
Make you send through all your secrets to your heart

Oh-oh-ooh why
Do we do what we do when we lie?
We give shape to the struggle

What's chasing you?
Ooh-ooh-ooh oooh
What's chasing you?
Ooh-ooh-ooh oooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh oooh

Too late, too late to tell you
I'm gonna build a world around you
Too far, you're too far away for me to pull you in
And show you just what I
I can do with a lover who tries
To bend with me too
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

What's chasing you?
Ooh-ooh-ooh oooh
What's chasing you?
Ooh-ooh-ooh oooh
What's chasing you?
Ooh-ooh-ooh oooh
Ooooh.
Oooh-ooh-ooh oooh
