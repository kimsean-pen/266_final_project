When it all gets done?
Thinking who I'll be?
What have I become?
If I strike the match?
And I'd let it burn?
Will I still feel numb?
'Cause I've tried my best
Just to work it out,
But I still feel dumb?
What have I become?
What have I become?
What have I become?

And you wanna say
You love me,
But you're not here no more
And I've got to let it
'Cause I know I'm not welcome here no more

Will it all falls through
When you've walked the way?
What am I to do?
If I close my eyes and you sung the door
Will I think of you?
'Cause I've tried my best
Just to work it out,
But I'm black and blue?
What have I become?
What have I become?
What have I become?

And you wanna say
You love me,
But you're not here no more
And I've got to let it
'Cause I know I'm not welcome here no more

Love, I've be lying
The only fire is in my heart again
Love, I've be lying
The only fire is in my heart again
Love, I've be lying
The only fire

And you wanna say
You love me,
But you're not here no more
And I've got to let it
'Cause I know I'm not welcome here no more
