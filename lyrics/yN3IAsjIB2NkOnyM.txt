oh Johnny was a dark child
He was promised to us all
But rides in the night
Can lift you out of sight
When they call, that's all

My, Sally was a princess
And she was chosen for the crown
But chains can't stop the sound

Of one night in the city
One night looking pretty

The someone opened doorways
And Johnny slipped away
Running for the bright
Where dark is always light
But there's no day, no way

The princess saw the dark child
And the dark child said her name
Come steal away, we'll play the game

Do you watch? Do you see?
Do you know the people in me?
I'm the bite, I'm the bark, I'm the scream
I'm the poor, I'm the sure
I'm the holy, I'm the pure
I can tell you tales you just might not believe

One night in the city
One night looking pretty
One night in the city
One night looking pretty

One night...

Yeah, the children shared the wonder
Of the leather and the lace
But one child went away
And one child stayed to play

For one night in the city
One night looking pretty
One night in the city
One night touching pretty

But chains don't make a wall
And dreams lay where they fall
Dark is never night
When dreams make up the light

One night in the city
One night feeling pretty
One night in the city
Feeling pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty in the city

One night in the city
One night, one night
One night, one night
One night in the city
One night, one night
Oh one child went away
And one child stayed to play
But chains don't make a wall
Your dreams are lay just where they fall
In the city
One night in the city
One night in the city
