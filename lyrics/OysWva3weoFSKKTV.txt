You're the fighter you've got the fire
The spirit of a warrior, the champion's heart
You fight for your life because the fighter never quits
You make the most of the hand you're dealt
Because the quitter never wins

They tell the story of a throwback
With the heart of a lion
They salute your glory

It's another murderous night
Another left from hell
A bloody war on the boardwalk
And the kid from Lowell rises to the bell

Micky
It's a warrior's code
