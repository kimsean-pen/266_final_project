Love
I'm already ten steps ahead
Took the wrong train and I fell
Head over heels in a moment
Then you're gone

Blank stare
If you're bored, you're boring
Unaware
Could I get a warning?

Love
I can see rain coming in
Like jellyfish limbs from a distance
Tired commuter heads sway and bow
Praying to you

Blank stare
If you're bored, you're boring
Unaware
You could cure the lonely
