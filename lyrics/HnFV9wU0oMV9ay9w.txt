Somewhere down the way, there's a hidden place that anyone
That all of us could find
But our maps have failed, so venture through the veil and realize
That these roads are intertwined

Far beyond those walls, gleaming black and white
Further than our false schemes of wrong and right
Is a field where we can walk
Leaving all our names behind

I will meet you there, beyond the pines
Templed in twilight or dawn
The light and easy air
Tracing the lines on our palms

Somewhere down the road is a place that we can go where everyone
And everything is divine
And when we're all awake, we can finally make and end of these
Divisions in our minds

Far beyond those walls, gleaming black and white
Further than our false schemes of wrong and right
Is a field where we can walk
Leaving all our names behind

I will meet you there, beyond the pines
Templed in twilight or dawn
The light and easy air
Tracing the lines on our palms

I will meet you there, beyond the pines
Templed in twilight or dawn
The light and easy air
Tracing the lines on our palms

And I will meet you there
(Don't go to sleep)
Our souls and feet both bare
(With grass beneath)
The oaths we needn't swear
(Are vast and deep)
Our breath will be our prayer
(Alone, complete)

I will meet you there, beyond the pines
Templed in twilight or dawn
The light and easy air
Tracing the lines on our palms

I will meet you there, beyond the pines
Templed in twilight or dawn
The light and easy air
Tracing the lines on our palms
I will meet you there
