Spin away the combination for the last time
Say goodbye to this year
I wish I could avoid the empty
Summer days that await me
They'll fake a smile goodbye
Celebrating their new freedom
I'll sit alone on the couch
Wondering why

I wonder what it's like to have it all
To never be afraid that I would fall
But I don't think I've ever known a time
That I was part of the in crowd

Here we go another, day another disgrace
Fall flat on my face
I wish I had a bunch of money
Catch a plane, head out west
They'll run and play around
All full of their phantom freedom
I'll sit alone on the couch
Wondering why

I wonder what it's like to have it all
To never be afraid that I would fall
But I don't think I've ever known a time
That I was part of the in crowd

Doesn't anyone here live an original life?
What did you surrender to be on the inside?
When you disappear they won't remember your name
And you'll fade away and someone takes your place
Takes your place
In the in crowd

Spin away the combination for the last time
Say goodbye to this year
I wish I could avoid the empty
Summer days that await me
They'll fake a smile goodbye
Celebrating their new freedom
I'll sit alone on the couch

But I'm ready to fly

I wonder what its like to have it all
To never be afraid that I would fall
But I don't think I've ever known a time
I wonder what its like to have it all
To never be afraid that I would fall
But I don't think I've ever known a time
That I was part of the in crowd
Of the in crowd
Of the in crowd

I don't need anything that I can't find in me
All my life I have been on a line at the end
Waiting for something more, something new to begin
Waiting for something more, some way to fit in
In the in crowd
In the in crowd
