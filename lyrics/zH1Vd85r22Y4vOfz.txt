I lost my mind, my heart's been stolen
But don't ask why, 'cause I'll never know it
The deep end arrives, it's all frozen
It's all frozen, it's all frozen

And I'm just trying, I'm tryna warn ya
I don't know why, why I adore ya
And I could die, in this moment
But I'm still holding, but I'm still holding

I'm holding on, I'm holding on for love
I'm just holding on, I'm holding on for love, whoa
I'm just holding on, I'm holding on for love
I'm just holding on, I'm holding on for love, whoa

Could've lost my life, I'm just foreign
I found my wife, but she doesn't know yet
And deep in her eyes, it's still frozen
It's still frozen, it's still frozen

And I'm just trying, I'm tryna warn ya
I don't know why, why I adore ya
And I could die, in this moment
But I'm still holding, but I'm still holding

I'm holding on, I'm holding on for love
I'm just holding on, I'm holding on for love, whoa
I'm just holding on, I'm holding on for love
I'm just holding on, I'm holding on for love, whoa
