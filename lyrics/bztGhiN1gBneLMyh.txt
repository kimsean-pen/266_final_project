Buildings in clouds here
Our time and our place dear
Theres life in us yet love
These walls we will climb above

We really are ants now
Escape the nest somehow
I ache for a feeling
You came and you poured it in, it in

Buildings in clouds here
Our time and our place dear
There's life in us yet love
These walls we will climb above, above

Look up
Through the trees to feel as small as you can
You hear the clocks counting down
The nights are longer now than ever before
But now you see the lights from the town

I'm drained and I'm empty
I've still got love in me
There's eyes in the sky tonight
Watching us lose the fight

We really are ants now
Escape the nest somehow
I ache for a feeling
You came and you poured it in, it in

Look up
Through the trees to feel as small as you can
You hear the clocks counting down
The nights are longer now than ever before
But now you see the lights from the town

Look up
Through the trees to feel as small as you can
You hear the clocks counting down
The nights are longer now than ever before
But now you see the lights of the town
