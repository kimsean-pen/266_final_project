A bridge splits November's sky
I'm in two halves inside
This is the past right here
I choose to leave it here

The cliffs loom to scrape you thin
The bowl churns to overspill
But I can see us here
Without this fear

I want to find those books
Search your face, torment us
You're just a shower to someone dry
A shower to the wilted and the dried

Because we all leave courage's side
But I'll always be courage's child
The past I'll clear
I choose to leave it here (Leave it here)

You say have your time again
But you can't and the warning starts now
What's in the frame it makes you sad
But you can't fill the gaps

We're four rings on a chain
So don't make them rust
I'll be your maps, I'll be your eyes
I'll give the ending a nudge

I don't want to see you like this
I don't want to see you like this
I don't want to see you like this
I don't want to see you like this

Alive now in the middle, not looking from outside
Wishing that it was a screen fight
Settled with all of a heroes flair
Put aside, find a new character

I don't want to, don't want to
Don't want to see you like this
I don't want to see you like this
I don't want to see you like this

A bridge splits November's sky
I'm in two halves inside
This is the past right here
I choose to leave it here
