Like a sun rising
Like a sun rising
Lifting out of the haze

Coming home by the long road
I could tell from a mile out
Yeah could tell from a mile out
Just the look on your face

All the keys to the kingdom yeah
And the moon in its phases
Yeah the moon in its phases
May we dance and erase

Whatever else
Whatever else now

With an eye to the keyhole
While a shout in the distance
Yeah a shout in the distance
Takes me back to the start

That was deaf to the warnings
Won't take no for an answer
Won't take no for an answer
This ridiculous heart

Won't take no for an answer
Wants you all to its own self
Needs you all to its own self
This unquenchable heart

What was there in the first place
Like a sun rising
Like a sun rising
Lifting out of the haze

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Whatever else
Whatever else now

What was there in the first place
Like a sun rising
What was there in the first place
Like a sun rising
What was there in the first place
Like a sun rising
Like a sun rising
Like a sun
