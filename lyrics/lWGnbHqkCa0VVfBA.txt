Wake up to a world overcast in concrete skies
Where the smell of exhaust is a factor in people's daily lives
You elevate to earn yourself the status
Then walk home alone at the end of the day in single file

Hard to come to terms with how they do it
When the streets are lined with houses you can't live in

Meagre sleep to spend time in tall buildings
In front of scrolling numbers on computer screens
All her friends stay logged into the system
In fear of what would go down if they tried to hide

Hard to come to terms with how they do it
When the air is formed of things that you can't breathe in
Scan the streets in search of something better
I've been here since I can remember

Hard to come to terms with all the consequence at stake
To stay there
She'd lie awake for hours dreaming up a better place
Where maybe...

Hard to come to terms with all the effort that it takes
To stay here
She'd lie awake for hours thinking of another way.

My Lady
You're gone
It's done

My mind is racing but I can't feel my head.
This world an island,
isolated conscience buried in the sand. Sleeping.

The blurry memories they come as they go
So hard to focus when the city watches everything you do
And stops you
From dreaming
I'm leaving
Soon.
