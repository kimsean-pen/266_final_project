this is forgiven
if the uniform fits
postponed, at the first showing
this is the tension mold
of frozen icicles
and it feels like it's snowing
you speak in tongues
tremors that warn us of ourselves

(walk away)
born in hearts
etched in cold
at the first showing
(walk away)
born in hearts
etched in cold

nothing bleeds the same
my travel expenses paid
postponed, at the first showing
this dance is out of rhythm
we trip on excess steps
postponed, at the first showing
you speak in tongues
tremors that warn us of ourselves

(walk away)
born in hearts
etched in cold
at the first showing
(walk away)
born in hearts
etched in cold

born in hearts
yet etched in cold
swingsets pay
the playground toll

tremors that hold us
tremors that warn us
nothing bleeds like

(walk away)
born in hearts
etched in cold
at the first showing
(walk away)
born in hearts
etched in cold
