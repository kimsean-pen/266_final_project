Do you know tomorrow is made of lies?
Take a sip of truth
Before they read your rights
Tonight

Think you've got the answers
They made'em up made you clean
Enough for the neo-Christ
Isn't that nice

They talker about the dieties
And the sacrificial obscurities
For the sake of life

Do you find the rationale divine?
Make a pentagram for the god of light

You know everybody dies alone
You know everybody dies alone
You know that they're using mind control
You know everybody dies alone

Lead a life luxurious
Then they took it all
Make a new living as a succubus
Void of Lust

They'll tell you what pleasure is
If your leisure time's spent drinking wine
Being such a lush
There's no rush

Aliens form pickett lines
For their wicked shrines
Cast in plastic beneath a retail sign

Do you find the rationale divine?
Burn it to the ground for the god of light

You know everybody dies alone
You know everybody dies alone
You know that they're using mind control
You know everybody dies alone
