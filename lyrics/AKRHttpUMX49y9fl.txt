I stand before a line in the sand
The fight lies ahead; fate in my hands
Today, the end begins
One step and the battle is born
The road that I walk is a gathering storm
Today, the end begins...

And if it was up to me
I'd rewrite history
And change my destiny
One last time

Betrayed my father again
This is the last time; I'm the Mega of men
Today, I change the end
Hi, Rock. My weapon is hot
It's time to throw down; Show me what you got
Today, we change the end...

And if it was up to me
I'd rewrite history
And change my destiny
One last time

And you says, why do you fight? (There's a sound before the fight)
How can you say you know what's right?
What if we win? What if we fall? (A song before the fall)
Will any choice that we make
Matter at all?
I know I can win, I've done it before
Get out of my way, I gotta settle the score
One last time

(He's the prototype man of Mega Man!)

And if it was up to me
I'd rewrite history
And change my destiny
One last time

One last time

And now it's up to me
To go make history
And meet my destiny
One last time

One last time...
