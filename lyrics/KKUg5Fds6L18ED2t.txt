In my mind
In my mind
It was oh so fine

Happy now
Happy gone
I am often wrong

Put me on
Scissor me
Then you leave me be

Cut me out
Knead me too
You can paint me blue

You can always play with
You can always play with
You can always play with

Always one
Once again
I'll be your best friend

Paper doll
Paper doll
Paper doll

You can always play with
You can always play with
You can always play with

Me
