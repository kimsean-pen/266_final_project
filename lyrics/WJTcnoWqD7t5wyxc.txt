And I've been waiting for you
There's nothing that I'd rather do
You stop me from falling in the ground
Please don't leave me alone
I won't cope on my own

I dunno who to trust
Don't let me do my worst
I don't know who to trust

Running away doesn't feel so bad
No running away doesn't feel so bad

There's a monster inside of you
Someone that you never knew
Someone that we didn't choose
He won't leave us alone
Please don't leave me alone

I dunno who to trust,
Don't let me do my worst
I don't know who to trust

There's no love too small
There's no love too small

Will you take my love instead?
And help me rest my head
And I'll forget everything they said
And if you take my love instead

There's no love too small
There's no love too small

And I won't be surprised if it kills us all
And I won't be surprised if it kills us all
There's no love too small
And I won't be surprised if it kills us all
There's no love too small
There's no love too small
