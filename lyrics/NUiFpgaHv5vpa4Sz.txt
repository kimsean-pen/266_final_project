Luckily I got a book of tricks
Know what I gotta do to get my kicks
Cos I've read every single page
And I wouldn't say I'm crazy but

If you look in my eye
You might be surprised
I get a little dangerous
I get a little dangerous

We gotta live a little, be naughty but nice
Just to give a little
A freak show show let's live a little
I'm gonna get what I want, so give a little

We gotta live a little, be naughty but nice
Just to give a little
A freak show show let's live a little
I'm gonna get what I want, so give a little

We're about to break
And I don't know how much more of this
You can take
I wanna see the animal in you escape
Oh can you feel the fire burning
Through your veins
You're about to break

We gotta live a little, be naughty but nice
Just to give a little
A freak show show let's live a little
I'm gonna get what I want, so give a little
