And I wanna build buildings high for you
But the costs, my God, the costs I can't afford you
But I always choose another way
And this is why this love can't stay

But I wanna change, change the way we always have
And to make different plans and try not to make this sad
But I always choose another way
And this is why this love can't stay

Little by little
You gonna hear me cry
Hear me cry
Why

But I wanna smell, smell the way you do
And to wear those clothes, the clothes your friends do
But I always choose another way
So this is why this love can't stay

Little by little
You gonna hear me cry
Hear me cry
Why

And I know that it started somewhere
And I really like it now, yes, I really like it now
I like it now

See I got a plan, a plan to get us out of here
If we only can use your money
Then we can definitely get out of here
You see I always screw it up someway
But this is why this love can't stay, can't stay

Little by little
You gonna hear me cry
Hear me cry
Why

And I know that it started somewhere
I really like it now and I really like it now
I like it now

And when we started, yeah we started from there
And you were very loud, yes, you were very loud
But I really like that, very loud, like that, you were very loud
