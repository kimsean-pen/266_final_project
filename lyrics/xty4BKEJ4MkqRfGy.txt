Strains of your anxiety
Touch the force that makes you see
And you bathe in blood eternally
With no stretch you run could ever come in

Never question who it's for
You wait until the time made for
And you bathe in blood forever more
Broken inside

As they watch you die
Bleed your carcass dry
Then there's more they'll take
To make together in the crimson rain

Strains of your anxiety
Touch the force that makes you see
And you bathe in blood eternally
With no stretch you run could ever come in
