Remember when I was your baby
I was always sneaking in your mind
Remember when we loved like crazy
Both without anything to hide

I was your lover, I was your friend
And you never had to question it
Don't know who to blame, no matter who's fault
Somehow we lost it all

I remember
When you loved me
I remember
When you loved me

They say you know, yeah you know when it's over
It hurts when it's over
Remember when you used to lay your head on my shoulder
It made us feel closer

I remember
When you loved me
I remember
When you loved me
When you loved me
When you loved me

No, you didn't know (You didn't know)
You didn't know
You messed up my head
No, never (never) no no never
(No no never) Again

I remember
When you told me you loved me you was game for that
Now you too good for that
I remember
You'd always check up on your baby

I remember
When you loved me
I remember
When you loved me
When you loved me
When you loved me
When you loved me
When you loved, loved, loved
Loved me
