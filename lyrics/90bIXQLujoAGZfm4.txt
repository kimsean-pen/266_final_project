Lovers, beg your forgiveness right now.
Fathers, speak to your kids, right now.
To the prince, to the king, to the fathers of the free,
beg for your workers, and pray to god for me.
Bleeding hearts meet bleeding crowns.
All hope, is only around, right now.
Prisoners of love, forgive them, right now.
Prisoners of love, forgive them, and speak.
Right Now!
Now!
