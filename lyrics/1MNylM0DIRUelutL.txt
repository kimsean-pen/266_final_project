Your back's against the wall
There's no-one home to call
You're forgetting who you are
You can't stop crying
It's part not giving in
And part trusting your friends
You do it all again
And I'm not lying

Oh oh oh oh ohh Oh ohh
Oh ohh Oh oh oh oh ohh Oh ohh

Standing in the way of control
You live your life
Survive the only way that you know

I'm doing this for you
Because it's easier to lose
And it's hard to face the truth
When you think you're dying
It's part not giving in
And part trusting your friends
You do it all again
But you don't stop trying

Oh oh oh oh ohh Oh ohh
Oh ohh Oh oh oh oh ohh Oh ohh

Standing in the way of control
You live your life
Survive the only way that you know

Oh ohh Oh oh oh oh ohh Oh ohh
Oh ohh Oh oh oh oh ohh Oh ohh

Standing in the way of control
We live our lives
Because we're standing in the way of control
We will live our lives
Because we're standing in the way of control
We live our lives
Because we're standing in the way of control
We will live our lives

Your back's against the wall
There's no-one home to call
You're forgetting who you are
You can't stop crying
It's part not giving in
And part trusting your friends
You do it all again
You don't stop trying

Oh oh oh oh ohh Oh ohh
Oh ohh Oh oh oh oh ohh Oh ohh

Standing in the way of control
You live your life
Survive the only way that you know
