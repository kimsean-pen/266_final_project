Love like waves

Love like waves

Love like waves

Now we're getting real
This is where we leave them far behind
So let's make a deal
To keep an open mind

With you it seems so wild to fight
It seems so wild to deny
Love like this is hard to find
Love like this is ours

Close to the line
Since you've been on my mind
Now the storm subsides
Love like waves
Holding so long
'Til the feeling comes on
Breaking love like waves
Love like waves

Love like waves

Stare into the deep
I can see reflections of my life
Where I could have been
And other story lines

The blue between the earth and sky
White horses surf on the tide
A love like this is hard to find
A love like this is ours

Close to the line
Since you've been on my mind
Now the storm subsides
Love like waves
Carried away
Spending all of my days
Searching far and wide
Love like waves

It's been up and down
But my heart's coming round
As the sunlight fades
Love like waves
Holding so long
'Til the feeling comes on
Breaking up like waves
Love like waves

We can dive deeper
If we share breath underwater
We can dive deeper
If we share breath underwater

With you it seems so wild to fight
It seems so wild to deny
Love like this is hard to find
Love like this is ours

Love like waves
It's been up and down
But my heart's coming round
Love like waves
It's been up and down
But my heart's coming round
Love like waves

Love like waves
