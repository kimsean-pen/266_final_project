I feel stupid
But I know it won't last for long
And I've been guessing
But I could've been guessing wrong

You don't know me now
I kinda thought that you should somehow
It's that whole mad season got you down
I feel stupid

But its something that comes and goes
And I've been changing

I think its funny how no one knows
And we don't talk about the little things that we do without
When the whole mad season comes around
So why you gotta stand there looking like the answer now

It seems to me you come around
And I need you now
Do you think you can cope
You've figured me out

That I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken

Though I've never spoken
I come undone
In this mad season
I feel stupid

But I think I've been catching on
I feel ugly
But I know I still turn you on
You've grown colder now

Torn apart angry, turned around

Will that whole mad season knock you down
So are you gonna stand there
Or are you gonna help me out

We need to be together now
I need you now
Do you think you can cope
You figured me out
That I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken
Though I've never spoken
I come undone
In this mad season
And now I'm crying
Isn't that what you want
And I'm trying to live my life on my own
But I'm holding on to old times
I do believe I am strong
So someone tell me why, why, why
Do I, I, I
Feel stupid
And I come undone
Well I come undone
I need you now
Do you think you can cope, you figured me out
That I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken
Though I've never spoken
Well I need you now
Do you think you can cope
You figured me out
I'm a child and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken
Though I've never spoken
I come, oh, come undone
In this mad season
In this mad season
It's been a mad season
Been a mad season, oh
