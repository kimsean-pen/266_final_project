Hey Jude, don't make it bad, take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her in your heart then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid, you were made, made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin, then you'll begin to make it better

Any time you feel the pain, Hey Jude, refrain, don't carry the world upon
Your shoulder, for you know that it's a fool who plays it cool by makin
The world, alittle bit colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down, you found her, now go on out and get her
But remember, to let her in your heart, then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, Hey Jude, begin, you waited for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, Hey Jude, you do, the movements you need is
On your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad, take a sad song and make it better, just remember
To let her under your skin, then you'll begin to make it better

Ow! Ow! Hey Jude! Ow! Hey, Hey! Yeah! It's gonna be alright!
Hey, Jude, Jude, you'll be alright, Hey Hey Hey Hey
You'll be alright Jude, Heeey, Heeey, Heeey, It's got-ta, it's got-ta, it's got-ta
Yeah, Hey Jude! (Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, Hey Hey Jude
