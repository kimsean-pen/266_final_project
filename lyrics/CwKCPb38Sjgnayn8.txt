Erase your words and die.
We are the livide elite protesters.
The faces of justice.
And your reign has come to an end.
We will hold your head high above your lifeless carcass.

We are the livide elite protesters.
The faces of justice.

Dethroned, de-ranked, we'll take away everything.
And rip your throat out and set you aflame.
I will not pledge, for I stand against every word.
One nation under hypocrisy.

We will not live in, one nation under hypocrisy.
We are the faces.
Of justice fueling anarchy.

And your reign has come to an end.
We will hold your head high above your lifeless carcass.

We are the livide elite protesters.
The faces of justice.

The masses cringe as they watch you burm, and we stain the eath with your blood.
Justice has been served.

If you dare, step on this pedestal and promise us change.
We'll change the features on your face.

One nation under hypocrisy.

Erase your words and die.
We are the livide elite protesters.
The faces of justice.
I will not pledge, for I stand against every word.
One nation under hypocrisy.

We will not live in, one nation under hypocrisy.
We are the faces.
Of justice fueling anarchy.

One nation under hypocrisy.
