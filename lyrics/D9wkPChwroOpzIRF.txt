The awakening of darkened skies
(Falling from the dark)
The symphony of dying lights
(Behold the rain of stars)
The blazing fire came pouring down
(Falling from the dark)
And life and death became unbound

Sons of winter and stars!
Rise!
Sons of winter and stars!
Rise!

Sons of winter and stars!
Rise!
Rise!

Fly with us through the darkness (Sons of winter and stars! Rise! Rise!)
And we shall embrace the stars (Sons of winter and stars!)
And we shall open the doors of time (Rise! Rise!)

I have awaken the darkness
(Taste the fear!)
(Taste the pain!)
I am the one who seeks vengeance
(I am the one who seeks vengeance)

Into the darkness we fly
Into the shadows they hide
Into the darkness we fly
They will never survive
They'll die
Oh, they will die!

I sacrifice everything
Just for one moment
I throw away everything
That matters to me the most

I'm flying through the darkness
The fire casts a shadow on me
I tear a part of my heart for creation of dimensions
And we fly beyond the restless shadows
We fly beyond the stars
We fly beyond the birth of the worlds

So old I've become (Thousand years staring into emptiness)
But now I realize (That it was just an illusion)
All this time I thought it was you that would save the sun
Oh rain comes and washes the hate away (Washes the hate away)
Now I am at the crossroads with questions (With questions!)
Somewhere, someday I will find what I am here for
Who am I?

I'm wondering now where will you take me
From the horizon the light comes alive
Into the mountains high we set our way
Will we find our way in this long winter night

I see the land of fading sun and rising mountains
And I finally feel that I've found my home
But oh, how it feels so cold when
My dreams wither in fragments of time
Revealing that this land will die

Before the winds so cold (Falling snow)
The world was shattered in the fragments of time (So soft and cold)
Before the autumn rains (Dying moon cast down so weak)
The coldness will again awake
Frozen lake, the dancing spirits
Calling me to join in the cosmic dream
The silence is tempting me now...

We are the sons of winter and stars
We've come from a far beyond time
Forever the fire burns in our hearts
Our world shall never die
In the arms of the wind we ride till dawn
As the waves of the ocean grind so strong
We wander in the stars until we're gone
Our fate is sealed by eternal sun

We are the sons of winter and stars
We've come from a far beyond time
Forever the fire burns in our hearts
Our world shall never die
In the arms of the wind we ride till dawn
As the waves of the ocean grind so strong
We wander in the stars until we're gone
Our fate is sealed by eternal sun

Until we fade away (Fate will find it's way)
Until we drift into the dark
It's not too late to find a way (Fate will find it's way)
And fly in cold embrace of stars

Until we fade away (Mysteries of time)
Until we drift into the dark (Unfolding in cosmic dreams)
It's not too late to find a way (Leaving life and death meaningless)
And fly in cold embrace of stars (Before the revelation of infinity)
Embrace the stars!

The energy flows in me like a river of stars
(The energy flows in me like a river of stars)
I'm surrounded by the circle of fire
But eternal ice has frozen my heart
I'm lost in the pathways of time
Now the time has come for us!

We are the sons of winter and stars
We've come from a far beyond time
Forever the fire burns in our hearts
Our world shall never die
In the arms of the wind we ride till dawn
As the waves of the ocean grind so strong
We wander in the stars until we're gone
Our fate is sealed by eternal sun

We are the sons of winter and stars!
We are the sons of winter and stars!
