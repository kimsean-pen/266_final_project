An empty word
Falling from inside
My empty head
Inside I think
Everything finally comes and goes
And nothing leaves anymore
Falling deeper into someone else
Falling deeper into someone I (don't) know
One way or another
I seem to have lost my place in this world
I feel as if things around me
Suddenly lost all meaning
All relevance
I don't know where I'm going anymore
Wish someone could tell
I must be blind or asleep
All I think I see is no one
