Easy, coming closer every day
Easy, you are mine
Easy, coming close to what you wanna be
Sieze it like a new day

You were born to make resistance
You were born into the wild
You were flying through the fire of night
You know it's true in so may ways
You know it's never too late

Easy, coming closer you and me
Easy, don't hide
Meet me in the shallows of a quiet bay
Kiss me without warning

You were born to make resistance
You were born into the wild
You were flying through the fire of night
You know the stakes
You know what it takes

You know it's never ever too late
For the light I see in you

You were born to make resistance
You were born into the wild
You were flying through the fire of night
You know it's true
You know what it takes

Into the wild
Into the wild
Into the wild
