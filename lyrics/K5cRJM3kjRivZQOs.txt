Why should I believe if God's not here to save me?

Condemned by our lord and our savior
I know now that I'm the son of no man
Knowing of the traps you've set for me
Why should I even try to save myself?

Oh father, yes father
For you I'll have this world on its knees
Oh father, yes father
For you I'll spread their legs like disease

... And I stood on the sand of the sea and I saw,
Saw a beast rising up out of the sea
Having seven heads and ten horns,
And on his horns ten crowns,
And on his heads, name of blasphemy*

*Revelation 13: 1, King James
