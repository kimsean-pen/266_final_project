I'm changing
last breath to take
collapsing
like that building in my mother's town
I swear I'm falling down

That time was hard
we were striving
a wounded mare
with a reckless gambler
and we still don't know
who has won all of this though
I see
mountains
gardens
here we sing for blue birds
and we sound like pure rain
and nobody gets hurt
and you look like a king
of the whole wide world
and nobody gets hurt

And we sing for birds
and we sound like rain
and nobody gets hurt
and you look like a king
of the whole wide world
and nobody gets hurt

That time was hard
we were striving
that time was rough
for every one of us

But you
told me
I would be there for
ever
ever
