I don't know where you came from
You broke foundations while I'm
Falling down the middle
Crawling round a little
We shoot through constellations
Two scorpions racing
While I'm falling down the middle
Crawling round a little

I won't lose my grip, don't let go

I think I found that something
I think I'll finally breathe right in
I think I feel that love I won't give up
I think you soaked into my skin
So much has come from nothing
I think I found that something

Was picking up pieces when you
Gave me a reason to be
Fallin' down the middle
Crawling round a little
And I see that space in your head
And I want to fill it in
And I see that space in your bed
And I want to be in it
Fallin' down the middle
Crawling round a little

I won't lose my grip, don't let go
No I won't lose my grip, don't let go

I think I found that something
I think I'll finally breathe right in
I think I feel that love I won't give up
I think you soaked into my skin
So much has come from nothing
I think I found that something
I think I found that something

I think I found that something
I think I'll finally breathe right in
I think I feel that love I won't give up
I think you soaked into my skin
So much has come from nothing
I think I found that something
I think I found that something
I think I'll finally breathe right in
I think I feel that love I won't give up
I think you soaked into my skin
So much has come from nothing
I think I found that something
So much has come from nothing
I think I found that something
(Yeah)
