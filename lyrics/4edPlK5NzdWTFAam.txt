Encore, night is almost over
I'm bored and wanna leave
It felt good before, but now it's getting older
'Cause there's no more empathy

Final firework of summer, your phone falls into the fire
It's the last act of a dying cellphone
Last call of a desperate man

Empty wine bottles in my room
When I wake up I think of you
It's our grand finale

Drugstore, 24 hour market
We'll go before we see

Final firework of summer, your phone falls into the fire
It's the last act of a dying cellphone
Last call of a desperate man

Empty wine bottles in my room
When I wake up I think of you
It's our grand finale (finale)

Empty wine bottles in my room
When I wake up I think of you
It's our grand finale

It's the last act of a dying cellphone
Last call of a desperate man
A strange sense of relief
Strange sense of relief

Empty wine bottles in my room
When I wake up I think of you
It's our grand finale (finale)

Empty wine bottles in my room
When I wake up I think of you
It's our grand finale
