carley is hardly a part of me but angie is living inside of me.
i'm living for the living.
guess i should be giving, and living how i'm living, guess i should be giving in.
spiders are living inside of us.
the party is running away from me.
i'm living for the living.
guess i should be giving, and living how i'm living, yes i should be giving in.
changing, leaving, guess i was only dreaming.
carley, angie, know that im always dreaming...
