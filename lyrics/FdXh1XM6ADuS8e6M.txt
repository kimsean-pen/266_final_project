Well I'm going out
I'm gonna find myself a lover
I'm gonna look until I drop
I'll never stop
I won't give up in any way
Shape or form

Well I'm going out
I'm gonna find myself a girl
Take her out into the world
We'll learn to dance
We'll take a chance
We'll start romance all over again

Love is lies, love is eyes
Love is everything that's nice
Love is not as cold as ice
But that's what that means to me

Well I'm going out
I'm gonna find myself someone
Going to see them just for fun
A love affair
But noone there
It's in my head now it's all gone

Love is lies, love is eyes
Love is everything that's nice
Love is not cold as ice
But that's what that means to me

Well I'm going out
I'm gonna find myself a girl
Take her out into the world
We'll learn to dance
We'll take a chance
We'll start romance all over again

Love is lies, love is eyes
Love is everything that's nice
Love is not as cold as ice
But that's what that means to me

Well I'm going out
I'm gonna find myself someone
Going to see them just for fun
A love affair
But no one there
It's in my head, now it's all gone

Love is lies, love is eyes
Love is everything that's nice
Love is not as cold as ice
But that's what that means to me

Love is lies, love is eyes
Love is everything that's nice
Love is not as cold as ice
But that's what that means to me
