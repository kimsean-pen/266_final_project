We've been through hell and back so who are you
To make me feel attacked?
I've found myself beginning to change
I'm turning into someone I can't take

I thought we could put it all to rest
Let the past go but I can't forget
Aaa-ha-ha

Tell me all the reasons you treat me this way
When you're feeling low to make yourself okay
Tell me all the reasons you treat me this way
When you're feeling low to make yourself okay

I've been focused on a life including you to be right by my side
Pull the plug and watch me drown
All I see is your lies now

I thought we could put it all to rest
Let the past go but I can't forget

Can't get this out of my head
And all I see is this sweat on your soul
Now you're hollowed out

Tell me all the reasons you treat me this way
When you're feeling low to make yourself okay
Tell me all the reasons you treat me this way
When you're feeling low to make yourself okay

I don't see how you look at me now
Knowing I could never look at you the same
I'd rather lie to myself at night
And keep all of this hope alive

I'm aiming high, you're shooting low
You took it too far, now there's nowhere left to go
I'm aiming high, you're shooting low
Took it too far, nowhere left to go

Tell me all the reasons you treat me this way
When you're feeling low to make yourself okay
Tell me all the reasons you treat me this way
When you're feeling low to make yourself okay
