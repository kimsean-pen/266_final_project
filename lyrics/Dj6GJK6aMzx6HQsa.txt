Solitary boy from the get-go
Call me Hugh Hef 'cause I get hoes
Life is hard as fuck, but I'm blessed though
She hit me on my phone, I don't check, no
You want me gone, spacin' in and out
Used to laugh at me, but I don't see them laughin' now
Got a cloud 'bove my head, yeah
I'm blessed, but I'm cursed
Wanna get rid of it, I'll do whatever works

We ain't friends
Where were you back when I was nothin' at all?
You don't care if I come up, you only care if I fall
So when I'm sellin' shows don't act like you was part of it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh
