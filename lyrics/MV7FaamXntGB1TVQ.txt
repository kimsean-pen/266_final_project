Baby, it's cool with me that you like to lie
'cause I see the depression filling up your eyes
And I see the oceans overflowing
Babe, It's cool with me that you want to die
And I'm not gonna stop you if you try
But the hole in my belly has started growing

Your name is about as easy to remember as the four ethers
And who the hell knows the four ethers?
Your pain is about as easy to feel as the four ethers?
And who could do without the four ethers?

Babe, I know you learned some fucked up shit from your mother
Had you tucking your dick
Had you hiding the shit that would have made you special
Show me yourself

Baby, I know you picked up some fucked up habits from your father
Had folding over your ears, denying the shit that you hear
But I'm asking you to feel me

Your name is impossible to know, you're like my four ethers
How the hell do you know the four ethers?
Your pain is impossible to hold, you're like the four ethers
Baby, what do I do with these four ethers
Your name is like the four ethers, what do I do with these four ethers?

I can't draw you no warm bath no more
How can I touch somebody who won't even touch themselves?
It's tiring to me.

I'm fine with you being a liar
I'm fine with you being a killer
I'm fine with you being suicidal
That shit don't bother me, no
But you've gotta show me yourself
oh, you've gotta show me yourself
