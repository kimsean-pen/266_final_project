Know Your Rights All Three Of Them

Number 1
You Have The Right Not To Be Killed
Murder Is A Crime!
Unless It Was Done By A
Policeman Or Aristocrat
Know Your Rights

And Number 2
You Have The Right To Food Money
Providing Of Course You
Don't Mind A Little
Investigation, Humiliation
And If You Cross Your Fingers
Rehabilitation

Know Your Rights
These Are Your Rights

Know These Rights

Number 3
You Have The Right To Free
Speech As Long As You're Not
Dumb Enough To Actually Try It.

Know Your Rights
These Are Your Rights
All Three Of 'Em
It Has Been Suggested
In Some Quarters That This Is Not Enough!
Well...

Get Off The Streets
Get Off The Streets
Run
You Don't Have A Home To Go To
Smush

Finally Then I Will Read You Your Rights

You Have The Right To Remain Silent
You Are Warned That Anything You Say
Can And Will Be Taken Down
And Used As Evidence Against You

Listen To This
