Have you ever walked alone at night
Like a man against the world?
No one takes your side
A boat against the tide
When your faith is shaken
You start to break
And your heart can't find the words
Tossed upon the sand

I give you a man against the world
All the people cheer till the end is near
And the hero takes a fall
Then they'll drag you through the mud
You're only flesh and blood
Oh I've walked the path from dark to light
And have yet to come to terms
Alone I take my stand
I'm only a man against the world
But love!
Like a distant reminder
It tugs at my shoulder
It calls me home
I shout!
Can a single voice carry?
Will I find santuary
Within your arms?
Someday when the answer's clearer
Someday when I even the score
You'll reach and you'll find me near you
Right beside you
Forevermore!

But for now I walk the night alone
Like a man against the world
A brand new day will shine
Through the avalanche of time
Now the road's grown long
But the spirit's gone
And the fire within still burns
Alone I take my stand
I give you a man against the world
