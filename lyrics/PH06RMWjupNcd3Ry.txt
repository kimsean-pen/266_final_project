It's all about you
(It's all about you)
It's all about you, baby
(It's all about)
It's all about you
(It's about you)
It's all about you

Yesterday, you asked me something I thought you knew
So, I told you with a smile, "It's all about you"
Then you whispered in my ear and you told me too
Said, "You make my life worthwhile, it's all about you"

And I would answer all your wishes, if you asked me to
But if you deny me one of your kisses, don't know what I'd do
So, hold me close and say three words, like you used to do
Dancing on the kitchen tiles, it's all about you
Yeah!

And I would answer all your wishes, if you asked me to
But if you deny me one of your kisses, don't know what I'd do
So, hold me close and say three words, like you used to do
Dancing on the kitchen tiles
Yes, you make my life worthwhile

So, I told you with a smile, "It's all about you"
It's all about you
(It's about you)
It's all about you, baby
(It's all about)
It's all about you
(It's about you)
It's all about you, baby
(It's all about you)
It's all about you
(It's about you)
It's all about you, baby
(It's all about you)
It's all about you
(It's about you)
It's all about you
It's all about
You
