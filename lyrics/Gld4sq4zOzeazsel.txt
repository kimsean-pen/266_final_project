Per left per tree per misery
and it feels so wrong
and we ride 'round town in a limousine
and we get it on
You grow your hair just to look like me
but it's much too long
You cut your arm just to watch it bleed
and it feels so warm
and you're driving away to do
leave it all behind dont bother me
i did it for the world underneath
walk across the water
like some kind of jesus freak
oh come on man, dont smother me
cause it can go on
and we ride 'round town in a limousine
and we get it on
and you're driving away to do
leave it all behind dont bother me
and if all the world is swimming underneath
walk across the water
like some kind of jesus freak
hey dont look at me like that
man thats no way to act
dont tell me that you understand
oh please dont lie to me man
its pretty clear
for all to see
