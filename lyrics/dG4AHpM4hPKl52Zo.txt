Throw it all away for you
Just like you asked me to
You can always be my waste of time
And when things don't go to plan it
If you deserve another chance
I can? On you to take your time
And boy i'm getting tired of your games
You just don't stop speking
Done done with fellings for you boy
I'm getting bored of your eyes
You can keep on calling
I am done with falling
You just watched that
