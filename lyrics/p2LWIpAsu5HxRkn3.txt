I went to see you at the Hospital
I found you laying in your room
I Stood by your bedside every night
I did my best to comfort you

It's the morphine and the painkillers
That left you tired and confused
They said the cancer wasn't cureable
They said there's nothing they could do

(what is happening?)
I don't believe a word they say
(what is happening?)
I couldn't watch you fade away

All I'm saying is the ending scares me every time
Your words replaying
Over and over I save them in my mind
Now I'm grabbing a hold
Of what's about to unfold
I'm walking hospital halls now that you're gone
All I'm saying
Is I still call your answering machine

I know
I've been busy now the last little while
I've got a, small apartment in Ottawa
I've got a girl with a beautiful smile
I've got dreams, I've got needs
I've got things I believe
That I just can not let go
I still, think about you every single day
I still miss that old North Hansen Home
Sometimes I wanna go home

All I'm saying is the ending scares me every time
Your words replaying
Over and over I save them in my mind
Now I'm grabbing a hold
Of what's about to unfold
I'm walking hospital halls now that you're gone
All I'm saying
Is I still call your answering machine

I'm so scared I'm trembling
Your words worth remembering
I'm so scared I'm trembling
Your words worth remembering
