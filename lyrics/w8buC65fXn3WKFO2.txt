I'm a little rock on a big mountain
Nobody's calling my name
Nobody's payin me mind
I'm a little drop from a big fountain
Oh I blend in and that's fine

My sister she is gonna die tryin
with her hear ablaze and a fightin song
Not me, I'll be a dandelion
Give a gust of wind and I'm gone

Cuz I don't wanna be somebody to anybody no
I'm good at no one

Once I was loved but I wouldn't dare
Take a compliment or give a kiss
Just thinking of bein a pair
Had me suffering and made me split

Cuz I dont wanna be somebody to anybody no
I'm good at no one

I keep my head down and both eyes wide
I don't look up just side to side
And I stay well kept so they can see
There's nothin wrong with me

Its just that I don't wanna be somebody to anybody no
I dont wanna be somebody to anybody no
I dont wanna be somebody to anybody no
I'm good at no one
