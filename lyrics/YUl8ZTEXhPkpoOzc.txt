Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret. A maiden I will dee

But I'll turn into a nightengale and song will warm my heart
Well I'll turn into a threshing machine and tear that bird apart

Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret. A maiden I will dee

But I'll turn into a vampire in case you own a neck
Well I'll turn into a silver cross and send me back to heck

Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret. A maiden I will dee

But I'll turn into a hydrogen bomb and atomize the air
Well I'll turn into a cockroack and you'll see if i care

Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret. A maiden I will dee

But I'll turn into a super nova and burn up everything
Well I'll turn into a black little hole and you'll turn into string

Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret. A maiden I will dee

But I'll turn into GOD himself and you will come to me
Then i will not believe in you and then where will you be

Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget Untwinkle, little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret. A maiden I will dee
