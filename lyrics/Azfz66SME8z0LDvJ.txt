Somewhere between low expectations
And a decade long malaise
A slimy well of self-deprecation
And a fucked up fight picking phase

You look good in that
I mean it
Maybe lose the shirt though

See, I told you so
Just admit it
You are the next big thing
This shoot is pure gold
Platinum even
I take no credit, you're the reason

You look good in that
I mean it
Maybe lose the shirt though
I was young and I needed the money

You've got a rare energy
You're a natural
A regular Tony Ward

You look good in that
No, I really mean it
You look good in that
Maybe lose the shirt though
