Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
(Candyman, candyman)
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
(Sweet, sugar, candyman)

Hey-hey-yay, uh

I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really got me working up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm

He's a one stop shop, makes my panties drop
He's a sweet talkin', sugar-coated candyman
A sweet-talkin' sugar-coated candyman

Ooh yeah, yeah-yeah

He took me to the Spider Club at Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise (A big surprise)
The gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline

He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated candyman (Oh, yeah)
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated candyman

Wah-doo-boo-doo-dwee-dop
Bah-choo-bah-bah-boo-dah
Dwee-dum-bow, bop-bow
Hey, yeah
Yeah-eh-eh-eh-eh, yeah, yeah
(Sha-doo-bah-dee-bah, doo-bah-dwee-dum-bow)
Oh, yeah, dwee-dum-bow

He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet talkin', sugar coated candyman
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated candyman

Woah yeah, yeah

Well, by now, I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth, it really hit the spot
He had lips like sugarcane
Good things come for boys who wait

Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
(Candyman, candyman)
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
(Candyman, candyman)

(Sweet, sugar, candyman)
He's a one stop, gotcha hot, making all the panties drop
(Sweet, sugar, candyman)
He's a one stop, got me hot, making my (uh) pop
(Sweet, sugar, candyman)
He's a one stop, get it while it's hot, baby don't stop
(Sweet, sugar...)

He got those lips like sugarcane
Good things come for boys who wait

He's a one stop shop with a real big (ugh)
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated candyman (Say, what?)
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman (Say...)
A sweet talkin', sugar-coated candyman (Woo!)
A sweet talkin', sugar-coated candyman

Ahh...(Candyman, candyman, candyman)
Eh-eh-eh-eh-ey (Candyman)
Oh, woah (Candyman, candyman)

(Candyman, candyman)
(Candyman, candyman...)

Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
(Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine)
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
(Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine)
Jane lost her grip and down she fell
(Jane lost her grip and down she fell)
Squared herself away as she let out a yell
(Squared herself away as she let out a yell)
