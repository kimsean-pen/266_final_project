You've got it all
Six seven times
You've got it all
Makes me feel so fine
And it's all there is

It's typical of you
Standing out in the pouring rain
It's typical of you
Looking like you do

And the day I'll catch your eye
Could another chance come by
I should really know by now
Would I ask you anyhow?

It's typical of you
Looking like you do
It's typical of you
Love me like you do

You've got it all
Six seven times
You've got it all
Makes me feel so fine

You've got it all
Six seven times
You've got it all
Makes me feel so fine
And it's all there is

It's typical of you
Standing out in the pouring rain
It's typical of you
Looking so, so good

There's moonlight and it's warm outside
Just a little breeze come by
I'm afraid to trip and fall
Do you really exist at all?

It's typical of you
Looking like you do
So typical of you
Love me like you do

You've got it all
Six seven times
You've got it all
Makes me feel so fine

You've got it all
Six seven times
You've got it all
Makes me feel so fine
And it's all there is
It's all there is
And it's all there is
It's all there is
So...
All there is
So...
All there is
