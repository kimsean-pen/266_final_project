I couldn't wait to close the door
Nobody sees you take this form
Every inch that I can trace
Is everything that I could wish for

It's your move
It's your move
It's your move
It's your move

Nobody wants to tell you no
Hungry for all the truth you know
Holding what no one else can say
Hiding what no one else can show

It's your move
It's your move
It's your move
It's your move

In a perfect now
Funny that we're crying
When we both come down
I wish you could
Kiss me when I'm dying

It's your move
I couldn't wait to close the door
Kiss me when I'm dying
It's your move
Nobody sees you take this form
I don't want to come down

It's your move
I couldn't wait to close the door
Kiss me when I'm dying
It's your move
Nobody sees you take this form
I don't want to come down
I don't want to come down
I don't want to come down
