The mornin' sun
Shines on your skin
'Cause your white curtains
They are, paper thin

Windows open
I can feel the breeze
But we're safe here
Under the sheets

I don't ever wanna leave
I'll watch you sleep
And listen to you breathe
I don't ever wanna leave
I'll watch you sleep
I'll watch you sleep

I never get
Bored of lookin' at you
'Cause every time
I see somethin' new

Like the scar on your spine
You fell off our roof
When you were nine
You've lived a life
Before me

I don't ever wanna leave
I'll watch you sleep
And listen to you breathe
I don't ever wanna leave
I'll watch you sleep
I'll watch you sleep

(I don't ever wanna leave)
(I'll watch you sleep)
(I'll watch you sleep)
(I don't ever wanna leave)
(I'll watch you sleep)
(I'll watch you sleep)

(Sleep, oh oh)
(I'll watch you)
(Sleep)
