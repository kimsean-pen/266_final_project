You're kneeling down
even as you watch the tide approach your home,
woah
you breathe in,
trapped in a lion's den again
and undertow
woahoh

I'm barely holding on,
you were the only one,
you were the only one,
just barely holding on,
you were the only one,
you were the only one,

A slow dive,
below the surface of the night,
will overflow
woahoh

In moonlight,
a flaming ember reignites,
then blows out cold

I'm barely holding on,
you were the only one,
you were the only one,
(nothing left to run from)
just barely holding on,
you were the only one,
you were the only one,

I'm barely holding on,
you were the only one,
you were the only one,
just barely holding on,
you were the only one,
you were the only one,

I can't pretend it's not the end,
lovers, then friends, strangers, again.

I'm barely holding on,
(I'm holding on)
you were the only one,
you were the only one,
(nothing left to run from)
just barely holding on,
(just holding on)
you were the only one,
you were the only one
