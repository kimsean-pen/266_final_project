I spent my time back then thinking of nothing but them
The dead ends of my thoughts; the last friends in my head.
And you heard me, you heard me, you heard me my friend
Sent the ship over seas to save me from death.
Through the storms I have weathered through the dark and the rain
You sent me the ship that I sail on today.

And the boat sails on like you sang in your song
And my mind feels clearer several years on.
And the ship that was sailing on those storm ridden seas was my heart
And your words gave my heart back to me.

My mind was a turbine that fueled all the storms
And those words were the courage in which calmness took form.
Through the storms I have weathered through the dark and the rain
You sent me the ship that I sail on today.

And the boat sails on like you sang in your song
And my mind feels clearer several years on.
And the ship that was sailing on those storm ridden seas was my heart
And your words gave my heart back to me.

I've found life, found the strength in myself to grow up
I've found friends, and the strength and the want to live
And the ship that was sailing on those storm ridden seas was my heart
And your words gave my heart back to me.

Through the storms I have weathered through the dark and the rain.
And the boat sails on like you sang in your song
And my mind feels clearer several years on.
And the boat sails on like you sang in your song
And my mind feels clearer several years on.

And the boat sails on like you sang in your song
And my mind feels clearer several years on.
And the ship that was sailing on those storm ridden seas was my heart
And your words gave me heart back to me.
