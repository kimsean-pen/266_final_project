If you want some love and you don't know how
Gotta tell that girl, gotta tell her now
Gotta give her time, gotta give her more
If you want that girl, gotta let her know

If you want that girl, gotta let her see
Gotta burn inside, gotta let it be
If you want that girl and you don't know why
oh it's only gonna drive you crazy

Don't wait for someone to change your life
Don't settle for less than you deserve
Don't waste a minute of your precious time
Don't wait for someone, go change your life

Hey boy, watcha got?
Don't leave me on the phone
Don't want no trouble in the house
Hey boy, watcha got?
Can't take this anymore
You might just be my hero

Get outta your head, get into your heart
Get outta your head, get into your heart
Get outta your head, get into your heart
Hey Boy, watcha got?

Hey boy, watcha got?
Can't take this anymore
Don't want no trouble in the house

If you want some love, but you can't say why
Gotta tell that boy, gotta hold him tight
Gotta let him know, gotta let it show
Gotta hope the feeling grows

If you want that guy, gotta let him see
Gotta turn his head, turn up the heat
If you want that guy, gotta make him yours
Your heart's beating and it won't stop baby

Hey boy, watcha got?
Don't leave me on the phone
Don't want no trouble in the house
Hey boy, watcha got?
