She used to rely upon your shoulder
For your compassion to enfold her
For your colorless to calm her red
To the bluest greens and
Clearest clears instead
Now the deepest blushing
Of your lover's kiss
Will live forever in your consciousness
It was red like wine and
Bent your mind the same
To the roar of gold
That you could never tame

Now I can't see you
Were we colorless anyway?
Now I can't feel you

These days I'm terrified of silence
My thoughts unbearable in the quiet
I'm only falling out of comfort here
I'm never falling out of love, I fear
But look what I did now. I said it
Now there's no way
I can forget about it
If the softest press against my
Lovers lips could topple towers of un-confidence

Now I can't see you
Were we colorless anyway?
Now I can't feel you

But suddenly it's fading now
When a colorless world goes dark
But suddenly it's fading now.
It's fading now

Ohh-ohh, I can't save myself, ah-ahh
Ohh-ohh, I can't help myself, ah-ahh

Ohh-ohh, I can't save myself, ah-ahh
Ohh-ohh, I can't help myself, ah-ahh

Ohh-ohh, I can't save myself, ah-ahh
