Previous times you stuck by me
Relations fine undeniably
Mutual trust and honesty
The essential recipe

There's two sides to a coin
Opinions numbered many
Yet resolve came with ease
Compromised and regret - free

Then the vhange of expression
A unit of friends and the chance to be free

Your thoughts on these cast a jealous light
A concensus of hate to accompany

A vindictive acid taste
Flows from your chalice

Valued friendships tainted
Martyr of malice

Then the final straw
Violent intimidation
Your self acclaimed pacification
Brushed aside for self-gratification

Blatant ignorance - martyr of malice
