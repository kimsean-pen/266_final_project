Someone in the world tonight
Is dancing on their own
Trying hard to get it right
Tired of being alone
Unspread open wide
Face up to the sky
There's nobody by your side
Still you're asking why

Is there someone out there to keep you breathing,
Tryina find an answer to somehow stop this feeling
Can you hold on? I'm through in losing!
Is there someone out there really loves you,
In the dark, near or far, find a heart who wants you
Can you hold on? I'm through in losing!

I wonder how you sleep at night,
Are all your roses thorn?
Is everything in black & white,
Since I've been gone?
'Cause I don't know 'bout you now
Now is gone, and ask you if, if your life turns upside down
Whether you still reminisce?
But you know I wish you well, in everything you do
But it's me who left behind, and I have feelings too,
Anyway!

Is there someone out there to keep you breathing,
Tryina find an answer to somehow stop this feeling
Can you hold on? I'm through in losing!
Is there someone out there really loves you,
In the dark, near or far, find a heart who wants you
Can you hold on? I'm through in losing!

I'm through in losing!
I'm through in losing!
