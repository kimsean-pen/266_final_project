O' sister,
What's wrong with your mind?
You used to be, so strong and stable.

My sister, What made you fall from grace?
I'm sorry that I, was not there to catch you.
What have the demons done?
What have the demons done with the luminous light,
That once shined from your eyes?
What makes you feel so alone?
Is it the whispering ghosts, that you fear the most?

But the blackness in your heart won't last forever.
I know it's tearing you apart,
But it's a storm you can weather.

O' sister,
Those lines etched in your hands
They're hardened and rough
Like a road map of sorrow

My sister,
There is a sadness on your face.
You're like a motherless child, whose longing for comfort.

What's running through your veins, that's causing you such pain?
Does it have something to do, with the pills they gave to you?
What is eating at your soul?
Was it the whispering ghost, that left you out in the cold?

But the blackness in your heart, won't, last forever.
I know it's tearing you apart
But it's a storm you can weather.

Oooooh Oooooh Oooooh Oh
O' sister,
My sister.
