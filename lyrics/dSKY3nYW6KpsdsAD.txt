You will find me in the lake, with the death I tried to fake.
And my hands already blue holding photographs of you.
And you'll ask me what it is, why I want to feel like this.
And I'll turn towards the sky and I'll sink before your eyes
But if I was to ask, my little love, my little one.
Could you break my heart? Could you have tried? (what) Could you've done?
To make me pay. Make me pay

Make me pay...
Make me pay for what I've done you
Make me pay for how I loved you
Make me pay Well you'll find me in the woods where the dead do what they should
And my arms already old and my eyes forever cold
And they'll say I never left, that I called them as they slept.
That I haunted every tree till the
forest sang with me

But if it all was true, that I went mad because of you...
Then finally you'd know and you could come and take me home
And take me home. And take me home.

Take me home...
Take me home . and help me love you
Take me home to when I loved you
Take me home
