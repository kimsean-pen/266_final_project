Huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh, oh, oh

Whiskey Tango, from the top
I will blow your mind, I just can't stop
Burn a candle in my name
You can bury me with all my shame

The poison of sadness
The breaking of a heart
The echo of madness tearing us apart
Oohh, it's tearing us apart
I've been falling for the day like I'm falling for the night
I've been running from the darkness 'til I'm running from the light
I've been falling for the day like I'm falling for the night
Tryna' make it better but I just can't get it right
No, I just can't get it right

Do you remember all of my words?
How I promised you what you deserve
I'm a liar, I'm a thief
But I need you more than you need me

The poison of sadness
The breaking of a heart
The echo of madness tearing us apart
Oohh, it's tearing us apart
I've been falling for the day like I'm falling for the night
I've been running from the darkness 'til I'm running from the light
I've been falling for the day like I'm falling for the night
Tryna' make it better but I just can't get it right
No, I just can't get it ohh

The poison of sadness
The breaking of a heart
The echo of madness tearing us apart
Hey, oh, I'm tearing us apart
I've been falling for the day like I'm falling for the night
Tryna' make it better but I just can't get it right

I've been falling for the day like I'm falling for the night
I've been running from the darkness 'til I'm running from the light
I've been falling for the day like I'm falling for the night
Tryna' make it better but I just can't get it right
Oh, no, I just can't get it oooh oh oh oh
