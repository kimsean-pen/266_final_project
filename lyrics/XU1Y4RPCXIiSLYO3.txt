Thank you very much, this song is one of my favorites, it's called Somebody to Love
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet (Take a look at yourself)
Take a look in the mirror and I cry (and cry)
Lord, what you're doing to me? (yeah, yeah)
I've spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord
Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life
I work till I ache in my bones
At the end (at the end of the day) I take home
My hard earned pay all on my own
I go down (down) on my knees (knees) and I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyes, Lord
Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

(He works hard) Everyday (everyday) I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down, they say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Ah they got no common sense, he's got nobody left to believe in
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (Lord)
Somebody (somebody) ooh (somebody)
Anybody find me somebody to love? (Can't anybody find me somebody to love)
I got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing)
I'm altight, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord

(Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody)
Somebody find me, somebody find me somebody to love?
Can anybody find me
Somebody to, c'mon
Love
Yeah
(Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
Find me somebody, somebody, somebody to love (Find me somebody to love)
Find me, find me, find me, find me, find me (Find me somebody to love)
Uh somebody to love (Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
Anybody, anywhere, anybody find me somebody to love (Find me somebody to love)
