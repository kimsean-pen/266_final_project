Having held it
In my open hands
How did it feel then?

Now having felt it
Describe the way the sun hit
A tree you saw when you were ten

I think of everything
When I'm driving not knowing where I'm going
Hearing dogs bark
in your new neighborhood

I think of everything
When I'm driving not knowing where I'm going
Hearing bass boom
in your new neighborhood
