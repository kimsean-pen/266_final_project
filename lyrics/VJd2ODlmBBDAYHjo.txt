Hatred is not in my blood
Euphoria is what I feel in my dreams
Love is what I'm searching for
So take me away
To safer grounds
Where we can run free
Away from harm

I could be looking for you
In all the wrong places
I could me missing on you
With all of this dreaming
I better chase this ghost
Before it leaves me
I can feel your warmth
When my eyes go into hiding

I could be looking for you
In all the wrong places
I could be missing on you
With all of this dreaming

So take me away
To safer grounds
Where we can run free
Away from harm
I can't lose my mind
While wishing for you
I need to keep running
Until I can't see your face in the corner of my brain

I could be looking for you
In all the wrong places
I could me missing on you
With all of this dreaming
I better chase this ghost
Before it leaves me
I can feel your warmth
When my eyes go into hiding

I could be looking for you
In all the wrong places
I could be missing on you
With all of this dreaming

Bleed with me and let's feel it all
Take my youth and make it all yours
Bleed with me and let's feel it all
Take my youth and make it all yours
It's all yours

I could be looking for you
In all the wrong places
I could be missing on you
With all of this dreaming
I better chase this ghost
Before it leaves me
I can feel your warmth
When my eyes go into hiding

I could be looking for you
Iall the wrong places
I could be missing on you
With all of this dreaming

I could be looking for you
(I could be looking for you)
I could be missing on you
(I could be missing on you)
