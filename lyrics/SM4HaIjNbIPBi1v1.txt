No one else can touch me like the way you do
Nothing seems to hurt me when I am close to you
And I hope that we can spend our lives together
I truly wish that this could last forever
For you and me

And when you cry tears keep on falling
I still feel your love for me is true
And when you cry tears keep on falling
I can see that you are feeling blue

For me and you
For me and you

No one else can touch me like the way you do
Nothing seems to hurt me when I am close to you
And I hope that we can spend our lives together
I truly wish that this could last forever
For you and me

And when you cry tears keep on falling
I still feel your love for me is true
And when you cry tears keep on falling
I can see that you are feeling blue
For me and you
For me and you
