(Frankie Vaughn)
The gentle art of conversation is deader than the Dead Sea scrolls.
We've become the weakest kind of nation.
We're uncommunicating souls.
No one talks. No one talks.
It's something we seldom ever do.
No one talks. No one talks.

(Marilyn Monroe)
No one talks but you.

Let's make love.

(Frankie Vaughn)
Here we sit and we chatter.
What are we thinking of?
Let's not make with the patter baby.
Let's make love.

(Marilyn Monroe)
If you roar like a lion,
I could coo like a dove.
If you're sold, begin buying babe.
Let's make love.

(Frankie Vaughn)
Gosh, it's hot.

(Marilyn Monroe)
No, don't turn tv on.
Instead just turn me on.
I light up like neon.
Just a tiny section of your affection in my direction will do. Ooh!

(Frankie Vaughn)
You just love my embraces
Cause they'll fit like a glove.
We'll be off to the races maybe.

(Marilyn Monroe)
Kiss me baby.
Let's make love.
Don't just lay there.
Honey, do something!

Don't just contemplate me.
Prove that you don't hate me.
Come on, osculate me.

(Frankie Vaughn)
Maybe moonlight trips with me
Come to grips with me
Lips to lips with me, do.

You just love my embraces.

(Marilyn Monroe)
Cause they'll fit like a glove.

(Frankie Vaughn)
We could get down to paces maybe.

(Marilyn Monroe)
Kiss me baby.
Let's make love.

(Frankie Vaughn)
My oh my but it's warm here.
I sure wore a tight collar.
Do you know a good doctor?
Let's make love.
