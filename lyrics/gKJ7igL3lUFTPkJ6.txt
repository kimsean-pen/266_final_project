He held his breath to hold your hand
To walk the stair steps in pairs
Climbing up the slippery slope
I'm in love, love I hope

Don't go home, Angelina
Stay with me
Hanging around in the lost and found

Kissed you quick, feeling weird
Lonely lived and disappeared
This is such a simple place
Passing time can't erase

Don't go home, Angelina
Paint tomorrow blue
Day breaks
And every morning when he wakes, he thinks of you

I'm alone, that's okay
I don't mind most of the time
I don't feel afraid to die
She was here, passing by

Don't go home, Angelina
Stay with me
Hanging around in the lost and found
Stay with me, hanging around in the lost and found
