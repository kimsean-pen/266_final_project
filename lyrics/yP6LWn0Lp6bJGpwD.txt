Live and sigh
Crying eyes
Your touch, your heart, your warmth
Lullaby
Live to dream
Dont it seem
The tears, the pain
Reality

Dont you know
These dreams I wish could be
The real you and me
I come running back to you
You push me away
You push, you push me away

Darken days
Go away
The nights are bright
Dream and stay
As I dream loving you
Your touch, your heart, your warmth
Please come true

Dont you know
These dreams I wish could be
The real you and me
I come running back to you
You push me away
You push, you push me away

Dont you know
These dreams I wish could be
The real you and me
I come running back to you
You push me away
You push, you push me away

I come running back to you
You push me away
You push, you push me away

I come running back to you
You push me away
Push me away
Dont you know
You push me away
Running back to you
