Pushing me away because you feel that I'm all the same
Nothing that I do ever seems to make a change
Pushing me away because you feel that I'm all the same
Pushing me away because you're pushing me away
It's early and bright out
The sun swallowed me
I'm glad that you're here with me
This is where I want to be
This is where I want to be
The sun swallowed me
And what about your friends?
What about your friends?
Do they make you happy?
And what about your friends?
What about your friends?
Do they make you happy?
The sun swallowed me
And what about your friends?
What about your friends?
Do they make you happy?
And what about your friends?
What about your friends?
Do they make you happy?
And what about your friends?
What about your friends?
Do they make you happy?
And what about your friends?
What about your friends?
Pull yourself down to get calm
The air in your chest beats the air that you're standing on
Relax yourself man, get calm
I've never seen her so she must be no one
The girl that you found always gone
The air in your chest beats the air that you're standing on
Relax yourself man, get calm
I've never seen her
