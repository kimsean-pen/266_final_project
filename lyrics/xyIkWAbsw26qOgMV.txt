There's something in your eyes
Is everything alright
You look up to the sky
You long for something more, darling
Give me your right hand
I think I understand
Follow me and you will never have to wish again

I know that after tonight
You don't have to look up at the stars No no no no
I know by the end of tonight
You don't have to look about the stars
And I know that if the love is alright
You don't have to look up at the stars No no no no
I know by the end of the tonight you wont have to look up at the stars

Tell me how you feel
And if I'm getting near
I'll tell you where to steer
You tell me where to steer, da-da-da-darling
Way above the clouds
And high above the stars
Through the unknown black holes
No one knows where we are
But we'll return to earth and do it all over again

'Cause I know that after tonight
You don't have to look up at the stars No no no no
I know by the end of tonight

You don't have to look up at the stars
And I know that if the love is alright
You don't have to look up at the stars No no no no
I know by the end of the tonight you wont have to look up at the stars

Come away with me
Come fly away with me
Just for one night no one will ever know, darling
I will leave you satisfied
Forever past time
You don't have to hide
You're free to fly

I know that after tonight
You don't have to look up at the stars, no no no no
I know by the end of tonight
You don't have to look up at the stars
And I know that if the love is alright
You don't have to look up at the stars No no no no
I know by the end of the tonight
you don't have to look up at the stars
I know that after tonight
You don't have to look up at the stars No no no no
I know by the end of tonight
You don't have to look up at the stars
And I know that if the love is alright
You don't have to look up at the stars No no no no
I know by the end of tonight we'll
be looking down from a corner of heaven
