I'm so far down you can't even hurt me now
I've learned to see with my eyes shut
I heard a bird sing the saddest melody
About a paramount love, gone with the wind

Well I hope time heals everything
Cause I need a miracle, not just anything

What would life be without misery?
It would grow too bright,
Oh, light would blind us all
Every moment is a lesson to be learned
So hold your head up high

Well I hope time heals everything
Cause I need a miracle, not just anything

You keep punishing me, while I'm trying to move on
But honey you're not worth it
You've been in too many songs

You keep punishing me, while I'm trying to move on
But honey you're not worth it
You've been in too many songs
