She work it girl, she work the pole
She break it down, she take it low
She's fine as hell, she's about the dough
Doin' her thing right on the floor

And money money she's makin'
Look at the way she's shakin'
Make you wanna touch her, wanna taste her
Have you lustin' for her
Goin' crazy, face it

She's so much more than you're used to
Knows just how to move, seduce you
She gon' do the right thing, touch the right spot
Dance in your lap 'til you're ready to pop

She always ready
When you want it she want it
Like a nympho, the info
Show you where to meet her

On the late night 'til daylight
The club jumpin' if you want a good time
She gon' give you what you want

Baby, it's a new age
You're like my new craze
Let's get together
Maybe we can start a new phase

This smoke's got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here?
You got me sayin'

Ayo, I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me
Ayo, I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me

In a fantasy, it's plain to see
Just how we be, you and me
Back strokin', sweat soakin'
All into my sex sheets

When she ready to ride, I'll be ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch 'til the club close
What should I do on all fours
Now that that shit should be against the law

Different style, different move
Damn, I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinkin' 'bout
All the things I'd do to you
Let's get it poppin' shorty
We can switch positions
From the couch to the counters of my kitchen
Baby, it's a new age
You're like my new craze
Let's get together
Maybe we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here
You got me sayin'
Ayo, I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me
Ayo, I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me
Ooh, she wants it, ooh, she wants it
Mmm, she wants it, I gotta give it to her
She wants it, mmm, she wants it
Mmm, she wants it, I gotta give it to her
I gotta give it to her
Baby, it's a new age
You're like my new craze
Let's get together
Maybe we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here
You got me sayin'
Ayo, I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me
Ayo, I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me
