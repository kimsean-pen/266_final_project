A pre-dawn song
To open up the ground
We found the sound
Now give me a song

I could love you more
I could love you more

It's not about being pretty
It ain't about being perfect
It's that little piece of matter
The tough-hided being

I could love you more
I could love you more

Make me song
Make me a sound
Vibrate, resonate

It takes the ear to hear the waves
And the heart to know your fears, so fear it
There's no hiding here

I could love you more
I could love you more

A song to see what he's saying
Do you see what I'm saying?
If there's no seeing of the saying
You're missing the something

I could love you more
I could love you more

It's not about three songs fast
Or two medium ones
It's about the sun's atmosphere
It's about sonic boom

I could love you more
I could love you more

Make me song
Make me a sound
Vibrate, resonate

It takes the ear
To hear the waves
And the heart to know your fears, so fear it
There's no hiding here

I could love you more
I could love you more

Two hundred and fifty-three octaves below Middle C
There's a B-flat where a wave every year

I could love you more
I could love you more

Let us dance up that water
Let us have ears to hear
A song to agree with
A song to cheer

I could love you more
I could love you more

Make me song
Make me a sound

Make me song
Make me a sound

Vibrate, resonate
Make me song
Make me a sound

Vibrate, resonate
Make me song
Make me a sound
