Drag me to the grave!

Feel the blade of a broken promise
Carvin' wounds in a waste of conscience
I alone have the will to fight it
Save my own demise!

Another victim, another viper
I can feel sins grippin' tighter
To the spirits that we die for
And I will never let it go

Risin' up, I'm a fighter
Young and loud with desire
Heroes blessed by the fire
I won't let these demons

Drag me to the grave
Drag me to the grave!

Death is not from the depths of solace
Takin' life I have made so honest
I'm the world tearin' through this calm
Let's live another night

Feel the seasons changin' faster
Feel the reapers of disaster
And the spirits that we die for
And I will never let it go!

Risin' up, I'm a fighter
Young and loud with desire
Heroes blessed by the fire
Now I live just to conquer

All the pain around us creepin' forward
Reachin' out to

Drag me to the grave
Drag me to the grave!

Risin' up, I'm a fighter
Young and loud with desire
Heroes blessed by the fire
I won't let these demons

Risin' up, I'm a fighter
Young and loud with desire
Heroes blessed by the fire
I won't let these demons
Drag me to the grave

Drag me to the grave!
Drag me to the grave
Drag me to the grave!
