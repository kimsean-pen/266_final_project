Wanna feel what I touch
Wanna find what was lost
Wanna be kind

As you see every curse
And in a dream it'll work
Now you'll feel tied

Wanna praise with this life
And conceal without lies
I just need time

Wanna fight every need
Every push every string
Will you stand by?

I've been awake through the wrong decisions
I've held the ground now I'm gaining soul
I bit my tongue through the cold realisations
I've been accused but I've only begun

Wanna speak what I've seen
Wanna reach what I've dreamed
Wanna be kind

Wanna seal what I've cut
Wanna hear without rush
Wanna ease time

With your hand on your loss
Our scene truly cost
No one told you

And we grew from the day
Into night I'm ashamed
I will join you

I've been awake through the wrong decisions
I've held my ground now I'm gaining soul
I bit my tongue through the cold realisations
I've been accused, but I've only begun
Take me on, take me on
I've been awake, shaking to a rage
I've been awake, shaking to a rage

In the end only once
All you need is a touch
Wanna see love

Every thought you'll be shown
Every act will be known
I defend you

We'll awake every sound
Every chance I'll be found
I'll be with you

To the end now you come
Show your hands to the ones
To behold you

I've been awake through the wrong decisions
I've held my ground now I'm gaining soul
I've held my tongue through the cold realisations
I've been accused, but I've only begun
Take me on, take me on
I've been awake, shaking to a rage
(Take me on, take me on)
I've been awake, shaking to a rage
