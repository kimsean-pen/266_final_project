It took two days
For me to figure out
This isn't working out
But I lost my way
I drove all night
Just to be with you
But you weren't worth the view
I've gotta hit the breaks
Now you know
Get up and go

Arizona Arizona
A car wreck on the highway
Now you're burning by the side of the road
Arizona Arizona's
A million miles from Florida
Now your history
I'm stranded, get me out, I'm going home

Deep in your soul
Lies a lonely heart
That only ever pumps
For you alone
And I can't relate
So I gotta leave you here
I can breathe without you, dear
Just start walking away
Now you know
Get up and go

Arizona Arizona
A car wreck on the highway
Now you're burning by the side of the road
Arizona Arizona's
A million miles from Florida
Now your history
I'm stranded, get me out, I'm going home

Tell me
How does that feel
With a grand canyon
Between me and you
Tell me
How does that feel
To see me waving goodbye

It took two days
For me to figure out
This isn't working out
I've gotta hit the breaks

Arizona Arizona
A car wreck on the highway
Now you're burning by the side of the road
Arizona Arizona's
A million miles from Florida
Now your history
I'm stranded, get me out, I'm going home

Arizona Arizona
A car wreck on the highway
Now you're burning by the side of the road
Arizona Arizona's
A million miles from Florida
Now your history
I'm stranded, get me out, I'm going home
