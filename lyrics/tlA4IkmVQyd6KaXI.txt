Crane

Spring is past - winter's coming on.
Summer's dead - winter's coming on.
All of my hopes for the future now are gone.
All of my battle's are lost, for time has won.
Where is hope - winter's coming on.
Here is fear - winter's coming on.
Look in the mirror and all I see is time.
Stare at the remnant of life that once was mine.
Killed by time.
What is the point of going on?
What is the point of going on?
And on, and on, and on?
Spring is past - winter's coming on.
Summer's dead - winter's coming on.
Look in the mirror and all I see is time.
Stare at the remnant of life that once was mine.
Killed by time.
What is the point of going on?
What is the point of going on?
And on, and on, and on, and on.
What is the point of going on?
What is the point of going on?
And on, and on, and on?
