They call me useless, careless, nobody ought to miss
With the thing they don't understand
They call me hopeless, heartless, there's no way out of this
When it's so far outta your hand
I confess there's a hole in my chest
From the things that I did
And the gun in my hand
I won't rest till it's all done and said
And I get what I give

I'm a pain dealer, I'm a faith healer
I'm a soul stealer, and I'm coming for you
I'm a dream breaker, I'm a truth maker
I'm a cold-blooded killer and I'm coming for you
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And there's nothing you can do
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm coming for you

They call me freedom, fallen
Don't you hear me calling
I'm the voice in the back of your head
With a whisper, I'm there, over your shoulder
Don't you wish you never let me in
I confess that the devil's my kin
I'm a brother to sin, since I don't know when
I won't rest till it's all done and said
And I get what I give

I'm a pain dealer, I'm a faith healer
I'm a soul stealer, and I'm coming for you
I'm a dream breaker, I'm a truth maker
I'm a cold-blooded killer and I'm coming for you
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And there's nothing you can do
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm coming for you

Yeah
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah!
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah
Ooh, I say
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah

I'm a pain dealer, I'm a faith healer
I'm a soul stealer, and I'm coming for you
I'm a dream breaker, I'm a truth maker
I'm a coldblooded killer and I'm coming for you
