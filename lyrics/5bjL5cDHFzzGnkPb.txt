Woke up screaming in bed
This silence taunts me
Its like I'm there again
But this nightmare calms me down
The fire licks my skin
I feel it burn away
Bullets stream overhead
My heart beats deafening
I've never been so afraid

But we were men
We walk the front lines
We defend our country with our lives
We pretend to see truth in all these lies
Cause in the end we were men

I close my eyes to hide their faces haunt me
My faith is hard to find
Your picture calms me down
I can't cope with the pain
These pills don't work
They just leave me the same
I feel so weak today

You made me strong
So why did you take it away?
I'm trapped inside the affray

But we were men
We walk the front lines
We defend our country with our lives
We pretend to see truth in all these lies
Cause in the end we were,

Soldiers don't feel
They do what they're told
You send them to war
But, They never go home
You feed on their bones
Live on through their names
And Pray for their souls
That god can't save

We live to fight another day
And serve our country without dismay
And those who take us from our homes
may god have mercy on their souls

But we were men
We walk the front lines
We defend our country with our lives
We pretend to see truth in all these lies
Cause in the end we were men
We were men
