Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Kat Deluna
And Akon
Yeah, oh, Konvict
I see you dancin' with every girl

Lookin' for someone to rock your world
I'm checkin' your body, it's lookin' right
Boy I can tell that you go all night

Sweet boy, I just wanna be your fantasy boy
If you want it boy you gotta push push baby
Don't stop for a minute
Oh oh, oh oh, ooh oh oh, oh oh oh
I said push push baby

Take it to the limit
Oh oh, oh oh, ooh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Push it baby just the way I like (you know I want it)

Pick me up and take me for a ride (you know I want it)
Sexy body don't you wanna turn me out (you know I want it)
When I hop into it, take me to the crowd
Oh oh oh ohh

Sweet boy, I just wanna be your fantasy boy
If you want it boy you gotta push push baby
Don't stop for a minute
Oh oh, oh oh, ooh oh oh, oh oh oh
I said push push baby
Take it to the limit
Oh oh, oh oh, ooh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

I like the one lottery which I'm 'bout to go get my claim on
Dam, you look like a perfect picture 'bout to go get my frame on
Lookin' like the type I've been searchin' for to put my last name on
Come on closer with yo umbrella cause you're 'bout to get rained on

Clap it up baby keep on clapping
Back it up by the way you're stacking
Kat Deluna is now the captain and Akon wanna know what's cracking

Push push baby
Don't stop for a minute
Oh oh, oh oh, ooh oh oh, oh oh
I said push push baby
Take it to the limit
Ooh oh, oh oh, ooh oh oh, oh oh
Push push baby
Don't stop for a minute
Oh oh, oh oh, ooh oh oh, oh oh
I said push push baby
Take it to the limit
Ooh oh, oh oh, ooh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
