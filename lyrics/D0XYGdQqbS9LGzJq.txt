It was cold, you hid your hands inside your sleeve
And as walked I heard the laughter in the leaves
See the shadows lying now where once we stood
And I would lie down with them if I only could

The music came to me, it came across the sound
How you laughed and shone and danced a circle 'round
As we walked away I saw a shadow on the ground
There were stones inside my pockets that we found

When I was younger I heard angels on the roof
A thousand voices singing, each note was the truth
All the wise and light I have left them in my youth
And I have only just my memory for proof

I see a doorway open on a darkened room
While in the garden thread lies broken on the loom
I see your face it's smiling, flicker on the wall
And in the distance mountains waiting for the fall

See these knots around my hands, around my feet
They would take me down my end for me to meet
I grow weary of this struggle and this fight
Morning so far off from out here in the night

The night is cold and you must leave me this I know
And empty all the places where we used to go
Before I knew you I went climbing in the snow
Called your name out to the darkness down below

I miss you
