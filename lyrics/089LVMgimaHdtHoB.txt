I realize, realize
I get a little bit wild sometimes
And I know, I am numb to what we have become, sometimes
So slip away with me, stay with me
Everything's okay, with me, right
Don't have to run, have to run
We can walk in the sun one last time

And it feels, yeah it feels so good
When you're here
We are here to love

People come, people go
But I'd like to get to know you now
What is wrong with me, wrong with me
Want you to belong to me now
So find a way with me, stay with me
I will start behaving right
And I don't have anything to tie me down tonight

And it feels, yeah it feels so good
When you're here
We are here to love
Not giving up, no
If it feels so good
When you're here, so close
We are here to love

And I can't slow down
And I need you now

And it feels, yeah it feels so good
When you're here
We are here to love
Not giving up, no
Cause it feels so good
When you're here, so close
We are here to love
