I returned a bag of groceries
accidently taken off the shelf
before the expiration date
I came back as a bag of groceries
accidently taken off the shelf
before the date stamped on myself
Did a large procession wave their (did a)
torches as my head fell in the basket, (large pro-)
and was everybody dancing on the casket? (cession dance?)
Now it's over I'm dead and I haven't
done anything that I want (now it's over)
or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do
I will never say the word
"procrastinate" again; I'll never
see myself in the mirror with my eyes closed
I didn't apologize for
when I was eight and I made my younger brother
have to be my personal slave
Did a large procession wave their (did a)
torches as my head fell in the basket, (large pro-)
and was everybody dancing on the casket? (cession dance?)
Now it's over I'm dead and I haven't
done anything that I want (now it's over)
or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do
(so) so I won't
(sit) sit at home
(and) anymore
(and) and you won't
(and) see my head in
(and) the window
(and) and I won't
(and) be around
(and) ever anymore
(and) and I'll be up there on the wall at the store
