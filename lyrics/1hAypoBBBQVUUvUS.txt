Thunder woke me up, it was storming in the city
I was suddenly wide awake
Sitting in the darkness but my eyes they hadn't adjusted
I was on my own, on my own
I still find it scary
Lightning short could start a fire
brick and motor? might not survive
Would you start to miss me, would you start to miss me
Or am I all alone?
No, I'm just a narcissist

Too blessed to be depressed, thank Jesus
God I'm venting over
Love me
I'll let you take my sins out on me
I'll be your ever after, honey
