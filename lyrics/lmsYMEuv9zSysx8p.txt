Oh, he treats me with respect, he says he loves me all the time
He calls me fifteen times a day, he likes to make sure that I'm fine
You know I've never met a man who's made me feel quite so secure
He's not like all them other boys, they're all so dumb and immature

There's just one thing that's getting in the way
When we go up to bed, you're just no good, it's such a shame
And I look into your eyes, I want to get to know you
And then you make this noise, and it's apparent it's all over

It's not fair and I think you're really mean
I think you're really mean, I think you're really mean
Oh, you're supposed to care, but you never make me scream
You never make me scream

Oh, it's not fair and it's really not ok
It's really not ok, it's really not ok
Oh, you're supposed to care
But all you do is take, yeah, all you do is take

Oh, I lie here in the wet patch, in the middle of the bed
I'm feeling pretty damn hard done by, I spent ages givin' head
Then I remember all the nice things that you've ever said to me
Maybe I'm just overreacting, maybe you're the one for me

There's just one thing that's getting in the way
When we go up to bed, you're just no good, it's such a shame
And I look into your eyes, I want to get to know you
And then you make this noise, and it's apparent it's all over

It's not fair and I think you're really mean
I think you're really mean, I think you're really mean
Oh, you're supposed to care, but you never make me scream
You never make me scream

Oh, it's not fair and it's really not ok
It's really not ok, it's really not ok
Oh, you're supposed to care, but all you do is take

There's just one thing that's getting in the way
When we go up to bed, you're just no good, it's such a shame
And I look into your eyes, I want to get to know you
And then you make this noise, and it's apparent it's all over

It's not fair and I think you're really mean
I think you're really mean, I think you're really mean
Oh, you're supposed to care, but you never make me scream
You never make me scream

Oh, it's not fair and it's really not ok
It's really not ok, it's really not ok
Oh, you're supposed to care, but all you do is take
