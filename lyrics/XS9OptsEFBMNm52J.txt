Oh my girl.
please stay strong.
please fight hard for me.
right then wrong.
begging you please to remember.
that the skies can open wide.
reveal a truth from which we can't hide.
it won't lie to you.
lie to you.
my sweet girl.
please stay sane.
please stay brave for me.
wax then wane.
hang on with me until december.
when the skies will open wide.
reveal a course to which we'll abide.
no goodbye from you.
goodbye from you.
now our eyes are open wide.
to reveal the truth that is you and i.
never lie to you.
lie to you.
my sweet little girl.
every time that you cry.
strips my soul away.
my sweet little girl.
every time you don't try.
my insides die.
and the skies will open wide.
reveal a truth from which we can't hide.
it won't lie to you.
lie to you.
now our eyes are open wide.
to embrace the truth that is you and i.
no goodbye from you.
goodbye from you
