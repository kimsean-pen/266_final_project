It's a sin, my darling how I love you
Because I know our love can never be
It's a sin to keep this memory of you
When silence proves that you've forgotten me
The dream I built for us has tumbled
Each promise broken like my heart
It's a sin, my darling how I love you
So much in love and yet so far apart

It's a sin to hide behind this heartache
To make believe that I've found someone new
It's a sin to say that I don't miss you
When people know I'm still in love with you
I'm sure you're happy with another
Who shares the love I couldn't win
Why pretend that I can't live without you
When deep inside I know that it's a sin
