We're the ship without a storm
The cold without the warm
Light inside the darkness
That it needs, yeah

We're a laugh without tear
The hope without the fear
We are coming, home

We're off to the witch
We may never, never, never, come home
But the magic that we'll feel
Is worth the lifetime

We're all born upon the cross
We're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself
But the only way is down

We don't come alone
We are fire, we are stone
We're the hand that writes
Then quickly moves away

We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, yeah
We're the last in line

Two eyes from the east
It's the angel or the beast
And the answer lies
Between the good and bad

We search for the truth
We could die upon the tooth
But the thrill of just the chase
Is worth the pain

We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, yeah
We're the last in line, oh

Yeah, we're off to the witch
We may never, never, never come home
But the magic that we'll feel
It worth a lifetime

We're all born upon the cross
You know we're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself
But the only way to go is down

We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, oh
