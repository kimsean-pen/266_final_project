I smell something in the air, you know it smells like barbecue
if i had some i wouldn't care because i like barbecue

well, i like barbecue
you like barbecue
we like barbecue
you know i sure like barbecue

sister's out back sittin' in the swing, she wants some barbecue
little brother's on the porch doin'
handsprings, singin' i'd like some barbecue

my old dog has got a bone, and he wants some barbecue
i've got an old gray cat sittin' on
the stone, and he's beggin' for barbecue

here comes pop from up the street and he's got some barbecue
all the kids are startin' to pat
their feet because they want some barbecue
