Julie's on the run so far away from home
Mesmerized by promises and gold
Took the wrong left, turn, it's just a one way street
Now she's all alone, out in the cold

Yes it's true we've heard it all before
But little Julie laughs no more

Laughs no more

Julie's now on her way to grandma's house
A tiny little cottage in the woods
Hunting wolves are chasing this delicious mouse
Where she went we never understood

Nothing really matters anymore
No Julie longer knocks on the door
A fallen princess bends her head in shame
In the end there's no one else to blame

And she's falling
Falling without reach
Julie's falling,
A little girl lost in her dreams
Afraid to go, afraid to live
Into the emptiness what there's to believe

Julie's on the bean stalk way up in the clouds
Can't stop climbing, refuses to look down
The giant in his castle, laughs gives wondrous wows
She's cast into the stew without a sound

Nothing really matters anymore
No Julie longer knocks on the door
A fallen princess bends her head in shame
In the end there's no one else to blame
