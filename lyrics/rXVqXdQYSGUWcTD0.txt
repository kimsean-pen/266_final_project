Face all the rapid pulsed captives
Inject them poison for mass consumption
Avoid litigation by torturing sets

All deleted sets
Erase their eyes
Leave them eyeless

Sets Break it open

Insidious liquid courses through veins
Visionary field collapses
Blackness engulfs the sound of silence
Blind to the horrors around
Eternity lasts forever

Look into its eyeless crying
Touch its death mask
Leave them all alone inside this holocaust
Leave them eyeless
Sets break it open
