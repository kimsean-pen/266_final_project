I got three women
Red, blonde and brunette
I got three women
Red, blonde and brunette
It took a digital photograph
To pick which one I like

I'm lonely at night
But I stay up until the break of day
Yeah, I'm lonely at night
But I stay up until the break of day
How come I gotta have a woman
To blow these blues away

Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy lordy lordy Lord

I got one in California
And one back in Detroit
I got one in California
And one back in Detroit
But my woman in Nashville
Cashes the bottle with her daddy
All night

Well, she hauled my ashes
But she took 'em too far away
Yeah, she hauled my ashes
But she took 'em too far away
She says she loves her daddy
But only when he's got bills to pay

Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy lordy lordy Lord

Well, I wish I could tell you
Just what my three women do
Yeah, I wish I could tell you
Just what my three women do
But if I open my mouth
Well, that'll be three women
That I lose

Now I know what you're thinking
What gives me the right?
Yeah I know what you're thinking
But what gives YOU the right?
Well these women must be getting something
'Cause they come and see me
Every night

Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy lordy lordy Lord
