You've changed
The sparkle in your eyes is gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart
You've changed

You've changed
Your kisses now are so blas√©
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand
You've changed

You've forgotten the words I love you
And the memories that we've shared
You've ignored all the stars up above you
I can't realize that you ever cared
You've changed

You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me, I know we're through
It's all over now
You've changed

You've forgotten the words I love you
And the memories that we've shared
You ignore all the stars up above you
I can't realize that you ever cared
You've changed

You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me, I know we're through
It's all over now
You've changed
