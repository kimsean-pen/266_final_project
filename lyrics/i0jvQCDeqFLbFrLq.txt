Ooh-ooh-ooh (hey!)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (hey!)
Not a soul up ahead and nothing behind
There's a desert in my blood and a storm in your eyes
Am I the king of nothing at all?
And you're the queen of nothing at all

But I remember the fight and I forget the pain
I got my hand in your pocket and my key in your chain
Am I the king of nothing at all?
And you're the queen of nothing at all

Oh, through the wilderness
You and I we're walking through the emptiness
Oh, and my heart is a mess
Is it the only defense against the wilderness?

Well, cross my heart and hope to die
Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine
Oh, one foot in front of the other
Ooh-ooh-ooh (hey!)
One foot in front of the other
Ooh-ooh-ooh (hey!)
One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other
Ooh, all that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other

Not a soul on the road
Not a star in the sky
It's a desert in my heart
And I know where to hide
I'm your king of nothing at all
And you're my queen of nothing at all

Well out here in the dust
If you don't have trust
Ain't nothing left of us
This is the exodus
They're just testing us
They can't flex with us
They can't mess with us
They can't mess with us

Oh, through the wilderness
How come even together
There can be loneliness?
Oh, our hearts' a mess
But it's our only defense
To brave the wilderness

Well, cross my heart and hope to die
Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine
Oh, one foot in front of the other
Ooh-ooh-ooh (hey!)
One foot in front of the other
Ooh-ooh-ooh (hey!)
One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other
Ooh, all that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other

(Well, out here in the dust)

Oh, through the wilderness
How come even together
There can be loneliness?
Oh, our hearts' a mess
But it's our only defense
To brave the wilderness

Cross my heart and hope to die
Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine
Oh, one foot in front of the other
Ooh-ooh-ooh (hey!)
One foot in front of the other
Ooh-ooh-ooh (hey!)
One foot in front of the other (hey!)
(In the wilderness)
One foot in front of the other (hey!)
Ooh, all that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other

Oh, in the so-called 'Land of the Free'
One foot in front of the other
Don't you know that all we have is each other?
One foot in front of the other
