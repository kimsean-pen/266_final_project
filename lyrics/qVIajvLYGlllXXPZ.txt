When I was younger, I always thought
I could be someone if I tried enough
When I was younger, my father said
Wear a smile, show respect
When I was younger, you never said
When I was older, I'd feel helpless
When I was younger, you shone the light
And now that I'm older, it doesn't shine bright
When I was younger, you always said
That as I got older, you'd always be there

I'm singin' ooohhh, I'm singin' ooohhh
I'm singin' ooohhh, I'm singin' ooohhh

When I was younger, I used to care
About everything that my father said
When I was younger, you even told me
Just show evil, the upmost respect
When I was younger, I never thought
That when I was older, I'd see you give up
Now that I'm older, I carry the torch
Just promise you'll stand, you'll be strong

I'm singin' ooohhh, I'm singin' ooohhh
I'm singin' ooohhh, I'm singin' ooohhh
I'm singin' ooohhh, I'm singin' ooohhh
I'm singin' ooohhh, I'm singin' ooohhh

When I was younger, I never thought
When I was younger, I never thought
When I was older, I'd find new us (?)
When I was older, I'd find new us (?)
I'd do it for you, I'd do it for you
I'd do it for you, I'd do it for you

When I was younger, I only dreamed
That when I got older, you'd be proud of me
When I was younger, I promised you both
That when I was older, you'd be proud of me
