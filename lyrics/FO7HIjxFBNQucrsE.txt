You know it's all on your mind
So get on up until you dance
Try it out
There ain't nothing you can lose
So don't hesitate no more
Try it out
Don't make your mind
On what they say
You'll never know until you do
Try it out
Take a chance
You can do it
Try it out
Don't feel sorry for yourself
You can make it
You can break it
Try it out
Never heard it
It's what they say
That's the game you have to play
Try it out
Take the time, take a chance
Every minute, every day
Try it out
So come on, come on
Try it out
