I got to stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you

I got to stay
I got to stay
I got to stay

I got to stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you

I got to stay

Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Standing in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I got to stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind
High all the time to keep you off my mind
I got to stay
I got to stay.
