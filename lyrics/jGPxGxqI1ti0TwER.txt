CAN YOU PROVE TO ME
THAT YOU'RE NOT DEAD AND GONE
WE CRAWLED ON HANDS AND KNEES
BUT NOW I LIVE MY LIFE STANDING STRONG
CAN YOU PROVE TO ME
THAT YOU'RE NOT DEAD AND GONE
WE CRAWLED ON HANDS AND KNEES
BUT NOW I LIVE MY LIFE STANDING STRONG

Alone with the living dead
You had to know, I didn't go
And walk off the edge with you and your friends
And if you try to play it off again
Then it's over and out
You better keep your mouth shut
No, just let it go
I built myself up undercover
But not for long

What does it take to save you
Everything you've got to bring me back down
There's nothing left to save
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
For me to give you
Everything you've got just brings you back down
There's nothing left to save
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT

Push back the clock
Back to when it was new to us
And knew we were true from the start
To win your heart
To keep our connection in the void
Of dissection of our words
We heard a common collection
For those who knew what it was to survive
We will strive to fill the void
Build up all the walls that have been destroyed
We've gotten a bad name
For taking all the blame
It's just another game for you

What does it take to save you
Everything you've got to bring me back down
There's nothing left to save
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
For me to give you
Everything you've got just brings you back down
There's nothing left to save
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT

Try to find a way
We're gonna find a way to erase all our mistakes
We built this, we built this
We built this city on heart and soul
Strive to fill the void
Build up all the walls that have been destroyed
We've gotten a bad name
For taking all the blame
It's just another game for you

What does it take to save you
Everything you've got to bring me back down
There's nothing left to save
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
For me to give you
Everything you've got just brings you back down
There's nothing left to save
There's nothing left to save

CAN YOU PROVE TO ME
THAT YOU'RE NOT DEAD AND GONE
WE CRAWLED ON HANDS AND KNEES
BUT NOW I LIVE MY LIFE STANDING STRONG
CAN YOU PROVE TO ME
THAT YOU'RE NOT DEAD AND GONE
WE CRAWLED ON HANDS AND KNEES
BUT NOW I LIVE MY LIFE STANDING STRONG
WE BUILT THIS, WE BUILT THIS
WE BUILT THIS CITY ON HEART AND SOUL
CREATE IT
DESTROY IT
WE BUILT IT WITH HEART AND SOUL
