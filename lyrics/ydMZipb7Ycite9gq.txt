When I don't want to forget
where I come from,
I think of your moose your class
And I'm back home.
I've got your rythm in my blood,
Your crazy touch in my soul,
My memory's out of control.

I can't get you out of my mind...
Come back to, come back to dance
With me.
Come back to, come back to dance
With me.

Your feet on the dancefloor had
nothing to prove,
You have your own be bop style
and your groove.
Because I grew up on your knees
when start the music is a glee,
Nobody ever stops me.

I can't get you out of my mind...
Come back to, come back to dance
With me.
Come back to, come back to dance
With me.
Come back to, come back to dance
With me.
Come back to, come back to dance
With me.

I can't get you out of my mind...

Come back to, come back to dance
With me.
Come back to, come back to dance
With me.
