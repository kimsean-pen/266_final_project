Always creeps are stalking
In windows they'll be watching
Whether we are rotting
The ocean still lays
The gods still pay

They'll be sifting though our dead remains
From the pain we stay
Above but
Don't float away
My sad remains
Don't you change
We change
Why

Please rest my ways
I'll take your pain
With my sad bones and my soiled throne
Crush them up
Bones dust
We are only just
Blue blood rust

Blue blood forest trail
Sifting thru lite in the pine needle
My sacred friend
You came
Just for in time for the end
