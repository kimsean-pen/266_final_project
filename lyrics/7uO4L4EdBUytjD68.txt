It's a wonder to see you here
Any sign of light you disappear
Blood kept, been back on the prowl
From dusk until the morning howls

Toughest break, it's harsh
Early [?] and cruel
And I can't tell where you're from
But I know what you're going through

No one dares to ask where you've been
Feared of what you might tell them
No one dares to ask where you've been
They can only dream

Walking at midnight, midnight
Sink into the evening tide
Walking at midnight, midnight
Let the nighttime be a disguise

Sun down and you slink off
The devil's work, it can be tough
But who am I to judge?
Everybody has something they can't shake off

No one asks where you've been
Feared of what you might tell them
No one dares to ask where you've been
They can only dream

Walking at midnight, midnight
Sink into the evening tide
Walking at midnight, midnight
Let the nighttime be a disguise

Walking at midnight, midnight
Sink into the evening tide
Walking at midnight, midnight
Let the nighttime be a disguise

Let the moon light up our playground
The stars will be the jewels in your crown
Our velvet sky will keep us warm now
Until dawn breaks the bow

Walking at midnight, midnight
Sink into the evening tide
Walking at midnight, midnight
Let the nighttime be a disguise

Walking at midnight, midnight
Sink into the evening tide
Walking at midnight, midnight
Let the nighttime be a disguise
