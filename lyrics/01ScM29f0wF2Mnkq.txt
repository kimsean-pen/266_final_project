I know you're not a liar
And I know you could set fire
This day
Go ahead and make me look away
Strike me down
I am calling your lightning
Down from your dark hiding place
Go ahead and show me
Your face

Reign down
And destroy me
Reign down
And destroy me
Reign down

I mean no disrespect
I am simply very perplexed by your ways
Why won't you let us use your name?

Reign down
And destroy me
Reign down
And destroy me
Reign down
And destroy me
Reign down
And destroy me

Reign down
Reign down
