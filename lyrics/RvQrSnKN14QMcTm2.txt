I was looking for the main line
And I was workin' through a friend of mine
But I couldn't seem to find the time
What do they know about love
What do they know about love
What do they know about love, my friend
What do they know about love
The jingle of a dog's collar would be good right here
The jingle of a dog's collar would be fine
The jingle of a dog's collar would be good right here
The jingle of a dog's collar would be fine

What do they know about love
What do they know about love
What do they know about love, my friend
What do they know about love
The jingle of a dog's collar would be good right here
The jingle of a dog's collar would be fine
The jingle of a dog's collar would be good right here
The jingle of a dog's collar would be fine
I was looking for the main line
And I was working for a friend of mine
What do they know about love
What do they know about love
