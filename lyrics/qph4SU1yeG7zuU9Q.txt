Oh, oh

For you, I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin
It's time to sink or swim
Watch them play for ya
For you, I'd be, oh oh
Running a thousand miles
Just to get to where you are

Step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot
But for I admit I
I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one
Giving you all this attention
Baby listen

I just need somebody to love
I, I don't need too much
Just somebody to love

Somebody to love
I don't need anything else
I promise, girl, I swear

I, I need somebody

Every day
I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds
Smile for me
I would take
Every seconds, every single time
Spend it like my last dime

Step to the beat of my hear
I don't need a whole lot
But for you I admit I
I rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one
Givin' you all this attention
Baby listen
