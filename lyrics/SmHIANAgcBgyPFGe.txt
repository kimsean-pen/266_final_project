Day is his name
His legs of oaken trunks
His arms of oaken branches
Flames of sun his hair
He stands on the shore
His speech is the wind
The stormy roar of the ocean
His song eternal

When the rumbling winds grow quiet
And the roaring waves turn still
A blue shadow cast on the sea
The giant is born again
When the rumbling winds grow quiet
And the roaring waves turn still
A blue shadow on the sea
The giant is born again

Night is her name
Her feet of sarsen stone
Her arms craggy reegs
Shoals of fish her hair
She stands on the shore
Stars on her shoulders
The moon floats on the waves
On her blue forehead

When the rumbling winds grow quiet
And the roaring waves turn still
A blue shadow cast on the sea
The giant is born again
When the rumbling winds grow quiet
And the roaring waves turn still
A blue shadow on the sea
The giant is born again

Roaring waves
Rumbling winds
The giant is born again

When the rumbling winds grow quiet
And the roaring waves turn still
A blue shadow cast on the sea
The giant is born again
When the rumbling winds grow quiet
And the roaring waves turn still
A blue shadow on the sea
The giant is born again

The giant is born again
