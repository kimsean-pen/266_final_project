This time won't blame myself
It's been a long time coming, been a long time coming
This time I know you well
It's been a long time coming, been a long time coming

Follow me they're gonna follow
'Cause I'm on the inside and they're on the outside waiting
This time I know myself
It's been a long time coming, been a long time coming

Don't worry
You don't have to bare your soul about it
Go away, you can't stay
You got no more reasons left to come my way
Go away, you can't stay
You got no more reasons left to come my way

Brain
Robot wang
Gonna slang through the tang
I-8764
The sex assistant
I-8764
It's no commitment

She said
Drink that love, don't demand it
'Cause baby, I can't stand it
When you look so pathetic
But I can't stop with the rhythm of it
Drink that love
It's like a habit
Feeling like a savage
You know I gotta have it
I, I gotta have it all

I wish I didn't miss this
Ah, ah, I gotta have it all
They call me hedonistic
Can't stop with the rhythm, gotta have it all
I make them kiss they sistas
Ah, ah, I gotta have it all
He flips his black ass robot hair

She said
Drink that love, don't demand it
'Cause baby, I can't stand it
When you look so pathetic
But I can't stop with the rhythm of it
Drink that love
It's like a habit
Feeling like a savage
You know I gotta have it
I, I gotta have it all

You're on another planet
You're on another planet

Follow me they're gonna follow
'Cause I'm on the inside and they're on the outside waiting
This time I know myself
It's been a long time coming, been a long time coming
