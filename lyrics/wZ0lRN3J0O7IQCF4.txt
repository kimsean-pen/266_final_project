Half past eight and you're late
Coffee's cold, what a state
They've dragged you down
Fate's got you scraped
Work to death
Can't you turn them words around

Is it really what you want?
Is it really what you need?
Is it really what you choose?
My dear

Is it really what you want?
Is it really what you need?
Is it really what you choose?
Oooh oh!

The world is in your hands
The world is in your hands
The world belongs to those of us
Who still believe we can
And it matters what you do

Though they all look down on you
Cos it's better that you've come from nothing

Than nothing comes from you
Come with us, come with us
Join with us, join with us
Don't make a sound
Count your pennies, count your pounds

There's no way out
What will you do when all love gives up on you
Can't turn around

Is it really what you want?
Is it really what you need?
Is it really what you choose?
The world is in your hands

The world is in your hands
The world belongs to those of us
Who still believe we can
And it matters what you do

Though they all look down on you
Cos it's better that you've come from nothing

Than nothing comes from you
Come with us, come with us

Join with us, join with us
See we've got a place and it's here for you
For all we ever wanted was a different view
I've never knew somebody live with so much pain
If you open your heart come with us and we'll take you away
Come with us, Come with us
Join with us, Join with us
Come with us, Come with us
Join with us, Join with us
