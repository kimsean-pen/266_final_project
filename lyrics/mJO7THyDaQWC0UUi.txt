Don't hold that burden
Leave it all to me
I'll cross the land for
A final plea
So get out of your skin
And talk with me
Part of us will be
Eternal

I'm howling for a chance, baby
I'm begging for a chance, trust me
I'm howling for a chance, trust me

Don't hold that burden
Leave it all to me
I'll cross the land for
A final plea
Part of us will be
Eternal

I'm howling for a chance, baby
I'm begging for a chance, trust me

I wanna strip your soul
I wanna strip your soul
To caress your pretty soul
I wanna strip your soul
God damn I fucking want you
I wanna strip your soul
Me and your brain so alone
I wanna strip your soul
To caress your pretty soul
God damn I fucking want you
I wanna strip your soul
Me and your brain so alone
God damn I fucking love you
