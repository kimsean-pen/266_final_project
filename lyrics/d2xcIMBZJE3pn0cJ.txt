Everybody wanna get some breathe
Load a gun to the world I see
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored

Everybody wanna get some breathe
Load a gun to the world I see
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored

You are not alone
And not the only yours
I want to hear your voice
Let's say ooh

I wanna scream aloud oh more
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored

I wanna scream aloud oh more
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored

I wanna scream aloud oh more

Everybody wanna get some breathe
Load a gun to the world I see
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored

Everybody wanna get some breathe
Load a gun to the world I see
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored

You are not alone
And not the only yours
I want to hear your voice
Let's say ooh

I wanna scream aloud oh more
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored

I wanna scream aloud oh more
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored

I wanna scream aloud oh more

You are not alone
And not the only yours
I want to hear your voice
Let's say ooh

I wanna scream aloud oh more

You are not alone
And not the only yours
I want to hear your voice
Let's say ooh

I wanna scream aloud oh more
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored

I wanna scream aloud oh more
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored

I wanna scream aloud oh more
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored

I wanna scream aloud oh more
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored
I start to get a little bored

I wanna scream aloud oh more
