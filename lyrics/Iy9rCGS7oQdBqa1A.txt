Day breaks and when I turn
You're not on my pillow
My head shakes and then the penny drops
Still your t-shirt on my chair
Pencilled hearts on paper
I try not to think but I can't stop
And doubt sets in like a storm
I could feel it coming
And words echo out yesterday
Time pushed me to the edge
The jump was my decision
I've only got myself to blame

'Cause I have no right to love you
When I chose to walk away
I have no right to miss you
When I didn't wanna stay
And I have no right to need you
And I knew what my heart was gonna lose
I have no right to love you
But I do, I still do
Yeah, I still do

Night falls, I'm wide awake
Wishing I could call you
I'm too used to hearing all about your day
The cold creeps up next to me
Now we don't share these covers
But I've no license to complain

'Cause I have no right to love you
When I chose to walk away
I have no right to miss you
When I didn't wanna stay
And I have no right to need you
And I knew what my heart was gonna lose
I have no right to love you
But I do, I still do

You know I care, but I can't be there
To make this unmade bed of roses
And you deserve to be put first
I had to let you go

'Cause I have no right to love you
When I chose to walk away
I have no right to miss you
When I didn't wanna stay
And I have no right to need you
And I knew what my heart was gonna lose
To ask if you're okay
When I left you so confused
I have no right to love you
I have no right, oh
I have no right to love you
But I still do
Yeah, I still do, woah
I still do
