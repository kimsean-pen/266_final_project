We watched the bands until the stars burn out the morning sky
You dragged me in became the skin that keeps me warm at night
All that you left me was a number, on the back of my hand
I kissed the poison on your lips till I was paralysed
Now all the chemicals are burning right between my eyes
All that you left me was a number, on the back of my hand
I got nothing Woohoo Woohoo
So I've been walking Im gonna find you
Through every backstreet I will run through Ooo
I count the days Ooo till I can bring you home
Your hand in my hand Woohoo Woohoo Hoo
Lets slip away I know a place some where outside of town
I lost your grip out in the rain amongst the raging crowd
And all your numbers started fading, from the back of my hand
I got nothing Woohoo Woohoo
So Ive been walking Im gonna find you
Through every backstreet I will run though Ooo
I count the days ooo till I can bring you home
Your hand in my hand yeah Woohoo Woohoo Hoo
Woohoo Woohoo yeah
Woohoo Woohoo yeah
Woohoo Woohoo yeah
Till I can bring you home
Woohoo Woohoo yeah
Woohoo Woohoo yeah
Woohoo Woohoo yeah
Sill I can bring you home
Soo Ive been walking I'm gonna find you
Through every backstreet I will run through Ooo
I count the days ooo till I can bring you home
Your hand in my hand Woohoo Woohoo Hooo
