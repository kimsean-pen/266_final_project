You arrive, now that I must leave
I'll take one step out of the nice dream
Into, into something unknown, something unkind
Somewhere so quiet, gone from your side
Send me to lie here

Forever unseen
The distance is killing me, killing me
The distance between

I just want to die
I just want to lose you
But no one else can soothe like you would do for me
Soothe some of my doubts, all of my lives
Set them on wires, set them on wire
Send them through black for me

Forever unseen
The distance is killing me, killing me
The distance between

Why, why would you leave here
Right when I need you
No, I can't see you
Out in the open
Out in the darkness
Here where I knew you
Here in my heart
And on somewhere unseen
The distance is killing me
The distance between
I'm taking the water, taking on time
Does it ever leave
Does it ever leave
Taking on the water, taking on time
Does it ever sleep
Does it sleep at all
Does it sleep at all
Does it sleep at all
