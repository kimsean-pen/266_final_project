Out of the fire I found a fire inside
You can see the pain still alive in my eyes
I've loved and I've lost
Through heaven and hell
Turn they back on me too many times to turn back now
My nigga I won't stop, now
I can't, I can't, I can't stop now
I can't, I can't, I can't be stopped now

It wasn't easy but I learned the hard way and let me tell you how
Lived life and learned my lessons
Spent dough and earned my blessings
Southside my tatted necklace
Ball like I'm ambidextrous
Every time they tried to block me
Switched hands and changed directions
Fist in the air like Rocky
Bitch I think my name Sylvester
That's the difference between me and them
When they thought it was the end, I was still tryna see a M
Now the difference 'tween me and them
Even in Mercedes Buick, I was still tryna see a Benz
I was backed into a corner
Sat chasing, catching charges
It's re-election season
Bitch I think I'm back in office
You don't know my pain
How far I've came
Those days are gone
You cursed my name
I prayed to God he shined the sun
He gave me rain
I took that water and walk on it
Marching harder than million Martins
On my darkest days, I'm still a star; I shine regardless

Out of the fire I found a fire inside
You can see the pain still alive in my eyes
I've loved and I've lost
Through heaven and hell
Turn they back on me too many times to turn back now
My nigga I won't stop, now
I can't, I can't, I can't stop now
I can't, I can't, I can't be stopped now

And I thought they said light skin niggas went out of style
André 3k said you only funky as your last cut
So I'm state to state, and I move like a Mac truck
Plus I gotta keep a Mac tucked
For these vid soldier niggas on the 'Gram trying act tough
Y'all too alternative get your facts up, I shoot to kill
And my stacks up
I get pounds this pain is english, bitch I think I'm bout to wreck up
You don't get do you?
When you on the big screen, a lot of little people living through you
And if you don't stick to the script
They assassinate your character and act like they never knew you
That's just how the game goes I guess
I dress like project runway meets the projects
Write like Noah but a little more Complex
I fed niggas and they shitted on me
Took the piss out me and spilt on me
When I broke down like Britney Spears
Said they throw me—oops they never did it on me
So I wrote 'em out and made a bigger story
Vic's story that's victory
Niggas never did shit for me
Show them the ropes and jumped ship on me
But I never drowned
Stayed down, sang songs for my home town
Made homes for the broke kids stepping over needles in the playground
Y'all the only thing that matters to me
If y'all love me fuck everybody
If y'all love me they could never stop me
If y'all love me they could never stop me

Out of the fire I found a fire inside
You can see the flames still alive in my eyes
I've loved and I've lost
Through heaven and hell
Turn they back on me too many times to turn back now
My nigga I won't stop, now
I can't, I can't, I can't stop now
I can't, I can't, I can't be stopped now
I gave you my pain through pen
No I.D. on the track, let the story begin
