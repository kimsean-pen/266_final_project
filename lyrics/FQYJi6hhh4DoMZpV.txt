White lightning on the tip of my tongue
You taste nice to me,
But you complicate me
Told me if I feel like it
I could come to your home
So I go alone, show me to your room

But the lights are on and now I'm wondering
Sirens ringing in my head
My man, are we doing this?
I'm in, and I came prepared
Said "fuck it" and I took a chance
Sirens ringing in my head
My man, do you wanna dance?

My man, do you wanna
Dance
Dance
Dance-dance-dance-dance

Do you wanna
Dance
Dance-dance-dance-dance
Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna
Dance

I'm trying 'cause I wanna feel better
'Cause I like you by my side
Is it up to me to flick the switch?
You never had nobody like this
Never had you, nothing like this
So if you really want it, show me

Up the stairs into your bed
Sirens ringing in my head
My man, are we doing this?
I'm in, and I came prepared
Said "fuck it" and I took a chance
Sirens ringing in my head
My man, do you wanna dance?

My man, do you wanna
Dance
Dance
Dance-dance-dance-dance

Do you wanna
Dance
Dance-dance-dance-dance
Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna
Dance

I got what you want but that's not what you want so
When you're done making your mind up, holla, holla
Darling, I'll take your call, promise
Only if you're gonna show me something
Only I can get you hard enough to
Come back to me 'cause you know we gonna

Dance
Dance
Dance-dance-dance-dance

Do you wanna
Do you wanna
Dance
Do you wanna
Dance-dance-dance-dance

Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna
Dance
Dance
Dance-dance-dance-dance

Do you wanna
Do you wanna
Dance
Do you wanna
Dance-dance-dance-dance

Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna
