Everybody find they own thing and I guess you think you found yours
Your new thing's supposed to burn so hot, nothing like it ever before
Like the last year's model you put me down, handled me like a used car
And when you misuse the one that's been so good to you I don't believe you
Get far

Cause there's a break in the road, there's a break in every road
I got mine, you'll get yours, there's a break in every road
You just dog me around, treat me like dirt, you don't care how much I hurt
But there's a break in the road, there's a break in every road

You were the only man who could turn me on and make a bad girl out of me
Made me do things I never dreamed of now you want to set me free
Out in the cold I'm left alone while you galavant with your new girl
Down worry lane you tell them all like you ain't got a care in the world

But there's a break in the road, there's a break in every road
I got mine, you'll get yours, there's a break in every road
Riding high with your bad self but it's the woman that carry the load
I'm gonna tell ya, there's break in every road

There's a few things you don't understand about life and the things you do
Same game you ran on me, somebody's gonna run it on you
And there are newcomers gonna pull that heart, gonna wash away all of my
Tears
Well you need a new pair of windshield wipers 'cause you're not seeing
Things too clear

But there's a break in the road, there's a break in every road
I got mine, you get yours, there's a break in every road
