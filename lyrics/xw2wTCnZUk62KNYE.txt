Hey nice to meet you
Did I get your name
I recognized it spelled out in the clouds
And I remember it every time that it rains
So cheers for the good times and cheers for making a name

Clear cool lines in infinite patterns
Fluorescent lit cities of humming bulbs
I gave you a buck and you made it a million
But when you look right at it it's not even there

You can have anything that you want
Big blue eyes staring at it all
Take it from me, no one said it was easy
Tell you right now I never meant to do you wrong

If you're not sunburned
You're not having fun
And this is a joke and we laugh and now we're going home
For the first time in our lives you were happy
So we turned our backs on it all and left it alone

You can have anything that you want
Big blue eyes staring at it all
Take it from me no one said it was easy
One more time now with feeling

You can have anything that you want
