Limp footsteps stump to my door
He's coming down the corridor
Tears wash my face I cannot stand
These lessons taught by father's wreakful hand

Dreadful moments always last too long
This pain and woe just can't be gone
Dreadful moments always last too long
This pain and woe just can't be gone

Mother would you come and save me from this hell
Oh, mother I can't take this anymore
Please oh please, let me feel your hand on me forevermore
I beg you, crying out, cease reign of horror

Piercing silence is the only to reply
No one gives their aid no matter how I cry
Being fed to lions I'm left high and dry

Atrocity makes only of its own kind
Those never felt a gentle touch
Can solely clench their fists to grind
And bring this world so much of grief

Dreadful moments always last too long
This pain and woe just can't be gone
Dreadful moments always last too long
This pain and woe just can't be gone

Childhood of misery
Is lifelong injury
A burden hidden by the curtain of years
A trauma that could not be healed
Childhood of misery
Is lifelong injury
A burden hidden by the curtain of years
A trauma that could never be healed

Memories of fear and dread deeply sealed
