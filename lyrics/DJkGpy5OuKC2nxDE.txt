A car named desire
It's gone and, gone and run me down
Streetlights guide my way through the suburbs
To your house

And you're up in the ceiling
I mix you, I mix you coffee and juice
You keep saying you'll come back down now
The weather's told the truth

And you are not our lover
You are not our friend
You're just looking for someone to bail you out
Don't bring us down

And you are not our father
We cannot pretend
You threw me out in the water and turned around
Don't let me drown

Pack it up, pack it up
No, it's going on again
Walk it off as I'm leaving you right here
My only friend

You like to drinking on Sunday still
And I miss the heat when it's gone
Well, love is in the eye of the holder
I know you're holding on

And you are not our lover
You are not our friend
You're just looking for someone to bail you out
Don't bring us down

And you are not our father
We cannot pretend
You threw me out in the water and turned around
Don't let me drown

You like to drinking on Sunday still
And I miss the heat when it's gone
You like to drinking on Sunday, steal
I know you're holding on

You are not our lover
You are not our friend
You're just looking for someone to bail you out
Don't bring us down
