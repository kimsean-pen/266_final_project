Baby, it's just a single day, yeah
Feelin' so far away, yeah
Believe me
You, all that I wanna see, yeah
Every part of me, yeah

Moving into the dark of the night
All the way down, deep inside, ooh
And mama, I think you got it all, yeah
I'm gonna make it show, yeah
But it's not easy

Listen to what the people say, yeah
When you are on your way, yeah

Choosing one thing to fall to your side
Bring me in and hold it tight, ooh
Believing until the end
Turns around to begin again, ooh
