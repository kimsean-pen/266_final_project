He is my lord, He is my saviour and
He rewards my good behavior
My secret soul, I know He's seen it

He says, come here baby and
kiss me like you mean it
He calls me baby,
says kiss me like you mean it

He is my life and my salvation
He's always right,
He's always patient
I pinch myself
It's like I'm dreaming it...

He says, come here baby and
kiss me like you mean it
He calls me baby,
says kiss me like you mean it

He is my love, He's always been it...
