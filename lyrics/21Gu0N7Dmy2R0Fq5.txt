Weathered and fading
Who feels alone in the world?
You do
Too complicated
It's not the same anymore
You're through

You're signing off again
But you're my only friend
I don't know what to say
I feel the ending close

Pick up the pieces
Finding a place in the world
To be
Too many reasons
To keep an ear at the door
For me

Will you come back again?
I only need a friend
When it's all said and done
Will you need me too, girl?
Girl
Girl
Oh, girl
