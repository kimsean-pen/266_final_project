I can contemplate, but still I won't remember
All the time it takes, can take until forever

You're getting along without me
You're waking up to keep
Getting along without me
And I finally see

That I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause then I won't see anything
And I don't wanna close my eyes
'Cause then I know it only means

If I can concentrate, if I can just forget her
In the time it takes to think about forever

It's not the same in my dreams
And it's different for me
You're getting along without me
And I finally see

That I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause then I won't see anything
And I don't wanna close my eyes
'Cause then I know it only means

When I wake up you won't be here
When I wake up you won't be here

No one understands the reason why
I've been staying up awake at night
Think it's right for me to try and work it out
But now I'm lying down

And I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause then I won't see anything
And I don't wanna close my eyes
'Cause then I know it only means
That I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause then I won't see anything
And I don't wanna close my eyes
'Cause then I know it only means

When I wake up you won't be here
When I wake up you won't be near
