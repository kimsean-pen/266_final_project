Put the needle to the record,
And hit me with your style.
Soon enough I'll learn to unload my mouth.
Can you say it's getting blacker?
The vibe up in this place.
When I displaced, what made me turn my face?
Can't wait.
I can't wait.
I jumped ship to a burning sow
Had a ball.
Atom bomb.
It was quite a dirty habit,
When the last thing I do
Has a swine slewn,
Down Martyr avenue.
Am I driftwood, or hosana? I'm knee-deep in disease.
I'm a body
Laid anonymously on the beach, girl.
On the beach.
I jumped ship to a burning sow
Had a ball.
Atom bomb.
I jumped ship to a burning sow
Had a ball.
Atom bomb.
I jumped ship to a burning sow
Had a ball.
Killed a shark in there.
I jumped ship to a burning sow
Had a ball.
Atom bomb.
Denial is a river in Egypt.
Dvision is a reunion in the south.
Soon enough I'll learn to...
Denial is a river in Egypt.
Allusive as the communion in my mouth.
Soon enough I'll learn to...
I jumped ship to a burning sow
Had a ball.
Atom bomb.
I jumped ship to a burning sow
Had a ball.
Atom bomb.
Tell the one
About the man who dug
holes so deep
he lost sight of his word.
