We are not the same we have different brains
You know what I'm saying, I might be insane
You don't know me, you don't know me
Not the new me, not the old me
I do what I want, I say what I want
I live how I live, I make what I want
And I will never sell out, and you know
Just what the fuck it is I'm talking about
That paper can change a man
Make him do things I can't understand
But, we can make it if we try
Cause what we have is something that
Their money just can't buy

This is pure, this is pure
What we got, what we got, what we got
Ain't nobody else have baby

You can always tell when I'm high as hell
My minds in a cell and my soul as well
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
And if I just had everything then I would give it up (For you)
Do you understand I am my own man?
God doesn't have a plan guess my soul is damned
This world is corrupted and
I need some substance before my destruction
Then, I look into your eyes and I feel so alive
You live and you die. You dream you can fly
These moments in time are all in our mind

This is pure, this is pure
What we got, what we got, what we got
Ain't nobody else have baby
This is pure, this is pure
What we got, what we got, what we got
Ain't nobody else have baby

Sitting all alone, naked by the phone
And you ask yourself, is this real life?
Sitting all alone, naked by the phone
And you ask yourself, is this real life?
Sitting all alone, naked by the phone
And you ask yourself, is this real life?
Sitting all alone, naked by the phone
And you ask yourself, is this real life?
