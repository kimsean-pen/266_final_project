I don't know why it's so difficult
for me to talk to somebody I don't know
Well I try to ask you out about a
thousand times in my head you just always say no
And I don't care at all,
I'll drink some alcohol, it'll make me who I really wanna be
But i'm that kinda special person that
drinks too much because nobody understands me
Because everybodys got somebody, everybody but me,
Why can't anybody just tell me that i'm, somebody's?
I'm gonna lock myself inside my room with this 40 ounce on repeat

I thought that if I cleaned up my act
it'll help me understand exactly who I am
But I hate to say that it just don't work like that,
because i'm a special individual I don't need a plan
But I got bills to pay,
and I got bills to pay because I'm born and raised in the USA
And I just scream and shout that i'll
never sell out, I'll never sell out man!
Wait, How much?
Because everybody's got more money,
they got more money than me,
why can't anybody just give some more, money?
Because everybodys got somebody, everybody but me,
Why can't anybody just tell me that i'm, somebody's?
I'm gonna lock myself inside my room with the television on repeat
