You say, better messin' with your head
All 'cause I was makin' out with your friend
Love hurts, whether it's right or wrong
I can't stop, 'cause I'm having too much fun
You're on your knees
Beggin' "Please
Stay with me!"
But honestly
I just need to be a little crazy!
All my life I've been good, but now
Oh, I'm thinkin' "What the hell?"
All I want is to mess around!
And I don't really care about
If you love me, if you hate me
You can save me, baby, baby!
All my life I've been good, but now
Whoa, what the hell?
What? What? What? What the hell?
So what if I go out on a million dates?
You never call or listen to me anyway
I'd rather rage than sit around and wait all day
Don't get me wrong, I just need some time to play, yay!
You're on your knees
Beggin' "Please
Stay with me!"
But honestly
I just need to be
A little crazy (crazy!)
All my life I've been good, but now
Oh, I'm thinkin' "What the hell?"
All I want is to mess around!
And I don't really care about
If you love me, if you hate me
You can save me, baby, baby!
All my life I've been good, but now
Whoa, what the hell?
You say, that I'm messin' with-a your head, boy
I like messin' in your bed, yeah
I ain't messin' with your head, when
I'm messin' with you and
All my life I've been good, but now
Oh, I'm thinkin' "What the hell?" (what the hell?)
All I want is to mess around!
And I don't really care about (I don't care about!)
All my life I've been good, but now
Oh, I'm thinkin' "What the hell?"
All I want is to mess around!
And I don't really care about (if you love me!)
If you love me (you know), if you hate me (you know)
You can save me, baby, baby! (if you love me)
All my life I've been good, but now
Whoa, what the hell?
