Wrote a letter to you and threw it away
Spirit tried to call me, I have no words to say
Sister can you tell me if it's gonna be okay

The chains and bangles were ringing aloud
Calling out without a sound

She had witchcraft
She drank from the craft

Her eyes are the opening to a soul
Spirits lie where secrets can be told
Make her an offer, your fortune can be sold

The chains and bangles were ringing aloud
Calling out without a sound

She had witchcraft
She drank from the craft

The chains and bangles were ringing aloud
Calling out without a sound

She had witchcraft
She drank from the craft
