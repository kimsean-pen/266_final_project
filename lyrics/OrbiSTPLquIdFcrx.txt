So here we are
We are alone
There's weight on your mind
And I wanna know
The truth, if this is how you feel
Say it to me
If this was ever real

I want the truth from you
Give me the truth, even if it hurts me
I want the truth from you
Give me the truth, even if it hurts me
I want the truth

So this is you
You're talking to me
You found a million ways to let me down
So I'm not hurt when you're not around I was blind
But now I see
This is how you feel
Say it to me
If this was ever real

I want the truth from you
Give me the truth, even if it hurts me
I want the truth from you
Give me the truth, even if it hurts me

I know that this will break me
I know that this might make me cry
You gotta say what's on your mind, on your mind
I know that this will hurt me
And break my heart and soul inside
I don't wanna live this lie

I want the truth from you
Give me the truth, even if it hurts me
I want the truth from you
Give me the truth, even if it hurts
I don't care no more, no
Just give me the truth, give me the truth
'Cause I don't care no more
Give me the truth
'Cause I don't care no more, no

Just give me the truth
Give me the truth
Give me the truth
Give me the truth
Give me the truth
'Cause I don't care no more, no
