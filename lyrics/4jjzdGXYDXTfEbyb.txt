I'm driving too fast in my Lincoln Town car
And I think, I just might flip it over
I've been in a rage and I'm headed your way
With the devil on my fucking shoulder
Getting so high, that I think, I might die
And I couldn't give a shit about it
Uppin' all night, it's a clear damn sky
But my head is feeling super clouded

I've been drinking, while I'm driving down the highway
Haven't blinked in like a minute yeah, it's quite strange
I've been thinking 'bout all of the things I might say
Or might do to ya

Once I pull this trigger off
You'll be begging me to stop (yeah, yeah)
Tarantino killing love
I couldn't really give a fuck (yeah, yeah)

Telling you, I won't slow down, won't slow down
Girl, you gotta know right now, there's no way out
Imma pull the trigger off
And imma let these bullets talk (yeah, yeah)

I've been outside for a long damn time
And I figured, how this might go down
All these late nights, I could tell that you're inside
You forgot to turn your lights all out
Kicking in the door, while you're crying on the floor
Go ahead and put the phone right down
Who you tryna call, it's a quarter past four
Can't nobody hear you scream right now

I've been drinking, while I'm driving down the highway
Haven't blinked in like a minute yeah, it's quite strange
I've been thinking 'bout all of the things I might say
Or might do to ya

Once I pull this trigger off
You'll be begging me to stop (yeah, yeah)
Tarantino killing love
I couldn't really give a fuck (yeah, yeah)

Telling you, I won't slow down, won't slow down
Girl, you gotta know right now, there's no way out
Imma pull the trigger off
And imma let these bullets talk (yeah, yeah)

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (Uh)
See I'm not trying to hurt you
But I don't have a choice right now
If this is what it's come to
Then imma let it all rain down

Once I pull this trigger off
You'll be begging me to stop (yeah, yeah)
Tarantino killing love
I couldn't really give a fuck (yeah, yeah)

Telling you, I won't slow down, won't slow down
Girl, you gotta know right now, there's no way out
Imma pull the trigger off
And imma let these bullets talk (yeah, yeah)

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah

See patience is a virtue
And I'm all out of time right now
If imma send it all through
Then I sure wanna make it count
