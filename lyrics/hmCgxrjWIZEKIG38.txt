We shoot our arrows in the dark
They light the skies, standing guard
Your castle walls are made of hurt
I'll break them down with fearless love

No regrets, no defeat
Just two hearts in victory
Lay it bare, lay with me

We will be glorious
In this moment nothing matters
Glorious
Stars colliding all around us
Love me hard, don't let me go
Hold on to the afterglow
We will be glorious
Glorious

We tear, we climb into the sky
We won't fall back to Earth tonight
Your skin, your eyes, your every breath

No sin, no fear, no secrets left

No regrets, no defeat
Just two hearts in victory
Lay it bare, lay with me

We will be glorious
In this moment nothing matters
Glorious
Stars colliding all around us
Love me hard, don't let me go
Hold on to the afterglow
We will be glorious
Glorious

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

We will be glorious
In this moment nothing matters
Glorious
Stars colliding all around us
We will be glorious
In this moment nothing matters
Glorious
Stars colliding all around us
Love me hard, don't let me go
Hold on to the afterglow
We will be glorious
Glorious
