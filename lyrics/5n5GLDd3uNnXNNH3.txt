Oh, just another bloody day
I've gone the ways they said that I should go
And now sands of time have brought decay
The hand of fate is in control

Should I, should I
Pretend and close my eyes
Should I, should I
Sit in for just one more time

Oh, thousand voices calling me
To sail the seas that only I would know
I hear human sirens everywhere
Their evil tongues have turrned to stone

Should I, should I
Pretend and close my eyes
Should I, should I
Sit in for just one more time

Should I, should I
Hold back just to survive
Should I, should I
Give in like the other times before

Should I, should I
Pretend and close my eyes
Should I, should I
Sit in for just one more time

Should I, should I
Hold back just to survive
Should I, should I
Give in like the other times before
