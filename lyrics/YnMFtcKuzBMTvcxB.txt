Lovin' on my mind, lovin' on my mind
Wrapped up, packed up, ribbon with a bow on it
Lovin' on my mind, lovin' on my mind
Wrapped up, packed up, ribbon with a bow on it
(Did it up like a thriller)

Ribbon with a bow on it, ribbon with a bow on it
Ribbon with a bow on it, wrapped up, packed up
(Radio killer)
Ribbon with a bow on it, ribbon with a bow on it
Ribbon with a bow on it, wrapped up, packed up

It's only been twenty good minutes since I kissed you
Come back, boo, I miss you
Wish I had twenty million hours to caress you
And undress you, to be continued

Boy you, you don't know how it feels
When you whisper in my ear
Boy you, you give my body chills
Whenever you are near

And boy, I got your lovin' on my mind
I got your lovin' on my mind
You got me wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it

I got your lovin' on my mind
I got your lovin' on my mind
You got me wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it

Ribbon with a bow on it, ribbon with a bow on it
Wrapped up, packed up, ribbon with a bow on it
Ribbon with a bow on it, ribbon with a bow on it
Wrapped up, packed up, ribbon with a bow on it

Sometimes we argue and we fight
But they better know that that's my baby
You might even think he cute
But everybody knows that I'm his lady

Every time you see us, we super fly
So proud, he's by my side
He knows I'm ride or die
You don't know how we roll, holla at your people

Boy you, you don't know how it feels
When you whisper in my ear
Boy you, you give my body chills
Whenever you are near

And boy I got your lovin' on my mind
I got your lovin' on my mind
You got me wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it

I got your lovin' on my mind
I got your lovin' on my mind
You got me wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it

Ribbon with a bow on it, ribbon with a bow on it
Wrapped up, packed up, ribbon with a bow on it
Ribbon with a bow on it, ribbon with a bow on it
Wrapped up, packed up, ribbon with a bow on it

Boy, I'm all wrapped up in you
You make me feel so unloose
Tell me what I'm suppose to do
When you're not around

Oh baby, hey, hey, hey
Oh baby, hey, hey, hey
Oh baby, hey, hey, hey
Oh baby, hey, hey
Ooh boy, you got me, you got me, you got me

Boy, I got your lovin' on my mind
I got your lovin' on my mind
You got me wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it

I got your lovin' on my mind
Wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it

Ribbon with a bow on it, ribbon with a bow on it
(Got ribbon with a bow on it, baby)
Wrapped up, packed up, ribbon with a bow on it
(Boy, you don't even know the things you do)
Ribbon with a bow on it, ribbon with a bow on it
(I could spend my whole life with you)
Wrapped up, packed up, ribbon with a bow on it

I got your lovin' on my mind
Baby, I could spend my life with you
(Wrapped up, packed up, ribbon with a bow on it)

It's been twenty good minutes since I kissed you
Come back, boo, I miss you
(Wrapped up, packed up, ribbon with a bow on it)
Wrapped up, packed up, ribbon with a bow on it
