Looking to the right,
a turn goes by
but not for too long
Our destination
By your misfortune
We are pulling past
Pulling out (?)
But not for too long

So just embrace it Our destination

Dragging away from the high road
We should find a flock of birds big enough
to pull us up from the long road
Come on. Come with us.
We are falling straight down so don't lose hope
Land on the earth before we crash into the ground.

Lovesick teenagers don't ever die.
They will live forever
Even when you're too old.
And you think you're no more.
And you know you're no more. You'll be

Dragging away from the high road
We should find a flock of birds big enough
to pull us up from the long road
Come on. Come with us.
We are falling straight down so don't lose hope
Land on the earth before we crash into the ground.

Dragging away from the high road

We are falling straight down so don't lose hope
