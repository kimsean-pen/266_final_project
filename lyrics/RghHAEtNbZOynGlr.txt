Lost my name
Thought you found your own way
Knew you'd find it some day

Won't you elongate the time
To open both our minds up
Won't you elongate the time
To open both our minds up

Breathe in slow with the sun and the rain
Lit the fire in your brain
Cannabis, DMT, dimethyltryptamine

Won't you elongate the time
To open both our minds up
Won't you elongate the time
To open both our minds up

Your mind has waved so long
Now you know that you're truly gone

Lost my name
With the answer you'll take
And the question you'll make

Won't you elongate the time
To open both our minds up
Won't you elongate the time
To open both our minds up

Your mind has waved so long
Now you know that you're truly gone
