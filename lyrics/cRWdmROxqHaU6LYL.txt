One's not enough
I won't stop 'til I've given you up
Here, right as I am, it's hard having fun
It's much easier said than it's done

Hold me like before
Hold me like you used to
Control me like you used to

No, you don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't
'Cause I can't have you anymore

But I thought you should know
You don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't
'Cause I can't take it anymore, oh

The room's still now when I'm lying
'Cause the well of the night has gone dry
When they ask to behave I paid them no mind
Now I doubt if I'd have been so kind

Hold me like before
Hold me like you used to
Control me like you used to

No, you don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't
'Cause I can't have you anymore

But I thought you should know
You don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't
'Cause I can't take it anymore, oh

Hold me like before
Hold me like you used to
Hold me like before
Hold me like you used to

Hold me like before
Hold me like you used to
Control me like you used to

Hold me like before
Hold me like you used to
Control me like you used to

No, you don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't
'Cause I can't have you anymore

But I thought you should know
You don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't
'Cause I can't take it anymore
But I thought you should know

It feels like being tranquilized
I know the separation kills us so
But I won't stop falling like raindrops
Because I like it when you lose control

But I thought you should know
(It feels like being tranquilized)
You don't move me anymore
(I know the separation kills us so)

I'm glad that you don't
(But I won't stop falling like raindrops)
'Cause I can't take it anymore
(Because I like it when you lose control)

But I thought you should know
(It feels like being tranquilized)
You don't move me anymore
(I know the separation kills us so)

I'm glad that you don't
(But I won't stop falling like raindrops)
'Cause I can't take it anymore
(Because I like it when you lose control)

But I thought you should know
(It feels like being tranquilized)
You don't move me anymore
(I know the separation kills us so)
