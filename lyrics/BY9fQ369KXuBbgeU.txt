I stand and watch, waiting for eons for these humans to
Co-exist
Only to
Find an exceeding need to ruin everything they have achieved

Embedding horrific images into your mind
Now grovel
As intact sanity slowly dismantles into air
No conscience
Embedding horrific images into your mind
Now grovel
As intact sanity slowly dismantles into air
No conscience

All exists in the galactic radius
Uprise, survivors of this humanity
Molded from apocalyptic eras
That is endlessly provided in this plane
All exists in the galactic radius
Uprise, survivors of this humanity
Molded from apocalyptic eras
That is endlessly provided in this plane

Eliminate remaining food source, all left will starve
And resort to repugnant acts of cannibalism
Awaken the heathens and heighten their purpose
They are lost in this dimension without guidance
Eliminate remaining food source, all left will starve
And resort to repugnant acts of cannibalism
Awaken the heathens and heighten their purpose
They are lost in this dimension without guidance

A naive, and self-indulged race
Perceiving my chaos as useless death and waste
Failure to realize its true benevolence, and its plethora of possibilities, given the chance

Chariot of the divine truth
Evolution will be now

Embedding horrific images into your mind
Now grovel
As intact sanity slowly dismantles into air
No conscience
