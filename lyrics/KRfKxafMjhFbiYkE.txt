I know just how you've been feeling lately
I have seen that look in your eyes
you're in a world of confusion baby
its time to open those eyes

cause even if we're worlds apart
you know i'll be by your side

i'll be your shelter from the wind and the rain
i'll will be the keeper of the key to your heart
i will be there all of those days
as long as we're together through the
wind and the rain

i know that love doesn't know any distance

it's just a matter of faith
and it takes more than an ocean between us
to take away what we've got

always, holding
i will carry you home
