i did it, i did it
i di-, i did it all by myself
i remember what they said, ah
tried to tell me that it can't be done
can't take it from me when it's self-made, ah

so raise a glass for the chosen one
and i been workin' on it all day
you see me risin' up just like the sun
i pay my dues so i won't fade out

i-i-i'm runnin; uphill, yo
we are not the same
you might feel the pressure

i did it, i did it
i di-, i did it all by myself
i did it, i did it
i d-, i d-, i don't need no help
now, who did it? you didn't get it
no, nah, they don't disrespect me
you had your minute
now let me get it

now let me get it
yeah
now let me get it
now let me get it
get it
get it

i got that juice, and i won't waste it
i hit the ground and i run, run, run

i'm superhuman but they keep chasin'
everybody gunnin' for the champion
and you could say i took the long way
but at least i still know where i'm from
that mango juice with that bombay
bomaby, eh, yeah

(i did it, i did it)
(i di-, i did it all by myself)
i did it, i did it
i di-, i did it all by myself
i did it, i did it
i d-, i d-, i don't need no help
now, who did it? you didn't get it
no, nah, they don't disrespect me
you had your minute
now let me get it

i did it, i did it
i di-, i did it all by myself
i did it, i did it
i d-, i d-, i don't need no help
now, who did it? you didn't get it
no, nah, they don't disrespect me
you had your minute
now let me get it

now let me get it
now let me get it
now let me get it
get it
now let me get it
now let me get it
now let me get it
get it
get it
