Don't talk about money
'Cause money talks
Don't take a picture hourly
I've seen them all
I'll be your friend, I'll help you out
I'll be your friend, but I can't stand you now

Don't wanna see kissing
Or puppy love
Don't wanna see waking up in each others arms
I told my friends to cut it out
I once had friends, but I can't stand them now

Non-stop 24/7
I know you're not the only one messing
Ah, quit messing around
All you lovers been messing around
Ooh, now brother
Tidy that shit up
Ah, quit messing around
All my brothers been messing around

Toned, flat tummy
Got a new hobby
Ooh ooh, worked hard on it
So check out, so check out this body
I had a friend now he works out
I had a friend can't put his camera down

Non-stop 24/7
I know you're not the only one messing
Ah, quit messing around
All you lovers been messing around
Ooh, now brother
Tidy that shit up
Ah, quit messing around
All my brothers been messing around

Take it back, back
Turn back the technology
Take it back, back
Back in time to when I didn't find that
All of my friends were bothering me
Back, back
Take it back, back
Go now
Take it back, back

Still the world keeps changing
Soon there won't be no one else
The world keeps changing
Soon there won't be no one else
Need to put all of me out there
Hope that someone cares
Not the only one left right?
I'm not the only one left right?
I gotta face the world keeps changing
There won't be nobody else
Need to hold myself together
One foot forward than the next
Keep me moving on left, right, left, right, left, right
Keep me moving on left, right, left, right, left, right

Non-stop 24/7
I know you're not the only one messing
Ah, quit messing around
All you lovers been messing around
Ooh, now brother
Tidy that shit up
Ah, quit messing around
All my brothers been messing around

Take it back, back
Turn back the technology
Take it back, back
Back in time to when I didn't find that
All of my friends were bothering me
Back, back
Take it back, back
Go now
Take it back, back
