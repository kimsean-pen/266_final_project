You might be expecting (Oh)
To hear me saying things (Oh)
Pertaining to love me emotionally
I've been through so many other things

But I'm not wasting (Oh)
My time or energy (Oh)
On another sad love song
Babe, I love you please don't want, not even worth talking about it

Don't wanna talk about how, he broke my heart
Don't wanna talk about how, we fell apart
So many other things, I've experienced
Don't wanna make this a love song (Song)

Don't wanna get into what, made us so happy
All the moments we kissed, boy you really had me (Yeah)
Thinking this could exist, when it's just a wish
Don't wanna make this a love song

I'm not neglecting (Oh)
All those feelings (Feelings)
I have in me, but I just dont feel the need
To express them so openly (Hey, hey, hey)

That's just not me (Me)
Because when I speak (I speak)
I want the things, that are coming from me
To be something I'm proud to speak
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause everything that I'm hearing on the Radio (Oh)
Is only talking about love, how they could let it go (Yeah)
Why is it that everybody takes the lonely road
Is there no where else to go

Don't wanna talk about how, he broke my heart (Heart)
Don't wanna talk about how, we fell apart (Fell apart)
So many other things, I've experienced
Don't wanna make this a love song (Make this a love song)

Don't wanna get into what, made us so happy (Oh yeah)
All the moments we kissed, boy you really had me (Yeah)
Thinking this could exist, when it's just a wish
Don't wanna make this a love song

How can it be?
When nobody seems to care (When nobody seems to care)
The love songs are everywhere (The love songs are everywhere)
(That I hear)
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey, Hey

Don't wanna talk about how (Don't wanna talk)
He broke my heart (Yeah, yeah)
Don't wanna talk about how, we fell apart (Fell apart)
So many other things, I've experienced
Don't wanna make this a love song

Don't wanna get into what, made us so happy (No, no, no)
All the moments we kissed, boy you really had me (You really had me)
Thinking this could exist, when it's just a wish
(I don't wanna talk about another sad love song, yeah)
Don't wanna make this a love song
