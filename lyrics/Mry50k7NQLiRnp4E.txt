Let's board a plane without no destination
Take your time you're gonna need some patience, girl
A holiday
Leave the city for an open highway
Or the planet for a clear blue sky-way, oh
It's our world, girl

We need a holiday
Away from here
To Zimbabwe-babwe-babwe-babwe

It's not a change, it's just a slight vacation
Let's go around to other distant nations, now
A holiday
Leave the office for the open planes and
Leave the paperwork for other days, just go

We need a holiday
Away from here
To Zimbabwe-babwe-babwe-babwe

We need a holiday
Away from here
To Zimbabwe-babwe-babwe-babwe

We need a holiday
Away from here
To Zimbabwe-babwe-babwe
