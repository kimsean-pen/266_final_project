I've got a young heart
And it's wild and free
I don't know where it starts
But it ends with you and me
It's a hard road
As far as I can see
I don't know where I'm going
But I'll get back to you and me

'Cause we're two kids
Trying to start a fight
No matter where we go
Yeah, we'll be alright
All I'm asking for
A bit of patience, please
'Cause I know what's to come
And it's coming for you and me

Time has never been on our side
So would you wait for me?
I lead a selfish life
'Cause that's what I need
What do I have to do
To make you believe?
It's all for you and me

From a distance
I can hear you cry
But don't you worry, darlin'
Don't lose sleep tonight
I can promise it
I can guarantee
That at the end of the road
I see you with me

Time has never been on our side
So would you wait for me?
I lead a selfish life
'Cause that's what I need
What do I have to do
To make you believe?
It's all for you and me

When I look down the line
At the man I wanna be
I've always known from the start
That it ends with you and me
