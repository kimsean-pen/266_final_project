We are living in a world of hate and fear
Is this really our destiny?
Is there nothing we can do
To prevent the ultimate end of time
In every human being
Exists the seed of evil
And every day some of them try
To keep it down
We have to fight against injustice
Try to understand
It's not the way we want to live
We want to resist
We have to fight against injustice
Try to understand
We have to break the chains tonight
This will be our chance
There are always some human beings
Born to infiltrate
Our wonderful life
Spreading the seeds of evil
They lead us in the wrong direction
They want to gain
The ultimate power
Using us for their plans
