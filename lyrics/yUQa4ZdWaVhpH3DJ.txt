Innocent love
I need someone, somewhere
I need some way to come down
I need some way to make things right

Innocent love
I need someone, somewhere
I need some way to come down
I need some way to make things right

We're not happy til we're running away
Clouds in your eyes
We're nothing but the foggiest day

One of a kind
I need to keep you here
I need to picture you still
I need to clear the fog

One of a kind
I need to keep you here
I need to picture you still
I need to clear the fog

We're not happy til we're running away
Clouds in your eyes
We're nothing but the foggiest day
Clouds in your eyes
We're not happy til we're running away
Clouds in your eyes
We're nothing but the foggiest day
