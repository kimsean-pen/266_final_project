I say betrayer
I swear I've given you so much, naysayer
I watched as you just lapped it up unwilling
Addicted to be without dignity, a cheater
You thrive on lechery
I don't know what I expected
Was our time even real?
Your callous heart never seemed affected
Does a liar even know how to feel?

Unto you I proclaim
Creonte shall be your name

I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim

You're calculating
I know you know exactly what you're doing
Your selfishness your only cause
A fake, a farce
You had us all convinced
No guilt, no heart
No love, no conscience held

Unto you I proclaim
Creonte shall be your name

I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim

Time will not mend
All these mistakes have now brought forth the end
For you, my friend

Time will not mend
All these mistakes have now brought forth the end
For you, my friend, I say betrayer

A fake, a farce (you had us all convinced)
No guilt, no heart
No love, no conscience held

Unto you I proclaim
Creonte shall be your name

I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim
