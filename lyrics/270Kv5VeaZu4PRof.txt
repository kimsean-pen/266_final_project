When the hard day come from the magical lamp
That you saw there
And you can't get home
It doesn't compare
You got all love and war
When you are all uptight with fever inside
Let's get out
And if we can't do that what do you say
Let the past pass away

Into the dawn of another way of looking at
The people we've become

To a place where we played when
We were young on the cool
Breeze behind the sun

When the genes dissented and the hammer fell
Reliving
The force of the feeling that got you so down
Will you ever forgive me
It was a perfect night
And I wanted to say
I love you
And when the flood comes down I'll carry you and let the
Past pass away

Into the dawn of another way of looking at
The people we've become

To a place where we played when
We were young on the cool
Breeze behind the sun

All the cool breeze behind the sun
All the cool breeze behind the sun
All the cool breeze behind the sun
