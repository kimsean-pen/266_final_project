Heaven give me a sign
Waiting for the sun to shine
Pleasure fills up my dreams
And I love it like a baby screams

It's so useless how can you be proud
When you're sinking into the ground
Into the ground fills up my dreams
And I love it like a baby screams

Couldn't ask for more you said
Take it all and strike me dead

Waiting again
Waiting like I waited before
Waiting again
Waiting here for nothing at all
Heaven fills up my dreams
And I love it like a baby screams

Couldn't ask for more you said
Couldn't ever let it end
Take it all
Take it all and strike me dead

Heaven
