I know I'll never forget
That day the first time we met
We've come a long way since then
And I would do it all again
From your very first smile
I knew that I'd walk a mile
See, it's for real when you know
You never wanna let go
These are the reasons
I want you to know
You make this place feel like home
These are the reasons
I can't let you go, oh oh
Let's sing this song that we wrote
When we're old, ah ah
When we're old, ah ah
No matter what comes our way
I feel like you're here to stay
You were there right from the start
And let me inside your heart
After all this time
I hate the sound of goodbye
And if you leave, I would...
These are the reasons
I want you to know
You make this place feel like home
These are the reasons
I want you to know
You make this place feel like home
These are the reasons
I can't let you go, oh oh
Let's sing this song that we wrote
When we're old, ah ah
When we're old, ah ah
These are the reasons
I want you to know
You make this place feel like home
These are the reasons
I can't let you go, oh oh
Let's sing this song that we wrote
When we're old, ah ah
When we're old, ah ah
