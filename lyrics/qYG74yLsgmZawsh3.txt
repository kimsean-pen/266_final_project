Ah, yeah
Oh, baby

Can't fight the feeling, baby
Can't fight the feeling now
We got a sure thing together
Let's work it out
Don't listen to everybody, baby
Listen to your heart
I ain't got nothing but love for you, baby
And I had it from the start

Take a chance on me, baby
I wanna give it all to you

If I want you and you want me
Baby, tell me, what have we got to lose?
If I want you and you want me
Tell me, what have we got to lose?

Don't fight the feeling, baby
Don't fight the feeling now
We got a sure thing together
Let's work it out
It's a troubled, troubled world
That we're living in today, baby
We can't let nothing in this world
Stand in our way

Take a chance on me, baby
Take a chance on me

If I want you and you want me
Baby, tell me, what have we got to lose?
If I want you and you want me
Tell me, baby, what have we got to lose?

Take a chance on me, baby
Take a chance on me
I want you, baby
I gotta have you, baby
Have mercy on me
Yeah, baby
