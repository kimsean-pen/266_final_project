I don't wanna feel my face tonight
Sick of my eyes stuck on the ground
I want my mind erased tonight
Blurry faces, white laces

'Cause I'm always overthinking
I can't take this life anymore
And I feel my chest keep sinking
I just need to breathe

'Cause I can't stop the pain
And you are making it easier
'Cause I just feel the same
And you are making it easier

I want my heart to feel again
I can't get my soul to leave the ground
'Cause I just wanna run away
But I can't run from myself

'Cause I'm always overthinking
I can't take this life anymore
And I feel my chest keep sinking
I just need to breathe

'Cause I can't stop the pain
And you are making it easier
'Cause I just feel the same
And you are making it easier
You are making it easier
You are making it easier
You are making it easier
You are making it easier

Why do I
I keep on holding?
Why do I
I keep on holding
You are making it...

'Cause I can't stop the pain
And you are making it easier
'Cause I just feel the same
And you are making it easier
You are making it easier
You are making it easier
You are making it easier
You are making it easier
