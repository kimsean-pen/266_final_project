Purple in the sky
Cruising Highway 85
Thought I saw a shooting star
Beaming in your haunting eyes

Herbie Hankock on my radio
Boo let's pull over for the liquor store
Got some skittles and some Crown Royal
I know we ended things so we could go
Baby balling through me slow

Ooh don't keep you're love on me
No no love on me
Oh that night drive
Ooh you're so fine

Purple in the sky
Cruising highway 85
Thought I saw a shooting star
Beaming in your haunting eyes

I said now baby we can dissappear
Ain't lot like we are some fugitives
Liberation oh so cavalier
Ooh baby take me far away from here
Baby you know I'm sincere

Ooh don't keep you're love on me
No no love on me
Oh that night drive
Ooh you're so fine

Purple in the sky
Cruising highway 85
Thought I saw a shooting star
Beaming in your haunting eyes
