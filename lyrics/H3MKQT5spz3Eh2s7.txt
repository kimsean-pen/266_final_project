Try and fix my empty smile, Wishing the sun, would stay a while
Took my hand to help you meet the dawn And looking now, you are gone
Can you fill me with your eyes?
Sense the space that lies beneath, Have I always been this broken?
Can you take what's left of me?
Regret, steals my every breath but knowing now, You'll never rest
Tell me all that lies beyond these walls that fall, Destroying all
Can you fill me with your eyes?
Sense the space that lies beneath, Have I always been this broken?
Can you take what's left of me?
Take me with you in your arms
Can you help me, fade these scars?
Can you fill me with your eyes?
Sense the space that lies beneath, Have I always been this broken?
Can you take what's left?
Can you fill me with your eyes?
Sense the space that lies beneath?
Will I be forever punished for the secrets kept within me?
