What's new, Buenos Aires?!
I'm new!
I wanna say I'm just a little stuck on you!
You'll be on me too!

I get out here, Buenos Aires!
Stand back!
You oughta know whatcha gonna get in me!
Just a little touch of star quality!

Fill me up with your heat, with your noise, with your dirt, overdo me

Let me dance to your beat, make it loud, let it hurt, run it through me

Don't hold back, you are certain to impress

Tell the driver this is where I'm staying!

Hello, Buenos Aires!
Get this!
Just look at me dressed up, somewhere to go,
We'll put on a show!

Take me in at your flood, give me speed, ive me lights, set me humming

Shoot me up with your blood, wine me up, with your nights, watch me coming!

All I want is a whole lot of excess!
Tell the singer this is where I'm playing!

Stand back, Buenos Aires!
Because...
You oughta know whatcha gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality

And if ever I go too far
It's because of the things you are
Beautiful town, I love you!
And if I need a moment's rest
Give your lover the very best!
Real eiderdown and silence

You're a tramp, you're a treat, you will shine to the death, you are shoddy!

But you're flesh, you are meat, you shall have every breath in my body!

Put me down for a lifetime of success!

Give me credit, I'll find ways of paying

Rio de la Plata,
Florida, Corrientes, Nueve de Julio
All I want to know!

Stand back, Buenos Aires!
Because...
You oughta know whatcha gonna get in me
Just a little touch of...
Just a little touch of...
Just a little touch of star quality!
