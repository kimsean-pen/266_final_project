Yeah, I know who I am and where I stand
I am just a grain of sand getting washed from god's hand
I am nothing but a lamb at the great expanse
An ape staring into space, so damn insignificant
Primal on the vinyl I'm cro-magnificent
Title after title 'cause I'm programmed different
Dictate a flow that toe tags dissidents
No, my man, we don't go ham, listen in
We could Jon Hamm with the double m, triple threat
Nice state, isn't it? (No) Workaholics over logic and
Work the program like an alcoholic, man
Anybody, fuckin' with P, I'll beat ya lights out
Beatin' Larry Holmes outta lovely, Suffa MC
Tell me now who would wanna suffer when
the notes on ya chin like Ponda Baba, na-uh

Listen, I don't want to fall through the cracks
Like some cigarette ash from Scott Storch's keyboard
So let me bring it back to these cracks where we snack on these hats
That's what you all know me for, ooft

Ooft You'll get bodied in the (Booth)
I'm not worried 'bout a
Thing that you might say
It goes Ooft
God or money with the (Truth)
La-di-da-da-di-di-da-di-day

It's just the way of man, staring up into the great expanse
We've been making plans, howling at the moon until the day advance
Takin' out the trash, get 'em put ya place
I keep one foot upon your throat, the other foot in the grave
So kill my vibe, steal a ride, can't be strippin' the essence
I've hit my stride, signified 'bout the vicious intentions
Still they try to vilify and kill the progression
Like a stripper inside a gift, I'm tryna live in the present (Ooft)
We fight the madness we know
So sad you battle in my shadow when I'll survive the battles of both
Dagger and cloak, bro I hope you die from gagging on smoke
That's why I'm pissin' on the fire, you've been fannin' for hope

Sometimes I stop and wonder we're conjurin' something what was others
They ain't gonna love it just to love ya like Donna Summers
We're conquerors, brother, just drop the gun and don't be so reckless
Put down your arms like Ponda Baba

Ooft You'll get bodied in the (Booth)
I'm not worried 'bout a
Thing that you might say
It goes Ooft
God or money with the (Truth)
La-di-da-da-di-di-da-di-day
Ooft You'll get bodied in the (Booth)
I'm not worried 'bout a
Thing that you might say
It goes Ooft
God or money with the (Truth)
La-di-da-da-di-di-da-di-day

Man, drop it
Ooft, ooft, ooft, ooft
Ooft, ooft, ooft, ooft

This is the beginning
(Allow me to show you something)
Now we burned every track
Ooft
(Watch out)
(Work on a different idea)
Ooft
Drop that, drop it
(Allow me to show you something)
Ooft
(Watch out)
(Alright)
