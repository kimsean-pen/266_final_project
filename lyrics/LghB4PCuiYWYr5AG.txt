Endless time until tomorrow
I'm Only able to think of now
The future's made of too much sorrow
All my fears dash me to the ground
I don't mind to live in blue
Waiting for the next days due
Former times already gone
Forgot what I had done

A moment sometimes clears a day
A moment sometimes clears a sometimes
A moment sometimes clears a day
It clears a sometimes, clears a sometimes

There is nothing left to do
It seems I even lost my shadow
Have I kept a smile, from whom
A deathlike smile, oh I don't know
