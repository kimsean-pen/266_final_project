Polar opposites don't push away, It's the same
On the weekends as the rest of the days
And I know, I should go, but I'll probably stay
And that's all you can do about some things

I'm trying, I'm trying to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away
I'm trying, I'm trying to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away

Two one-eyed dogs, they're looking at stereos
Hi-fi gods try so hard
To make their cars low to the ground
These vibrations oil it's teeth
Primer gray is the color when you're done dying

I'm trying, I'm trying to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away
I'm trying, I'm trying to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away
