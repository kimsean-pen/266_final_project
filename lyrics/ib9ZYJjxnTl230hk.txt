Why did you do it?
You couldn't just laugh and walk away?
Yeah, how could you do it?
Is there any power in what I say?

How can I fix this?
I'm taking a guess you didn't stay?
How could I miss this?

You say you want it to be over
But is it ever really over?
And if it's never really over...

You say you want it to be over
But is it really ever over?
I've been trying but I can't give it up

Yeah I'm not sure about it
But I'm sure you can change my mind
Do you wanna go without me?

Yeah I'm not sure about it
But I'm sure you can change my mind
Do you even care about me?

How could you do it?
With no other thought and walk away
Why did you do it?
Is there any truth in what you say?

Are we really though it?
I always thought things would stay the same
Hang on to this feeling
Cause I wanna know when your mind changed

You say you want it to be over
But is it really ever over?
And if it's never really over

You say you want it to be over
But is it ever really over?
I've been trying but I can't give it up

Yeah I'm not sure about it
But I'm sure you can change my mind
Do you wanna go without me?

Yeah I'm not sure about it
But I'm sure you can change my mind
Do you even think about me?

Do you even think about me?
Do you even think about me?
Do you even think about me?
Do you even think about me?

Do you even think about me?
Do you even think about me?
Do you even think about me?
Do you even think about me?

Do you even think about me?
