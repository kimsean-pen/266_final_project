Girl in the corner
Stirring her soda
Biting the shit out of her straw
Ready to go out
Only her body tells her no

Pretty but sad inside
Isn't she beautiful
Queen of the ball
Even when she's home alone

And she said
I'm not here for love tonight
The way you touch just don't feel right
Used to feeling things so cold
Minimizing windows
Pictures lit by electric lights
Fiction/fact boundaries collide
Find me in my palm so bright
Cyber Stockholm Syndrome

Came here on my own
Party on my phone
Came here on my own
But I start to feel alone
Better late than never so I'll be alright
Happiest whenever I'm with you online

Better together
Ever the overrated touch
I am connected
I am the girl you want to watch
Lips full of glitter glow
Spinning like mirror balls
Phone in a strobe
Stuck in a crazy cyber world

And she said
I'm not here for love tonight
The way you touch just don't feel right
Used to feeling things so cold
Cyber Stockholm Syndrome

Came here on my own
Party on my phone
Came here on my own
But I start to feel alone
Better late than never so I'll be alright
Happiest whenever I'm with you online
In my 4 x 3
They can't get to me
Free to roam all over my cyber fantasy
Better late than never but I am alright
Happiest whenever I'm with you online

Now you see her flying hi-speed
Across the distant galaxy
Candy cane your heart out
Burn bright, don't burn out

Came here on my own
Party on my phone
Came here on my own
But I start to feel alone
Better late than never so I'll be alright
Happiest whenever I'm with you online
