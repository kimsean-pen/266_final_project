Build an inner door
Drop and then explore
You smoke your head on straight
Then drink your woes away

Some might not understand possession
Controls your head

You recognize it
While some ignore it
Avoid the masses
You've got to belong to it

Belong to it
Belong to it

Your music is your friend?
But the roof above my head
So seriously I take
The will that never breaks

Some might not understand
Possession beyond your hands

You recognize it
While some ignore it
Avoid the masses
You've got to belong to it

You recognize it
While some ignore it
Avoid the masses
You've got to belong to it

Belong to it
Belong to it

It's power and sin
(And then you've got all the other habits)
Whiskey and smoke
It's all that we could need to plant the perfect seed
Disembody me
Yeah!

You recognize it
While some ignore it
Avoid the masses
You've got to belong to it

Belong to it
Belong to it
