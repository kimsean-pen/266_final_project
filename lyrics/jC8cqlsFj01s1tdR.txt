Poutaisat pilvet haihtuvat katoen nopesti tuulten mukana kuin tama uni
Jossa en enaa sinua tavoita on liian myohaista

In a dream I saw the world beyond - no tongues telling lies
The silence was covering everything inside
In a dream I saw myself - fallen down next to me
Couldn't crawl back inside my body

No laughter on my face - reality mirrored in the deep signs of life
Too long sacrificed my feelings to the ones
Who take all 'till there's nothing in the end

I'm not in my aim - I've gotta love also the other half of me
To reach the Turning point
As only in my dreams I'm my biggest enemy

Till I'd found out that I only loved your half in me
So much time I spent - not knowing myself
Too much love I'd given for everyone but nothing for me
My light was burning 'till the end

Now you showed me that two full halves make a stronger one
Also out of me and I feel the strength
Returning into me I new-found love again

Couldn't have been fighting alone
Thank you for hearing me on time
I bless you for the trust you gave
When I didn't admit being weak

I am close to my aim truly hoping
I won't fail
Before I reach The turning point
Where we're no longer the same

Didn't notice me change
Was not living the days without names
Now I'm here with you
To stay beyond
The turning point
Of my dreams

O found my aim - now I can face myself
Again
I thank you for
Loving me
And keeping us on the right way
