Falling, falling forward looking back
Cus the paper toys are hooked into her legs
And the murmur says "we don't have time to rest"
Yeah the murmur says

Goner, she's a goner not a brat
With the paper stack toys all collected at her bed
And the maker says "you know, we take only the best"
Yeah the maker says

We're feeling posed and sweet
Good thinking, over think it
And things are looking pretty great
Walking backwards through Hollywood Factory

Charmer, we're talking better of the best,
She'll stack faster than the boys even if they start ahead.
And the taker says "she could pull us out of debt"
Yeah the taker says

We're bursting at the seams
Just think if we get lucky
And things are looking pretty great
Walking backwards through Hollywood factory

We're blocking out the scene
We're smelling all that money
And things are looking pretty great
Walking backwards through Hollywood Factory
We'll work for any creep
We're sucking in our tummies
And things are looking pretty great
Driving tractors through Hollywood Factory
Stalking actors in Hollywood Factory
Finally captured by Hollywood Factory
