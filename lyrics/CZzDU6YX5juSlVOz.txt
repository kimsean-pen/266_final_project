I wish I could cross my arms
And cross your mind
'Cause I believe
You'd unfold your paper heart and wear it on your sleeve

All my life I wish I broke mirrors
Instead of promises
'Cause all I see
Is a shattered conscience staring right back at me

I wish I had covered all my tracks completely
'Cause I'm so afraid,
Is that the light at the far end of the tunnel or just the train

Lift your arms, only heaven knows
Where the danger grows
And it's safe to say
There's a bright light up ahead and help is on the way

I forget the last time I felt brave
I just recall insecurity
'Cause it came down like a tidal wave
And sorrow swept over me

Depression please cut to the chase
And cut a long story short
Oh please be done
How much longer can this drama afford to run

Fate looks sharp, severs all my ties
And breaks whatever doesn't bend
But sadly then
All my heavy hopes just pull me back down again

I forget the last time I felt brave
I just recall insecurity
'Cause it came down like a tidal wave
And sorrow swept over me

Then I was given grace and love
I was blind but now I can see
'Cause I've found a new hope from above
And courage swept over me

It hurts just to wake up
Whenever you're wearing thin
Alone on the outside
So tired of looking in

The end is uncertain
And I've never been so afraid
But I don't need a telescope to see that there's hope
And that makes me feel brave
