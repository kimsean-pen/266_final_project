we are made from chemicals
but what holds us together is much more than that

you are strong
so much stronger than me
all along, you are everything
and i am nothing

we spend our summers writing songs
of how we'd never make it on our own
but here we are

and i surrender
i'm running thin
you were right, because you are everything
and i am nothing
