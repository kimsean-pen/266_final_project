I learnt to drive to school when I was 16
And I was happy with my friends
And we skipped class for time to breath
We learnt about the stars and the tree-es
I cried when I found kissing boys wasn't for me
So I tried every trick in the book
I tried talking to the pretty boys
And changed the way I looked
But wearing dresses to impress just
Left me lonely and upset
And the boys could tell when I looked at her
I wasn't interested in them

It's not worth hiding if you've got something to say
And it's not worth smiling if your feeling in pain
And it's
Not worth hiding if you think you might be gay
Or different in another way
You're perfect just the same!

I open the paper and it left me in shame
It says "these contagious gays aren't safe and you should keep
Your kids away."
But I grew older and bolder
And my friends caught on slowly
19 and we're through all the weight from my shoulders
And we sang

It's not worth hiding if you've got something to say
And it's not worth smiling if your feeling in pain
And it's
Not worth hiding if you think you might be gay
Or different in another way
You're perfect just the same!

So tell me anyone
If you love them as a daughter could you love them as a son
We all smile at different faces
We all blush at different names
But holding someone's hand should never
Make you feel ashamed

Your story might not be at all like mine
I don't mean to simplify, that should be in your own voice
In your own time
But the cages that they've made us
Should soon just rust away

And this song just won't need singing
But for now I'll let it play

It's not worth hiding if you've got something to say
And it's not worth dying for the people that are smiling at your name
It's not worth lying if your feeling in pain
And it's
Not worth hiding if it's happiness that could be on your way
