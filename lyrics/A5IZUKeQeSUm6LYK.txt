I was waiting all my life to know you
All about you
And now I'm staring in your eyes in sheer fear
I'm all about you

And in our minds it comes so easily
But there's a feeling coming over me
I wanna show you but there's nowhere we can really be free
Everybody's watchin'

Wouldn't it be good if we could be together

Take me away
Take me far away from here
I will run with you
Don't be afraid
Navigate and I will steer
Into the sun, we will run

I try to remember when I was just a child
In my room
My imagination used to run wild
But I never knew

That nothing's ever as it seems to be
When a dream collides with a reality
It should be easy when two people love each other to me
Everybody's talkin'

Wouldn't it be good if they would understand us

Take me away
Take me far away from here
I will run with you
Don't be afraid
Navigate and I will steer
Into the sun, we will run

We
will run...
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
We
will run...
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Wouldn't it be good if people understand us
Wouldn't it be good if we could be together...

Take me away!

Take me away
Take me far away from here
I will run with you
Don't be afraid
Navigate and I will steer
Into the sun, we will run

Whoa whoa whoa
I will run with you wherever you go
Don't be afraid
Lets run away and I will steer
Into the sun
We will run
