I was born in the desert
So I know how it feels there...
Well look up... it's a shooting star
But it's as black as night... no stars

Well this is the first thing,
That I've written
Since I wrote about freedom...
And then the wall came down
Well we thought it was a great,...beginning
People were free to cross the line
But then something happened... in the desert
Something broke the stars... into pieces

Well I live below... a great red mountain
In the shape of a great huge beast
In a place the indians call... Paradise Valley
Well this has always been my sanctuary
I send that to you... too
There on the other side of the world
In the desert...
And we are the guardians
No black clouds... just the faces of you

So where is my father,
Where has he gone
Where is my husband
Where is my son
Where is my father
Where has he gone
What is it that happened here,
Is it real... This war...
This can't be happening

Ooh well I need to see you
In your... far away war
And you should know... how much we love you They call us here, Operation Desert Angel...
They call us here, Operation Desert Angel...
In waiting... Operation Desert Shield Operation Desert Storm... Operation Desert Angel
