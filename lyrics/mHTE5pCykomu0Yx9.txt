You're my father
I obey you
I want you to be my father
I want you to be my father
You know what I am
You know what I am
I want you to kill me
I'm weak
Take what's mine
Make me feel good
Make me feel soft
Come into my room
Put your hands on my throat
Now choke me
We'll die
Make me nothing
Make me nothing
Be my father
Be my father
Think for me
Make it right
Think for me
Make it right
Put your hands on my throat
Choke me
We'll ride
