Sat under your window
Trying to read your mind
But I'm not a magician
On this October night
Said I was fascinating
That bar, we stole those shots
Now you're backtracking like I'm keys that you forgot

Cause one day you were falling
Then you're saying it's off, mmm
I know you don't really want me
I just know that you hate, you hate that I'm gone
You say "I never meant to do you wrong"
Then why call my phone up?
I'm doing good moving on
You say "I never meant to do you wrong"
Then why are you here now if you said we were done?
I don't wanna hear it
Got nothing left for you
Try act like you're innocent but I see what you do
You say "I never meant to do you wrong"
When you call my phone up
When you call my phone up you say

Do I wanna drink?
Try and get me to stay
But I've got no intentions of seeing you again
Days in my garden
You would climb the fence
Now when I sit out there it's an echo of the end

Cause one day you were falling
Then you're saying it's off, mmm
I know you don't really want me
I just know that you hate, you hate that I'm gone

You say "I never meant to do you wrong"
Then why call my phone up?
I'm doing good moving on
You say "I never meant to do you wrong"
Then why are you here now if you said we were done?
I don't wanna hear it
Got nothing left for you
Try act like you're innocent but I see what you do
You say "I never meant to do you wrong"
When you call my phone up
When you call my phone up you say

Don't know why you talking like I'll be back in a minute, in a minute
You want me by your side cause then you
feel that you're winning, that you're winning
Don't know why you talking like I'll be back in a minute, in a minute
You want me by your side cause then you feel
that you're winning Oh, you hate that I'm gone
You say

"I never meant to do you wrong"
But I know that you're lying
And you were all alone
"I never meant to do you wrong"
But I've heard that before
So this time get gone

I don't wanna hear it
Got nothing left for you
Try act like you're innocent but I see what you do
You say "I never meant to do you wrong"
When you call my phone up
When you call my phone up you say

Don't know why you talking like I'll be back in a minute, in a minute
You want me by your side cause then you
feel that you're winning, that you're winning
You say
