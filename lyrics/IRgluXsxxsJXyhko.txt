(Oh, yeah!)
(Yeah, yeah!)

An eye for an eye
A heart for a heart
That's the way that we play
Up in the clouds
Where angels fly
You take my breath away

Bridge 1:
Your love is my heaven
Now I'm going that way, hey, hey
And when I get there
You know I'm gonna stay, stay, stay

Chorus:
You're the dream of a lifetime
Whoa, yeah
You're the dream of a lifetime
Yes you are

Caught up in the roles that we play
It's a foolish game
There's nothing we can't do or be
If we want it the same

Bridge 2:
I've had all my chances
To lock you away, hey, hey
Now when I find ya
You know I'm gonna stay, stay, stay

Chorus

You know I'm dreaming of you

Solo

Bridge 1

Chorus
(Repeat)
