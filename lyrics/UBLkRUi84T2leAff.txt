You can't see me behind the door
I just heard everything you said i Don't Give a fuck but
You tell him, you're saying
All those things you used to say to me

Who is he?
I never thought you'd drop that avalanche on me
And be unfaithful
These hotel walls are paper thin, I'm going out

Seven, seven with the lime will keep me safe
Long enough to stop the thought of your embrace
Inside my head the lies that I've been fed
Throw it back behind my lips, the pain is gone

Line 'em up and knock 'em down
The night goes on and on and on
To let me cope with this disaster

I'm seven deep
Her brown hair and blue eyes
Looking right at me

Who is she?
I never thought I'd ever think of stepping out
I'll fight this temptation
This crowded bar is full of sin, I'm going out

Seven, seven with the lime will keep me safe
Long enough to stop the thought of your embrace
Inside my head the lies that I've been fed
Throw it back behind my lips, the pain is gone

Line 'em up and knock 'em down
The night goes on and on and on
To let me cope with this disaster

I'm not coming home tonight
I'd rather sleep on the street
I'm not coming home to you
I'd won't sleep with the devil

I'm not coming home tonight
I'd rather sleep on the street
I'm not coming home to you
I'd won't sleep with the devil

I'm not coming home tonight
I'd rather sleep on the street
I'm not coming home to you
I'd won't sleep with the devil
On this city street I'll rest my head tonight
I'm going out
Seven, seven with the lime will keep me safe
Long enough to stop the thought of your embrace
Inside my head the lies that I've been fed
Throw it back behind my lips, the pain is gone
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
The night goes on and on and on
To let me cope with this disaster
