just say the word
we'll take on the world
just say you're hurt
we'll face the worst, oh

i can see, see the pain in your eyes
oh believe, believe me and i have tried
no i wont, i won't pretend to know what you've been through
you should know, i wish it was me not you
and just say the word
we'll take on th world
and just say you're hurt
we'll face the worst

nobody knows you the way that i know you
look in my eyes i will never dessert you
and just say the word
we'll take on the world

and it's the fight
the fight of our lives
you and i we were made to thrive
oh yeah
and i am your future
and i am your past
never forget we were built to last

step out of the shadows and into my life
silence the voices thay haunt you inside

and just say the word
we'll take on th world
and just say you're hurt
we'll face the worst

nobody knows you the way that i know you
look in my eyes i will never dessert you
and just say the word
we'll take on the world
we'll take on the world

oh oh oh oh

and nobody knows you
the way that i know you
and nobody knows you
the way that i know you

we'll fight, we'll crawl, into the night
i wont let go with you by my side
the calm, the storm we'll face it all

and just say the word
we'll take on the world
and nobody knows you
the way that i know you
look in my eyes i will never dessert you
and just say the word (just say the just say the word)
we'll take on the world
take on the world
