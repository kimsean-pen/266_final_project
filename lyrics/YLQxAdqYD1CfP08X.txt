When I saw you I knew you were the one
I want to orbit you like you're the sun
but let me know before I come undone
am I the one for you

I'm like a puzzle with a missing piece
I got a car but didn't get the keys
and only you can set my mind at ease
so what am I to do

I have everything but the girl I want, it's sad but true
and everything but the love I need to make it through
and every time I look into your eyes, that's when I realize
just how much I love you

Some say lady luck is on my side
and that my life has been an easy ride
but they don't know how many times I cried
cause I am nothing without you

I have everything but the girl I want, it's sad but true
and everything but the love I need to make it through
and everytime I look into your eyes, that's when I realize
just how much I love you

I don't know how long I can keep it up
I need a sign to make it through
You gotta tell me now, you gotta let me know
so what am I, what am I to do
