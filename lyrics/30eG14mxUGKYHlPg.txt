On that night that I
Got lost within the dust
It had filled my lungs
With the memory of us
On that night when we
Met upon the barren field
Your embrace told me
Not to tell you how I feel

You had ripped your jeans
(You had ripped your jeans)
Somehow
You said you'd fallen down
("And would you believe")
Somehow
("That I am married now")
You had ripped your jeans
("Somehow")
You said you'd fallen down
"And would you believe"
"That somehow"
"I am married now"

On that night that I
Was lost within the dust
It had filled my lungs
With the memory of us
On that road when we
Spoke of stone and dust and light
You had everything
But a place to stay the night

You had ripped your jeans
(You had ripped your jeans)
Somehow
You said you'd fallen down
("And would you believe")
Somehow
("That I am married now")
You had ripped your jeans
("Somehow")
You said you'd fallen down
"And would you believe"
"That somehow"
"I am married now"

"What are the chances?
These circumstances?
And no one else around?
I can't remember
How I arrived here
Or how I'd fallen down"

"What are the chances?
These circumstances?
Yours was a gorgeous bed
I can't remember
Just how I got here
I must have hit my, I must have hit my head"

On that road when we
Spoke of stone and dust and light
You had everything
But a place to stay...

You had ripped your jeans
(You had ripped your jeans)
Somehow
You said you'd fallen down
("And would you believe")
Somehow
("That I am, I am")
You had ripped your jeans
("Somehow")
You said you'd fallen down
"And would you believe"
"That somehow"
"I am married now"
