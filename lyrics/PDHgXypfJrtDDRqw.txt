Strangers in a dark room, laughing at jokes they didn't quite hear
Frosted window panes and cheap champagne a face appears
And anything could happen in these cathedrals we roam
Where shadow people dance and trade their glance and walk home alone

She's staring out the window of the Roosevelt Hotel
Watching midtown empty out and I kiss her farewell
They say we come from nothing and to nothing we'll return
And in between is gravity and bridges left to burn
