another window, another way out
i feel it coming, i'm pushing it down
another window, another way out
another window

i don't have the will or time to think of something to say to you
i see it in your almond eyes, a sure sign of nothing new
and if you want to move down to a more hospitable latitude
i know it's not your fault

another window, another way out
i feel it coming, i'm pushing it down
another window, another way out
another window

i've been around long enough, now don't you deceive me
you will never know unless you cut me open
and god knows, for every stitch that i have been sewing
you won't hesitate to cut me open
cut me
cut me open
