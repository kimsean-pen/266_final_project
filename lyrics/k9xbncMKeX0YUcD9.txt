The secrets that you've always told me
I've put them all behind through getting high
The secrets that I never should've known
Are running through my veins into my soul

It just comes in handy for a bad day
All I wanna do is get a little hazed
This just comes in handy for a bad day
This just comes in handy for a bad day

The heroin I take just helps me die
A slower death that keeps my soul alive
My dreams are filled as mystery unfolds
Another hedonistic tended goal

This just comes in handy for a bad day
All I wanna do is get a little hazed
This just comes in handy for a bad day
This just comes in handy for a bad day
