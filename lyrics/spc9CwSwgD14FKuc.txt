I'll always think of you as I'll try to cross the endless ocean.
As long as my guides are guiding me I don't know how much time I need.
My dreams sometimes look so far away.
And I feel like I am lost.

There are angels all around me.
They give faith and hope with wings to fly.
And I have to fly right now.
To the sky to find tomorrow.

I keep calling you but there's no answer from you.
I'm drifting all by myself.
So many tears are falling down.
I'll always think of you as I'll try to cross the endless ocean.

As long as my guides are guiding me I don't know how much time I need.
Its a miracle that we can find each other in this world.
Don't know how far it is to get there.
But we know we're always happy.

As we're trying to look for our dreams.
Together.
