Born with a question
Born with a future past
In my invention
Call me a natural act
Now is forever
Now is an old re-run
Call me too far gone
To the point of no return

Obsess to possess
A lifeline is altered
I wasn't long before I learned
Obsess to excess
Is all I wanna do and can
And the voice that calls us forever
Is the ghost of chance

Day in day out
Coming upside down
Will hit the heart of me
Mix me up
Coming this time round
Will hit the heart of me

Life is a museum
Mind is the scene of the crime
Always looking out
And always a crime of mine
Live in a camera live in a cinema
There is nothing more than thinking
Nothing more than thinking
Dream, scheme fast and live now

Day in day out
Falling upside down
Will hit the heart of me

Mix me up
Coming this time round
Oh hit the heart of me

Day in day out
Coming this time round
It hit the heart of me
I'm a real mix up
Pull me inside and out
It's the heart of me

Day in day out
Coming this time around
And hit the heart of me
And hit the heart of me
And hit the heart of me
