The visions dancing in my mind
The early dawn, the shades of time
Twilight crawling through my windowpane
Am I awake or do I dream?
The strangest pictures I have seen
Night is day and twilight's gone away

With your head held high and your scarlet lies
You came down to me from the open skies
It's either real or it's a dream
There's nothing that is in between

Twilight, I only meant to stay a while
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind away from me

Across the night I saw your face
You disappeared without a trace
You brought me here, but can you take me back?
Inside the image of you light
That now is day and once was night
You leave me here and then you go away

It's either real or it's a dream
There's nothing that is in between

Twilight, twilight, twilight
I gave you time to steal my mind away from me

You brought me here, but can you take me back again?

With your head held high and your scarlet lies
You came down to me from the open skies
It's either real or it's a dream
There's nothing that is in between
Twilight, I only meant to stay a while
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind
Twilight, I only meant to stay a while
Twilight, I only meant to stay a while

Twilight, twilight, twilight, twilight
