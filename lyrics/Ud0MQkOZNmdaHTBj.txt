Some folks like water,
Some folks like wine,
But I like a taste,
Of straight strychnine,
You may think it's funny,
That I like this stuff,
But once you've tried it,
You can't get enough,
The wine is red,
And poison is blue,
Strychnine is good,
Oh what's a? to you,

The wine is red,
And poison is blue,
Strychnine is good,
Oh what's a? to you, oh oh oh

If you listen to what I say,
And you try strychnine someday,
Make you choke,
It'll make you shout,
Illegal, and knock you high,
Some folks like water,
Some folks like wine,
But I like the taste,
Of straight strychnine,

Strychnine(ay ay)
Strychnine(ay ay)
Strychnine(ay ay)
Strychnine(ay ay)
