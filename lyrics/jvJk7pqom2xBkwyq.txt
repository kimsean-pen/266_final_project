I went on the search for something true
I was almost there when I found you
Sooner than my fate was wrote
A perfect blade, it slit my throat
And beads of lust released into the air
When I awoke you were standing there

I was on the mend when I fell through
The sky around was anything but blue
I found as I regained my feet, a wound across my memory
That no amount of stitches would repair
But I awoke and you were standing there

There's no fortune at the end of the road
That has no end
There's no returning to the spoils
Once you've spoiled the thought of them
There's no falling back asleep
Once you've wakened from the dream
Now I'm rested and I'm ready and I'm ready to begin

I went on the search for something real
Traded what I know for how I feel
But the ceiling and the walls collapsed
Upon the darkness I was trapped
And as the last of breath was drawn from me
Light broke in and brought me to my feet

There's no fortune at the end of the road
That has no end
There's no returning to the spoils
Once you've spoiled the thought of them
There's no falling back asleep
Once you've wakened from the dream
Now I'm rested and I'm ready and I'm ready to begin

I'm rested and I'm ready to begin
