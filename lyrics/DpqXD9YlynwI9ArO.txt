As a child, you would wait
and watch from far away

But you always knew that you'll be
the one that work while they all play

And you, you lay, awake at night and scheme
of all the things you that would change
but it was just a dream!

Here we are, don't turn away now
we are the warriors that built this town

Here we are, don't turn away now
we are the warriors that built this town

The time will come, when you'll have to rise
above the best, improve yourself,
your spirit never dies!

Farewell, I've gone, to take my throne
above, don't weep for me because
this will be the labor of my love

Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town

Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town from dust

Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town

Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town from dust
