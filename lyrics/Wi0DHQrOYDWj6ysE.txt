What are you gonna do?
I've been waiting a while to take you
Your friends will they understand
When I leave holding your hand?

Driving late at night
I'll let you listen to the music you like
Then I'll drop you home

When are you gonna see?
I carved your name in the cherry tree
From the window when you look outside
I'll be there, you know I won't hide

Driving late at night
I'll let you listen to the music you like
Then I'll drop you home

Drop you home
Drop you home

What are you gonna, what are you gonna do?
I've been waiting a while to take you
What are you gonna, what are you gonna do?
I've been waiting a while to take you
What are you gonna, what are you gonna do?
I've been waiting a while to take you
What are you gonna do?
If you're looking for someone new

Driving late at night
I'll let you listen to the music you like
Driving late at night
Everything's alright

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
