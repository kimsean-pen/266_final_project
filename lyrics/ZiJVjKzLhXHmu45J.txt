I know it's not the same, but I feel it anyway
Tell me if that's okay
Know I'll be on my way, should've known, now, I feel insane
Am I insane?

I've waited way too long, yeah, I know you've changed
You have a different face to me
I guess that I was wrong, I'm the one to blame
And that's a shame you see

Ooh ooh ooh, you're in my head
And I keep on forgetting
Ooh ooh ooh, you're here instead
And it seems never ending

Ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh, I know
I know you've changed, you don't feel the same
Ooh ooh ooh
You're in my head

You say it's all alright, but you're not who's up at night
You'll probably say we tried
This feels like all a lie, while you tend to try and hide
Your hold has got me tied

I've waited way too long, yeah, I know you've changed
You have a different face to me
I guess that I was wrong, I'm the one to blame
And that's a shame you see

Ooh ooh ooh, you're in my head
And I keep on forgetting
Ooh ooh ooh, you're here instead
And it seems never ending

Ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh, I know
I know you've changed, you don't feel the same
Ooh ooh ooh
You're in my head

And nothing else is right
You're laced inside my mind
I'm holding on, I know it's wrong
But I can't see your soul

And everything has changed
You're only in my brain
I can't seem to let this be
But I guess I'll be vain

Ooh ooh ooh, you're in my head
And I keep on forgetting
Ooh ooh ooh, you're here instead
And it seems never ending

Ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh, I know
I know you've changed, you don't feel the same
Ooh ooh ooh
You're in my head
