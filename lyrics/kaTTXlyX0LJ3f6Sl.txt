Motorcycle help me run
From everything I've ever done
It's alright if you wanted to run, if you wanted to stay, if you wanted to get away
On my motorcycle
On my motorcycle
On my motorcycle there's the feeling I might go insane before I reach the places that I'd want to go

Motorcycle help me fly
Cause I'll never feel this way in life
It's alright if you wanted to cry, if you wanted to hold, if you wanted to hate me until I'm old
On my motorcycle
On my motorcycle
On my motorcycle there's the feeling I might go insane before I reach the places that I'd want to go

On my motorcycle
On my motorcycle
On my motorcycle there's the feeling I might go insane before I reach the places that I'd want to go
