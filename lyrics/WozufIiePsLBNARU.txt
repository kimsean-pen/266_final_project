t takes a lot of effort
To hold on to all your rules
It can take years to fight movement
It can take years off you!

Out I've been good intentions
While nothing a waiting game
It's been 3 years of then holding the wrath,
But holding on is something wrong

Time after time, when what you're hoping to find
Is not a SIMPLE DESIGN, but a headache
When everything you've built comes falling down
But if you open your mind to a slippery life
When that's look for the time
When that's ready
and everything you need falls to you!

If like to consider the measure
Measure the risk of reward
What makes you think they will love you?!
They just wanna love you more
Take up your sleep in giant
Wake up your terracell
They've let the path and you're well on your way
You'll FIGHT THIS TIME

Time after time, when what you're hoping to find
Is not a SIMPLE DESIGN, but a headache
and everything you've built comes falling down
But if you open your mind to a slippery life
When that's look for the time
When that's ready,
And everything you need falls to you!

Falls to you, falls to you
It's all on you
Falls to you, falls to you ready
It's all on you
Falls to you, falls to you ready
That's all on you, ready
Falls to you, falls to you ready
That's all on you, ready

Time after time, when what you're hoping to find
Is not a SIMPLE DESIGN, but a headache
When everything you've built comes falling down
But if you open your mind to a slippery life
When that's look for the time
When that's ready
And everything you need falls to you
