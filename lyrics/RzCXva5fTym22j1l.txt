I see you've been callin' and callin' and callin' and callin' again
Say your a wreck
But I don't give a damn
Cuz when I was callin' and callin' and callin' and callin' you then
Where were you at
I couldn't trust a word that you say
She can't do the shit I do
Cuz your calling me at two
And you don't got a chance get that through your head
Was it worth it all to you
Get a taste of something new
Don't go tellin' me I'm so pretty (nah nah)
So different (nah nah)
Your committed (nah nah)
Cuz telling someone else she's so pretty (nah nah)
So different (nah nah)
You aren't committed (nah nah)
Thank god that my new guy isn't you
Say my name say my name
Your wear that shit out like I'm famous
Swear that my new guy the greatest
And thank god I couldn't save us
Hey
You ain't my problem outside about walking away
Now I have nothing to say
So why you calling me day after day
Like fuck off
I don't wanna hear it from you
Your not ever gonna say so you do
And I ain't with another no good lier like you
It's true
Don't go tellin' me I'm so pretty (nah nah)
So different (nah nah)
Your aren't committed (nah nah)
Cuz telling someone else she's so pretty (nah nah)
So different (nah nah)
Your committed (nah nah)
I don't need you telling me I'm pretty (nah nah)
Your no different (nah nah)
You aren't committed (nah nah)
Thank god that my new guy isn't you
You

Different girls in your bed from the club
Bet it's lonely as Fuck out of love
