I hear you crying and I know what it's like to be alone
You're scared and I'm not there
It's like you're living with a ghost
someone you can't hold
and you say it's so unfair

And just so you know the distance is what's killing me
time and space have become the enemy
And what I need is so far away
and so it goes
the distance makes it hard to breathe
My heart won't let go easily
I don't want to be this far away

I'm lying by myself and silence seems to swell
someday this all will change
its a temporary pain
see your face and speak your name
till then i'll scream into the night.

And just so you know the distance is what's killing me
time and space have become the enemy
And what I need is so far away
and so it goes
the distance makes it hard to breathe
My heart won't let go easily
I don't want to be this far away

Well i got my life and you got my world tonight

and i miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
And just so you know the distance is what's killing me
time and space have become the enemy
And what I need is so far away
and so it goes
the distance makes it hard to breathe
My heart won't let go easily
I don't want to be this far away.
