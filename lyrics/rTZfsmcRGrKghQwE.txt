Me no bubbletious
Me smoke heavy tar
Me be groovin' slowly where you are
Notify your next of kin
'Cause your never coming back
I've been dropping beats since back in black

And we'll paint by numbers
Till something sticks
Don't mind doing it for the kids
So come on

Jump on board, take a ride, yeah
(You'll be doin' it alright)
Jump on board, feel the high, yeah
'Cause the kids are alright

You've got a reputation
Well, I guess that can be explored
You're dancing with the chairman of the board
Take a ride on my twelve cylinder symphony
But if you've got other plans
The purpose of a woman is to love her man

And we'll paint by numbers
Till something sticks
Don't mind doing it for the kids
So come on

Jump on board, take a ride, yeah
(You'll be doin' it alright)
Jump on board, feel the high, yeah
'Cause the kids are alright

I'm gonna give it all of my loving
It's gonna take up all of my love
I'm gonna give it all of my loving
It's gonna take up all of my love

It's gonna take up all of my love
It's gonna take up all of my love
It's gonna take up all of my love

Come down from the ceiling
I didn't mean to get so high
I couldn't do what I wanted to do when my lips were dry
You can't just up and leave me I'm a singer in a band
Well, I like drummers, baby, you're not my bag

And we'll paint by numbers
Till something sticks
Don't mind doing it for the kids
So come on

Jump on board, take a ride, yeah
(You'll be doin' it alright)
Jump on board, feel the high, yeah
'Cause the kids are alright

And we'll paint by numbers
Till something sticks
Don't mind doing it for the kids
So come on

Jump on board, take a ride, yeah
(You'll be doin' it alright)
Jump on board, feel the high, yeah
'Cause the kids are alright
