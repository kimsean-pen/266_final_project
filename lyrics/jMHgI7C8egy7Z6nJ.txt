I just finished writing Jubilee Street
I lay down on my bed and fell into a deep sleep
When I awoke, I believed I'd taken a bride called Mary Stanford
And I flew into a frenzy searching high and low
Because in my dream, the girl was very young
I said, 'Hey little girl, where do you hide?'
You draw lightning from the sky

Oh, all of this and her dark hair
And all of this and her dark hair, oh Lord
Oh, see that girl coming on down
Coming on down, coming on down
See that girl coming on down
Coming on down, coming on down

Last night your shadows scampered up the wall
It flies and leaped like a black spider between your legs
And cried, my children, my children
They are lost to us

All of this and her dark hair, oh no
All of this and her dark hair, oh Lord
See that girl coming on down
Coming on down, coming on down
See that girl coming on down
Coming on down, coming on down
See that girl coming on down
Coming on down, coming on down
See that girl coming on down
Coming on down, coming on down
