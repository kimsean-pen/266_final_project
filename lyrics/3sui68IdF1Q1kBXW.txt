There's Beer
In coffee mugs, water bottles, and soda cups
And it's clear, as the wondows I came through
That you
Are in one of those moods
And I am in one of them too
And it's hard, to communicate, anything
I will remember that summer
As the summer I was taking steroids
Cause you like a man with muscles
And I like you
It's the "cops are comming in" type of sobering up
It's a girl that never learned that I could not give enough
My friends are happy, I'm happy, I've learned to adapt
To this darker kind of humor, I can still hear em' laugh
And ther is beer
It is in coffee mugs, water bottles and soda cups
And it's clear as the window I came through
I will remember that summer
As the summer I was taking steroids
Cause you like a man with muscles
And I like you
And it's an arial view from your house to my room
And it's an arial view from your house to my room
And I am looking through your windows
And I am trying not to stare
I'm holding on to hope I'm sure was never even there
But it's an arial view
Your house, my room
As the summer I was taking steroids
As the summer I was taking steroids
As the summer I was taking steroids
