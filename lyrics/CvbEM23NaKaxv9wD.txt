Vampires are surrounding me
But they don't wait til I go to sleep
They bite creativity
Yeah, they feed off me
They feed off me

Vampires are the enemy
Cause they'll do anything to get to me
They breed but they never bleed
So they bleed from me
Yeah they bleed and

It's bringing me down
It sucks the life from me
Put me into the ground
Kill my misery

Vampires only want to pose
Empty mirror but nobody knows
They kill just to be exposed
And they won't let go
They won't let go

Vampires don't know how to die
They disappear and then they multiply
They live just to take your life
So they take what's mine
Yeah they take and

It's bringing me down
It sucks the life from me
Put me into the ground
Kill my misery

It's bringing me down...
