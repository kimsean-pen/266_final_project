I'm home again, I won the war
and now I am behind your door.
I tried so hard to obey the law
see the meaning of it all.
Remember me? Before the war
I'm the man who lived next door.
Long ago...

As you can see, when you look at me
I'm pieces of what I used to be.
It's easier if you don't see
Me standing on my own two feet.
I'm taller when I sit here still
you ask are all my dreams fulfilled.
They made me a heart of steel
the kind the bullets cannot see.

Nothing's what it seems to be
I'm a replica, I'm a replica
Empty shell inside of me
I'm not myself, I'm a replica of me...

The light is green, my slate is clean
New life to fill the hole in me.
I had no name, last December
Christmas Eve I can't remember.
I was in a constant pain
I saw your shadow in the rain.
I painted all your pictures red
I wish I had stayed home instead.
Yeah!

Nothing's what it seems to be
I'm a replica, I'm a replica
Empty shell inside of me
I'm not myself, I'm a replica of me...

Are you gonna leave me now, when it is all over
Are you gonna leave me, is my world now over...

Raising from the place I've been
and trying to keep my home base clean.
Now I'm here
and won't go back believe.

I fall asleep and dream a dream
I'm floating in a silent stream.
No-one placing blame on me
But nothing's what it seems to be, yeah.

Nothing's what it seems to be
I'm a replica, I'm a replica
Empty shell inside of me
I'm not myself, I'm a replica...
Nothing's what it seems to be
I'm a replica...
Empty shell inside of me
I'm a replica of ...
Nothing's what it seems to be
I'm a replica,
Empty shell inside of me
I'm a replica,
Nothing's what it seems to be
I'm a replica,
Empty shell inside of me
I'm a replica of... (me)
I'm home again, I won the war
and now I am behind your door.
I tried so hard to obey the law
see the meaning of it all.
Remember me? Before the war
I'm the man who lived...
