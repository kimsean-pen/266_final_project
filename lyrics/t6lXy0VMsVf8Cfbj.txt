It might be impractical to seek out a new romance
we won't know the actual if we never take the chance
I'd like to collapse with you and ease you against this song
I think we're compatible, I see that you think I'm wrong

any time will do, my love
any time will do, no choice of words will break me from this groove
any time will do, my love
any time will do, what choice of words will take me back to you?

your love makes a fool of you, you can't seem to understand
a heart doesn't play by rules and love has it's own demands
but I'll be there to take care of you if ever you should decide
that you don't want to waste your life in the middle of a lovesick lullaby

any time will do, my love
any time will do, no choice of words will break me from this groove
any time will do, my love
any time will do, the choicest words will take me back to you

oh my reddest rose, caldera, set it off
how your fire grows hermosa caldera
glistening through your fussed blows careen your caldera
set it off, as your body flows the second hand flashes
passes over your skin like time

My love, any time will do
