There doesn't have to be a reason
There doesn't have to be a why
And any moment could be magical
It could be this night

You've got an energy
burnin' like I've never seen
Bringing me to life
And I

Can't beat the feeling
That I get
When I'm
with you
My heart plays a rhythm in my head
I can't help
But move
Two people synchronized

Like a power
Brings you closer
Right beside it
Can't beat the feeling
That I get
When I'm
with you

Feel the force of the reaction
Let it take you on a ride
And all resistance is illogical
When your love slides

We got an energy
Fast revolving 'round our feet
Bringin' us to life
And I

Can't beat the feeling
That I get
When I'm
with you
My heart plays a rhythm in my head
I can't help
But move
Two people synchronized

Like a power
Brings you closer
Right beside it
Can't beat the feeling
That I get
When I'm
with you
We've got an energy

We've got an energy
We've got an energy
We've got an energy
We've got an energy
We've got an energy
We've got an energy, energy, energy...
We've got an energy

Burnin' like I've never seen
We've got an energy
Bringin' us to life
Can't beat the feeling

That I get
When I'm
with you
My heart plays a rhythm in my head

I can't help
But move

Two people synchronized
Like a power
Brings you closer
Right beside it
Can't beat the feeling
That I get
When I'm
with you
Oooooh, yeah
Oooooh, yeah
Oooooh, yeah
Oooooh, yeah
