Cola bottle shake baby
You're freaking me out girl

I don't care now

Cause you ain't fooling me

Can't you call a girl that made a fool out of me?

Oh, when you look into her eyes
You can't believe all the lies, the lies
And the alibis

Freaking my mind out

But that's just a lie

That's when you start to surmise
That she would do all the lies

Cola bottle shake baby
Freaking my mind out

That's when you start because you believe all the lies and alibis
Cola bottle shake
Fizz fizz fizz fizz fizz she's got that much technically
7-Up fizz fizz
Fizz fizz fizz fizz fizz she thinks she's perfectly free
Leaves you sugar free
