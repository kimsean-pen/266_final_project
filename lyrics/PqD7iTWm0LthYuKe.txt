Wait for me dead
When light hits floor
When our cancer
Has swept her away

We are the sleepers
Black sun heralds new dawn

It's all we know
Black holes and static eyes

We are the sleepers
Swarm contained in her tower

We mesh our flesh and bone
With her mechanical mind

We are the sleepers
We are dead and reborn
