Samson
The strength
That's in your arms
Oh to be
Your stunning bride

Samson
Your hair
Glistening like sun
Oh would
That it were mine

Samson
Your hair
That's in my hands
I'll keep it safe
You're mine
You're mine

He said wait
Said wait
Delilah, my babe
Delilah, my babe
Said wait
Said wait
Delilah, my babe
Delilah, my babe
Said wait
Said wait
Delilah, my babe
You lied in my face
You cut off my hair
You lied in my bed

Samson
Your stay
With your 'lilah
I'll hold you in my hands
Your hair
Your strength
My man
My man

He said wait
Said wait
Delilah, my babe
Delilah, my babe
Said wait
Said wait
Delilah, my babe
Delilah, my babe
He said wait
Said wait
Delilah, my babe
Delilah, my babe
Said wait
Said wait
Delilah, my babe
You lied in my face
You cut off my hair
You lied in my bed
