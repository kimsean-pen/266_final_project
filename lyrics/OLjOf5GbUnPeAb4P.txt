Where have we gone?
What have we done?
Where have we gone?
Nowhere left to run

Pray for war, pray for death, pray for hate
Pray for all that you know
All these years, ain't nothing's changed
And you know, and you know, yeah

Spiral of darkness
As the fools awaits
Peace through destruction
Has sealed our fate

Pray for war, pray for death, pray for hate
Pray for all that you know
All these years, ain't nothing's changed
And you know, and you know, yeah

Pray for war, pray for death, pray for hate
Pray for all that you know
All these years, ain't nothing's changed
And you know, and you know, yeah
