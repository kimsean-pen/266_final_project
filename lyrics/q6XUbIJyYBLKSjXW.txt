At the time it was alright, but
Looking back, I hurt my eyes
Maybe all the
Angels had to fly

You got a little bit high
You're looking better than I
Better, better
I hope you're feeling better
You got a little bit high
You're looking better than I
Better, better
I need you feeling better

And the sun was in my eyes
But it's home is in the sky
And I couldn't ask for anything
You're always on my side and
Everyone's alive so everything's alright, but
Maybe when the summer ends, I'll drift away from all my friends
The sun was in my eyes
But it's home is in the sky
And I couldn't ask for anything
You're always on my side and
Everyone's alive so everything's alright, but
Maybe when the summer ends I'll drift away from all my friends

Everyone is really nice
Sugar sweet and sugar high
Wait and see if
This will last the night
So I'm slashing all my tires
And I'm cutting all my ties
And I'm sorry that I even let you promise that you'd try and
All your friends are nice, but you like throwing dice so
Maybe that's the reason all the angels had to hide

You got a little bit high
You're looking better than I
Better, better
I hope you're feeling better
You got a little bit high
You're looking better than I
Better, better
I need you feeling better

And the sun was in my eyes
But it's home is in the sky
And I couldn't ask for anything
You're always on my side and
Everyone's alive so everything's alright, but
Maybe when the summer ends I'll drift away from all my friends
The sun was in my eyes
But it's home is in the sky
And I couldn't ask for anything
You're always on my side
Everyone's alive so everything's alright, but
Maybe when the summer ends I'll drift away from all my friends

And at the end you just got high
Now I've got an angel in the sky
Now I've got an angel in the sky
