My baby drives a car
(Hey!)
He calls me when he wants
(Hey!)
I don a pair of zip-up boots (uh huh huh)
I go and shake my hair out loose (uh huh huh)
I never take my eyes off you
Oh no no, oh no no
No I don't think so

Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
This won't last for long, not forever
And the champagne makes it taste so much better better
Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
Dreams of number one last forever
It's the only way to make you feel better

Footloose and fancy-free
(Hey! Oh)
My baby waits for me
(Hey! Oh oh oh)
He likes to put his own records on (uh huh huh)
He likes to tell me the things he's done (uh huh huh)
Such a strange way of having fun
(Oh no no, oh no no)
And away we go

Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
This won't last for long, not forever
And the champagne makes it taste so much better better
Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
Dreams of number one last forever
It's the only way to make you feel better

Hey, stop!

You made a promise to make me a star
(A hat, a lift)
You made a promise I'd get to the top
(A chat, a gift)
You made a promise to make me a star
(A drink, a kiss)
You made a promise I'd get to the top
(A hit, a miss)

Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
This won't last for long, not forever
And the champagne makes it taste so much better better
Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
Dreams of number one last forever
It's the only way to make you feel better

(You made a promise to make me a star)
Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
(You made a promise I'd get to the top)
All I seem to get is the other other
(You made a promise to make me a star)
This won't last for long, not forever
(You made a promise I'd get to the top)
And the champagne makes it taste so much better better
(You made a promise to make me a star)
Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
(You made a promise I'd get to the top)
All I seem to get is the other other
Dreams of number one last forever
It's the only way to make you feel better.
