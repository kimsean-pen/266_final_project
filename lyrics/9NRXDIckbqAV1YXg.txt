I call you up
With nothing much to say
My words are lost
Just hope that you're okay

It's hard to see you
But do you mind?
I see you hurting
Can't sleep at night
We're all imperfect
We're wrong at times
I just want to make it right

'Cause we are, we are, we are
Fallible Creatures
Enslaved to our secrets
But we are, we are, we are
Forgiving in nature
There's no lesson greater
And though it's hard from time to time
Ignite our souls with this forest fire
'Cause we are, we are, we are
Fallible Creatures
Enslaved to our secrets, oooh
Ohh

Through the fall
I see you as you are
A warrior
Who's proud to bare the scars

It's hard to see you
But do you mind?
I see you hurting
Can't sleep at night
We're all imperfect
We're wrong at times
I just want to make it right

'Cause we are, we are, we are
Fallible Creatures
Enslaved to our secrets
But we are, we are, we are
Forgiving in nature
There's no lesson greater
And though it's hard from time to time
Ignite our souls with this forest fire
'Cause we are, we are, we are
Fallible Creatures
Enslaved to our secrets

We're fragile under the surface
I know it's hard but it's worth it
We're fragile under the surface
I know it's hard, but it's, I know it's hard

'Cause we are, we are, we are
Fallible Creatures
Enslaved to our secrets
But we are, we are, we are
Forgiving in nature
There's no lesson greater
And though it's hard from time to time
Ignite our souls with this forest fire
'Cause we are, we are, we are
Fallible Creatures
Enslaved to our secrets
