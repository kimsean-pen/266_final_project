Space flight and resiliency
Inseparable entities
Fight to get along in the long dead bleak
Some endless journey of discovery (we're on)
Space flight and intimacy
Long responsibility
Boredom spreads like disease
Come take your toll on me
Meant to go to the opposite star
How'd we ever travel out this far?
Architecture of the mind and heart
Sprouting worlds with a diligent arm
Meant to go to the opposite star
The human race is a patient swarm
(Bizarre) architecture of the mind and heart
Tread softly if you have to harm
Space flight and resiliency
Inseparable entities
Like lichen to stone or roots to tree
Do I even have it in me?
Space flight and intimacy
Long responsibility
Can't cut the boredom outta me
Come take your toll
Meant to go to the opposite star
How'd we ever travel out this far?
Architecture of the mind and heart
Sprouting worlds with a diligent arm
Meant to go to the opposite star
The human race is a patient swarm
(Bizarre) architecture of the mind and heart
Tread softly if you have to harm
As phantom limbs of a superpower
We're powerless (Meant to go to the opposite star)
Maybe get a chance to seek my bliss
(The human race is a patient swarm)
After this (Architecture of the mind and heart)
Just make it quick (Tread softly if you have to harm)
