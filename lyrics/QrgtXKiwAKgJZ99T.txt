Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Headin' for the islands
We're ready man and packed to go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
When we hit those islands
There's gonna be a big hello
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Diggin' all the sunshine
It's easy not to say goodbye
Bye Bye Bye

Headin' for the islands
Heyeah, We're really flyin' high
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Walking down the beaches
Tomorrow morning we'll be there
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Golden sandy beaches
And I can smell the breezy air
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

One more celebration
And then we're ready for goodbye
Bye bye bye

Walking down the beaches
Heyeah, We're really flyin' high
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
