All I wanted that summernight
All I wanted from you
All I swore was nowt but love
Now I must live without you
You knocked at my door
You said won't no more
That was you

Come on lady get my heart
You got to paint it black
It's your life that I have lend
Give me all that I want
You knocked at my door
You said that you won't no more
That was you

All I wanted that dream of night
Loving yours in your room
Would've kissed nowt but you my love
Nothing but you
You knocked at my door
You said that you won't no more
That was you
