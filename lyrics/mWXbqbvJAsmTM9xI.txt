I cannot wait for summer
I cannot wait for June
When all the ghosts are quiet
When everything is new

My voice to me, he's always asking for a dance
She said I hate his moves
Hands under her legs, his hands, always in my hand
She said I hate those moves

A scammer whom I see, a clock
Your eyes are closed, its getting dark
Is it over?

I turn my head, I climb the stairs
and try to feel like no ones there
Is it over?

I cannot wait for summer
I cannot wait for June
When all the ghosts are quiet
When everything is new

Her face to me, I see she's asking for a dance
You know, she loves my moves
Her hands around my waist, my arms around her back
You know, she loves my moves

The quiet? moon/room?, the evening draw
I've never felt so wild at all
Is it over?

The boy who sits across from me,
just turns his head and doesn't see, 'till it's...
over
