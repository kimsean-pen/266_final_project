Hee, Hee, Ho, Ho, Ha, Ha, Ha
Bearing gifts like Old Saint Nick
Let me have a sec to pause I ask my clock not to tick
Fee, Fee, Fi, Fi, Fo, Fo, Fum
I'm not here to smell your blood
If we get along no matter who you are I bet you're good

By now I know you probably think I should have told you everything
And explained every thought that I was thinking
Today, this morning, this evening
And if the tune gets too familiar we split our pants
Nuts out refusing to dance
Weddings, parties anything
Something new something old
Throw in something blue, throw in something cold
Stone soup, throw something in the bowl

And a one and a two and a three
Like you and me can see
Surely, it's meant to be
Buzzing around like you know what it's called in that deep blue big blue sky above you
Nothing like dozens of hard boiled golden eggs to give to all your friends
And feed them, you'll feel again
What's coming back to you I believe it's true
It's a, what's it called, a yin-yang aurobouros infinity symbol, woah
We had it right in '99
It was not going to melt down though they told us that they thought it would
And later look at the Mayan calendar thing it makes me sick
It's messed up to scare little kids like we're all gonna die
And then it got even hairier
Stuff got scarier, there's no doubt about it
We are coming into our own I guess
Do our thing, know how to dress
Finally feel me?
'Cept I'm growing up out of my clothes still, I swear
Old man KF up in the prairie zone, drinking his silver sodas one by one
