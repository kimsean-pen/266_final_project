I, tonight I feel like being alone
If you don't mind, if you don't mind
Would you please be so kind
To close the door behind you?

It's been a long, long time
Since I've had this line of doubt out loud

So I, tonight I feel like
I feel like, I feel, baby now

Everybody wants somebody who doesn't want them
Want somebody else, baby
You want somebody? Oh, you want someone
Somebody else, somebody else

Listen now, don't get hurt, don't you get hurt
Don't get hurt, don't you get
Don't get hurt, don't you get hurt
Don't get hurt, don't you get, yeah

A young man is a pulled pin
Looking for a grenade, yeah
A young woman will drive you
Places you never meant to go
But epiphany is such a cliche

Where there's plenty of fish in the wrong sea
Like there's a premium on mystery again
Hold me, distract me, dress me up in bubbles, baby
Save me from the troubles of my own skin now

Everybody wants somebody who doesn't want them
Who want somebody else, baby
You want somebody? Oh, you want someone
Somebody else, somebody else

Listen now, don't get hurt, don't you get hurt
Don't get hurt, don't you get
Don't get hurt, don't you get hurt
Don't get hurt, don't you get

So I, tonight I feel like
I feel like, I feel

Everybody wants somebody who doesn't want them
Who want somebody else, baby
You want somebody? Oh, you want someone
Somebody else, somebody else

Don't get hurt, don't you get hurt
Don't get hurt, don't you get
Don't get hurt, don't you get hurt
Don't get hurt, don't you get
Everybody wants somebody who doesn't want them
Who want somebody else, baby
You want somebody? Oh, you want someone
Somebody else, somebody else
Don't get hurt, don't you get hurt
Don't get hurt, don't you get
Don't get hurt, don't you get hurt
Don't get hurt, don't you get
