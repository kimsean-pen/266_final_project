We are so cold
Searching for shelter
Never to find home

Take me to my grave
You know where I lay

The vessel is empty
No fire remains
Take me, sweet abyss
Take me home

The feeling is gone

She is gone
Away
Please stay

We are so cold
Searching for shelter
Never to find home

All we are is too remain
All we are is doomed to die
