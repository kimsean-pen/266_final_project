Dear, this evening seemed to go so awfully fast
We had so much fun and now you're home at last
I look forward to a kiss or two at the garden gate

But she gave me just a peck and insisted it was late

Give me five minutes more

Only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms

Here am I, begging for
Only five minutes more
Only five minutes more of your charms

All week long I dreamed about our Saturday date
Don't you know that Sunday morning you can sleep late

Give me five minutes more
Only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms
All week long I dreamed about our Saturday date
And don't you know that Sunday morning you can sleep late
Give me five minutes more
Only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay
Stay in your arms
