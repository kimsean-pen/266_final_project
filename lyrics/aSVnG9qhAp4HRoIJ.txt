He used to call me DN
That stood for deadly nightshade
Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back
Reminded me of when we were kids

This is ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

He used to call me poison
Cause I was poison ivy
I could have died right there
Cause Jim was right beside me
Jim raised me up
He hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that
Loving him was never enough

This is ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

We can go back to New York
Cause loving him was really hard
We can go back to town
Heaven don't know who we are
Heaven is on earth
I will do anything for you, babe
Guess it is meant to be
Crying tears of gold, like Adam and Eve

I love you the first time
I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa, comprende these late nights
Cause I'm your jazz singer
And you're my cult leader
I love you forever
I really love you forever

This is ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence
