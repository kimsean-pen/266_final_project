Twisty sidewalks, female taxi drivers
Dirty fingers, pink houses light up

And if there's just one thing
You wanted to see
I suggest you keep looking

Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Find out for once
Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Find out for once
Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Find out for once

Count the bikes, strange violin
Barter price, smoking inside
Stray cat walks, broken English
Chairman's eye, living billions

And if there's just one thing
You wanted to see
I suggest you keep looking

Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Find out for once
Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Find out for once
Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Find out for once

Oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Hm hm
Hm hm hm, hm hm
