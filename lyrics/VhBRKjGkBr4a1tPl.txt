Never thought I'd see the day
That I would be at ease to say
That everything around me is
Exactly as it should be
And any more than what I have
Would be too much for me to feel free
I feel so free

Not wanting to know any more
Than that's been bestowed upon me
I feel so free.

Heart take flight
I give you every right
When he's around
Heart take sight
Don't you forget the light
He brings about

Each time I go to look for him
He's just around the corner
And every time I go to look for him
I feel a little bolder

Not having to ask where or why or
What have you been up to
My faith a little stronger
My wings a little longer

Heart take flight
I give you every right
When he's around
Heart take sight
Don't you forget the light
He brings about
