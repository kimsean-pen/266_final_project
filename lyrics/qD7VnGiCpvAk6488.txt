You have been left alone
The creature of innocence
You lie for what you're worth
And struggle with your confidence

And when your devil complains
And tears you up, to start again
And when you're lying on the stage
And nothing works, just living hurts

Forget, forget
With the secret harmonic emotion
Forget, forget
With the secret harmonic emotion

And so we meet alone
Two players in a puppet show
Don't cry for audience
There's noone that can take you home

And when your devil complains
And tears you up, to start again
And when you're lying on the stage
And nothing works, just living hurts

Forget, forget
With the secret harmonic emotion
Forget, forget
With the secret harmonic emotion
Forget, forget
With the secret harmonic emotion

Forget, forget
With the secret harmonic emotion
Forget, forget
With the secret harmonic emotion
