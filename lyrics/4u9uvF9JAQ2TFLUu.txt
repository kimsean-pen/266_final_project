This is the song I'm too scared to write
But some of you may need it tonight

Oh there you were, heart made of glass
Fragile little thing, shattered too fast
Had to pick the pieces up, up, up
And that's why you first got cut, cut, cut
The devil drew you in, you didn't let it show
Didn't want the others to ever have to know
That you were getting hooked on up, up, up
And all you had to do was cut, cut, cut

You carved a special place for your pain
So it came back to hurt you every night
You closed your eyes and wished it all away
Until you disappeared under the knife

You knew the deal, no one gives a damn
Just another needy kid, sob story in hand
Keep your secrets covered up, up, up
We don't need another cut, cut, cut
But you couldn't hide, a heart made of glass
You pull yourself together with all the strength you had
You were finally fed up, up, up
Finally had to scream enough-nough-nough

You carved a special place for your pain
So it came back to hurt you every night
You closed your eyes and wished it all away
Until you disappeared under the knife

Listen, I know it's simplified from the other side
It's easy to gloss over all the messy reasons why
And it's easy to forget where you've been
I guess that's what the scars are for, huh
When we were 15 we wouldn't dare let that shit be seen
But now it seems mutilations gone mainstream
I see you at my shows, scarred up from head to toe
Like there's no point even trying not to let it show
Cause we all know "Emo kids like to hurt themselves"
Too many feelings, and not enough self control
And I mean does this mess with any of the rest of ya
It's an epidemic yeah we're cool with it don't question it
But it bothers me our scars are currency by which we're measured
Like let the records show who let it slip and who held it together
Cutters and burners and honorable mentions
Posers who cut themselves up for the attention
I don't care your intentions I just want you to know
My self hatred never took me where I wanted to go
At the end of the day, you know I still had to face
But I can pick up the pain, but I can't cut it away
And you know what else I can't do, is give you 10 good reasons not to
I've wracked my brain with clever sayings of all the things you ought to do
But you know I think if there was something I could say
They would've thrown it on a brochure and sent you on your way

So I'll keep doing what I always do
Drag my heart to the piano and make it sing for you
I'll keep doing what I always do
Drag my heart to the piano and let it sing for you

Drag my heart to the piano and let it sing for you
