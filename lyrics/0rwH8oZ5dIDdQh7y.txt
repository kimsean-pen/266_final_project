I got my mind on the money
I don't go gentle, boy, I know
When I go looking it will be money
Now turn the lights down low
I'm looking for gold and cases below
Cash is flowing in my heart
I put my pain away, no time to [?]
I ain't gonna fail in life

Don't give me trouble
I got that million dollar on my mind
Don't give me trouble
I got that million dollar on my mind

My mind, I got that million dollar on my mind
On my, my mind
My mind, I got that million dollar on my mind
On my, my mind

I'm still here, soon I'll be gone
When I get that paper, baby, I will run
I wish my money to be my friend
I don't count each dollar that I spend

Don't give me trouble
I got that million dollar on my mind
Don't give me trouble
I got that million dollar on my mind

My mind, I got that million dollar on my mind
On my, my mind
My mind, I got that million dollar on my mind
On my, my mind
My mind, I got that million dollar
I got that million dollar, baby, on my mind
My mind, I got that million dollar on my mind
On my, my mind

For me it's clear as light that money is mine
For me it's clear as light that money is mine
For me it's clear as light that money is mine
For me it's clear that money is mine, mine, yeah
