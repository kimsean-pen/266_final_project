I said, I'm just a servant to my base desires
She said, I'll tell you a few things, free of charge
Stay clear of jagged rock
Tread careful at the higher level
This ain't no game, but you can play
If that's what you want

Then she said
We are just paper boats bobbing adrift afloat
While winds of fortune shove us where they will
Woke up coughing on the shore
Called out crowd, broke and sore
Back on the mainland
The chimps were comin' up trumps

And all I saw was burning blue
Fading into blonde and white
Wade out past the rotting pier
Out to the open water
Son of a red-roof city
And her, the foreman's daughter

Back on the mainland
Back on the mainland
Cool change was rolling over
Black sky was getting lower
On golden sands

We stared into the haze
Ocean merging with sky
We talked about the land of our fore-mothers
Now that we've shut the gate
It would be funny if it didn't make you want to cry
It's just the bed we've woken up in

And all I saw was burning blue
Fading into blonde and white
Wade out past the rotting pier
Out to the open water
Son of a red-roof city
And her, the foreman's daughter

Back on the mainland
Back on the mainland
Cool change was rolling over
Black sky was getting lower
Green dreams were folding over
As we sailed up the mainland

Never coming on the line
Wake up feeling fine
Eyes on the pale moonlight
Far corner of the earth
Tripping up on the edge
Big impossible now
