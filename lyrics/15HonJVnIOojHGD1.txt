Up in the morning and out to school
Mother says there be no work next year
Qualifications once the Golden Rule
Are now just pieces of paper

Just because you're better than me doesn't mean I'm lazy.
Just because you're going forwards doesn't mean I'm going backwards.

Well if you look the part well then you'll get the job
In last year's trousers and your oldschool shoes
The truth is son it's a buyer's market
They can afford to pick and choose

Just because you're better than me doesn't mean I'm lazy
Just because I dress like this doesn't mean I'm a Communist.

Well the factories are closing and the army's full
I don't know what I'm going to do
But I've come to see in the land of the free
There's only room for a chosen few

Just because you're better than me doesn't mean I'm lazy
Just because you're going forwards doesn't mean I'm going backwards

Well at 21 you're a top of the scrap heap
At 16 you were top of your class
Well I dropped outta high school in Campbell, California
Got a guitar and I never looked back

Just because you're better than me doesn't mean I'm lazy
Just because I dress like this doesn't mean I'm a Communist.
