Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely
When you never coming 'round
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
And then I see the look in your eyes

Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit restless
When I dream of something wild
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit helpless
And I'm like a child in your arms
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit angry
And I know I've got to get out and cry
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
But then I see the look in your eyes

Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line
Love is like a shadow on me all of the time

I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
Living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
Now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
If you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
We'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time

I don't know what to do, I'm always in the dark
Living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
(Forever's gonna start tonight)

Once upon a time I was falling in love
Now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart

A total eclipse of the heart
