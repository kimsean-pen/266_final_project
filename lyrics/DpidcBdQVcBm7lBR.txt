Babe, I woke up and I, watched the snow fall from my sky
Babe, I woke up and I, felt a tear slip from my eye
Babe, I woke up and I, wished for just another night
No-no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no
Babe, I can hardly breathe without you right next to me
Babe, I can hardly breathe, who'll carry my christmas tree?
Babe, I can hardly breathe, wish I hadn't let you leave
No-no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no
Oh, it's so chilly without you near me
My everyday Santa Claus
So baby come quickly
You're starting to leave me
I need my old Santa Claus
Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I got to shoot through
I got to shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?
Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I got to shoot through
I got to shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?
Babe, I woke up solo, wished i hadn't let you go
Babe, I woke up solo, saw your footsteps in the snow
Babe, I woke up solo, loved you so, I loved you so
No-no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no
Oh, it's so chilly without you near me
My everyday Santa Claus
So baby come quickly
You're starting to leave me
I need my old Santa Claus
Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I got to shoot through
I got to shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?
Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I got to shoot through
I got to shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?
Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I got to shoot through
I got to shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
