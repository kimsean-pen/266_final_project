It was still dark
It was still snowing
We were the only ones
In a pre-natal snowglobe

When our time's up
We'll carry on
Like smoke after the fire's gone

From the top of Burger Hill, I see
Smoke that leaves through the chimneys
The world is untouched and set free
The way it was meant to be

I woke up too fast from a dream
And I'm running with me
Outside, the moonlight catches the ice
Like clay, it tricks the eyes

When our time comes
We'll pass through
Like the wind blows through the trees

From the top of Burger Hill, I see
Smoke that leaves through the chimneys
The world is untouched and set free
The way it was meant to be

A hill the size of the steps you'll take
In a lifetime
