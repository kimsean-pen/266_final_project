I'mma never slow down 'til I'm in my hearse
Can't tell if I'm blessed or if I'm cursed
But I move along, wanna sing my song
'Cos I know my words
Said I'm gonna walk down but I know my worth
Yeah, I know my worth
Baby, it was so simple
Just a couple of years ago I would roam wherever the wind blow
I was living with no cares, now I got nightmares
As soon as my eyes close
Am I losing my soul?

Nostalgia lied to me once again
Making me believe
That everything that happened back then, was all so easy
Sometimes I reminisce on things that I miss
But I know that they're not real
Nostalgia lied to me once again
Making me want to go back

And my mind on the Hollywood mills
House in the Hollywood hills, how many gotta get killed?
I'm on them Hollywood pills, yeah
Remember when I was a kid, yeah, I wasn't scared of shit
Wishing I could go back now
When my worries and fears were all in the background
Having troubled all my life now
'Cos if I can read of all the things I haven't seen today
There's no way that it could be the same

Nostalgia lied to me once again
Making me believe
That everything that happened back then, was all so easy
Sometimes I reminisce on things that I miss
But I know that they're not real
Nostalgia lied to me once again
Making me want to go back
