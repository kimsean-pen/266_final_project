Its late in the day, im thinking of you, the things that you say
so long
so long for me

Its late in the day, im talking to you
hear what i say
so long
so long for me

all the time i thought of you
in an ordinary way

all i really have to say
is please dont pass along the way
as thoughts of you and me again

i lay on my bed
searching my mind
writing my love
so long
so long for me

i sleep on the road
dream of a sound
coming my way
so long
so long for me

all the time i thought of you
in an ordinary way

?
and all i really have to say
is please dont pass along the way
the thoughts of you and me again

oooooooo

and all the time i thought of you
in an ordianry way
you slept right down the hallway?

and all i really have to say
is please dont pass along the way
i close my eyes and turn away

and all time i think of you
in an ordinary day
you drift right down the hallway
and all i really have to say
is please dont pass along the way
the thoughts of you and me again...
