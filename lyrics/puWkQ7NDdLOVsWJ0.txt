Maybe I don't mind
Just getting high in mine
We're shouting over music
With a friend who's like a brother
Cause if I get time
I just regret most shit

From every hangover my head feels
To every ex I didn't treat right
To every Monday I call in sick
To every argument I let slide

Christ, I ain't ever going back to thinking straight
Cause twice, twice it brought me down
But it's the last time

Maybe I'll grow tired
Of you bitching all the time
Cause when you love the way you're living
It's hard to fret about much
Cause if I get time
I just regret most of it

From every hangover my head feels
To every ex I didn't treat right
To every Monday I call in sick
To every argument I let slide

Christ, I ain't ever going back to thinking straight
Cause twice, twice it brought me down
But it's the last time

From every hangover my head feels
To every ex I didn't treat right
To every Monday I call in sick
To every argument I let slide

Christ, I ain't ever going back to thinking straight
Cause twice, (yeah, twice)
Twice it brought me down
But it's the last time
