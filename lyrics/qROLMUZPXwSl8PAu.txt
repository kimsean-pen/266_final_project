Right now

I am an antichrist
And I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want
But I know how to get it
I wanna destroy passerby
'Cause I wanna be Anarchy

No dog's body

Anarchy from the U.K.
It's coming sometime and maybe
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic line
Your future dream is a shopping scheme
'Cause I
I wanna be anarchy

In this city

How many ways to get what you want
I use the best
I use the rest
I use the N.M.E.
I use anarchy
'Cause I wanna be anarchy

It's the only way to be

Is this the M.P.L.A.?
Or is this the U.D.A.?
Or is this the I.R.A.?
I thought it was the U.K.
Or just another country
Another council tenacy

I wanna be anarchy
And I wanna be anarchy

Oh what a name!

And I wanna be an anarchist
I get pissed destroy!
