I'm bouncing off the walls again, woah oh
And I'm looking like a fool again, woah oh
I threw away my reputation
One more song for the radio station

I'm bouncing off the walls again, woah oh
And I'm looking like a fool again, woah oh
Waking up on the bathroom floor
Pull myself back together just to fall once more

And my heart's beating out of my chest, woah oh
And this town is still making me sick, woah oh
And every penny from my last paycheck
I've blown it on you

I'm bouncing off the walls again, woah oh
And I'm looking like a fool again, woah oh
So go ahead and take a picture
And hang it up so you can tear me down

I don't care, woah oh oh oh
Cause I'm still, here woah oh oh oh
And I've got nothing left to lose
With all the years I've wasted on you

Go! Go! Go!

Mommy and Daddy's got the best cocaine
Ritalin's never gonna feel the same
Twenty-four hours on an empty brain
I got my finger on the trigger and you're in my way

I'm bouncing off the walls again, woah oh
And I'm looking like a fool again, woah oh
I threw away my reputation
One more song for the radio station
I'm bouncing off the walls again, woah oh
And I'm looking like a fool again, woah oh
I'm bouncing off the walls again, woah oh
And I'm looking like a fool again
I'm bouncing off the walls again
