Waiting here

A heart full of love
A heart full of song
I'm doing everything all wrong
Oh God, for shame
I do not even know your name
Dear Madamoiselle
Won't you say?
Will you tell?

A heart full of love
No fear, no regret
My name is Marius Pontmercy
And mine's Cosette
Cosette, I don't know what to say
Then make no sound
I am lost
I am found!

A heart full of love
(He was never mine to lose)
A heart full of you
(Why regret what cannot be?)
A single look and then I knew
I knew it too
(These are words he'll never say, not to me)
From today
(Not to me, not for me)

Every day
(His heart full of love)
For it isn't a dream
Not a dream after all
(He will never feel this way)
