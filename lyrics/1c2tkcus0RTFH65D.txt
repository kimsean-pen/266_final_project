Let the lights dim some more
Niggas barely leave the crib no more, I
Hit the liquor till my system warp
This a fast life
Crash course, I
Ride around in the night
Dark skies bright light
This dash hit a hundred
Quick beast I be runnin' with
Eat beats ain't nothing to me
I swear it ain't nothing to me
I'm alive in the night
Good vibe Good time
It's half past midnight
Too up, too high I'm along for the ride
Won't crash till daylight

Just hold on tight, don't loose your grip
Our innocence gone with the wind
Fast car, fast girl
We live for this
Can't fall, can't slip
Pedal to medal I rev it, I get it in

I'm a night
I'm a night crawler
I'm a night
I'm a night crawler
Let it rip push it down yeah
Vroom, vroom
When I touch the town
I'm a night
I'm a night crawler

It look like Gotham out here
You don't want no problems out here
I hop in that Murdered, I know that you heard it
Was put too much work around here
Ride around in the night no twelve in sight
This dash hit a hundred
Quick speed down the runway
Switch gear it ain't nothing to me
I swear it ain't nothing to me
I'm alive in the night
Good vibe, good time
It's half past midnight
Too up, too high I'm along for the ride
Won't crash till daylight
Just hold on tight don't loose your grip
Our innocence gone with the wine
Fast car, fast girl
We live for this
Can't fall can't slip
Pedal to medal I rev it, I get in it

I'm a night
I'm a night crawler
I'm a night
I'm a night crawler
Let it rip push it down yeah
Vroom, vroom
When I touch the town
I'm a night
I'm a night crawler

Don't crash on me
Don't crash on me
No rest for the wicked ooh
Come dance with me
Come dance with me
No rest for the wicked ooh

I'm a night
I'm a night crawler
I'm a night
I'm a night crawler
Let it rip push it down yeah
Vroom, vroom
When I touch the town
I'm a night
I'm a night crawler
