Feeling of despair
After you have gone
I'm thinking and i wonder
What i should have done

I close my eyes
Even though i'm in love
I'm cold as ice
I feel it's time to let go

You sent me a letter
Without no reply
I wish i would be better
But i'm too shy

You are so fine
And i'm thinking
About you all the time
I want to rise up
And shine like the sun
I want to say
"come to me 'cause i won't run"
I feel it's time to let go

You are so fine
And i'm thinking
About you all the time
And i will rise up
And shine like the sun
And i will say
"come to me 'cause i won't run"
I know it's time to let go
