Just because we've gone away
Here's a message from me and Ray
We're not gonna let the music die
Join us if you've got the energy

We're the proud, the few
Descendents rockin' alone tonight
We're the proud, the few
Descendents pickin' our butts tonight

We're looking for a few good men
Degenerates need not apply
Attitude is a must
On our endless quest
To play hard, play fast
You must sacrifice
Nothing else will suffice
Pay the price

We never did a popular thing
Don't even know how to sing
Couldn't sell out a telephone booth
What I'm telling you is the truth

We're the proud, the few
Descendents rockin' alone tonight
We're the proud, the few
Descendents pickin' our butts tonight

We're looking for a few good men
Degenerates need not apply
Attitude is a must
On our endless quest
To play hard, play fast
You must sacrifice
Nothing else will suffice
Pay the price

We're the proud, the few
Descendents rockin' alone tonight
We're the proud, the few
Descendents pickin' our butts tonight

We're looking for a few good men
Degenerates need not apply
Attitude is a must
On our endless quest
To play hard, play fast
You must sacrifice
Nothing else will suffice
Pay the price
