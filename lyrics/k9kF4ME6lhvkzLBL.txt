This creation of doubt won't hold back

Lulled by safety
Lured into these acts
Caught and suffocated but refusing to expand from that
Passionate
Seared into the past
Unavoidable, laid bare to caution

There is no forgiveness here

You'll find it's not all what it seems
So pinch to feel the pain
Clawing for a sweet escape
Until I feel again

You'll find it's not all what it seems
So pinch to feel the pain
Blessed to feel the sweet escape
Until I fall again

One waste to cause wreckage
Nothing can restore
But will I ever overcome all that has gone before?

You'll find it's not all what it seems
So pinch to feel the pain
Clawing for a sweet escape
Until I feel again

You'll find it's not all what it seems
So pinch to feel the pain
Blessed to feel the sweet escape
Until I'm born again
