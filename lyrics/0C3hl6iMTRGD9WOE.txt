No escape, there is no way out
Of this constructed existence
A created image of untrue conception
You cannot find the real you

Manipulated a hyped invention
Who is this false identity?
The ideal person, perfect role model
Beneath you can feel the cracks

Now your nerves begin to break
You're losing your grip, now it's too late
Perceive this - no fallacy
This icon faces insanity

On the verge of mental breakdown
Forgotten realms of madness are found
Now you face the final curtain
You future life is now uncertain
