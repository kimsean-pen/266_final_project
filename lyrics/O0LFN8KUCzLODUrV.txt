I've seen fire and I've seen rain.
I've seen sunny days I thought would never end.
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend.
But I always thought that I'd see you agian.

Just yesterday mornin' they let me know that you were gone.
Seems them plans they'd made put an end to you.
I walked out this mornin' and I wrote down this song.
I just can't remember who to send it to.

I've seen fire and I've seen rain.
I've seen sunny days I thought would never end.
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend.
But I always thought that I'd see you again.

Oh, look down upon me, Jesus.
You gotta help me make a stand.
You just gotta see me through to another day.
My body's achin' and my time is at hand.
And I won't make it any other way.

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain.
I've seen sunny days I thought would never end.
I've seen lonely times when I could not find me a friend.
But I always thought that I'd see you again.

I've been walking my mind to an easy time,
Back turned towards the sun.
Lord knows when the cold wind blows
It'll turn your head around.
There's hours of time on the telephone line
Talkin' about things to come.
Sweet dreams and flyin' machines
In pieces on the ground.

I've seen fire and I've seen rain.
I've seen sunny days I thought would never end.
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend.
But I always thought that I'd see you again.

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain.
I've seen sunny days I thought would never end.
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend.
