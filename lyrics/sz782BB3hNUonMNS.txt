If I told you the truth, It would be a lie

Be damned, don't you dare
I'll be laughing from here to there
Just because something's popular
Don't mean it's good

I'd like to be your drink
I'll help you talk
I'll help you think

Deal with it
I cheated on test

Hiding what we want to do
Smart people will learn from fools
Life is like a hurricane
Crosswords on the asteroid game
Depressed and stressed and oppressed
Lies are simple, truth complex
Snakes with venom
Ones with none
Ones who bite you just for fun

The horror of being awaken
Temporarily see the madness of the life

Deal with it
If I told you the truth It would be lie

Deal with it
If I told you the truth it would be lie

Hiding what they want to do
Is it me or is it you?
Dead lights comforting someone
Occupy the Washington
Sometimes it's easier to cry
Than try to figure out why
Fight for ungrateful grandchildren
In the future there's no sun

And I'm sorry that, sorry that
Sorry that I can't forget
And I'm sorry that, sorry that
Sorry that I can't forget
And I'm sorry that, sorry that
Sorry that I can't forget

Did my joy break like a toy?
Tell me what we're fighting for

When did my dreams tear at the seams?
Put me on a different team

And I'm sorry that, sorry that
Sorry that I can't forget
