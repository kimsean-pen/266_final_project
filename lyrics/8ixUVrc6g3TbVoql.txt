We bet on our lives and we bet on the horses
In that upstairs apartment on Orlando and fourth
And the rent was due and the rent man was knockin'
Like a Chinese proverb we were always searchin'
Nightlife's a no win but nobody noticed
How we killed off the bottles lookin' good on the surface
The dog days barked and the house cat got old
We were Bonnie and Clyde in the Emperor's new clothes
And the tears never came, they just stayed in our eyes
We refused to admit that we wore this disguise
Every inch of us growin' like Pinocchio's nose
As we walked around in the Emperor's new clothes
We flew by our wits and by the seat of our pants
In the state of illusion in the nation of chance
And the repo was hauling the wreck we'd been drivin'
As the dashboard Madonna smiled back at us kindly
We cheated the system never batting an eyelid
Seeing only the good through the holes in our shoes
And our halos were rusty but we wore them proudly
We were two little Gods in the Emperor's new clothes
And the tears never came, they just stayed in our eyes
We refused to admit that we wore this disguise
Every inch of us growin' like Pinocchio's nose
As we walked around in the Emperor's new clothes
And we were Bonnie and Clyde in the Emperor's new clothes
And the tears never came, they just stayed in our eyes
We refused to admit that we wore this disguise
Every inch of us growin' like Pinocchio's nose
As we walked around in the Emperor's new clothes
Emperor's new clothes
Emperor's new clothes, yeah
