Out beyond the threshold
In worlds yet known to man
Lurking near the portal's gate
Where black holes burn away
VENIT MORS TE SUPERARE
BONUM EST MORTIS MEDITARI
Dimensions shattered by tombs of time
Collapse the galaxy on human life
Outside they wait to cloud the gateway

(solo - Kolotyrsky)

From beyond I see the nothing
The field which chains all being

(solo - Reidl)
