In the name of the future
Confused the angel beholds the master
The little people are coming for me
Behold the curse of mortality

In the name of the future
Death to the world - Death to the world

In the name of the future
Confused the prophet beholds his disaster
The man inbetween is looking for me
Destroyed in the end I ceased to be

In the name of the future
Death to the world - Death to the world
This world is a will to power
This world is a will to power

"I used to be the God of the heavenly children
Playing wicked games in the garden of Eden
But their apple went rotten down to the core
So with hands outstretched they begged for more
Then I gave them the Messiah to teach them the Word
He was born like a butterfly... died like a worm
My kingdom rusted - The heavens burned
So now I sit here watching the end of the world"

In the name of the future
Confused the angel beholds the master
The little people are coming for me
Behold the curse of mortality

In the name of the future
Death to the world - Death to the world
This world is a will to power
This world is a will to power
