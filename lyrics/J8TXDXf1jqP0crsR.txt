I don't wanna go another day
So I'm telling you
Exactly what is on my mind
Seems like everybody's breaking up
And throwing their love away
But I know I got a good thing right here
That's why I say, hey

Nobody gonna love me better
I'ma stickwitu forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'ma stickwitu

You know how to appreciate me
I'ma stickwitu, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'ma stickwitu

I don't wanna go another day
So I'm telling you
Exactly what is on my mind
See the way we ride in our private lives
Ain't nobody getting in between
I want you to know
That you're the only one for me
And I say

Nobody gonna love me better
I'ma stickwitu forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'ma stickwitu

You know how to appreciate me
I'ma stickwitu, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'ma stickwitu

And now
Ain't nothing else I could need
And now
I'm singing 'cause you're so, so into me
I got you
We'll be making love endlessly
I'm with you
Baby, you're with me

So don't you worry about
People hanging around
They ain't bringing us down
I know you and you know me
And that's all that counts

So don't you worry about
People hanging around
They ain't bringing us down
I know you and you know me
And that's, that's why I say, hey

Nobody gonna love me better
I'ma stickwitu forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'ma stickwitu

You know how to appreciate me
I'ma stickwitu, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
