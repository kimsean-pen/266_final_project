Huh, yeah, naw I just, I don't know baby, bit too much of Hennessy
Gonna tell you how I feel, (Look)

You so fucking precious when you smile (smile, yeah)
Hit it from the back and drive you wild (wild), oh yeah
Girl, I lose myself up in those eye eye eye eye eyes
I just had to let you know you're mine (mine)

Hands on your body
I don't wanna waste no time (time)
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, (mine) I can't look away, I just gotta say

I'm so fucking happy you're alive (live)
Swear to God I'm down
If you're down all you gotta say is right (right)
Girl, girl anything I can do just to make you feel alright (alright)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I just had to let you know you're fine (fine)
Running circles 'round my mind
Even when it's rainy all you ever do is shine
You on fire (you on fire), you a star just like Mariah
Man this feel incredible
I'll turn you into a bride, you're mine (mine)

Hands on your body, (body) I don't wanna waste no time (time)
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine (mine), I can't look away, I just gotta say
