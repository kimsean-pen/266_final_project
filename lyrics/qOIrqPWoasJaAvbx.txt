Blindness feeds the war to madness
faith's crumbling there's no doubt about it
religion and science fighting a new kind of war

Helpless - wander the streets in desperation
fearless - to the path they tread
shameless - the powers that butcher
ignorant - to the deeds that they commit

When all is said and done
heaven lies in my heart
no slave to beliefs that propagate pain
when all is said and done
heaven lies in our hearts
this life is a gift to be lived & loved

Fracturing the structure of nature
iconic catalysts to slaughter
a stalemate bursting bound by contradictions

Heartless - divine blueprints of hatred
selfless - diseased master plans
shameless - the powers that butcher
ignorant - to the deeds that they commit

When all is said and done
heaven lies in my heart
no slave to beliefs that propagate pain
when all is said and done
heaven lies in our hearts
this life is a gift to be lived and loved

Decoded treachery shielding the tyranny
black bible tyrants behind masks of righteousness
relentless - the onslaught of misunderstanding
descending into a unified chaos

One more chance for a shot at redemption
lost within, can we summon the might

When all is said and done
heaven lies in my heart
no slave to beliefs that propagate pain
when all is said and done
heaven lies in our hearts
this life is a gift to be lived & loved
