I can't stand to let you win
I'm just watching you
And I don't know what to do

Feeling like a fool inside
Feeling all the loved you hide
Thought you were my friend
Seems it never ends

I need somebodySomeone
Can't somebody help me?
I don't need it to be
Love, just for me

Giving you with this and that
Give and get nothing back
It's all related to
All the things I do

Feeling like a fool inside
Seeing all the things you tried
I am nothing

I need somebodySomeone
Can't somebody help me?
I don't need it to be
Love, just for me

I look
I sign
I need someone
Inside to help me out

With what
I'm trying
I'm crying
I'm prying
In a pile of
Shit
I'm dying
I'm dying
I'm dying
I need somebody
(Someone)
Somebody
(Somebody)
Someone
I need somebody
(Someone)
Somebody
(Somebody)
Someone
Someone
