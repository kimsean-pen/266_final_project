my friend you are unique but not always
some stranger in the well has surely felt your pain
someone you've never met might even own your name
and said all the things you've once said
your thoughts exist in someone else's head

it's true you are one of my favorite books to read
i have to thank you now, you've changed the way i think
and with each page i turn, there you are
and with each word i read rings true in my heart

while i was waiting i found something i was missing
might not have been a man, but where we still could live on wishing

please don't confuse me with your devastating stare-downs
i'll hold your mirror all you have to do is turn around
so you can see the face you make as you are giving out your soul
are you the only one who doesn't already know

i used to think i was the only one
i used to think i was the only one
i used to think i was the only one
but i've learned quite a few things since then
and i guess no one ever really is the only one

my friend if it's alive, it will do anything
and if it's strong believe it will go there
and if it's full of love, know it is capable of
emptying itself out at any point at all
just know the height you reach is the distance you could fall

i am aware i'm not the one who's worth most of your time
i am not well and you could be surprised at what you find

i used to think i was the only one
i used to think i was the only one
i used to think i was the only one
but i've learned quite a few things since then
and i guess no one ever really is the only one

how dare you think you are the only one
how do you think you are the only one
i used to think i was the only one
but i've learned quite a few things since then
and i guess no one ever really is the only one
