Don't ask me for advice
I'll give it to you every time
Open up and let the forest fire
Destroy everything in sight

It's not that I'm exceptional
I only want to speak aloud
Pull out all the tangled thoughts
And try to sort all them out somehow

I know, I know the key
It's written in my own body
It's hidden in my own body
From her to you and you to me

I'd like to estimate how many drown in compliments
Given like a consolation prize
That's yours, you can be admired

Given the choice I'd press pause
And play it all back in reverse
And then I'd laugh at how curious
The mirror is

I know, I know the key
It's written in my own body
It's hidden in my own body
It's written in my own body

I know, I know the key
It's written in my own body
It's hidden in my own body
From her to you and you to me
