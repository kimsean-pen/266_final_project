There's gasoline in your heart
There's fire in mine
I know I'm never gunna light you
But there's always night time

There's a light I've found in your eyes,
That I've never found in mine
I know I, I could never ever show you
But there's always night time - (Knowing no-one to someone)

I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time

There's gasoline in your heart
I could have your fire
I know that this is momentary

Imagine it's night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time

Can you feel?
Can you feel?

I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time
I wish it wasn't just the night time
