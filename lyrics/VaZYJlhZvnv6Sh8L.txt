I did what I did because I wanted to
And it felt so good at that altitude
So I set free what I kept inside
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide

I was wrong and I know
It burns as bad as it shows
I've thought it out and I've got no explanation
But I don't know what to say
A lie would get in the way
I did what I did
I did what I did because I wanted to

I did what I did 'cause I wanted to
How can I fix what I can't undo?
And I don't expect you to sympathize
Seeing your pain in our goodbye
Trying to change what I can't hide

I was wrong and I know
It burns as bad as it shows
I've thought it out and I've got no explanation
But I don't know what to say
A lie would get in the way
I did what I did
I did what I did because I wanted to
I did what I did because I wanted to

Why would I stay in
When I can go downtown?
Why keep delayin'
What I know is right?
Now I can't deny

I was wrong and I know
It burns as bad as it shows
I've thought it out and I've got no explanation
I don't know what to say
A lie would get in the way
I did what I did
I did what I did because I wanted to
I did what I did because I wanted to
I did what I did because I wanted to
I did what I did because I wanted to
