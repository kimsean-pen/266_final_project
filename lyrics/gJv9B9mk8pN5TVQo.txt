So goddamn long, we've been searching
Why has it taken so long
An open mind is a weapon
Loaded and keeping it strong

The answer might be a question
Got my sights set to kill
Never asking for permission
We always do, as we will

One shot kill
One shot kill
One shot kill
One shot kill
Kill!

Undercover infiltration
The target has been secured
The destiny of a nation
Identity confirmed

Calling for action, we know just what to do
Deadly extraction, the body count, not few
And through the blood shed, the innocence consumed
There's no place to hide, our sights are set on you

One bird is wounded, how bad we can't tell
Secure the compound and gather intel
The clock is ticking, our mission is clear
Nothing can ever stop Neptune's spear

So goddamn long, we've been searching
'Cause what he did was so wrong
He couldn't hide behind deception
No longer run from us all

The final step of the mission
We got the green light to kill
The target's now in position
Shoot, fire at will

One shot kill
One shot kill
One shot kill
One shot kill
