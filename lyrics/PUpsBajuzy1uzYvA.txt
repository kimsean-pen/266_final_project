Arose from the ashes
The remains of a time set aside
The warrior of Eden
Bound by honor when two worlds collide

On and on and on
With glory he came, he saw he conquered

He gathered his armies
True elite sqauds, the templar's of steel
They sought out the dragon
Made the enemy bleed, made them kneel

On and on and on
A legend Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken
On and on and on
A story is born, a legacy reborn

Hammer high, to the sky
Follow the warrior and king
Call out Hector's hymn
Hammer high, amplify
Hail to the warrior
Call out Hector's hymn

Alone came the thunder
And the hero was set to return
With hearts fueled by fire
Our spirits will now set to burn

On and on and on
The fire and the fame will burn forever
Still guarded by templar's
All the secrets of steel will remain
Cause we are the keepers
And for us this is real not a game

On and on and on
We followed his lead, we came we conquered
On and on and on
Together we fight, together we will fall

Hammer high to the sky
Follow the warrior and king
Call out Hector's hymn
Hammer high, amplify
Hail to the warrior
Call out Hector's, call out Hector's hymn

Oh, oh...

Oh, oh...

Hammer high, to the sky
Follow the warrior and king
Call out Hector's hymn
Hammer high, amplify
Hail to the warrior
Call out Hector's, call out Hector's hymn
