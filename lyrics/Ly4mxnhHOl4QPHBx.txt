I thought you put me in rapture
I never asked you to dump her
Thought you knew we'd have a high life

And still I see
Your philosophy
Falling through my tainted mind
Would you dig my dirt?
Cause I'm so desperate
Can't you see you're wasting time
It ain't ever gonna feel this good honey
I failed to tell you, to tell you now

That I've been fooled
'Cause I'm not cool
And scissors slide
Away with my pride

Speeding down a dead-end track
I wanted you there's no way back
Got a destructive appetite

Baby please
Lift me off my knees
A little smile can go for miles
I may be young
But I will grow up strong
And by then she'll look like her mum
It ain't ever gonna feel this good honey
I failed to tell you, to tell you now

That I've been fooled
'Cause I'm not cool
And scissors slide
Away with my pride

Just to be absolutely sure of the facts
I'm happy to act just as a side salad
Happy to act
Happy to pay
Happy to wait
Baby you're great
When your oven goes ping
I'll be there on your plate
When your oven goes ping
I'll be there on your plate
When your oven goes ping
I'll be there on your plate
When your oven goes ping
I'll be there on your plate
When her oven goes bang...

I've been fooled
'Cause I'm not cool
And scissors slide
Away with my pride
