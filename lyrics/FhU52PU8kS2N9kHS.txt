Cradle me
I'll cradle you
I'll win your heart

With a with a woop-a-wooh
Pulling shapes just for your eyes

So with toothpaste kisses and lines
I'll be yours and you'll be
Lay with me, I'll lay with you

We'll do the things that lovers do
Put the stars in our eyes
And with heart shaped bruises
And late night kisses
Divine
