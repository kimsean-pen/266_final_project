I spend the afternoon in cars
I sit in traffic jams for hours
Don't push me
I am not OK

The sky is blue most every day
The lemons grow like tumors they
Are tiny suns infused with sour

Lonely as a cloud
In the Golden State
"The coldest winter that I ever saw
Was the summer that I spent..."

The only substance is the fog
And it hides all that has gone wrong
Can't see a thing
Inside the maze

There is a bridge adored and famed
The Golden spine of engineering
Whose back is heavy
With my weight

Be still this old heart
Be still this old skin
Drink your last drink
Sin your last sin
Sing your last song
About the beginning
Sing it out* loud
So the people can hear
Let's Go
Be still this sad day
Be still this sad year
Hope your last hope
Fear you last fear
You're not the only one
Let's Go

My falling shape will draw a line
Between the blue of sea and sky
I'm not a bird
I'm not a plane

I took the taxi to the gate
I will not go to school again
Four seconds was
The longest wait
