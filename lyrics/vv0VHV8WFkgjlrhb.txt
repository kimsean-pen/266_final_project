Wide awake, wide awake
It all gets so hard
Wide awake, wide awake
It all gets so hard

Would you take my hand and make a shadow?
Would you take my hand and make a shadow?

A little, I want to be a kid again
Little, don't tell me this is home.

I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows!
I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows!
My heart is fire!
My heart is young!
I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows!

Run away, run away
Let's sleep tomorrow
Run away, run away
Let's sleep tomorrow

Where the city floats we'll build our castle
Where the city floats we'll build our castle

A little, I want to be a kid again
Little, don't tell me this is home

I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows!
I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows!
My heart is fire!
My heart is young!
I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows!
We gotta wake inside this shadow
Don't get old, don't get old!
We gotta wake inside this shadow
Don't get old, don't get old!
We gotta wake inside this shadow
Don't get old, don't get old!
I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows!
I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows!
My heart is fire!
My heart is young!
I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows!
