Megalithic and ancient
Of unknown origin
The long dead disciples
Their bones now dust
And scattered in the wind

These fragments of a soul
Like specks of sentient will
Black matter fills the void
Of all that can be killed

Blankfaced enigma
Nurturing stars
Residual carbon
Is all that we are

At first there is nothing
And then it unfolds
Evolves into something
No one can control
The ones who forgot us
When the dam finally broke
Were longing for silence
When the universe spoke

The eloquence in sadness
Of uncompromised loss
From a temporal riptide
To a cancerous growth
As all the lines are crossed

Time is the immortal continuum
Death is this subconscious design
The relentless scavenger of galaxies
Will not cease or devolve

Blankfaced enigma
Nurturing stars
Residual carbon
Is all that we are

At first there is nothing
And then it unfolds
Evolves into something
No one can control
The ones who forgot us
When the dam finally broke
Were longing for silence
When the universe spoke

Deflect to the warship
Cease and desist
The ones that we fought for
Are no longer missed

No
At first there is nothing
And then it unfolds
Evolves into something
No one can control
The ones who forgot us
When the dam finally broke
Were longing for silence
When the universe spoke
