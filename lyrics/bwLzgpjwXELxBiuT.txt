Remember who we are supple and new
If I lose my way you'd tell me the truth for all it's worth
Lifting up your hand show me my rescue
When I said, truth is worth more than pride
Truth is worth more than pride
Everything you do continues long after you've gone
Circle overhead the view from the bed
So high and lonely
Sixteen times a day he comes to ground
to get some attention
What I said, truth is worth more than pride
Truth, it cannot be denied
Truth is worth more than pride
They have showered me with riches
And they say that I am worthy of their love
and their attention
But they still don't know the truth
Everything you do continues long after you've gone
What I said, truth is worth more than pride
Truth cannot be denied
Truth is worth more than pride
The view from the bed so high and lonely
So high and lonely
Truth is worth more than pride, hey hey...
View from the bed, so high and lonely, so high and lonely
