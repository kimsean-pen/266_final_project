Working your fingers to the bone
Driving you mad you should have known
Wrap it up baby I'm taking you home
Get off the floor, I want you alone
Take just a little bit of time
Just to make you feel right
Just enough to ease the vibe, hit the line

You've got pressure dripping off your shoulders
Let me be the one to relieve it
Let's get unprofessional don't you know
It's gonna feel much better with

Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Is what you need

Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Is what you need

Feelin' the tension
Feelin' the stress
I got a motion I wanna confess
Lookin' so good when your hair is a mess
I'm tearing the buttons right off of your dress
I'm working you over time
I'm getting you over the line
I'm climbing your ladder
And making you badder cause it's what you need

You've got pressure dripping off your shoulders
Let me be the one to relieve it
Let's get unprofessional dont you know
It's gonna feel much better with

Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Is what you need

Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Is what you need

Just a little bit
Just a little bit
just a little bit
Just a little

Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Is what you need

Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Is what you need

Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Is what you need

Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Is what you need
