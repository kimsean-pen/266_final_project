Yea, yea
Oh ohh, yeaaa

I've got it all
but I feel so deprived
I go up I come down, and I'm emptier inside
tell me what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing
and why can't I let it go

There's gotta be more to life
than chasing down every temporary high
to satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm
tripping out thinking there must be more to life
Well it's life but I'm sure
there's gotta be more
Than wanting more

I've got the time and I'm wasting it slowly
Here in this moment I'm half way out the door
Onto the next thing, I'm searching for something that's missing

There's gotta be more to life...
Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me
Cause the more that I'm...
Tripping out thinking there must be more to life
Well it's life, but I'm sure... there's gotta be more...
I'm wanting more...

I'm always waiting on something other than this
Why am I feelin' like there's something I missed...

There's gotta be more to life...
Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me
Cause the more that I'm...
Tripping out thinking there must be more to life
Well it's life, but I'm sure... there's gotta be more to life...

Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me
Cause the more that I'm...
Tripping out thinking there must be more to life
Well it's life, but I'm sure... there's gotta be more to life... life.
ohh... more to... more to... more to life
There's gotta be more to life
ohh... more to life... theres gotta be more to life... ohhh
