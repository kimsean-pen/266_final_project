It's a little cold outside tonight
but i was too close not to say hi
You know i talked to a friend of your's at school
She gave me the impression that you might be cool

With a guy like me
With a girl like you
Oh, could you ever see
A guy like me with a girl like you

Am I a fool for fool for falling for you girl?
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Am I a fool for fool for making you my whole world
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Please don't break it
Please don't break it

Cause all along it's been you on my mind
Something special about you
Is hard to find
I know every girl's searching for romance
And i'm wondering
If you would take a chance
On a guy like me with a girl like you
Oh, could you ever see

A guy like me with a girl like you
Like you, like you!

Am I a fool for fool for falling for you girl?
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Am I a fool for fool for making you my whole world
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Please don't break it
Please don't break it

I'm a fool for you Cheyenne
I'm a fool for you Cheyenne
I'm a fool for you Cheyenne
I ain't playing
I just say it
I can't live without you
Ooh, ooh

Am I a fool for fool for falling for you girl?
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Am I a fool for fool for making you my whole world
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Please don't break it
Please don't break it.
