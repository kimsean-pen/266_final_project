Well, the name she gave was Caroline
The daughter of a miner
An' her ways were free, an' it seemed to me
That sunshine walked beside her

She comes from Spencer, across the hill
She said her pa had sent her
'Cause the coal was low and soon the snow
Would turn the skies to winter

Well, she said, she'd come to look for work
She was not seekin' favors
For a dime a day and a place to stay
She'd turn those hands to labor

The times were hard, Lord and the jobs were few
All through Tecumseh valley
But she asked around till a job she found
Tending bar at Gypsy Sally's

Well, she saved enough to get back home
When spring replaced the winter
But her dreams were denied, her pa had died
Well, the word come down from Spencer

So she turned to whorin' out on the streets
With all the lust inside her
And it was many a man, returned again
To lay himself beside her

Well, they found her down beneath the stairs
That led to Gypsy Sally's
And in her hand when she died was a note that cried
'Fare Thee Well, Tecumseh Valley'

Well, the name she gave was Caroline
The daughter of a miner
An' her ways were free, an' it seemed to me
That sunshine walked beside her
