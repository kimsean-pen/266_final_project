I wanna do great things
I don't wanna compromise
I wanna know what life is
I wanna know everything

I wanna do great things
I don't wanna compromise
I wanna know what love is
Is it something I do to myself?

All is fair in love and war
Or so they say and so the saying goes
But I've seen more broken hearts
Than you can count the bullets in a war

Oh, what do I know?
There's gotta be so much I don't know

I wanna do great things
I don't wanna compromise
I wanna know what life is
I wanna try everything

I wanna do great things
I don't wanna compromise
I wanna know what love is
Is it something I do to myself?
Something I do to myself?

What is life apart from memories or
Dreams and friendships we have known?
And it smells childhood tales
Contemplating clothes that you have worn

Oh, what do I know?
There's gotta be so much I don't know

I wanna do great things
I don't wanna compromise
I wanna know what life is
Is it something I do to myself?
Something I do to myself?

Never wanted many things
Except the chance to learn from my mistakes
Funny how you never learn
But know them when they come around again

Oh, what do I know?
There's gotta be so much I don't know

I wanna do great things
I don't wanna compromise
I wanna know what life is
I wanna try everything

I wanna do great things
I don't wanna compromise
I wanna know what love is
Is it something I do to myself?
Something I do to myself?
Something you do to yourself?
