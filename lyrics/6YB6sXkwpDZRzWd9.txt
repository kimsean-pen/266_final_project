What did you think I'd find?
I'll keep on trying to change your mind.

Hug, hug, hug me and kiss, kiss, kiss me.
Tell me, tell me, tell me you'll miss, miss, miss me.

What did you think I'd do?
The ch-ch-changes you put me through.

The sun shines brightly every day I'm without you but I love, love, love you like the way that I used to do.
