I won't say it for
Any reason at all
Just know
I can't explain the words
I fail to say

I can't drive another road
That doesn't guide me back home
Alone, someday I would say
I am all I am
I am all the same

Driving home to darkened streets
Please show yourself to me
And I fall down
To the rhythm of loosing you
And I still choose
The comfort in finding you

But you can't fail to see
Anything but me
And the world that we make
When it falls into place
I think it's fair to say
That we have both seen better days
And I can't seem to be
Anything but me
And a fool to myself
I got no one else
I think it's fair to say
That we have both seen better days

Well I hope
That you know
That I can't
Feel a thing
From this high
That I've got
But everything is burning up
Inside my heart

I swear that I'm finally taking
My words that are bruised and broken
To places I've never spoken
Way down, way down

(Well I hope)
I swear that I'm shifting forward
(That you know)
And I'll try to provide it all for you
(That I can't)
For reasons I've never spoken
(Feel a thing)
Way down
Way down
