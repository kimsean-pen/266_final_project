Did you wonder why
You tossed and turned all night trembling (to this world)
Why the earth stood still
And the birds don't cry

You're not holding on to this world
You're not holding on to this world (did you wonder why?)

Did you hear the shriek that was
Moving in the wind (to this world)
Did you feel it then you had no place to go (to this world)
Did you need some peace that night
In the ground below (to this world)
Is it good enough now that
There's nothing to hold

You're not holding on to this world
You're not holding on to this world

You're not what you were
You're not what you were, you're not
You're not holding on
You've hurt everyone

Did you hear the saints
When you killed your man
Did you hold on tight to sin
Burning in your hand
Cause you're not holding on to this
You're not holding on
You're not holding on to this
You're not holding on
To this world
