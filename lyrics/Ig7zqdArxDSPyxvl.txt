It's been in the past for a while
I get a flash and I smile
Am I crazy?

Still miss you baby
It was real, it was right
But it burned too hot to survive
All that's left is, all these ashes

Where does the love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever?
After all the time we spent together
I have to know why I had to lose you
Now you've just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean
Doo doo do

Doo doo do do
Do do do do do do dooo
Do do do do do do do

In a dream you appeared for a while you were here
So I keep sleeping just to keep you with me
I'll draw a map, connect the dots
All the memories that I got

What I'm missing I'll keep reliving
Where does the love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done

How could I be losing you forever?
After all the time we spent together
I have to know why I had to lose you
Now you've just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean
This is it, let go, breathe
You don't have to love me for me to, baby, ever understand
Just love all of the time that we both had
And I don't ever want to see you sad, be happy

And I don't want to hold you if you don't want to tell me you love me, babe
Just know I'm gonna have to walk away
I'll be big enough for both of us to say, be happy
Doo doo do
Doo doo do do
Be happy, be happy
Do do do do do do dooo
Do do do do do do do
Be happy
