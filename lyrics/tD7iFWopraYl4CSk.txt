Your songs remind me of swimming
Which I forgot when I started to sink
Dragged further away from the shore
And deeper into the drink.
Sat on the bottom of the ocean
A stern and stubborn rock
'Cause your songs remind me of swimming
But somehow I forgot.
I was sinking and now I'm sunk
I was drinking and now I'm drunk
Your songs remind me of swimming
But somehow I forgot.
I tried to remember the chorus
I can't remember the verse
'Cause that song that sent me swimming
Is now the life jacket that burst.
Rotting like a wreck on the ocean floor
Sinking like a siren that can't swim anymore
'Cause your songs remind me of swimming
But I can't swim anymore.
Pull me out the water, cold and blue
I open my eyes and see that it's you
So I dive straight back in the ocean
So I dive straight back in the ocean.
Take a deep breath, suck the water in my chest
Take a deep breath, suck the water in my chest
Cross my fingers and hope for the best
Then all of a sudden, I heard a note
It started in my chest and ended in my throat
Then I realized, then I realized
Then I realized I was swimming
Yes I was swimming
And now I'm swimming
Yes I am swimming
Your songs remind me of swimming
Which I forgot when I started to sink
Your songs remind me of swimming
Which I forgot when I started to sink
Oh, your songs remind me of swimming
Which I forgot when I started
Your songs remind me of swimming
Which I forgot when I started
To sink
