Silhouette of a violet view
Felt it fade
Was it too soon?

Hollow, you can't hold it in

Poison in your mood
Chlorine eyes from you

Found your place in a model face
Fell into the violent daze

Hollow, you can't hold it in
Pour out all your emptiness

Poison in your mood
Chlorine eyes from you
Decorated blue
Opening a wound

Wound
Wound
