These days I can not find
A way back of the dark
I lost my senses

In my reflection a shadow of the man
I'm just a stranger to myself

No, the silence, keeps coming!

Please don't cry again
Please don't shed the tear
Cuz I can't bear to face what I did
Let me take your hand
Please let me back to your side
In your eyes I see what I've become!

This room without you
Becomes way too small
I feel its crushing my brain
My broken mirrors, glass on the floor
Scattered pieces of my soul!

No, the silence, keeps coming!

Please don't cry again
Please don't shed the tear
Cuz I can't bear to face what I did
Let me take your hand
Please let me back to your side
In your eyes I see the man I am!

Don't hide your face, don't hide away
Oh don't you hide from me!
I look to you for my relief
Please take me out of here!
I came to my wrong turn
I failed bid you to give me fate
So hear me!
Please don't cry again
Please don't shed the tear
Cuz I can't bear to face what I did
Let me take your hand
Please let me back to your side
In your eyes I seal the man I am
