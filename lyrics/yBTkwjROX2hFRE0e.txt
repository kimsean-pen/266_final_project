Close to the citadel, she raises her latern
Close to the citadel, she raise her laquered hooves
The long road division, for lack of another route

And these then were all too good advantage lost
And I grow suspect as soon as your friendliness rises
Cause one man alone stands a chance
But not a second chance

Close to the citadel will hasten to affirm
For this congress we have ridden doubly against
And we'll grow suspect as soon as their friendliness rises
And I alone stand a chance
But not a second chance
