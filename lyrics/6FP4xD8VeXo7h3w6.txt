I've been walking
Talking to myself
Following words
In my garden?
And turn back to the sun
It begins, I run

I should have loved you the first time
You were so bright, I was so blind
I could have said that you were all mine
Why did I leave you on the fault line?

Is it a thing to die for
Heavy heart of gold
A thing to lie for
Something that I sold
I've been walking
Walking through myself
Following you
To my only?

I should have loved you the first time
You were so bright, I was so blind
I could have said that you were all mine
Why did I leave you on the fault line?

Running around this greasy town
Hit the cold night on the main street
Falling out, falling in
And all I can hear is your names
Standing here, waiting there
Hit the white light,?
I'm a fire, I can fight
I'm a twisted fucked up fool I know

I should have loved you the first time
You were so bright, I was so blind
I could have said that you were all mine
Why did I leave you on the fault line?

I should have loved you the first time
You were so bright, I was so blind
I could have said that you were all mine
Why did I leave you on the fault line?

End
