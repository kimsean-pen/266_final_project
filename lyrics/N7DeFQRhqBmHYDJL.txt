I know I'll never forget
That day, the first time we met
We've come a long way since then
And I would do it all again

From your very first smile
I knew that I'd walk a mile
See, it's for real when you know
You never wanna let go

These are the reasons
I want you to know
You make this place feel like home

These are the reasons
I can't let you go, oh oh
Let's sing a song that we wrote
When we're old, ah ah

When we're old, ah ah

No matter what comes our way
I feel like I'm here to stay
You were the right from the start
And let me inside your heart

After all this time
I hate the sound of goodbye
And if you leave I would...

These are the reasons
I want you to know
You make this place feel like home

These are the reasons
I can't let you go, oh oh
Let's sing a song that we wrote
When we're old, ah ah

When we're old, ah ah

Right from our very first kiss
I knew it'll end up like this
I'm not afraid to grow old
If I have your hand to hold
