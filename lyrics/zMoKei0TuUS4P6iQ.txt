Imagine if you can, what it is like
To have no possessions at all, nothing
Very few people are able to imagine
Such a thing to have nothing at all

Well let us, you and I, try to imagine
Something a hundred times harder
Not just to have nothing at all
But when there was nothing at all

The very beginning of time
The dawn of history
Page one
Nothing at all

The earth itself
Without form and void
Only an emptiness, formless
A dark endless waste of water

No living thing, no plant or tree
No bird or animal, nothing
This is before people
Before anything at all
A void, sitting silent
Still and then nothing

Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
