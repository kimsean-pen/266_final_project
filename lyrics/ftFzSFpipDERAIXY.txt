Sweetheart
listen
I know the last few pages
Haven't been good for the both of us

And I've caused you a lot of grief

but put those bags down
okay?
Before you make a decision like that

please just listen to me

'Cos I don't want to leave

I definitely don't want you to leave

Just hear me out:

Honey
don't leave me now
with my head on my shoulders wrong

Have I done something wrong for you to leave?
I know I've been careless
girl
and I must apologize

I'll try better next time
baby
if you let me stay.

If you let me stay - I'll say what I should have said

If you let me stay - I should have said that I love you
If you let me stay - And I should have said it from my heart -
If you let me stay.

How can I compensate for my indiscretions

Dear
tell me it's not too late
that I'd love to hear

'Cause if you walk out on me
you will see a grown man cry

I didn't miss my water
'til my well ran dry.
But if you let me stay - I'll say what I should have said - . . .
Your pretentions aim for gullible fools
And now
who needs you
anyway?
I'll get mine where I taught the school
You will regret it some day!
If you let me stay - I'll say what I should have said - . . .
'Cause I need you
I'm not a man without you
baby.
If you let me stay - I'll say what I should have said - . . .
If you Let me stay - I'll say what I should have said - . . .
