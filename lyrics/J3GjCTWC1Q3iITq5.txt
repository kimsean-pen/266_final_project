Eternal happiness, clapped in irons.
Eternal happiness, mighty strikes.
Break their bands asunder.
Cast away their cords from us.
Cadence of horror.
Pull the hammer fast, pull the scalp back.
Atop the ashes, of one thousand ghosts!!!!!!!
Tall and gleaming Judas millennia.
Perhaps tomorrow, your trumpet will sound.
Perhaps tomorrow...
Perhaps never.
