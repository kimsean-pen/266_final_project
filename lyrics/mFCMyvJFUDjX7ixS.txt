I'll see you at the gates when it gets dark
You jump the wall, I'll find a place to park
Kill the angels if they're keeping guard
How do I start when you don't know what to say?
No, I don't know what to say

You said: "The world's already full enough
Of defeated people, and you would not be one"
Always a choice to move yourself along
And find better, and I hope that's where you are
Yeah, I know that's where you are

A doppelg√§nger with a telling scar
I saw the universe hidden in your heart
Wish I told you this before it got too dark
Where do you start when you know it has to end?

How a flower in the rain
Only grows more when it's grey
You just shined on brighter
Making gold out of the pain
"I can die, but I can't break," you said
"You can rule, I won't obey"
As long as I'm still smiling
Well, I don't know what to say
