Every time that you're walking by
I feel the vibe inside
There's something about the way you are

That's giving me butterflies
Maybe the planets have aligned
Maybe it's all in my mind

So let me just introduce myself
Before I get too shy
I've seen you in my dreams at night
To you I fantasize

You caught my eye
You're just so fine
You caught my eye
You're just so fine

I'm burning up for you
I'm burning up for you

I see diamonds in the sky
Touch my hand and I can fly
All this is a mystery
So come on, come on
And dance with me

I can't believe it's 4 am
Where did the time go?
I could sit here for days and days
Just hanging with you alone

We got an instant history
Some supernatural chemistry
Can't you feel it, can you feel it, oh?

But I'm giving you my number now
Before this goes too far
It's getting really hot in here

And soon it will be hard to say goodnight
The time's not right
So say goodnight before I die

I'm burning up for you
I'm burning up for you

I see diamonds in the sky
Touch my hand and I can fly
All this is a mystery
So come on, come on
And dance with me

You make me feel like fire
Is this love or just desire?
You make me feel like fire
Is this love or just desire?

I'm burning up for you
I'm burning up for you
I'm burning up for you
I'm burning up for you

I see diamonds in the sky
Touch my hand and I can fly
All this is a mystery
So come on come on
And dance with me

I see diamonds in the sky
Touch my hands and I can fly
All this is a mystery
So come on come on
And dance with me
