You're injuring my feelings
With your undisputed icons
And your illusions of happiness
Will not let you down

My vision of living
Impeach everything I find and
Hide and conspirating something
What will crush you down

I remember cuz this really are
So unpredictable
This air is so weight
Your eyes are so blind now

I'm breaking your heavy
Impenetrable, bristling armor
My unsuccessful attempts
Cannot crush you down

You're injuring my feelings
With your undisputed icons
And your illusions of happiness
Will not let you down

My vision of living
Impeach everything I find and
Hide and conspirating something
What will crush you down

I remember cuz this really are
So unpredictable
This air is so weight
This air is so weight

I refuse to believe
I refuse to undestand your thoughts
He gave me nothing

I only sought to myself
I don't care what you are trying
To impose on me

I'm breaking heavy
Your bristling armor
My unsuccessful attempts
Cannot crush you
Cannot crush you down
Cannot crush you down, down

I remember cuz this really are
So unpredictable
This air is so weight
My feelings empty now

So much is wasted living in fear
Let religions, religions die here
