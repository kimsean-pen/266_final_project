Whoa, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

How to choose?
Who to be?
Well, let's see
There are so many choices now
Play guitar
Be a movie star
In my head are voices

Why not try everything?
Why stop?
Reach for any dream
I can rock, 'cause, it's my life
And now's the time

Who will I be?
It's up to me
All the never ending possibilities that I can see
There's nothing that I can't do

Who will I be?
Yes, I believe
I get to make the future what I want to
If I could become anyone and know the choice is up to me
Who will I be?
Yeah, yeah

If I decide
I'm the girl to change the world
I can do it anytime
Opportunity right in front of me
And the choice is all mine

Why not try everything?
Why stop? Reach for any dream
I can rock, 'cause, it's my life
And now's the time

Who will I be?
It's up to me
All the never ending possibilities that I can see
There's nothing that I can't do

Who will I be?
Yes, I believe
I get to make the future what I want to
If I could become anyone and know the choice is up to me
Who will I be?

I wanna find out
Who I am inside
Who will I be?
I wanna show the
The way that I can shine

(Who will I be?)
Oh, yeah, yeah

Who will I be?
It's up to me
All the never ending possibilities that I can see
There's nothing that I can't do

Who will I be?
Yes, I believe
I get to make the future what I want to
If I could become anyone and know the choice is up to me (yeah)
Who will I be? (who will I be?)
Whoa, who will I be? (who will I be?)
Who will I be?
