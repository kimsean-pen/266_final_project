Yes!
We don't stop!
So, nothing stopping me!
We have dreams!
We have a lot of friends!

We don't stop!
So, nothing stopping me!
We have dreams!
We have a lot of friends!

音を鳴らして つまみぐいして
泣いた過去には すこしのウインクを
夢を数えて 占いもちょっと
There is nothing stopping me！
Yes！ The FUTURE！

鼻歌にのせて
Are you ready? Are you ready?
迷いはない Follow me!
Are you ready? Are you ready?

どんな夢をこの先で
歌いながら叶えよう?
思ってるよりもずっと
わたしの世界は広い

Yes!
We don't stop!
So, nothing stopping me!
We have dreams!
We have a lot of friends!

We don't stop!
So, nothing stopping me!
We have dreams!
We have a lot of friends!

声を鳴らして つまみぐいして
恥じた過去には おやすみのキスを
夢を数えて 占いもちょっと
There is nothing stopping me!
Yes! Come on my FUTURE!

鼻歌にのせて
Are you ready? Are you ready?
迷いはない Follow me!
Are you ready? Are you ready?

どんな夢をこの先で
歌いながら叶えよう？
思ってるよりもずっと
わたしの世界は広い

This is just my FUTURE!
This song about us forever!
Are you ready?
Never seen before!
It's just what I imagined!

This is just my FUTURE!
This song about us forever!
Are you ready?
Never seen before!
It's just what I imagined!

Come on!
