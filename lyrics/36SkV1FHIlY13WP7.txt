I never called you to help me out 'cause I knew that
you would stay and take what you wanted until you were full
Take what you wanted 'til I was empty

'Cause I can feel your breath on my neck,
your hand in my pocket, but I don't dare stop it
I know you'll take what you want
I'd rather my money than more of my
family so slow as you make your advance
You smile and approach
I know that you're hungry, so take my arms and my legs
My mind and my body
Just leave those who love me

And into the water I went before I knew exactly what I did
Control was forfeited when I let
someone else that I trust decide for me
I'm still just as broken as when I was fourteen
Upset my heart and feel it twisting in my chest before I
wretch out onto the floor to attempt to finally remove it
Pull it apart to feel like myself again

And I know that I'm just like you because I hate you
And I've grown to pretend you were here so that I'm not alone
And I know that I'm just like you because I hate you
And I've grown to pretend you were here so that I'm not alone

I never called you to help me out 'cause I knew that
you would stay and take what you wanted until you were full
Take what you wanted 'til I was empty
Called you to help me out 'cause I knew that you
would stay and take what you wanted until you were full
Take what you wanted
