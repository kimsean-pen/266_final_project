Small town once you get around
Everybodys safe and sound 'cause
The actions happening somewhere else

There are a few shop one that sells
Lots of special shipping market deals
Can be quite fun if there's nothing else to do

And I would like to fly away
Around here everybody knows my name
And they all think I am so strange
Because I don't look quite the same
