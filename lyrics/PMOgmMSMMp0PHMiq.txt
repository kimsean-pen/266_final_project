Hey girl, Imma eat your soul
I got this sword
Dashing, young and bold
Let's collect hearts on the way
Plus two, to you, in the evil bay
So hey girl, what should we do?
Get clues, drink some potions that are blue
Well, you know, there just isn't time
I don't got the time
I don't got the time

Oh, look up girl, show me what you have to use
(Right now I'd...) Oh, look up girl, show me what you have to use
(Right now I'd... I'd be the bitch, but I left you, I left you in the ditch)
(Right now I'd...) Oh, look up girl, show me what you have to use
(Right now I'd be the...) Oh, look up, girl...

Bite the line, remove the words that follow (This battle's narrowing)
Turn the key or in the mud you wallow (Hold off, I surrender)
Stay for me (Burning bushes may be cold as shoulder)
One door...
Flip the latch
Go on and catch the boulder
(Can't fake now)
Let go!

Step back, let go
Step back, let go
Step back, let go
Step back, let go

"All of those who took the road before you
They were possessed by the dark power
But you... you shall do this alone
As you walk through the valley of the Gorgonian Tempest
The tri-elemental black darkness was engulfing the sovereign lands
Use the plus nine staff of the bobcat, a voice said from above
Defeat the demon of Rathcorf and you shall restore peace to the land
And the lineage of your blood"

Step back, let go
Step back, let go
Step back, let go
Step back

(Step back, let go, step back, let go)
One night, I woke (Say one more line)
With all these hopes (Stay for me)
(Step back, let go, step back, let go)
Say one more line
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
Stay for me...

(Step back, let go, step back, let go)
One night, I woke (Say one more line)
With all these hopes (Stay for me)
(Step back, let go, step back, let go)
Say one more line
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing

(Step back, let go, step back, let go)
One night, I woke (Say one more line)
With all these hopes (Stay for me)
(Step back, let go, step back, let go)
Say one more line
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
Stay for me...
