Staying up driving
How we almost lost ourselves
As morning was breaking
And the parkway took us

Underneath the mountain's shadow
Holding on to love that we've known
Waiting for the sun to show again

And down in the valley
How we almost lost our way
But behind those hilltops
There is light obstructed

Underneath the mountain's shadow
Holding on to love that we've known
Waiting for the sun to show again

Underneath the mountain's shadow
Holding on to love that we've known
Waiting for the sun to show again
