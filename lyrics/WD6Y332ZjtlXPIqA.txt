Lookin' at you with a little love in my eyes
Don't know if you feel it, but I'm pushin' the vibe oh oh
Yea but I'm pushin' the vibe
It's only been a week, but I'm catchin' the feels
In the fast lane, but we're burnin' the wheels oh oh
Is it too late for me to say-ay it? Ohhh let me say
You ain't gotta pretend that there's nobody else
If there's any nonsense, then maybe I can help
Gotta couple of reasons why you should forget
Gotta couple of reasons why you will regret
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do
Nothin' nothin' only me and you
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do
Nothin' nothin' only me and you
8 a.m. wake up with your hands in my hair
Pick up where we left off
Got me feelin' some way oh
Oh you got me feelin' some type of way owoh
T-t-took me out for breakfast, and I'm feelin' the spin
I don't know your flavor, but I'm letting it in
And damn you look good in a blue t-shirt
Oh I don't know what it is, but somethin' 'bout this works
You don't gotta pretend to play it cool
Comin' on top strong, that's what we do-oo-ooh
Gotta couple of reasons why you should forget
Gotta couple of reasons why you will regret
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do
Nothin' nothin' only me and you
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do
Nothin' nothin' only me and you
I can pu-ull my heart out, show you how it's beatin' for you
B-but that would be a little bit crazy, little bit crude
But all my thoughts are OT for you
I should chi-ill the fuck out, but that would be lyin' to you
It's not even that D that got me, I like fuckin'
But there's so much more that I wanna do, oo-ooh, oo-ooooh
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do (nothin' we do)
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do (nothin' we do-ooh)
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do (nothin' we do)
Nothin' nothin' only me and youuu (oo, oowoo-oo-oo, oowoh oh oh)
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do (nothin' we do, nothin' we do)
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do (oo, oowoo-oo, oowoh oh oh)
Nothin' nothin' nothin' nothin' we do (nothin' we doooh)
Nothin' nothin' only me and you
Oh-wooh
Oo-oo-oo-oo-uh
For s'oohoo
Uh, eh-uh, eh-uh-eh-ee-uhn
