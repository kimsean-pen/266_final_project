I know a crossroads where I see him, see them
I want it to be over, I want it to be over
So I swim to you while I'm sleeping
Through sage green rivers of England

I see the scenery changes, changes
I want it to be over, I want it to be over
When I don't think of you, the willpower
What I didn't see was
I was talking to so many people at once
I had no idea I was
I had no idea of the difference between

The way I saw your face and the way it was

Because of a few songs
Because of a few songs
Because of a few songs
Because of a few songs
Because of a few songs
Because of a few songs

Because of a few songs
Because of a few songs

I remember laughing
to take that away from you
To take that away from you
I remember laughing
I remember laughing
to take that away from you
To take that away from you
I remember laughing
The smaller the waves
you let me down
No longer I will defend you
The smaller the waves

you let me down
No longer I will defend you
(because of a few songs)

I want it to be over, I want it to be over
I want it to be over, I want it to be over
I want it to be over, I want it to be over
I know a crossroads where I see him, see him
I want it to be over, I want it to be over
I want it to be over, I want it to be over
I want it to be over, I want it to be over
