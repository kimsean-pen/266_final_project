Oh, if you could see me now

Oh, if you could see me now
It was February fourteen, Valentine's Day
The roses came, but they took you away
Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone
And I'll never get to show you these songs
Dad, you should see the tours that I'm on
I see you standing there next to Mom
Both singing along, yeah arm in arm
And there are days when I'm losing my faith
Because the man wasn't good he was great
He'd say music was the home for your pain
And explain, I was young, he would say
Take that rage, put it on a page
Take the page to the stage
Blow the roof off the place

I'm tryna make you proud

Do everything you did

I hope you're up there with God
Saying that's my kid

I still look for your face in the crowd

Oh if you could see me now
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now
(Oh if you could see me now)

If you could see me now would you recognize me

Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me
Would you follow every line on my tear stained face
Put your hand on a heart that's was

cold as the day you were taken away
I know its been awhile but I could you see clear as day

Right now, I wish I could hear you say
I drink too much and I smoke too much dutch
But if you can't see me now that shit's a must

You used to say I won't know a win until it cost me
Like I wont' know real love till I've loved then I've lost it
And if you've lost a sister, someone's lost a mom
And if you've lost a dad, then someone's lost a son
And they're all missing now, and they're all missing now
So if you get a second to look down at me now
Mom, Dad, I just missing you now

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now
Oh, Oh...
Would you call me a saint or a sinner?
Would you love me a loser or winner?
Oh, Oh...
When I see my face in the mirror
We look so alike that it makes me shiver

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now
I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now
Oh.
You could see, you could see me now
(You could see, you could see me now)
