I know you're there
Cause I saw you there
Where'd you go?
Cause now you're gone

And there was a picture of you
And there was a picture of me too
And I don't know how I went wrong
Or how to move on?

So don't worry now
Don't worry now

I know you're there
And I wanted you there
Where'd you go?
Cause somehow you're gone

And there was a picture of you
And there was a picture of me too
And I don't know how I went wrong
Or how to move on?

But don't worry now
Don't worry now

And I said and I said
And I said and I said

Don't worry now
Don't worry now
Don't worry now
Don't worry now
