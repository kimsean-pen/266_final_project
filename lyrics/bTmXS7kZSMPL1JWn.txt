I've spent a lifetime crossing this culture
Your sea of hate
Others who found God, gray existing cold
Let's all rejoice in the end times
Of sorrow and grief and an ocean of love

I can stare into a soul
I can stare into the sun
Yeah, I want my life to begin
All I have to do is let the right one in

I'm only human sometimes
I am the king of disorder
I'm only human sometimes
The sins of the father, the sins of the flesh tonight

I'm only human sometimes
I am the king of disorder
I'm only human sometimes
The sins of the father, the sins of the flesh tonight

I'm not as ugly as I once was
I'm not as shameful as I used to be
Open your eyes, boy, open up the dream
Yeah, I want my life to begin
All I have to do is let the right one in

I'm only human sometimes
I am the king of disorder
I'm only human sometimes
The sins of the father, the sins of the flesh tonight

I'm only human sometimes
I am the king of disorder
I'm only human sometimes
The sins of the father, the sins of the flesh tonight

I am usually distracted by the noise within my head
I have tried for so long to remove the pieces of clutter
But have found no solution, but to merely exist with these strangers
The mountains I move with one stroke of a pen are heavy

Soon I won't have the strength in my bones to kill a fly
I need to leave this place, I need to leave this place
Surrounded by fear, engulfed by flames
Endorsed by the most putrid, disgusting
Despicable hatred that does exist, we can find our way

I'm only human, I'm just a lie
I'm only human sometimes
I'm only human, I'm just a lie
I'm only human sometimes
