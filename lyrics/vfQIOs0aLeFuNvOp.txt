I pulled up to a drive
I tightened up my tie
And I need to make her wait
No sleep from the night before
Her dad answers the front door
And already knows my name

I stand in fear
As she gets near
That everything's okay
I hope this feeling never goes away

I never thought I'd find a love like this
There's no need to hide that feeling we get
Whenever we touch we can't resist
We go back to our first day
Our first kiss

Her face lit by a movie screen
She's leaning into me
And time seems to slip away
Later on we take a walk and
Good thing she likes to talk
'Cause I can't think of what to say

She looks at me
And she can see
The chance I wanna take
She moves in close
And take my breath away

I never thought I'd find a love like this
There's no need to hide that feeling we get
Whenever we touch we can't resist
We go back to our first day
Our first kiss

Every time feels like a first time

Looking back on what we had it never went away
She still makes me feel it every day

I never thought I'd find a love like this
There's no need to hide that feeling we get
Whenever we touch we can't resist
We go back to our first day
I never thought I'd find a love like this
There's no need to hide that feeling we get
Whenever we touch we can't resist
We go back to our first day
Our first kiss
