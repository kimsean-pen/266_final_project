No way No way... I can't stand this affection
The greatest fear is crossing time with no weight
Now there's no way to understand the actions
These words are for what will never gonna be

She said " I do not miss that life"
She said "Please, dry your eyes"

No way No way.I can't stand this direction
We keep our hands deeply in the dirt
We are not the same, hold off your obsessions
You're nothing to real, nothing to me

She said " I do not miss that life"
She said "Please, dry your eyes"

She said " I do not miss that life"
She said "Please, dry your eyes"

She said " I do not miss that life"
She said "Please, dry your eyes"

She said " I do not miss that life"
She said "Please, dry your eyes"
