Verse 1
I see the tear stains on your eyes
I know your hiding away from life
You can't break away
It's holding you so tight
I see the pain you've held inside
And you're believing all the lies
It's destroying you inside

Chorus
Take back your life
Don't give it up
Take back your dreams
Don't waste them
Take back your faith
You'll find it there
Take back your right to live alive

Verse 2
I see you fade away from me
I know you're struggling just to breathe
You're so wounded turn around
It's time to come alive
Think of memories long ago
Think of the life we used to know
I'd give up everything to bring you back

Chorus
Take back your life
Don't give it up
Take back your dreams
Don't waste them
Take back your faith
You'll find it there
Take back your right to live alive
