Who's the boy you like the most
Is he teasing you with underage?
Could he be waving from a tropical sunset?
Static silhouette somehow
Single in his bed someday
Quiet till it falls falls falls
Rome Rome Rome Rome
Focus looking forward the Colosseum
Oh no! what did I say? what can I say?
Rome Rome many tears have fallen here
I'll be driving, you look the other way
It ain't easy to ignore
When your shutters are open all the way
When it's candlelight I see I go insane
Distant silhouette somehow
We shared a cigarette somewhere
Addict till it falls, falls, falls
Rome Rome Rome Rome
Focus looking forward the Colosseum
Oh no! what did I say? what can I say?
Rome Rome many tears have fallen here
I'll be driving, you look the other way
Always and forevermore
I call to say I'm on the way
2000 years remain in a trash can
Let burn the cigarette somewhere
Ashes till it falls, falls, falls
I stand outside under broken leaves
I know I can't do without
The future's trying to wait
I've never loved you
And if I loved you
I wouldn't say that I'm sorry oh no
I stand outside under broken leaves
Always and forevermore
We're together dead and lonely
I thought I couldn't do this without you
Single in his bed somewhere
Ashes till it falls, falls, falls
