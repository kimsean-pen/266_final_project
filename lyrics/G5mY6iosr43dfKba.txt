I got that valentine virus
You know i got it from yer
There's a valentine virus
And I got it from yer

I got that saccharine sickness
You know I got it from you
Only lovers can get dumb from it
Nothing the chemist can do

All of it bluster and pageantry
All of it spoken sanely
All of it moored up and steady
But not that it mattered to me

It's all just to be with you again
It's all just to be with you again
It's the strongest of the airborne pathogens
It's all just to be with you again.

I got that valentine virus yeah
I got it from yer
I got that valentine virus
And still i think i got it from ya.

All of it gumption and counterfeit
Fired like a hope at the moon
All of my projects are replicates
Aggregates, stitched up and glued

It's all just to be with you again
It's all just to be with you again
It's the strongest of the airborne pathogens
It's all just to be with you again.

It's all just to be with you again
It's all just to be with you again
And the mourning of a lowly estimate
It's all just to be with you again.
