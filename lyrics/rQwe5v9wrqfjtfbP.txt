Do you feel like a chain store
Pratically floored
One of many zeroes
Kicked around bored
Your ears are full but you're empty
Holding at your heart
To people who never really
Care how you are
So give me coffee and TV, easily
I've seen so much I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead virtually
Sociability is hard enough for me
Take me away from this big bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again
Do you go to the country?
It isn't very far
There's people there that'll hurt you
Because of who you are
Your ears are full with their language
There's wisdom there, you're sure
Till the words start slurring
And you can't find the door
So give me coffee and TV, easily
I've seen so much I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead virtually
Sociability is hard enough for me
Take me away from this big bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again
So give me coffee and TV, easily
I've seen so much I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead virtually
Sociability is hard enough for me
Take me away from this big bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again
Oh, we can start over again
Oh, we can start over again
