I will not be tamed by the dark,
Every little sin made a mark
I am what I believe or was it luck
Did Heaven ever make you wonder?!

Oh, baby I love you so
Baby I love you oh oh, oh oh
Oho, oho, oho, oh, oh

Everything we are is a myth
On the dotted line, I exist
Your sweetest sympathies are a trick
Just take me 25 miles under!

Oh, baby I love you so
You know that I love ya?!
Baby I love you so-ooooh, oh oh
Oho, oho, oho, oh, oh
You know that I love ya
Oho, oho, oho, oh, oh

I can make the gold turn to rust,
Fire burgundy burns the path
You know it was real, from the start
You know that I'll hurt you, don't ya?!

Oh, baby I love you so
You know that I love you
Baby I love you so-ooooh oh oh
Oho, oho, oho, oh, oh
You know that I love ya
Oho, oho, oho, oh, oh
