This could have been my destiny
I've hit the wall arrestlessly
Discovered though was part of me
I let you make a fool of me

Now in your life, you had my love
And in your life, you wasted time

Now I should leave without a noise

Or fall in love with other boys
I'll just make my sorry sound
Following myself around

Now in your life, you had my love
In my life, you wasted time

You love everybody else
Everybody else
Wish I was everybody else...
