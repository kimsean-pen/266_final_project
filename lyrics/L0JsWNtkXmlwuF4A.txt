Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

These are a few of the things I find joy
Bracelets of fingers since I was a boy

Fly to the moon and I'll get there quite soon
If I wait awhile
Cradled in branches that stretched out their arms
I must wait awhile
Bending my mind as I pick up the flowers in May
Hearing the laughter that turns into tears every day

Fly to the moon on the curve of a spoon
I turn upside down
Tumbling through leaves as I scatter the seeds
On an eiderdown

Love, love, love

Fly to the moon and I'll get there quite soon
If I wait awhile
Daylight arrives with a turn of the skies
I must wait awhile
Clouds building castles
The wind comes and blows them away
Tears in the water makes circles for me as I play

Fly to the moon on the curve of a spoon
I turn upside down
Tumbling through leaves as I scatter the seeds
On an eiderdown

Love, love, love

These are a few of the things l find joy
Bracelets of fingers since I was a boy
