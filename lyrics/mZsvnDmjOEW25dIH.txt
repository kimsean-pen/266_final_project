I'm drinking dust
With eyes of rust
Tonight my tears might stain your wings
So flutter home
'Cause you're better off alone than with me

So hide your face
And tie your lace
And butterflies across your cheek
Forget how soon
You'll become a fool for words when I speak

Flutter girl
You don't want to know what I've lived
You don't want to take what I give
'Cause I give nothing for free
You don't want to know what I've lived
You don't want to take what I give
'Cause I give nothing for free

My hands are rough
My fingers cold
And your heart's so young and so naive
To ever feel
For a moment that I might let you believe

Flutter girl
You don't want to know what I've lived
You don't want to take what I give
'Cause I give nothing for free
You don't want to know what I've lived
You don't want to take what I give
'Cause I give nothing for free

I'll tear your wings
As I've melted your smile
[Incomprehensible]

Flutter girl
You don't want to know what I've lived
You don't want to take what I give
'Cause I give nothing for free
You don't want to know what I've lived
Flutter girl
