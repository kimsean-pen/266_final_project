I like to watch her sway
she's luck before i'm going away
i wonder what she thinks about herself
she is mine and no one else's

She turns the knife around (she turns the knife around)
i watch her run it down her side (i watch her run it down her side)
kisses my fingers when i go by (kisses my fingers when i go by)
(see my mother in her eyes) see my mother in her eyes
