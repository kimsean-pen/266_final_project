If I leave
Would you wait for me?
If I fall
Would you pray for me?
When I'm gone
Will they remember me
Or fade away
Into eternity?

Nothing lasts forever
I can't forget the past
I'm searching for the answers
Through the bottom of a glass
Now this empty road
I'm too weak to ride alone
I've come this far
But I've so far to go

(Down) Down on me
When it rains it pours
'Till we all fall down

Do the pictures on the wall
Mean anything at all
Or just your selfish way
To cope with all the pain?

At night I hear the screams
Echo in my dreams
And when I've hit the ground
You kick me when I'm down

(Down) Down on me (Down on me)
Drowning me (Drowning me)
No use in pretending
Like we've done before
(Down) Down on me (Down on me)
My dark reverie
Nothing lasts forever
Just revolving doors

(Take) Take me away
Away from all the pain
Take me in his place
So far away
Away from empty streets
Streets I've only known
Only left to roam

Roam to the other side
So take, take me
Why don't you take me away?

We all fall
We all hurt
We all bleed

We all fall
We all hurt
We all bleed

(Down) Down on me (Down on me)
Drowning me (Drowning me)
No use in pretending
Like we've done before
(Down) Down on me (Down on me)
My dark reverie
Nothing lasts forever
Just revolving doors
