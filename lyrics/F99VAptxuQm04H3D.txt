LETRA 'ENEMY FIRE'

* Servicio no gratuito

Oh, Oh, Oh Enemy Fire!

Who's a friend, who's an enemy
Because sometimes it looks the same to me
But looks can be pleasing, yet so deceiving
Sweet words from a serpents tongue
Its like playing with a loaded gun
Who knows what truth is
How do you prove it
I swear I see you watching me, well

Oh, Oh, Oh
Come a little closer
Oh, Oh, Oh
You can be my solider
Oh, Oh, Oh
Keeping me save from all who conspire
Enemy Fire!
Oh, Oh, Oh
I'm looking for some shelter
Oh, Oh, Oh
From the helter skelter
Oh, Oh, Oh
Just keep me away from all who conspire
Enemy Fire!
Oh, Oh, Oh Enemy Fire! Burn a hole through the plastic crowd
Because I've been trying to find the way out
Its so confusing but never amusing
Sweet smiles in the aftermath
Turn and whispering behind my back
I need an ally to guard the nighttime
Someone to keep me from these crazies

Oh, Oh, Oh
Come a little closer
Oh, Oh, Oh
You can be my solider
Oh, Oh, Oh
Keeping me save from all who conspire
Enemy Fire!
Oh, Oh, Oh
I'm looking for some shelter
Oh, Oh, Oh
From the helter skelter
Oh, Oh, Oh
Just keep me away from all who conspire
Enemy Fire!
Oh, Oh, Oh Enemy Fire! All around me I here cries
And bones are falling from the skies
Can't you help me save that life

Oh, Oh, Oh
Come a little closer
Oh, Oh, Oh
You can be my solider
Oh, Oh, Oh
Keeping me save from all who conspire
Enemy Fire!
Oh, Oh, Oh
I'm looking for some shelter
Oh, Oh, Oh
From the helter skelter
Oh, Oh, Oh
Just keep me away from all who conspire
Enemy Fire!
Oh, Oh, Oh Enemy Fire!
