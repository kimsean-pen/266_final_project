Always wanna go
Always tell her "Yes", never tell her "No"
Know you think you know everything, but you don't
Wanna do the right thing, but you probably won't
So you chase the night life blinded by the lights
Bottom of a empty glass, where you find life
Always left behind, because she think she right
Thinking that she grown but always need your advice
And always in situation that she needs your help
But wouldn't help another, only care her about herself
In our VIP asking where the drink at
Calling her a groupie, you'd think she'd really think that?
She just wanna hear that that ass look right
What you doing after this? Fuck tomorrow night
Wanna snort some blow? Pop a lotta pills?
Fucking when the sun come up, she don't feel

She wanna party all the time
Party all the time, she wanna party all the time

She wanna party all the time
Party all the time, she wanna party all the time

Skip semester, class is a past
Say she going back but she ain't going back
Cause time ain't wating for a future on hold
At glass tables, on her knees, sniffing coke
Tell her get a hold, grip on life
Rather fill her cup up liquor with no ice
Twice had an abortion; young, dumb misfortune
Rate that she going, she might be whorin'
Signs she ignoring, but dosen't recognize
Blind to what's occuring, what's going in your mind?
Seven days a week same shit every morning
Calling her a cab from different niggas apartments
Wanting her to change but she won't, dog
Just another number in her fucking call log
Lost in the fog, head in the smoke
Laughing at the world 'cause her life is a joke
