Can't stay awake
I won't do all I can think of
Halter away I feel my body hesitating
Can't find a better long time
I swear he know how to tingle
Don't need to know that I need somebody else
To break us

Somebody who can stay awake
I need somebody who
Somebody who can stay awake
I need somebody who

You say one thing but I just can't seem to fish'em
Not seem right but the impression that you're giving
Sometimes I wish that night could show me what I'm missing
And tell me just not I want

Somebody who can stay awake
I need somebody who
Somebody who can stay awake
I need somebody who
Somebody who can stay awake
I need somebody who
Somebody who can stay awake
I need somebody who

Take me up and turn me on
I can't stop it's what I want
Take me up and turn me on
I can't stop it's what I want

Somebody who can stay awake
I need somebody who
Somebody who can stay awake
I need somebody who
Somebody who can stay awake
I need somebody who
Somebody who can stay awake
I need somebody who
