Into a different kind of view
Not meant for human eyes
Everything's dark and fades away
This moment just opened my eyes, now I say:
I never knew anything felt like this
It has just begun

Please be aware of the change in your mind
Everyone's telling lies
Somewhere between every now and then
Harmoniously facing the truth of your past
I know by now, every night has its dawn
Be aware and see
I know by now, every night has its dawn
Be aware and see

And as your last day draws to an end
Take my last good smile
All I can do now is watch as you fall,
Bid my last good bye

There's an exception to every rule
Don't trust the yellow light
Constantly searching to find your way home
The beauty's been lying right here all along
Only Man ends. But forever's the world
Just don't fall asleep
So here we sway at the edge of the world
Holding hands
Clutching at straws, keep each other awake
World will not end at this shift
I never knew anything felt like this
It has just begun...
