Got this endless itch to ride
Into the night
Fortune cookie says I'm right
Kung Foo like

Shake your body Mister Gonna make ya body blister, say hey, hey, hey
Don't wanna have ta make ya. I don't wanna have ta shake ya down,
hey, hey, hey
I'll take ya till ya all spun up
Pitter, patter doesn't matter what you got
I'll take ya till ya all spun up
And in love And into the night life
I'll take ya till ya all spun up
Turn ya over baby till it's never enough
I'll take ya till ya all spun up
And in love And into the night life
Love, and into the night life

Want to dress for you tonight
Under the light
Shot up like a satellite
Into the night
Shake ya money maker
I will never ba a faker now, hey hey hey
Leave 'em standing waiting' Till they're practically
faint in' now, hey hey hey

I'll take ya till ya all spun up
Pitter, patter doesn't matter what you got
I'll take ya till ya all spun up
And in love And into the night life
I'll take ya till ya all spun up
Turn ya over baby till it's never enough
I'll take ya till ya all spun up
And in love And into the night life
Love, and into the night life

Shirtless wonders wreck my sight Under the light

Love, And into the nightlifeShirtless wonders wreck my sight
Under the light.
