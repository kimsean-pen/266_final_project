Thought I truly lost my sight
No faith in me or anyone else
Lost in the customs of my soul
Perpetual gloom
Nowhere to go
And then you came
And showed me
A life I'd only dreamed of
Said, you came
And loved me
In my soul...
Thought I'd never write a song again
No Inspirations in my life
Melancholy moments playing my mind
Felt my sanity declined

And then you came
And showed me
A life I'd only dreamed of
Said, you came
And loved me
Uuuuuhh
Uhuhuhuh
Aaha la la la
Uuaaaauuuu
