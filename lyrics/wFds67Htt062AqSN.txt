Danceophobia - Duran Duran
Coming over you
Danceophobia
Coming over you
You are the floor what you gonna do
I'm on the system
I'm tryina get to you
We've both withered false alarm
Nothing can stop us
Come on this is our song
Look around look around
Forget the ground forget the ground
Take my hand take my hand
And sing it loud
I know what it is coming over you coming over you
You don't dance danceophobia danceophobia
I know what it is coming over you coming over you
You don't dance coming over
You don't dance
You're in the car we're going to
To lift the volume
Am I getting through to you
Open the window to see what you got
I'm in the speakers it's time to hit the
Look around look around
Forget the ground forget the ground
Take my hand take my hand
And sing it loud
I know what it is coming over you coming over you

You don't dance coming over

Can you hear me
If you can hear me let me know
I'm your doctor
You may be experience feelings of confusion
Don't be afraid I've seen these symptoms before
Ten twenty new cases each week
We call this causing danceophobia
I'm going to keep you in for observation
I may have to work on you throughout the night
We have to trust each other
And together together together
I think we can beat thing before the music ends
I know what it is coming over you coming over you
