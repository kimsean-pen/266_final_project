All our needs put together
Don't bleed on their own
You paid for an eyeful
So behold the bull
Why can't I look up, out in the clearing
Tell me what's there below, end over end
While he's safe for the moment, guess what I'm learning
He's never safe from the crowd

So hats off to the bull
No giving up
Either way, it makes ya mad
Well some of us
Hats off to the bull, keep giving all
What ya say we make amends

To be monumental
Could mean the beyond
The simpler the treasure
Means the higher the cost
Well as for the ending, damn right I'm learning
You might ask for the door, end over end
Well I hate how the clouds hide
The gasps from above

So hats off to the bull
No giving up
Either way, it makes ya mad
Well some of us
Hats off to the bull, keep giving all
What ya say we make amends

Find your challenge, suffer miles
Colors gray, he brings them out
Don't mind the challenge, suffer miles
A little shallow, if I don't say

Hats off to the bull
His time ain't up
Bitter hell in the lion's den
For some of us
Hats off to the bull
The sun won't set
Till the pain and the final breath

So hats off to the bull
No giving up
Either way, it makes ya mad
Well some of us
Hats off to the bull, keep giving all
What ya say we make amends
