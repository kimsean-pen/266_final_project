Don't Stop, don't stop, no
Just keep on goin'
Until I come, until I come in

Don't Stop, don't stop, no
Just keep on goin'
Until I come, until I come in

Playing hard to get when we're together
Hard to get there on your own
When will you ever come to conscience
I'll let you be alone

You never had it better
Than when I was with you, baby
Scum back to earth
Let's drink some tea and smoke some herb

Don't Stop, don't stop, no
Just keep on goin'
Until I come, until I come in

Don't Stop, don't stop, no
Just keep on goin'
Until I come, until I come in

Now I know it takes three balls to juggle
50 cents of humour's worth
When and how did I become my mother
Am I getting on your nerves?

Lets just not talk about it
And fill the blanks with space
Go to the park later
Get some ice cream

Don't Stop, don't stop, no
Just keep on goin'
Until I come, until I come in

Don't, don't
Just keep on goin'
Just keep on goin'

Don't Stop, don't stop
Just keep on goin'
Until I come, until I come in
Stop
