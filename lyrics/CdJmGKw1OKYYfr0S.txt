You can never see me shine like I always wanted you to
There's something in the way
Or you miss it again and again
Still shimmer holding out, always beaming over to you
So very far away
I hope it gets there still

Like the summer always fades and the wind gets cool on your skin
You know that something was, will never be again
We glimmer in the dark of a life we haven't known
Sometimes another one can let you know that you're there

Always keep your eyes on the pulsar
Guiding you home from wherever you are
We're on our way home from another star
It's been so long and we've come so far
We've come so far
