Man I got tens of dollars in my pocket right now
No flex

I don't mean to flex
But I've been having sex
Like once a week at least or two
If my girl ain't stressed

I don't mean to brag
But my bandwidth is flat
I got the Hulu plus bitch
Streaming with no ads

I don't pay the tab
I'm drinking whisky neat (hard)
Cause I know the owner Paul
He let me drink for free

I get my haircut twice a month that's my routine
Don't mean to stunt but its tough when my neck so clean

I'm speaking Spanish to the valet (no flex)
He peep my girl she got the v neck out here showing breast

Push an entry level Audi
My jeans distressed
My 9-5 keep me tied down like I'm possessed

I could buy out H&M (cash)
No interest on the lease I'm controlling what I spend (smart)
Give me 16 months Imma sign that shit again
Money looking nice got me keeping up with trends

Flex, not tryna flex
Man I'm holding half a stack not tryna flex
Flex, not tryna flex
Take your bitch to Nordstrom rack that's not a flex

Body count up in the double digits (11)
And when we hit the club we greasing palms and we get in it

Pull up in a foreign whip you hear my Honda civic
I pulled another foreign bitch I
think she might be British (I got a text!)

Pop the fucking champagne sipping cooks
And if I like her Imma poke her
Go insane on the book

I'm reckless on the gram
I can't be tamed, I'm a crook
I'm back 50 weeks
Liking pics you wish you could

You can call me two faced with the way I'm tossing coin
I don't do no chains, jeans too tight around my groin
Posting smoking on the pan bitch
I don't roll no joints
Got a couple open bottles rolling through these checkpoints

Man I always pay the rent
Ain't no holds up on my checks
If the waitress treat me right I'm tipping 21 percent

Pay for title should be canceled every month but I forget
It's whatever, Im too clever get refunded by the rep
Motherfucker it's not a-

Flex, not tryna flex
Man I'm holding half a stack not tryna flex
Flex, not tryna flex
Take your bitch to Nordstrom rack that's not a flex
