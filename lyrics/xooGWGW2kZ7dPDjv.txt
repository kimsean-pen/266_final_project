Keep your enemies closer they say
But I prefer mine dead and miles away
Wanna save the world now and right away?
Tomorrow would be better cos there wasn't one today

The absence of your mind
Preaching, judging
Is hard for you to fake
Reactions of your kind
Cringing, whingeing
Is too much for me to take

Ignorance is a bliss
That might be but not when you throw
Stones in a house made of glass
With your halo buried far up your ass

If a pen is mightier than a sword
I wish you luck sincerely in your world
What didn't kill you only makes you stronger
Is a crock of shit, I'm sick of it
Sick of you, fuck you too

Distress and nothing less you breed
Confess and you're blessed
Set free from your sin ain't that something
Absolution leaves me nothing

The absence of your mind
Preaching, judging
Is hard for you to fake
Reactions of your kind
Cringing, whingeing
Is too much for me to take

The absence of your mind
Preaching, judging
Is hard for you to fake
Reactions of your kind
Cringing, whingeing
Is too much for me to take
