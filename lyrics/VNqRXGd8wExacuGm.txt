I'm blue, blue like a Monday morning
Raised up in a way that I can value
All the material things that I could ever really need don't matter
So many ways that I can thank you
But you know that I am here and no-one else in this world will matter
I'm blue, blue like a Monday morning
It's true, it's you that's got me yearning
For a love that will last forever
Wishing that somebody somewhere
Would break through these wrought iron doors and just smile
Because I'm blue
I can't get emote to try and tell you
All the love that I have
Am I ever gonna make it happen?
So many ways that I can thank you
But you know that I'm here and no-one else in this
world will matter
I'm blue, blue like Monday morning
It's true, it's you that's got me yearning
Because I'm blue. Nobody knows that I'm blue
