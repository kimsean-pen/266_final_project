Stones in your eyes
Stones in your eyes
Stones in your eyes
Stones in your mouth
Stones in your ears
Stones in your mind
Stones in your eyes
Stones in your eyes

We live in a jar and think the lid's the sky
You're hoping for a savior on your cross outside
Stars are just a million little fireflies
The sun is just the hole, what is the light outside?

[backwards recording: The chariots shall rage in the streets. /Nahum 2: 4]

Chorus
No one saved me from my,
Ten years drowning from
darkness filling my life.
Where you going; let me stay tonight!

Holding out for rest but on the seventh day
I've created nothing and I'm wide awake
So can I tie my key to your electric kite
The rooster crowed twice and you kissed me good-bye

There's too many saviors on my cross again
I know I'm never gonna be a perfect man
Everyone's an oyster with their grain of sand
I love you most in summer now it has to end

Chorus
No one saved me from my,
Ten years drowning from
darkness filled my life.
Where you going; let me stay tonight x2

Stones in your eyes
Stones in your eyes

Stones in your eyes
Stones in your eyes

Stones in your eyes
Stones in your eyes

I'll run a million miles if you want first prize

Chorus
No one saved me from my,
Ten years drowning from
darkness fill my life.
Where you going; let me stay tonight x3
