Please disregard my naked faith
I just realized it takes two too late
Can we dish it out in daylight
Can we stare ourselves down
Can we manouver honesty when it comes swinging back around
Oh o-oh
Now we'll never know what legends we could be
Just me and you and you and me
Oh o-oh, now we'll never know what legends we were meant to be
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Please disregard my endless hope
It just paved the way for the end of our road
I sometimes called you, bluff in secret,
You sometimes wrestled with my nerves
Can you imagine anybody else so close to you it hurts
Oh oh-o-oh
Now we'll never know what legends we could be just me and you and you and me
Oh oh-o-oh
Now we'll never know what legends we were meant to be
Ooh oh oh
Please disregard
As I have done
Our civilized boats
Is not fooling them
Oh o-oh oh
Now we'll never know what legends we could be, just me and you and you and me
Oh o-oh oh
Now we'll never know what legends we could be, just dumb-ass you and dumb-ass me
Oh oh o-oh
Now we'll never know what legends we could be, oh oh-o oh oh
Oh oh o-oh
Now we'll never know what legends we were meant to be
Oh oh o-oh
The legends we set out to be
Oh oh oh oh o-oh
