I'm into deep your love
Baby, hold out then
날 꿈꾸게 해줘 매일 새롭게
점점 더 커져가는 fashion
감출 수 없이 아름다워

So tell you everything inside my head
Call me what you need, I'll be reachin' out
So tell you everything inside my head
Call me what you need, this is deeper than love
When I'm lookin' your eyes
Baby, holdin' it out you
Love me right be there
When I'm look in your eyes
Baby holdin' it out you
Love me right be there
Tell me let me be your love
Why won't you let me be your love
When I'm lookin' your eyes
Baby holdin' it out you
Love me right be there
When I'm look in your eyes
Baby holdin' it out you
Love me right be there
Tell me let me be your love

Why won't you let me be your love
Let me be your love
Why won't you let me be your love
Let me be your love
Why won't you let me be your love
I'm into deep your love

Baby hold out then
모두 잊게 해줘 내가 더 새롭게
조금씩 닮아가 between us
그 빛을 찾아가 난 계속

So tell you everything inside my head
Call me what you need, I'll be reachin' out
So tell you everything inside my head
Call me what you need, this is deeper than love
When I'm lookin' your eyes
Baby, holdin' it out you
Love me right be there
When I'm look in your eyes
Baby, holdin' it out you
Love me right be there
Tell me let me be your love
Why won't you let me be your love
Let me be your love
Why won't you let me be your love
Let me be your love
Why won't you let me be your love
Let me be your love
Why won't you let me be your love

This is deeper than love
