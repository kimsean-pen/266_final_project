Ive been searching for love
I'm sorry I escaped you
I wonder how I will end
For now, I'll will carry to push on through
And bite my jealous lip
And hope to turn it to a kiss

Take this night from me girl
You're stunningly divine
You're the love I've been searching for
Cos I will be true and be faithful
And that's not like me
So take the night from me

And now my worried concave of thoughts
Wont linger anymore
Because I've been trying my best
Yet still I've been skipping through my years
To cover my sacred tears,

Ready for the heartaches and fears

Take this night from me girl
You're stunningly divine
You're the love I've been searching for
Cos I will be true and be faithful
And that's not like me
So take the night from me
Take it from me

And then darling you will ask me where I've been
Take it from me
Take it from me
Take it from me
Take it from me
