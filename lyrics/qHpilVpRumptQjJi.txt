Were we just kids just acting out
Didn't we know then what love was about
Were we just fooling, playing around
Were we ever gonna get out of this town
Move to Seattle, stay up all night
That was when bedtime was our biggest fight
All in a moment, all in a sound
All in a day's work, we're tumbling down
Down by the old school trash in the street
Searching the eyes of the strangers we meet
Asking will it get better
Will we be alone turning the wheels
of our bicycles home
Over the rainbow, out in the snow
Learning to walk with the sand in our toes
Long to be tall, kissed when you fall
Hoping that someone will come when you cal
You call, you call, you call
You call, you call, you call
You call, you call, you call
You call, you call, you call
