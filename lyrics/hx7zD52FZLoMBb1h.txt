A note dropped through the door
Tells us to go
Oh but I know
That you will tell them to
Go somewhere else
Because you know that
I want to stay in this house forever
I don't want to ever leave
How could I ever live in another
This is where I want to be

You know that there won't be
A high wall I can climb
And find the things that I find
I'll have to leave them where they are
I don't want to go far

A tear-stained pillow
Doesn't seem to help me
I can't make you change your mind
I look through my window
And I see all I want to
How can I leave it all behind me now

I've done all I can do
I want to stay here
This could be my home forever
But you say I can't come back ever
You don't know just how much
I wish I could stay in this house forever
I don't want to ever leave
How could I ever live in another
This is where I want to be
You know that I don't want to go
