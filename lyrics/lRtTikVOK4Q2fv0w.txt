We're leaving all the windows open
We don't even mind the rain
Or where we let the floors get wet
So what if the hardwood stains?
'Cause we're collecting evidence
Of one remarkable storm
How wild it was to find it, finally feel the climate
Instead of only staying dry and warm

Rain on us, Saint Honesty
Salvation is coming in the morning, but now what we need
Is a little rain on our face from you, sweet Saint Honesty

So we won't sleep tonight
While we brace against the wind
Oh, these hearts, they're weather-makers
We'll go where they take us
Until we find ourselves shelter again
We won't settle for the silence
We won't drown in the tears
We'll say every single word even if we think they'll hurt
Let the rain wash away these tears

Rain on us, Saint Honesty
Salvation is coming in the morning, and now what we need
Is a little rain on our face from you, sweet Saint Honesty

Oh, we won't let go, we'll be soaked to the bone
Baptized by truth, we will reap what we sow
Build our own higher ground when the rain's coming down
This is worth it to me, Saint Honesty

Rain
Salvation is coming in the morning
We'll wait patiently, aiming straight for it
But now what we need
Is a little rain on our face from you, sweet Saint Honesty
