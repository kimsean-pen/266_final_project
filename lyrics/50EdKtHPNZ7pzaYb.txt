Pop another river, sip it up
Yeah it a sin to slip and rip it up
So let your hip swing lean and duck
'Til ya loose ya head an you join the ruck
Break a leg get it in, in, in
Got keys but no bim, bim, bim
Zim zimmer, no rim, rim, rim
Shim shimmer, dance floor driller
Oh yeah

Shim shimmy get the night shimmering
Issey Miya, you never seen me in
TT in the rave and its glimmerin'
Wet like a swimmer, drip, drip, drippin', oh yeah

All night 'til you see the sun rise giving them eyes like a killer
Dance floor driller, a demon them
Amorous statues we're hammering
Slap up your lovers batty, mhmm
Do the wine like its happy hour
You make me wanna die, die for you
Death so good, so don't cry for me, uhhh huh

Wet, wet like a swimmer and I'm shivering
