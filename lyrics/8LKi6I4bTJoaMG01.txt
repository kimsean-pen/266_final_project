I've had enough

Made a list of the things I hate
Includes fate, the way I can't relate
To your faith, or your crutch
Will you ever learn I've had enough?

Of all that contradicting speech
You cross lines with every word you speak
With no credit to your claims
Will you ever learn I've had enough?

Of the pressure
I can't measure
Intent
With a thought to resent, yeah

Give it up I'm seeing red
Stuck in hindsight wishing you were dead
The silence of tyrants
About time I stopped trying to hide it from you
And your false sense of rule (your rules)
Your faith, your crutch I've had enough

No value in spit that comes through those teeth
So stop wasting breath while you're pressing on me
To force lies, where they just don't fit
Don't want to hear it, no
No, no, no, no

You think I'll let your fate decide
What I do with my life?
Well, here's some news, I'd rather pick the noose
Than follow you to your demise
I've had enough
