And I feel invincible
without your wisdom
but i feel invisible
without your wit

and there's no easy way for me to make
this transmission
so i'll sit up high and wait for you to blink
I'm fond of you
but i don't believe you
and you'll lie to me
and i'll lie to you
and come caress me cause you'll be gone
and come undress me don't take to long
it's not your kindness that I want
so try and stop me from getting what i want
and it doesn't mean we gotta stop talking

now ill fall asleep
right here with you
And I feel invincible without your wisdom
but I feel invisible without your wit
and there's no easy way for me to make this transmission
so i'll sit up high and wait for you to blink
and blink once if you know me
and blink twice if you heard me
and blink again if you love me
and come caress me cause you'll be gone
and come undress me don't take to long
it's not your kindness that I want
so try and stop me from getting what i want
ill try to stop you from getting what you want
we'll be the only fools who last way to long
we'll be stuck here the very last ones
ooh oooh oooh oooh ooh
