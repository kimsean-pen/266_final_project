Going under slowly
It never seems too late
Going under so slow

Dressing up to kiss
Dressing up to touch all this

I'm dressing up to dance all week
I'm dressing up to sleep

Dressing up to kiss
Dressing up to be all this

I could eat your face
I could eat all of you
Oh this night will never let me go...

Going under slowly
Never seems too late
Going under slow
You'll pick me up again
