Speak to me, it all would be easier
Wanna talk to you, who is that?
Do I hear a whisper or do I hear a cry?
Across the brown land, the stumps of time

Oh, turn the wheel and heal me
Since moonlights fade I'm empty, heal me

I'm in search of the lionheart
(Drown Ulysses)
I am ashamed, I myself can't make it
Drowned here in the silence
(Drown Ulysses)
'Cause down to Hades, I've gone but I cannot get out

Down below I can't free my mind
(Soon I will fade away)
Down below I can't free my mind
(Soon I will fade)
Tic, tac is the message
And the lunatic fears, he's no more

Speak to me, it all would be easier
While I'm passing by, who's that?
Do I hear a whisper or do I hear a cry?
Across the brown land the ghost arrives

Pick up my bones and tell me
Is this the lake of fire? Hell, please

I'm in search of the lionheart
(Drown Ulysses)
Nobody else but the pure can save me
Drowned here in the silence
Drown Ulysses)
'Cause down to Hades I've gone but I cannot get out

Ruins rule my memories, can't recall the signs
Invite the dead then silence struck my mind
Silence is madness
Tic, tac, tic, tac, tic says the clock
(Silence is madness)

Speak to me, it all would be easier
Wanna talk to you, hear me
Welcome to the sad place and hand me what is mine
I'm the Theban prophet, the dead and blind

And from the sea you'll feel me
Then you'll breathe out gently, leave me

I'm in search of the lionheart
(Drown Ulysses)
I am ashamed, I myself can't make it
Drowned here in the silence
(Drown Ulysses)
'Cause down to Hades I've gone but I cannot get out
