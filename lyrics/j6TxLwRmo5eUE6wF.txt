"This night is cold," he said
As he turned from the dark and moved towards the amber light that glowed ahead
"I'll come along," she spoke
Her eyes remaining on the snow that collected softly in her palm

And with that, she watched her imprint grow
As seven bright stars lined up all in a row

See, they were once like you
They climbed the valley walls to hear the mountain's tales of unheard truths
But no one could have known
That they'd be taken one by one by force, the greatness overgrown

They're just a moment too soon
Or a second too late
They were nothing more than a moment too soon

"But what a fate," she cried
"Surely there is one who decides which way the wind turns in the morn"

"My darling girl," he said,
"There is no reason and no rhyme for those we love and those we bid goodbye"

There is no reason and no rhyme
There is no reason, no alibi
For those we love and those we must bid goodbye

There's just a moment too soon
Or a second too late
The phantom of warmth and outline of sorts
Those moments too soon
Or a second too late
Oh, sing to me of loss

There's just a moment too soon
Or a second too late
The phantom of warmth and outline of sorts
Those souls that I've lost
Those perfect ones
Oh, sing to me of loss

I wouldn't dare try
See, I know not of life and even less of loss
So I wouldn't dare try
