Can't forget
Waking up and you were there
Just a stranger in my bed
Lost what I already had
I was blinded for you

I turn away from the headlights
I turn away
Looking into my dead eyes
I turn away

You were right here but I was misled
Now there's a hole in my head
Thought I was heading somewhere
I was blinded for you

And I
I watch you fade, fade away
And I
I just can't stay, just can't stay

I turn away from the headlights
I turn away

Waking up and you were there
Just a stranger in my bed
Lost what I already had
I was blinded for you

I turn away from the headlights
I turn away
Looking into my dead eyes
I was lost in the real world

Thought I was heading somewhere
I was blinded for you
And I ...
I watch you fade, fade away
And I ...
I just can't stay, just can't stay
I turn away from the headlights
I turn away
