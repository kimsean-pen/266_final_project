They say that home is where the heart is
I guess i haven't found my home
and we keep driving round in circles
afraid to call this place our own

And are we there yet?

They say there's linings made of silver
folded inside each raining cloud
well we need someone to deliver
our silver lining now

And are we there yet?
and are we there yet?
and are we there yet?
home, home, home
home, home, home

They say you're really not somebody
until somebody else loves you
well i am waiting to make somebody somebody
soon

And are we there yet?
and are we there yet?
and are we there yet?
home, home, home.
home, home, home.

Where you will lie on the rug
while i play with the dog
and it won't be too much
cuz' this is too much
cuz' this is too much for me to hold
this is too much for me to hold

Home, home, home

And are we there yet?
and are we there yet?
and are we there yet?

Home, home, home
home, home, home
home

And are we there yet?
and are we there yet?
and are we there yet?
and are we there?
