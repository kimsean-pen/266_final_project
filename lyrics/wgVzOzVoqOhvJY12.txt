Straight signs
Crooked signals
Strike down
Last aerial

Heaven's bending
Below, the world begins to break
Life is ending
Time has come to escape
Down to the chambers

Drink this blood and we'll become immortal baby
This love, is breaking the one last bond

We choose the silence
Hatred, cruel violence
We should be ashamed
We had a chance but we ignored
Now it's too late the end is knocking on the door
Ready to drain us

Drink this blood and we'll become Immortal baby
This love, is breaking the one last bond

Surrender to my love
Sacrifice yourself
Your picture in the frame
is fading like a ghost
Never say goodbye
Never be alone
Never say goodnight
Never say did I
Drink this blood and we'll become Immortal baby
This love is breaking the one last
Drink this blood and we'll become Immortal baby
This love is breaking the one last
Immortal love is breaking the one last bond
