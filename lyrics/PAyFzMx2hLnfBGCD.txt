Good morning Miss, can I help you son?
Sixteen today and up for fun
I'm a big boy now or so they say
So if you'll serve I'll be on my way

Box of balloons with the feather-light touch
Pack of party-poppers that pop in the night
A toothbrush and hairspray, plastic grin
Miss Clay on all corners has just walked in

Welcome to the house of fun
Now I've come of age
Welcome to the house of fun
Welcome to the lion's den
Temptation's on his way
Welcome to the house of

No no no Miss, you misunderstood
Sixteen big boy, full pint in my manhood
I'm up to date and the date's today
So if you'll serve I'll be on my way

Welcome to the house of fun
Now I've come of age
Welcome to the lion's den
Temptation's on his way
Welcome to the house of fun

I'm sorry son but we don't stock
Party gimmicks in this shop
Try the house of fun, it's quicker if you run
This is a chemist's, not a joke shop

Party hats, simple enough clear
Comprehend savvy understand, do you hear?
A pack of party hats with the colored tips
Too late, gorgon heard gossip
Well, hello Joe, hello Miss Clay
Many happy returns from the day

Welcome to the house of fun
Now I've come of age
Welcome to the house of fun
Welcome to the lion's den
Temptation's on his way
Welcome to the house of fun

Welcome to the house of fun
Now I've come of age
Welcome to the house of fun
Welcome to the lion's den
Temptation's on his way
Welcome to the house of fun

Welcome to the house of fun
Now I've come of age
