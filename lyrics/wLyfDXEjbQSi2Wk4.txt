the writingsannotate are upon the wall
press the like - a - button
like 'em all
let me out
this world is not prepared for some

if living here is healthy then
i should be all dressed again
checking out
shining up my shoes out front
i'm just waiting for my ride to come
get me now

i can't help
but think
i'm wasting time here
holding all my thoughts
and screams
inside this locket
i hope that you don't

find me changing face sometimes
peeling off the lashes stuck to my skin
patience always wearing thin
finding all my faith in dark
conflicted
winners always win but since
every now and then
losers get mixed in
now we wanna be number one
the way i think about it

i can't help
but think
i'm wasting time here
holding all my thoughts
and screams
inside this locket
i hope that you don't

drop them
in the gutter where you lost their files
in the gutter where the trash compiles
in the gutter where they cry for air
in the gutter where they understand
in the gutters' where the good times end
in the gutters' where the good times end
in the gutters' where the good times end
in the gutter with the good times

i don't wanna
don't wanna
be like you

i don't wanna
don't wanna
be like you
