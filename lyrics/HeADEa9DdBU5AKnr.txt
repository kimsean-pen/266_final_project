Spiraling nights in the void
Weathered coat and a dagger
If I dream back my youth I can still hear you sing
A voice that will die on a mountain

And I fear that I've stayed here just a little too long

I had to go where you couldn't follow
In my weariness
I still hear you singing in my mind

And all the fortunes they took away

The shifting earth beneath us
The clouds at our feet
The was made a jewel
When at night it did sleep
Nothing to observe

Cast in a trench of fire
I see the sky is a ceiling
And when my heart dies down
I am long gone on the fields of summer's green
Away from fall and famine

I am in every season
The one you have always known
Life did not reward you
So find your way to the river and let go
