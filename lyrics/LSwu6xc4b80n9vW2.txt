Strapped in the mercy seat in Kansas City
She's ringing hells bells from Seattle to Philly
Got an Indiana heart with a lone star state of mind
Black Tooths any worries lines 'em up knocks 'em all back
Well the bad times ain't so mean
When she's sippin gasoline
Raise 'em up, lets fire it up
Tonight is what we make it
You give it up I'll take it
Girl be my heroin
Now let the sin begin
Tonight is what we make it
You give it up I'll take it
Come be my heroin
Now let the sin begin
Let the sin begin
She's down in NOLA, voodoo city U.S. of A
She's out in Vegas shaking sugar daddies in from L.A.
She's got her southern ways dancing on her northern views
She walks a fine line of east coast 'tude and west coast laid back
No the bad times ain't so mean
When she's shooting gasoline
Raise 'em up, lets fire it up
Let the sin begin
Let it in let it in
She makes the hard times easy
She's my, she's my heroin
