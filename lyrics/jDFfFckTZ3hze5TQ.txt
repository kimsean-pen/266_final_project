All Day and All Night,
My Eyes Are Open,
All Day and All Night,
I've Been Goin,
All Day and All Night,
We Stay Up, We Stay On,
All Day and All Night,
Oh Yeah...
Well I don't know just where I've been,
Same clothes on my back again,
And if you see me in the morning,
You're bound to see me hanging by a thread,
One more time before I go,
One more night before I know,
And if you see me in the evening,
You're bound to see me out of my head,
And I'll Be Going,
All Day and All Night,
Eyes Are Open,
All Day and All Night,
Keep Me Goin,
All Day and All Night,
We Stay Up, We Stay On,
All Day and All Night,
Whisper words into my ear,
Tell me what I need to hear,
But I won't close my eyes without you,
Even if I have to make it one more day,
Never know when to say when,
The sun is setting once again,
And underneath the stars behind us,
the morning comes and washes us away,
Then I'll be going,
All Day and All Night,
Eyes Are Open,
All Day and All Night,
Keep Me Goin,
All Day and All Night,
We Stay Up, We Stay On,
All Day and All Night,
Keep Going
Keep going through the day,
over and over,
Keep going through the night,
All Day and All Night,
All Day and All Night,
All Day and All Night,
All Day and All Night,
All Day and All Night,
Eyes Are Open,
All Day and All Night,
Keep Me Goin,
All Day and All Night,
We Stay Up, We Stay On,
All Day and All Night,
Oh Yeah...

End.
