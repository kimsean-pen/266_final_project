People say
Don't ever look behind
Happiness is just a state of mind
Rock and roll lives and breathes in the hearts of the young

So carry on
You're runnin' on borrowed time
Tryin' hard to survive
Keep on runnin'
Your time [Incomprehensible]
Keep your dreams alive

Follow your heart
(You got to follow your heart)
Living for the day, forget about tomorrow
Follow your heart
(You got to follow your heart)
Any other way can only lead to sorrow
Don't wait any longer
Follow your heart

Plays for keeps
And try to never lose
Live it fast but live the life you choose
Rock and roll lives and breathes in the hearts of the young

So let it ride
Each time you roll the dice
Luck will finally arrive
Keep on runnin'
Your time [Incomprehensible]
Keep your dreams alive

Follow your heart
(You got to follow your heart)
Living for the day, forget about tomorrow
Follow your heart
(You got to follow your heart)
Any other way can only lead to sorrow
Yes I know
You got to let it go

Oh, listen to the rhythm
Your heart won't lie
Rock and roll hearts
Just never die, never die

Follow your heart
(You got to follow your heart)
Living for the day, forget about tomorrow
Follow your heart
(You got to follow your heart)
Any other way can only lead to sorrow

Follow your heart
(It's all rock and roll)
Follow your heart
(Well, it's never gonna die, never die, never gonna die)

Follow your heart
(You got to follow your heart)
In any other way, any other way tomorrow
Follow your heart
(You got to follow your heart)
In any other way to survive
Follow your heart
(You got to follow your heart)
