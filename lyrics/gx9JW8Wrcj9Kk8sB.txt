I've fallen in love with you
Please, tell me, tell me what else was there to do
When feelin lips like yours and looking into eyes like yours
Oh, I might as well face it
Cause it's true
Yes, I've fallen in love with you

Oh, my beating heart wants you
And my empty arms need you
Don't you go, please stay
And never try to send me away

I've fallen in love with you (ooh baby, please stay)
I've fallen in love with you

I've fallen in love with you
And you've just got to feel the same way too
When you embraced me last night
Lord knows it was pure, such pure delight

Oh, my beating heart wants you
And my empty arms need you
Don't you go, please stay
And never try to send me away

Oh yes, my love
Oh yes, my love
My darlin
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen in love

I've fallen so deep in love you see
Until you become the very soul of me
Let me tell you something,
I don't care enough anyway
All over, hey, all over my face it shows
Said I'm talkin bout love this time
Oh, yes I am
And you know what?
It's not a schoolgirl crush

Oh no, no [x12]

Ooh, baby, yea
Oh my beating heart wants you
And my empty arms need you
Don't you go, please stay
And never try to send me away
My beating heart wants you
And my empty arms need you
Don't you go, please stay
And never try to send me away

I've fallen in love with you (yes, my love)
I've fallen in love with you (in love with you, in love with you)
