Cross yourself out and spend your days away from me
The way I hold myself I can't make the change that you want from me
Too much time wasted driving myself away, from behind happy and content with who I am
You're worth more than I can offer
Worth more than everything I have to give away
Worth more than I can offer
More than everything I have to give away
I've ruined what you have seen in me, ruined the person I could have been
I've thrown it all away, how dare you speak my name
I've thrown it all away

Standing in my own grave I swear I've been here once or maybe more times before
I can't go through with what you want me to
I've made my bed and don't think I'll make it to see the morning sun
Eve though the seasons change, we all stay the same
Eve though the seasons change, we all stay the same

I've ruined what you have seen in me, ruined the person I could have been
I've thrown it all away
I've thrown it all away

Kill the doubt inside your heart
Kill the voice that fills your broken head
Kill the memories of everything that we ever shared
I love you more than life, but you're killing yourself

Kill the doubt inside your heart
Kill the voice that fills your broken head
Kill the memories of everything that we ever shared
I love you more than life, but you're killing yourself

I love you more than life, but you're killing yourself
I love you more than life, but you're killing yourself
I love you more than life, but you're killing yourself
