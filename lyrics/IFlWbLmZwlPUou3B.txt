Consumed in a vortex, beheld the celestial wrath
With our spirits aligned, we immersed in evenfall
Engrossed in infinity, congealed in perpetual spleen
In consciousness remained, the universe's final call

At the edge of time, a convergent entity

Erased in blackness, obtained eternal path
In our shivers sublime, we collapsed in crimson sprawl
Enthralled in sparkling loss, transcend in eternal gleam
Annihilation unbound, in maenadic velocity
Rise, convergent black star, revive from life into decay

Dissolve in cosmic seas, enthralled to strain the burden
As an anthem of life and death, as an epitaph of all light

Solo: R. Trujillo S. Kummerer

Our last funeral, redeemed sustaining the vortex
Drowning down eclectic bliss, we remain relieved in deliverance
