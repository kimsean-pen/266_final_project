You humble my bones
You make me feel alive again.
You humble my bones,
You make me feel alive again.

I took a bus to my own place,
It took a while, it took a while.
Where sun shines at an angle,
The leaves are falling, falling.

The words "aren't you read'",
I'm cycling to remember.
So fast, I'm cycling for a place.
I'm just a frown line
A little frown line,
The little frown line
That appears on your face.

I'm just a frown line
A little frown line,
The little frown line
That appears on your face.

I ride to Poland to quench my soul,
So eat us up now. I'm filling up with yellow.
It's now or never,
The sky is blue, I can taste the colours.
Right o', right over here (Right over here)
Right o', right over here.
Desert me in this mobed.

You humble my bones,
You humble my bones,
You humble my bones,
You make me feel alive again.

You humble my bones,
You humble my bones,
You humble my bones,
You make me feel alive again.

You humble my bones,
You humble my bones,
You humble my bones,
You make me feel alive again.

You humble my bones,
You humble my bones,
You humble my bones,
You make me feel alive again.
