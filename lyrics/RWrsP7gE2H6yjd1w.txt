I once fell in love with you
Just because the sky
Turned from grey
Into blue

I once fell in love with you
Just because the sky
Turned from grey
Into blue

I once fell in love with you
Just because the sky
Turned from grey
Into blue

I once fell in love with you
Just because the sky
Turned from grey
Into blue

It was a good friday
The streets were open and empty
No more passion play
On St. Nicholas avenue
I believe in St. Nicholas
It's a different type of Santa Claus
