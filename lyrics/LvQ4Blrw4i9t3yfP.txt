(joan jett/kim fowley)

I want something bad and nice - hot love
I want it nice from paradise - your love
All night long I'm chasing fast - true love
Make me scream, make it fast

We lovers never say goodbye
We lovers never die
We stop and go so quietly
Cold lovers fade away

I'm the one for you
You know what I say is true
I won't cry to tell you why
I know that you love me too
You do a 1, 2, 3, 4
Oh yeah come on now

I want a kiss wet and real - strong love
I wanna tell you how I feel - right now
All night long it rained and rained - my love
Make me scream hey what's your name?

We lovers never say goodbye
We lovers never die
We stop and go so quietly
Cold lovers fade away
