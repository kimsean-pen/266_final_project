Welcome home

Mother Nature is a coward, Mother Nature is a whore
No more presence, no more power, I pray for death by the hour
Cut another smile into me, into me is all you are
My artifice won't recognize me, you won't find me anymore

Post-traumatic war machines, the pessimists still won't believe
Throw away my past mistakes, it's all I can to feel
Let my weapons be you children, let my armies be your damned
Try to suffer on in silence, try to stop me if you can

Pneumatic destroyer, pathetic seducer, distortion sufficient
Someday, one day we'll live our lives again

My ghosts have found their way back home
I have every right to kill my own, every right to kill my own
I am something now that never could exist
My anguish conquers all, pay the price and watch me fall
My only key is broken, my broken key is only me

Pneumatic destroyer, pathetic seducer, distortion sufficient
Someday, one day we'll live our lives again

You utter waste of tired flesh
It doesn't matter if you can't progress
Even now they still create me
Give me your ignorance, irritate me
I am made of the same debris
You want it all, but you didn't want me
Hypocrite with no real use
I'm alive, what's your excuse?

Pneumatic destroyer, pathetic seducer, distortion sufficient
Someday, one day we'll live our lives again
Pneumatic destroyer, pathetic seducer, distortion sufficient
Someday, one day we'll live our lives again
We'll live our lives again
