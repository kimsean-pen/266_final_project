I want to reach out and touch the sky
I want to touch the sun but I don't need to fly
I'm gonna climb up every mountain of the moon
Find the dish that ran away with the spoon

I've crossed the ocean, turned every bend
I found the plastic at the gold at rainbow's end
I've been through magic and through life's reality
I've lived a thousand years and it never bothered me

Got no religion, don't need no friends
Got all I want and I don't need to pretend
Don't try to reach me, 'cause I'll tear up your mind
I've seen the future and I've left it behind
