I'm getting dizzy here
Running in circles
Holding onto your coat tails

Cupids been busy
Still shooting his arrows
While I follow the love trail

They led me straight to you
And all I had to do
Was look in my tracks and double back
I turn around and look what I found

All this time I've been running in circles
You were right behind
I guess I could've met you in the middle
How come it never crossed my mind?

Humming birds around my head
Humming birds around my head
I ran into your arms
Wound up dizzy instead

Now I got butterflies, blue jays
Pretty things in the air out there
Ever since I found there's been
Humming birds around my head

He's so tricky, yeah
Coming full circle
I always knew how to get there

And he was so picky that
He took his eye off the sparrow
Flew out after the nightingale

And had fun for a while
He took them fast and lost his style
Circled his tracks, double back
Turned around and look what you found

All this time I've been running in circles
You were right behind
I guess I could've met you in the middle
How come it never crossed my mind?

Humming birds around my head
Humming birds around my head
I ran into your arms
Wound up dizzy instead

Now I got butterflies, blue jays
Pretty things in the air out there
Ever since I found there's been
Humming birds around my head

I got tiny little bee stings on my heart
Where the love blooms
Honey, can I only be with you?

Sitting underneath the shade tree
In the park where I first met you
Funny how the light can change your view, oh

Humming birds around my head
Humming birds around my head
I ran into your arms
Wound up dizzy instead

Now I got butterflies, blue jays
Pretty things in the air out there
Ever since I found there's been
Humming birds around my head

Humming birds, humming birds
I ran into your arms
So dizzy instead

Butterflies, blue jays
Oh, in the air out there
Ever since I felt there's been
Humming birds around my head
