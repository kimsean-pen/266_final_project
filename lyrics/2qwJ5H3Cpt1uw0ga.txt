This is no good way out
But it's a challange or so I see it
Death's head upon my wall
Afields lies nothing but disorder

No good can come of this
Whatsoever I can tell you
No good will ever come of this
To road to happiness I never knew

I read a letter I never sent
And saw me smiling on a picture
This is nothing I remember
Whatever made me feel so

There are children
On the freeway
I have my ways
Playing with death

No good can come of this
Whatsoever I can tell you
No good will ever come of this
To road to happiness I never knew
