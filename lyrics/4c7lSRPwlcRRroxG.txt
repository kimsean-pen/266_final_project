I found the whole thing out
As I was on my way
So much pain to please you
If we could work it out
I know I'd be alone
There's no time left to please you

Shame
As I was coming undone
When will time release you?
No
I just can't do it alone
So much life deceives you

You knew forever burned
Into my sanity
Now it's hard to please you
If we could fall apart, you know we'd die alone
There's no time left to please you

Shame
As I was coming undone
When will time release you?
No
I just can't do it alone
So much life deceives you

You are the only one
The only one that you don't know
Yes you're the only one
The only one that you don't love (love)

I'm so far gone
It's over now
Took everything
Till you're not there

I'm so far gone
It's over now
Took everything
Till you're not there
(Took everything)

Shame
As I was coming undone
When will time release you?
No
I just can't do it alone
So much life deceives you
Shame

When will time release you?
No
I just can't do it alone
So much life deceives you
