Good morning Mr. Crenshaw, are you free?

First stop, second floor.
You might find just what you're looking for.

Rockafeller, get your dollars at the door.

At 7 at the back of the store.
(keep you) inside his mind, (and his) body broad.
gotta stick it, gonna click it when I want.

I won't pretend that the
one thing that interests me
is personality.
Oh no, it's all about the

No need to flash money.

At the dressing room to see if you're my size.

Refund my credit if you didn't satisfy.
