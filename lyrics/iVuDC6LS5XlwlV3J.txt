Maybe you're lost,
Maybe you're scared,
Maybe you're lonely,
Or you haven't got there yet,

You're falling apart,
Come away at the seams,
Even when you're wide awake,
You're drowning in your dreams,

It's a wonder you don't know how wonderful you are,
so maybe I should show you now

That you have a halo
you have a halo
you have a halo
but maybe you don't know,
you have a halo
you have a halo
you have a halo
but maybe you don't know,

what is the use
of just giving in?
you know that if you keep this up
you'll be more scars than skin
maybe once in a while
I could help you
because they say a problem shared is a problem cut in two

It's a wonder you don't know how wonderful you are,
so maybe I should show you now

That you have a halo
you have a halo
you have a halo
but maybe you don't know,
you have a halo
you have a halo
you have a halo
but maybe you don't know.
