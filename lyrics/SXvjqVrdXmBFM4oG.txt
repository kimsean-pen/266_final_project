I don't love anyone
You're not listening
You're playing with something
You're playing with yourself

I don't love anyone
You're not listening even now
Playing with something
You're playing with someone else

There's one thing that I learned when I was still a child
It's to take a hiding

I don't love anything
And not even Christmas
Especially not that
I don't love anything

I don't love anyone
Well, maybe my sister
Maybe my baby brother too, yeah
I don't love anyone

If there's one thing that I learned when I was still a child
It's to take a hiding

If there's one thing that I learned when I was still a child
It's to be alone

If there's one thing that I learned when I was still a child
It's to take a hiding

Out in the street today
The kids are playing, having fun
But I pass them by, I'm not a kid, no
I don't love anyone

I met a man today
And he told me something pretty strange
There's always somebody saying something
He said, "The world is as soft as lace"

But I don't love anyone
I don't love anyone
I don't love anyone
I don't love anyone

I don't love anyone
I don't love anyone
I don't love anyone
I don't love anyone

If there's one thing that I learned when I was still a child
It's to take a hiding
