Call it liberation or frustration,
As it hits like a bomb.
Tearing you apart as you're first in line,
Entering the zone.

Watch how it runs,
A nerve wrecking resistance.
Watch how it burns,
A venomous script's getting formed.

You've traveled a long way to get here,
And now its waking you up...
Waking you up!

Walk straight, for a final solution.
Walk straight, don't you be so cold.
Walk straight, with a clear resolution.
I'll state my case and never turn.

Watch how it runs, watch how it burns,
And its all a deception.
Break it and learn, there's no return,
For a presence like mine.

You've traveled a long way to get here.
Its getting all so clear now all the things I know,
An elapse of conscious progress will last forevermore.

My courageous insanity follows,
An infinite time.
I'll be attaching the world,
On my shoulders.
Without a look inside,
Inside.

Walk straight, for a final solution.
Walk straight, don't you be so cold.
Walk straight, with a clear resolution.
I'll state my case and never turn.
Walk straight, for a final solution.
Walk straight, don't you be so cold.
Walk straight, with a clear resolution.
