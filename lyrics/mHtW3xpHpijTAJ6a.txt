Some people think they jive me
But I know they must be crazy
Don't see dey misfortune
Guess they just too lazy

J'suis le Grand Zombie
My yellow belt of choison
Ain't afraid of no tom cat
Fill my brains with poison

Walk thru the fire
Fly thru the smoke
See my enemy
At the end of dey rope

Walk on pins and needles
See what they can do
Walk on guilded splinters
With the King of the Zulu

Kon killy killy kon kon
Walk on guilded splinters

'Ti Alberta ('ti Alberta) ('ti Alberta) ('ti Alberta)

I rolled out my coffin
Drink poison in my chalice
Pride begins to fade
And y'all feel my malice

Put gris-gris on your doorstep
Soon you'll be in the gutter
Melt your heart like butter
A-a-and I can make you stutter

Kon killy killy kon kon
Walk on guilded splinters
Kon killy killy kon kon
Walk on guilded splinters

'Ti Alberta ('ti Alberta) ('ti Alberta) ('ti Alberta)

Kon killy killy kon kon
Walk on guilded splinters
(repeat for most of the rest of the song)

Coco Robichaux
Come on down to my soiree
Bring your parain, your Marie, your Mamie, your Dondi, your cousin
and the whole family
No fine de cose bonne?
La jovial la chandelle?
Se la fais la carabas?
Coco Robichaux
Coco Robichaux
Padre diablo?
Gran come the bride?

With your Coco Robichaux
With your Coco Robichaux

'Ti Alberta ('ti Alberta) ('ti Alberta) ('ti Alberta)

'Ti Alberta ('ti Alberta) ('ti Alberta) ('ti Alberta)

Kon killy killy kon kon
Walk on guilded splinters
Kon killy killy kon kon
Walk on guilded splinters

Coco Robichaux
Dine at the soiree on the bayou...
(goes on in this vein for the rest of the song)
