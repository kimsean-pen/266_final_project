Broken hearts and lonely eyes
What I'd give to turn back time
Never thought we
Were walking on ice so thin

You were the one that I admired
We talked slow, watched the burning sky
Two hearts beating fast but my mind told me
This was not gonna last

And I let you go
'Cause we lost our balance
And turned all this to a mess
Time goes by, I can't lie
I miss you

Oh, you and me, we're meant to be
When I'm sad, you are my remedy
When everything is lost, everything is gone
I'm still loving you

Oh, you and me, we're meant to be
When I'm sad, you are my remedy
When everything is lost, everything is gone
I'm still loving you

We set on fire all we had
We brought a storm to this land
But the pain disappeared along with my fears
When I touched your lips

Now it's like we roll the dice
Who will lose and who will fight
We both want to stay but in front of you
I'm the one who's afraid

And I let you go
'Cause we lost our balance
And turned all this to a mess
Time goes by, I can't lie
I miss you

Try to fix this, try to learn
Oh, it always hurts
My wildest dreams take me to you
Can we make it through

Oh, you and me, we're meant to be
When I'm sad, you are my remedy
When everything is lost, everything is gone
I'm still loving you

Oh, you and me, we're meant to be
When I'm sad, you are my remedy
When everything is lost, everything is gone
I'm still loving you

Oh, you and me, we're meant to be
When I'm sad, you are my remedy
When everything is lost, everything is gone
I'm still loving you
