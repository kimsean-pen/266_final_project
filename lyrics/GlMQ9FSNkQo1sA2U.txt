We were walking on Sparkes Street growing up real fast
I left it behind pretty quickly, still the farthest thing from pretty
I found comfort, I fell in love with avoiding problems
We were riding on Smith Street we were right on track
I left it behind without sinking, they all said I wasn't thinking
I found comfort, I fell in love with avoiding problems
But I want this, you know I want this
So come on, mess me up
And you can break me if you'll still take me
Ruin me, if you'll let me be one of the ones you say you won't forget
'Cause I want this, you know I want this
So come on, mess me up
I was stumbling on Suffolk throwing up real hard
Inside was kind of misty, I knew none of the history
I found comfort, I fell in love with avoiding problems
And that was the problem
'Cause I want this, you know I want this
So come on, mess me up
And you can break me if you'll still take me
Ruin me, if you'll let me be one of the ones you say you won't forget
'Cause I want this, you know I want this
So come on, mess me up
'Cause I want this, you know I want this
So come on, mess me up
