Embrace this sickness with open arms
If you believe you'll run with ghosts.
Pull out the arrows that poison your mind
Look inside and ask yourself why
Why would you really want to live forever
Every breath expelled together

In faith alone in place apart
Be there to meet your maker

Raise your eyes from sleep
Together you will be searching
The answers will never come

And I can't pretend anymore to be a part of this
And I'll leave my burdens at the door
But I'll never walk here again
