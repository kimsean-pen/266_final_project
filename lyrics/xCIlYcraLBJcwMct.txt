There's nothing I can't face
So open the floodgates
No fear of what's to come
I'm not going under
Not running for cover
Standing against the sun

After the fire
After the flames
Nothing'll feel the same
My scars are closing
My heart is open
I am not afraid

I'm ready to breathe again
I'm beginning to catch my breath
I'm ready to dream again
Surviving what left me for dead
I had to bleed
To lose
Find myself to prove
I could feel love without you
I'm all that I have
I am the aftermath

Show it no mercy
'Cause it cannot hurt me
No more will I bite my tongue
Tired and worthless
Fighting with purpose
No longer will I stay numb

After the fire
After the flames
Nothing will feel the same
My scars are closing
My heart is open
I am not afraid

I'm ready to breathe again
I'm beginning to catch my breath
I'm ready to dream again
Surviving what left me for dead
I had to bleed
To lose
Find myself to prove
I could feel love without you
I'm all that I have
I am the aftermath

Break my bones
You will see
You can't kill me
You can't kill me

Break my bones
You will see
You can't kill me
You can't kill me

You can't kill me

I'm ready to breathe again
I'm beginning to catch my breath
I'm ready to dream again
Surviving what left me for dead
I had to bleed
To lose
Find myself to prove
I could feel love without you
I'm all that I have
I'm all that I have
I'm all that I have
I am the aftermath
I am the aftermath

Break my bones
You will see
You can't kill me
You can't kill me

Break my bones
You will see
You can't kill me
You can't kill me
