If every angel's terrible
Then why do you welcome them?
If every angel's terrible
Then why do you welcome them?
If every angel's terrible
Then why do you welcome them?
You say you'll provide the birdbath
If I provide the skin
And bathing in the moonlight
I'm to tremble like a kitten

If blue eyed babes raised as Hitler's little brides and sons
They got angelic tendencies
Like some boys tend to act like queens
If every angel's terrible
Then why do you watch her sleep?
Love to hear her sing and wear purple eyes like rings
And the flowers have no scent
And the child's been miscarried

If every angel's terrible
Then why do you welcome them?
If every angel's terrible
Then why do you welcome them?
If every angel's terrible
Then why do you welcome them?
You say you'll provide the birdbath
If I provide the skin
And bathing in the moonlight
I'm to tremble like a kitten

Oh, every angel's terrible
Said Freud and Rilke all the same
Rimbaud never paid them no mind
But Jimmy Morrison had his elevators
His elevators, he had his elevator angels

If every angel's terrible
Why do you hide inside her?
Like a child in a skirt
The supermarket's loud and bright
Boy, don't she feel warm tonight
Boy, don't she feel warm tonight
Boy, don't she feel warm tonight

If every angel's terrible
Then why do you welcome them?
If every angel's terrible
Then why do you welcome them?
If every angel's terrible
Why do you welcome them?
You say you'll provide the birdbath
If I provide the skin

She sounded like an angel when she cried
