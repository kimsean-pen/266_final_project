Dreaming, dreaming of it
Like it's yesterday.
Sing it, sing all of it
Like it's yesterday, feels like yesterday.
Climbing over the wall,
Go wherever we wanted.
Then run away from the law,
Do whatever we gotta.
You say "Remember me, remember me
When I'm no longer, promise me"
If you're happy don't let it go,
If you're not happy you shouldn't have to settle
If it matters you take it on
If it matters at all.
And I won't be that lump in your throat
Hold back the dark
Just, hold back the dark
And go further, further, further, further
When it's falling apart in your very arms
Hold back the dark
Can you hold back the dark?
And go further, further, further, further
Waiting, waiting for you.
Now that I've got myself
Waisting you went on the
time I cracked my head on the night you went
jumping into your car
Driving home from the country
Found me in the hospital
Telling me not to worry
You say "Remember me, remember me.
When I'm no longer, promise me"
If you're happy don't let it go
If you're not happy you shouldn't have to settle
If it matters you take it forward
If it matters at all
And I won't be that lump in your throat
Hold back the dark
Just hold back the dark
And go further, further, further, further
When it's falling apart in your very arms then
Hold back the dark
Can you hold back the dark?
And go further, further, further, further
Falling apart, it's falling apart
You promised me, you promised me
Falling apart, it's falling apart
You promised me, you promised me
If it matters at all, it matters at all
You'd pick up the pieces and put it together
"Remember me, remember me"
Remember me.
Hold back the dark
Hold back the dark
And you're further, further, further, further
When it's falling apart in yours very arms then
Hold back the dark
Can you hold back the dark?
And go further, further, further, further
Light up the dark
Do you?
Light up the dark
Go further, further
Light up the dark
do you?
Light up the dark
Go further, further
Light up the dark star
Can you do that?
Can you do that?
Light up the dark, girl
Further, further, further, further
Light up the dark star
Can you do that?
Can you do that?
Light up the dark star
Can you do that?
Can you do that all?
