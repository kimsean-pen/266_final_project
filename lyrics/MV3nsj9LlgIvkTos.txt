This air is too thick to breathe, so just drive
These eyes are too sick to see, don't leave me behind
There's something swimming in my blood, something's rotting in my brain
Limbs smothered from the flood, I can't recognize your face
I need to leave so just drive

Burning lights on the street, I'm fight, fighting the gravity
When I'm beat and defeated, they'll take you away from me
Dead and lost in a dream, this, this is the last of me
I'm always fighting the gravity

Tonight is too much for me to get through
Tomorrow's just a darkened hall to an empty room
When I'm far away from you

Burning lights on the street, I'm fight, fighting the gravity
When I'm beat and defeated, they'll take you away from me
Dead and lost in a dream, this, this is the last of me
I'm always fighting the gravity

I'm always fighting the gravity
