Your lipstick
Smeared beside
I adore you
I always have
And everytime you overdose
I rush to intensive care
Another said I stare
Before you disappear

If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then, save it me baby
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then, save it me baby

Ooh, ooh
Then save it for me baby
Ooh, ooh
Then, save it me baby

Your addiction
And you are in love
Not starcrossed
I wait my turn
And everytime you overdoes
I rush to Intensive Care
Another said I stare
Before you disappear

If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then, save it me baby
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then, save it me baby

Ooh, ooh
Then save it for me baby
Ooh, ooh
Then, save it for me baby

I wanna know, I wanna know
If it's the last, if it's the last
Dance
I wanna know, I wanna know
Baby, baby, please

If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then, save it me baby
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then, save it me baby

Ooh
Then save it for me baby
Ooh (This is the last dance, this is the last dance)
Then, save it for me baby
