Tell me whose side you're on
Tell me whose side you're on
You're on, you're on
Tell me whose side you're on

You have some nerve showing your face here
It had been so long,
I thought you'd disappeared
Why'd you pretend that we're still so close
It was all too clear,
We need love

Well damn girl, since you've come around, girl
I need to know right now so, won't you just
Tell me whose side you're on
Lately, I've thought the chance that maybe
You could become my baby,
If you just
Tell me whose side you're on

Tell me whose side you're on
Tell me whose side you're on
You're on, you're on
Tell me whose side you're on

It's been so long since I heard your thing
I was losing hope, thought you felt the same
And it's been so long since I've seen your face
Doubting my own mind,
That I'd been replaced

But damn girl, since you've come around, girl
I need to know right now so, won't you just
Tell me whose side you're on
Lately, I've thought the chance that maybe
You could become my baby
If you just
Tell me whose side you're on

Tell me whose side you're on
Tell me whose side you're on
You're on, you're on
Tell me whose side you're on

But damn girl, since you've come around, girl
I need to know right now so, won't you just
Tell me whose side you're on
Lately, I've thought the chance that maybe
If you just
Tell me whose side you're on
