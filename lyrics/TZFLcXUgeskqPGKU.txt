Love doesn't ask why
It speaks from the heart
And never explains
Don't you know that love
Doesn't think twice
It can come all at once
Or whisper from a distance

Don't ask me if this feeling's right or wrong
It doesn't have to make much sense
It just has to be this strong
‘Cause when you're in my arms I understand
We don't have a voice
When our hearts make the choices
There's no plan
It's not in our hands

Love doesn't ask why
It speaks from the heart
And never explains
Don't you know that love
Doesn't think twice
It can come all at once
Or whisper from a distance

Now I can feel what you're afraid to say
If you give your soul to me
Will you give too much away
But we can't let this moment pass us by
Can't question this chance
Or expect any answers
We can try
Maybe we can try

(Love doesn't ask why)
(It speaks from the heart)
And never explains
Don't you know that love
Doesn't think twice
It can come all at once
Or whisper from a distance

So let's take what we found
And wrap it around us

Love doesn't ask you why
It speaks from the heart
Don't you know, don't you know that love
Baby
Love doesn't ask why
It speaks from the heart
And never explains
Don't you know that love
Doesn't think twice
It comes all at once
Whisper from a distance

Love doesn't ask you why
