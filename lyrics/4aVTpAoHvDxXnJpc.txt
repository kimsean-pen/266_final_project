When it came to words like "I surrender"
I didn't do what I would pray
Living my life watching the weather
Wasting time and chasing fate
I look at the life I'd been designing
Waiting around for my breakthrough
But I'm pushing my dreams to the side of me
'Cause they can't love me like You do

I give You my all
I give You my all
And I'm not running anymore
I give You my all
I'm giving You all of me, all of me
Oh, I give You my all
Yeah, I'm not running anymore
I give You my all
I'm giving You all of me, all of me

Father
I need You to search my heart
Coming on back to surrender
Show me where to start, yeah
All I want is to be abiding
'Cause You show me a different view
What I had was less exciting
'Cause dreams don't love me like You do

I give You my all
Hey
I give You my all
I'm not running anymore
No, no, no, no
I give You my all
I'm giving You all of me, all of me
Oh-oh, I give You my all
And I'm not running anymore
No, no, no, no
I give You my all
I'm giving You all of me, all of me

Pause
why would I make plans
Push away Your hand?
Alone I can't stand
Stop
Your plan is my choice
Tune out all the noise
I can hear Your voice
And I don't wanna run
I don't want control
And I don't wanna run
I don't want control
No, no, no

I give You my all
I give You my all
And I'm not running anymo-o-ore
I give You my all
I'm giving You all of me, all of me
Oh, I give You my all
Yeah, I'm not running anymore
No, no, no, no
I give You my all
I'm giving You all of me, all of me
