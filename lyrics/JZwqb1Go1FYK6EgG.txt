Tall tale, such a damn shame
Hindsight, I can see it all so plain
Kamikaze, fire come down
Fire come down, fire-fire come down
Left, right, nowhere to turn
I'm left in the ash from the bridges you burned
Kamikaze, fire come down
Fire come down, fire-fire come down

(Ah) It's too late for apologies
(Ah) Nothing you can offer me now
(Ah) I'm looking at you on your knees
(Ah) And I'm all listened out

Call, call, call
But I'm never gonna come
Baby cry, cry, cry
You ain't fooling anyone
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar
You can crawl, crawl, crawl
You can beg and you can plead
Baby talk, talk, talk
Keep on lying through your teeth
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar

I hear you all night talk in your sleep
Saying all kind of names but none of them me
Keeping secrets under your sheets
Under you sheets, under-under your sheets
You can cry wolf
But you know I ain't gonna be here tomorrow, oh no
I ain't fucking with you dirty, dirty, dirty laundry
Dirty laundry, dirty-dirty laundry

(Ah) It's too late for apologies
(Ah) Nothing you can offer me now
(Ah) I'm looking at you on your knees
(Ah) And I'm all listened out

Call, call, call
But I'm never gonna come
Baby cry, cry, cry
You ain't fooling anyone
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar
You can crawl, crawl, crawl
You can beg and you can plead
Baby talk, talk, talk
Keep on lying through your teeth
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar

So here we go
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
So here we go
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Here we go (you're a liar, a liar)

You can call, call, call
But I'm never gonna come
Baby cry, cry, cry
You ain't fooling anyone
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar
You can crawl, crawl, crawl
You can beg and you can plead
Baby talk, talk, talk
Keep on lying through your teeth
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar

So here we go
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
You're a liar, a liar
