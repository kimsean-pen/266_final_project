My soul starts spinning again
I can't stop feeling
No, I won't stop feeling
And the fun's not fun anymore
I can't stop feeling
No, I won't stop feeling

You leave me here on my own
You leave me here on the floor
You can't feel it
You can't feel it
You can't feel it
You can't feel anymore

Feel anymore
Feel anymore
Feel anymore

My soul starts stinging again
I can't stop feeling
No, I don't stop feeling
And we're not 'us' anymore
I can't stop
No, I won't stop

And you leave me dancing alone
You leave me to die on the floor
You can't feel it
You can't feel it
You can't feel it
You can't feel anymore

Feel anymore
Feel anymore
Feel anymore

So boy, you're down and alone
Your soul is broken again
But you can't stop movin'
No you won't stop movin' at all

You can't feel it
You can't feel it
You can't feel it
You can't feel anymore

(Can't feel it) anymore
(Can't feel it) anymore
(Can't feel it) anymore
You can't feel anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
You can't feel anymore
