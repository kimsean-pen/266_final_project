I wanna be a billionaire so freacking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night oh
I swear the world better prepare

For when I'm a billionaire
Yeah I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas
Give Artie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had sh-t
Give away a few Mercedes like here lady have this
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
Its been a couple months since I've single so
You can call me Artie Claus minus the Ho Ho
Get it, hehe, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah can't forget about me stupid

Everywhere I go Imma have my own theme music
Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night oh
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh for when I'm a Billionaire

Oh oooh oh oooh (let's go!)
I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli'n in the air just for the hell of it
But keep the fives, twentys, hiz n' biz completely separate
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatevers left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet

And put it in the air and sing
I wanna be a billionaire so freacking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I'll buy EVERYTHING!

Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh every time I close my eyes

I see my name in shining lights

Yeah eeeh (oh what else, man?) different city every night oh
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh (sing it!) for when I'm a Billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh (oh!)
I wanna be a billionaire so freackin bad
