All you hippies better start to face reality,
All your far fetched dreams of anarchy,
Better start to see things the way they are,
Cause the way things
Are going they won't be goin' far.

World peace can't be done.
It just can't exist.
World peace can't be done.
Anarchy's a mess.

Things are gettin hectic.
It's all gonna end.
You don't know what's waitin' up around the bend.
Open your eyes, perhaps you'll realize.
If aids don't get ya then the warheads will.

World peace can't be done!
World peace!
It just can't exist.
World peace!
World peace can't be done.

Anarchy's a mess!

World peace!
No it can't.
World peace!
It just won't exist.
World peace! world peace! world peace!
