"Velvet Heart"

Like cold breath writhing in despair
These lonely souls never disappear
Like a mission nobody wants to share
This curse will never disappear

Velvet Heart
Poison reaches my veins when you caress me
Im not alone
A deadly kiss in the dark

Your velvet heart
The ashes of love buried in the past
A Masquerade of lonely torn-apart souls

Like marble halls in winter's sphere
Im breathing you wanting me
Within these never-ending walls
These souls will never disappear

Velvet Heart
Poison reaches my veins when you caress me
Im not alone
A deadly kiss in the dark

Your velvet heart
The ashes of love buried in the past
A Masquerade of lonely torn-apart souls

Velvet heart
Velvet heart

Velvet Heart
Poison reaches my veins when you caress me
Im not alone
A deadly kiss in the dark

Your velvet heart
The ashes of love buried in the past
A Masquerade of lonely torn-apart souls

Your velvet heart
The ashes of love buried in the past

Velvet heart
This burning
This yearning
This killing heart
