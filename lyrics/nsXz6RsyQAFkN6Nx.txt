Hello, can you see me
I am standing right here
Hello, are you listening?
Can you hear me?
I am, I am screaming in your ear

I have nothing to fear
I have nothing to say
You have nothing to take this from me
Years of screaming in pain
Years of anger and rage
I will not be your slave

So here we are
This is the end
But all that dies
Is born again
The scars will still remain
From the ashes, I will rise again
Goodbye, hello

Goodbye
I leave you in this moment
It's time to strip you of this hold
Goodbye
I will shed myself of this memory
But you
You won't forget me
I will haunt you til the truth unfolds

So here we are
This is the end
But all that dies
Is born again
The scars will still remain
From the ashes, I will rise again
Goodbye, hello

So here we are
This is the end
But all that dies
Is born again
Hello
