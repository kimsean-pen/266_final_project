There's no angels here
Just a sun to light the way
To places where my friends
Turn to strangers

Oh my lover on a long long empty road
Oh sweet lover I got lost

There's no angels here
Just a light to lead the way
There's no innocence
Only stangers

Oh my lover on a long long empty road
Oh sweet lover I got lost

And I
I need to get back home

Oh my lover on a long long empty road
Oh sweet lover I got lost

And I
I need to get back home
