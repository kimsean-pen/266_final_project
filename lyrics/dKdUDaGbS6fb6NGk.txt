So fucking blow those words out the back of your head
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit
You tell me lies and you give what you get
So blow those fucking words out the back of your head

Oh my god did you just hear?
Lies are coming back in style
Oh my god they seem so real that they bind you and confine you
Shut your mouth we've heard it all
Hypocrites and critics all
Can fuck off we do this for our souls (for our souls)

What they say won't make us go away

So fucking blow those words out the back of your head
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit
You tell me lies and you give what you get
So blow those fucking words out the back of your head

We're not sorry and we won't conform
It's not a choice but something inborn
If we fail following our hearts can you blame us? (no no no)
A square peg in a black hole
We don't fit in, that's the way it goes
You shouldn't act like you're better than us
'Cause you're not (no, no, no)

What they say won't make us go away

So fucking blow those words out the back of your head
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit
You tell me lies and you give what you get
So blow those fucking words out the back of your head
So fucking blow those words out the back of your head
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit
You tell me lies and you give what you get
So blow those fucking words out the back of your head
Blow-blow those fucking words out the back of your head

Tell yourself
You're not alone at all (looking out your window)
(Know you're all alone)
Tell yourself
You're not alone at all (looking out your window)
(Know you're all alone)

What they say won't make us go away
Go away, go away, go away

So fucking blow those words out the back of your head
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit
You tell me lies and you give what you get
So blow those fucking words out the back of your head
So fucking blow those words out the back of your head
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit
You tell me lies and you give what you get
So blow those fucking words out the back of your head
Blow- blow those fucking words out the back of your head
Of your head, of your head, of your head
