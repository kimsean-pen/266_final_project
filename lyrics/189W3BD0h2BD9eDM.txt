I'd find a new purpose if there was one for me
But I can't leave my feelings when the city sleeps
In darkness, in vain, to the very last hour
You will know my pain is real

Yeah, anything to numb
Anything to keep spitting ignorance
Anything to numb
Anything to kill this grief
Yeah, anything to numb, anything to numb
Anything to kill your ghost

Insufficient reactions
Free myself from the every day
And death awaits my touch
Motherfucker

Yeah, anything to numb
Anything to keep spitting ignorance
Anything to numb
Anything to kill this grief
Yeah, anything to numb, anything to numb
Anything to kill your ghost
