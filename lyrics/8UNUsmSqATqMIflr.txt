Curse me out
You're so pretty when you put me down
Darling, every time we scream and shout
I deserve it when you curse me out

One week, I'm gone, we're in the thick of it
On the phone, in the wrong, I've gotta live with it
But why the hell am I in Indiana when it comes out?

I could catch a train home
But you don't really like me much right now

Curse me out
You're so pretty when you put me down
Darling, every time we scream and shout
I deserve it when you curse me out

It's all been done, the air is getting thin
White lies, I'm dumb and feeling sick again
Just think about the time we drove to Portland
And we lost ourselves

I could buy you roses
(I could buy you roses)
Cause you don't really like me much right now
I could buy you roses
(I could buy you roses)
But petals always fall when I'm around

Curse me out
You're so pretty when you put me down
Darling, every time we scream and shout
I deserve it when you curse me out

Put my clothes back on your shelf
Let's forget and think of something else
(something else)
To talk about
Are you crying?
Hang our picture on the wall and forget you tore it down at all
(Down at all)
Don't let us fall
I'm trying
Curse me out

Curse me out
You're so pretty with your hair short now
Darling, every time we scream and shout
I deserve it when you curse me out
Curse me out
You're so pretty when you put me down
Darling, every time we scream and shout
I deserve it when you curse me out

I could buy you roses
But petals always fall when I'm around
