Too much blood on my teeth today
Too much love for you anyway
Desdemona is crying on the grave
Vampires all over the place

And the day and the night
She is like a ghost roaming in the park
I close my eyes
Keep it all inside

Hopefully i put your hand in my hand
I'm afraid i'm shivering like a b movie star
Hopefully i put your hand in my hand
What a dream we're gonna skip the end
Oh tonight

No more flags floating in the air
No more kiss in the pouring rain
Desdemona is running for her life
I know the ghouls they never compromise

And the day and the night
She is like a ghost roaming in the park
I close my eyes
Keep it all inside

Hopefully i put your hand in my hand
I'm afraid i' m shivering like a b movie star
Hopefully i put your hand in my hand
What a dream we're gonna skip the end
Oh tonight
