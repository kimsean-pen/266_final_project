Just bumpin' on the radio
Tell me when you're going to the mall
I'm trying to spend it bro

Yeah, guess they right
Never should've gave ya'll niggas money
Got fat 'cause there used to be nothing in my tummy
Got my foot up in the door and all my niggas coming
And Parker so smart that he got ya'll all dummy
Was pretty bad before, now I'm just reckless
Apple Ciroc for dinner, lunch and breakfast
You know how it goes if you got it better spend it
And if you ain't got it I suggest you go and get it

I ain't going out like Hammer
Can't spare to save my life
But getting money from my Grandma
The boy so charming, I get it from my grammar
Now I ain't got a lot, but it's more than a little bit
Same old Groggs I ain't out here getting ignorant
But I'd be lying though if I said I'm not belligerent

Maybe not a little bit
Okay not even a little bit
You get it? Yeah?
