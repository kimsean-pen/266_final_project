Yeah, yeah
Everything you see, you just can't erase
Everything you love, you'll never replace
Everything you fear, you'll still have to face
You could only have today
If you wanna go, stay
If you wanna run, wait
Everything is ok
We gotta live in the now, cuz we can't go back to yesterday, hey
We gotta live in the now, cuz tomorrow it's too far away, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey
You could never now, where we gonna be
You could plan it out, but it wiil still a mystery
If you let it go, your heart will be free
You can do anything
If you wanna go, stay
If you wanna run, wait
Everything is ok
We gotta live in the now, cuz we can't go back to yesterday, hey
We gotta live in the now, cuz tomorrow it's too far away, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey
Everything that happened in the past, it's just a dream
Everything that happens in the future it's a mystery
Yeah
So if you wanna go, stay
If you wanna run, wait
Everything is ok
We gotta live in the now, cuz we can't go back to yesterday, hey
We gotta live in the now, cuz tomorrow it's too far away, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey
Hey, hey, hey

If you wanna go, stay
If you wanna run, wait
Everything is ok

If you wanna go, stay
If you wanna run, wait
Everything is ok
Cuz we're living today
Hey
Hey, hey, hey
Do now...
Stay...
