Yo, Turn my music up
Up some more, Up some more

Up a little bit more
Mama always told me to be careful who I love
And daddy always told me make sure he's right
I always had my eyes on this one particular guy

I was too shy so I decided to write
I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss (oooohh)
And when I write him he better get it on time
I'm sending him a 4 page letter (ooh yea)
And I enclosed it with a kiss

And when I write him he better get it on time
People always say that I've played myself for you
They say that you don't even notice me (me, me, me)
Baby when I get the nerve to come to you

Promise me that you won't dis me
I'm sending him a 4 page letter (4 page letter)
And I enclosed it with a kiss (a kiss)
And when I write him he better get it on time (oh yea, he better)
I'm sending him a 4 page letter (ooh yes I am)
And I enclosed it with a kiss

And when I write him he better get it on time (ooohh I'm writing you)
I'm writing you a love letter tonight
You better keep watch 'cause the mailman's coming (ohh yes he is, oohhha)
I'm writing you a love letter tonight (tonight)

You better keep watch 'cause the mailman's coming (ooohhh... I...)
I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him he better get it on time (he better)
I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss (a sweet kiss)
And when I write him
He better get it on time
