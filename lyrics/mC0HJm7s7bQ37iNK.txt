So wide you can't get around it
So low you can't get under it
(So low you can't get under it)
So high you can't get over it

Da-yee do do do do do do

This is a chance
This is a chance
To dance your way
Out of your constrictions
(Tell suckah!)
Here's a chance to dance our way
out of our constrictions
Gonna be freakin'
Up and down
Hang-up alley way
With the groove our only guide
We shall all be moved
Ready or not here we come
Gettin' down on
the one which we believe in
One nation under a groove
gettin' down just for the funk
(Can I get it on the good foot)
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
(Good God)
(bout time I got down one time)
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now
Ah ah aye aiii aiiieeeeee

Feet don't fail me now
Givin' you more of what you're funkin' for
Feet don't fail me now
Do you promise to funk?
The whole funk, nothin' but the funk

Ready or not here we come
Gettin' down on the one which we believe in
Here's my chance to dance my way
Out of my constrictions
Do do deeyodo do deeyodo do deeyodo
Do do deeyodo do deeyodo do deeyodo
(You can dance away)

Feet don't fail me now (ha ha)
Here's a chance to dance
Our way out of our constrictions
Gonna be groovin' up and down
Hang up alley way
With the groove our only guide
We shall all be moved

Givin' you more of what you're funkin' for
Feet don't fail me now
