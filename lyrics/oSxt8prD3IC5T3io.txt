When you told me we'd
Be together again
Did you know I believed
In the words you said
Did you think I knew
You've said it to her too?
Oh it's a modern world
Full of people just like you
Are our relationships
Nothing but stalks and bones
Do you calculate
All the friends you have lost
Must we saturate ourselves
It does nothing for you
It does nothing for your help
What can you say
When the world turns grey
It's such a shame
If you'd ask me baby
I'd do anything for you
If you'd ask me baby
I'd do anything for you
It's a modern world
Full of broken scheming hearts
They were filled with words
But we don't need them anymore
It's an egotrough
And it's faster than before
Is there no confidence
Is there no patience anymore
What can you say
When the world turns grey
It's such a shame
If you'd ask me baby
I'd do anything for you
If you'd ask me baby
I'd do anything for you
