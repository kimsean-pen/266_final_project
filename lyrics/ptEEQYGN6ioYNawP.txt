Oh Little girl
don't go away
just come to bed
and there we'll stay,

oh little girl, lie close to me
just close your eyes
what do you see?

Black Cat
entrance me,
devour me

The storm outside is raging still
there's no escape,
the one that kills

oh little girl,
the time has come
we think and move
exist as one

Black Cat
entrance me,
devour me.
