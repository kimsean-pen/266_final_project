Disappear!

I remember the first time
But it wasn't the last time that you told me that
You'd take me back
So I'm still wondering why
It was ever a question
Should've learned my lesson
I keep coming back
Like a heart attack

That's always breaking
I can't let you vanish
There's no magic

When you're gone
You say you don't need me
You say there's something beneath me
I'm not gonna let you disappear (Disappear!)
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear (Disappear!)
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh
Disappear!

I don't wanna be lonely
But you were always the only one
Who cast the spell
And make it feel like
All of this was real
Nothing but an illusion
But I'm not gonna lose ya

So just do your trick
And make it quick
'Cause I'm pretending

I can't let you vanish
There's no magic
When you're gone
You say you don't need me
You say there's something beneath me
I'm not gonna let you disappear (Disappear!)
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear (Disappear!)

Oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Disappear!

Don't go!

I can't let you vanish
There's no magic
When you're gone
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Disappear!

You say you don't need me

You say there's something beneath me
I'm not gonna let you disappear (Disappear!)
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear (Disappear!)
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Disappear! (Disappear!)
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Disappear! (Disappear!)
Don't go!
