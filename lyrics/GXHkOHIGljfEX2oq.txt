I and I are the living dread
Inna these ya dawn of the living dead
I and I are the living dread
Inna these ya dawn of the living dead

Where minds are decreasing, from a distant culture
Where minds are increasing, 'cause we backing off vultures

I and I are the living dread
Inna these ya dawn of the living dead
I and I are the living dread
Inna these ya dawn of the living dead

Blessed be the children of man
Who together will overstand
Blessed be the children of man
As numberless as grain of sand

I and I are the living dread
Inna these ya dawn of the living dead
I and I are the living dread
Inna these ya dawn of the living dead

Some building costly in the hill
While so many others don't never get no share
Depriving a human of their rights
It's a crime against the worst
Do I have to tell you about prison

I and I are the living dread
Inna these ya dawn of the living dead
I and I are the living dread
Inna these ya dawn of the living dead

Where minds are decreasing, from a distant culture
Where minds are increasing, 'cause we backing down vultures

I and I are the living dread
Inna these ya dawn of the living dead
I and I are the living dread
Inna these ya dawn of the living dead

I and I living out there upfull and bright!

I and I are the living dread
Inna these ya dawn of the living dead
I and I heart of the Maroon art
Taught to the Maroon thought
I and I trod the Maroon trod
Inna desolate places

I and I are the living dread
Inna these ya dawn of the living dead
I and I are the living dread
Inna these ya dawn of the living dead
