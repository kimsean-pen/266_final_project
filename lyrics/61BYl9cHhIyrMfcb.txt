I said go
I said baby don't wanna go
I said freeze
I said baby don't wanna freeze

And if it's night or day we don't care
If what we get along whatever you do
And it won't be long till they get my file
And turn it black as black as afternoon
And turn it black as black as afternoon

I said you
I said you and me and her
I said us
I said us makes white a blur

And if it's night or day we don't care
If how we get along whatever you say
And it won't be long till they get my file
And turn it black as black as gray
And turn it black as black as gray

I said you
Well, you do

We don't care if you care for the mob
We don't care if you care for the sub
We don't care if you care for the mud
'Cause we've got Motown blood in our veins
'Cause we've got Motown blood in our veins

I said move
I said baby don't wanna move
I said groove
I said baby don't wanna groove

And if its night or day we don't care
If what we get along whatever you do
And it won't be long till they get my file
And turn it black as black as afternoon
Turn it black as black as afternoon

I said you
Well, you do
I said

We don't care if you care for the mob
We don't care if you care for the sub
We don't care if you care for the mud
'Cause we've got Motown blood in our veins
Yeah, we've got Motown blood in our veins

Yeah, we've got Motown blood in our veins
Yeah, we've got Motown blood in our veins
