A loose, and hazy time
When you were not my Clementine
And I was not your diamond's eye

Bereft, as daisies lie
For our love was not lost in style
You were strong, I was a child

We, we're not kings here,
We're not kings here
We're just strangers

And Love, has died in song
Carried down by ancient tongues
Ferried around the water's thrum
And winds, along a line
Along a whirl, a lonely girl

To be, to see, to sweat, and bleed
To fall on your sword-on your sword
On your word

We, we're not kings here,
We're not kings here
We're just strangers

Be still, by my side
For you are not my Clementine
And I am not your diamond's eye
To Sleep!

By right of you, I can't endure
In the light of things, I can't ignore
In spite of all the rose's thorns, and hopeless works

We, we're not kings here,
We're not kings here
We're just strangers

We, we're not kings here,
We're not the kings here
We're just strangers

We, we're not kings here,
We're not kings here
We're just strangers

We, we're not kings here,
We're not the kings here
We're just strangers
And angels
