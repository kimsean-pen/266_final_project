Finally relax my weary limbs, just lay still
The ceiling undulates, the fault of some strange pill
I see your body in the doorway, so it seems
I must accept my eyes betray these half-dreams
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
The hours to the sunrise creep, but I don't care
There is no hope for any sleep if you're not here
In another scene, in another bed you're sleeping
So won't you come and visit me when I'm dreaming
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
I fear that I'll never sleep again
I fear that I'll never sleep again
I fear that I'll never sleep again
I fear that I'll never sleep again
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
Oh, I need your bedroom eyes
