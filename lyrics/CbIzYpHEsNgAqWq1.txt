Well it's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
Well it's all in your mind

And I wanted to be
I wanted to be
Wanted to be your good friend

Well I cannot believe
You got a devil up your sleeve
And he's talking to me
And I cannot believe

And I wanted to be
I wanted to be your good friend

You're all scared and stiff
A sick stolen gift
And the people you're with
They're all scared and stiff

And I wanted to be
Wanted to be your good friend
