A decade's worth of damage done in unsaid words
We both know that's not what you deserved
There was always love, it was there but never spoken of
You held on when I was not enough

It's a shame, this has taken me so long to say

Hey Rachel, I'm sorry
I was younger and scared when you needed me
I was selfish and stubborn, a terrible brother
You don't have to forgive me
Hey Rachel, I'm sorry

I always knew that I was responsible to guide you through
But I was blind when looking out for you
I was self-absorbed but I try not to be anymore
I put your diary back in your drawer

It's a shame, this has taken me so long to say

Hey Rachel, I'm sorry
I was younger and scared when you needed me
I was selfish and stubborn, a terrible brother
You don't have to forgive me
Hey Rachel, I'm sorry
