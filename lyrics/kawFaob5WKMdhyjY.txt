When once you have believed it
Now you see it's sucking you in
To string you along with the pretense
And pave the way for the coming release

Get innocuous
Get innocuous
Get innocuous

Home, home in the late night
And away, away in the half life
Except Saturday, crushed by the boring
Until plagued, plagued by the tourists

When once you have believed it
Now you see it's sucking you in
To string you along with the pretense
And pave the way for the coming release

Alone, prone in the half light
And late, late to the real life
If you find a way into the gold rush
You will stay until the morning comes
