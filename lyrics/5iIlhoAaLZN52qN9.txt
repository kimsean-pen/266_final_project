I got my head on a dip
And the number four
I probably give my seat to the lady
But I probably need it more
Millionaire dust in the eye
Oh, I wanna say bye bye bye bye

I'm a hard working hand
Yeah I'm a hard working hand
I get a little bit of something
Bones come straight to command
Cause I'm a hard working hand, yeah

Fourteen forty-five
Every second man was no paradise
Some seem happy just to pick up
I am not so happy, got to give myself up

I'm a hard working hand
Yes I'm a hard working hand
Yes a get a little something
Bones come straight to command
Cause I'm a hard working hand

Whoa, it's not easy
Six in the morning, babe
Dead of winter
Gotta bite the bullet (if you're gonna survive)
Gotta bite the bullet
Gotta bite the bullet (if you're gonna survive)
Gotta bite the bullet (if you're gonna survive)
Gotta bite the bullet (if you're gonna survive)

Hard working hand
Hard working hand
Give a little bit of something
Bones come straight to command
Hard working hand
