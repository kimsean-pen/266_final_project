Took the train back,
Back to where I came from
Took it all alone
It's been so long, I know
Imagine me there, my heart asleep with no air
Begging "Ocean please
Help me drown these memories"

All I need to hear is that
You're not mine

I'm moving East
Somewhere far away from
The sight of my hands
The sight of me not moving
You can't just hop a plane
And come and visit me again
I claim it's in my head
I regret offering

All I need to hear is that
You're not mine
All I wanna hear is that
You're not mine

You take a second,
Take a year
You took me out,
And took me in
And told me all of this
Take a moment, take a year
You help me out, I listen in
You told me all of this and then

All I want to hear is that
You're not mine
All I want to hear is that
You're not mine
All I need to hear is that
You're not mine
All I want to hear is that
You're not mine
