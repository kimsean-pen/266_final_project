You know it ain't right
You treated me wrong
But I thought we could make it
That's why I played nice for far too long
Why you're testing my patience

All along I knew that you were
Holding your feelings back from me
And while I said I'm through with you
That's not how it seems to be

I don't want you back
If you don't wanna give me your heart
I don't want you back
Until I know it's real
But I'm still gonna love forever
And I don't wanna let you back
Until I know

So tell me what's next
And how do you expect
To think you could win back my heart again
You better do it best
Don't wanna have regrets
About giving you another chance

All along I knew that you were
Holding your feelings back from me
And while I said I'm through with you
That's not how it seems to be

I don't want you back
If you don't wanna give me your heart
I don't want you back
Until I know it's real
But I'm still gonna love forever
And I don't wanna let you back
Until I know

And I know I'll be alright
I'll keep my faith in the light
Can't hide to love someone
Now that I know
That's why I've gotta let you know

I don't want you back
If you don't wanna give me your heart
I don't want you back
Until I know it's real
But I'm still gonna love forever
And I don't wanna let you back
Until I know

I don't want you back
(I don't want you back)
If you don't wanna give me your heart
(If you don't wanna give me your heart)
I don't want you back
Until I know it's real
But I'm still gonna love forever
And I don't wanna let you back
Until I know
