Hey goodbye senorita, you sure been a friend of mine
She said well adios amigo
Some other place, some other time
Then we drank a shot of tequila, baby till we meet again
She just said I'll see ya
Wouldn't wanna be ya
There ain't no easy way to say it, but it's time for me to fly
Yeah my truck is packed and runnin', I'm
headed out west tonight
I've stayed longer in Brownsville than I ever
thought I would
I hope I didn't make any promises baby
You were great, and it was good

I made it out to Tucson, where I turned my
truck around
I started barreling down that highway boy, back to that Texas town
The highway sign said Brownsville 116 miles
I guess there's a first time for everything, yeah I think I'm gonna stay a while
Well hello senorita, I've sure missed a friend of mine
She said well welcome back amigo, man you sure took your sweet time
Then we drank a shot of tequila, she said baby till you leave again
It's so good to see ya
Wouldn't wanna be ya
It sure is good to see ya
Wouldn't wanna be ya
