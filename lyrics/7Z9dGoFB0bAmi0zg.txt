Show me what the girl does to the boy
If you can get around to it
Show me what to do, you most enjoy
If you can get around to it
Learning more about you
I hope it's never ever finished
What it's like when I am your new toy
I get excited, you get excited
Why should you fight it
I get excited, I get excited
You get excited, I get excited
You get excited
Show me what the girl does to the boy
If you can get around to it
Show me what to do you most enjoy
If you can get around to it
Learning more about you
I hope it's never ever finished
And what it's like when I am your new toy
If you can get around to it
I get excited, you get excited
You get excited, I get excited
Sex with you being right next to you
Will do it
Being right next to you
The two of us won't do it
Being right next to you
The two of us won't do it
Being so kind to me
Show me what to do you most enjoy
If you can get around to it
Learning more about you
I hope it's never ever finished
And what it's like when I am your new toy
If you can get around to it
