Like an ancient story
Full of death and glory
Remember who we are

With our eyes wide open
And the doors all closen
Surrender to your heart
Remember who we are

Running down the halls
We're writing on the walls
We never letting go

Let my eyes be the rhythm
Let my mind be your freedom
You can take it all, you can take it all
Let my heart be your shelter

Let these bones be the giver
Let this soul be your whisper
You can take it all, you can take it all
Let my heart be your shelter

In a house on fire
Now we're climbing higher
Escaping in the dark
Remember who we are
And the roof is caving
But I'll hide you safely
I'll hold you in my arms
Remember who we are

Running down the halls
We're writing on the walls
We never letting go

Let my eyes be the rhythm
Let my mind be your freedom
You can take it all, you can take it all
Let my heart be your shelter

Let these bones be the giver
Let this soul be your whisper
You can take it all, you can take it all
Let my heart be your shelter

Running down the halls
Riding on the walls
We'll never letting go

Let my eyes be the rhythm
Let my mind be your freedom
You can take it all, you can take it all
Let my heart be your shelter

Let these bones be the giver
Let this soul be your whisper
You can take it all, you can take it all
Let my heart be your shelter

Let my eyes be the rhythm
Let my mind be your freedom
Let my heart be your shelter

Let these bones be the giver
Let this soul be your whisper
Let my heart be your shelter
