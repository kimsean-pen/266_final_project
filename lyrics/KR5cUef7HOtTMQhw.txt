When the daylight comes
Do you feel it?
Leave your bag of bones
Underneath your bed
Everything is as
It should be
I'm leaving now
As I should be

No way, no way
No, we're never gonna talk about it
No way, no way
No, we're never gonna speak again
No way, no way
No, we're never gonna talk about it
No way, no way

When the night descends
I sleep in
All the things you've done
Come to hold me
All that we can do
Is smile
It would be like this
For a while

No way, no way
No, we're never gonna talk about it
No way, no way
No, we're never gonna speak again
No way, no way
No, we're never gonna talk about it
No way, no way

I'm not sad, really
All this means, losing
Letting go, oo-oo
Don't look out, oo-oo
No way, no way, no way
