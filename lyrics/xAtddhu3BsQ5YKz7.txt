Does it feel like
Does it feel like I'm unstable
Does it seem like
Does it seem like I am capable

Anybody else will tell you what you know
But it's anybody's guess if you can let it go
And it feels like
We shake, we break, we crumble

And you can't stop thinking how it drives you mad
Crazy as it is, you never hurt like that
So don't cry, don't cry
Won't be the last time

When you can't feel nothin' and it's not so bad
Maybe all you needed was a better man
So don't cry, don't cry
Won't be the last time

Does it feel right
Does it feel like something's missing
I can see the lies
I can feel it even when we're kissing

Tell me what it is and what I put you through
Cause if anybody touches you, I feel it too
Doesn't feel right
I had a feeling we'd shake, we'd break, we'd crumble

And you can't stop thinking how it drives you mad
Crazy as it is, you never hurt like that
So don't cry, don't cry
Won't be the last time

When you can't feel nothin' and it's not so bad
Maybe all you needed was a better man
So don't cry, don't cry
Won't be the last time

Break me, hate me
I just wanted your
Broken, hopin'
I just wanted your
Not the only
I just wanted your love
Wanted your love

Break me, hate me
I just wanted your
Broken, hopin'
I just wanted your
Not the only
I just wanted your love
Wanted your love

And you can't stop thinking how it drives you mad
Crazy as it is, you never hurt like that
So don't cry, don't cry
Won't be the last time

When you can't feel nothin' and it's not so bad
Maybe all you needed was a better man
So don't cry, don't cry
Won't be the last time
