Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion

I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

So baby, talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do

Here comes the rain again
Raining in my hand like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion

I want to breathe in the open wind
I want to kiss like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

So baby, talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do

So baby, talk to me
Like lovers do

So baby, talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do

Here it comes again
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey.

Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
(Here it comes again)
(Here it comes again)

I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
It is raining with you
(Ooh, here it comes again)

Here comes the rain again
(I said)
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like at new emotion
(Ooh yeah)
(Ooh yeah)

I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?
