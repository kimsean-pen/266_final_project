It's hard to be a human being
How can we?
When we're not quite sure what being human means
Should I let it die?
Or push those thoughts aside?
They never mattered anyway

It's like driving a runaway hearse
I can't stop, I just make things worse
Come on and take the wheel from me
Put me outta my misery
You were crying when I sang the words
I won't see you in hell If I get there first
I'm tearing at the seams
If anyone can dream, then I can

Are we alive?
When the fear subsides
Does it even matter anyway?

It's like driving a runaway hearse
I can't stop, I just make things worse
Come on and take the wheel from me
Put me outta my misery
You were crying when I sang the words
I won't see you in hell If I get there first
I'm tearing at the seams
If anyone can dream, then I can

It's been a long ride
Feels like such a long time
May as well just shut my eyes
I've been asleep for half my life
But I'm awake now
I make mistakes and I make em loud
I make 'em big so they shake the ground
And now I'm making up for it

It's like driving a runaway hearse
I can't stop, I just make things worse
Come on and take the wheel from me
Put me outta my misery
You were crying when I sang the words
I won't see you in hell If I get there first
I'm tearing at the seams
If anyone can dream, then I can
