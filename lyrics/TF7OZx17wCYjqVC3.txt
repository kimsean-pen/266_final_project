Pick me back up just to throw me back down
Apologies too late when you're up against the wall
Compassion heals while duplicity kills
You say that I'm different, you say that I'm different
The only thing different is the way I feel about you

You moved up the ladder at very rapid speed
We moved methodically and calmly
When you got to the top you see enemies
You say that I'm different, you say that I'm different
The only thing different is the way I feel about you

If I knew back then what I know now
That it would all turn out like this
I'd sit back and I'd watch you squirm
'Cause you say I'm different, you say I'm different man
The only thing different is the way I feel about you
