Ho, ho, ho
Shake up the happiness
Wake up the happiness
Shake up the happiness

It's Christmas time
There's a story that I was told
and I wanna tell the world
before I get too old
and don't remember it
so let's December it

and reassemble it (oh yeah)
Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness

And be on Santa's magic list
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all

It's Christmas time
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all

It's Christmas time

Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
It's Christmas time
At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say
I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness?
With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Get my grandma a reason to smile
Tis the season to smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
Let me meet a girl one day that

Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can open some happiness with me
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up

Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up

Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been
I'm gonna show them

So they will know then
Than love will grow in
Than to live again
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up

Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up

Wake up the happiness

Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
It's Christmas time
Ho, ho, ho
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Ho, ho, ho
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
It's Christmas time
