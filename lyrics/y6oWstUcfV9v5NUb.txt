Yeah-eh, this got me so tired
Just cut me loose, or wait in the fire
Yeah-eh, we thank you for trying
That's what you get for breeding a liar

I will take you on, you will take me down
Now I'm gonna get it together

I will take you on, you will take me down
Now I'm gonna get it together

Yeah-eh, just keep on talking
Still see your lips, but I'm already walking
Yeah-eh, I'm getting out of the fire
That's what you get for breeding a liar

I will take you on, you will take me down
Now I'm gonna get it together

I will take you on, you will take me down
Now I'm gonna get it together

Get it together
Get it together

I will take you on, you will take me down
Now I'm gonna get it together
