to be crushed is not to be hit and then left to recover. it's to be left untouched, unable to pass from one place to another.
to be crushed is not to be held down by some minor influence. it's to be left alone with nothing to understand.
to be drowning is not to be suffered as some cruel fate. it should be taken as a blessing, maybe even a gift from god.
but i've never seen him give anything away and i've never known him to have anything to say. which is why i've never felt any real need to pray.
