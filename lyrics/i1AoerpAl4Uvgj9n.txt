It's a call
I fell into your arms that night
Don't ask
It's the time we had apart to sort things out
Just don't ask
It's the work you saying you're doing
But baby, I don't even ask
It's the love that came undone between us
and nobody ever asks
There's a place and time for everything I know
Don't ask
But when I'm around you still I lose control
Just don't ask
You suggest the struggle goes both ways
but baby, I don't even ask
I just wish you had a little faith
but I'm learning not to ask
