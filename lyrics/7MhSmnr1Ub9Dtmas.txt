Pure as the unborn son, pure as the maid should be
Ceased to breathe again
Never look away
From those with nothing to spare

But I do and I don't want to care anymore
If I close my eyes would it spare me the sight?
Of decay, corruption, how we nurture destruction
And everything that will doom us all

Chaos may be thy name, you left us for anything
Trust never been so misplaced
As in your arms that day those that you gave away
To those who could ease your mind
We were nothing but a waste of your time and space

But I do and I don't want to care anymore
If I close my eyes would it spare me the sight?
Of decay, corruption, how we nurture destruction
And everything that will doom us all

But I do and I don't want to care anymore
If I close my eyes would it spare me the sight?
Of decay, corruption, how we nurture destruction
And everything that will doom us all
