Don't focus on the light from the moon
Hold a candle to the trash in my room
You wrote a note that I can't understand
See, my fingers weren't a part of my hand
And the veil loosely covering your face
It fell down to the grass
Now you see everything
...
And you don't wanna see me when you're not feeling good
So I try to rearrange and find the truth in your words
You wrote a note that I can't understand
See, my fingers weren't a part of my hand
And the veil loosely covering your face
It fell down to the grass
Now you see everything
...
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
...
I can't remember if I'm right or I'm wrong
When I try to gauge the distance
You've been gone for so long
Speaking words I chose not to hear
See, my head wasn't attatched to my ears
Picked up the veil from grass
Hold it close to my eyes
I see nothing but black

Don't focus on the light from the moon
Hold a candle to the trash in my room
You wrote a note that I can't understand
See, my fingers weren't a part of my hand
And the veil loosely covering your face
It fell down to the grass
Now you see everything...
Now you seeeee everything.
End
