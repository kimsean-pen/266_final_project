Darkness falls upon my mind
Recalls all the sleepless nights
Shadows of my faceless pain
Feelings of the deep dark rain

Will my sad memories wash away
With my shame?
Will the rain wash away the demons in my eyes?

Dreams of solitude that can't be found
Will the rain wash away?

All I remember was the pain coming back
The rope choke my neck
nightfall all around

All I remember was the pain coming back
The rope choke my neck
nightfall all around

Darkness falls upon my mind
Recalls all the sleepless nights
Shadows of my faceless pain
Feelings of the deep dark rain

Will my sad memories wash away
With my shame?
Will the rain wash away the demons in my mind?
