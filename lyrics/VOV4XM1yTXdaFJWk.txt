Are you back in my life to stay
Or is it just for today, oh that you're gonna need me?
If it's a thrill you're looking for
Honey, I'm flexible, oh yeah

Just be for real, won't you, baby?
Be for real oh baby
You see I, I don't want
To be hurt by love again

So you see I'm not naive
I just would like to believe ah what you tell me
So don't give me the world today
And tomorrow take it away, don't do that to me, darling

Just be for real, won't you, baby?
Be for real, won't you, baby?
You see I, I don't want
To be hurt by love again

Been hurt so many times
You see I, I don't want
To be hurt by love again

I don't give a damn about the truth, baby
Except for the naked truth, oh yeah

Just be for real, won't you, baby?
Be for real, won't you, baby?
You see I, I don't want
To be hurt by love again
No, no, no, no
It's just that I, I don't want
To be hurt by love again
Thanks for the song Mr. Knight
