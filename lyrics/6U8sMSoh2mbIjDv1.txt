Too many cuts
And too many broken bones
Draining the life
Burying skeletons
Do or die
This is the feeling I'm craving
Waiting for life to ignite
This is the moment for taking
A leap of faith

I'll jump into the fire, now free
I'll take you the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in

The ring of the bells
Feeling you resonate
Into the night
Hearing you fade away
Do or die
This is a choice that I'm making
And it feels like I'm living a lie
This is the moment for taking
A leap of faith, I'll

Jump into the fire, now free
I'll take you the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in
Nothing's gonna kill me, come take me
Closer to the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in

So fill your lungs
Inhale the future
That's screaming out

So fill your lungs
Inhale the future
That's screaming out
Release the pressure!

So fill your lungs
Inhale the future
That's screaming out
Release the pressure!

So fill your lungs
Inhale the future
That's screaming out

Jump into the fire, now free
I'll take you the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!
Nothing's gonna kill me, come take me
Closer to the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!

(Jump into the fire)
(Jump into the fire)
I'm not caving in!

Too many cuts
And too many broken bones
