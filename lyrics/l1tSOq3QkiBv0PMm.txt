If I should die this very moment, I wouldn't fear
For I've never known completeness like being here
Wrapped in the warmth of you, loving every breath of you
Still my heart this moment, oh it might burst

Could we stay right here till the end of time
Until the earth stops turning
Wanna love you until the seas run dry
I've found the one I've waited for

All this time I've loved you and never known your face
All this time I've missed you and searched this human race
Here is true peace here my heart knows calm
Safe in your soul bathed in your sighs

Wanna stay right here till the end of time
Till the earth stops turning
Gonna love you until the seas run dry
I've found the one I've waited for, the one I've waited for

All I've known, all I've done
All I've felt was leading to this
All I've known, all I've done
All I've felt was leading to this

Wanna stay right here
Till the end of time till the earth stops turning
Gonna love you till the seas run dry
I've found the one I've waited for, the one I've waited for

Wanna stay right here
Till the end of time, till the earth stops turning
Gonna love you till the seas run dry
I've found the one I've been waited for, the one I've waited for

The one I've waited for
