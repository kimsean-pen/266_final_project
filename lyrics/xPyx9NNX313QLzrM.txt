I wonder
What it's like
To attack at night
Mow down the defenseless

Invasions and raids just called
Fucking, punitive expeditions
Like a wildfire
Devastation spreads
Across all Gallia

From Helvetia to Eburonia
The ravener's insatiate
(Havoc)
Just think of yesterday
(Ruin)

A mass illusion
How could it come this far?
Narbonensis was not enough
The empire needed more
From Aremorica to Carnutia
Plagued and war-ridden land
War's inflicted on free Gallia
An organised downfall

A black cloud of imperial
Rapacity unleashed

(Whoaaaaa)
(Galia Est Pactata)
Just think of yesterday
(Ruin)

Our dormant minds
Were not prepared for this
Imperial needs are met
At the bloody cost of free tribes
Invasion raid and war atrocity
In the name of S.P.Q.R.
(Havoc)
Just think of yesterday
(Ruin)
A mass illusion
How could it come this far?
