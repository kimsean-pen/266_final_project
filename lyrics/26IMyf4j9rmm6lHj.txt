Insecure in her skin
Like a puppet, a girl on a string
Broke away
Learned to fly
If you want her back, gotta let her shine

So it looks like the joke's on you
'Cause, the girl that you thought you knew

She's so gone (she's so gone)
That's so over now
She's so gone (she's so gone)
You won't find her around
You can look but you won't see
The girl I used to be
'Cause she, she's so gone
(She's so gone, yeah)

Here I am, this is me
And I'm stronger than you ever thought I'd be
Are you shocked?
Are you mad?
That you're missing out on who I really am

Now it looks like the joke's on you
'Cause, the girl that you thought you knew

She's so gone (she's so gone)
That's so over now
She's so gone (she's so gone)
You won't find her around
You can look but you won't see
The girl I used to be
'Cause she

She's so gone away like history
She's so gone
Baby, this is me, yeah

She's so gone (she's so gone)
That's so over now
She's so gone (she's so gone)
You won't find her around
You can look but you won't see
The girl I used to be
'Cause she, she's so gone (she's so gone)

She's so gone (she's so gone)
You can look but you won't see
The girl I used to be
'Cause she, she's so gone

(So long)
(She's so gone)
(She's so gone)
Gone, gone, gone
