This is the road I chose
This is the life I've made
Say what you want but know this world opened her arms for me

I write these words in blood
I write these words for you
This world deserves to finally know the...

Your arrogance blinds you
Why don't you open your mind
And listen to the words
That could save your life

We all grow tired of
What we think we know
But at the end of the day
We have to choose where our paths go

Decide at the fork in the road
Decide at the fork in the road

Just so you know we'll never go under
Please tell me, please tell me
Please try and tell me I'm wrong

You say we follow along
Well now follow along
To these words I say
They're all I have.
To open the door that could never be cracked.

Please try to tell me I'm wrong
And say I'll never belong
Because all your hate
Won't wear me down
I'll still be the last one left wearing the crown

You think we're hopeless and lost
You think we're just fucking pawns
But we will never be
No we will never be

I lie awake and dream of how we will change the world, change the world!
It's up to us to fill in the cracks
And bring this world back to what it could have been

It's up to us, it's up to us

You say we follow along
Well now follow along
To these words I say
They're all I have.
To open the door that could never be cracked.

Please try to tell me I'm wrong
And say I'll never belong
Because all your hate
Won't wear me down
I'll still be the last one left wearing the crown
You'll never find happiness while you live inside hate.
Yeah!
I write these words in blood
I write these words for you
This world deserves to finally know the truth
This is the road I chose
This is the life I've made
Say what you want but know this world opened her arms for me
