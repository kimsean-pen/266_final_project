Could it be that one small voice doesn't count in the room
Yellow like a geisha gown, denying all the way
Could this by three be ten, honor marches on
Yellow like a geisha gown, denial all the way

Shaking through, opportune
Shaking through, opportune

Are we grown way too far, taking after rain
Yellow like a geisha gown, denying all the way

Shaking through, opportune
Shaking through, opportune
In my life

Ears that are still, children of today on parade
Yellow like a geisha gown, denying all the way

Shaking through, opportune
Shaking through, opportune

Shaking through, opportune
Shaking through, opportune
