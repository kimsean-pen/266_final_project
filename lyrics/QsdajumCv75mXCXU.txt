Beautiful
You are stronger than you know
Oh, you're something beautiful!

Know you're hurting and you feel like all is lost
Heart is burning from the love that's been cut off
But day lights come in and time for you is all I got
And I promise you'll get through this
You can do this

'Cause all that you need
Is a little room to breathe

Breathe in and let it go, oh
Your tears are not for nothing
Let them fall off
In every teardrop there is something beautiful, oh
You are stronger than you know, oh
Oh you're something beautiful!

Fighting shadows, in a game that you can't win
Losing battles and no wonder your skin
Is just a blessing in disguise
Without darkness, there is no light
Just hold on a little longer
And I promise you'll get through this

Because all that you need
Is a little room to breathe

Breathe in and let it go, oh
Your tears are not for nothing
Let them fall off
In every teardrop there is something beautiful, oh
You are stronger than you know, oh
Oh you're something beautiful

Can't feel the love without the pain
The sun wouldn't matter without the rain
You're not required to carry the weight
So let it go, here's my hand to hold
At the end of it all, there's a smile for you waiting
(So...)

Breathe in and let it go, oh
Your tears are not for nothing
Let them fall off
In every teardrop there is something beautiful, oh
You are stronger than you know, oh
Oh you're something beautiful

Let it go, let it go! (You're something beautiful)
(You're something beautiful)
(You're something beautiful)
(You're something beautiful)
Beautiful, oh (You're something beautiful)
You are stronger than you know, oh (You're something beautiful)
You're something beautiful
(You're something beautiful)
(You're something beautiful)
You're something beautiful baby (You're something beautiful)
And you better believe that (You're something beautiful)

Don't let them tell you you're not (You're something beautiful)
Just give it all that you got (You're something beautiful)
'Cause you are more than enough (You deserve it all)
And you deserve it all (You're something beautiful)
Don't let them tell you you're not (You're something beautiful)

Just give it all that you got (You're something beautiful)
'Cause you are more than enough (You're something beautiful)
You're something beautiful (You're something beautiful)
Don't let them tell you you're not (You're something beautiful)
Just give it all that you got (You're something beautiful)
'Cause you are more than enough (You're something beautiful)
And you deserve it all (You're something beautiful)

Don't let them tell you you're not (You're something beautiful)
Just give it all that you got (You're something beautiful)
'Cause you are more than enough (You're something beautiful)
You're something beautiful (You're something beautiful)

Don't let them tell you you're not
Just give it all that you got
'Cause you are more than enough
And you deserve it all

Don't let them tell you you're not
Just give it all that you got
'Cause you are more than enough
You're something beautiful
