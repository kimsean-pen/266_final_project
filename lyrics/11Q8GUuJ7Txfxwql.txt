If it feels like you need more
I can leave if you said enough

Hole in the house
Where we eat and do the rest
Hearts in the pipes
You say that I'm unfair
How else could I have treated you like that?
Family stopped six feet, we turned and ran

If it feels like you need more, honey
Take a walk outside in the yard
There's patches in our dreams now
I haven't got used to the look
There's nothing left to read but catalogues
Nothing left to see here

I'll make a list
I'll count in each instance
Our only house has been, since I left
At night I like to smoke in secret
We can be discrete in my basement

If it feels like you need more
If it feels like you need more

If it feels like you need more, honey
Take a walk outside in the yard
There's patches in our dreams now
I haven't got used to the look
There's nothing left to read but catalogues
Nothing left to see here

If it feels like you need more, honey
Take a walk outside in the yard
There's patches in our dreams now
I haven't got used to the look
There's nothing left to read but catalogues
Nothing left to see here
