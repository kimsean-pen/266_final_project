you're talking too loud
won't you walk over, whisper, motion hands, or bat a lash
you gotta see
there's too many eyes

you're walking too fast
why the hurry, let me pace myself, no need to run a lap
you gotta lead
you gotta lead

you got to lose, you got to lose, you got to lose sometime
you got to lose, you got to lose, you got to lose sometime

hear what i say
when you waltz over, whistle, and you try to have your way
you gotta see
you fail --- (?)

you're coming today
with a hop in your step, you kinda marvel at yourself
you gotta breathe
you gotta breathe

you got to lose, you got to lose, you got to lose sometime
you got to lose, you got to lose, you got to lose sometime

cowardice
you felt it yourself
you're telling lies
you said too much

you got nothing to lose, nothing to lose, nothing to lose this time
you got nothing to lose, nothing to lose, nothing to lose this time
you got nothing to lose, nothing to lose, nothing to lose
