She's shaking down
I'm absent and numb from shock
Reachin' around for the
Hands of the clock

Should've lied

Lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up

Cupid's trick comes
Down to shake and deal
A stupid kick that
Makes me reel

Should've lied

Lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up

She's shaking down
It's never over and done
So kick me, cane me
And I'll know

Why

Lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up, it's my lie
Should've lit me up
