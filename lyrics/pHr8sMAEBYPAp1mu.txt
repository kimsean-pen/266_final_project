autumn is here
i can smell the leaves
little by little it gets colder

take the bus downtown
ride a bike
to the park
with your trip

people everywhere
immediate processors
writing books and climbing stairs

just a few hours
the sun goes down
all the people hanging around go back home
or stay downtown

autumn is here
i can smell the leaves
the color of fire
i look at the trees grow older
