The first fist of fury is thunder
You chop em down with the sight of your glass
Take a turn its a night for bleivers (oohoohoh oohoohoh)
Your just a breath away and your ready to blast

In to the shadows again
In to the shadow again ain ain

No one said it would feel this good (oooohohohohh)
With the warmth of smoke on your lungs
And the taste of blood on your tounge
No one said it would feel this good
oooohohohohh
Give it away ay ay
dont give it away ay ay

You turn it on for belivers (for belivers, for belivers)
You turn it on for the fame (the fame the fame)
Trigger happy 8mm's
Calling out your name (calling out, calling out, out)

In to the shadow again
In to the shadow again ain ain

No one said it would feel this good
oooohohohohh
With the warmth of smoke on your lungs
And the taste of blood on your tounge
No one said it would feel this good (oooohohohohh)
Give it away ay ay
dont give it away ay ay

Cut it off when i stop breathing in twenty twenty knuckles gripped
Just when you thought it was cold
Still calling out your name
Just when you thought it was cold
Still calling out your name
Whos Calling out my name

No one said it would feel this good
oooohohohohh
With the warmth smoke on your lungs
And the taste of blood on your tounge
No one said it would feel this good (oooohohohohh)
Give it away ay ay
dont give it away ay ay
