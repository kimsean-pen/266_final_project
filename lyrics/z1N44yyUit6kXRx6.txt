If I had a perfect day
I would have it start this way
Open up the fridge and have a tall boy
Yeah

Then I'd meet up with my friends
Head out to the game again
We don't even really care who wins
(Hey)

Wins
(Hey)
One, two, three
Now excitement seems to grow, when we're hangin' with the bro's
When we're chillin' and we pound a case of Stroh's
Now the game is cool to see, you can high five on TV
Count the riot on the
One, two, three
Operation is in sight and the field is open wide
When you break it then you know you're still alive
If the cops don't you make you pay, and you make your getaway
Then you know that's one fine day
Hey
On the day before we're through

We could torch a car or two
Then have ourselves another tall boy
Yeah
Water hoses and batons

That's the real game that's on
I don't really give a shit who wins
(Hey)
Wins

(Hey)
One, two, three
Now excitement seems to grow, when we're hangin' with the bro's
When we're chillin' and we pound a case of Stroh's
Now the game is cool to see, you can high five on TV
Count the riot on the
One, two, three
Operation is in sight and the field is open wide
When you break it then you know you're still alive
If the cops don't make you pay, and you make your getaway
Then you know that's one fine day
Hey
I believe it's my God given right
To destroy everything in my sight

'Cause it never gets dull, it never gets old
(Woho)
The only it gets is more bold
(Woho, ho)
Drinkin', fightin', goin' to the game
(Woho, ho, ho)
In our world it's a way to stay sane
(Woho)
If you're askin' me, to have it my way

(Woho, ho)
I'd say that's one fine day
(Woho, ho, ho)
Now excitement seems to grow, when we're hangin' with the bro's
When we're chillin' and we pound a case of Stroh's

Operation is in sight and the field is open wide
When you break it then you know you're still alive
If the cops don't you make you pay, and you make your getaway
Then you know that's one fine day, hey
Then you know that's one fine day
Now
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
