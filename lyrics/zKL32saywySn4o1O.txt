If you want the sun, Im am hotter than love
Tell me where, tell me when, Im a lover
I bought a lockpick, so I could hide all of my secrets away
Hide my secrets from you
You can come but you cannot stay
You can go, go, away, ey, ey
You can go, go, away, ey, ey
If you want the sun, Im am hotter than love
Tell me where, tell me when, Im a lover

Hide my secrets from you
You can come but you cannot stay
You can go, go, away, ey, ey
You can go, go, away, ey, ey
I bought a lockpick, so I could hide all of my secrets away
Hide my secrets from you
You can come but you cannot stay
After the sun, theres the light
You can go, go, away, ey, ey
You can go, go, away, ey, ey x 2
