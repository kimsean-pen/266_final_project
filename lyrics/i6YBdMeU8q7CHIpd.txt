I feel so lonesome, I could cry
But instead of that time
Sitting lonely with somebody, lonely dude
Well, there's nothing in the world I'd rather do
Now tell me if you don't feel these words
But all I want, all I ever need
Is someone out there to believe
Sometimes believe
Not always believe
Sometimes believe.

Now we don't have to take it to extreme
Will keep our hands on lay keep it all lift apart
But I'm giving you my heart, my heart
Are you giving me your heart?
Your heart
Are you lonely too?
Are you lonely too?

Hi-five, so am I
All of your life
Stuck in time
I'm so .
I'm stuck with you, I do, I do
Of you, of you.
