Turning to the blackness
to the blackness
Waiting for the bad news
for the bad news
Gave myself to madness
to the madness
Craving for the bad news
for the bad news

Turning to the blackness
Waiting for the bad news
Gave myself to madness
Craving for the bad news

How far, if you do?
How far?
Show me how to hold you
Show me how to hold you

Take me where you're going
Don't you let me waste you
Holding to the deep end
I'll let go if you do

Whole blood running through me
Floating wild and I'm free
Take you where I'm going
I wont let you waste me

How far, if you do?
how far?
I'll follow the madness behind you
I'll follow the mad

Show me how to hold you
Show me how to hold you
Take me where I want to
Take me where I want to

Turning to the blackness
Waiting for the bad news
for the bad news
