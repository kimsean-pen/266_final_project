Why must we wait until tonight?
Tell me why
Why must we wait until tonight?
You wanna take a little time
Wanna drink me like a fine wine
Like the book of love
Line by line
But I wanna play with you
Right now
Go all the way with you, Baby
And show you how
'Cause my body just can't say no
And fingers just won't let go
Tell me why
Why must we wait until tonight?
Tell me why
Why when I've waited all my life
You're touching me
I'm touching you
What should I do now
Tell me why
Why must we wait until tonight?
Like to take it real slow
Show me every little move you know
Take a little love and watch it grow
But I wanna lay with you, Darlin'
Right now
Make love all day with you, Baby
And show you how
Take my body
Don't take my time
Take your lips and make them mine
Tell me why
Why must we wait until tonight?
Tell me why
Why, when I've waited all my life
You're touching me
I'm touching you
What should I do now
Tell me why
Why must we wait until tonight?
Come on, come on, come on, come on...
'Cause my body just can't say no
And fingers just won't let go
Baby,
Tell me why
Why must we wait until tonight?
Tell me Baby
Tell me why
Why, when I've waited all my life
Come on
Tell me why
Why must we wait...
