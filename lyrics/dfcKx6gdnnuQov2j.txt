You sawed it off
And called my bluff
You said "it's true
But not enough"
Belief involves
A change of scene
It all comes true
Eventually
Though patience is key

So how can this wait?
It's not enough for us
How can this wait?
It's not enough for us
We'll all believe eventually
So how can this wait?
It's not enough for us

You sent this through
Forget me not
Impressive truths
Electric shocks
If we can wait
For ways to see
Through all the proofs
And chemistry
Then patience is key

But how can this wait?
It's not enough for us
How can this wait?
It's not enough for us
We'll all believe eventually
So how can this wait?
It's not enough for us

I can go and overthink this
If you want to
Nothing much is gonna change
If it's not forced through
I can go and overthink this
If you want to
Probably will

But how can this wait?
It's not enough for us
How can this wait?
It's not enough for us
We'll all believe eventually
So how can this wait?
It's not enough for us
It's not enough for us
How can this wait?
It's not enough for us
