This empire of silence sways in the wind
Leaves for the winter won't you shelter me
Look in the mirror, tell me what you see
A cause for the cancer or a remedy?

Every rung beneath my feet
The weight will bare on shoulders build to lean
The strength inside a seed, we're all alone
If I learn from our deceits
Let the water guide us to the sea
For all our wounds to heal
We're all alone

We're building walls
Where there should have been bridges
Borders in the land that we roam
We pray for war like it's a fucking religion
When greed is all we know

Conditioned innocent with loves intention
Confused together, realize we're all the same

This empire of silence sways in the wind
Leaves for the winter won't you shelter me
Look in the mirror, tell me what you see
A cause for the cancer or a remedy?
Pull out the knife that you've earned
This world's a loss to an age of a self loving race
With no desire to change
Emergency positions please, reprieve humanity

We're building walls
Where there should have been bridges
Borders in the land that we roam
We pray for war like it's a fucking religion
When greed is all we know
We won't give up on the truth
We won't give in to their rules
We're not afraid of a world corrupted
We won't give up on you
