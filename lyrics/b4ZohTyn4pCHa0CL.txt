I know
That it's taken me all this time to say girl
I'm slow
So it's taken me all this time to say girl
Tip toe
And I want to acknowledge my mistake girl
Uh Oh
And I hope that you know it's not too late
Put it in my pocket, put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket, in my pocket
In my back pocket
O O O
And I'll
Put it in my pocket, put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket, in my pocket
In my back pocket
And I'll read when I'm alone
Do you like me circle yes or no
On this piece of paper
'Cause I really really need to know
Are you gonna be my 5th grade queen
Hand it back after the second hour
Then I'll know if you're gonna be my special flower
Ooo girl 'cause I need to know
I will
Put it in my pocket, put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket, in my pocket
In my back pocket
O O O
And I'll
Put it in my pocket, put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket, in my pocket
In my back pocket
And I'll read it when I'm alone
When you kissed me on the playground
I lost my breath I had to lay down
And assess what I had seen
Then I had to write the words out
'Cause you took 'em out of my mouth
But it's hard for me to read
Out loud
Oh gee
Oh gosh
I know
That it's taken me all this time to say girl
I'm slow
So it's taken me all this time to say girl
Tip toe
And I want to acknowledge my mistake girl
Uh Oh
And I hope that you know it's not too late girl
I know
That it's taken me all this time to say girl
I'm slow
So it's taken me all this time to say girl
Tip toe
And I want to acknowledge my mistake girl
Uh Oh
And I hope that you know it's not too late
