Jack and Jill went up the hill, a bucket full of dreams
When the morning came, they carved their names into the cherry tree
But the hill was built on quicksand and it all came tumblin' down
So they held onto the only thing they couldn't live without

And here you are the best of us
With a bigger heart than the rest of us

I'm so sorry
I couldn't give you the perfect story
A textbook happy ending
Where nobody here gets hurt
But don't you worry
Your daddy and your mommy
May be a little broken
But not our love for you
Oh our love for you
Can move the earth
Ooh ooh ooh

When London bridge came falling down, I saw you through the flames
And for a second I convinced myself, it's better if I stay
But what would you thought of love? If you've been watched us burn
Would you grow up and think, a bridge on fire is what you deserve

And here you are the best of us
With a bigger heart than the rest of us

I'm so sorry
I couldn't give you the perfect story
A textbook happy ending
Where nobody here gets hurt
But don't you worry
Your daddy and your mommy
May be a little broken
But not our love for you
Oh our love for you
Can move the earth
Oh the earth

And I never had to wonder
I don't regret what we've been through
Don't have to look no further
The answer's here it's you
