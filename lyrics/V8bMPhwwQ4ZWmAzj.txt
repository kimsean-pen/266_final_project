Don't know history,
Except for your own, your own
That lipstick on your teeth
Don't bother you none, no none

'Cause there's something 'bout how raw you are
It's kinda beautiful and makes you feel alive, alive
It's so magical, the way you walk
Yeah the way you talk, you got me hypnotized

I-I-I-I-I-, I like you unsweet
Don't need no manners
Don't need the good, the good grammar
When you pour your heart out on me
Heart out on me, when you pour your heart out on me
I want you unsweet
You satisfy me
That brutal honesty
Yeah, won't you pour your heart out on me
Heart out on me, when you pour your heart out on me

I'm not your enemy, I ain't changin' you, none
Those girls are stickly sweet
Leave a burn on my tongue, oh yeah

'Cause there's something 'bout how raw you are
It's kinda beautiful and makes you feel alive, alive
It's so magical, the way you walk
Yeah the way you talk, you got me hypnotized

I-I-I-I-I, I like you unsweet
Don't need no manners
Don't need the good, the good grammar
When you pour your heart out on me
Heart out on me, when you pour your heart out on me
I want you unsweet
You satisfy me
That brutal honesty
Yeah, won't you pour your heart out on me
Heart out on me, when you pour your heart out on me

When you pour it up,
I don't need a cup
Don't you clean it up,
I don't mind getting messy with your love
When you pour it up
I don't need a cup
Don't you clean it up,
I don't mind getting messy with your, messy with your love

I like you unsweet
(I like you unsweet)
Don't need no manners
(Don't need no manners)
Don't need the good, the good grammar
When you pour your heart out on me
Heart out on me, when you pour your heart out on me
I want you unsweet
You satisfy me
That brutal honesty
Yeah, won't you pour your heart out on me
Heart out on me, when you pour your heart out on me
