If you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance,
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me baby
If you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance,
If you can't dance to this you can't do nothing for me baby

Now we got the flavour, the bad behaviour,
The rhythm, the melody, the juice for your savour,
Rockin' and vibing somebody is jivin',
You need to take a tip, sort it out, get a grip
Whenever I go out, whenever it may be
There never is a Keanu but the dweeb lookin' at me
But then even if I did score, he's a looser in the dance floor
Take a deep breath count 1 2 3

Even when his eyes met mine
His slamming moves were out of time
Can't you just feel the groove
Why don't you move,
It's easy can't you see (can't you see)
Take my hands and dance with me (dance with me)

If you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance,
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me baby
If you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance,
If you can't dance to this you can't do nothing for me baby

"Hey macho, te ví el otro día, me dio mucha, mucha alegría,
Escucha la música, Ay madre mía!
Hey chico, tu no tienes nada
Que susto, que sueco, que polla, que tieso
Oh, no me toques, ay que pero, feo
Venga, venga, marcha salida, toma esa música
Me cantas deprisa, cuidado, cuidado, hey chico,
Que loco, toma mi ritmo, me voy contigo,
Hey macho te quiero, quiero un hombre, necesito si,
Pero no tú, un hombre, hey macho, hey macho,
Si no bailas esto no puedes nada conmigo"

If you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance,
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me baby
If you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance,
If you can't dance to this you can't do nothing for me baby

You can't do nothing for me baby
Oh ouo ouo ouo
Nothing baby
Oh ouo ouo ouo
The rhythm
You can't do nothing for me baby
(Oh ouo ouo ouo)

Even when his eyes met mine
His slamming shoes were out of time
Can't you just feel the groove
Why don't you move, (Oh ouo ouo ouo)
It's easy can't you see (can't you see)
Take my hands and dance with me (dance with me)

If you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance,
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me baby
If you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance,
If you can't dance to this you can't do nothing for me baby
Can't do nothing for me baby
If you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance,
If you can't dance to this you can't do nothing for me baby
(You can't do nothing for me baby)
If you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance,
If you can't dance to this you can't do nothing for me baby
(You can't do nothing for me baby)
If you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance, if you can't dance,
If you can't dance to this you can't do nothing for me baby
