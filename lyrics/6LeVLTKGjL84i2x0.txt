You ain't gonna change me
Between these hollow walks
I have seen my feet stretched out
Through the rain and fire walks

Lover, release me
I'm dying in the dark with you
Lover, believe me
I tried and tried and tried for you

Maybe it's not you at all
Maybe it's the time of the year
I have seen my heart grow old
It's smaller than I can bear

Lover, release me
I'm dying in the dark with you
Lover, believe me
I tried and tried and tried for you

Close your eyes, close your eyes
Heaven's blind
Can't make the waves of the tides in me to say goodbye

Lover, release me
I'm dying in the dark with you
Lover, believe me
I tried and tried and tried for you
