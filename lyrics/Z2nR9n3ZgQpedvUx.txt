We walked the loneliest mile
We smiled without any style
We kiss altogether wrong
No intention

We lied about each other's drinks
We lived without each other thinking
What anyone would do
Without me and you

It's like I told you
Only the lonely can play

So hold on, here we go
Hold on to nothin' we know
I feel so lonely way up here

We mention the time we were together
So long ago, well I don't remember
All I know is that it makes me feel good now

It's like I told you
Only the lonely can play
Only the lonely can play

Only the lonely can play
It's like I told you
Only the lonely can play
Only the lonely can play
