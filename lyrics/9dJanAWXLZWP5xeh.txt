Hold on, hold on for delight
And run, and run all night
For you, I looked in endless ways
Stay with me, please believe
I can be your memory

My love will never be the same
And my heart is never going to regret
For you, I looked in endless ways
I looked in endless ways

Hold on, hold on for delight
And run and run all night
For you, I looked in endless ways
I looked in endless ways

There's no way of knowing
We can't be waiting
There's no way of knowing
The dream I'm creating
