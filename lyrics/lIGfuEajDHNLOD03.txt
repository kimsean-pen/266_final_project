Try to hold my head up high
But I cannot fake
Babe, I need your lullaby
Not to stay awake

And whenever I lose myself in disbelief
Then I got you on my mind
Some kinda relief

I hold on
'Til the fire in my heart is gone
I hold on, headlong
'Til the fire in my heart is gone
(Shine on)

When I finally fall asleep
You're surrounding me
As you're flooding through my dreams
Every inch of me
Tells me stories of my life and of what could be
Always by my side
Some kinda believe

I hold on
'Til the fire in my heart is gone
I hold on, headlong
'Til the fire in my heart is gone
Let the love shine on

Let the love shine on

Try to hold my head up high
But I cannot fake
Babe, I need your lullaby
Not to stay awake

And whenever I lose myself in disbelief
Then I got you on my mind
Some kinda relief

I hold on
'Til the fire in my heart is gone
I hold on, headlong
'Til the fire in my heart is gone
Let the love shine on

Let the love shine on

I hold on
'Til the fire in my heart is gone
I hold on, headlong
'Til the fire in my heart is gone
Let the love shine on
