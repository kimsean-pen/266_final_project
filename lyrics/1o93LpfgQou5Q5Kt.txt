I want you to levitate me
don't you love me yet?
press up against the amp, turn up the treble
don't forget

getting dizzy sittin around
sacred trickster and the no tech sound

i wish i could be music on a tree
noise nomads and me
levitating on the ground
uh huh uh huh
uh huh uh huh
uh huh uh huh
uh huh uh huh

whats its like to be a girl in a band?
i don't quite understand
that's so quaint to hear
i feel so faint my dear
getting dizzy sittin around
sacred trickster and the no tech sound
i wish i could be music on a tree
noise nomads and me
levitating, scootin around
