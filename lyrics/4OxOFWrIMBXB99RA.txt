How much I love
Love you 'till I get old
The truth that can be told
I love

The truth that can be told
You feel me, real gold?
Real golg shines just for who can see through
So, my sister, so, my lover, so, my friend

Let's have a daughter, let's have a daughter
Far from comprehend
I love you until the end of time
Like "once upon" I dedicate this rhyme to the only one
She's a part of my spirit and soul
Can never be sold impossible be possible

I gotta be able to keep my concentration
My train is in your station dizzy sensation
All over the body and brain
Like I had a good wine, I feel fine, no waitin'in vain

So let's go build a nation
I dedicate this song for you, who make my heart beat strong
Baby girl, you're still my meditation
