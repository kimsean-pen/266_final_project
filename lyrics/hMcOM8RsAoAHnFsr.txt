On the ground I lay
Motionless in pain
I can see my life
Flashing before my eyes
Did I fall asleep
Is this all a dream
Wake me up
I'm living a nightmare
I will not die
(I will not die)
I will survive

I will not die
I'll wait here for you
I feel alive
When you're beside me
I will not die
I'll wait here for you

In my time of dying

On this bed I lay
Losing everything
I can see my life
Passing me by
Was it all too much
Or just not enough
Wake me up
I'm living a nightmare
I will not die

(I will not die)
I will survive

I will not die
I'll wait here for you
I feel alive
When you're beside me

I will not die
I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying

I will not die
I'll wait here for you
I feel alive
When you're beside me
I will not die
I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying
I will not die
I'll wait here for you
I will not die
When you're beside me
I will not die
I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying
