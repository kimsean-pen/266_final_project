Something happenin' here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware

It's time we stop, children
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

It's time we stop, children
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

What a field day for the heat
Thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly sayin', hooray for our side

It's time we stop, children
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
Starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line
The man come and takes you away

It's time we stop, children
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Stop, children
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Stop, children
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
