The little things you do to me
Are taking me over, I wanna show ya
Everything inside of me
Like a nervous heart that is crazy beatin'
my feet are stuck here against the pavement
I wanna break free, I wanna make it
Closer to your eyes, get your attention
Before you pass me by

Back up, back up
Take another chance
Don't you mess up, mess up
I don't wanna lose you
Wake up, wake up
This ain't just a thing that you
Give up, give up
Don't you say that I'd be
Better off, better off, sleeping by myself and wondering
If I'm better off, better off, without you boy.

Don't just leave me hangin' on...
