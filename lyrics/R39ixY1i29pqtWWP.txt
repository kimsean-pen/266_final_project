We may wanna grow old,
But we don't wanna grow up

Yea, it may be a lie
To tell everyone I'm fine
When I get so tired of all my tired plans

So I won't hesitate to make all the big mistakes
'Cause I get so excited when my sky falls down

My smile is a wasteland
My 'sorry's are a wasteland
My body breaks from all the weight on my shoulders
My love is a wasteland
My forgiveness is a wasteland
I felt all the aches a heart could take
I'll be goddamned

I'm so tired of all this quiet

Yet I still hesitate in hopes that I'll save some face
I wanna grow old, but I don't wanna grow up

My smile is a wasteland
My 'sorry's are a wasteland
My body breaks from all the weight on my shoulders
My love is a wasteland
My forgiveness is a wasteland
I felt all the aches a heart could take
I'll be goddamned

(No wonder I wander, and I wonder just who I am)

My smile is a wasteland
My 'sorry's are a wasteland
My body breaks from all the weight on my shoulders
My love is a wasteland
My stomach is a wasteland
I felt all the aches a heart could take
I'll be goddamned
