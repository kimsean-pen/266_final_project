Morning oh dreadful dawn, spread your pale dim light
Reign for your last time over lands once so bright
But your energy shall be weak, and soon to die
So die in pain my dear, expire, goodbye...
Ages has past since your eyes enlightened the earth
from a source of light that gave all godness birth
But your energy is weak and soon to die
The ground is sour from the evil that here lie

I have come to challenge your ways
Light's bane - The Last of your days
Oh broken wings - My darkness enslaves
Allow me to erase your feeble race

Morning, so feeble dawn, spread no pale dim light
You've been breeding for your last time, a source without
might
An epitaph oh lost worthlessness - Still echoes your last
cries
The earth is pure of the evil that here thrives

I have come to challenge your ways
Light's bane - The Last of your days
Oh broken wings - My darkness enslaves
Allow me to erase your feeble race

What marks the death of 'god' is the twilight for a dark age
His creation being plagued with the venomous blood of ours
The sky suffocates eclipsed by a black mist of hatred
Where goodness cannot reach the fire burns in dark flames

I have come to challenge your ways
Light's bane - The Last of your days
Oh broken wings - My darkness enslaves
Will you allow me to erase your feeble race?
