You made it happen like it's automatic
You're pushing out all of the things I'd never show
You make me feel as if my life's so tragic
So many people in your life just letting you know
You make my body go, oh...
A double meaning
A new age feeling
Is that your vibe is that something else you're stealing?
It's not a breakthrough
Whatever you do
Is overrated I'm not intimidated

Cause I can do that
Cause I can do that
Cause I can do that like that only better
Cause I can do that
Cause I can do that
Cause I can do that like that only better
You make them feel like they have got to have it
I sit there craving all the things you're dying to show
Transforming visions with your modern magic
And now I'm screaming out I just had to let you know
You make my body go, oh...
A double meaning
A new age feeling
Is that your vibe is that something else you're stealing?
It's not a breakthrough
Whatever you do
Is overrated I'm not intimidated
Cause I can do that
Cause I can do that
Cause I can do that like that only better
Cause I can do that
Cause I can do that
Cause I can do that like that only better
You make my body go, oh...
