I see the ocean is rising, let the water wash it all away
Live like there's never tomorrow, when there's no escaping yesterday
Do you ever miss that feeling?
Dont pretend like your the one who's lost
I see the ocean is rising and I keep sinking

Deep down it's getting hard to breath now
I'm reaching out to touch you
And I can't feel it all
No I can't feel it all

I watch the waves from underwater, see the ocean push you all the way
Live like there's no today
Do you ever get that feeling your the only one that pays a cost
Well I'm just at fault

Deep down it's getting hard to breath now
I'm reaching out to touch you
But I can't feel it all
Deep down it's getting hard to breath now
I'm reaching out to touch you
And I can't feel it all
No I can't feel it all

Save yourself
if nothing else you should save yourself
If nothing else...
Save yourself
if nothing else you should save yourself
If nothing else...

Let the ocean rise above me
Will the water help me find my way
Wash it away...

Deep down it's getting hard to breath now
I'm reaching out to touch you
And I can't feel it all
Deep down it's getting hard to breath now
I'm reaching out to touch you
And I can't feel it all
No I can't feel it all
