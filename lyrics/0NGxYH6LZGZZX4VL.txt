She's got her toe in the cornhole
Bleeding out in a snocone
Lost my will to the black hole
Stuck my gum on his soul

Smoked the last of the bad pot
Listen in on your last thought
Will to live or a life lost
Bury me in the bad box

Take me on a date
Take me anywhere
Was I insane?
Purple in the face
Laughing all the way home, I thought

Burn me at the stake
Lead me anywhere
Was I insane?
Purple in the face
Laughing all the way home, I thoughtâ€”
