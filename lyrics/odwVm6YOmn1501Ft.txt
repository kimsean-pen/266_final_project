Here's the thing,
didn't know what I was harbouring
(it's called desire),
just enough
to let myself believe that I'm in love
(and walk your way).
That you're the light and I want to see it.
That you're the heat and I want to feel it.

So give something to dream about,
be the reason the lights go out.
Give me something to scream about,
be the reason to open my mouth.
Let the seasons come and go,
be the reason it never gets cold
so when the world falls apart,
your're the reason
there's still hope in my heart.

I yearn for the beginning
when nothing felt like this,
to feel that first explosion,
the first real kiss,
and that fire in the stomach,
the screaming of the heart,
the beat and the rhythm
that tears your dreams apart.
If there's a light then I want to see it.
If there's heat then I want to be it,
that sweat that drips all over your body,
just open up your lips and say you love me.

So give something to dream about,
be the reason the lights go out.
Give me something to scream about,
be the reason to open my mouth.
Let the seasons come and go,
be the reason it never gets cold
so when the world falls apart,
your're the reason
there's still hope in my heart.

There's still hope in my heart
There's still hope in my heart
(In my heart
I feel it
in my heart yeeaaa)
