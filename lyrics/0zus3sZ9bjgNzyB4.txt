Was I too dumb to notice
Pale light in your eyes?
Was I too distracted?
Did I turn away?
I'm not sure when it happened
Can't exactly say

I don't know why you bother
It happens all the time
Your reflected image
Got caught somehow on mine
Couldn't break the surface
Could only plot a line

Was I too dumb to notice?
Pale light of the moon
Was still there in the morning
That somebody saw there
Diluted in the sky
