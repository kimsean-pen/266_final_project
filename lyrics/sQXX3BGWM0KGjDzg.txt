There are undeniable truths I have learned in my stead
First and foremost you cannot trust a cokehead

The mind of an addict is a single track
All in the pursuit to score some smack

I've lost too many people to bottles and pills or a fucking needle
Too many friends choosing a life chained to a substance

I live in a culture of corruption
Driven by hell bent self medication
No one stopping to ask the question
"What's the endgame to this decision?"
Everyone thinks they've got control
til an overdose brings their fucking fall
