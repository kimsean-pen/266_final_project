Listen, I can hear the voice
I need a helping hand, just to beat the void.
I need a mission, a dream to stop me talking to myself
And now the silence is broken, now my soul is to sell
I need to pick up the pieces, to scatter to the wind
Hold the city to your ears; you can hear the waves come in
You can't change the world with a song
You can't make it right when it's wrong.

I can't stop this music travelling 'round with me, wherever I go, it's playing for
you
I can't stop this voice unravelling randomly, whatever I do, it's talking to you.
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart, beating for you, however you move
So speak to me

Believe, believe, believe me.
Don't let it slip through your finger tips
When there's a ghost, don't try to reason with it
'cause now I'm tired, I'm wired, so I won't miss a thing

I wrote my words up to dry, and I've forgotten what to sing.
But you can't change the world with a song

You can't make it right when it's wrong.
I can't stop this music travelling 'round with me, wherever I go, it's playing for
you
I can't stop this voice unravelling randomly, whatever I do, it's talking to you.
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart, beating for you, however you move

So speak to me
Believe, believe, believe me.
If that's what it was to you, then that's what it was to me

If that's what it was to you, then that's what it was to me
If that's what it was to you, then that's what it was to me.

But you can't change the world with a song
You can't make it right when it's wrong.
I can't stop this music travelling 'round with me, wherever I go, it's playing for
you
I can't stop this voice unravelling randomly, whatever I do, it's talking to you.
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart, beating for you, however you move
So speak to me
Believe, believe, believe me.
Believe, believe, believe me.
