When I met you, you were on your back
We still spend most afternoons like that
But not for long
Well, I find myself enjoying you
But you play these reckless games
You'll never lose
As long as I'm around

Do you want to tie me up?
Do you want to tie me down?
Go ahead and do it now

So far, so good, let it roll, let it ride, ride
So far, so good, let us fall, let us fight, fight
It's no fun on the sidelines

We both know I'm too young for you
And when you fake a laugh behind the wheel
I know where this road is heading to
With a sunken lie I lay in bed
But I will live to be twenty-three
And you'll see just how clever I can be

Do you want to tie me up?
Do you want to tie me down?
Go ahead and do it now

So far, so good, let it roll, let it ride, ride
So far, so good, let us fall, let us fight, fight
It's no fun on the sidelines

Driving backwards, wasting time
Young love is ruthless, so learn to fly
You taught me things I can't forget
Positions that I don't regret
I can't walk away, and I can't shake the taste

Do you want to tie me up?
Do you want to tie me down?
Go ahead and do it now

So far, so good, let it roll, let it ride, ride
So far, so good, let us fall, let us fight, fight
It's no fun on the sidelines

It's no fun on the sidelines, no
Don't write a word, cuz I won't reply
