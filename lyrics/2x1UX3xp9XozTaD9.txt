Big smile for the camera, it's always on
It's all in the protocol, they tapped my phone
Golden idols holding rivals, take my body, anybody
I'm your trophy, make my nose bleed, now you own me

Oh my god, I'm so happy I could die
Oh my god, I'm so happy I could cry
Oh my god, I'm so happy I could die (everybody's doing the
same and it makes me happy, yeah, and it makes me happy, yeah)
Oh my god, I'm so happy I could cry (everybody's doing the
same and it makes me happy, yeah, and it makes me happy, yeah)

No problems in paradise, we'll lock them up
We all gotta sacrifice, it won't be long
Shut the borders, burn the other, sons and daughters, and the mothers
Drink the Kool-Aid, it's a new way, do what I say

Oh my god, I'm so happy I could die
Oh my god, I'm so happy I could cry
Oh my god, I'm so happy I could die (everybody's doing the
same and it makes me happy, yeah, and it makes me happy, yeah)
Oh my god, I'm so happy I could cry (everybody's doing the
same and it makes me happy, yeah, and it makes me happy, yeah)

Golden idols holding rivals, take my body, anybody
I'm your trophy, make my nose bleed, now you own me
