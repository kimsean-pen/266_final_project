I wanted so badly,
Somebody other than me,
Staring back at me,
But you were gone, gone, gone.

I wanted to see you walking backwards,
And get the sensation of you coming home,
I wanted to see you walking away from me,
Without the sensation of you leaving me alone.

Time and time again,
Time and time again,
Time and time again,
I can't please myself.

I wanted the ocean to cover over me,
I wanna sink slowly without getting wet,
Maybe someday I won't be so lonely,
And I'll walk on water every chance I get.

Time and time again,
Time and time again,
Time and time again,
I can't please myself.

So when are you coming home, sweet Angel?
You leaving me alone? all alone?
Well, well if I'm drowning darling,
You'll come down this way on your own.

I wish I was travelling on a freeway,
Beneath this graveyard western sky,
Gonna set fire to this city,
And out into the desert,
Yeah we're gonna ride.

Time and time again,
Time and time again,
Time and time and time again,
I can't please myself.

I can't please myself, and I,
I can't please nobody else and time again,
Time and time again,
Time and time and time and time again,
I can't please myself, no, no, no, no.
