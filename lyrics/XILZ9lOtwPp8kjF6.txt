Laying here dreaming, Staring at the ceiling
Wasting the day away.
The world's flying by
Our window outside
But hey baby that's OK.
This feels so right it can't be wrong
So far, as I can see

Where you wanna go baby
I'll do anything.
If you wanna go, Baby let's go
If you wanna rock, I'm ready to roll
And if you wanna slow down
We can slow down together.
If you wanna walk, Baby let's walk.
Have a little kiss, have a little talk.
We don't gotta leave at all
We can lay here forever
Stay here forever.
Oh Oh Oh Oh

If you wanna see that Italian tower leaning

Baby we can leave right now.
That's too far
We can jump in the car, and take a little trip around town.
They say that California

Is nice and warm this time of year.
Baby, say the word, and we'll just disappear.

If you wanna go, Baby let's go
If you wanna rock, I'm ready to roll.
And if you wanna slow down
We can slow down together.
If you wanna walk, Baby let's walk.
Have a little kiss, have a little talk.
We don't gotta leave at all
We can lay here forever
Stay here forever.
Oh, It's a big world for a boy and a girl

Letting go of it all
Holding on to one another.
Oh, there's a whole lot of world to discover

Under the covers.
If you wanna go, Baby lets go

If you wanna rock, I'm ready to roll
If you wanna slow down
We can slow down together.
If you wanna walk, Baby lets walk

Have a little kiss, have a little talk
We don't gotta leave at all
We can lay here forever
Stay here forever.
Let's just lay here forever
Stay here forever.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
