Was doesn't mean anything to me
Come, show me the meaning of complete
Where did our love go wrong?
Once we were so strong
How can I go on?

When you told me you loved me
Did you know it would take me the rest of my life
To get over the feeling of knowing a dream
Didn't turn out right
When you let me believe
That you weren't complete without me by your side
How could I know?
That you would go, that you would run
Baby, I thought you were the one

Why can't I just leave it all behind?
I felt passion so bright that I was blind
Then something made me weak
Talking in my sleep
Baby, I'm in so deep and you know I believe

When you told me you loved me
Did you know it would take me the rest of my life
To get over the feeling of knowing a dream
Didn't turn out right
When you let me believe
That you weren't complete without me by your side
How could I know?
That you would go, that you would run
Baby, I thought you were the one

Your lips, your face, something that time just can't erase
My heart could break all over again

When you told me you loved me
Did you know it would take me the rest of my life
To get over the feeling of knowing a dream
Didn't turn out right
When you let me believe
That you weren't complete without me by your side
How could I know?
That you would go, that you would run
Baby, I thought you were the one
