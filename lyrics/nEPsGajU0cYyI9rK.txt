They said that your scream was heard through the storm.
It was a desperate noise that shocked the sky.
And they told me about all the holes in your skin.
The needles that've been piercing through you.
It was a pattern of wounds, in a city that's dead.
The blood has to be shed... and wasted.
DEATH IS WASTED
DEATH IS WASTED
Death is wasted on the...
Death is wasted on the dead
And we want you
Psalms are sung but nothing is said
Life is killing you
They said that this day would hurt your young eyes.
And how you shattered from fear, all lame from fright.
And they whispered about all the signs that you made.
The sound of the last breath that you took.
We saw the mother of the dark and a child that was dead.
Her milk has to be shed... and wasted.
DEATH IS WASTED
DEATH IS WASTED
Death is wasted on the...
Death is wasted on the dead
And we want you
Psalms are sung but nothing is said
Life is killing you
DEATH... IS... WA... STED
BURN BURN BURN
BURN BURN BURN
Burn them at the stakes then try to decide
When the night shall explode and the day shall hide.
We're the ones and you're the night's sons
that shall fight this, burn this never to return again.
And we want you
the glorious ones.
Life is killing you
Death is wasted on the dead
And we want you
Psalms are sung but nothing is said
Life is killing you
Death is wasted
And we want you
Death is wasted
And we want you
