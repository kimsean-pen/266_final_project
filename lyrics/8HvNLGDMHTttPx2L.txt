Be my organ now and play for me
Be my witness now and set me free
Be the altar, I'm falling to my knees
And in my wicked hour bring me peace

Be my holy wine and let me drink
Be my wandering mind, teach me to think
Be the silent voice inside of me
And in my wicked hour I hear you speak

Be my organ now and play for me
Be my witness now and set me free
Be the altar, I'm falling to my knees
And in my wicked hour, you said to me

No one owes you anything
But they're keeping tabs on you
And don't know where to begin
No one owes you anything
But they're keeping tabs on you
And don't know where to begin

Be my organ now and play for me
Be my witness now and set me free
Be the altar, I'm falling to my knees
In my wicked hour bring me peace

Be my holy wine and let me drink
Be my wandering mind, teach me to think
Be the silent voice inside of me
And in my wicked hour you start to speak

No one owes you anything
But they're keeping tabs on you
And don't know where to begin
No one owes you anything
But I'm keeping tabs on you
And don't know where to begin
