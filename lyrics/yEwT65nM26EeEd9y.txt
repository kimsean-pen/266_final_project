I was on the road despite the holiday
The winter green day dream softly collided
It took all my headaches away
When did I arrive?
I don't recall ever leaving Alaska
Why do I hate the dark when I'm alone?
I was on my way to a brighter day
I'm still chasing around
But somehow I believe that this is home
It's so good to be home
I was on the ground
When I recalled the day
That my discomposure left me forever
It swept all my troubles away
When did I arrive
I don't recall ever leaving Alaska
Why do I hate the dark when I'm alone?
I was on my way to a brighter day
I'm still chasing around
But somehow I believe that this is home
It's so good to be home
