Oh girl, when you coming back to me

My hands are shaking and my mind is dry
You walked away from me honey and we both know why
What you don't know, what you don't see
That I was made for you and you were made for me
Can't stop thinking that I let you go
Laid it all on the line and nothing to show
I wanna throw you up, I wanna hear your voice
But when I push the button, my hands start shaking

You've got to save me, baby

Oh girl, when you coming back to me

My feet keep slipping as I hit the floor
And I don't know what it is I'm looking for
Tried to make it fast, you've got to take it slow
And before I knew it you were already gone
My hands are stinky and my mind is dry
You walked away from me honey and I don't know why
What you don't know, what you don't see
That I was made for you and you were made for me

You've got to save me, baby

Oh girl, when you coming back to me

Oh girl
