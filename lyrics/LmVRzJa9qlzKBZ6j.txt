We'll start again in a moment of silence
Still couldn't be friends, but I want you to find me when I make sense
Man, 'cause this already hurt you back then
Come, come
Try to stay 'cause this already hurt you
Back then, so far behind you
I feel free, and I want you to find me
I feel free, and I want you to find me

We'll start again in a moment of silence
Still couldn't be friends, but I want you to find me when I make sense
Man, 'cause this already hurt you back then
Come, come
Try to stay 'cause this already hurt you
Back then, so far behind you
I feel free, and I want you to find me
I feel free, and I want you to find me
