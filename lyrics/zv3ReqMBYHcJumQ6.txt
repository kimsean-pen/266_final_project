Didn't I know you, mystery man?
Strange as all new thoughts on impotence.

All, all I want are windows
It wouldn't be the first time.

Didn't I, didn't I know you?
Didn't I, didn't I know you, didn't I know you?
All along, all we've been given is the ugliest tidings.
All along, we've been a mess.
Now quick dilation is the only chance we have left.

A stranger's just someone that you've forgotten.
How will we know if we've met before or done this dance,
Mystery man?

Didn't I, didn't I know you?
Didn't I, didn't I know you, didn't I know you?
All along, all we've been given is the ugliest tidings.
All along, we've been a mess.
Now quick dilation is the only chance we have left.
