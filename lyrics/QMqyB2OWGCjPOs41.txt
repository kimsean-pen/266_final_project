I been starin', I been starin' into space
Always tired, not a smile, such a waste

I don't wanna, I don't wanna know
I can't tell you, I just have to go

Of all the people, of all the people to let me down
Of all the people, of all the people, why now
Save me, save me
Save me, save me

Bring me something, bring me something I can use
Well here's one thing, but it's not the one I choose
I can't help it, hope you show up soon
I can't help it, I'm countin' on you

Of all the people, of all the people to let me down
Of all the people, of all the people, why now
Save me, save me
Save me, save me

Can you tell me, can you tell me what went wrong
Guess I shoulda seen it comin' all along
Gotta fight it, I gotta be strong
Gotta be something, can't let it drag on and on

Of all the people, of all the people to let me down
Of all the people, of all the people, why now
Save me, save me
Save me, save me
