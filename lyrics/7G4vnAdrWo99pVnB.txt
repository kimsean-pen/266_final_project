Oh me oh my oh, would you look at miss ohio
She's a runnin' around with her ragtop down
She says I wanna do right but not right now

I'm gonna drive to Atlanta
And live out this fantasy
Runnin' around with your ragtop down
Yeah I wanna do right but not right now

Have your arm around her shoulder
A regimental soldier
And momma starts pushin' that wedding gown
Yeah I wanna do right but not right now

Oh me oh my oh, would you look at miss Ohio
She's a runnin' around with her ragtop down
She says I wanna do right but not right now

I know all about it
So you don't have to shout it
But imma gonna straighten it out somehow
Yeah I wanna do right but not right now

Oh me oh my oh, would you look at miss Ohio
She's a runnin' around with her ragtop down
She says I wanna do right but not right now
Yeah I wanna do right but not right now
Ooh, ooh, mmm
