You'll never know
Only my soul
Bares the truth, cares for you
Only my soul
You'll never see
Stays here with me
Overload, nothing more
Only my soul

Knew you were ready
Because you had no answers for me

Take me back to where your love grows
Because I don't want to be here anymore

Take me back to where your love grows
I don't want to be here anymore
