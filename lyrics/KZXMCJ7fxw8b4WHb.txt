Paranoid
You got me figured out
Paranoid
Come down it's much too loud
Paranoid
Too long we lived with doubt
I've never run
Til right now

You know that I'm hiding
Can't belong
Shadows that I'm fighting
Make me strong
This throne in my mind is
Keeping me going
Farther than the reach of time

So she said
Baby it's all in your
Head, it's in your mind I guess
This baroness
She always seems to know
Best, I bet she's my common sense

Paranoid
You'll all see when I'm down
Paranoid
Among a troubled crowd
Polaroid
Your pictures fading
Too quickly now
With the sound

You know that I'm hiding
Can't be long
Her warm touch invites me
Makes me strong
The morning in my mind is
Keeping me going
Farther than the reach of time

So she said
Baby it's all in your
Head, it's in your mind I guess
This baroness
She always seems to know
Best, I bet she's my common sense

Beg down for me
If you want me

So she said
Baby it's all in your
Head, it's in your mind I guess
This baroness
She always seems to know
Best, I bet she's my common sense

So she said
Baby it's all in your
Head, it's in your mind I guess
This baroness
She always seems to know
Best, I bet she's my common sense
