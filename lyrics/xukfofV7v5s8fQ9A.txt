Look into the sky and see the pattern
Reflecting in your eyes from a distance
Mirroring the stars are the atoms
Mix it up like a cocktail

The devil's inside of the detail
The tittle runs wild under veil
Coming together in the pattern
Fit tightly like a dovetail

Nuclear fusion
All the bonds that be couldn't break us
Exponentially in fine feather
We're essentially one being
All the bonds that be couldn't tear us
From eventually fusing tightly
We're essentially one being
Nuclear fusion

Ocean like a moat fortification
Separating me from restoration
My spirit leaves my body in frustration
Flying through the world in radiation

The devil's inside of the detail
The tittle runs wild under veil
Coming together in the pattern
Fit tightly like a dovetail

Nuclear fusion
All the bonds that be couldn't break us
Exponentially in fine feather
We're essentially one being
All the bonds that be couldn't break us
From eventually fusing tightly
We're essentially one being
Nuclear fusion

All that I ever see is nuclear fusion
All that I ever hear is nuclear fusion
