Cell phones
& travel stations
Ringtones
& new relations
Say hello
To all your friends for me

Several calls
I made to Thailand
Wound up in
Prince Edward Island
& my head

Feels like it's ready to blow

I served &
Scratched a rainbow
So curved
I felt the pain go

Through my joints
& now I don't wanna play

Swinging down
I sent the birdie
Downtown
At 7: 30
& I'm convinced
That I've got tennis elbow
We are lost
In the sound
Close your eyes
& I will twirl you around
We are lost
In the sound
Close your eyes
& I will twirl you around
We are lost
In the sound
Close your eyes
& I will twirl you around
We are lost
In the sound
Close your eyes
& I will twirl you around
We are lost
In the sound
Close your eyes
& I will twirl you around
