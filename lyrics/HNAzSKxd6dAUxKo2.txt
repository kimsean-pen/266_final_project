In the same way I can't imagine you're a mother,
I can't imagine you are wild.
Raising our beauty queen.
In the same way I can't imagine you're my wife,
I can't imagine you are wild.
The happiest part of me.

But I think I know you, I know you
You can break
I think I know you, I know you
I'm watching away
You're porcelain
You're porcelain
I just want to hold you
You're porcelain

The greatest gift I'm feeling is in loving myself
Without fear of you walking away
Oh this is enough
But I know you, I know you
You can break
You're porcelain
I think I know you, I know you
I watch and wait
You're porcelain
You're porcelain
I just want to hold you
You're porcelain

It's hard to face a life alone
With you, I never will
I believe in you, beautiful

I used to say it'd be ok
And it will
You better love me til the day you're gone
XO until the day I'm gone

You're porcelain
You're porcelain

You're porcelain
You're porcelain
I think I know you, I know you
You can break
You're porcelain
