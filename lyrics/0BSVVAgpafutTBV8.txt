My love, what have you done
with all the time I thought I had?
Come back, don't desert me,
cut from a cataleptic past.

You're still the most peculiar one
I was bent on making you believe you were wrong
and baby, you played along
and I couldn't set you free, you had to save yourself.

Is it too late?
Lost in some haunted place
where the lights end,
where the lights end.
I've gone blind here
surrounded all my fear
in your arms again,
in your arms again.

Black hole love
Your black hole love (x4)

Lock me in love
Patience paid off,
just, take what you want.

I will not protest
I will not second guess
I will not resist
Just like all the rest
(x2)
