Am I on the verge of a really big breakthrough or just another meltdown?
Gratuitous abysses
I've been looking for my friend she became an ocean just to watch me drown
Gratuitous abysses

Staying in touch is making us boring, voiceless is underrated, I think it's dumb and I
Really hate it
I must vilify us to make you special, I know my compass is beyond retrieval, I'm just
'illuminations' and 'flowers of evil'
Like a flittering squirming dying insect you got glued to your ceiling
Gratuitous abysses
I know I'm as rotten as a Chytilovi√°n Daisy but I still got feelings
Gratuitous abysses

Staying connected is making us stupid I want a new grid a swinish fury but since our
Schism it's all so blurry
We're all dolled up for gratuitous abysses you're on her perch and looking sallow I
Want to kiss you but you know I'm so shallow

Staying in touch is making us boring, voiceless is underrated, I think it's dumb and I
Really hate it
I must vilify us to make you special, I know my compass is beyond retrieval, I'm just
'illuminations' and 'flowers of evil'
