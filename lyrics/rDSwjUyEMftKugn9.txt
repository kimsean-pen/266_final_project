Hi, nice to meet you
I already forgot your name
You should be lucky I came
Sorry I'm late I just... didn't wanna come
(Is there wifi in here?)
No satisfaction with this human interaction
No satisfaction with this human interaction
All that talk is hurting in my brain
Can't you see I'm busy?
They say opposites attract
Well they don't know jack
Cos tonight I'd rather be in my room getting high on some wifi
I'm not your lady
So don't call me your baby
Ain't trying to hear what you're saying
(But if you're leaving) I'm staying
All that talk is hurting in my brain
All that chatter really doesn't matter
All that chatter really doesn't matter
Siri, find me an exit
Oh, what where you saying?
I wasn't really listening
Five, six, seven, eight
Here we go again, it's getting late
Cos tonight I'd rather be in my room getting high on some wifi
(Wifi)
Baby, baby, baby
I'm not your lady
Ain't trying to hear what you're saying
(But if you're leaving) I'm staying
