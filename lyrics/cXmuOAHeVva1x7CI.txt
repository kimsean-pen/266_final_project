My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees

The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to sigh like a chime
That flies from a church on a breeze

The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime
That flies from a church on a breeze

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely

To laugh like a brook when it trips

I know I will hear what I've heard before

And falls over stones on its way

My heart will be blessed with the sound of music

To sing through the night

And I'll sing once more

Like a lark who is learning to pray
