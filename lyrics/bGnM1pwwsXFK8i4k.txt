I don't like our situation. No.
Things gotta change around here. Yeah.
Though I don't see no indication,
that that change is very near.
Cause every time I look in your eyes,
I see the girls and all of the lies you tell me.
Just when I think things are alright,
no way my mistake you never change.

Here comes the pain again.
Here comes that pain you bring to me.
Here comes that same old pain again.
Well I don't feel much like feeling that pain.

Call it woman's intuition.
But I don't feel like your sincere no.
Oh and I get these premonitions baby,
one day you'll have me back in tears.
Cause every time I give you my heart,
you take it and you tear it apart so slowly.
Just when I think love is alive,
no way my mistake you let it die.

Here comes the pain again.
Here comes that pain you bring to me.
Here comes that same old pain again.
Well I don't feel much like feeling that pain.
Again, oh again, again.

Well I don't feel much like feeling that pain.

Why should I give my heart,
to have it torn apart?
I gave my best hoping someday things might change for me,
though I cant foresee.
I just know that you'll bring the pain.

Here comes the pain again.
Here comes that pain you bring to me.
Here comes that same old pain again.
Well I don't feel much like feeling that pain.

Don't wanna love you no more,
I'm through with love for sure.
Well don't feel much like feeling that pain.
Don't wanna want to go around,
tired of being let down.
Well I don't feel much like feeling that pain.
Again.
