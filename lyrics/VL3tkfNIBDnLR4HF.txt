Tough times demand tough talk
Demand tough hearts
Demand tough songs

Demand tough talk
Demand tough hearts
Demand tough songs
Demand.

We can rise and fall like empires
Flow in and out like the tide
Be vain and smart, humble and dumb
We can hit and miss like pride
Just like pride.

We can circle around like hurricanes
Dance and dream like lovers
Attack the day like birds of prey
Or scavengers undercover.

Look in
To the eye of the storm
Look out
For the force without form
Look around
At the sight and sound
Look in, Look out, Look around.

Tough times demand tough talk
Demand tough hearts demand tough songs
Demand.

We can move with savage grace
To the rhythms of the night
Cool and remote like dancing girls
In the heat of the beat and the lights.

We can wear the rose of romance
An air of joie de vivre
Too tender hearts upon our sleeves
Or skin as thick as thieves.

Look in
To the eye of the storm
Look out
For the force without form
Look around (Rising)
At the sight and sound (Falling at force ten)
Look in, Look out, Look around. (We twist the world and ride the wind.)

Tough times demand tough talk
Demand tough hearts
Demand tough songs
Demand.

Look in
To the eye of the storm
Look out
For the force without form
Look around
At the sight and sound
Look in, Look out, Look around.

Look in
Look the storm in the eye
Look out
To the sea and the sky
Look around
At the sight and sound
Look in, look out, look around.

Tough times demand tough hearts
Tough times demand tough talk
