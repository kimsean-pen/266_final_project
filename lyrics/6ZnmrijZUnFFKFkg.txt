I think I've found a girl that I can talk to
Yeah I think I've found a girl that just might replace you
She don't care if I got bread
And I remember the things she said
Yeah I think she will do
Uh-huh

Oh
Oh

'Cause when the summertime leaves your town
You know you ain't gonna find me around
I'll be out there to follow the sun
No I ain't gonna take no one
If you thought that you tied me down
Well girl it's high time that you found
Only thing left for you to see
You'll never find another man like me

I don't think I wanna hear 'bout none of your problems
You like to act like the only one who's ever got them
But I know something you don't know
You're gonna reap just what you sow
You stole some time of mine
Now it's time for you to go

Oh
Oh
