I imagine death so much it feels like a memory, like a memory
I wrote some notes and melodies, this is my legacy

Sing it out for me

Rise up
We will wise up
And keep our eyes up
Remembering

Rise up, and open your eyes and you'll
Wise up, and open your eyes and you'll
Eyes up, and open your eyes and you'll
Rise up, and open your eyes and you'll

I planted seeds in the beautiful garden
That I will never see
And they become to a tree
I left some loving fantasies
This is my legacy
Dream it all for me

Rise up
We will wise up
And keep our eyes up
Remembering

Rise up, and open your eyes and you'll
Wise up, and open your eyes and you'll
Eyes up, and open your eyes and you'll
Rise up, and open your eyes and you'll

Open your eyes and you'll see
Open your eyes and you'll
Open your eyes and you'll see
Open your eyes and you'll
Open your eyes and you'll see
Open your eyes and you'll
Open your eyes and you'll see
Open your eyes and you'll
