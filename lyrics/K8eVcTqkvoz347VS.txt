"Drink the wine, my darling" you said
"Take your time, and consume all of it"
But the roses
were only to drain my inspiration

The promises
were spoiled before they left your lips and
I breathe you in again
just to feel you

underneath my skin,
holding on to
the sweet escape is always laced with a
Familiar taste of poison

I tell myself that you're no good for me
I wish you well but desire never leaves
I could fight this 'till the end

but maybe I don't wanna win
I breathe you in again
just to feel you
underneath my skin,
holding on to
the sweet escape is always laced with a

Familiar taste of poison

I don't wanna be saved
I don't wanna be sober
I want you on my mind
In my dreams, behind these eyes
And I won't wake up
No, not this time
I breathe you in again
just to feel you
underneath my skin,
holding on to
the sweet escape is always laced with a
A familiar taste of poison
A familiar taste of poison
A familiar taste... of poison
