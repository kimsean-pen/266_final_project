take me out now
out of my mind
into nothing
out of sight
why would i live for tomorrow
nothing happens at night

nite time
is the right time
c'est la vie
it's the melody

nite time
is the right time
c'est la vie
it's the melody

nite time
is the right time
c'est la vie
it's the melody

nite time
is the right time
c'est la vie
it's the melody

nite time
is the right time
c'est la vie
it's the melody

it's takes everything i've got, not to keep you hanging on
it's takes everything i've got, not to keep you hanging on
it's takes everything i've got, not to keep you hanging on
it's takes everything i've got, not to keep you hanging on
it's takes everything i've got, not to keep you hanging on
it's takes everything i've got, not to keep you hanging on
it's takes everything i've got, not to keep you hanging on
it's takes everything i've got, not to keep you hanging on

nite time
is the right time
c'est la vie
it's the melody

nite time
is the right time
c'est la vie
it's the melody

nite time
is the right time
c'est la vie
it's the melody

no one's watching let's pretend we're alone
love is blind when the lights are low

no one's watching let's pretend we're alone
love is blind when the lights are low

no one's watching let's pretend we're alone
love is blind when the lights are low

no one's watching let's pretend we're alone
love is blind when the lights are low

no one's watching let's pretend we're alone
love is blind when the lights are low

no one's watching let's pretend we're alone
love is blind when the lights are low

it's takes everything i've got, not to keep you hanging on
it's takes everything i've got, not to keep you hanging on

nothing happens at night
nothing happens at night
nothing happens at night
nothing happens at night
nothing happens at night
nothing happens at night
nothing happens at night
nothing happens at night
nothing happens at night
nothing happens at night
