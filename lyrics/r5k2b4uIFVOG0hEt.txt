You got Rimbaud eyes
You got Rimbaud eyes
You got!

Truly, I have wept too much
In the dawns are heartbreakers
Every moon is atrocious, every sun bitter
Sharp love has swollen me up

You got Rimbaud eyes
You got Rimbaud eyes
You got Rimbaud eyes
You got Rimbaud eyes
You got!

I can no more
Bathed in your languors
O waves, sail in your wake
I can no more, I can no more
Bathed in your languors
O waves, sail in your wake

You got Rimbaud eyes
You got Rimbaud eyes
You got Rimbaud eyes
You got Rimbaud eyes
You got!

No I, a boat lost on the blue
Am hurled by hurricanes
Into birdless ether
Into forever blue, into you

You got Rimbaud eyes
You got Rimbaud eyes
You got Rimbaud eyes
You got Rimbaud eyes
You got!
