From the top, from the top
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Fuck nigga you don't want war
Spit bars around your head till' it's gone
My mouths got the clips in the jaw
Put you in the ground then they mourn
Fuck nigga you don't want war
Spit bars around your head till' it's gone
My mouths got the clips in the jaw
Put you in the ground then they mourn

I don't give a fuck about contracts
Wear a lawsuit if you're on that
Used to be broke as fuck doing videos
Now I tour the world with 30 grand in my backpack
We had to split the money three ways
Otherwise, we ain't even getting through customs
Walk from a friend if they seem fake
It looks like life's too short to be running, I think
I really should be happy with the places I've been
I blame my expectations for this lavish life I live
King scarlxrd still scratched on my fist
If life be sending jabs then I take them to the chin
Never gonna stagger, I still stand tall
Think you'll catch me flopping nigga, I ain't got a glass jaw
Wake up in the morning and I browse upon my wish list
I'm prone to handle business, I get everything I ask for
I'm focused on getting higher

Old friends talk shit, say I'm a mean cunt
Had to work hard, I put faith in desire
If someone gave me this life on a plate, I'd be nicer
Stacks increased in my face, now I'm wiser
Every day long nights, I don't get tired
False claims is the game, I'm a lone survivor
Drugs come with the fame, I don't want neither
Dangerous form, I'm breaking the norm
Taking it all, believe in the storm
I'm raging the course, I got no problems
I've handled them all,
there's just no stopping, I got talent, it's raw
Ducking from that broke nigga energy
If it ain't about the money, give it to my enemies
I've been working hard so I don't get to sleep
Plotting on the future, all my movements are hereditary

Fuck nigga you don't want war
Spit bars around your head till' it's gone
My mouths got the clips in the jaw
Put you in the ground then they mourn
Fuck nigga you don't want war
Spit bars around your head till' it's gone
My mouths got clips in the jaw
Put you in the ground then they mourn
