You've such a good taste, it's such a shame to waste
I'm doing you a favor
It's cruel but hey, might not be my place to say
Somewhere there's been a failure

You've missed your moment in the magazines
You're out of date and out of time
Your latest 7 inch sounds obscene
Unless you spin it at 45

That stuff you play, it sounds so passé
Don't get me wrong, I like you

But I don't like your band, your style, your sound
No, I don't like your band, it's tired, not now
I don't like your music, I'm just not into it
It's not you, it's not you, it's your tunes
I don't like your band

Open your mind, you've been so far behind
Your foot upon the razor
Time to get your headphones on
Listening to some cosmic songs
Some Kraftwerk, Bobby O and Moroder

Now let me help you
1, gotta ditch your influences then
2, start it all again
3, buy yourself a sequencer and then
4, let the games begin

That stuff you play it sounds so passé
Don't get me wrong, I like you

But I don't like your band, your style, your sound
No, I don't like your band, it's tired, not now
I don't like your music, I'm just not into it
It's not you, it's not you, it's your tunes
I don't like your band

I feel bad, I feel bad, I feel bad, I feel bad, I feel bad
I feel bad, I feel bad, I feel bad

I don't like your band, your style, your sound
No, I don't like your band, it's tired, not now
I don't like your music, I'm just not into it
It's not you, it's not you, it's your tunes
I don't like your band

I don't like your band
I don't like your band
I don't like your band
I don't like your band
