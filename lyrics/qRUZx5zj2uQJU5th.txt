We started out so awkwardly
There was rain and cold and dark
I wondered why I left the sun behind me
No more brownies in the park
It's a long, long way from California to Berlin
So filled with melancholia
Winter came and paralyzed me
Thrown like gravel over ice
I'm like a polar bear crawling through the tundra
Of some penumbral paradise
As I make my way to pen and paper
My guitar, some weed, imagination
January days blending into grey
But when the magic comes, the clouds get blown away
My troubles, they are ending
My sorrows, they are few
If I write a sunny love song every day
I can shine so bright on you, so true (On you)
My troubles, they have ended (Ended now)
My sorrows ended, too (Ended too)
I should write a sunny love song every day
I will shine so bright on you, so true
