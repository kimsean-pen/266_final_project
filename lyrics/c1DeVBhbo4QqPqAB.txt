I feel the love
I feel the hate
I feel your skin penetrate
I feel love
I feel your hate
Eternal emotions
It's too late

Love hate
Love hate
Love hate
I feel your love
I feel your hate
It's our fate

Starless skies
Now appear
Throwing knives in the atmosphere
Lonely nights
Cursed veil
Love me forever
To no avail

I feel the love
I feel the hate
I feel your skin penetrate
I feel love
I feel your hate
Eternal emotions
It's too late

No explanations
No goodbyes
As we drift
To poisonous lies

Starless skies
Now appear
Throwing knives in the atmosphere
Lonely nights
Cursed veil
Love me forever
To no avail
Deeper and deeper
We drift apart
This love we had
Has no heart
A stranger you will become to me
No goodbyes, just a mystery

I see the lies
In your eyes
Controlled emotions
That hypnotize
Thrown down again
When will this hurt ever end

I feel love, I feel love
Hate, hate
Love, love
Penetrate, penetrate

Starless skies
Now appear
Throwing knives in the atmosphere
Lonely nights
Cursed veil
Love me forever
To no avail
Deeper and deeper
We drift apart
This love we had
Has no heart
A stranger you will become to me
No goodbyes, just a mystery

I feel love
I feel hate
I feel love penetrate
I feel love
I feel hate
I feel skin penetrate
