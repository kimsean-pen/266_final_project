Silence is screaming in my head
Stuck on repeat
Not much longer I'll be dead
So just forget me
I'm losing my mind
And I don't think you could save me this time

And it goes

On and on
And I just feel helpless
how long will this take to wear out?
On and on
When will I get through this?
Welcome to my own down and down

I'm falling deeper in this hole, to disaster
I'm gripping what I thought control, was falling faster
I'm losing my mind
And I don't think you could save me this time

And it goes

On and On
And I just feel helpless
how long will this take to wear out?
On and on
When will I get through this?
Welcome to my own down and down

It's dragging on
I'm wearing thin
I can't stop these walls
They keep caving in
It's gone too far
Where's my mind?
Why can't time stop fear this paranoia?

It's a never end story!
and it starts with me!
It's a never end story!
And it starts with me!

And it goes

On and on
And I just feel helpless
How long will this take to wear out?
On and on
When will I get through this?
Welcome to my own down and down
Welcome, welcome
Welcome to my own down and down
Welcome, welcome
To my own down and down
(I'm falling further)
Welcome to my own down and down
