Snakes, the great deceivers,
governing the minds of man
True falsifiers, coiling
& constricting their master plan
Leeches, cheats & liars
infecting the deepest drinking pools
Pure poison in the mire
where we squirm like worms and defenseless fools.

Snakes and vultures
...you are...
fucking snakes and vultures
...you are...

Vultures, the sinister soars
with talons like knives in your back
Blood feeders, winged death dealers
descending a disguised aerial attack
Ravenous are the regal ravens
like opportunistic thieves picking at your bones
Preying solely upon the weak
raptors commanding carrion thrones

Snakes and vultures
...you are...
fucking snakes and vultures
...you are...

Farewell dreams of liberty
none more enslaved
than those who believe they're free
Forsaken thoughts of prosperity
none more defeated
than those obsolete

Give way the logic of all rationality
none more deprived than
those blinded by greed
Incarcerated within world slavery
none more alive
than we who bleed

Snakes and vultures
...you are...
fucking snakes and vultures
...you are...
