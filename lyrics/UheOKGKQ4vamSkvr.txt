No strings tonight
Nothing to hide
I know you from the inside

Where do we start?
I know your heart
One more ride
Would you wanna, would you wanna?
You could be gone
When the sun comes
Now that we're done
We don't wanna, we don't wanna

No strings tonight
Nothing to hide
I know you from the inside
No strings tonight
Nothing to hide
I know you from the inside

We couldn't see eye to eye
You do you and I do I
We couldn't see eye to eye
You do you and I do I
You do you and I do I
We do it, no strings tonight
You do you and I do I
We do it, no strings tonight

Bittersweet nights
Flickering lights
If we could try
Would you wanna, would you wanna?
We were so wrong
But for so long
I was your home
Now we got it, now we got it

No strings tonight
Nothing to hide
I know you from the inside
No strings tonight
Nothing to hide
I know you from the inside

We couldn't see eye to eye
You do you and I do I
We couldn't see eye to eye
You do you and I do I
You do you and I do I
We do it, no strings tonight
You do you and I do I
We do it, no strings tonight
