He draws his horses
Pretend your anger
And draws his horses
Being chosen also

Please get up
Fall, please get up
Fall, please get up
Don't ruin yourself

So see and hear
Sultitan itan
So see and hear
Plain tiger iger

In my heart
Set you right up
In my heart
I sing this song

Back you up
How messed I am
Back you up
I consider

So he got up
I must see him
I must see him
And all got up

Sore got he
Apalled got up
Apalled got up
I'm in this song

So see and hear
Sultitan itan
So see and hear
Plain tiger iger
