I can tell, seen before
Know the way, I know the law
I can't believe, can't obey
Can't agree with all the things I hear you say

Oh no, ask me why
I can't go on with all the filthy white lies

Stay clean
Stay clean
Stay clean
Stay clean

Don't you know, all the time
You got yours and you know that I have mine
Grab a hold, don't let go
Don't let them rob you of the only thing you know

Oh no, no-one else
Got the right to make you sorry for yourself

Stay clean
Stay clean
Stay clean
Stay clean, alright

So you see, the only proof
Of what you are, is in the way you hear the truth
Don't be scared, live to win
Although they're always gonna tell you it's a sin

In the end, you're on your own
And there is no-one that can stop you being alone

Stay clean
Stay clean
Stay clean
Stay clean, it's your only hope
