It's about life
It's about fun

I hate you, I love you
I just can't remember to forget you
Who are you? Who needs you?
You make me feel alive, I die so high
I'm crawling on the ground, and
I've found I can fly

One of these days it all comes together
One of those days that goes on forever
Think I sound crazy? Maybe, whatever
What's it all about?

It's about life, it's about fun
It's over before it has begun
It's about you, it's about me
It's about everything between, and I say
I'm saying goodbye to you, I say hi to you with no clue
It's about time that I make up my mind

It's simple, confusing
The truth is I'm winning, but I'm losing
And pulling and pushing won't do me any good
It could, it should
I'm honest to myself that the truth is I lied

One of these days it all comes together
One of those days that goes on forever
Think I sound crazy? Maybe, whatever
What's it all about?

It's about life, it's about fun
It's over before it has begun
It's about you, it's about me
It's about everything between, and I say
I'm saying goodbye to you, I say hi to you with no clue
It's about time that I make up my mind

Time is creeping behind me, surrounding around me
Fading the words so desperately
Now give me a reason that I can believe in
Time is something you can't rewind

One of these days it all comes together
One of those days that goes on forever
Think I sound crazy? Maybe, whatever
What's it all about?

It's about life, it's about fun
It's over before it has begun
It's about you, it's about me
It's about everything between, and I say
I'm saying goodbye to you, I say hi to you with no clue
It's about time that I make up my mind

(It's about life, it's about fun, it's about you, it's about me)
I'ts about you
(It's about life, it's about fun, it's about you, it's about me)
And I say
I'm saying goodbye to you, I say hi to you with no clue
It's about time I make up my mind
