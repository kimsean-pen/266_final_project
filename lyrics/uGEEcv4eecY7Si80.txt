What will your life be like in the ground?
Did you figure it out, or die of greed?
There's no way to fight the new diseases
We're here on our own, starting over

Now there's only embers
Why do I remember?
Life is not but rocks and dirt and bitterness now
He'll lose the mother, you and all the others
Who sit and watch the world burning in ourselves

What will your life be like in the dark now?
Did you figure it out, did you feel alone?
There's no way to fight the new diseases
And we're here in the cold 'til it's over

Now there's only embers
Why do I remember?
Life is but a burning rotten stinking ground
Here we're young and ugly, only if we're lucky
We get to watch the ones we love get sick and break down
