Caught up in your turbulence
Gasping for your air and we float
Cans with our chemicals
Away from all our fears, yeah, we grow

And I, and I tremble, yeah
And I, and I tremble with you, with you
And I, and I tremble, yeah
And I, and I tremble with you
Tremble with you

Wishing you were here with me
Your scent still haunts my lips, so sad
Together, we were symmetry
We belong in memory
I can't let you go

And I, and I tremble, yeah
And I, and I tremble with you, with you
And I, and I tremble, yeah
And I, and I tremble with you
Tremble with you
