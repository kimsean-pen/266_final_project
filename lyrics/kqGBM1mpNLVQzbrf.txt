now when the sun come up
I'll be there to say what up in the morning
brush my teeth,
find that clip I've been looking for since last night
I feel so caught up
in the bud
I float somehow in my bedroom
turn around
see myself in the mirror I guess I'm cool
and those happy thoughts
in my head
I'm feelin like I'm Peter Pan
minus the tights and the fairies
happy to see how far I've come
to the same place
it began
my dreams imagination
perfectly at peace
so I move along a bit higher
ill be up up and away

up up and away
cause
they gon' judge me anyway
so whatever
ill be up up and away
up up and away
cause in the end they'll judge me anyway
so whatever
higher
I seen the dreams I've made

so I'm cooler now
i can take care
of my mom and my little niece Zuri
so sing along little mama
you ain't
gotta worry bout no drama no
I provide for friends and fam and fans
who come to see the grindin' man
stay afloat
the key is hope
I never let
a muthafucka break me dog
who gives a fuck
if a nigga dont like your steez
tell em raise off your N.U.T's
we dont care what people say
dudes who critique your clothes are most gay
i aint gotta wait for no one
if i wanna fly
i can fly for freedom
hey
ill be up up and away
up up and away
cause

they gon judge me anyway

so whatever
ill
be up up and away
up up and away
cause in the end theyll judge
me anyway
so whatever

The end is never the end. A new challenge awaits, a test no man could be prepared for. A new hell he must conquer and destroy, a new level of growth he must confront himself. The machine and the ghost within, this is the journey...
of the man on the moon.
