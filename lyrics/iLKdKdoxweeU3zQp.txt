Oh, oh, oh, woke up today
Feeling the way I always do
Oh, oh, oh, hungry for something
That I can't eat, then I hear that beat

That rhythm of town starts calling me down
It's like a message from high above
Oh, oh, oh, pulling me out to the smiles
And the streets that I love

Good morning Baltimore
Every day's like an open door
Every night is a fantasy
Every sound's like a symphony

Good morning Baltimore
And some day when I take to the floor
The world's gonna wake up and see
Baltimore and me

Oh, oh, oh, look at my hair
What do can compare with mine today?
Oh, oh, oh, I've got my hairspray and radio
I'm ready to go

The rats on the street all dance around my feet
They seem to say, "Tracy, it's up to you"
So, oh, oh, don't hold me back
'Cause today all my dreams will come true

Good morning Baltimore
There's the flasher who lives next door
There's the bum on his bar room stool
They wish me luck on my way to school

Good morning Baltimore
And some day when I take to the floor
The world's gonna wake up and see
Baltimore and me

I know every step, I know every song
I know there's a place where I belong
I see all those party lights shining ahead
So someone invite me before I drop dead
(Before she drops dead)

So, oh, oh, give me a chance
'Cause when I start to dance, I'm a movie star
Oh, oh, oh, something inside of me
Makes me move when I hear that groove

My mom tells me no but my feet tell me go!
It's like a drummer inside my heart
So, oh, oh, don't make me wait
One more moment for my life to start
(Good morning, good morning)
(Waiting for my life to start)

I love you Baltimore
Every day's like an open door
Every night is a fantasy
Every sound's like a symphony
And I promise Baltimore
That someday when I take to the floor
The world's gonna wake up and see
Gonna wake up and see
(Gonna wake up and see)
Baltimore and me
(Yes, more or less we all agree)
Baltimore and me
(Someday the world is gonna see)
Baltimore and me
