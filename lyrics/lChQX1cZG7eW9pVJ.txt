Final sign of veracity
In the open palm of your enemy
Going down, down, down
It's a sign of my own denise
A confirmation of my final destination
To a torment of hopeless cries

There's no reason
To believe that I m on my way
See your future in decay
But you won't hear me when I say
So come on

Hear me, see me what I tried to find was
Emancipation of the human mind, cause
Her me see me put your life on the line
A confirmation of your strife
You leave everything behind

Like a drop of blood in the open sea
Revelation hides a tenacity
Going down, down, down
In the fire of enterprise
Indoctrination leads to lethal dedication
No world order to analyze

There's no reason
To believe that I m on my way
See your future in decay
But you won't hear me when I say
So come on

Hear me, see me what I tried to find was
Emancipation of the human mind, cause
Hear me, see me put your life on the line
A confirmation of your strife
You leave everything behind

Like a drop of blood in the open sea
Revelation hides
Feel me, hear me what I tried to say
Liberation was my only way
Here's my reason I tried to decide
If restoration of my pride
Will leave everything behind

Hear me, see me what I tried to find was
Emancipation of the human mind, cause
Hear me, see me put your life on the line
A confirmation of your strife
You leave everything behind
Hear me, see me what I tried to find was
Emancipation of the human mind, cause
Hear me, see me put your life on the line
A confirmation of your strife
You leave everything behind
