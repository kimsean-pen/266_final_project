Take this roof away from me
I'm staying here till something picks me up
Call the boy we used to see
Running wild until he had to stop
Ghosts were rising high in the air
They've been hiding for so long
All these frightened eyes you have spared
They've been scared all along
Take this sertraline relief
I'm down but I have fled the enemy
Shake some prosperous belief
We'll steer towards its immortality
Boy, believe me
Boy, believe me
Ghosts were rising high in the air
They've been hiding for so long
All these frightened eyes you have spared
They've been scared all along
Ghosts were rising high in the air
They've been hiding for so long
All these frightened eyes you have spared
They've been scared all along
Ghosts were rising high in the air.
Ghosts were rising high in the air...
