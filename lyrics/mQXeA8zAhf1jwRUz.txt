Love will always find you
no matter where you hide
love is gonna find you
and it's only just a matter of time

Love's our common hero
it always gets its man
cause love is so much stronger
don't you know it will win in the end
love will always find you

Love will always find you
no matter where you are
love is gonna reach you
cause it's never really that far

No, no man is a island
we weren't born to be alone
life is made for sharing
and love is gonna find you home

I spent my time waiting
I lost my faith in love
just as I was hurting
well then you just turned up

So never give up hoping
you can't see you around the bend
well you be sure of one thing
love's waiting at the end

Love will always find you
no matter where you hide, yeah now
love is gonna find you
it's only just a matter of time

Love's our common hero
it always gets its man
love is so much stronger
don't you know it will win in the end

Love will always find you
no matter where you hide, oh yeah
love is gonna find you
it's only just a matter of time

Love's our common hero
it always gets its man
love is so much stronger
it's only just a matter of time
