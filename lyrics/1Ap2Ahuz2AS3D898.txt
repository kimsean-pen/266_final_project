Stabbed in the back
Left for dead
More or less betrayed
But the fire burns again

Vipers and rattlesnakes
Crawling all around
Broken but not done yet
May the ashes turn to flames

Throw your dark days away
Blackened things just keep on blackening

If you're chasing the light
Feel it within your body
When you're lost into the night
Let your inner sun, your inner sun grow

Stabbed in the back
But never dead
Deceived and betrayed
Let the fire burn again

Throw your dark days away
Blackened things just keep on blackening

If you're chasing the light
Feel it within your body
When you're lost into the night
Let your inner sun, your inner sun grow

If you're chasing the light
Feel it within your body
When you're lost into the night
Let your inner sun, your inner sun grow
