You fell in love with a vampire
You wanna get it for free
Then say hello to the brush fire, baby
You gotta take it from me, I'm gonna take it from you

Say hello to the good times
And say hello to the sun
They're sittin' back on an empire
While the world lays back, puts a kid behind that gun

If we crash this time
They got machines to keep us alive
When the mixtape plays
Choke down the words with no meanin'

I stopped bleedin' three years ago
While you keep screamin' for revolution
Me and my surgeons and my street walkin' friends
We got no heroes 'cause our heroes are dead

Say hello to the program
We're gonna give it for free
up the veins the antibodies
Got it with the disease, we're gonna give it to you

Say goodbye to the good times
You're loadin' up with the fame
You're dressin' up like a virus
But the words get lost when we all look the same

If we crash this time
They got machines to keep us alive
When the mixtape plays
Choke down the words with no meanin'

I stopped bleedin' three years ago
While you keep screamin' for revolution
Me and my surgeons and my street walkin' friends
We got no heroes 'cause our heroes are dead

You fell in love with a vampire
Tops off for the empire
Say hello to the brush fire
The microphone's got a tap wire

You fell in love with a vampire
Tops off for the empire
Say hello to the brush fire
The microphone's got a tap wire

Yeah, if we crash this time
They got machines to keep us alive
While the army wives
Choke down the war with no meanin'

I stopped bleedin' three years ago
While you keep screamin' for revolution
Because rebellion's not a t-shirt you sell
You keep your money and I'll see you in hell
