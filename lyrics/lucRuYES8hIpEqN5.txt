shots wringing out
i'm soaking
eardrums shaking and
years start weighing me
DOWN

crawling out from a
spiral down im fixing now to
mix the white and
BROWN

passing out
running in place
you're the sun and i am your
CLOUD

burning down
running in place
i got so high
i finally felt like
MYSELF

shots wringing out
i'm soaking
eardrums shaking and
the years started weighing me
DOWN

buried deep in a
heroine sleep
and floating deeper
UNDERGROUND

passing out
running in place
you are the sun and i was your
CLOUD

burning down
running in place
got so high finally i felt like
MYSELF

would you give your 81ST year
for a glimpse of heaven, now and here
would you give your 60th year
for a glimpse of heaven, now and here
would you give your 45th year
for a glimpse of heaven, now and here
would you give your 34th year
for a glimpse of heaven, now and here

shots wringing out
