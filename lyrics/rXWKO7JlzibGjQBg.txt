You've got a funny way
of hanging around
A thief in the modern age
of rhythm and sound
Take me to another place
where clarity's found
cause all I hear is noise

It's breaking up my bones
I wanna lie
but I don't care to try
We're taking off
We're taking off baby
We're taking off
It's breaking up my bones
I wanna lie
but I don't care to try
We're taking off
We're taking off baby
We're taking off

You found another way
to keep me around
I dreamt of a thousand ways
to alter the sound
A thief in the modern age
of rhythm and sound
Cause all I hear is noise

It's breaking up my bones
I wanna lie
but I don't care to try
We're taking off
We're taking off baby
We're taking off
It's breaking up my bones
I wanna lie
but I don't care to try
We're taking off
We're taking off baby
We're taking off

So many times we're staring down the barrel of a gun
I know you care, open eyes stare

It's breaking up my bones
I wanna lie
but I don't care to try
We're taking off
We're taking off baby
We're taking off
It's breaking up my bones
I wanna lie
but I don't care to try
We're taking off
We're taking off baby
We're taking off

It breaks up my bones
