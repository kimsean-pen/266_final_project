You're the rain on fallen sidewalks
I'm known to slip and slide
Catering to my delilah
((?))
Threw the sink to the fire
It melt my heart instead
I heard your sign was cancer rising
It's not impossible

Your foreign eyes
And smiles lines look older
You won't say goodbye
She was your sign
She changed your mind
Three times her age still seems fine
For you

Pseudoname my love for hire
You know it's always true
Keeps igniting my desire
Your turned a child polite
I can rise above the turmoil
If I learn to fly

Your foreign eyes
And smiles lines look older
You won't say goodbye
She was your sign
She changed your mind
Three times her age still seems fine
For you

My Delilah's only just a child

The day I have to give it all a rest
Is the day I plan to put myself to rest

Your foreign eyes
And smiles lines look older
You won't say goodbye
She was your sign
She changed your mind
Three times her age still seems fine

Your foreign eyes
And smiles lines look older
You won't say goodbye
She was your sign
She changed your mind
Three times her age still seems fine
