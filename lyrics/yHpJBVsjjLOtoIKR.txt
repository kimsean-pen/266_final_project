I would like a word with you
Kind and justified
I haven't seen the life in you
Forgive me while I try
Time, hasn't done the best for you
Open wide are my
Eyes, deprived of finding you
But I am justified

And
I am a warrior
Not a victim of your pain
I speak for the curious
Infected by your ways (we stand)
I'll stand before you at
The foot of my own grave and speak truth
I'm not the warrior for you

I try, to believe in blind but true
Paralyzing my
Mind, and consequently you
Suffocated by lies,
And acts of pain to prove
That I am justified
By, what I expect from you
While I'm still alive

And
I am a warrior
Not a victim of your pain
I speak for the curious
Infected by your ways (we stand)
I'll stand before you at
The foot of my own grave and speak truth
I'm not the warrior for you

Am I supposed to change?
Am I the only one who feels this way?
Will i find peace again
Or face the end in love with emptiness

And
I am a warrior
Not a victim of your pain
I speak for the curious
Infected by your ways (we stand)
I'll stand before you at
The foot of my own grave and speak truth
I'm not the warrior for you

I am a warrior

I would like a word with you.
