So far, so good... so what?!
After 55 years odd,
Minor things have changed... a lot;
Too sad, if they had not.

One line, it stands out to this day,
When the sadness comes to stay.
Loneliness, it made me forget,
And what is gone, it won't come back.

So far, so good... so what?!
After 55 years odd,
Minor things, they may have changed the plot.
It would be sad, if they had not.
