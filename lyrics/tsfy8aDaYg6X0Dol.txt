Somewhere in the forest
Where the waters meet
Lie the days before us
Spinning on repeat
There's darkness through the doorways
Silence in the streets
There's something in the stillness
A distant memory

Show me love, fill my cup
The world's not empty
It's how you want it to be
Push and pull, the glass is full
Float on an ocean
We're caught up in the motion
So we move
(We just move, we're just moving)
(We just move, we're just moving)

Somewhere in the mountains
And buried in the snow
Life grows underneath us
A thousand leaves below
Sunlight through the windows
Spilling on the streets
No stillness in our orbit
We keep spinning
We keep spinning
On repeat

Show me love, fill my cup
The world's not empty
It's how you want it to be
Push and pull, the glass is full
Float on an ocean
We're caught up in the motion
So we move
(We just move, we're just moving)
(We just move, we're just moving)
(We just move, we're just moving)

We're caught up in the motion
So we move
(We just move, we're just moving)
Push and pull
(We just move, we're just moving)
The glass is full
Float on an ocean
We're caught up in the motion
So we move
Spinning on repeat
