Fallen I have, fallen I am
Cursed and destined to burn
Fallen I have, fallen I am
Cursed and destined to burn

My loyalty towards a liar ceased to exist
Once misled by an empty fraudulent face
I will never turn my back on you
And deceive the flesh of our race

I will always speak truly
So you can understand
No riddles that manipulate
The words and symbols of man

Do not believe false promises
Conspiring to cover up the truth
Find solace in darkness within yourself
And have your legions unleashed

Do not withhold the air
Of your very last breath
In the end of days
You will transcend life and death

Let the one who is fit
Be the king
Of the heavens above
And all worlds down below
