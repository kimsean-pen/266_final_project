Look to my burning eyes
Plead for your worthless life
All remorse I had has died
And all I have is hate inside

You took my soul from me
You took my family
You killed them all ferociously
Now this is what I give to thee

Carved upon your naked back
Blood Eagle!
Skinned alive your ribs are cracked
Blood Eagle!
Still alive you gasp for air
As panic strikes your eyes they stare
Terror grips you dying heart
Blood Eagle!

Helpless on the ground
Hands and feet tightly bound
In my eyes no mercy found
My sharp knife starts to carve around

Penetrate your naked skin
Rip flesh and dig within
With a pleased and twisted grin
I spread your lungs like eagle's wings

The burning grief is tormenting me
The hate I feel is destroying me
Only vengeance will give me peace
Only vengeance will set my spirit free

Carved upon your naked back
Blood Eagle!
Skinned alive your ribs will crack
Blood Eagle!
Still alive you gasp for air
As panic strikes your eyes they stare
Slow death grips your tortured heart
Blood Eagle!
