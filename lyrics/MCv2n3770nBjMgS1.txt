Maybe we're all different
But we're still the same
We all got the blood of Eden running through our veins
I know sometimes it's hard for you to see

You're caught between just who you are and who you want to be
If you feel alone and lost and need a friend

Remember every new beginning is some beginning's end
Welcome To Wherever You Are
This is your life; you made it this far
Welcome, you got to believe
That right here, right now you're exactly where you're supposed to be
Welcome To Wherever You Are

When everybody's in and you're left out
And you feel you're drowning in the shadow of a doubt
Everyone's a miracle in their own way
Just listen to yourself, not what other people say

When it seems you're lost, alone and feelin' down
Remember, everybody's different; just take a look around

Welcome To Wherever You Are
This is your life; you made it this far
Welcome, you got to believe
Right here, right now you're exactly where you're supposed to be
Be who you want to be, be who you are

Everyone's a hero, everyone's a star
When you want to give up and your heart's about to break
Remember that you're perfect; God makes no mistakes
Welcome To Wherever You Are

This is your life, you made it this far
Welcome, you got to believe
Right here, right now you're exactly where you're supposed to be
Welcome To Wherever You Are
This is your life, you made it this far
(I say welcome) Welcome To Wherever You Are
This is your life, you made it this far
(welcome) you gotta believe
Right here right now, Welcome
