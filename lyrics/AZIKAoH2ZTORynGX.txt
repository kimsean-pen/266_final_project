You're thin ice, I should be on solid ground
And oh, so quiet vice, I can hear the cracking sound
But I remain despite your deadly aim,
To drive another lad insane
when you won't speak my name

You kill me with silence
that's your style, girl
You're letting me know
this deafening silence
The only reason that you're in control
you're in control

It's emotional violence,
I can't breathe now,
but I can't let go
You kill me with silence
silence...
silence...

Truth or lies,
things are hoting up in here
If I had a knife,
you could cut the atmosphere
Something else,
I like this bed of nails
That's what I tell myself,
couldn't be much worse in hell

You kill me with silence
that's your style, girl
You're letting me know
this deafening silence
The only reason that you're in control
you're in control

It's emotional violence,
I can't breathe now, but I can't let go
You kill me with silence
silence...

You kill me with silence
Kill me with silence
