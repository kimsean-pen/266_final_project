Take me in your arms
You came and turned your look my way
What else can I say
Love was in my eyes
You came and made my life complete
With your love so sweet
You gave your love to me

Take me, take me in your arms
And don't you let me go
I need you more and more
Repeat

Your love is all I ever need
You're my destiny
This love was meant to be
We'll find a paradise for two
A place for me and you
We'll make our dreams come true
