In a couple rounds 'cause I had it all
I had it all
Never settle down 'cause I had it all
I had it all
But it all just came and went fast than I could
Have the time to separate the bad from good

Didn't really try 'cause I had it all
I had it all
Never question why I had it all
I had it all
But it all ain't really much when all you need
Is the time to let your mind be relaxed and free

Yeah, it all just came and went faster than I could
Had the time to separate the bad from good
Now my days are never few and I can't say
That I have to take it all, I had it all

I had it all
I had it all
I had it all
I had it all
I had it all
I had it all
I had it all
I had it all
