Pack up your things
Your work here is done
A slave to the beast
No mercy with time
No mercy with time

They bound you with the fire
Then push you into the sun
They want the free land to expire
They want everyone to be numb

The world? s drinking from a cup
That no one wants to share
Words from the king
That no one wants to hear

Don't be running late, are you on time today?
Don't be running late, are you on time today?
Don't be running late, are you on time today?
Don't be running late, are you on time today?

Retrench me because of machines
Kids trading roses for guns
Track marks under the sleeve
I can't talk, I need to run

Love's thrown away the ring
Not knowing what to say
Mama won't you say?
It's like you're cut by the blade

Don't be running late, are you on time today?
Don't be running late, are you on time today?
Don't be running late, are you on time today?
Don't be running late, are you on time today?

Don't be running late, are you on time today?
(Don't be running late, don't be running late)
Don't be running late, are you on time today?
(Don't be running late, don't be running late)

Don't be running late, are you on time today?
(Don't be running late, don't be running late)
Don't be running late, are you on time today?
(Don't be running late)

Don't be running late, don't be running late
Don't be running late, don't be running late
Don't be running late, don't be running late
Don't be running late
