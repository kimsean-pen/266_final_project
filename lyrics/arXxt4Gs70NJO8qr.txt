I thought I smyself free
You see I bounce back quicker than most
But I'm half delirious, is too mysterious
You walk through my walls like a ghost

And I take everyday at a time
I'm proud as a lion in his lair
Now there's no denying it, a note to crying it
Your all tangled up in my head

Old habits die hard
And old soldiers just fade away
Old habits die hard
Harder than November rain

Old habits die hard
And old soldiers just fade away
Old habits die hard
Hard enough to feel the pain

We haven't spoken in months
You see I've been counting the days
I dream of such humanities, such insanities
I'm lost like that kid and I'm late

But I've never taken your calls
You see, haven't no block on my phone
I act like an addict, I just got to have it
I never can leave it alone

Old habits die hard
And old soldiers just fade away
Old habits die hard
And harder than November rain

Old habits die hard
And old soldiers just fade away
Old habits die hard
Hard enough to feel the pain

And I can't give you up
Can't leave you alone
And it's so hard, so hard
And it's hard enough to feel the pain

Old habits die hard
Old habits die hard
And harder than November rain

Old habits die hard
Old soldiers just fade away
Old habits die hard
And hard enough to feel the pain

Old habits die hard
Old soldiers just fade away
And old habits die hard
