The bed bugs sleep on the ledge
Above the canyon
They'd called us the restless river
That follows the scent of sublime hay

Their hand [?] had trance
Among the slippery rocks
Of sudden wood
Of sudden wood
We get one chance
Of abandoned force
Where soon we'll grow a frosty town
But I remember
The sparkle of roosters
I break apart the dark

We cuddled in white/whale silk
Of two wee sleeping rats
We felt
We felt
