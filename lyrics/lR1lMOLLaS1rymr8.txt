I got money everywhere!
Falling off the tree
I got money everywhere!
Far as you can see

I painted my way up
I hustled my way up
I'm dealing my way up
I-I-I
I fight for everything I do
I come up and be in my shoes
I bet you can't do what it do
I-I-I

You say that I'm crazy cause I got it going down
Why you gotta hate me cause I got it raining
Down down down
I painted my way up
I hustled my way up
I'm dealing my way up
I-I-I

I got money everywhere!
Falling off the tree
I got money everywhere!
Far as you can see
I look around the room
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
Smell it on the sheets
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
I got money everywhere!
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
Falling off the tree
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)

I make bank while you stay chasin'
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
I did this with no complainin'
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
(I got money everywhere!)
Don't be mad cause you complacent
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
Don't hate just appreciate it
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)

I- cards on the table
I- willing and able
I- and I stay faithful
I-I-I

You say that I'm crazy cause I got it going down
You said you gon' hate me just cause they gon' pay me
And I got it raining now, now, now
I- work always come before play
I- givin' my lovin' away
I- come back in every way
I-I-I

I got money everywhere!
Falling off the tree
I got money everywhere!
Far as you can see
I look around the room
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
Smell it on the sheets
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
(Oh, oh, oh)
I got money everywhere!
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
(I've got money everywhere)
Falling off the tree
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
I got money everywhere!
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
Everywhere I go I see
Got it falling from the tree
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
Everywhere I go I see
Got it falling from the tree!
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)

(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
Ask me how it feels I can't say
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
Give emotions that's unspeakable
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
Unspeakable, oh
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
Moments like this it's so worth it
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
All I know is that I'm grateful
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
Oh
(Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
I got money everywhere
