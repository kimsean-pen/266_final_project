You try to fool me and lose me in your excesses
You're so see-through in your very tight dresses
As you drown in your glass of cointreau
And I drop off to sleep in the gloom
We're still running round in circles
We're still running round in circles
As the smoke from your cigarette spirals
You're so clever at hiding your guilt
We're still running round in circles
We're still running round in circles
You try to fool me and lose me in your excesses
You're so see-through in your very tight dresses
We're still running round in circles
We're still running round in circles
You try to fool me and lose me in your excesses
You're so see-through in your very tight dresses
As you drown in your glass of cointreau
And I drop off to sleep in the gloom
You try to fool me and lose me in your excesses
You're so see-through in your very tight dresses
As the smoke from your cigarette spirals
You're so clever at hiding your guilt
You try to fool me and lose me in your excesses
You're so see-through in your very tight dresses
