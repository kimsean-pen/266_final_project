I see you move, and I do understand, why you get attention
And I hear you talk, but I don't comprehend, why I get no mention

And you know, you know where to find me
Yeah you know where to go when you're looking for love
And you know, you know where I'm hiding
Yeah you know, Yeay you know

When the stars go out, you can rest your love on me
And when the world gets loud, baby you can rest your love on me
When the stars go out, you can rest your love on me (yeah you can rest your love on me
And when the world gets loud, baby you can rest your love on me (yeah you can rest your love on me)

I just tried to get into your space, then I learnt my lesson
I saw the time as it turned into days, you need some rejection

And you know, you know where to find me
Yeah you know where to go when you're looking for love
And you know, you know where I'm hiding
Yeah you know, yeay you know

When the stars go out, you can rest your love on me
And when the world gets loud, baby you can rest your love on me
When the stars go out, you can rest your love on me (yeah you can rest your love on me
And when the world gets loud, baby you can rest your love on me (yeah you can rest your love on me)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (yeah you can rest your love on me)

Yeah you know, you know where I'm hiding
Yeah you know, yeah you know
And when the stars go out, you can rest your love on me

When the stars go out, you can rest your love on me
And when the world gets loud, baby you can rest your love on me
When the stars go out, you can rest your love on me (yeah you can rest your love on me
