This is the sign
I use to wear
This is the line
It says I care
I found a reason
I found a tear
Last year
I am a boy
You want a man
I am indifferent
You want a plan
I'm getting out
I'm getting there
Next year

We are in love
We are at war
I feed myself
You feed the poor
I write the fiction
You write the lore
These are addictions
I've seen before
And if I get out
I won't be saved
You are my keeper
I am your slave
You're in my thoughts
You're in my way
Keep all the weakers
Bury the brave

This is a game
You're involved
I am the player
You have control
There is an ante
There is a toll
Buy in
I want a space
You want a home
You need to have it
You need to own
Let's build a flower
Let's watch it grow
And die

We are in love
We are at war
I feed myself
You feed the poor
I write the fiction
You write the lore
These are addictions
I've seen before
And if I get out
I won't be saved
You are my keeper
I am your slave
You're in my thoughts
You're in my way
Keep all the weakers
Bury the brave
