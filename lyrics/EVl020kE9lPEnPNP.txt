I walk a winding road
every step a heavy load
my heart became a ball and chain
that I drag along this dirty road

weeds hide a bowman's knot (?)
promises we soon forgot
now our lives forever intertwined
untangle me

We grow like creeping vines
strangling our hearts and minds
pry your eyes to watch the waters rise
It's suffocating time

we chase after the sinking sun
all alone but still with everyone
now our lives forever intertwined
untangle me
