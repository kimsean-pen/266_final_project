Spot in the crowd, singin' loud
I'd see her always hangin' around
Always hangin' around
Night after night, traffic light
She's probably let me but i acted polite,
acted polite

Because time's in my way,
But there's a chance for us today

So, wrap me up in your love girl, yeah
Just wrap me up in your love, oh
I can't stop it, no i can't make you stay
And wrap me up in your love

You did what you did, then you hid
But you still can't be hangin', hangin' around
Turn me up-side down
You did what you did, then you hid
And now i never see you hangin' around, hangin around

Spot in the crowd, singin' loud
It's kinda lonely
Haven't seen you around, haven't seen you around
Night after night, traffic light
Well she'd still let me but she's outta my sign, outta my sight

Her eyes keep lookin' away,
like there's nothin' left to say

So, wrap me up in your love girl, yeah
Just wrap me up in your love, oh
I can't stop it, no i can't make you stay
And wrap me up in your love

Wrap me up in your love girl
Just wrap me up in yor love, oh
I can't stop it, no i can't make you stay
And wrap me up in your love

(Wrap me up in your love) x5

Biggest regret I'll ever have
Was hating myself, one check i could've cashed
And now i stand here waiting
Ready to make this work

Wrap me up in your love girl, yeah
Just wrap me up in your love, yeah
I can't stop it, no i can't make you stay
And wrap me up in your love

Wrap me up in your love girl
(Wrap me in up in your love)
Just wrap me up in your love
(Wrap me up in your love)
I can't stop it, no i can't make you stay
And wrap me up in your love

Wrap me up in your love
