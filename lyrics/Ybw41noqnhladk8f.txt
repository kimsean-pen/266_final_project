One and only night, you don't have to leave at all
A car rolls up outside on time, a moment from your call
A handshake seems more fitting than a kiss
Such a shame that you and I should have to end like this

Can't we just sit down and talk it over?
Surely you can ask the better way
Strange that you're the one so set on leaving
And I'm the one who said last night that it was all too late

Can't we just sit down and talk it over?
Who knows maybe in a little while
We'll forget our pride and the things we said last night
And maybe you and I can talk it out

Tonight stay somewhere warm, they say it's gonna freeze
You may not find a place at all, so be sure and take your keys
I can almost taste the silence now
Does it really matter still who was wrong, who let who down?

Oh can't we just sit down and talk it over?
Who knows maybe in a little while
We'll forget our pride, and the things we said last night
And maybe you and I can talk it out

Hold on, hold on, surely you and I can talk it out
Hold on, hold on, surely you and I can make it right
Hold on, oh hold on, yeah, can't we just sit down and talk it over?
Hold on, hold on, yeah, hold on
