I came back to breathe the smoke
I've got a system that I'm using my head
(Talk that talk)

Close enough to stay afloat
But you can sink with all the weight you've been fed

Pulled and pried
A push don't make it right
Lost so easily
Tell me what you're doing

Top shelf guy
Supermarket price
Don't think much of me
Tell me what you're doing

I want it all
Don't stop givin'
I like the way you talk
Just do it
Don't hit the wall
Can't stop livin'
Do anything you want
Just do it
Ooooo

Precious toys don't work for play
They make a killin' sittin' out of the game
(Talk that talk)
Make that choice to be okay
There's nothing to it when you making it rain
Taking fight

Falling from a height
Sounds the same to me
Tell me what you're doing
Eye's shut tight
Keeping up the light
Means I disagree
Tell me what you're doing

Just do it
I want it all
Don't stop givin'
I like the way you talk
Just do it
Don't hit the wall
Can't stop livin'
Do anything you want
Just do it
Ooooo
Just do it
Ooooo
Just do it

Use something
Prove something
Now, now, now

Choose something
Move something
Now, now, now

Do something
Do something
Do something
Do something
Do something
Do something

Just do it
I want it all
Don't stop givin'
I like the way you talk
Just do it
Don't hit the wall
Can't stop livin'
Do anything you want
Just do it
Ooooo
Just do it
Ooooo
