Let my guard down, throw me on the floor
I lost the only crutch I had
Another failsafe, another guarantee
I'll surrender with a "let me be"

And now I promise that I'm not the only cynic
I'm feel so numb to the world, so numb to the world
So frail, so pessimistic
I never wanted to be this way

Dusk awaits bringing somber feelings
Forever hiding behind the mask I made
I walk the same path every day
It gets darker but it feels the same

The truth is lost
Where do I turn when I question myself?
Where do I turn when I lose someone else?
The truth is lost

I lost faith in you
I lost faith in me
I lost faith in you
I lost faith in me

And I'm clinging to the here and now, and I'm feeling like I never felt at all
Draped in a cloak that hides my skin, but not my shame
Ease my mind beyond what I've been feeling
This is the real me and I want out alive

Dusk awaits bringing somber feelings
Forever hiding behind the mask I made
I walk the same path every day
It gets darker but it feels the same

Where do I turn when this aura surrounds me?
Where do I turn when I question myself? I'm losing sleep
Where do I turn when this aura surrounds me?
Where do I turn when I question myself? I'm losing sleep, I'm losing sleep
