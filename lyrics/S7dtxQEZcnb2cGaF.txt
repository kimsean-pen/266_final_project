I know that what you said was a lie.
You do it more than often.
No more like every time.
Now do you see what I see?
How does it look from up there on your pedestal?
I just want to know.
I can see through the lies you spit at him
He'll try to stand his ground
He'll try to win
You just keep pushing away
And after all, he wants to see your face,
to feel your lips for one last taste,
feel your embrace (feel your embrace)
Did it hurt when you left - hurt when you left me?
(What's the reason you left me?)
Did it hurt when you left - hurt when you left me?
(What's the reason you left me?)
Can you think on your own?
I've got these words on the tip of my tongue while I'm looking down at you on my chest.
What's the reason you left me?
He lays in bed; his eyes dried out
"Where have you been? Who have you been with?", he says, "I never wanted any of this."
After all, he wants to see your face,
to feel your lips for one last taste,
feel your embrace (feel your embrace)
Did it hurt when you left - hurt when you left me?
(What's the reason you left me?)
Did it hurt when you left - hurt when you left me?
(What's the reason you left me?)
Can you think on your own?
Still got these words on the tip of my tongue while I'm looking down at you on my chest.
What's the reason you left me?
I knew you were done from the start so go on and leave.
I knew you were done from the start so go on and leave.
I don't remember what it's like to feel this
I can't go on without anything that i miss
-Like your face and the way it gets caught up on the weight of my kiss.
I know that what you said was a lie.
You do it more than often.
No more like every time.
