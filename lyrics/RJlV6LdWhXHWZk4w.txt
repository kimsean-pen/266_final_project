War's coming
Start running
Eyes blinded by the nuclear blast
Hearts beating
Retreating
All around are bodies burned to ash
Children crying and people dying
No salvation from this holocaust
Bodies burning
And now they're learning
In war, painful death's the bloody cost

Life ends in sin
God cries, the world dies

And then there were none
The world starts to burn
The world powers learn
That Satan's work is done

Wheels grinding the glare's blinding
Bullets flying all around your head
Tanks crushing and soldiers rushing
If you live you'll wish that you were dead
Stop praying there's no saving
No salvation from your fiery grave
Brains swelling bodies smelling
And satan comes to see that no one's saved

Life ends in sin
God cries world dies

And then there were none
The world starts to burn
The world powers learn
That satan's work is done
