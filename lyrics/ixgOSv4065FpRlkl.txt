Take a song from the first time you made me introduce them
She was looking, her mind just oblique
She called me baby, and was a mean lady with the song on the radio
So I told her I was rich,
then she asked could I use a dirty bitch (of course)
Then she said, 'No one loves me... neither do I'
You get what you give,
And give goodbye
'N if I should vanish
Don't get caught off guard
Don't hold it against me
Unless it gets her
(Oh... oi... oo... oop!...
aaawhhha... yea... aaawhhha... that's right...)
Well if sex is a weapon, then smash, boom, pow,
How do you like me now?
You can't always do it right, you can always do what's left
So I told her I was trash,
she wait til after and said 'I already know...
I've got a beautiful place to put your face' and she was right,
And I said, 'No one loves me... neither do I'
It makes perfect sense,
So I heard her ask 'why?'
I've got tomorrow
'Cuz life doesn't wait
You can keep your soul
I don't wanna soul mate
Cutting her loose, I'm ready to go
People in the world, your gonna lose control
Cut me a noose, I'm ready to go
People in the world, your gonna lose control
Cut me a noose, I'm ready to go
People in the world, your gonna lose control
Cut me a noose, I'm ready to go
People in the world, your gonna lose...
I know how to burn with passion
Hope nothing backfolds future ration
Give all you are, to not make haste
Save our revery, single taste
You get... cut
I know how to be controlled
Do what they said so, what your told
Quick to react, to break the box
Turn on queue, as your cell door locks
Behind you
I know how to be lost in lust
Not because you should, but because you must
It burns white hot, and so climbs the mile
This lightening strike isn't always cut
So use me up
Use me up
