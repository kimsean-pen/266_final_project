Let me be in my room
Play guitar right next to you
Let me lay out in the sun
Smoke some weed with everyone
And if you're ever wonderin'
You should know where my head goes
When it goes
Let me be, let me stay
Some things change and move away
Let me hang out in the sun
On the stoop with everyone
And if you're ever wonderin'
You should know where my head goes
When it goes
You should know where my head goes
When it goes
I am trying, I am smiling
In my light, in my heart
Doesn't make you so far
Let me be, let me be the one who gets to know you
And if you're ever wonderin'
You should know where my head goes
When it goes
You should know where my head goes
When it goes
I am trying, I am smiling, yeah
