I can't believe the way you showed everyone
Couldn't they see what you could do, everyone?
I know it took you a while to get to California
I had no idea I was waiting on you

I can't believe the way we flow
I can't believe the way we live together
I can't believe the way we flow
I can't believe the way we flow

I could've used you in the early days
Well, it's been such a long, long, long, long time
With the music of my mind
Most of it seems unfinished now
I can't believe the-

I can't believe the way we flow
I can't believe the way we live together
I can't believe the way we flow
I can't believe the way we flow

Nothing makes a sound
(When you're not around)
When you're not around
(You are, you are, my fear of death)
You are my fear of death
(So wave, so wave, so wave my fear of self)
You wave my fear of self
(And alone in the shore)
And alone in the shore
Despite what I was told
I'm finding I'm a smaller piece
Than I once thought
Oh, no, I really am
I really am

We follow, we flow, we flow oh no
Can't believe the way we flow
We follow, we flow, we flow oh no
Can't believe the way we flow
We follow, we flow, we flow oh no
Can't believe the way we flow
We follow, we flow, we flow oh no
Can't believe the way we flow
We follow, we flow, we flow oh no
Can't believe the way we flow
We follow, we flow, we flow oh no
Can't believe the way we flow
