I can play the fool you need
Not giving up
I can break the rules, you'll see
I'm not giving up
Make me naked, up to you

You can't take enough of me
You can have the only part I need
You can't take enough of me
Even more, the lie you can't repay

I am not letting go
I am not letting go
No matter what to do
I am not letting go
I am not letting go
No matter what to do

And I can play your fool
Make me naked, up to you
And I can break the rules, you'll see
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving up

You can't take enough of me
You can have the only part I need
You can't take enough of me
Even more, the more you can't repay

Hollow me, hollow me, hollow me
Hollow me, hollow me

I am not letting go
I am not letting go
No matter what to do
I am not letting go
I am not letting go
No matter what to do

I am not letting go
I am not letting go
No matter what to do
I am not letting go
I am not letting go
No matter what to do
