Well, I've stuck out in your street
And I'm lookin' for some kind of halo
When somebody says to me, boy
She's too young to know

* well, I didn't make your time
I never said you were mine
Don't you think you show
I guess I'll have to teach you how to roll

Met you outside school
When sure no one was lookin'
And your teacher looks at me,
All his envy growin'

* repeat

I said, take it easy baby,
You sure know what's showin'
And I can't help myself
Without your friends all knowin'

* repeat
* repeat
You got a long, long way to go
