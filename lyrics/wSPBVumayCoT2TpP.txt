He would never do graffiti or vandalize that house, no oh
And he would never be caught spray painting on that persons wall, no oh
But no one has seen or heard from him since last wednesday
No one has seen or heard from him since last wednesday

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

He would never buy a weapon or bring me to our war, no oh
He would never be foolish and lie about it now, no oh
But no one has seen or heard from him since last wednesday
No one has seen or heard from him since last wednesday

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

No one has seen or heard from him since last wednesday
No one has seen or heard from him since last wednesday

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
