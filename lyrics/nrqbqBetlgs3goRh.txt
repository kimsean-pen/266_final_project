You say you like extreme sports
Like taking chances in all sorts
You say you live on the edge
Are you taking up too much space?
It's time to pay the piper
It's time to put on your diaper
Time has come to wipe the smile right off your face

So bang your head against the wall
And make your final telephone call
Last room at the end of the hall
You hear them calling, whoa

Get ready for the ride
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and die
See you on the other side
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and die
Graduate from Holloman high
With flying colors
Whoa, say goodbye
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and die

Your mama told you not to
Go get another tattoo
But you don't ever listen
To what that bitch has to say
You wanna push the limit
Break the law and do cool shit
So stick around, kid
You're gonna meet the Grim Reaper today

So bang your head against the wall
And make your final telephone call
Last room at the end of the hall
You hear them calling, whoa

Get ready for the ride
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and die
See you on the other side
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and die
Graduate from Holloman high
With flying colors
Whoa, say goodbye
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and die

Goodbye

Whoa!

Get ready for the ride
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and die
See you on the other side
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and die
Graduate from Holloman high
Let them come louder
Whoa, say goodbye
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and die
