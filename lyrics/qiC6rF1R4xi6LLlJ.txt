oh heaven sends him down to me
and he's got everything I'll ever need
just for 16 days, i let him tie down
the frailest part of my body

i am small but in your arms
you are colder in your heart
i am worthless in your arms
but you offer this protection no one else has given me

you just keep talking down to me
taking all of my hair pulled back
i gave him 16 days
i let him choke out the frailest part of my body

hush now, here there is no trouble
quiet down, you know that i have got you
but I'm spinning out into a bottle
where's my connection to you
it's my protection
