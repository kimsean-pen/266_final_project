Smoke-swell haze on the hill over Tennessee
Leaky churches
Honey-burned tobacco leaves
Girl, teal-eyed, do occupy this tree with me
Summer peelings

The rose-set road will bend around
The earth you knew is waiting for you, dear
Some wave-swept gold drips from your mouth
The hazel hounds move south
To meet you here
Sky gone a certain shade of blue
The kind that heaven's fixin' up for you
Boy, that sure-fire desire is true
Raw hands heart-beating to the smoky view

Warm glow morning soaked in pastel tea
Soulful, soulful kids stamped to the concrete
Tryna be a paintbrush
Searching for a better seat
Summer peelings

Arm's length, shoulders wide
Looking for a fight
Peace sign, getting by
People, we'll be alright
Arm's length, shoulders wide
Looking for a fight
Peace sign, getting by
People, we'll be alright
Arm's length, shoulders wide
Looking for a fight
Peace sign, getting by
People, we'll be alright
Arm's length, shoulders wide
Looking for a fight
Peace sign, getting by
People, we'll be alright
Arm's length, shoulders wide
Looking for a fight
Peace sign, getting by
People, we'll be alright
