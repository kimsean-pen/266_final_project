The young ones
Darling, we're the young ones
And young ones
Shouldn't be afraid

To live, love
While the flame is strong
'Cause we may not be the young ones
Very long

Tomorrow
Why wait until tomorrow?
'Cause tomorrow
Sometimes never comes

So love me
There's a song to be sung
And the best time is to sing
While we're young

Once in every lifetime
Comes a love like this
Oh, I need you and you need me
Oh, my darling, can't you see?

Young dreams
Should be dreamed together
And young hearts
Shouldn't be afraid

And some day
When the years have flown
Darling, then we'll teach the young ones
Of our own

Once in every lifetime
Comes a love like this
Oh, I need you and you need me
Oh, my darling, can't you see?

Young dreams
Should be dreamed together
And young hearts
Shouldn't be afraid
And some day
While the years have flown
Darling, then we'll teach the young ones
Of our own
The young ones
Darling, we're the young ones
The young ones
Darling, we're the young ones
