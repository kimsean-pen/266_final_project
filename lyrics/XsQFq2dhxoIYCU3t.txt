Surrender.
Then start you engines
You'll know quite.
Soon what my mistake was
For those on.
Horseback or dog sled
You turn on.
At the bend in the road

I hear she.
Still grants forgivenesss
Although I.
Willingly forgot her
The offe... ring is molasses
And you say.

I guess I'm an underwater thing so I guess I can't take it personally
I guess I'm an underwater thing, I'm

Liquid running
There's a sea secret in me
It's plain to see
I-It is rising
But I must be flowing
Li... quid diamonds
Li... quid.
Liquid diamonds.

Calling for my soul
A-At the corners of the world
I know she's playing poker
With the rest of the stragglers

Calling for my soul
At the corners of the world
I know she's playing poker

With the.
Rest
The rest

And if your.
Friends don't come back to you
And you.
Know this is madness
A lilac.
Mess in your prom dress

And you say.

I guess I'm an underwater thing so I guess I can't take it personally
I guess I'm an underwater thing, I'm
Liquid running
There's a sea secret in me
It's plain to see
I-It is rising, but I must be flowing
Li... quid... diamonds
Li... quid
Li... quid... diamonds, I call
I go inside a shell I see it's old
And you're doing oh so well these days!, you
Do it again and I say it's coming back again
Something like that
The Saturday, such was it
Can he bring me those dreams?
Keep it back
Daddy's down
Preaching back into himself
Keep it just between... us
It's li... quid
Li... quid
Liquid.
