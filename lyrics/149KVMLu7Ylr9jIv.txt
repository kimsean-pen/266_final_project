So at last you're free
It's the way you wanted it to be
It's the price you pay
To be called a woman of today

Is it worth the pain to see the children cry?
Does it hurt when they ask for Daddy?

Hey hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen
Can you make it alone?

So you're free at last
And are beginning to forget the past
Does it make you sad?
When you think about the life you've had

But you're right, you had to take a second chance
So you fight, it's a fight for your freedom

Hey hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen
Can you make it alone?

Hey hey Helen, hey hey Helen
(What's the matter with you?)
Hey hey Helen, hey hey Helen
(Don't you know what to do?)

Aah, yes you do, yes, you do
Aah, yes you do, yes, you do

Hey hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen
Can you make it alone?

Hey hey Helen, hey hey Helen
(What's the matter with you?)
Hey hey Helen, hey hey Helen
(Don't you know what to do?)
