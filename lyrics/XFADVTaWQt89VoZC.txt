Since we were born
We grew apart
And it all goes miss my heart
But our dream will come true
And I'll always stand by you

For all the countless hours we were fought
For all the times you lost your calls
When tears are in your eyes
Don't hold it inside
Cause you don't need to hide
I'll be by your side
I'll do what I must
I hope that you trust in me

I know you remember you were taken away
How did that let you escape
And I still owe you since these days
It shouldn't have been the end your place
