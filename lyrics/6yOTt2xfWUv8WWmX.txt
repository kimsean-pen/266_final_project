My soul I
Am broken
By you
One mornin' I'll wake up
Renewed
Don't go love
I need you to stay
My soul I
Am broken
Today
And I will work out what it meant
And I will mend you in the end
Cause I'll do anything, I love you
Love you
I'll do anything, I love you
Love you
It may not be easy to see
But I'm ready I need to
Believe
And I will work out what it meant
And I will mend you in the end
Cause I'll do anything, I love you
Love you
I'll do anything, I love you
Love you
You-ooh, you-ooh
You-ooh, you-ooh
You-ooh, you-ooh
You-ooh, you-ooh
End
