I could've fucked her for days
But thinking bout it
Maybe I just thrive on the chase
I'm in love (lost)

And you never take time to look through
Everything I try, try to do for you

And you, you, you need the proof, proof, proof you're in it
And let go of every fear you had

Lay low, lay low
She knows, she knows
Blow out straight to my brain
Works the best when she's complaining

And I say give me a break
I'm only human

Fucked with too many petty bitches, ain't got time for this shit
Those peasant pussies probably took it but you'll take what you get
I know, I know it's supposed to be give and take
It's just a show and I'm the one that takes the blame

Don't stop faking my conscience ain't afraid of you yet
And if your soul's still fading I'm done contemplating with it

You're not a victim of shit
I put myself on the back burner
Held myself back for you
I'm a disposable fix
I'm only stating the facts
And now I've got nothing to lose, no
