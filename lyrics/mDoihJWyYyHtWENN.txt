I don't want you gone.
That was once you calling just to check up on me.
I could make it by, now she's got me falling and soon I will be nothing.
You know she wants to help, she's gonna be there for you.
You say I never take for anyone.
Maybe I don't but I hate the taste.
I slowly started fading, but now I'm feeling better.
Got blinded in two places but found out which one mattered.
You know you aren't gonna have her long, they're gonna leave you too.
