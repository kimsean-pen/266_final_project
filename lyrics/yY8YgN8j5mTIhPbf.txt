In a blur you took me captive
Lost in a natural high
Like a spell I'm so enchanted
Right before you said goodbye

Forsaken
Only me
Unshaken
Underneath

Mistaken
Forget me
Awaken
Incomplete

Incomplete

Tunnel vision moving slowly
No end and no escape
Always running must be lonely
But something new is taking shape

Forsaken
Only me
Unshaken
Underneath

Mistaken
Forget me
Awaken
Incomplete

Incomplete
Incomplete
Incomplete
Incomplete
Incomplete
