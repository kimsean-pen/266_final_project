Deliver ghosts
To the crowd
The distant
And sequestered
Emerge again

Immorality
A small trace in
Half light
A dull relic

Emerge
Again
Sequestered
In small trace
I materialize
A satire

Immortality
Delivered ghosts
In half light
A dull relic

Small traces
Materialize
Delivered ghosts
In half light

Emerge
Again
Dull relic
Half light
Delivered
Ghosts
Distant
And sequestered

Locked-grooves
I materialize
A halfway distance

In small trace
Immortality
