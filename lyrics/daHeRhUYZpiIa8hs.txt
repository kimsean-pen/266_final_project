Can't believe you're here with me
Ain't no soul could ever compete
Babay, babay-y
I will wait forever, oh
Nothing compares to the things that you do
I wanna be with you
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling
Be here with me

Be here with me
Be here with me
Be here with me
Be here with me

I will worship everyday
By your side I always will stay
Babay, babay-by
I'll be here forever, oh no
Nothing compares to spiritual high
Make me feel fine
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling
Be here with me

Be here with me
Be here with me
Be here with me

Be here with me
Be here with me
Be here with me
Be here with me

(Be here, be here)
Be here with me
(Be here with me)
Be here with me

Be here with me
Be here with me
Be here with me
Be here with me
Be here with me
