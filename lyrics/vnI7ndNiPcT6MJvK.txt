I ain't afraid o' no ghost

If you're seein' things runnin' through your head

(Ghostbusters!)

An invisible man sleepin' in your bed
Oh who ya gonna call?

Of a freaky ghost baby

Let me tell you somethin'
Bustin' makes me feel good
I ain't afraid o' no ghost
I ain't afraid o' no ghost

Unless you just a want some more

(Ghostbusters!)

Oh, who you gonna call?
