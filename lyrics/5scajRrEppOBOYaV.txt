Go on and steal my breath away
Come on and hurt me more today
I tried to picture my escape
But I'm caught in a prism

Come over, lie to build me up
When did your innocence corrupt?
Can't help to drown, you fill me up
And I fall for your vision

Your words are knives
Just stick in me
Decorated strategies
You are never far away, oh

I don't like you human
You remind me of the things I hate in me
I don't like you human
'Cause you show me how imperfect I can be

Human, you're so lonely, lonely, lonely
Human, I guess you're only, only, only human
Human, I guess you're only, only, only human
Human

You leave the venom when you bite
Hunting another prey at night
You're thinking I'm too weak to fight
You don't see I'm the villain

Trigger happy point at me
Just pathetic weaponry
Are you never gonna change? Oh

I don't like you human
You remind me of the things I hate in me
I don't like you human
'Cause you show me how imperfect I can be

Human, you're so lonely, lonely, lonely
Human, I guess you're only, only, only human
Human, I guess you're only, only, only human
Human

Human, human, human, human
Human, human, human, human

I don't like you human
You remind me of the things I hate in me
I don't like you human
'Cause you show me how imperfect I can be

Human, you're so lonely, lonely, lonely
Human, I guess you're only, only, only human
