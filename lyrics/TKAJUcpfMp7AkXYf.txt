Well, I know I miss more than hit
With a face that was launched to sink
And I seldom feel the bright relief
It's been the worst day since yesterday

If there's one thing I have said
It's that the dreams I once had now lay in bed
As the four winds blow my wits through the door
It's been the worst day since yesterday

Falling down to you, sweet ground
Where the flowers they bloom, well, it's there I'll be found
Hurry back to me, my wild calling
It's been the worst day since yesterday

Though these wounds have seen no wars
Except for the scars I have ignored
And this endless crutch, well, it's never enough
It's been the worst day since yesterday

Hell says hello, well, it's time I should go
To pastures green that I've yet to see
Hurry back to me, my wild calling
It's been the worst day since yesterday

It's been the worst day since yesterday
