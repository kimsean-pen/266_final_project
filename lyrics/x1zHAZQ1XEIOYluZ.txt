Why
Do we subscribe
To a universal thread
That weaves the fabric of our lives
Ask why
Without batting an eye
We're so accepting
Question everything
Question everything you know

Fracture of doubt,
Crack to a chasm in an instant
Swallowing whole
The broken bones of our broken home
Into an ocean of disorder
But my view through the water's crystal clear,
And I've got something that you need to hear.

We don't know who we are, we wander never knowing
Feudal stone walls stop these oceans overflowing

Virtuosos wrote your thoughts in a symphony
Paradigms, transcribed
Under the supervision of conductors
To our dissonant chorus,
We orchestrate their composition,
They call it order

We don't know who we are, we reap what we are sewing
Fabric of our lives catches our eyes we abide unknowing

Wander,
Question
Find your
Obsession
knowledge
beckons
Find your
Obsession

We don't know who we are, we wander never knowing
We don't know who we are or why we are following
This script of reality
Where we become the casualty
Conditioned in
An intellectual prison
Fuck this system

Follow your intuition

Wander,
Question
Find your
Obsession
knowledge
beckons
Find your
Obsession

Question everything you know
