It must be your skin, I'm sinkin' in
It must be for real, 'cause now I can feel
And I didn't mind, it's not my kind
It's not my time, to wonder why

Everything gone white, everything's grey
Now you're here, now you're away
I don't want this, remember that
I'll never forget, where you're at

Don't let the days go by
Glycerine, glycerine

I'm never alone, I'm alone all the time
Are you at one, or do you lie
We live in a wheel, where everyone steals

But when we rise, it's like strawberry fields
If I treated you bad, you'd bruise my face
Couldn't love you more, you've got a beautiful taste

Don't let the days go by
Could have been easier on you
I couldn't change though I wanted to
Should have been easier by three

Our old friend fear and you and me
Glycerine, glycerine
Don't let the days go by, glycerine
Don't let the days go by
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Glycerine, glycerine
Oh, glycerine, glycerine

Bad moon whine again
Bad moon whine again
As she falls around me

I needed you more, we wanted us less
Could not kiss, just regress
It might just be me, simple, and plain
Well that's just fine, that's just one of my names

Don't let the days go by
Could've been easier on you you you
Glycerine, glycerine
Glycerine, glycerine
