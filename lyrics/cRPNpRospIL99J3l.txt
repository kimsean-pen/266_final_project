I know I may be young
But
I've got feelings too
And I need to do
What I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen

All you people look at me like I'm a little girl
Well did you ever think it'd be okay
For me to step into in this world
Always saying little girl don't step into the club
Well I'm just tryin' to find out why
'Cause dancing's what I love
(Now watch me)

Get it get it get it get it whoa
Get it get it (do you like it?)
Get it get it whoa
Get it get it get it get it whoa
(This feels good)

I know I may come off quiet
May come off shy
But I feel like talking feel like dancing
When I see this guy
What's practical is logical
What the hell who cares
All I know is I'm so happy
When you're dancing there

I'm a slave 4 U
I cannot hold it
I cannot control it
I'm a slave 4 U
I won't deny it
I'm not trying to hide it

Baby
Don't you wanna dance upon me?
(I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place
Oh, baby
Don't you wanna dance up on me?
(Are you ready?)
Leave behind my name and age

Let's go
Like that
You like it
Yeah
Now watch me

Get it get it get it get it whoa
Get it get it (do you like it?)
Get it get it whoa
Get it get it get it get it whoa

I really wanna dance tonight with you
(I just can't help myself)
I really wanna do what you want me to
(I just feel I let myself go)
I really wanna dance tonight with you
(I wanna see you move)
I really wanna do what you want me to
(Uh uh uh)

Baby
Don't you wanna dance up on me?

To another time and place

Leave behind my name and age
