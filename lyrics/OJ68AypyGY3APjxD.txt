Imagine seeing him on the town holding another hand
She's staring me down so I figure that he told her who I am
But it don't matter either way what they do or say
'Cause ain't nothing changed
He's standing with her but his soul is calling out my name

In my mind I'll always be his lady
In my mind I'll always be his girl

Saw his mama just the other said he'd been through a spell
Had a bad break up, thinks he's on his way up, it's hard to tell
She said? I think it'd do some good if you call him every now and then
You see he's been through some things
And I'm thinking he could really use a friend?

In my mind I'll always be his lady
In my mind I'll always be his girl
Only time will tell if I'm his lady
But in my mind I'll always be his girl

They say if you love something you've got to let it go
And if it comes back then it means so much more
But if it never does at least you will know
That it was something you had to go through to grow

In my mind I'll always be his lady
In my mind I'll always be his girl
Only time will tell if I'm his lady
But in my mind I'll always be his girl

Always feel this way about you
Always be a lady

In my mind, in my heart, in my soul
(In my mind, in my mind, in my mind)
Baby, you should know
You're in my thoughts, you're in my prayer
(In my mind, in my mind)
I'll always be your girl, say yeah
(In my mind)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
