Ten steps forwards
Twenty steps back
Hands over my cheeks
My head falls back
Skipping over every inch
Over every crack
I like to see sleepy people
Walking every step
Walking every step

Insomnia
I feel better with you
You're in my head

Insomnia
I feel better with you
You're in my head

Ten steps forwards
Twenty steps back
Hands over my cheeks
My head falls back
Skipping over every inch
Over every crack
I like to see sleepy people
Walking every step
Walking every step

Insomnia
I feel better with you
You're in my head

Insomnia
I feel better with you
I feel better with you

I feel better with you
I feel better with you
I feel better with you
I feel better with you

Insomnia
I feel better with you
You're in my head

Insomnia
I feel better with you

I feel better with you
I feel better with you
I feel better with you
I feel better with you
