I didn't ask for that
You give me heart attack
I didn't want to care
And then I saw you there
Been working like a dog
I turned all my dreams off
I didn't know my name
I didn't know my name

(I got a little bit longer) I got a ways to go
(I got a little bit longer) I got a ways to go
(Oh I got a little bit longer) I got a ways to go-oh-oh
Whoa oh oh (I got a ways to go)

Even when I can't see my rear view
Even if I call just to hear you
Even when I sleep all day
Even when I sleep all day
Even if I wasn't like I'm times two
Living in the back of a bunk just like we do
Even when I dream all day

Don't wanna sleep tonight
You've got me feeling right
I didn't know my name
I didn't know my name

(I got a little bit longer) I got a ways to go
(I got a little bit longer) I got a ways to go
(Oh I got a little bit longer) I got a ways to go-oh-oh
Whoa oh oh (I got a ways to go)

Even when I can't see my rear view
Even if I call just to hear you
Even when I sleep all day
Even when I sleep all day
Even if I wasn't like I'm times two
Living in the back of a bunk just like we do
Even when I dream all day
Even when I dream all day

(Oh I got a little bit longer) I got a ways to go-oh-oh
Whoa oh oh

Even if I smoke in the back room
Even if I go right to meet you
Even when I sleep all day
Even when I sleep all day
Even if I wasn't like I'm times two
Waiting for the day just to end so I see you
Even when I dream all day
Even when I dream all day
