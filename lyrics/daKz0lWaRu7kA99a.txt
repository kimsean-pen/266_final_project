The air is thick
And heavy to breath
The dust burns my throat
She stood in a doorway
As pale as someone already gone
No hellos no goodbyes

Premonitions in the rising wind
Tonight the stars will fall
The world in a cyclone, pouring out
No escape, but hey who cares
Just go with the flow

The sky is black
Like when the world ends, she said

The sky is black
In abandoned lands, which time has left
