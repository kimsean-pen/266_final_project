Try not to let the burn become a scar
What's left of me is only broken parts
You take the pretty and color it dark
My only grievance is a broken heart

When you finally find yourself
Tell him I said, Tell him I said
When you finally find yourself
Tell him I said, Tell him I said
Goodbye
Goodbye

You're riding paper airplanes
Can't see the string
You cover up the poison, with poetry
You traded roses and left me sorry
My only grievance is a broken dream

When you finally find yourself
Tell him I said, Tell him I said
When you finally find yourself
Tell him I said, Tell him I said
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Ooh-oh-ooh
Tell him I said, Tell him I said ooh-oh-ooh
Tell him I said, Tell him I said ooh-oh-ooh
Tell him I said, Tell him I said ooh-oh-ohh
Tell him I said, Tell him I said

When you finally find yourself (find yourself)
Tell him I said, Tell him I said
When you finally find yourself
Tell him I said, Tell him I said
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
