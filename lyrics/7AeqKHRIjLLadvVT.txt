Sanctus dominus
Infernus ad astra
Sanctus dominus
Infernus ad astra
Sanctus dominus
Infernus ad astra
Sanctus dominus
Infernus ad astra

Across the galaxy a new force of evil is rising
Wizards of Chaos fighting the throne of brave king of Dundee
Entwined by mystic spells, they know where the sorcerer hidden
Imprisoned in ice on the planet of knights, the powerful heroes of Crail

Eons of warfare returning
No longer peace will survive
The intergalactic great empire of Fife will die

For the king we will ride
To the dark galactic skies
To defeat the foes
When the Chaos Wizards rise
Now the universe will burn
Evil sorcerer returns
Tragic fate rages tonight
Chaos Wizards rise

Sanctus dominus
Infernus ad astra
Sanctus dominus
Infernus ad astra

Ten centuries ago brave heroes defeated the wizard
Now Chaos reigns and evil returns to the kingdom of Fife
Wizard cultists rage - on dark wings of steel they are flying
To space they must go, great terror they sow, nothing can stand in their way

The space knights of Crail are defeated
The fortress of Triton is lost
Zargothrax rises once more from his prison of frost

For the king we will ride
Through the dark galactic skies
To defeat the foes
When the Chaos Wizards rise
Now the universe will burn
Evil sorcerer returns
Tragic fate rages tonight
Chaos Wizards rise

And lo, after centuries of frozen slumber I am free once more
Cosmic infinity courses through my veins
My body is ablaze with astral charge
The galaxy shall once again tremble before the might of Zargothrax

For the king we will ride
Through the dark galactic skies
To defeat the foes
When the Chaos Wizards rise
Now the universe will burn
Evil sorcerer returns
Tragic fate rages tonight
Chaos Wizards rise

Rise
