I'll get my feelings out
I don't care where or how
I know I said begone
Well I'm searching for you now
Your feet, they never found
A firm hold on the ground
Your eyes are burning up
And I need to calm you down
I don't want you to the bone
I just need to lay down with soft skin clothes
To my own
The rattled stones had found
I stumbled to the ground
The houses up above
And the way you pin me down
I promise, lord, I can
Let me be my true love's man
I'll pack her up and run to a quiet seaside town
I don't want you to the bone
I just need to lay down with soft skin clothes
To my own
Until my true love's home
