Now one day I started telling everyone that
Killing is my business and I was hung like a martyr
For looking down the cross, my skull beneath the skin
Prophesied last rites, loved to death, my friends

Then I started seeing bad omens in my head
Good mourning, black Friday - will I wake up dead?
If I ain't superstitious, then this won't mean a thing
But some crazy shit has happened since the conjuring

Not even close
Not even close
Not even close
To overdose

Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory

Came anarchy to set the world a fire
Pain of hook in mouth in my darkest hour
Corruption of the world - peace sells, nobody's buying
Ignorant religion, holy wars and the dying

Tornado nearly got me by the skin o' my teeth
This was my life, foreclosure of my dreams
May the past rust in peace in hangar 18
And countdown to extinction just be a bad dream
Lucretia used to say

Not even close
Not even close
Not even close
To overdose

Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory

Not even close
Not even close
Not even close
To overdose

Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory

Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory
