They'll never walk away
They'll never walk away from you

They'll never run astray
They'll never run astray from you

This could be fantasy
Now that I'm everything that I'm supposed to be

Clover
I'll be in clover soon
I'll be in clover
I'll be in clover with you

They'll never walk away
They'll never run astray from you

This could be ecstasy
Now that I'm everything that I'm supposed to be

Clover
I'll be in clover with you
I'll be in clover
I'll be in clover with you
I'll be in clover
I'll be in clover soon
I'll be in clover
I'll be in clover with you

I'll be in clover
I'll be in clover with you
I'll be in clover
I'll be in clover with you
