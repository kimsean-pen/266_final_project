We head for land
We're pressed for time
We head for land
Request the time
I moved away
I know the way
I looked away...

Your eyes
My skin
Your pool
All in

I'm all ready
Dry ice
Dry eyes
Keep it low around here

Within without
Fall in fall out
Without within
Breathe out
I'm all wrapped in dry ice

Keep it low around here
