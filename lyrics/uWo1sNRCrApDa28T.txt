Put my best shoes on and meet mother in the kitchen
Following sister stomping plastic
Empty milk gallon graveyard, recycling rockstar
Soldiers of the lord

Stare out my window at the neighbours at night
Serpentine explanations for why I stayed out of sight
Rosemary Robinson, my stars and my sun
Hannah and I in the cemetery aisles overcome with belief
That everything we'd eat

Was good and clean
We'd spit our seeds
Gonna make this garden grow
Inch by inch and row by row
Row by row

Early winter morning, Mo puts on the coffee
Making records in my bedroom
Tin foil in the heat vents
Get high in the basement
Sing into my mouth

Perched on the counter in our shorts and our socks
Share a smoke on the sofa and blow a kiss to the cops
Here, help me move the kitchen table aside
Heaven Hill in the freezer for the bags stamped beneath our eyes Opened miles wide

And all we'd seen
Was gold and green
Gonna make this garden grow
Inch by inch and row by row
Row by row
