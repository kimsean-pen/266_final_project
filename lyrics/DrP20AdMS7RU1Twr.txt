White lights in the distance
Black lights when they close down
It's hard to disguise when you want them to find you
When you want them to...

When the vaults open and the rain falls
Washes away the tar
But it won't undo

Come back to me, come back...
Attached to the thought, impaired by the feeling
Nothing has carved as deep as you, deep as you
Come back, come back, come back to me once more
Come back, come back, come back to me once more

(Come back)
All isn't gold when it's sunny
(Come back)
It's hard seeing things when you know you can't have any
When you know you can't have any
Nothing has carved as deep as you, deep as you

Black lights, come back
Black lights, it's hard to disguise when you want them to...
When you want them to...
Black lights, really want you to...
Come back to me, come back
Black lights, it's hard to disguise
White lights, nothing has carved as deep as you, deep as you

(Come back)
All isn't gold when it's sunny
(Come back)
It's hard seeing things when you know you can't have any
When you know you can't have any
Nothing has carved as deep as you, deep as you
Black lights, come back
