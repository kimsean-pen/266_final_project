I got kicked off Noah's Ark
I turn my cheek to unkind remarks
there was two of everything
but one of me
and when the rains came tumbling down
I held my breath and I stood my ground
and I watched that ship go sailing
out to sea.

Chorus:
Take it back
take it back
oh no, you can't say that
all of my friends
are not dead or in jail
through rock and through stone
the black wind still moans
sweet revenge
sweet revenge
without fail.

I caught an aisle seat on a plane
and drove an English teacher half insane
making up jokes about bicycle spokes
and red balloons
so I called up my local deejay
and he didn't have a lot to say
but the radio
has learned all of my favorite tunes.

Chorus:

The white meat is on the run
and the dark meat is far too done
and the milkman left me a note yesterday
get out of this town by noon
you're coming on way too soon
and besides that
we never liked you any way.

Chorus:
