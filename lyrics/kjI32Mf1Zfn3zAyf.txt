Submerged in the depths
Wandering the abyss of my mind
Walking down the steps of my torch lit regret
Searching for truth in the past I left behind

In the absence of light
My eyes slowly adjust to the dark
Illuminated malignance in sight
Posthumous memoirs of a withered heart

I lay awake at night
Staring at the wall while I decay inside
All the pain and anxiety trapped inside my mind is slowly killing me

I found my way in darkness
Forsaken by the world that created me
A refuge of confinement desperately searching for my sanity
I can never be what they want me to be

In the absence of light
My eyes slowly adjust to the dark
Illuminated malignance in sight
Posthumous memoirs of a withered heart

Submerged in the depths
Wandering the abyss of my mind
Walking down the steps of my torch lit regret
Searching for truth

I've lost my mind
I'm sick
The world still calls me schizophrenic
They won't ever understand
Yea
I'm a byproduct of this society
I'm reminded constantly by my anxiety

Swallow the pills to sleep
Voices scream in my head
Sleep is for the dead
Swallow the pills to sleep
Voices scream in my head
Sleep is for the dead

I found my way in darkness
Forsaken by the world that created me
A refuge of confinement desperately searching for my sanity
I can never be what they want me to be

In the absence of light
My eyes slowly adjust to the dark
Illuminated malignance in sight
Posthumous memoirs of a withered heart
