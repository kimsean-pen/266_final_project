(Let's go!)

I was up in the club with my homies, trying to get a lil V-I
Keep it down on the low key
You should know how it feels (hey)
I seen shawty, she was checking up on me
From the game she was spittin' in my ear
You would think that she know me
I decided to chill (okay)
Conversation got heavy (hey)
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow (watch out)
Ohh! (watch out)
She's saying, "come get me" (come get me)
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, baby let's go
When I told her (let's go) I said

Yeah, yeah
Shawty got down on me and said, come and get me
Yeah, yeah
I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah, yeah
Her and my girl used to be the best of homies
Yeah, yeah
Next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

So she's all up in my head now
Got me thinkin' that it might a good idea to take her with me (with me)
Cause she's ready to leave
(Ready to leave)(ok let's go)
Now I gotta keep it real now
Cause on a one-to-ten she's a certified twenty...
But that just ain't me, hey!
Cause I don't know if I take that chance just where is it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance, makes shawty alright with me
The way she get low, I'm like yeah, just work that out for me
She asked for one more dance
And I'm like, Yeah, how the hell am I supposed to leave?
And I said...

Yeah, yeah
Shawty got down on me and said, come and get me
Yeah, yeah
I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah, yeah
Her and my girl used to be the best of homies
Yeah, yeah
Next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

(Hey, hey Luda!)
Watch out! My outfit's ridiculous
In the club lookin' so conspicuous
And rowl! These women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady I'm a milk the cow
Forget about game I'm a spit the truth
I won't stop till I get 'em in they birthday suits
So gimmie the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes (ah)
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cuttin' then I put em on foot patrol
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please
Ludacris fill cups like double D's
Me and Ursh once more and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say

Yeah, yeah
Shawty got down on me and said, come and get me
Yeah, yeah
I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah, yeah
Her and my girl used to be the best of homies
Yeah, yeah
Next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

Take that and rewind it back
Lil' Jon got the beat make ya booty go
