Feel the fear
N the air
But we don't a bait
Turn the doubts to a cloud
And watch it float away
Fight our battles
Cages rattle
Break a wall
Watch it fall
Take em' bruises
Not afraid to lose it all
We got the thunder
And we let it roar we let it roar
We like the fire
And we let it roar, we let it roar
let it roar
U see us comin' through the night
They're ain't no stoping
What we ignite
We like the fire
And we let it roar, we let it roar let it roar
Battle eyes on the prize
And were all takin in
Said the nail to the stone
And carve out our own names
Fight our battles
cages rattle
Break a wall
Watch it fall
Take em bruises
Not afraid to lose it all
We got the thunder
And we let it roar, we let it roar
We like the fire
And we let it roar, we let it roar, let it roar
U see us comin through the night
There ain't no stoping
What we ignite
We like the fire
And we let it roar, we let it roar, let it roar
We got thunder
We let it roar, we let it roar
We like the fire
And we let it roar, we let it roar let it roar
U see us comin through the night
There ain't no stoping
What we ignite
We like the fire
We let it roar let it roar let it roar
