Sittin' on the counter in your kitchen
Can you hear my heartbeat fucking kickin'?
Your eyes light up 'cause you best believe
That I got something on my sleeve
I walk my talk, no time for wishful thinking
I push up on my toes, you call me "sweet thing"
And breathin' down your neck, your body screaming
And you thought that you were the boss tonight
But I can put up one good fight
I flip the script like I can take a beating

And when you start to feel the rush
A crimson headache, aching blush
And you surrender to the touch, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is heaven in hiding, oh
And when you start to look at me, a physical fatality
And you surrender to the heat, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is heaven in hiding

This is heaven in hiding, oh

Sittin' on the concrete in your basement
But I don't have no time for conversation
Said this ain't what you usually do

And a girl like me is new for you
And I can tell you mean it cause you're shakin'

And when you start to feel the rush
A crimson headache, aching blush
And you surrender to the touch, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is heaven in hiding, oh
And when you start to look at me, a physical fatality
And you surrender to the heat, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show

Don't you see what you're finding?
This is heaven in hiding
This is heaven in hiding, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And when you start to feel the rush
A crimson headache, aching blush
And you surrender to the touch, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is heaven in hiding, oh
And when you start to look at me, a physical fatality
And you surrender to the heat, you'll know

I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is heaven in hiding
This is heaven in hiding
This is heaven in hiding, oh
Oh, this is heaven in hiding
This is heaven in hiding
'Cause I'm heaven in hiding
