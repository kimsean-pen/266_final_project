What is this, an evil church?
People deceived upon the Earth,
Sundays prayer has lost the truth,
Will we dare to live the truth?
What I see is a serpent hiss,
Congration makes the list,
Pass around your money plates
Gather' round to fill the date

Welcome to the church of lies
Doves will die,
A priest will cry,
Man will tithe
Welcome to the church of lies

Chalice of blood,
Waits to fill us,
Chalice of blood

Unfaithful priest an evil man,
Mark of death fills his hand,
Black and white turn to grey,
In blaspheme he will pray,
Deceived by religion he will see,
Run in panic you will flee,
Out of heaven he will fall,
Fame to riches says it all,

Welcome to the church of lies
Doves will die,
A priest will cry,
Man will tithe
Welcome to the church of lies

Chalice of blood,
Waits to fill us,
Chalice of blood

Talk in tongues out of mind,
Is this truth you will find?
The evil ways is lose control,
Satan's laugh will be your toll,
Church of god lives in sin,
Gathers up all of men,
Out of good we're still in fright,
We all must live to see the light

Chalice of blood,
Waits to fill us,
Chalice of blood
You're welcome to church of lies
