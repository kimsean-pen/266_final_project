When they are coming
Give us guidance
For they are calling
To erase the damned
Yet, after all they praise the coming
To erase the damned
They will return
Now let me take you to the other side
Turn off the light and let it grow

They will set it on fire
They come to fool us all

They are slaves to the Fire, you know

Their fire must grow
They have to feed it

We must believe in something
That I would call a miracle
The grail will break the final seal
We must believe in something
A miracle, a miracle machine
We just hide it secretly

No belief, no belief, no belief
Give us what we need

Betrayed by the Nine
I've learned to love the shadows
And now they're coming home
That's why I need you on the other side

And then we, we may carry another light
I summon from the inside, deeper insight

They don't belong here
Though they claim they're right
Let it grow

Turn off the light
Let reason grow

They will set it on fire
They come to fool us all

They are slaves to the Fire, you know

Their fire must grow
They have to feed it

We must believe in something
That I would call a miracle
The grail will break the final seal
We must believe in something
A miracle, a miracle machine
We just hide it secretly

For they are coming
Give us guidance
