A man walks out of his apartment
It is raining, he's got no umbrella
He starts running beneath the awnings
Trying to save his suit
Trying to save his suit
Trying to dry and to dry and to dry but no good

When he gets to the crowded subway platform
He takes off both of his shoes
He steps right into somebody's fat loogie
And everyone who sees him says, "Eww."
Everyone who sees him says, "Eww."

But he doesn't care
'Cause last night he got a visit from the
Ghost of Corporate Future
The ghost said, "Take off both your shoes
Whatever chances you get
Especially when they're wet."

He also said, "Imagine you go away
On a business trip one day
And when you come back home
Your children have grown
And you never made your wife moan
Your children have grown
And you never made your wife moan."

"And people make you nervous
You'd think the world is ending
And everybody's features have somehow started blending
And everything is plastic
And everyone's sarcastic
And all your food is frozen
It needs to be defrosted."

"You'd think the world was ending
You'd think the world was ending
You'd think the world was ending right now

You'd think the world was ending
You'd think the world was ending
You'd think the world was ending right now."

"Well maybe you should just drink a lot less coffee
And never ever watch the ten o'clock news
Maybe you should kiss someone nice
Or lick a rock, or both."

"Maybe you should cut your own hair
'Cause that can be so funny
It doesn't cost any money
And it always grows back
Hair grows even after you're dead."

"And people are just people
They shouldn't make you nervous
The world is everlasting
It's coming and it's going
If you don't toss your plastic
The streets won't be so plastic
And if you kiss somebody
Then both of you'll get practice."

"The world is everlasting
Put dirtballs in your pocket
Put dirtballs in your pocket
And take off both your shoes."

"'Cause people are just people
People are just people
People are just people like you

People are just people
People are just people
People are just people like you."

The world is everlasting
It's coming and it's going
The world is everlasting
It's coming and it's going
It's coming and it's going
