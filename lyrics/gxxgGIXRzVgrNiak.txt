Come and open me up
I don't know where I am
I don't know where anything is

Come and get me
The ripping open of me
Catapult me crying

Incision, inside her
Size her up
Where's my choice in the matter
I want what's mine
What the coat's hanging on

Anyway you slice it
Slice me open
I think we got it all wrong
Where do you
Where'd you get off

You feel alone
I know you feel alone
With me inside
You feel alone
With me inside of you
I only see what I want
What I want to see

Life is full of little surprises
Manageable
Catastrophe
Once you let go

Carried off
Carried away
Cursed
Curtailed
You catapult shit like wet autumn leaves
You catapult shit like wet autumn leaves

The fear alone
Of being alone
Never subsides
The fear alone of not living what others call lives
We only see what we want
What we want to see
And you've taken from me
Lied to about safety
Stolen from safe keeping

Don't feel alive
You don't feel alive

I know you feel alone
How far along am I
I know the fear alone
Existed well before the twinkle in your eyes
The world moans with no one to say goodnight
Now you're captured in time

Stolen from safety
Lied to about safe keeping
You think this is alive/a life

You know the outcome
Before it began
Can't stop it now
The avalanche
Let it fall
Bottom of the sea
Careen over the edge
As far as I can see

This is your only life
This is your only life
