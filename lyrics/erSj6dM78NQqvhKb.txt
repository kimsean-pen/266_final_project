Take, your chance for paradise
I'm looking in your eyes
Mine, be mine tonight
Yeah, I'm feeling like a fool
'Cause you still answer me:
Spend the night with me

I can lose my heart tonight
If you love me, feel allright
This is just the night for me and you
I can lose my heart tonight
By you lonely deep inside
There's something in the air tonight

I can feel it every where
There's magic in the air
Mine, be mine tonight
Yeah, I feel so hypnotized
I feel like paradise
I see heaven in your eyes

I can lose my heart tonight
If you love me, feel allright
This is just the night for me and you
I can lose my heart tonight
By you lonely deep inside
There's something in the air tonight

Take me in your arms
Hold me close tonight
Take my heart away
Take me to the night

I can lose my heart tonight
If you love me, feel allright
This is just the night for me and you
I can lose my heart tonight
By you lonely deep inside
There's something in the air tonight.
