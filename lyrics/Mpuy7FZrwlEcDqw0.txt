Faith Or Forgiveness

Three years, and counting, a long time for any endeavors.
Just get us away from here

I have something you should know, that this will never end,
And our legs will forever hold these scars.
There's something you should know, there's more to this story,
We'll never fade, and our arms will forever have these scars.

Set a course, through sand and storm.
Never fearful, and always hopeful.

I have something you should know, that this will never end,
And our legs will forever hold these scars.
There's something you should know, there's more to this story,
We'll never fade, and our arms will forever have these scars.

We'd pray to find our place. Take flight to eastern skies,
And when the winds change, we'll be blown back to here.

Bitter and betrayed, broken but never disbanded, we gave it our all.
I was jaded then, and maybe I still am, but will push on.

Missing but mended, some hearts never break.
The things inside us all, found only to be stronger than before.

(I have something you should know) I'll see you when the sun sets...
