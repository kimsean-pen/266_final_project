Never so complete just failing on its feet
Choking out these last few days here
Never ever lied all confidence at all times
Trying hard to love myself
I think that I need some working on so work on me
I think that nothing's getting through so get to me
Just another no show waste of passing go
Christ knows how we get to be here

No one's broken no one's beaten
I can see a rainbow near them
I can see a rainbow

Never so confused just laughed out cost abused
Aiming loosely your direction
Always too extreme all cause and case to plead
I think that I need some working on so work on me
I think that nothing's getting through so get to me
Just another no name taken passing blame
Christ knows how we get to be here[ch]

Always coming clean all case and cause to bleed
Trying hard to like yourself
Never so complete just falling on its feet
Choking out these last few breaths here
I think that I need some working on so work on me
I think that nothing's getting through so get to me
Just another no show scissors paper stone
Christ knows why we get to be here
