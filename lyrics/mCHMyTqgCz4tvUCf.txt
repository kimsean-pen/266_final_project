Shoulda stuck with me, kid
All the things I did
I spoke so clearly to you
What would you do if I just turned around and said
All your memories were never real?
How would you feel?

But how come every time you come around, I get deceived?
People, places, different faces, I just can't believe
Give me something to believe in
I'll just be grieving over you, yeah
And all that you do, my baby

It's just your language
That makes me wanna scream and shout
To God's ears from your mouth
Can I get a witness?
Do you know what I'm talking about?
(I want you to know it)
Sure enough, listen up

How come every time you come around, I get deceived?
People, places, different faces, I just can't believe
In the bed that I was sleeping
Dreams that weren't worth keeping for two kin
It's all that you do
Uh oh!

It's just your language
That makes me wanna scream and shout
To God's ears from your mouth
Can I get a witness?
Do you know what I'm talkin' about?
Do you know what I'm talkin' about?

It's just your language, baby
That makes me wanna scream and shout
Love to guide the wish from your mouth
Can I get a witness?
Do you know what I'm talkin' about?
Do you know, do you know, do you know?

I call you on the phone
Tell you you ain't actin' right
Don't wanna be alone
So, baby, what you doing tonight?
I call you on the phone
To tell you you ain't actin' right
You know I don't wanna be alone
Baby, what you doing tonight?
I call you on the phone
To tell you you ain't actin' right
Don't wanna be alone
So, baby, what you doing tonight?
I call you on the phone
To tell you you ain't actin' right
Don't wanna be alone
Baby

It makes me wanna scream and shout
To God's ears from your mouth
Can I get a witness?
Do you know what I'm?
Sugar do you know, yeah?
