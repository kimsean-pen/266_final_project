Where did you go today?
Must have been lost, the wayfarer strays, I
I don't know the words to say
So, "Nothing," I say, it's better that way, but

Baby please, I know, I know
So take me please, I'll go, I'll go

You've got me here, but you can't stay
There's nothing missing but you when you run away again
I'm asking but you just can't say
I thought that you had my back

You have been everywhere
Chasing away the day
Facing away, you made it okay to please go and never stay
But where did you go today?
Could've been anywhere
But I believe there's something here that you should take in

Baby please, I know, I know
So take me please, I'll go, I'll go

You brought me here, but you can't stay
There's nothing missing but you when you run away, girl
I'm asking what you just can't say, girl
I thought that you had my back, but you're not coming

You got me here, but you can't stay
There's nothing missing but you when you run away, girl
I'm asking what you just can't say, girl
I thought that you had my back, but you're not coming

You got me here, but you can't stay
There's nothing missing but you when you run away, girl
And all I'm asking what you just can't say, girl
I thought that you had my back

You got me here, but you can't stay
There's nothing missing but you when you run away, girl
And all I'm asking what you just can't say, girl
I thought that you had my back
