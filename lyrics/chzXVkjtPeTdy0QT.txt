You say you are right
I hope that I'm wrong
I know that you've tried
But still it is gone
Just don't you lose hope
I swear I'd never dreamed that we're alone
Now don't you let go
I swear I still believe though I don't know

Remember the years
I still walked tall
Now I only fear
Now I only crawl
How could I be wrong?
I hope there comes a day your fear is gone
How could we be lost?
Lost just cease to be and not carry on

Into the light may you fall
Into the light may you follow
Into the light may you know
Truth alone
Into the light may you fall
Into the light may you follow
Into the light may you know
Truth alone
Truth alone

You can love someone

Go, never to ask why
Or to fear again
Go, find your peace tonight
Go, set out towards the sun
Let the new begin
Go, soon your day will come
Your day will come

Into the light may you fall
Into the light may you follow
Into the light may you know
Truth alone
Into the light may you fall
Into the light may you follow
Into the light may you know
Truth alone
Truth alone
Truth alone
Truth alone
Truth alone
