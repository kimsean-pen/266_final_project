What'd ya go and do that for?
I see the way you're looking at me
And i don't know why
I don't know and I'm not sure
Have you lost your way
Did you lose your mind
Are you out of time

You say Good-bye
Like everything's alright
You say Good-bye

Like everything's alright

If we go on
Its now or never
If we go on
If we go on
Its now or never
If we go on

What'd ya go and do that for
I'm telling you
So tell me
Whats it gonna be
I don't know and I'm not sure
But sooner or later I wanna believe
I wanna believe

You say Good-bye
Like everything's alright
You say Good-bye
Like everything's alright

If we go on
Its now or never
If we go on
If we go on
Its now or never
If we go on
Its now or never

It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never

Oh oh oh oh

You say Good-bye
Like everythings alright
You say Good-bye
Like everythings alright

If we go on
Its now or never
If we go on
If we go on
Its now or never
If we go on

You're waiting to hold my hand
Its now or never again

If we go on,
Its now or never
If we go on
You're waiting to hold my hand
It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never
