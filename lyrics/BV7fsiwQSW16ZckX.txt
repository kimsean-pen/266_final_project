You're so clear to me
I can see right through you
When you look at me
You're somewhere else
And all we know is all we've got
Stillness in your fades
Heart wont stop

And I never satisified you, no
No, you're the one

If I was your ex-
Girlfriend
Call you on the telephone
Ask you when you're coming home
If I was your ex-
Girlfriend
Tell you what was on my mind
We could leave it all behind

I won't shed a tear
Cause waterworks are easy
Left some things behind
Don't need your help
And all I know is all I've got
Is it hard to face
All we lost?

And I never satisified you, no
No, you're the one

So I'm, So I'm gonna let your body go for sure

I needed an answer
Sending you a message
I should have know better
You never satisfied your love

You don't even see me
Are you even breathing?
I should have known better
So I'm gonna let your body go for sure
