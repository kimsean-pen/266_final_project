Go
You won't go
If you leave me now
I can heal somehow

Back, to a time
When I knew myself
When I knew myself

Give me a reason why you choose to always hurt my soul
I gave you everything
Oh baby, please I have to know
Just answer me the question: are you going to stay or go?
Stay or go?

Oh, no. Please don't go
If you leave me now,
if you leave me now
Won't you stay
If you leave me now,
if you leave me now

Won't you stay

Back, to a time
But I know you won't
But I know you won't

Give me a reason why you choose to always hurt my soul
I gave you everything
Oh baby, please I have to know
Just answer me the question: are you going to stay or go?
Stay or go?

Oh, no. Please don't go
If you leave me now,
if you leave me now.
Won't you stay
If you leave me now,
if you leave me now.

Won't you stay?
If you leave me now

Won't you stay?
If you leave me now,
if you leave me now

Won't you stay?
Please don't go
If you leave me now
If you leave me now
