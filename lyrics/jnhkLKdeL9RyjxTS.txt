People who matter don't mind
They don't need all of my time
Somebody told me to light up every room
Make them remember you
But nobody here knows what I'm going through
No they never do

I miss my old friends
'Cause they know when I need them the most
I made some new friends and they cool friends
But they don't know
What I do, what I got, who I am and who I'm not
I miss my old friends
I miss my old friends

They know, they know
They know, they know
They know, they know
They know, they know

I miss the good times we had
Now I don't know who's got my back
Somebody told me to light up every room
Make them remember you
Nobody here knows what I'm going through
No they never do

I miss my old friends
'Cause they know when I need them the most
I made some new friends and they cool friends
But they don't know
What I do, what I got, who I am and who I'm not
I miss my old friends
I miss my old friends

They know, they know
They know, they know
They know, they know
They know, they know

I miss my old friends
When I need them the most
I miss my old friends
I miss my old friends
'Cause they know when I need them the most
I made some new friends and they cool friends
But they don't know
What I do, what I got, who I am and who I'm not
I miss my old friends
I miss my old friends

They know, they know
They know, they know
They know, they know
They know, they know

I miss my old friends
