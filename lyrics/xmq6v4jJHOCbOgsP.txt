Rub my wounds this is not life
Been dreaming I could be your wife 'Cause, oh, we've come too far
To live this alone would be a crime

And I won't say no
And I can't let go
(They say we can't go on)
'Cause the days that you laugh are the days that forever I'll keep
But, the problem stands
We're too young
(They say we are too young)
And the days they will pass,
But, I'll wait for you endlessly

I'm the neck that can't hold water You're the atlas lead me further 'Cause, oh, we've come too far
To live this alone would be a crime And I won't say no
And I can't let go
(They say we can't go on)
'Cause, the days that you laugh are the days that forever I'll keep
But, the problem stands
We're too young
(They say we are too young)
And the days they will pass
But, I'll wait for you endlessly

Cause you gave shelter
Safe at last, hold me tight
Oh, we've come too far
To live this alone would be a crime And I won't say no
And I can't let go
(They say we can't go on)
'Cause the days that you laugh are the days that forever I'll keep
But, the problem stands
We're too young
(They say we are too young)
And the days they will pass
But, I'll wait for you endlessly
And the days they will pass
But, I'll wait for you endlessly
