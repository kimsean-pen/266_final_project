Watch me as I'm getting up
And see me shaking up the dust
'Cause I'm starting again
Didn't think that i could
I didn't think. So did you?
I cover up the scars of love
I dry my tears I've got pride enough
And I know as it ends
That I wouldn't undo
Anything we've been through

'Cause I see to fly you need to fall
And now I'm wonder why
To better stop we're lost
Now don't matter
I won't blame the world
'Cause everytime it hurts
When I went through the worst
I came out better
better, better, better, better
I came out better

Watch me as I'm letting go
Everything I used to know
And I'll never look back, didn't think that i could
Didn't think so did you
Memory stuck on repeat
Stopping now as I set them free
And I know as it ends
That all wouldn't undo
Anything we've been through

'Cause I see to fly you need to fall
And now I'm wonder why
To better stop we're lost
Now don't matter
I won't blame the world
'Cause everytime it hurts
When i went through the worst
I came out better
better, better, better, better
I came out better
