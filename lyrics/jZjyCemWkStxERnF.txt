Ooh ooh
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

What is love? 'Cos baby, I don't know
I got a funny feeling in my heart
If this is love, it feels like butterflies
So tell me, baby, is this how it starts?

I know, I've never felt like this before
You're like a drug, you got me wanting more
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know

You're, you're my number one
I do anything for you
Catch the rain from the sky
Even hold back the tide for you

For you, baby

You're, you're my number one
With you, I know I belong
I put the radio on
And it's always playing our song

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

Tell me what, what have I gotta do?
'Cos I wanna lay a claim on you
To make you mine, for now and for all time
So tell me, baby, what I gotta do? Yeah

I know I've never felt like this before
You're like a drug, you got me wanting more
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know

You're, you're my number one
I do anything for you
Catch the rain from the sky
Even hold back the tide for you

Baby, baby

You're, you're my number one
With you, I know I belong
I put the radio on
And it's always playin' our song, yeah

There ain't nothin', I won't do, hey
I walk on water just to be with you, ooh

Baby, baby

You're, you're, you're my number one
Catch the rain from the sky
Even hold back the tide for you

Baby, baby

You're, you're, you're my number one
I put the radio on
And it's always playing our song, yea

You're my number one, ohh, ooh
You're, you're, you're my number one
