I caught a moment
And it caught me
Floating together, under the trees
We were sippin' on moonlight
Drinking champagne
A couple freaks in the purple rain

Some mistakes are worth making
Sometimes the time is worth wasting
Some heartbreaks are worth braving
I know, you know, you know

I just wanna get closer
Closer to your body than somebody else
I just wanna get closer
Closer to your body than nobody else

Four in the morning
She wants to dance
Twirling the nighttime in her hands
We've got candy and kisses
Keeping us high
Until we make it to paradise, sing

Some mistakes are worth making
Sometimes the time is worth wasting
Some heartbreaks are worth braving
I know, you know, you know

I just wanna get closer
Closer to your body than somebody else
I just wanna get closer
Closer to your body than nobody else
I just wanna get closer

The road to nowhere
Foot on the gas
The sun is watching
Having a laugh
So won't you hold me like the sky holds blue
And I'll keep singing this song for you

I just wanna get closer (closer)
Closer to your body than somebody else
I just wanna get closer (closer)
Closer to your body than nobody else
I just wanna get closer
