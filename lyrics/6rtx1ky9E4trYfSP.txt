caught off guard
all worked up
the air is as dark
and cold as night

let me go
i'm not done
I swear i'll take
just one life time

And I, I won't lie
I won't sin
maybe I don't wanna go
can't you wait?

maybe I don't wanna go
I should've asked*
I could've helped*
at least a fucking

1, 000 times before
will this offer get me in
or does this prove
that they gave more

And I, I won't lie
I won't sin
maybe I don't wanna go
can't you wait?

maybe I don't wanna go
(Bridge)
And I, I won't lie
I won't sin
maybe I don't wanna go
can't you wait?
maybe I don't wanna go
And I, I won't lie
I won't sin
maybe I don't wanna go
can't you wait?
maybe I don't wanna go
