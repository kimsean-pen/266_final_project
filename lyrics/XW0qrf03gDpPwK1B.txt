Baby, I was hypnotised when I looked into your eyes
Saw the love I'd been waiting for
Couldn't help but fantasise 'bout a world where you and I
Stay together for evermore

Don't hesitate
'Cause I can't control my feelings
Just can't wait
Now I know where this is leading

Baby, please
This heart's on the line
Don't waste this precious time
Say you'll be mine
It's not hard to do
Just tell me you feel it too
Baby, it's time
Say you'll be mine
(Say you'll be mine)

Took a spark to start the fire, fan the flame of my desire (my desire)
Turn the light on my destiny
And it took me by surprise all the love I felt inside (felt
Now I know it was meant to be

And step by step
I can feel how close we're getting
Can't stop yet
'Cause I know where this is heading

Baby, please (baby please)
This heart's on the line
Don't waste this precious time (don't waste it)
Say you'll be mine (say you'll be mine)
It's not hard to do (not hard to do)
Just tell me you feel it too (feel it too)
Baby, it's time (it's time)
Say you'll be mine
(Say you'll be mine)
Baby, it's time (it's time)
Say you'll be mine

Say it
(All you gotta do is say it)
Just say it
(You're the one I've been waiting for)
Say it
(All you gotta do is say it)
Just say it
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Baby, please
This heart's on the line
Don't waste this precious time
Say you'll be mine
It's not hard to do (not hard to do)
Just tell me you feel it too (feel it too)
Baby, it's time (come on)
Say you'll be mine
(Say you'll be mine)

Say, say you'll be mine
(Say you'll be mine)
Say, say you'll be mine
(Say you'll be mine)
Say, say you'll be mine (be mine)
Baby, it's time
Say you'll be mine
(Say you'll be mine)

Baby, please (baby please)
This heart's on the line
Don't waste this precious time (don't waste it)
Say you'll be mine (say you'll be mine)
It's not hard to do (not hard to do)
Just tell me you feel it too (feel it too)
Baby, it's time (it's time)
Say you'll be mine
(Say you'll be mine)
Baby, it's time
Say you'll be mine
