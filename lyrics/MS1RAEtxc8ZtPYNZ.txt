Leaning by the window watch the dying of the sun
Balancing the weight of the pill on her tongue
She'll be getting that
Look in her eyes
Cold and lonely
But I don't know why

See her near the border
At the end of the line
She falls down and I can't do enough
But I won't ever let her give up
The angel and the fool

Round and round, keep running
Round and round, keep running
Round and round, keep running
Running out, keep running out

She found herself in a well full of men
Watching her slowly destroy all her plans
Cause all along she won't allow herself to even dream about
The both of us enrolled in now
And it won't be long

The early morning sun
Is coming all around
Because waking up is hard enough when there's no one else around

See her near the border
At the end of the line
She falls down and I can't do enough
But I won't ever let her give up
The angel and the fool

Round and round, keep running
Round and round, keep running
Round and round, keep running
Running out, keep running out
