Here you can be anything
Anything that scares you
I think that scares you
Here, I've been here before
But only by myself, myself

I promised I'd see it again
I promised I'd see this with you now

I promised I'd see it again
I promised I'd see this with you now

What given up gives you
And where giving up takes you
I've have and I've been
Here in center frame
Here there's only air
And just enough space to fit

I promised I'd see it again
I promised I'd see this with you now

I promised I'd see it again
I promised I'd see this with you now

I said, said, said it out loud over and over
Said, said, said it out loud but what do I know
Said, said, said it out loud over and over

I said, said, said it out loud over and over
Said, said, said it out loud but it did not help
I'll stop now just so I can hear you
I stay up as late as it takes

I promised I'd see it again
I promised I'd see this with you now

I promised I'd see it again
I promised I'd see this with you now

I said, said, said it out loud over and over
Said, said, said it out loud but it did not help
I'll stop now just enough so I can hear you
I stay up as late as it takes

I stay up as late as it takes
I stay up as late as it takes

As long as it takes
As long as it takes
As long as it takes

I stay up as late as it takes
As long it takes
