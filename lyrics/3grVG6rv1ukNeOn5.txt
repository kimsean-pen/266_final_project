I'm a wind-up toy in an up-down world
If you leave me all alone I'll make a mess for sure
I've a heart of gold in the smallest size
Leave me in the dark, you never hear me cry

More than an illustration
Points of articulation
Come to life on a brass spring
Such a wonderful plaything

It's a cruel cross that I have to bear
If you come a little close I'm going to pull your hair
More than just a toy in a patched blue suit
Hold me in your arms, I'm just a boy like you

But your momma thought there was something wrong
Didn't want you sleeping with a boy too long
It's a serious thing in a grown-up world
Maybe you'd be better with a Barbie girl

You knew that I adored ya
But you left me in Georgia
Toys are not sentimental
How could I be for rental?

She's the meanest hag that has ever been
Pulled out my insides with an old safety pin
I'm the sorest sight, now I feel like trash
Clothes made of rags and they don't even match

So she dressed me up as the man she loved
And threw me in a box when she had had enough
Now the light of day I no longer see
She stuck her voodoo pins where my eyes used to be

Accidentally tragic
Victim of her black magic
I had a boy once who loved me
Now he's so afraid of me

On a long lost day, when you're grey and old
You'll be there remembering your old toy boy
When your only son's wondering what to be
Tell him the story of a boy like me
