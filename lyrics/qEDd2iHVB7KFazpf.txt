I see the future when I wake up
And it's, brighter, as we're falling down
And I'm feeling like I'm pacing
We'll sleep forever in the sands that we bathed in

Ooh Oooh
Ooh Oooh
Ooh Oooh
Ooh Oooh

It's not fair when I'm falling down
I wanna feel with you
Where the wind blows from the tidal wave
We'll sleep forever in the sands that we bathed in

Ooh Oooh
Ooh Oooh
Ooh Oooh
Ooh Oooh

Cuz every summer when I wake up
I wanna wake up with you
Alone together we're pacing

And every summer when I'll wake up
I'll feel closer to you
This love we can't replace it

Cuz every summer when I wake up
I wanna wake up with you
Alone together we're pacing

And every summer when I'll wake up
I'll feel closer to you
This love we can't replace it

It's not fair when I'm falling down
I wanna feel with you
Where the wind blows from the tidal wave
We'll sleep forever in the sands that we bathed in

It's not fair when I'm falling down
I wanna feel with you
Where the wind blows from the tidal wave
We'll sleep forever in the sands that we bathed in

Ooh Oooh
Ooh Oooh
Ooh Oooh

We'll sleep forever in the sands that we bathed in

Cuz every summer when I wake up
I wanna wake up with you
Alone together we're pacing

And every summer when I'll wake up
I'll feel closer to you
This love we can't replace it

Cuz every summer when I wake up
I wanna wake up with you
Alone together we're pacing

And every summer when I'll wake up
I'll feel closer to you
This love we can't replace it
