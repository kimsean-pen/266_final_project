And so the sky becomes a dream
I never dreamt, because I'm just too busy
Waiting for nothing and wasting away

Don't tell me it's too hard
You were never there from the start
I'm not about to give this up
Giving up was never enough, no

And so the sky becomes a dream
I never dreamt, because I'm just too busy
Waiting for nothing and wasting away

And so the sky, it watched my dreams
Fall to pieces right in front of me
'Cause I'm just too busy
Waiting for nothing and wasting away

And I never wished for anything more
Than to find what I've been looking for
And I swore to myself, I wouldn't lie to myself
How could I let this happen?
So I pull myself aside
Take the time you tell myself it's all right
'Cause you weren't there to dry my eyes

And so the sky becomes a dream
I never dreamt, because I'm just too busy
Waiting for nothing and wasting away

And so the sky, it watched my dreams
Fall to pieces right in front of me
'Cause I'm just too busy
Waiting for nothing and wasting away

I'm wasting, wasting away
I'm wasting, I'm wasting away

And so the sky becomes a dream
I never dreamt, because I'm just too busy
Waiting for nothing and wasting away

And so the sky becomes a dream
I never dreamt, because I'm just too busy
Waiting for nothing and wasting away

And so the sky it watched my dreams
Fall to pieces right in front of me
'Cause I'm just too busy
Waiting for nothing and wasting away
Wasting, wasting away, away
