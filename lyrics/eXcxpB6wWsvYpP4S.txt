This paint has been tasting of lead
And the chips will fall as they may
But it's not just my finish that's peeling
And it's not alone fleeing these walls

Well sooner or later this cold
It's gonna break, so our hands'll be warm again
But all I want is not to need you now
And sooner or later this code
It's gonna break and our words will be heard again
But all I want are vows of silence now

This turpentine chaser's got kick
And the rag that it's soaked in is rich
The fumes aid the pace of my cleaning
And as soon as I'm done I am gone

Well sooner or later this cold
It's gonna break, so our hands'll be warm again
But all I want is not to need you now
And sooner or later this code
It's gonna break and our words will be heard again
But all I want are vows of silence now

And the frightening facts
We've been facing our backs
To for so long now
Are begging for eyes to bear witness
To lies and indifference
Now we're saying aloud
The things we've declared in our silence
That new coats of paint
Will not reacquaint
Broken hearts to broken homes
Broken homes
