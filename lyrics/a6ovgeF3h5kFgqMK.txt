In my skin I feel like I can't be myself
Would you like me more If I was someone else
Through the glass I see someone that looks like me
Mirrors always show what you don't want to see

Can you fix me now
I don't know how

Can you fix me now
I don't know how

Can you fix me now
I don't know how

Can you fix me now
I don't know how

In my head I know these feelings can't be right
I feel I'm too weak I'll never win the fight
Through your eyes I see someone that feels malformed
Please sew shut my eyes so that I'll see no more

Can you fix me now
I don't know how

Can you fix me now
I don't know how

Can you fix me now
I don't know how

Can you fix me now
I don't know how

Can you fix me now
I don't know how

Can you fix me now
I don't know how

Can you fix me now
I don't know how

Can you fix me now
I don't know how
