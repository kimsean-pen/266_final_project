Such a pretty face
You see her walking around
In the middle of the night
In her wedding gown
Says that she can do it but is she trying?

Beautiful girl
Hasn't grown up yet
And she's wasting all her feelings on
A boy she's never met
Says that she is happy but is she lying?

Running and she's running again
She's trying to understand but she can't
Running and she's running again
She's crying by herself cause she can

Do you know her?
The girl that looks to you
And would you love her
The way that she loved you?

Such a pretty face
You see her walking around
It's the middle of the night
And nobody makes a sound
Says that she can do it but is she lying?

Running and she's running again
She's trying to understand but she can't
Running and she's running again
She's crying by herself cause she can

Do you know her?
The girl that looks to you
And would you love her?
The way that she loved you

And would you be there?
To help her push on through
And would you know her?
If she didn't know you

Are we enough
Do we measure up?
Are we enough
Do we measure up?

Such a pretty face
You see her walking around
Oh she's such a pretty face

Do you know her?
The girl that looks to you
And would you love her
The way that she loved you?
And would you be there?
To help her push on through
And would you know her?
If she didn't know you
