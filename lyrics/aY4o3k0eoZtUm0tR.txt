Are you asking for me still?
See through... i get lost again
and you walk, strangers...
you cant have it all.
And in a way im never gonna die
and the sun reaches in his sky
No, its alright, i cant go home again
just like before
You'd better get it before it goes
Son, you beter get it before it goes
And when the cold comes in
