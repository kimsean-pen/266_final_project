How long can we live this way?
How long 'till the rain starts coming down?
Everyone here's been wondering
When will it be over?

I hear the night train every evening
Maybe change is coming soon
With the harvest moon

Take me down to the river
Take me to the preacher-man
I can't wait any longer
I messed up all I can

I hear the night train singing in the distance
Maybe the angels are coming soon
With the harvest moon

If the river's rising
Look to the dark horizon
For the harvest moon, yeah

Wait a minute, just a little bit longer
It's all up to me and you

Wait a minute, just a little bit longer
It's all up to me and you

Wait a minute, just a little bit longer
It's all up to me and you
