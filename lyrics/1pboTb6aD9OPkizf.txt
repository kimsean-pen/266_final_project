In a little time so much has changed
Here I am again in that familiar place
Dreams may try to grow in the dark
But no fire can burn without the setting of a spark

I just want to give to you
All that you have given me
My searching heart
Cries for this
This thing I can't grasp
A love somewhere within

Given to roam
In a vast and empty space
A tiny glimpse of truth
Wrung from a simple twist of fate
Help me to find a new way to tread
So I might not be alone on the path that lies ahead

Try to forget the past
But nothing ever changes
Try to understand
But nothing ever changes
Try to lose myself
But nothing ever changes
Try to love myself
But nothing ever changes

Behind the eyes lies a truth
SO deeply concealed
Somewhere inside is a place
Where the weary rest and heal
Anger, fear, and regret keep the darkness at hand
But these feelings are real
All I ask, won't you please understand
