And no money, no money, no money, no money, no money can buy good name
I have a good name; I have a good name
And no money, no money, no money, no money, no money can buy my name
Do you have a good name; do you have a good name?
Then no money, no money, no money,
no money, no money should buy your name
I mean what I am saying
And no money, no money, no money, no money, no money can buy good name

Good name is better than silver and gold
And no money, no money, no money, no money, no money can buy good name

I mean what I am saying
That no money, no money, no money,
no money, no money can buy good name
Good name is better than silver and gold
And no money, no money, no money, no money, no money can buy good name
Do you have your conscience; do you have your conscience?
Then no money, no money, no money,
no money, no money should buy your name
I have my conscience; I have my conscience

And no money, no money, no money, no money, no money can buy my name
Good name is better than silver and gold
And no money, no money, no money, no money, no money can buy good name

Good name is better than silver and gold
