The rebirth of intelligent life will restore this planet's cosmic status.
As the surface draws into focus, every variance and nuance realized.

The simple birth.

Time is moving forward.
Elapse. Evolve. Expand. Adapt.
Adaptation runs parallel with surviving global conflict.

Sustained permanence proves imperfect existence, integrated.
Balance is reached between the parent star.

Endless motion.
Now the experience is long gone.

We won't forget it's entrancing stare, as long as we recall it's grip.

Stellar forces are keeping us alive.
