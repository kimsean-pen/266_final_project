Dead I drift amongst the stars
Lost in the astral wake of times
Limitless as I may seem
Endless memories haunt my dreams
Where is the part where close my eyes for good
I denounce this fucking life
Let me close my eyes for good

I can't believe I swore my soul to the dark force unknown
If I could take it back today
I'd slice upon my fucking throat if that's what I had to give
Is this destiny, is this destiny
My tongue has gotten the fucking best of me
I pray for a chance to be one with the universe
I wish to become one with darkness

One with the darkness one with the universe
One with the darkness, in the heart of the universe
Eternal

Dead I drift amongst the stars
Lost in the astral wake of times
Limitless as I may seem
Endless memories haunt my dreams
Where is the part where close my eyes for good
I denounce this fucking life
Let me close my eyes for good

In the shadow of the light
A microscopic cosmic blight
Bearer of humanity
Traveler of realities

Wandering beneath the seams
A ghost to the universe
Transcending realities

One with the darkness one with the universe
One with the darkness in the heart of the universe
Eternal

In the shadow of the ever growing light

I can't believe I swore my soul to the dark force unknown
If I could take it back today
I'd slice upon my fucking throat if that's what I had to give
Is this destiny, is this destiny
My tongue has gotten the fucking best of me
I pray for a chance to be one with the universe
I wish to become one with darkness
One with the darkness I wish to become one with the darkness
Where is the part where I close my eyes for good
I denounce with fucking life
Let me close my eyes for good
