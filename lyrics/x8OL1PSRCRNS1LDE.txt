I bet that one girl better for me
I bet that one girl better for me
I bet that one girl better for me,
Better for me, better for me
I bet that one girl better for me
I bet that one girl better for me
I bet that one girl better for me
You the one girl better for me

Hit me up on the low
Don't you stop when we go
Keep me on tippy toes now
You love that thing when it poke out
You see when I'm walking away
You fiend and you want me to stay
Let's leave, get away for the day
Top floor reservation

We can get comfortable
I get you comfortable
I show you something
Twist up that antidote
Show me that animal
Go 'head and give it all to me baby

No one in the world
No one in the world
No one in the world
Can love you better, better
Than I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I (no one in the world)
I, I, I, I
They try-y-y-y
But I am better, better

I bet that one girl better for me
I bet that one girl better for me
I bet that one girl better for me
(Better, better)

You had my body hot from the first kiss
You gotta keep it simple baby, nurse it
Then go a little deeper than the surface
So you can hurt this on purpose
Tell me how it fit, how it feel
Tell me if I grip you well
Tell me what you want, Dru hill
Tell me what you want

We can get comfortable
I get you comfortable
I show you something
Twist up that antidote
Show me that animal
Go 'head and give it all to me baby

No one in the world
No one in the world
No one in the world
Can love you better, better
Than I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
(No one in the world)
I, I, I, I
They try-y-y-y
But I am better, better

I bet that one girl better for me
No one loves you better, better
I bet that one girl better for me
No one loves you better, better
I bet that one girl better for me

I bet that one girl better for me
I bet that one girl better for me
I bet that one girl better for me,
Better for me, better for me
I bet that one girl better for me
I bet that one girl better for me
I bet that one girl better for me
You the one girl better for me

No one in the world
No one in the world
No one in the world
Can love you better, better
Than I, I, I, I
(No one in the world)
I, I, I, I
(No one in the world)
I, I, I, I
They try-y-y-y
(No on in the world)
But I am
(Can love you)
Better, better
I, I, I, I
(No one in the world)
I, I, I, I
(No one in the world)
I, I, I, I
They try-y-y-y
(No on in the world)
But I am
(Can love you)
Better, better

I bet that one girl better for me
I bet that one girl better for me
I bet that one girl better for me
Better, better
I bet that one girl better for me
I bet that one girl better for me
I bet that one girl better for me
