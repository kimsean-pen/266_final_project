You lit your silver spoon on fire.
The night you gave way to desire
And I'm trying to give you everything you want
And I'm trying to be everything you won't

The morning is mourning the days of our old love
And the clouds are crying over days that are all gone
And your patience is thinning and I'm looking for a smile
Or a touch or some tenderness that will keep on the ground

Cause I am here and nowhere else and you are all I want
Cause I am here and nowhere else and you are all I want
Cause I am here and nowhere else and you are all I want

September, remembrance of all that we have lost
But I'm trying forgiveness for the times that you took off
And I'm looking for newness in the way you say my name
And I guess that I'm asking you to try and do the same

Cause you are here and I am here and you are all I want
Cause you are here and I am here and you are in my heart
Cause I am here and nowhere else and you are in my heart
Cause you are here and I am here and you are all I want.
