Hey you, what is this all about?
You're up in my house, trying to run off the mouth, yeah
What now, did you forget my name?
You think this is a game, till I'm up in your face
Alright, I've graduated to ...the hitlist
Take a minute to collect yourself
Lord know you ain't ready for this here
You didn't really think this up so well
Take a trip on your tongue
Well if you really want some

Anytime, anyplace
Anytime and I'll be waiting
Name the time and place
Anytime and I'll be waiting
Come on, with one hand blazing
Come on, with one Hand cold
Anytime, anyplace
Anytime and I'll be waiting

Be careful what you choose cause it's me and you
Alright, I've graduated to ...The hitlist
Take a minute to collect yourself
