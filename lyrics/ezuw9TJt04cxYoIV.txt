Everythin', everythin'
Everythin', everythin'
Everythin', everythin'

I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm invisible, I'm invisible

An eraser of love, an eraser of love
An eraser of love, an eraser of love
An eraser of love, an eraser of love
An eraser of love, an eraser of love

Why don't you call me?
I feel like flyin' too
Why don't you call me?
I feel like flyin' too

Why don't you call me?
I feel like flyin' too
Why don't you call me?
I feel like flyin' too

I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm invisible, I'm invisible

An eraser of love, an eraser of love
An eraser of love, an eraser of love
An eraser of love, an eraser of love
An eraser of love, an eraser of love

An eraser of love, an eraser of love
An eraser of love, an eraser of love
An eraser of love, an eraser of love
An eraser of love, an eraser of love

Why don't you call me?
I feel like flyin' too
Why don't you call me?
I feel like flyin' too

Why don't you call me?
I feel like flyin' too
Why don't you call me?
I feel like flyin' too

An eraser of love, an eraser of love
An eraser of love, an eraser of love
An eraser of love, an eraser of love
An eraser of love, an eraser of love

I scream, I scream
I scream so much
You know what I mean
This electric stream

And my tears in league
With the wires and energy
And my machine
This is my beautiful dream

I'm hurtin' no one
Hurtin' no one
Hurtin' no one
Hurtin' no one

I wanna give you everythin'
I wanna give you energy
I wanna give a good thin'
I wanna give you everythin'

Everythin', everythin'
Everythin', everythin'
Everythin', everythin'
Everythin', everythin'
Everythin', everythin'

In one final scream of love
Who couldn't climb this high
She looks beautiful
Like a child

I feel tears, and I wanna scream
You know what I mean
This is hurtin' no one
An eraser of love

Hurt, the necessary feelin'

Why don't you call me?
I feel like flyin' too
Why don't you call me?
I feel like flyin' too

Why don't you call me?
I feel like flyin' too
Why don't you call me?
I feel like flyin' too

An eraser of love, an eraser of love
An eraser of love, an eraser of love
An eraser of love, an eraser of love
An eraser of love, an eraser of love
