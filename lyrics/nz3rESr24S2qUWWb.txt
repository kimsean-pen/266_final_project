Tonight I'm gonna sit with you
While all of the lines are blurring
Tonight I'm gonna fit with you
While the L.A. skies are burning
When I get afraid, I shut down
Look for a way to run around the truth
Baby, tonight I'm gonna be with you
Gonna show you a side you never knew

Got your eyes on a deeper love
But you can't be scared of the dark
You gotta wait up long enough

'Cause you'll only really see me when the sun goes down
You'll only really know me when I fall apart
Tonight we're gonna lie under the black sky, black sky
Baby, we ain't moving 'til the stars come out

'Til the stars come out (hey)
'Til the stars come out (hey)
'Til the stars come out (hey)
'Til the stars come out, hey
'Til the stars come out (hey)
'Til the stars come out (hey)
'Til the stars come out, yeah

Tonight I've got my eyes on you
I'm seeing the constellations
When I get afraid I shut down
Look for a way to run around the truth
But, baby, tonight I'm made of gold for you
Under the light of the silver half-moon

'Cause you'll only really see me when the sun goes down
You'll only really know me when I fall apart
Tonight we're gonna lie under the black sky, black sky
Baby, we ain't moving 'til the stars come out

Cause you'll only really see me when the sun goes down
You'll only really know me when I fall apart
Tonight we're gonna lie under the black sky, black sky
'Til the stars come out (hey)
'Til the stars come out (hey)
'Til the stars come out (hey)
'Til the stars come out, hey
'Til the stars come out (hey)
'Til the stars come out (hey)
'Til the stars come out, yeah
Baby, we ain't moving

Got your eyes on a deeper love (hey)
Got your eyes on a deeper love (hey)
Got your eyes on a deeper love (hey)
Tonight I'm gonna sit with you
While the L.A. skies are burning
Got your eyes on a deeper love
