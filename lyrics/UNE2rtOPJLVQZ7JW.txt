One scotch, one bourbon, one beer
One scotch, one bourbon, one beer
Please mister bartender, listen here
I ain't here for trouble, so have no fear
One scotch, one bourbon, one beer

I don't want soda nor bubble gum
You got what I want, just serve me some
Since my baby's been gone, everything is lost
I'm on this kick and I can't get off

One scotch, one bourbon, one beer
One scotch, one bourbon, one beer
Please mister bartender, listen here
I ain't here for trouble, so have no fear
One scotch, one bourbon, one beer

My woman started me on this spree
I can't find her and she can't find me
She left this morning, said she wouldn't stay
She's been out all night and it's the break of day

One scotch, one bourbon, one beer
One scotch, one bourbon, one beer
Please mister bartender, listen here
I ain't here for trouble, so have no fear
One scotch, one bourbon, one beer

One more nip and make it strong
I got to find my baby if it takes all night long
One scotch, one bourbon, one beer
One scotch, one bourbon, one beer
