Let me take you back
To the time when we were chasing all the girls
Two maniacs
Indulging in the pleasures of this world

So much to see, so much to live for
Questions to answer, places to go
So much to be, so much to care for
Deep down inside I think you know
You are free... come back to me!

Look ahead and see
There are still so many borders we could cross
Just you and me
Making up for all the time that we have lost

So much to see
He may be right
so much to live for
I've got to fight
Questions to answer
I will pull through
places to go
take me with you
So much to be
I will not break
so much to care for
I must awake
Deep down inside I think you know
I think I know
You are free
I am free
Come back to me!

Aaaah, aaaah come back to me
There's no way out, my whole world is black!
Aaaah, aaaah come back to me
I try to shout, something's holding me back!
