There was a grown man dying from fright
There was a grown man dying from fright
So surprised at the things he'd say
With a giant fantasy life
Runnin 'round on feet of clay

Naked except for a perpetual debt
That couldn't be stripped away
An unrightable wrong that moved him along
Closer to division day

Spent a long time living with that
Never could give it a name
And when you don't know what you're looking at
It makes it much harder to take

Mostly they'd meet when he was asleep
And have some sick exchange
That stuck him as wrong and moved him along
Closer to division day

I can't make an exception for a bad Connection
That only goes one way
Sell out for a song where I don't belong
With you on division day

The moon stood up on the ridge
Looking down where the water shines
And a man looking over the bridge
Like he done so many times

Thinking about how to stay out
Out of troubles way
And Flying to fall away from you all
It's over division day
Beautiful division day

Thinking about how to stay out
Out of troubles way
Flying to fall away from you all
It's over division day
Beautiful division day
