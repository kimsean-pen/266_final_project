I would have been in doubt
When this started out
That everything would turn out this way
First it was a phone call
Then it was another
From a mother who was ready to play

She said things that no one ever told me before
But how could I have known
That she wanted to settle a score

Then a man came in
I can finally see it
And it looks like you're having fun
But when I get back
You're gonna be bleeding
So I think son you better run
Now I think I should be leaving
'Cause it looks like I've had enough
She was a deceiver but I had to believe her
When she told me she was in love

I knew I could fix it
In just another minute
But I guess it was a minute too late
I knew he was coming
And I should have been running
If he caught me I would never escape

Now I know it never should have been a surprise
But how could I have known
That she was only telling me lies

'Cause a man came in
I thought you were leaving
But I see you're still having fun
Now I'm back and you're gonna be bleeding
So I think son you better run
Now I see I should be leaving
'Cause it looks like I've done enough
She was a deceiver but I had to believe her
When she told me she was in love

Don't blame me
It's not my fault
Don't blame me
I'm not the one

'Cause a man came in
I thought you were leaving
But I see you're still having fun
Now I'm back and you're gonna be bleeding
So I think son you better run
Now I see I should be leaving
'Cause it looks like I've done enough
She was a deceiver but I had to believe her
When she told me she was in love
She told me she was in love
