Take a hit, this is it
There's no turning back
Fantasy
Dressed in black
Told you so, boy you know
That you'd come right back
Faster than
A heart attack

Got you addicted
You can't help but want more
You'll give me anything just to make
The next score
Get what I want as I
Take over your world
Feels so good
To be a Bad Girl

So depraved, just a slave
Cause you need my touch
This feels so
Dangerous
Don't you stop, til you drop
Gotta keep it up
Ecstasy
Can't get enough
Like an obsession
Banging hard on my door
I got you begging with both
Knees on the floor
Get what I want as I
Take over your world
Feels so good
To be a Bad Girl

You know you want it
Cause I got it
I'm a Bad Girl
