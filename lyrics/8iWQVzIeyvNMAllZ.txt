You know I feel like I'm just a circuit
But there's no use without the part
And all the ticking sounds around you
That's the beating of my heart
All the wires feed me dreams I thought I never had

It's my world today
I don't have to stay
Break from the machine
Not that far away
I don't have to stay
Break from the machine

Learn the rhythm from the silence
(Learn the rhythm from the silence)
A little fire sparks would fall
(A little fire sparks would fall)
And your electric rivers' flowing
(And your electric rivers' flowing)
There's no way around the storm
(There's no way around the storm)
All the wires feed me dreams I thought I never had

It's my world today
I don't have to stay
Break from the machine
Not that far away
I don't have to stay
Break from the machine

It's my world today
I don't have to stay
Break from the machine

More than numbers
Out of order
Reaching over and over above them
Indestructible tiny blossoms
Keep them coming
They're coming, they're coming

It's our world today
We don't have to stay
Break from the machine
Not that far away
We don't have to stay
Break from the machine

It's our world today
We don't have to stay
Break from the machine
Not that far away
We don't have to stay
Break from the machine
