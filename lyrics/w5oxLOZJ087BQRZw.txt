We are Sex Bob-Omb and we're here to make
you think about death and get sad and stuff

This is the beginning of the song

I'm hearing voices, animal noises
The creme de la creme, effeminate abyss
And I'm reaching my threshold
Staring at the truth till I'm blind

My body's stupid, stereo putrid
Spilling out music into raw sewage
I'm reaching my threshold
Staring at the truth till I'm blind

My threshold
My threshold
Reaching my threshold

I'm hearing voices, animal noises
The creme de la creme, effeminate abyss
And I'm reaching my threshold
Staring at the truth till I'm blind

My threshold
I explode

Reaching my threshold
My threshold
My threshold
My threshold
