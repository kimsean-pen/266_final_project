Oh, my rose, you turned to stone in the sun
And I watch as you fade to gray
And oh my sun, you're falling now
So let me catch you
Hang you high, to do me well

Oh, you asked that I come home
And now I'm here and I see rain
Oh, I made my way home now, dear
And, oh, that's a beautiful thing

The mountains to the west
They're paved in gold
And to the east, Rainier is dark
Oh, it's dark and cold
I never asked much of you
But for you to stay
You closed your eyes, you gave me a smile
And you walked away

Oh, you asked that I come home
Now I'm here and I see rain
Oh, I made my way home now, dear
And, oh, that's a beautiful thing

Oh, you asked that I come home
Now I'm here and I see rain
Oh, I made my way home now, dear
And, oh, that's a beautiful thing
