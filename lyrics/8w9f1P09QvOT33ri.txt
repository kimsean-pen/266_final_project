Met a stranger on a train
he bumped right into me
I swear I didn't mean it
I swear it wasn't meant to be
must a been a dream
from a thousand years ago
I swear I didn't mean it
I swear it wasn't meant to be
from the bottom of my heart
he was looking all over me
together everafter
he said
"You take me & I'll be you"
"You kill him & I'll kill her"
kiss me
I swear it wasn't meant to be
I swear I didn't mean it
kiss me
kiss me in the shadow of
kiss me in the shadow of a doubt
kiss me
kiss me in the shadow
kiss me in the shadow of a doubt
