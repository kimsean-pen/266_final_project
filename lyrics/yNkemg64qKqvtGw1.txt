"We're rolling everybody
It starts with bass"

E I o I e I a

When you give your love away
You get a feeling for.
E I o I e I a
Live to love another day
Even when you feel unsure
More and more I wanna raise!
Raise my bar and raise your stay
E I o I e I a
When I lie they're wide awake
For my son I make
Tell my boy I love him so

Tell him so he know
Lost in Ethiopia
Walk out in that road
E I o I e I a

Something good gon' come your way
Just look out your door
E I o I e I a
Tell him what you wanna say
No matter whatcha mad at girl
Tell my boy I love him so

Tell him so he know
Lost in Ethiopia
Walk out in that road
E I o I e I a

Steal my heart to give away
Make me wanna say
E I o I e I a
You and I are so no same
More and more and more each day
Tell my boy I love him so
Tell him so he know
Lost in ethiopia
Walk out in that road
