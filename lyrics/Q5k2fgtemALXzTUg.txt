All the shades of gray that loom inside me
No one's ever home and there's no one around me
Such a perfect waste this soul behind me
No one really knows what truly drives me

I know what I've done wrong
I knew it all along
I can't let it go, let it go, let it go

Run away, run away
Look away, look away
I see inside you
I'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways
Run away, run away
Get away, get away
Leave me behind you
I'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways

All the shades of red that have designed me
All the hell I've seen, it still confines me
All the pain I felt, it's still inside me
All the rage I have, it still completes me

I know what I've done wrong
I knew it all along
I can't let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

Run away, run away
Look away, look away
I see inside you
I'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways
Run away, run away
Get away, get away
Leave me behind you
I'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways
Stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways

Run away, run away
Look away, look away
I see inside you
I'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways
Run away, run away
Get away, get away
Leave me behind you
I'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways
Stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways
