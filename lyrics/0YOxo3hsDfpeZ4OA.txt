Are you alone anymore
When you go home to your door?
I sometimes sit and wonder

Todavia quiero saber porque?
All that I want is to forget you

Todavia quiero saber porque?
All that I need is to erase you

I'm not at war anymore
Resistance fell at my sword
But I sometimes sit and wonder

Todavia quiero saber porque?
All that I want is to forget you

Todavia quiero saber porque?
All that I need is to erase you

What is it for?
What is this for?
If love is not for us
Then who is it for?

I am the rain on your head
I'm in your moonlit bed
I am your bastion of grace
I am the life that you saved
But I sometimes sit and wonder

You sometimes sit and wonder

Todavia quiero sabre porque?
All that I want is to forget you

Todavia quiero saber porque?
All that I need is to erase you
