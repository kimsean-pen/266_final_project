You best believe you came in with a real thang
Your own gait and way of walking in this simulated world
A kind of grease in the fulcrum of your inner space, that's your thang
You've got yours and I've got mine
Seat of the world inside

Stride grease
For to loosen up your hip
Joints and sink into
Your thang, your thang
Stride grease
For to loosen up your hip
Joints and sink into
Your thang, your thang
You've got a thang
Inside

As you release all resistance to your natural pace
Life-force collects in the basin of your openness
And as it spreads like a smile inside your waste, that's your thang
You've got yours and I've got mine
Seat of the world inside

Stride grease
For to loosen up your hip
Joints and sink into
Your thang, your thang
Stride grease
For to loosen up your hip
Joints and sink into
Your thang, your thang
You've got a thang
Inside

And you glide in step with your ownness
You're seated on a thang
A sweet bowl of individuality
Thickened in your soul distilled to fill it
Aren't you tired of walking around afraid you might spill it? Oh

You best believe you came in with a real thang
Your own gait and way of walking in this simulated world
You've got yours and I've got mine
Seat of the world inside
That's your thang

You're seated on a thang
A sweet bowl of individuality
Thickened in your soul distilled to fill it
Aren't you tired of walking around afraid you might spill it?

Stride grease
For to loosen up your hip
Joints and sink into
Your thang, your thang
Stride grease
For to loosen up your hip
Joints and sink into
Your thang, your thang

Stride grease
For to loosen up your hip
Joints and sink into
Your thang, your thang
Stride grease
For to loosen up your hip
Joints and sink into
Your thang, your thang

Stride grease
For to loosen up your hip
Joints and sink into
Your thang, your thang
Stride grease
For to loosen up your hip
Joints and sink into
Your thang, your thang
