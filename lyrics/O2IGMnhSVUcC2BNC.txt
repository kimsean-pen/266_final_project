How do you get out of bed in the morning
How do you wait to carry the day
They tell me good things come to those who wait
Despite the process along that came from fame
Yeah i sing for pleasure
I've sang for pain
I'm still half way to nowhere
I'm still nothing today.
Yeah i sing for pleasure
I've sang for pain
I'm still half way to nowhere
I'm still nothing today.
How do you get out of bed in the morning
How do you wait to carry the day
They tell me good things come to those who wait
Despite the process along that came from fame
Yeah i sing for pleasure
I've sang for pain
I'm still halfway to nowhere
I'm still nothing today
Yeah i sing for pleasure
I've sang for pain
I'm still halfway to nowhere
I'm still nothing today
(I'm still halfway to nowhere)
(Okay)
How do you get out of bed in the morning
How do you wait to carry the day
They tell me good things come to those who wait
Despite the process along that came from fame
Yeah i sing for pleasure
I've sang for pain
I'm still halfway to nowhere
I'm still nothing today
Yeah i sing for pleasure
I've sang for pain
I'm still halfway to nowhere
I'm still nothing today
