I was pretending to be floating strong but
I, I was sinking
Into still water

Eyes closed
All of the rest will flow

Then out of darkness I found I could
Still feel something good
Out of the woods

Eyes closed
All of the rest will flow
(I know, I know)
All of the rest will flow

One simple thing that I never could see
But now I know
All of the rest will flow

Stay with me my angel I found you, now
I don't feel low
All of the rest will flow
Eyes closed
All of the rest will flow

(I know, I know)
All of the rest will flow
Eyes closed
All of the rest will flow
All of the rest will flow
Eyes closed
All of the rest will flow
