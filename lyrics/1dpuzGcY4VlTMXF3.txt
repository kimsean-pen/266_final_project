If I get another chance at love
If I get another chance
I will call you my sweet thing
If I get another chance at love
If I get another chance
I'll hold you like I'm never leaving you

Everywhere I've been has got me right here now
I have no regrets (Have no regrets)
Every love I had, I bless you, thanks
I don't take it back (Don't take it back)
My love
(My love, my love, my love)
(My love, my love, my love)
(My love, my love, my love)
My love
(My love, my love, my love)
(My love, my love, my love)
(My love, my love, my love)

If I get another chance at love
If I get another chance
I will call you my sweet things
If I get another chance at love
If I get another chance
My kisses will be never-ending

If I get another chance at love
If I get another chance

Everywhere I've been has got me right here now
I have no regrets (Have no regrets)
If I have a chance to give
I'm not holding back (Not holding back)
My love
(My love, my love, my love)
(My love, my love, my love)
(My love, my love, my love)
My love
(My love, my love, my love)
(My love, my love, my love)
(My love, my love, my love)
