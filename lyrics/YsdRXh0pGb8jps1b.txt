Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

You
What do you, own the world
How do you own disorder, disorder
Now
Somewhere between the sacred silence
Sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere
Between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

More wood for their fires
Loud neighbors
Flashlight reveries
Caught in the headlights of a truck
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

You
What do you, own the world
How do you own disorder, disorder
Now
Somewhere between the sacred silence
Sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere
Between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

You
What do you, own the world
How do you own disorder
Now
Somewhere between the sacred silence
Sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere
Between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

When I became the sun
I shone life into the man's hearts
When I became the sun
I shone life into the man's hearts
