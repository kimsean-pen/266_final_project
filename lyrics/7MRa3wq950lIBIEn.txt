Is it hard to wait?
Drawn by your mongrel heart again
If they don't answer, would you want to be found out?
You duck through the wind in your old blight on the town

Love is turning you out
Sliding worry round
I try to warn its waiting game
To bring that spectre down

Would it be wrong
To clamp down on your racing heart? Love
And if they'd known, what sifted down to be found out?
It's not what you deserve

Love is turning you out
Sliding worry round
I try to warn its waiting game
To bring that spectre down

Faster than you were going to allow
Turn out the lights or say get out
If you don't answer, would you want to be found, love?
Five days on, trapped by a wave

Love is turning you out
Sliding worry round
I try to warn this waiting game
To bring that spectre down

Back from the sulking
You'll be cut down in the seedy stairway
If you don't answer, would you want to be found now?
Sapped from the bed to the window

Looking back on that time
Starting in the minds
What it is to be twenty nine
Fame sets your life down

Would it be wrong
Would it be wrong
To disappoint you now
Disappoint you now
