Oh god I better lay low
Rest my head on a bed called the guillotine ever so cold
Wait till you do what you do to me, yeah
I watch the clock count down
Tick tock like a lovely little melody Ratatatat
I hear a knock on my head, I say yeah?

There's something else, there's something else, there's something
There's something else, there's something else, there's something

Instead of biding my time
I sit alone on the guillotine
We could have talked
Finally feel like I'm coming clean, yeah

There's something else, there's something else, there's something
There's something else, there's something else, there's something

If we were built to last
Why we always fixing something
If we were built to last
Something from nothing

If we were built to last
Why we always fixing something
If we were built to last
Something from nothing

And I know it's in my head
Awake in a daydream
But I don't know how to help myself
So I lay on the guillotine
