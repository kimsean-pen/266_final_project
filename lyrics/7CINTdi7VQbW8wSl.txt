If there's anything you want
Come on back 'cause it's all still here
I'll be in the back room drinking my half of the beer
And if you and me is so right
Why is the same thing every night?

It's just a matter of time
It's almost measurable
Imagination ain't kind
on us
Tonight

You're at you best when you got the guns turned 180 degrees
And finding out if it adds all up right
We go through all the same lies and sell out to appease
But go to sleep in a bed of lies
I've made my own more than once or twice

And now time is my time
Time is my own
I feel so alive, yet I feel so alone
'Cause you know you're the one and that that hasn't changed
Since you were 19 and still in school
