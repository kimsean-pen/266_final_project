Walkin actin' cool so we dont show no low

Why they shootin' Church?
They throwin' bricks, like they tryna build
Can't comprehend I take 'em to Church on time like an AP
Put work in the rhyme no lazy
Lifted like I'm tryna lose kg's
Get stoned to the bone I'm crazy
Aye, they ticked off like I owe them, piss off you a modem
With the signals you be throwin', your connections in the soil, mud
L-Laggin' bruv, up in Carib with Daz and Dula
Packin' the grass for moolah, puff on the gas til' uma

Why they keep hatin' on little old me?
Mister I always say I'm seventeen
Mister was made to sit in limousine
Holiday cop me a whip but I mean
Thats only if my money long like centipede
Michelin energy I am a star
Rappin' for you is a shot in the dark
Rappin' for me is just proof that I'm on
Sauvignon blanc, I stole that shit and I gave it to mum
Mad at me huh? Better get used to it boy I ain't done

Mad at me huh? Better get used to it boy I ain't done
