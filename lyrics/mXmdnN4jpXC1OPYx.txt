Lovely disguise
Read between the lines
You rock the magic plane with no abbreviation
Three
Four
You sell what you bought
And there ain't no magic pen
To get back what you lost

I like it when we talk about love
I like it when you talk about love
You always were my favorite drug
Even when when we used to take drugs

Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take

Penguins don't fly
Crocodile Sunday smile
Really love to fish
But don't like superficial people
Shoe store
Heard it all before
From pearly whites to pearly gates
What do we have to argue 'bout?

I like it when we talk about love
I like it when you talk about love
You always were my favorite drug
Even when when we used to take drugs

Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take
Even when we used to take

Leave me all alone before
Get out the way
Never did what she was told
Get out the way
Seems to play at time of war
Get out the way
Less is big and listens more

Even when we used to take
Used to take
Even when we used to take
Take
