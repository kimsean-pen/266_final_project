Everything just falls away
Just give it back into your arms
So many pieces fall away
Just give 'em back into your heart
I feel that one more day is gone
You may never see the dawn
But nothin' ever stays the same
It's fighting you at every turn

Like a door that never opens wide
You just get kicked until your heart's bled dry
The road is gone but there's a line you cross
And I don't think you'll stop

I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
With bad blood and feelings
Just bad blood and feelings
Just bad blood and feelings

So many pieces fall away
Just give 'em back into your heart
So many people fall away
Just let them go into the dark
And every night I stay awake
The feelin' running through my blood
But all I've got is faith and science
A line that will only blur

Like a door that never opens wide
You just get kicked until your heart's bled dry
The road is gone but there's a line you cross
And I don't think you'll stop

I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
With bad blood and feelings
Just bad blood and feelings
Just bad blood and feelings

I'm not slave to a world I could never save
As the light just disintegrates in the final hour
You never felt you were so alive
And you thought it could never die
Now you just look back and wonder why it could never be

I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
With bad blood and feelings
Just bad blood and feelings
Just bad blood and feelings
Just bad blood and feelings
Bad blood and feelings
