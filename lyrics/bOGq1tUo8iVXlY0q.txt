These waterfalls I've seen a million times
They wash away the world that I've seen covering up my mind
And I can push the walls away untill they're out of sight and mind
But I'm not strong enough to stand alone here in this tide

I don't want you, I'm not trying
I wish it would just go away

And then I see red... I see red
I see red... I see red

These situations make me feel so cold
It's like I've been replaced by someone I don't know
And I can't say the words untill I've said all that I can say
But without you I'm a fraction of who I'm supposed to be

Breathe me in and take me under
Crack these walls and let's start again

And then I see red... I see red
I see red... I see red
I see red... I see red
I see red... I see red

We can run we can hide, we can live without it
It's the same in us, it takes the blame in us
We can love we can hate, we can live without it
We're not alone, there's more than this

We can run we can hide, we can live without it
It's the same in us, it takes the blame in us
We can love we can hate, we can live without it
We're not alone, there's more than this

There's nothing left, but the sound of my heart
There's nothing left, but the strings on this guitar
Take it all, take the hurt and heartache
Help me start again... ohhh

There's nothing left, but the sound of my heart
There's nothing left, but the strings on this guitar
Take it all, take the hurt and heartache
Help me start again
We can run we can hide, we can live without it
It's the same in us, it takes the blame in us
We can love we can hate, we can live without it
We're not alone, there's more than this
We can run we can hide, we can live without it
It's the same in us, it takes the blame in us
We can love we can hate, we can live without it
We're not alone, there's more than this
