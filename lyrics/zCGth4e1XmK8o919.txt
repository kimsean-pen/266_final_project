Ah, ah, ah aye! Oh, oh, oh oye
Most High

I can see from where I stand that I'm not the only one
Going through tribulation, and to thee Most High we have to run
So when you can't take no more what you done
Jah-Jah come when we give him attention
Some things no run how we plan
But according to Jah-Jah plan

I say
Calling unto the Most High
Calling unto the Most High
Calling unto the Most High
Calling unto the Most High!
Calling to the Most High
Calling unto the Most High
Calling to the Most High
Call on him, call on him!

Be facing frustration
But you're not the only one
When feel devastation
Don't let it get you down,
Trod like lion!
The same tribulation
A the same thing wha make we strong
Them things a gwan fe so long
All part a Jah-Jah plan
I say

Calling to the Most High
Calling unto the Most High
Calling to the Most High
Calling unto the Most High!
Calling to the Most High
Calling unto the Most High
Calling to the Most High
Call on him, call on him!
Call on him
Pray to him
