Sitting alone
Scratch at your skin
Call out your name
I don't feel the same

Reach out for you I
Reach out for you I
Forget your face.

So low like your heart
So vain like a scar
So faint like a star
So far away

Reach out for you I
Fall down for you I
Forget your face.

Sitting alone
Scratch at your skin
Call out your name
I don't feel the same

Reach out for you I
Fall down for you I
Reach out for you I
I Die for you I
Forget your face.

So low like your heart
So vain like a scar
So faint like a star
So far away

Reach out for you I
Fall down for you I
I forget your face.

Reach out for you I
Fall down for you I
Reach out for you I
I Die for you I
Forget your face.
