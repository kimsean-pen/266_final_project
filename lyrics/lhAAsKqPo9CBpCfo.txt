Still down south
After all these years
Twist and shout
Inbetween the tears.

And i don't wanna dance with my baby
In front of the whole street
And i don't need advice from my brother On how to keep baby sweet
Well right.

Rock house blues
Got it's tapping shoes
You and I,
Nothing else to lose

And i don't wanna dance with my baby In front of the whole street
And i don't need advice from my brother On how to keep baby sweet
And i don't wanna dance with my baby In front of the whole street
And I don't need advice from my brother on how to keep baby sweet.
Baby sweet
Baby sweet
Baby sweet
Well right.

Well right.
And i don't wanna dance with my baby In front of the whole street
And I don't need advice from my brother on how to keep baby sweet
And i don't wanna dance with my baby In front of the whole street
And i don't need advice from my brother on how to keep baby sweet
Baby sweet
Baby sweet
Baby sweet, Yeah.
