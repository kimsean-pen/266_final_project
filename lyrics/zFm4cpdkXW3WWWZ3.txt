You wave at the sky with wide lovely eyes
Waves and waves of love good-bye
And through the garden with your secret key
Down the tunnel that leads to the sea

Step on the beach beneath the iron skies
You wave and wave your wide lovely eyes
Crystal waves and waves of love
You wave and say good-bye

Your dress size with your wide lovely strides
And all along the street lately the stories abound
They've dismantled the fun fair and they've shut down the rides
And they've hung the mermaids from the street lights by their hair

And with wide lovely eyes you wave at the sky
And me at the high window watching you ride
The waves of blue and the waves of love
You wave and say good-bye

The night expands, I am expanding
I watch your hands like butterflies bending
All among the myths and the legends we create
And all the laughing stories we tell our friends
Close the windows, clear up the myths
It's gettin' late
It's darker and closer to the end

Through the tunnel and down the sea
And on the pebble beach, your laces you untie
In a range of shoes, side by side
You wave and wave your wide lovely eyes
Distant waves and waves of distant love
You wave and say good-bye
