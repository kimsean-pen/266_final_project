When life is too much
Roll with it, baby
Don't stop and lose your touch
Oh no, baby
Hard times knocking on your door

I'll tell them you ain't there no more
Get on through it

Roll with it, baby

Luck will come and then slip away
You've gotta move bring it back to stay

You just roll with it, baby
Come on and just roll with it, baby
You and me
Roll with it, baby

Hang on and just roll with it, baby
Hey

The way that you love is good as money
I swear by stars above sweet as honey
People think you're down and out
You show them what it's all about

You can make it
Roll with it, baby

When this world turns its back on you

Hang in and do that sweet thing you do

You just roll with it, baby
Hey-hey
You just roll with it, baby

Come on and just roll with it, baby
You and me

Just roll with it, baby
Roll with it, baby
Hey-hey
You just roll with it, baby

You and me
Just roll with it, baby
Hang on and just roll with it, baby
Hey
Now there'll be a day
You'll get there, baby
You'll hear the music play
You'll dance, baby
You'll leave bad times way behind
Nothing but good times on your mind
You can do it
Roll with it, baby

Then you'll see life will be so nice
It's just a step up to paradise

Just roll with it, baby
Hey-hey
You just roll with it, baby
You and me
Just roll with it, baby
Hang on and just roll with it, baby
Hey-hey
Come on
Roll with me, baby
Hang on, baby
Come on
Roll with me, baby
Roll...
Hey
Come on roll
Come on roll with me, baby
Come on
Hang on just roll
Hey-hey
Come on
Hey-hey
