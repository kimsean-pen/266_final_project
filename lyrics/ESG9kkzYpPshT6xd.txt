I did seen the eyes upon us
And I don't think they want us to get there
I have thought it through
And now it's coming for you so shelter

All the lines that I drawn and the women I embrace
Are all agreed upon with the man who owns the place
It's over

It is what can even leave between you and me this truth, this terror
And it stares us in the face until we break our nose against the mirror
Well I loved you for your madness
But now it is grown out of proportions through the cracks in your throne, sister

The number of vice that are pointing at me are growing
And this fear takes the size my father before me was showing
We get tempted by the lies of the whores and their eyes of crystal
And which I can read the number of paces and the joys of the blister

My soul conceils alot of corners their secrets are yours
Well as I never dare to this sin through the doors
Leading to yours

All the lines that I drawn and the women I embrace
Are all agreed upon with the man who owns the place
It's over
