I am floating out to sea
Time will take it all from me
Don't know where the wind will take me now
But we'll see
But we'll see

I am searching undersea
I'm right where I want to be
Don't where this road will take me now
But we'll see
But we'll see

I guess we will see
Won't you show me?
Won't you show me?
Won't you show me?

Close my eyes and I can't see
All these lights are lighting me
Don't know where my mind will take me now
We will see
But we'll see
All this longing to be free
What a life could let it be
Don't know when will I ever find out how
We will see
But we'll see

I guess we will see
I guess we will see
Won't you show me?
Won't you show me?
Won't you show me?

I am floating out to sea
Time will take it all from me
Don't know where the wind will take me now
But we'll see
But we'll see
