Boys and girls of every age
Wouldn't you like to see something strange?
Come with us and you will see

This our town of Halloween
This is Halloween,
This is Halloween

Pumpkins scream in the dead of night
This is Halloween,

Everybody make a scene
Trick or treat 'till the neighbours gonna die of fright
In this town,
Everybody scream
In this town of Halloween

I am the one hiding under your bed
Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red
I am the one hiding under your stairs

Fingers like snakes with spiders in my hair
This is Halloween,
This is Halloween

Halloween,
Halloween,

Halloween,
Halloween

In this town,

We call home
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song
In this town

Don't we love it now?
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise
Round that corner then,

Hiding in the trash can
Something's waiting and it'll pounce
And how you'll scream!

This is Halloween
Red and black and slimy green

Aren't you scared?
Well, that's just fine!
Say it once,
Say it twice
Take a chance and roll the dice

Ride with the moon in the dead of night
Everybody scream,

Everybody scream!
In our town of Halloween
I am the clown with the tear away face
Here in a flash and gone without a trace
I am the 'who' when you call "who's there?"
I am the wind blowing through your hair
I am the shadow in the moon at night
Filling your dreams to the brim with fright
This is Halloween,
This is Halloween
Halloween,
Halloween,
Halloween,
Halloween
Tender lumplings everywhere
Life's no fun without a good scare
That's our job,
But we're not mean
In our town of Halloween
In this town,
Don't we love it now?
Everyone's waiting for the next surprise
Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back
And scream like a banshee
Make you jump out of your skin!
This is Halloween,
Everybody scream
Won't you please make way for a very special guy?
Skeleton Jack is king of the pumpkin patch
Everyone hail to the pumpkin king now
This is Halloween,
This is Halloween
Halloween,
Halloween,
Halloween,
Halloween
In this town,
We call home
Everyone hails to the pumpkin song
Lalalalalala
Halloween
Halloween
Lalalalalalalala
Halloween
Halloween
Lalalalalalalala
Halloween
Halloween
Lalalalalalalalala
Wheeeeeeee...!
