The water's edge is where she waits
Lost soul still wandering
Meant to die
But she's stuck not crossing over

The other side is where he waits
His spirit reaching out
Meant to save
But she's too scared to take his hand

Living in a world without you
Drowning in the past
Is living in no world at all
So now I call on you

Remember me, I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering was all in vain
It's almost over now
Don't turn your back on paradise

Feeling scared
She's prepared to give up everything
She can't stand
To feel like half of her is fading

He will choose the only way
To rid her of her pain
Take her soul now
The decision has been made

Living in a world without love
A burden to my soul
Is living in a worthless world
So I will call on you

Remember me, I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering was all in vain
It's almost over

Remember me, you were so young
How could I tell you?
Remember me, I am the one
Who saved your life that night

I was the one
who would not abandon you
Even in death I was the one
who would not leave you

I used my freedom to protect you
And all the while direct you
Do you remember me this time?
Even in death I gave you life
I gave you life

I wanted to deserve a place
A place beside you
This time when I reached out my hand
It reached all the way to heaven
Remember me, I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering was all in vain
It's almost over now
Goodbye
It's almost over now
Goodbye
It's time
I release you from this life
Don't turn your back on paradise
