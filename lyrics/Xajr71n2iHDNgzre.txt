Kiss you in the park
We'll meet up after dark
In your car with the backseat southern summer
Ignored all the missed calls from your mother
And kiss me in the park
We'll meet up after dark
And we'll talk until morning hits the windshield
And paints yellow lines on the field
Now you want to start
With someone not so far
Oh she's bubbly and sweet like a Coca-Cola
I watch from my drink as you look her over
The town don't part too hard
They're sick of playing cards
With their luck, you want warm and I'm somethin' colder
I'm putting your hands to her heart

Don't think of my life anywhere but in your arms tonight
Won't say it this time, can't even look back in your eyes

Kiss you in the park
We'll meet up after dark
It's a bite of the apple, the touch of your lips
I'm stuck in the bathroom and sick over it
You're made from the stars
And we watch from your car
AndI'm just a victim of changing planets
My Scorpio rising and my parents

Don't think of my life anywhere but in your arms tonight
Won't say it this time, can't even look back in your eyes
