Don't wanna wait for tomorrow, I'm gonna say it today
I'm sick of making excuses, I'm sick of being afraid
When all we have is a moment with so much left to say
Don't wanna wait for tomorrow, I'm gonna say it today

'Cause all my life I've tried to hide behind the fear inside
And I can't remember why

Sometimes you gotta go down swinging
Get up, get up, feel the kick drum beating
One more time
One more time tonight
Sometimes you gotta fight that feeling
Get up, get up, feel your heart still beating
One more time
One more time tonight

I know you're chasing tomorrow, but don't give up on today
If you keep making excuses, you'll always stand in your way
When all we have is a moment with so much left to say
I know you're chasing tomorrow, but don't give up on today

'Cause all your life you've tried to hide behind the fear inside
But you can't remember why

Sometimes you gotta go down swinging
Get up, get up, feel the kick drum beating
One more time
One more time tonight
Sometimes you gotta fight that feeling
Get up, get up, feel your heart still beating
One more time
One more time tonight

I don't wanna feel down, down, down
When nobody's around, 'round, 'round
I don't wanna feel down, down, down
When nobody's around
I don't wanna feel down, down, down
When nobody's around, 'round, 'round
I don't wanna feel down, down, down
When nobody's around

Sometimes you gotta go down swinging
Get up, get up, feel the kick drum beating
One more time
One more time tonight
Sometimes you gotta fight that feeling
Get up, get up, feel your heart still beating
One more time
One more time tonight

One more time
