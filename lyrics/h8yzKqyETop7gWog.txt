Here we go

She's looking good
From head to toe
She's licking her paws, yeah
She's ready to blow
Got teeth like razors
And claws like knives
She's ready to pounce on your ass
You know you won't survive

She's got the eyes of a panther
She's got lips like Satan
She's got the eyes of a panther
And soon you'll be a matin'
She's got the eyes of a panther

She's making you crazy
Like a cat in heat
Got her claws running down your back, wow
Under the sheets
She's on the prowl, meow
Jaws ready to snap
Like a game of cat and mouse
You're caught in her trap

She's got the eyes of a panther
And a tongue like a cow, yeah
She's got the eyes of a panther
You're gonna be her chow, yeah
She's got the eyes of a panther

She said, "Don't be afraid of heavy metal"
"Don't be afraid to rock, to rock, to rock"
She said, "Don't be afraid, no"
So I won't

You're hiding in the shadows
And you can hear her breath
Your heart's pounding like a bass drum, boom-boom-boom
Ready to meet your death, death, death
She swats you down with a paw
As she walks away
She wants a meal, not a snack
She's on to bigger prey (bigger prey)

She's got the eyes of a panther
Yeah the cougar is a waitin'
She's got the eyes of a panther
There'll be no escapin'
She's got the eyes of a panther

She got them eyes
She got them eyes
She got eyes
She got teeth like razors, eyes like lasers
Ready to pounce, your life is in danger
She got eyes
