I'd like to find something
I got my best dress on
And I'll play from 'Dusk Till Dawn'
And 'When You Sleep Tonight'

I'd hold my pillow tight
I'd turn all the lights off

Oh, I say, don't say
That you're up to nothing
Your sure up to something
Today, boy I'll start a laughing
'Cause you will pay

Save the lies I'm a saying
I might get a bit rough
If he ain't good to me
Oh, good to me

So I say with a smile
'Cause I know that he'll be good
You better be good to me
You better be good

You better treat me nice
Or I'll come back to bite
Boy, just you wait
And see I'll throw you
In skin deep into reality
No this ain't fantasy

Oh, I say, don't say
That you're up to nothing
Your sure up to something
Today, boy I'll start a laughing
'Cause you will pay

Save the lies, I'm a saying
I might get a bit rough
If he ain't good to me
Oh, good to me

So I say with a smile
Cause I know that he'll be good
You better be good to me
You better be good

Save the lies I'm a saying
I might get a bit rough
If he ain't good to me
Oh, good to me

So I say with a smile
'Cause I know that he'll be good
You better be good to me
You better be good

Gonna set your bright, soul alight
I'm gonna play my right card tonight
I'm gonna fly my bike, ride my kite
I'm gonna eat you up bite you by the

Gonna set your bright soul alight
I'm gonna play my right card tonight
I'm gonna fly my bike ride my kite
I'm gonna eat you up bite you by the

Save the lies I'm a saying
I might get a bit rough
If he ain't good to me
Oh, good to me

So I say with a smile
'Cause I know that he'll be good
You better be good to me
You better be good
