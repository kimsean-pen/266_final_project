I washed all the windows
Threw away the sheets that we used
All the towels are getting laundered
All our pictures in the desk drawer

But I want you back
In the middle of the night
I want you back
In the middle of this fight
I never sleep
In the middle of the night
I want you back
In the middle of this fight

Baby, come back and fight
Baby, come back and fight
With me

I don't do the things I used to do
I don't drink the way I used to
All your advice, I finally took it
When you're not around to see me do it

But I want you back
In the middle of the night
I want you back
In the middle of this fight
I never sleep
And I've gotta get it right
I want you back
In the middle of this fight

Baby, come back and fight
Baby, come back and fight
With me

I don't want us just to be a memory
Baby, come back and fight with me
I don't want us just to be a memory
Baby, come back and fight with me
I don't want us just to be a memory
Baby, come back and fight with me
I don't want us just to be a memory
Baby, come back and fight with me (I want you back)

I don't want us just to be a memory
Baby, come back and fight with me
I don't want us just to be a memory
Baby, come back and fight with me (I want you back)
I don't want us just to be a memory
Baby, come back and fight with me
I don't want us just to be a memory (I want you back)
