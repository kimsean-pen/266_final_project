I see stars
In your eyes
Did they play, did the play, did the play
That lovely song for you
I am thilled by the way
Your arms movie as you sway
When you dance night into my arms

Dance! Darling dance!
Darling smile as you dance darling
Dance! Darling dance!
Darling I am in love with you

Oh Oh Oh Oh
While I hold you, hold you near me
Ill swear I love you dearly
And as we stroll step and dance
Folks will know
At a glance
About our tender romance

Oh Oh Oh Oh
Sway! Darling sway darling
Well dance til day darling
Now that youre captured my heart

Oh Oh Oh Oh
While I hold you, hold you near me
Ill swear I love you dearly
And as we stroll step and dance
Folks will know
At a glance
About our tender romance

Oh Oh Oh Oh
Sway! Darling sway darling
Well dance til day darling
Now that youre captured my heart

I see stars
In your eyes
