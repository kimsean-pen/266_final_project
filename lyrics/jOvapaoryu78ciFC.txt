Wire wings and you catch them in clouds
Orange radiates from the inside out
Forage moon, will you light the way south
Sharing blue wearing white flowers we file the edge down

Over dunes watching echoes she sounds
Hungry for loneliness but the thirst stays; unsated, unbound
Vital tears draw the inside out
Focus beams on this crumbling house

Heart silent, bizarre to be loved how you wanted
I'm still a nervous wreck
(Yay yeah, yeah)
Blood in your veins
Fed by fire flowing both ways
Looking for a place
(Yay yeah, yeah)

While its clear, tasting sun in your mouth
Bathed in fear, finally listening now
No use, swallow, the feelings worse
Nothing follows but nothing hurts
Buried impulse in the snow
Fading fast while down to hell it goes
(Yay yeah, yeah)

Blood in your veins
Fed by fire flowing both ways
Looking for a place
(Yay yeah, yeah)

Flowing both ways
Flowing both ways
Flowing both ways
Flowing both ways
Flowing both ways
Flowing both ways
Flowing both ways
Flowing both ways
Flowing both ways
Flowing both ways
Flowing both ways
Flowing both ways
Flowing both ways
Flowing both ways
Flowing both ways
Flowing both ways
