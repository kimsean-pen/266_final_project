They're getting ugly
They're a horror show
And now we're laughing
Because they'll never know
That they have everything
We give them all of our own
And they tell us they're sick and they're all alone

They make fools of us together but we always think of them
All their laughing and their talking and their wasting of our time
And it always hurts to see them now that everything is different
We don't like to see their eyes 'cause they will never look the same

They shut the door
We fell far behind
We try forgiveness
But they cross the line
And now the moment has passed
And we can't rewind
We are dead long before we run out of time

They make fools of us together but we always think of them
All their laughing and their talking and their wasting of our time
And it always hurts to see them now that everything is different
We don't like to see their eyes 'cause they will never look the same

They make fools of us together but we always think of them
All their laughing and their talking and their wasting of our time
And it always hurts to see them now that everything is different
We don't like to see their eyes 'cause they will never look the same
