Tell me why, I feel nothing at all
Did I showed them the place I draw my thoughts?
Cause they come in circle around my mind
Taking everything that's mine

Like a pack of wolves
Searching for their food
They'll take everything you know
And everything you knew
Like a pack of

Take me back, to when my eyes were far
The things I've seen, the things I call my joys
Cause they come in circle around my mind
Taking everything that's mine
I lose in every sense of pray
I need a soul in which I can confide

Like a pack of wolves
Searching for their food
They'll take everything you know
And everything you knew
Like a pack of wolves

This is your turn to fly
Don't you let them hold you down, down, down.
This is your choice to shine,
Don't you let them bring you down, down, down.
