Deserted throne
Radioactive
Hum is gone
Cold alone
Lifeless time
Lifelong crime
Witness the unstated
A moon
Without light of its own
Alone
Shadows are gone
A moon
Without light of its own
Alone
Shadows are gone
Pale caress
Tender stress
Devil in the backdrop
Hurtful sting
Trembling
Disregard the hatred
Disregard the hated
A moon
Without light of its own
Alone
Shadows are gone
A moon
Without light of its own
Alone
Shadows are gone
A moon
Without light of its own
Alone
Shadows are gone
A moon
Without light of its own
Alone
Shadows are gone
