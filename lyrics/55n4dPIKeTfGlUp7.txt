she laid her head
on my chest
as the sun burned
down the west
there's one thing we still got
this one last dance in this parking lot

oh yeah, I, I got a heart of darkness
oh yeah, I, I got a heart of darkness

then she woke up
into the fire
and the flames kept
dancing higher
satan would laugh at her screams
then she woke up from her dreams

oh yeah, I, I got a heart of darkness
oh yeah, I, I got a heart of darkness
