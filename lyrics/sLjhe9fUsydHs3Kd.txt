In my left hand there is the familiar
In my right hand there's the great unknown
I can see the madly different grass there
But I'm drawn to wilder nights at home

Don't listen to your friends
See the despair behind their eyes
Don't listen to your friends
They only care once in a while

I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me
I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me

Are you drifting way beyond what's normal?
Cause round your mind ring the words that they would say
When you go home everything looks different
And you're scared of being left behind

Just listen to your friends
Trust that they're fair, look in their eyes
Just listen to your friends
They only care and hope you're alright

I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me
I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me

I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me
I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me

I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me
I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me

I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me
I can feel the draw
The draw
The draw
The draw
