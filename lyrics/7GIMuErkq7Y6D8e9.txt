I may be loose, I'm not a canon
But I can be quiet saying my name
There are the weights; where is the balance?
Maybe everyone's to blame

My heart and my mind have been with me always
But not long enough to keep them in line
I know that my mind has both good and bad days
But my heart wins every time

I feel a fire,
I see a flame, set me alight,
Bring me desire, bottled up tight.
Like caging the ocean
Dousing the sun, download the sky
Bring me emotion, bottled up tight

I count when I can the people who walk by,
Imagine their paths crossing with mine,
And maybe it's true, we're part of a blood line,
But we walk like we're pretty much blind

I feel a fire,
I see a flame, set me alight,
Bring me desire, bottled up tight.
Like caging the ocean
Dousing the sun, download the sky
Bring me emotion, bottled up tight

I feel a fire,
I see a flame, set me alight,
Bring me desire, bottled up tight.
Like caging the ocean
Dousing the sun, download the sky
Bring me emotion, bottled up tight

I feel a fire, bring me desire
I feel a fire, bottled up tight.
Like caging the ocean, you play my emotion.
And give me devotion, bottled up tight
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
