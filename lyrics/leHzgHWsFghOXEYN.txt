Oh shit!
Oh shit!
Oh shit! (Are you ready for this?)
Oh shit!
Oh!
It's me, Fergie
The pimp, Polow!
Fergie Ferg, what's up baby?
Come on!

When I come to the club step aside (Oh shit!)
Part the seas, don't be havin' me in the line (Oh shit!)
V.I.P. 'cause you know I gotta shine (Oh shit!)
I'm Fergie Ferg and me love you long time (Oh shit!)
All my girls get down on the floor (Oh shit!)
Back to back, drop it down real low (Oh shit!)
I'm such a lady but I'm dancin' like a ho (Oh shit!)
'Cause you know I don't give a fuck, so here we go! (Oh shit!)

How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna go down like
London London London, wanna go down like
London London London, we goin' down like
How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna go down like
London London London, wanna go down like
London London London, we goin' down like

Drinks start pourin' and my speech start slurrin'
Everybody start lookin' real good (Oh shit!)

That Grey Goose got your girl feelin' loose
Now I'm wishin' that I didn't wear these shoes
It's like e'ry time I get up on a dude
Paparazzi put my business in the news
And I'm like, "Get up out my face! (Oh shit!)
'Fore I turn around and spray your ass with mace!" (Oh shit!)
My lips make you want to have a taste (Oh shit!)
You got that? I got the bass
(Ooh!)

How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna go down like
London London London, wanna go down like
London London London, we goin' down like
How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna go down like
London London London, wanna go down like
London London London, we goin' down like

La (da-da-da-da-da) Da da da da
(Da-da-da-da-da) Doo doo doo doo
Me like a bullet type, you know they comin' right
Fergie like 'em long time, my girls support, right?
La (da-da-da-da-da) Da da da da
