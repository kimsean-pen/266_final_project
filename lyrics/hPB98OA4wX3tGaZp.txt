[Lil' Kim
If You See A 745 And The Body Is Wide
Take A Peak And Make Sure Ain't Nobody Inside
Fuckin With The Bee You Might Not Make It Alive
Cause It's Murdahhh; Ain't Talkin Irv And Ja
Y'all Sleep On Baby Girl, I Seldom Frown
Spit The Shank Out My Mouth, And Bust You Down
Biggie Left Me The Torch, So I'm Holdin It Now
And You Sick Cause I'm A Bitch And I'm Holdin It Down
If Styles Say Get You, Without No Doubt
I'm A Sex You Real Good Then I'm Airin You Out
Rep Your Coast, We Got The Crack, One Hit You Overdosed
That Shadow That You See, That's My Motherfucker Ghost
(Whattup Nigga?) S.p., Lil' Kim, We In It To Win It
Do A Bid For My Crimey, That's My Co-Defendant
And You Snitch Niggaz Tryin To Get A Nigga Locked Up
Come Through In The Ice Cream Truck And Tear Your Whole Block Up

You Know The Ghost'll Steal Your Soul From You
Lil' Kim'll Pull The Four And Leave A Motherfuckin Hole In You
I Need An Antidote. To Take Away The Pain
I Gotta Smoke Weed Or Crack A Nigga Canteloupe
I Used To Dream Of This (I Used To) But Now I Got
The Money And The House And The Shit Seem Meaningless
(What's It All Worth?) If The Grind Don't Ever Stop (Huh)
Then My Mind Won't Ever Stop, Nine Won't Ever Stop (Uh-Uh)
They Say You Too Violent (Fuck You) I Say You Too Silent
You Scared To Represent, I'ma Make The News Column
This Is Holiday And Lil' Kim (Yes It Is)
