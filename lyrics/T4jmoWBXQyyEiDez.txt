I can't tell if I'm dreaming
I'm not sleeping anymore
(Am I falling to pieces?)
Will you wake me when it's over
Nothing makes sense anymore
(Am I falling to pieces?)

I won't dwell on tomorrow
'Cause it feels like such a waste of time
And it cuts me from the inside
But I know I'm gonna be alright

My eyes are wide open
Build me up, build me up to tear me down
Sick of going through the motions
You're the gravity that keeps me falling
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Giving up, giving up so you should know
My eyes are wide open
You're the gravity that keeps pulling me down

Still stuck going nowhere
Been here many times before
Never knowing the reason
Blocking out all the voices
Screaming just to be ignored
Were never given a reason

I won't dwell on tomorrow
'Cause it feels like such a waste of time
And it cuts me from the inside
But I know I'm gonna be alright
Forgiven, forgotten
Not looking for apologies
It feels like I'm broken
But I know I'm gonna be alright

My eyes are wide open
Build me up, build me up to tear me down
Sick of going through the motions
You're the gravity that keeps me falling
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Giving up, giving up so you should know
My eyes are wide open
You're the gravity that keeps pulling me down

Whoa-oh-oh
Build me up, build me up to tear me down
Whoa-oh-oh
Giving up, giving up so you should know
Whoa-oh-oh
Build me up, build me up to tear me down
Whoa-oh-oh
You're the gravity that keeps pulling me down

I can't tell if I'm dreaming
I'm not sleeping anymore
(Am I falling to pieces?)

My eyes are wide open
Build me up, build me up to tear me down
Sick of going through the motions
You're the gravity that keeps me falling
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Giving up, giving up so you should know
My eyes are wide open
You're the gravity that keeps pulling me down (Ooh)
You're the gravity that keeps pulling me down (Ooh)
I'm giving up, giving up so you should know

Whoa-oh-oh
Build me up, build me up to tear me down
Whoa-oh-oh
Giving up, giving up so you should know

I can't tell if I'm dreaming
I'm not sleeping anymore
(Am I falling to pieces?)
