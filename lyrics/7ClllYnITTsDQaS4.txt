I'm going toe-to-toe
With a greedy soul
He's going down tonight
Gonna be out a while
She's got a six six six
I've got a crucifix
She's got a spinning head
Like seeing Grateful Dead

You're getting told
You greedy soul
You've been telling lies
You're a slippery kind

And it's a long way down
When you're the wrong way round
And that was all too much
I got the Midas touch

They're digging me for gold
Well if the truth be told
He got you kiss and tell
I hope you go to hell
I'm going walking (???)
You think I'm giving up
I got a wild heart
Don't give a fuck, alright?

And it's a long way down
When you're the wrong way round
And that was all too much
I got the Midas touch

And it's a long way down
[?] lost and found
And that was all too much
I got the Midas touch

And it's a long way down
When you're the wrong way round
And that was all too much
I got the Midas touch
