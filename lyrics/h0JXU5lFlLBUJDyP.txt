love's got an enemy
it's bleeding inside of me
I can't get enough of it

raging people all
I got you inside my home
and when I feel it
I better run

I
better run
'cause I don't know if we
will make it through this one

but in the end we somehow
always end up without
marks that don't allow

us to reunite
I
better run
'cause I don't know if we
will make it through his one
