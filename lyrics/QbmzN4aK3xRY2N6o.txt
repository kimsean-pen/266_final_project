Make the people
Hold each other's hand
And fill their hearts with truth
You made up your mind
So do as divined

Put on your armor
Ragged after fights
Hold up your sword
You're leaving the light
Make yourself ready
For the lords of the dark
They'll watch your way
So be cautious, quiet and hark

You hear them whispering
In the crowns of the trees
You're whirling 'round
But your eyes don't agree
Will 'O' the Wisps
Misguiding your path
You can't throw a curse
Without takin' their wrath

Watch out for the Seas of Hatred and Sin
Or all us people forget what we've been
Our only hope's your victory
Kill that Satan who won't let us be
Our only hope's your victory
Kill that Satan who won't let us be - kill

You're the Keeper of the Seven Keys
That lock up the Seven Seas
And the Seer of Visions said before he went blind
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're in will soon all be sold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold

You can feel cold sweat
Running down your neck
And the Dwarfs of Falseness
Throw mud at your back

Guided by spells
From the old Seer's hands
You're suffering pain
Only steel can stand

Stay well on your way and follow the sign
Fulfill your own promise and do what's devined
The Seven Seas are far away
Placed in the Valley of Dust, Heat and Sway
The Seven Seas are far away
Placed in the Valley of Dust, Heat and Sway

You're the Keeper of the Seven Keys
That lock up the Seven Seas
And the Seer of Visions said before he went blind
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're in will soon all be sold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold

Throw the first key into the Sea of Hate

Throw the second key into the Sea of Fear

Throw the third key into the Sea of Senselessness
And make the people hold each other's hands
The fourth key belongs into the Sea of Greed
And the fifth into the Sea of Ignorance

Disease, disease, disease my friend
For this whole world's in Devil's hand
Disease, disease, disease my friend
Throw the key or you may die

Disease, disease, disease my friend
For this whole world's in Devil's hand
Disease, disease, disease my friend
Throw the key or you may die

On a mound at the shore of the last sea
He is sitting, fixing your sight
With his high iron voice causing sickness
He is playing you out with delight
Man who do you just think you are?
A silly bum with seven stars
Don't throw the key or you will see
Dimensions cruel as they can be
Don't let him suck off your power
Throw the key...! Throw the key...! Throw the key...!

An earthquake, squirting fire, bursting ground
Satan's screaming, and the earth swallowing him away!

You're the Keeper of the Seven Keys
You locked up the Seven Seas
And the Seer of Visions can now rest in peace
There ain't no more demons and no more disease
And mankind live up, you're free again
Yes the tyrant is dead, he is gone, overthrown
You have given our souls back to light
