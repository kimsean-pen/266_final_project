We left behind the busy crowd
So it seems we slow down
Meet me with a way out through the lies
Nowhere, going nowhere in the fake yellow light

Blame no one, blame no one

The feelings change so fast
Safety scares them away
I can't bring myself to say it, it's my own advice I need
Nowhere and then nowhere, living trapped inside the chase

Blame no one, blame no one (so blame no one, would you look in my eyes and)
Blame no one, blame no one

Our weakness is the same
We need poison sometimes

So take another drink with me

Blame no one, blame no one (so blame no one, could you look in my eyes and)
Blame no one, blame no one
