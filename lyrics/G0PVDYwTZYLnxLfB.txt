There goes my life
On the open road
Can I be alone?
I can understand you

There goes my light
How can you be sure?
I'll be going home
With everyone beside you

I can understand you
I can understand you
I can understand you

Oh, can I get the window down?
It's getting warm
Oh, can you keep your voices down?
I'm tryna push the car

There goes my life
On the open road
I'll be going home
I can understand you

There goes my life
Can I be alone
I'll be going home with
I can understand you

Oh, can you leave the window down?
It's getting warm
Oh, can you keep your voices down?
I'm tryna push the car

Oh, can I get the window down?
It's getting warm
Oh, can you keep your voices down?
I'm tryna push the car
