Careful where you stand now, boy
Everything has changed
Got to search and destroy
Everything is strange

Got to move, stop the dreams
All protection gone
Listen how the people scream
On and on and on

Time to get away from here
You won't see me shed a tear
No time to say goodbye

Danger in the dead of night
Takes away the strength to fight
All we know is black despair
Heartbreaker

You remember what you said
In the first attack
Stand your ground, fight your best
Drop 'em in their tracks

Now the story changed again
Sing a different song
Listen how the shots ring out
On and on and on

Time to get away, my dear
There's no future for us here
Say a prayer and fly

Horror from the break of day
Make a strong man turn away
All we know is black despair
Heartbreaker

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

All the lights are dying now
See the shadows fall
Nearly all the people gone
Soon their rights 'n' all

Running through the ruins
All directions wrong
Listen to the world scream out
On and on and on

Time to get us outta here
No emotion, only fear
Say a last goodbye

Monsters at the edge of time
Waiting 'til we cross the line
All the find is black despair
Heartbreaker

Foul things reach out for blood
Never does a bit of good
All we find is black despair
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
