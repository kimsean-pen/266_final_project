Help me understand or take me as I am
I'll change my point of view, anything for you
Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew
Darling, can't you see something deep inside of me
I'm gonna change your mind and say that you'll be mine
Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew

Wipe away those tears and please don't be upset
Tell me all your fears, this I will address
Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew, me and you
Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew, me and you
Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew, me and you
Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew, me and you

Yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah

Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew, me and you
Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew, me and you
Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew, me and you, me and you, me and you
