I got a shadow and he wants me to complain
Our loves thinner than he wanted me to feel
Now I'm fighting hunger, swallowing on scars
Throw me under, tell me what you want
Cause I, I want to love, I want to love, I want to love
I want to love, I want to love, I want to love
I want to love, I want to love I want to love
I want to love, I want to love, I want to love
I want to love, I want to love, I want to love
Everybody told me it was bad to do
I know my reasons, I won't prove myself to you
I'm not the one you should be playing with
I'll tell you what, I won't behave myself again
No, no, I'm never gonna
No, no, I'm never gonna
No, no, I'm never gonna
I'm never gonna learn
I'm never gonna learn
I made a promise to deliver all the crimes
I don't belong to anybody else's lives
I will take your hunger, give you what you want
Pull you under, I will do you harm
Cause I, I want to love, I want to love, I want to love
I want to love, I want to love, I want to love
I want to love, I want to love I want to love
I want to love, I want to love, I want to love
I want to love, I want to love, I want to love
Everybody told me it was bad to do
I know my reasons, I won't prove myself to you
I'm not the one you should be playing with
I'll tell you what, I won't behave myself again
No, no, I'm never gonna
No, no, I'm never gonna
No, no, I'm never gonna
I'm never gonna learn
I'm never gonna learn
I'm never gonna learn
