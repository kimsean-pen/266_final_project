What pain throws
I go winding black tone
I stuck my face out of the wind
My cheeks were pink like buck tone
I know I'm living and I feel alive
Right ever moment, grace as it's aligned
I tried, yes I tried
To feel happy inside
But happiness hides from me
And I feel like my eyes are not darken
Blue eyes, feel alive, 'cause surprise I feel

And I don't care
I don't care
I don't really care
I don't care

The heart's slow and in darkness we sat
And don't let? Go
I felt your angry by my back
I know I'm living and I feel alive
Right ever moment, grace as it's aligned
I tried, yes I tried,
To feel happy inside
But happiness hides from me
And I feel like my eyes are not darken
Blue eyes, feel alive, 'cause surprise I feel

And I don't care
I don't care
I don't really care
I don't care
