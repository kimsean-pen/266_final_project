I believe in self-assertion
Destiny is like diversion
Now it seems I've got my head on straight

I'm a freak without provision
Seems I've made the right decision
Try to turn back now, it might be too late

And it's off to the morning and back again
Same old day, same situation
The happiness is back as if to say

I wanna stay home today
Don't wanna go out
If anyone comes to play
Gonna get thrown out
I wanna stay home today
Don't want no company
No way
Yeah, yeah, yeah

A simple life's my cup of tea
I don't need nobody but me
What I wouldn't give just to be left alone

I wanna be a millionaire someday
And know what it feels like to give it away
Watch me march to the beat of my own drum

And it's over and over and over again
Same old day, same situation
The happiness is back as if to say

I wanna stay home today
Don't wanna go out
If anyone comes my way
Gonna get thrown out
I wanna stay home today
Don't want no company
No way
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Rain, rain every day
Everyone would just stay away now
Come another day
Come another day

(Musical Break)

I wanna stay home today
I wanna stay home today
I wanna stay home, stay home, stay home, stay h-

I wanna stay home today
Don't wanna go out
If anyone comes to play
Gonna get thrown out
I wanna stay home today
Don't want no company
No way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna stay home
Don't wanna go out
If anyone comes my way
Gonna get thrown out
I wanna stay home today
Don't want no company
No way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
