It amazes me how much I want you
We seem to fall out every time
And again when I feel that we're closing in
You say "Look I really can't pull this off, not this time"

What's with all these people?
Who are they?
What do they want?
I don't carry drugs in my pocket
Though you said it would bring us closer
I don't think you meant to each other
But to something else
Someone else
