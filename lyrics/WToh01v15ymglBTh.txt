No blame, no praise
Half a mind, skim milk taste
Quarter to what's sustained
Six in the second place
Brand loyal permanent carmine
O say, can you see?
Wash your mouth out
Witness endlessly
Falling short on the inside
Prices rising in royal blue
Divine the original form
Tease it out for the afternoon
In the glow of the shape that's thrown (up! up!)
Wrapped away in the cellophane
I see through
Reach out with the give and take
Give and take
No future, no fate, no (no, no!)
As though, as though, as though, as though
As though, as though, as though, as though
As though, as though, as though, as though
As though, as though, as though, as though
But yet, but yet, but yet, but yet
But yet, but yet, but yet, but yet
But yet, but yet, but yet, but yet
And so, and so, and so, and so
No future
No fate
No future
No fate
No future, no fate
No future, no fate
No future
No future, no fate, no
No charm, all grace
Machine in me
Running out of space
Listless entropy
Lull me fast asleep
Tame the cells
Spin the silver
Vanguard gestation beachfront
Garment of vivid pink
Feel your teeth turn in
Television flicker over me
And breathe
Trace emission
Shower over me
Staring back
Just to look the other way
Another way
No future
No fate
No future
No fate
No future
No fate
No future
No future
No future, no fate
No future, no fate
No future
No fate
No future, no fate
No future, no fate
No future
No future, no future, no!
