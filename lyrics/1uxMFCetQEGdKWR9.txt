I don't ever want to meet you
'Cause you're like porcelain
And I think it would crack
If I found you were a brat
Stay perfect
Stay perfect
I don't ever want to meet you
'Cause you're like porcelain
And I think it would crack
If I found you were a brat
Stay perfect
Stay perfect
Nothing as disappointing
And I don't want to be disappointed
I'm just some kid you'll think about maybe in passing
But you're like my passion for real
But distance is a lot less stress
How you do what you do's still an uneducated guess
And I bet you'll think I'm crazy
But I think you're just a little bit amazing
Maybe, maybe I want to be you baby
No, I simply can't resist my imagination
Now I'm amount of patience
Validates my preoccupation
Let me say this
You look better famous, yeah
I don't ever want to meet you
Because you're like porcelain
And I think it would crack
If I found you were a brat
Stay perfect
Stay perfect
Ahem
Dear superhero, whom I look up to from afar
'Cause you're of a whole other galaxy
I know you might find this shit so bizarre
I rather we never had to meet, had to speak
I think I know who you are in my imagination
But not too sure about reality
You're a superstar, with that glow one has to be
But you come across brighter in a magazine
Shine much more on a plasma screen
If that don't wake me like a bad dream, bad dream
Sad scene like Mufasa in that stampede
Exactly why this calls for my evacuation
Before this conversation paints the picture
That my mind has painted
Faded
'Cause it can get complicated to recognize your idol's tainted
Damn, is that a face lift?
'Cause you look better famous
I don't ever want to meet you
Because you're like porcelain
And I think it would crack
If I found you were a brat
Stay perfect
Stay perfect
I don't ever want to meet you
Because you're like porcelain
And I think it would crack
If I found you were a brat
Stay perfect
Stay perfect
Have you ever met somebody who was perfect 'til you met them?
Woah, oh oh
Have you ever met somebody who was perfect 'til you met them?
I have
I don't ever want to meet you
Because you're like porcelain
And I think it would crack
If I found you were a brat
Stay perfect
Stay perfect
I don't ever want to meet you
Because you're like porcelain
And I think it would crack
If I found you were a brat
Stay perfect
Stay perfect
I don't ever want to meet you
Because you're like porcelain
And I think it would crack
If I found you were a brat
Stay perfect
Stay perfect
I don't ever want to meet you
Because you're like porcelain
And I think it would crack
If I found you were a brat
Stay perfect
Stay perfect
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
