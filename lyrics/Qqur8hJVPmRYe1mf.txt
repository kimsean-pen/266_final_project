(dreams, dreams, dreams)

I am known to stay awake
(a beautiful world I'm trying to find)
A beautiful world I'm trying to find
(a beautiful world, I'm trying to find)
I've been in search of myself
(a beautiful world) a beautiful world
It's just too hard for me to find
(dreams, dreams)
Said it's just too hard for me to find
(dreams, dreams)
I am in the search of something new
(a beautiful world I'm trying to find)
Searchin' me,
Searching inside of you
And that's fo' real

What if it were no niccas
Only master teachers?
I stay woke (dreams dreams)
What if there was no niccas
Only master teachers?
I stay woke (dreams dreams)
What if it was no niccas only master teachers now?
I stay woke (dreams dreams)
(what if there was no niccas only master teachers now?)

Even if yo baby ain't got no money
To support ya baby, you

Even when the preacher tell you some lies
And cheatin' on ya mama, you stay woke
(I stay woke)
Even though you go through struggle and strife
To keep a healthy life, I stay woke
(I stay woke)
Everybody knows a black or white, there's
Creatures in every shape and size

Lovers holding hands
And falling deep in love
And sleeping and
Passing conversation

Pretty rings and pretty thieves
With shiny lights and little
Pieces of tomorrow
