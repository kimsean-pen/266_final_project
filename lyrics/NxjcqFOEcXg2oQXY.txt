Good morning, mister
Good morning, sister
I've been gone for quite some time
And now you can decide

If I look any older,
If I stand any taller,
If I've seen the sun in weeks
If my voice is deeper, see
I'm a different person
Than I was before
Something that time can do

I've got cooler shoes on
And a nicer coat
And things that you can't steal

It's a good morning, mister
It's a good morning just for
All the finer things in life
It's not so black and white

It's a good morning, mister
It's a good morning just for...
It's a perfect day to be alive
It's a perfect day to be alive

It's a good morning, mister
It's a good morning just for
All the finer things in life
It's not so black and white

It's a good morning mister
It's a good morning just for...
It's a perfect day to be alive
It's a perfect day to be alive
