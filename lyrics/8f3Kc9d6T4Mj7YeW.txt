Hello
Woe me
The end is near
Thought you'd never leave
Heart and teeth

Just to taste bittersweet
One last stain to get beneath the skin
Beneath the skin

The wish is drawn inside
The neverending sigh
No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
My exit, no exit
No one lets everyone in

Me and you
Draw the line
Now it's time to move
Face to face

Damn the luck, blessed be
Heaven, what's come over me?
The wishes come inside
The neverending sigh

No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
My exit, no exit
Go on let everyone in
No one lets everyone in
(In, in, in)

No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
My exit, no exit
Go on let everyone in
No one lets everyone in
(In, in, in)
