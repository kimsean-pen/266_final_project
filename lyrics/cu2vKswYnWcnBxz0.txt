For a long time I've been gone
A wanderer with nowhere to go, babe
I spent too much time, I've been sprung
A sinner, free to roam, babe
I've been homeless, hopeless with no address
'Til my heart, you chose
Now I got a home, baby
Out here in the world I'm not alone
As long as I've got you, I've got a home
If you just don't let go so I don't feel the cold
As long as I've got you, I've got a home
These four walls, they can't hold me like you do
You already know, babe
And I'll just fit my life inside you
Taking you everywhere I go, babe
I've been homeless, hopeless with no address
'Til my heart, you chose
Now I got a home, baby
Out here in the world I'm not alone
As long as I've got you, I've got a home
If you just don't let go so I don't feel the cold
As long as I've got you, I've got a home
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go
Out here in the world I'm not alone
If you just don't let go so I don't feel the cold
As long as I've got you, I've got a home
Baby lonely, lonely, lonely, now I got a home
