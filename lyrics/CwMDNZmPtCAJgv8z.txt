Shadows are falling, and I've been here all day
It's too hot to sleep, and time is running away
I feel like my soul has, turned into steel
I've still got this scars, that the sun didn't let mw heal
There's not even room enough, to be anywhere

And it's not dark yet, but it's getting there

Well, my sense of humanity, has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing, there's been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter, and she wrote it so kind
She put down in writing, what was in her mind
I just don't see why I should even care

And it's not dark yet, but it's getting there

Well, I've been to London, and I've been to gay Paris
I've followed the river, and I got to the sea
I've been down to the bottom, of a world full of lies
Ain't looking for nothing, in anyone's eyes
Sometimes my burden, is more than I can bear

And it's not dark yet, but it's getting there

I was born here, and I'll die here, against my will
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still
Every nerve in my body, is so naked and numb
Can't even remember what it was, I came here to get away from
I don't even hear a murmur of a prayer

And it's not dark yet, but it's getting there

Sometimes my body is more than I can bare
And it's not dark yet, but it's getting there
