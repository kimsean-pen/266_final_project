I wanna cut me free, you wanna make believe
I'm made of flesh and bone, you wanna take control of me
You wanna dress me up, I wanna feel the sun
You wanna play pretend, I'm not about to bend, you'll see

This is not a game

You want the strings so you can
Pull at my soul and tear me down
You want it all, I'm not your marionette doll
So let me go

I'm taking back the day you tried to steal from me
I'm going to make my voice, you'll never get my choice to breathe

This is not a game

You want the strings so you can
Pull in my soul and tear me down
You want it all, I'm not your marionette doll
So let me go

Whoa, me go
Whoa

I wanna cut me free but you want make believe

This is not a game
You want the strings so you can
Pull at my soul and tear me down
You want it all, I'm not your marionette doll
So let me go
You want the strings so you can
Pull in my soul and tear me down
You want it all, I'm not your marionette doll
So let me go
