Phil she cried, please take me for your wife
I'll give you what you want, it will be alright
I'll give you a family and a home of our own
But he wasn't ready to settle down

Alone, alone
She cries she'll get you, she'll tantalise
Alone, alone

I'll meet you later, he gave her a ring
We'll meet at the park gates
The excitement in her head was so untrue
But she didn't know the truth

Alone, alone
She cries she'll get you, she'll tantalise
Alone, alone

She cries alone

She cries alone in the dead of the night
Just waiting for phil, but he never came
She'll see you, but you won't see her
She's waiting, she'll get you she will tantalise

Alone, alone
She cries she'll get you, she'll tantalise
Alone, alone
