Everyday I fight for all my future somethings
A thousand little wars I have to choose between
I could spend a lifetime earning things that I don't need
But that's like chasing rainbows and coming home empty

And if you strip me, strip it all away
If you strip me, what would you find?
If you strip me, strip it all away
I'll be alright

Take what you want
Steal my pride, build me up or cut me down to size
Shut me out, but I'll just scream
I'm only one voice in a million, but you ain't taking that from me

You ain't taking that from me
(You ain't taking that from me)
You ain't taking that from me
You ain't taking that

I don't need a microphone
To say what I've been thinking
My heart is like a loudspeaker
That's always on 11

And if you strip me, strip it all away
If you strip me, what would you find?
If you strip me, strip it all away
I'm still the same

Take what you want
Steal my pride, build me up or cut me down to size
Shut me out, but I'll just scream
I'm only one voice in a million, but you ain't taking that from me

No, you ain't taking that from me
You ain't taking that from me
(You ain't taking that from me)
You ain't taking that

'Cause when it all boils down at the end of the day
It's what you do and say that makes you who you are
Makes you think about it, think about it, doesn't it?
Sometimes all it takes is one voice

Take what you want
Steal my pride, build me up or cut me down to size
Shut me out, but I'll just scream
I'm only one voice in a million, but you ain't taking that from me

No, you ain't taking that from me
You ain't taking that from me
(You ain't taking that from me)
You ain't taking that
Take what you want
Steal my pride, build me up or cut me down to size
Shut me out, but I'll just scream
I'm only one voice in a million, but you ain't taking that from me
No, you ain't taking that from me
You ain't taking that from me
(You ain't taking that from me)
You ain't taking that
