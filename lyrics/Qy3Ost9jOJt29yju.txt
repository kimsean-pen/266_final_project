God give me strength to recover
God give me strength, overcome
God put together something good for me
That can't be undone
Hand on the good book survival
Hand shading eyes from the sun
Hand in hand down that dirty road
We can't be undone
No it's number 1

How many times and how many crimes
No pill to break the fever
How many more will walk through the door
Turn doubter to believer
When you're alone
Say a little prayer for me

Hey there Mr. Pilot
Will you fly me to your hill?
And I will start the riots
I will teach them how to kill
When we finally get to heaven
Absolved of all our sin
We will know how many angels
On the head of a pin

I prayed like I thought I was dying
Prayed when I didn't believe
Prayed all the time on the dirty road
With no reprieve
Faith, drug of choice for the sinner
Hope was the reason outdone
Trust in me, we are hand in hand
We can't be undone

How many times and how many crimes
No pill to break the fever
How many more will walk through the door
Turn doubter to believer
When you're alone
Say a little prayer for me

Hey there Mr. Pilot
Will you fly me to your hill?
And I will start the riots
I will teach them how to kill
When we finally get to heaven
Absolved of all our sin
We will know how many angels
On the head of a...

Low, fast and mean we were killing the dream
Came the roar of the pipes and a banshee scream
And man held stop, didn't know what he mean
So we burned on by, we were singing mean green

Everybody said, that they knew him well
He was a man of god but you really couldn't tell
If the deal was real or if the angel fell
But we were singing mean green on the way to hell

Tear this place to the ground
Stone and dust lay all around
Don't you say exactly where you been
Dance with the angels on the head of a pin

Hey there Mr. Pilot
Will you fly me to your hill?
And I will start the riots
I will teach them how to kill
When we finally get to heaven
Absolved of all our sin
We will know how many angels
On the head of a pin
On the head of a pin
On the head of a pin
On the head of a pin
