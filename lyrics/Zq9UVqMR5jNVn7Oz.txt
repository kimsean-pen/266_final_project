You think I don't know, but I know
What you're doin' (What you're doin' to me)
Took me awhile, but now I see
What you've been pushin' (what you've pushin' on me)

I know you from back in the day
I gave you my trust, but I gotta push you away
I can feel it - you want me to be your clown
Now it's time I show you how it's goin' down

You think I don't know, but I know
What you're doin' (What you're doin' to me)
Took me awhile, but now I see
What you've been pushin' (what you've pushin' on me)

I gave my love so easy and free
You took my emotions
Now get away from me
Things have changed
I know you are
Oh, I know you are

You think I don't know, but I know
What you're doin' (What you're doin' to me)
Took me awhile, but now I see
What you've been pushin' (what you've pushin' on me)

Stop it, baby
Stop doggin' me around
Stop it, baby

You think I don't know, but I know
What you're doin' (What you're doin' to me)
Took me awhile, but now I see
What you've been pushin' (what you've pushin' on me)
Baby
You been pushin' so long
I
(You think I don't know)
But I'm so weak for your love
(You think I don't know)
I don't know
(You think, you think I don't know)
I don't know
You think I don't know, but I know
You think but I know, but I know
Baby
What you're doin' to me
