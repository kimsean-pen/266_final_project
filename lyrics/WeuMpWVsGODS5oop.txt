Used to make food stretch so I don't need to eat
Used to fucking struggle just to meet rent's meet
When you see a dead body, that's life on the streets
Where the strong will survive and you die if you weak
Two fuckin' bottles in my hands, never had that
Smoking on a motherfucking ounce, never had that
Real shit, never had a bitch 'til I rapped facts
Spinning on the track, you a bitch, better bounce back

Fuck an assumption, you don't know me
Look like Halloween, but ain't shit sweet
No tricks, no treats
Yo bitch on me
I could finesse, but I got weed to roll instead, yes
I got blunts and Hennessy
Shawty give sloppy head to me
Bodies droppin' regularly

Can't stop gettin' to the check, my G
Can't stop, even just to flex, my G
That sounds crazy in the head, my G
I don't need to rest 'til I'm dead, my G
OmenXIII, black shirt, black jeans
If you know me, gotta keep it low-key
Sleep through the day, in the night when I creep
I don't chase the money 'cause the money come to me

Life ain't free, people gotta pay fees
Pull up in yo city, got an ounce for the free
Everybody know that I'm hot, on me
I'm the wifi plug, hot-spots on me
If you drive by, don't miss a shot on me
OmenXIII, got the blade on me
2017, but the music still free
I don't fuck with labels but the labels want me

Riding down Melrose any day of the week
Tell me what it means when every day just be a weekend
Tell me what you want, what you need, can't talk long
'Cause I'm on the flight headed to the next time-zone
Tidal wave coming through fast like the Bible
Psycho, running through these checks like a track meet
Athlete, pushing on this weight like a madman
Damn, man, hit my fucking line, "what's the plan, bro?"
Rambo, creepin' through the grass like these snakes do
Fake moves, breakin' rappers ankles like I'm Hot Sauce
Bob Ross, speakin' and I'm paintin' the picture
Scriptures, every single song I've ever written

Fit in, something that I never really did, bitch
Something that I never really did, bitch
Fit in, something that I never really did, bitch
Something that I never really -- yeah
