As I walk along these streets
I see a man that walks alone
Distant echo of people's feet
He has no place to call his own
A shot rings out from a roof over head
A crack head asks for change nearby
An old man lies in an alleyway dead
A little girl lost just stands there and cries

What would you do (what would you do)
If it was you (if it was you)
Would you take everything for granted like you do?

A boy just thirteen on the corner for sale
Swallows his pride for another hit
Overpopulation there's no room in jail
But most of you don't give a shit
That your daughters are porno stars
And your sons sell death to kids
You're so lost in your little worlds
Your little worlds you'll never fix

What would you do (what would you do)
If it was you (if it was you)
Would you take everything for granted like you do?

You turn away
You turn away
You turn away
You turn away

As I walk along the streets
Soaking up the acid rain
Underneath the taxi cabs
I hear the streets cry out in vain

What would you do (what would you do)
If it was you (if it was you)
Would you take everything for granted like you do?
What would you do (what would you do)
If it was you (if it was you)
Would you take everything for granted like you do?
