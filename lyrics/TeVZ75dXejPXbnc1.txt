Gravity's my enemy
It grabs on me like I'm on E
The stars are banging close to me
As I'm floating in the life Odyssey

My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in space Odyssey
My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in space Odyssey

Like puzzle bubble on PC
It's got color waves following me
And I still judge it week by week
And I'm ahead of time, so you never lose me

My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in space Odyssey
My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in space Odyssey

Can I take a minute or two
To introduce my point of view
I need to spend some time with you
There's nothing more new on the news

My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in space Odyssey
My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in space Odyssey
