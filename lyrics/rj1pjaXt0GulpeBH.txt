If getting what you want
Means losing what you've got
You better think it over

Cause you're losing quit a lot
Hey baby, won't you settle down for me?

Well you believe in what you see
And I do believe you do
But seeing is believing.

If it's all the same to you
Hey baby, stop your fooling round for me.

I wanna know.
Won't you tell me?
I'm tired of these pieces and bits
I wanna know.
Now tell me.
Before it hurts where it is.
Before real.
Or let's call it quits.

Listen

Making it with me
Means giving up on her, yeah
No more double dealing, no more digin' in the dirt
No baby,
Don't you mess with me no more!

I wanna know.
Won't you tell me?
I'm tired of these pieces and bits
I need to know.
Please tell me.
Before it hurts where it is.

Ohhh, I need to know
Please.
I'm tired of these pieces and bits
I need to know.
Please tell me.
Before it hurts where it is.

Before real.
Or let's call it quits.
Before real.
Or let's call it quits.
