Baby
Why you not home yet
Baby it's getting late
I wish you would be home by now.
Door bell rings
Who could it be at this time
Police on my left and right
My son's not coming home tonight

Baby, they don't need to show
It's over, I know, I know
Baby, they don't need to show
Flowers and football tops, I know
Baby, baby, baby, why you?

No sweeping exits
No Hollywood endings
Flowers and football tops
Don't mean a thing.

My baby is six feet under
Just another number
My daughter without her brother

Baby, they don't need to show
It's over, I know
Baby, they don't need to show
Flowers and football tops, I know

My baby is gone...

(You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy
When skies are grey
I hope you noticed
How much I loved you
How could they take my sunshine away)
