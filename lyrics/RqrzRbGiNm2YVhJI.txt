Ooh ooh oh
The selfish part of me needs for you to stay
'Cause girl you keep a smile stretch across my face
And I would give anything now
But you would lose everything now
The way your lips move when you say my name
The smell of your hair on my pillow case,
And I would give anything now
But you would lose everything now
If I'd had it my way I'd never let you walk out the door
And my heart is heavy with something that I just can't ignore

Girl, I'm sitting here wondering what it is that we've done
Baby who am I to be that other guy?!
'Cause I've seen tables turned, a world of hurt
I'd never wanna feel twice,
I know what it's like from the other side
So baby who am I to be that other guy?!

This could be our home girl, a special place
Something much more than your great escape
Girl I would give anything now if you didn't had everything now
It doesn't have to be that you feel the same
You're telling me your love for me would never change
Unless you change everything now it doesn't mean anything now
If it's him that you've chosen, then we need to stop closing the door
'Cause while he's at home waiting, then we can't pretend there's something more

Girl, I'm sitting here wondering what it is that we've done
Baby who am I to be that other guy?!
'Cause I've seen tables turned, a world of hurt
I'd never wanna feel twice,
I know what it's like from the other side

Ooh oh, I know it's not an easy choice to make
Ooh, 'cause no matter what you do
A heart will break
Girl, I'm sitting here wondering what it is that we've done
Baby who am I to be that other guy?!
'Cause I've seen tables turned, a world of hurt
I'd never wanna feel twice,
I know what it's like from the other side
So baby you decide who is that other guy?!
'Cause baby, who am I to be that other guy?!
