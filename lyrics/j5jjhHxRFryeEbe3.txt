When everything was broken
The Devil hit his second stride
But you remember what I told ya
Someday I'll need your spine to hide behind
For fear of moments stolen
I don't wanna say goodnight
But I'll still see you in the morning
Still know your heart and still know both your eyes

I could've told you 'bout the long nights
How no one loves the birds that don't rise
So you can tell the heroes go hide
My sense of wonder is just a little tired

But if only you could see yourself in my eyes
You'd see you shine, you shine
And I know you'd never leave me behind
But I am lost this time
Are we destined to burn, or will we last the night?
I will hold you til I hold you right
If only you could see yourself in my eyes
You'd see you shine, you shine

We'll run into the open
Keep your hand inside of mine
And when everything is over
I hope to think of this as better times
The sky got red and swollen
I guess I never see the signs
There can't be songs for every soldier
There can't be solace every time you cry

I could've told you 'bout the long nights
How no one loves the birds that don't rise
So you can tell the heroes go hide
My sense of wonder's just a little tired

If only you could see yourself in my eyes
You'd see you shine, you shine
And I know you'd never leave me behind
But I am lost this time
Are we destined to burn, or will we last the night?
I will hold you til I hold you right
If only you could see yourself in my eyes
You'd see you shine, you shine

I was lost 'til I found you
Now these songs will hold and hide your name
All at once was all about you
Since that night the moon has never seemed the same

If only you could see yourself in my eyes
You'd see you shine, you shine
I know you'd never leave me behind
But I am lost this time

With the love you deserve this love you never find
I've learned in love and death we don't decide
If only you could see yourself in my eyes
You'd see you shine, you shine
