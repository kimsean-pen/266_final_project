Let me off
We can all mistake a, all mistake a heart
It's hard enough
Oh, I'm tripping up, I'm tripping in the dark

So you're heathen
You don't believe in love
Am I beaten
If I believe in us?

Into the black
Where I'm falling, oh, I'm falling paralyzed
Just take me back
Oh, how will I get out this time?
How will I get out this space? Your design

So you're heathen
You don't believe in love, you don't believe, no
Am I beaten
If I believe in us? If I believe in

So you're heathen
You don't believe in love
You don't, you don't

Now I'm beaten
'Cause I believe in us
You know, you know

I wanna know what you feel
I wanna know what you feel
Would you be like me?
Would you be like...
I wanna know what you feel
I wanna know what you feel
Would you be like me?
Would you be like...

So you're heathen
You don't, you don't
You don't believe (Heathen)
Finally

Oh, I believe
Oh, I believe
Oh, I believe
Oh, I believe
Oh, I believe
Oh, I believe
