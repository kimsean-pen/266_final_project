Looks like I fucked up
'Cause I let you fall in love
And I let me fall in love
Even though I shouldn't of
Had to let you go
I could see what's down the road
Never knew just how
But if I could tell you, I would tell you now

In a way I've been doomed
Since the day that I met you
In a way I'm a fool
For wasting all my time with

You've got starry eyes
You're my favorite waste of time
I've got starry eyes
You're my favorite waste of time

Don't know what to say
'Cause I'll lose you anyway
Push to see if I will stay
But it's more than I can take
In another life
Maybe I could do you right
Take a chance for you
Never did but now it's all I wanna do

In a way I've been doomed
Since the day that I met you
In a way I'm a fool
For wasting all my time with

You've got starry eyes
You're my favorite waste of time
I've got starry eyes
You're my favorite waste of time

In a way I've been doomed
Since the day that I met you
In a way I'm a fool
For wasting all my time with

You've got starry eyes
You're my favorite waste of time
I've got starry eyes
You're my favorite waste of time

I've got starry eyes
I've got starry eyes
I've got starry eyes
You're my favorite waste of time
