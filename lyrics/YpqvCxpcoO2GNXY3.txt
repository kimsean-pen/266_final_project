Bent backwards
Followed the part of the hair
Bangs brushed the surface
Back broke in two

Sinking, sinking

And the ocean pulled
And the ocean pulled
And the ocean pulled
The body into the earth
Sand pouring into lungs
And the ocean pulled

Dripping
Dripping
Dripping
Like an hourglass

Pulling
Pulling
Pulling
Like quicksand

Gasping, calling for help
And suddenly you don't know nothing
