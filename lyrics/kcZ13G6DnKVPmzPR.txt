Don't turn around, keep going
If I do look back, I'll never get over you
Any ounces of doubt, don't show them
In this ancient game we're playing, it's never lose.

Why did it fail? For what reason?
How many times, and whom must I ask to know?
Just a long way around or a dead end?
Bound for a place I could only reach alone
