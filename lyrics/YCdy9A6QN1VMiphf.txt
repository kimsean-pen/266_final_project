Saw you walk in to the room
Thought i'd try to talk to you
Babe, am i ever glad you wanted me to
Its been two years to the day
half the time I've been away
I know I'm not there enough
but that's gonna change
cause I'm coming back
to show you that
I'm keeping the promise that i made

When i'm with you
I'll make every second count
cause i miss you, whenever you're not around
when i kiss you
i still get butterflies
years from now
I'll make every second count
when I'm with you

(na na na na na nananananana)
(na na na na na nananananana)

yeah we've had our ups and downs
but we've always worked them out
babe am i ever glad we got this far now
still i'm lying here tonight
wishing i was by your side
cause when i'm not there enough
nothing feels right
so i'm coming back to show you that I'll love you the rest of my life

when i'm with you
I'll make every second count
cause i miss you, whenever your not around
when i kiss you
i still get butterflies
years from now
i'll make every second count
when i'm with you
whatever it takes

im not gonna break the promise i made
when i'm with you

I'll make every second count
cause i miss you
when i'm with you

I'll make every second count
cause i miss you, whenever your not around
when i kiss you
i still get butterflies
years from now
i'll make every second count
when i'm with you (na na na na na nananananana)
when i'm with you (na na na na na nananananana)
when i'm with you (na na na na na nananananana)
when i'm with you (na na na na na nananananana)
(nananananana)
