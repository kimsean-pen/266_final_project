Deny
You're such a liar
You won't know the truth if it hit you in the eye
Deny

You're such a liar
You're selling your no-no all the time
An' you said we were going out to the 100 Club
Then you said "it ain't my scene"

Then you turned up alone
Then you turned up alone
Deny
You're such a liar

You won't know the truth if it hit you in the street
Deny
You're such a liar
You're selling your no-no all the time

Then said you'd given it up
Gone an' kicked it in the head
You said you ain't had none for weeks
Baby I seen your arms

Baby I seen your arms
Deny
You're such a liar
You won't know the truth if it hit you in the eye
Deny

You're such a liar
You're selling your no-no all the time
Do you think I'm a raving idiot?
Just got off the boat
Step in line, sign this form

Baby ain't got a hope
You ain't got a hope
Deny
You're such a liar

Deny
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies
Let's hear it true love
You know like in the 12p comic

In a room filled with screams
A-With ice cream
A boy meets girl
Somebody gets run over

Oh, everybody cry
But I don't know why
I'm a fool, I can't be cool
I've read one to many books

I believe everything I read
When it's written in the slush-filled paper
Deny
You're such a liar.
