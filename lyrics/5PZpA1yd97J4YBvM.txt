I am the ghost in the shadows
I am the fear of the dark
I am the murderer of apathy
An angel that's fallen

I am the psycho the sinner
I am what you can't escape
I am the splinter underneath your skin
I am a monster

With a bang
I feel my heart start to separate
The enemy within
Can no longer be contained

I'm running from myself
There's something inside of me
And it's ripping a hole through my chest

I spit the fire from my lungs
The creature I buried
Is now the beast that I've become
We pretend that we can be somebody else
But heaven's judgments nothing when
You're already in hell

So take these broken wings
They'll just slow me down
(I'll never be the same, I'll never be the same)
And take my fragile heart
They'll just tear it out
(This is the end of broken me)

They call me to the lights

I am the ghost in the shadows
I am the fear of the dark
I am the murderer of apathy
The angel that's fallen

I am the psycho the sinner
I am what you can't escape
I am the splinter underneath your skin
I am a monster

I feel so god damn tired
And I can't escape the things I've lost
The cycle repeats and repeats
And I can't turn the fucking power off

I hate the things that I'm not
And I'm sick of how this has to end
I tried to reason with you
But now all of you are fucking dead

I am the living dead
I am the living dead
I walk through hell alone
And none of you can save me now

So take these broken wings
They'll just slow me down
(I'll never be the same, I'll never be the same)
And take my fragile heart
They'll just tear it out
(This is the end of broken me)

Come into the light
Their voices just like thunder
They call me to the lights
But I am already gone, what have I done?

I am the ghost in the shadows
I am the fear of the dark
I am the murderer of apathy
An angel that's fallen

I am the psycho the sinner
I am what you can't escape
I am the splinter underneath your skin
I am a monster
