I saw your flash smile
That seemed to me to say
You wanted so much more than casual conversation
I swear I caught a look
Before you turned away
Now I don't see the point
Resisting your temptation

Did you come on to me
Well I come on to you
If you come on to me
Well I'll come on to you

I don't think I can wait like I'm supposed to do
How soon can we arrange a formal introduction?
We need to find a place
Where we can be alone
To spend some special time
Without an interruption

If you come on to me
Well I'll come on to you
If you come on to me
Well I'll come on to you

Before you grab your coat
I'll try to be discreet
You know we can't be seen
Exchanging information

Well, I saw your flash smile
That seemed to me to say
You wanted so much more than casual conversation

If you come on to me
Then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me
Then I'll come on to you

If you come on to me
Well I'll come on to you
If you come on to me
Well I'll come on to you

If you come on to me
Then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me
Then I'll come on to you

If you come on to me
Then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me
Then I'll come on to you

Yes I will
Yes I will
Yes I will
Now

Yes I will
Yes I will
Yes I will
Now

(Aha)
(If you)
If you come on to me
Then I'll come on to you
If you come on to me
Then I'll come on to you

Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Ye-eh-ye-ye-ye-yeah

Yeah

Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah
