Well you got some high class baby
Steppin' all over me
With your high tone
And your blue line
Respectability
You go down on the corner
Havin' yourself a ball
Changed your way of livin'
And I don't know you at all

I can't let you do it
I can't let you do it to me
I know you're gonna do it
But
I can't let you do it to me

If the sun don't shine no more
And the blue sky don't appear
If the rainfall don't fall no more
I really don't think you'd care
You got so wrapped up baby
In everything you do
Been putting on the dog
You know
And I mean you

I can't let you do it
I can't let you do it to me
I know you're gonna do it
But
I can't let you do it to me

If you don't shut down
Miss banquet
If you don't shut down
Real soon
Gonna find yourself
Out on the street
Looking for another room
You're seen me on the corner
Having myself a ball
Gonna change my way of living
And you won't know me at all

I can't let you do it
I can't let you do it to me
I know you're gonna do it
But
I can't let you do it to me
