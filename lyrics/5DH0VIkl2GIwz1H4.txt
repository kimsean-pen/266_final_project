You promised you could never take what's mine
You told me love was never hard to find
The way you cross your legs the stockings really blow my mind
There she goes again

I told I could never be your man
Unless you gave me everything you can
But even then you know I'll never be satisfied
Because there's nothing like starting over

She swears she's never coming back again
Until she comes running over
She's gonna swear she's never coming back again
And maybe she's right

Said you loved me enough to let me go
Did you forget the nights that went so slow?
We'd fight until there were no words and all the tears were dry
Then we'd just forget

But now I see you clearer than before
The way we used to laugh and so much more
Wish I could take it back wish I knew how to make it right
Because there's nothing like starting over

But she swears she's never coming back again
Until she comes running over
She's gonna swear she's never coming back again
And maybe she's right

You're more than a face in the crowd
(Never coming back again)

There's nothing like starting over

But she swears she's never coming back again
Until she comes running over
She's gonna swear she's never coming back again
And maybe she's right
