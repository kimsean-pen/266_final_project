Were a radia gunslung
Were a murdream boys room
On a slight of jadeself
Are you tied of drying, rounder?

Dimed a thousand cycles
Come around to meet we
Holding each folding
How are you keeling, rounder?
Were a rounder too
Were a rounder too
Were a rounder too
Were a rounder too

Plant a seed to vulture
Damned to returning
Who married the widow
Were a round man turning, rounder?

Hostess of November
Were the horses clodding
On slick embers going
Past the gamblers odding, rounder
Were a rounder too
Were a rounder too
Were a rounder too
Were a rounder too
