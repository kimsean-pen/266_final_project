Nervous and your tearing at the seams
The lights are too bright and you've got cold feet
You look the part and you're only seventeen
Can you drag me up and show me what we're missing out on

Don't waste your time
We've heard it all before
We've had enough and hangers on and "friends" we didn't want
Don't waste you're time
We've heard it all before
We've had it up to heels and head and we won't take no more

You're a star but you haven't been turned on
Think you can shine this way
This way the whole way to the top
OH oh oh
Are you sure it's what you want?
Call it luck
Call it too much

Don't waste your time
We've heard it all before
We've had enough and hangers on and "friends" we didn't want
Don't waste you're time
We've heard it all before
We've had it up to heels and head and we won't take no more

The truth is a terrible thing
Don't you think?
The truth is a terrible thing
Don't you think?
