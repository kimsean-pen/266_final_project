we're fighting again, more than usual
try and pretend that this is normal
but it isn't right, the damage that we do to your body
all those scratches on your little arms are spelling
"i'm sorry about bein' me: skinny, less perfect oprah winfrey."
sleep on the couch, just say when
bring me a cat, to be my best friend
'cause it isn't like you ever said
that you were committed to the thought of me, and only me
but he hasn't written you in seven weeks
that's when i come in
and it isn't like you ever said that i was your hobby
i can't believe i spent a morning tryna tell u i'm sorry about yesterday
when u would have done the same
grow you like my hair, cut you off when i get scared
if everyone in class stares, you don't care, you don't care
grow you like my hair, cut you off when i get scared
if everyone in class stares, you don't care, you don't care
grow you like my hair, cut you off when i get scared
if everyone in class stares, you don't care, you don't care
grow you like my hair, cut you off when i get scared
if everyone in class stares, you don't care, you don't care
