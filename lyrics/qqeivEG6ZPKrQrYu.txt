Simple minded brain, for now you succumb
Nothing changes your way
This world insists to be the same
Based on our mistakes
The flowers fade along the road
Don't blindfold your eyes
So loneliness becomes the law
Of a senseless life

Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride to get there
Go!

Now you have to face another day
You won't be alone
This life is forcing us to stay
For how long?
Cold is the wind and thunder struck
On a stormy night
But can't you see, I'm by your side
We are marching on!

Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride to get there

So, carry on
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past, to carry on

Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride to get there

So, carry on
There's a meaning to life (carry on)
Which someday we may find
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past

So, carry on
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past

Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past to carry on
Remains from past, to carry on
Remains from past!
