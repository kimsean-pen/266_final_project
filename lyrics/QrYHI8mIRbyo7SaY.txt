Take a seat next to thy devil.
Reach and grasp beneath my skin.

See my fate.
Wreck a lifetime.
Gain my heart.
Kill my visions.

In those days I denied you for every second.
And now I can't accomplish anything.
Still got so much more to give in this life.
I guess I'm heading for regrets.

Once I sold my soul.
That's one sweet regret.
