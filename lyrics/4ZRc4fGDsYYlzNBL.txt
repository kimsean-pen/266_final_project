Grandma' welcome home... You have
been gone for far too long
Is this a dream, are You really back?
Let me help You out of the chair...
Grandma'
Let me touch You, let me feel... Ahhh
Grandma' take a look
What do You think of the house and
the silvery moon?
We are going to repaint the front door
soon
Let me help You out of the chair...
Grandma'
Let me touch You, let me feel... Ahhh
Wait till You see Your room up in the
attic
Prepared just like You said, without a
bed
You will find Your rocking chair and
the tea pot that Missy found
Let me help You out of the chair...
Grandma'
There is someone waiting for You,
now come along
Missy and Mother, they are dying to
meet You
How strange... she's spoken no word...
I wonder Grandma'! Are You all right?

Grandma' what was it like to be on
that holiday site
"Oh it could have been worse but
with "THEM" by my side
In the twilight "THEY" sang all the old
lullabies"
Grandma' who are "THEY"... "never
mind You dirty little brat"
"Let us go inside, something's on
"THEIR" mind
"THEY" are still alive, can You feel
"THEIR" eyes
Can You feel "THEIR" eyes?
Now that You are stuck with me You
better be my friend.
