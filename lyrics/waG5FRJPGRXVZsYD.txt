where did you go, and what did you do, with all that time you were too scared to move?
what is it like to be by yourself for three and half years.
for roughly three and a half years.
if we could just pretend that i went to college, and that's why you haven't seen me.
i wanted to go, but not for this long.
i overdid it.
why did you say that i was one in a million?
because i believed it.
i thought i had something that you were too scared to lose.
so if we could just pretend that i went to college, and traveled abroad, and did something different.
anything but just sitting at home for three and a half years, writing song after song after song.
so what is it like to be by yourself and feel like you'll die around everyone else.
i thought i was one in a million.
well thanks for nothing.
thank you.
thank you.
