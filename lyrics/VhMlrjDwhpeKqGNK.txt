Children are taught to hate
Parents just couldn't wait
Some are rich and some are poor
Others will just suffer more

Have you ever been ashamed
And felt society try to keep you down?
I begin to watch things change
And see them turn around

Turn around
They'll try to keep you down
Turn around, turn around
Don't drag me down

Ignorance like a gun in hand
Reach out to the promised land
Your history books are full of lies
Media-blitz gonna dry your eyes

Have you ever been afraid
And felt society try to keep you down?
I begin to watch things change
And see them turn around

Turn around
They'll try to keep you down
Turn around, turn around
Don't drag me down

Ignorance like a gun in hand
Reach out to the promised land
Your history books are full of lies
Media-blitz gonna dry your eyes

You're eighteen, wanna be a man
Your granddaddy's in the Ku Klux Klan
Taking two steps forward and four steps back
Gonna go to the White House and paint it black

Turn around
They'll try to keep you down
Turn around

Turn around
They'll try to keep you down
Turn around
Don't drag me down
