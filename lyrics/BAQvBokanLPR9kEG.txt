Read my lips, I don't want to get involved with relativity
Take my time, use it wisely, you're controlling certain gravities

You're comin' around so late in the day
I've been here before, I know what to say

You're moving the ground, you're making me feel
As if the universe is you, the universe is you
The universe is you, the universe is you

Tell yourself, you can't have me, I rely on probability

You're comin' around so late in the day
I've been here before, I know what to say

You're moving the ground, you're making me feel
As if the universe is you, the universe is you
The universe is you, the universe is you

You're comin' around so late in the day
I've been here before, I know what to say

You're moving the ground, you're making me feel
As if the universe is you

You're comin' around so late in the day
I've been here before, I know what to say

You're moving the ground, you're making me feel
As if the universe is you, the universe is you
The universe is you, the universe is you

The universe is you, the universe is you
The universe is you, the universe is you
The universe is you
