Blood was like paste on the walls
Bodies lay lifeless like dolls
A moment that felt like days
Lives extinguished in a rage
So nauseous, I don't realize
Incessantly feeding the flies
In the moment of visceral haze
The last thing you see are my crazed eyes
The last thing you see are my eyes

Fears lies beneath your facade
In panic you scream for your God
No way I'll ever abstain
Blood falls from the ceiling like rain
Patiently unleash my violence
Ingesting the sweet sound of your silence
In darkness this feeling I love
To be covered in blood

Blood from above

This violence finally sets me free
Brings demons back to torture me
There's no god pulling at my strings
I'm above all sorrow faith can bring
Disengaged I see your face
An adrenaline rush I can't replace
Hands around your neck, your senses numb
Staring into your eyes
When the stillness comes
