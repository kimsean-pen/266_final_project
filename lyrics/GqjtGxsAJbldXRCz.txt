Reckless and weary
The truth has been buried
Held down by the hand
That refuses to carry
The burden you built
The lies, do you hear me?
The insult, the white flag
You refuse to carry
I'm letting you go
And all that you showed me
I'm letting you know
That you don't control me
The feeling is cold
And life is unfolding
Reckless and weary
I'm desperately holding on

So if you can't get a word in
It's because I don't care what you think
Don't be alone inside
A world that's filled with make-believe

Broke! Inside
This life, you can never be reborn within
I came this far, erase my scars
Fight! This time
Inside, take a break from the lie you live
I came this far, erase my scars

Find my control
Find reasons to beat this
Find truth below
The lies and the wreckage
I can't let go
I'm too close, too restless
I'm letting you know
I'm far too aggressive

So if you can't get a word in
It's because I don't care what you think
Don't be alone inside
A world that's filled with make-believe

Broke! Inside
This life, you can never be reborn within
I came this far, erase my scars
Fight! This time
Inside, take a break from the lie you live
I came this far erase my scars

Erase my scars

Five years ago
My life was affected
By years of hope and learning life lessons
You let me know
By leaving me helpless
What then is unknown was now unprotected, I'm so

Broke! Inside
This life, you can never be reborn within
I came this far, erase my scars
Fight! This time
Inside, take a break from the lie you live
I came this far, erase my scars

Erase my scars
Broke inside
Broke inside
Broke inside
