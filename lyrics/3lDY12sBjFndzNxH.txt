Sleep next to me
Tell me everything is how it should be
When we wake I'll beg you not to leave
Tell me there are promises not meant to keep

And your hair will smell like smoke
Because you are a ghost
I won't hold you hand
Because you'll disappear

Sleep next to me
Tell me everything is how it should be
When you leave to haunt someone else's dreams
Think of me

Just know I'll never leave
Just know I'll never leave
Just know I'll never leave
Just know I'll never leave

Sleep next to me
Tell me everything is how it should be
When you leave to haunt someone else's dreams
Think of me

Sleep next to me
Tell me everything is how it should be
