So watch out,
You're in danger.
You never know it,
But you know that it's possible.
Your name,
The way it looks
Carved into the cover of the telephone book.
I don't care.
I'm never gonna.
It sounds better when you're high on marijuana.
Yeah right, in my head.
Yeah right, am I right in my head?
So watch out.
You're in danger.
You never know it,
But you know that it's possible.
Like old friends,
Who never asked,
"How can you be happy when you wear all black?"
And they care
Because they wanna.
It feels weird,
Like a really weird movie,
All night, in my head.
All night, in my head.
So watch out,
You're in danger.
You never know it,
But you know that it's possible.
Schley,
Schley,
Schley,
Schley.
