I could find you in the desert
Find you on the forest floor
I could find you in a nightclub
But I don't go there anymore

Can we put it to bed?
Or can we put it to rest?
I'm too tired tonight
I'm going to sleep outside
With all my

All my strange
Strange creatures
All my strange
Strange creatures

You said you'd leave us for a minute
But you left us for a couple of weeks
By the time you came to find us
We'd forgotten how to speak

Can we put it to bed?
Or can we knock it on the head?
When you turn out the lights
I'm going to play outside
With all my

All my strange
Strange creatures
All my strange
Strange creatures
All my strange
Strange creatures
All my strange
Strange creatures

All my strange
Strange creatures
All my strange
Strange creatures
All my strange
Strange creatures
All my strange
Strange creatures
