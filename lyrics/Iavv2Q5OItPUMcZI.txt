Every night I say a prayer
Look at me, nobody cares
Just a mirror, passing by...
Looked inside
I've lost my pride

Stay with me not for so long
It's alright, no needs, no hope
Such a miracle,
looking back...
Times gone by,
and life wasn't bad

Lord, light my way
Fill these withered,
careless hands...

Oh, skies are falling down
Skies are falling down
Oh, skies are falling down
Skies are falling down

See, the birds are back...
At the docks and everywhere
Here in Lisbon, realized
This whole world
so strange and divine

Lord, light my way
Fill these withered,
careless hands...

Oh, skies are falling down
Skies are falling down
Oh, skies are falling down
Skies are falling down
