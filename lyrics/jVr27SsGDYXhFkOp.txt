There's a road out here
(There's a road out here)
It's a pleasure to drive
(It's a pleasure to drive)
My little sleepy head
(My little sleepy head)
My treasure, don't you hide
(My treasure, don't you hide)
The ocean will return
(The ocean will return)
The mountains move aside
(The mountains move aside)
And though every journey is mine
(Every journey is mine)
Let your grace go wild
(Let your grace go wild)
To see the KIM CHEE TACO MAN
In the white Sudan
The KIM CHEE TACO MAN
The KIM CHEE TACO MAN
Korean Mexican
Play the drum again
Play the drum again
The KIM CHEE TACO MAN
The KIM CHEE TACO MAN
The KIM CHEE TACO MAN
(Ah, ah)
You know the smile is real
It's something you can feel
The stars with twisted teeth
Not so out of reach
(Ah, ah)
