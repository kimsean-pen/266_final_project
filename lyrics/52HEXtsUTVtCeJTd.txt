This is a call to arms, will you stand beside me?
This is our time to fight
No more compromising
And this blackened heart will sing
For sad solidarity

Halo over our demise
Following a god so blind
Sallow in their sickening
Swallow not, the shit they feed

This is a right to life, not Religious Right's act
This is abortion's knife
Aiming at the womb of
The Christian conspiracy
So open thine eyes and see

The halo over our demise
Following a god so blind
Sallow in their sickening
Swallow not, the shit they feed

Our time will come
Our time will come
Our time is now
Our time is now

And I won't pray for you
And I won't pray for you
And I won't pray for you

Halo
Follow
Sallow
Swallow
Halo over our demise
Following a god so blind
Sallow in their sickening
Swallow not, the shit they feed
Set me free

Your words will never hold us down
Prayers won't be spared on you
Satisfaction denied
'Til you're dead and gone
Gone
Dead and gone!
You're gone!
You're gone!
