You say you've been waiting, waiting for someone,
Waiting for some song, waiting since you were born
For a moment when everything's alright,
And everything's all white, but I just can't wait anymore

Hey Paul where have you gone? I wanna come along
Hey Paul what went so wrong? What went so wrong?

Have you gone away or been left behind,
You know that I don't mind, you know that you're my kind,
'Cuz when I hear churchbells or when I see fireflies,
You know that I don't lie, one of these days you'll belong

Hey Paul where have you gone? I wanna come along
Hey Paul what went so wrong?
Hey Paul where have you gone? I wanna come along
Hey Paul what went so wrong? What went so wrong?
