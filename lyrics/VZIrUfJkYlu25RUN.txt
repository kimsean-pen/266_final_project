Dawn breaks evenly today
On the truth and the lie
All rise, court's in session
We're hanging someone high

Justice means nothing today
Now that the courts are for sale
Pick a crime from the menu; pick a sentence and defend you
And pay up the down payment called bail
The system's for sale

Kick the chair, the rope is tight
Just like one quick wrench, the tooth is out
Friend or foe, I've got to hang them dead
Or they'll come back around

Kick it! The court's wrong when it keeps track
Of victories and defeats
The press that never rests just waits
For somebody's soul they can eat

Justice means nothing today
Now that the jury's for sale
Guilty or not, the verdict's a lie
You're going to jail
The system has failed

Kick the chair, the rope is tight
Just like one quick wrench, the tooth is out
Friend or foe, I've got to hang them dead
Or they'll come back
