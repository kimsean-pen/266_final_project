Lost dreams not forgotten
They lie just beyond fear
Held down by corruption
Never be controlled by fear
Shatter the sky, shatter the sky

Without failure we cannot evolve
We will rise from the fall
With your back against the wall
We will rise above them all
Shatter the sky, shatter the sky

Failure is not fatal
Through struggle we fight, survival
Success is not final
Shatter the sky, shatter the sky (skybreaker)

(I will not fade) Failure is not fatal
Through struggle we fight, survival
Success is not final
Shatter the sky, shatter the sky (I will not fade)

Lost dreams not forgotten
They lie just beyond fear
Held down by corruption
Shatter the sky, shatter the sky

Failure is not fatal
Through struggle we fight, survival
Success is not final
Shatter the sky, shatter the sky

Failure is not fatal
Through struggle we fight, survival
Success is not final
Shatter the sky, shatter the sky
(Shatter the sky, shatter the sky)
(Shatter the sky, shatter the sky)
(Shatter the sky, shatter the sky)
(Shatter the sky, shatter the sky)
