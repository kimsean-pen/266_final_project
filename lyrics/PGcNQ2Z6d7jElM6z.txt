Come down off your throne
And leave your body alone
Somebody must change

You are the reason I've been waiting so long
Somebody holds the key
Well I'm near the end
And just ain't got the time
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home

Come down on your own
And leave your body alone
Somebody must change

You are the reason I've been waiting all these years
Somebody holds the key
Well I'm near the end
And just ain't got the time
Oh, oh, and I'm wasted
And I can't find my way home

But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
Still I can't find my home
And I ain't done nothing wrong
But I can't find my way home
