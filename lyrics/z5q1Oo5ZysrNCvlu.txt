Why I should feel this way?
Why I should feel this way?
Why I should feel the same?

Is something I cannot say
Is something I cannot say
Is something I can't explain

I feel you
Outside at the edge of my life
I see you
Walk by at the edge of my sight

Why I should follow my heart?
Why I should follow my heart?
Why I should fall apart?

Why I should follow my dreams?
Why I should follow my dreams?
Why I should be at peace?

I feel you
Outside at the edge of my life
I see you
Walk by at the edge of my sight

I had to let you go
To the setting sun
I had to let you go
And find a way back home

When I dream all I see is you
When I dream all I see is.
I never seen a light that's so bright
I never seen a light that's so bright
I never seen a light that's so bright
Blinded by the light that's inside
Blinded by the light that's inside
Blinded by the light that's inside you
