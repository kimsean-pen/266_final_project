As always I'm chasing my fears
brings me wisdom to see
that I'm lost in the years
my vision holds tight
and nothing's regained
greeting sunrise
and goodmorning restrict
I'm facing up for once and all
where mirrors help the fall
somewhere in the dusty clouds
I can hear myself call
In silence I find
that the hours won't mind
If the storm comes my way
I have dreamt of this day
embracing the truth
reach the end of your will
leave the cause of the fight
march on in to the night
when thinking of tomorrow
reminds you of the past
that warm the scouts of sorrow
It is coming
and fast
In every stand
despite you demand
you cannot control the turns
and every flame
the vision the same
raindrops that longs to burn
