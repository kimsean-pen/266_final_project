Sometimes I get impatient
But she cools me without words
And she comes so sweet and so plain
My hummingbird and have you heard
That I thought my life had ended
But I find that it's just begun
Cause she gets me where I live
I'll give all I have to give
I'm talking about that hummingbird
Oh she's little and she loves me
Too much for words to say
When I see her in the morning sleeping
She's little and she loves me
To my lucky day
Hummingbird don't fly away

When I'm feeling wild and lonesome
She knows the words to say
And she gives me a little understanding
In her special way
And I just have to say
In my life I loved a woman
Because she's more than I deserve
And she gets me where I live
I'll give all I have to give
I'm talking about that hummingbird
Oh she's little and she loves me
Too much for words to say
When I see her in the morning sleeping
She's little and she loves me
To my lucky day
Hummingbird don't fly away
