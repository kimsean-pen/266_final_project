I, I don't feel it anymore
Somehow I see clearer than before
I hold on to the bastian of life
I turn my back to the meaning of life
And the scene isn't my scene anymore
I dug too deep and was crawling on the floor
It's what you make and the people you love
The more I burn the less I've got to show

What's calling me now is
Jumping in line at the store
Keep racin' ahead there's
No value in the score

Grind your teeth
And cut off all your sleeves
A few good rifs
And a sticky bag of cream
You said therefore
It's not as bad as it seems
A corner kid gets to live out all his dreams
No self control
You keep singin' through the screams
When you let go it's closer than you think

There are colors in the places you can't find
It's a way of (way of) saying goodbye
It's a way of (way of) saying goodbye
It's a way of (way of) saying goodbye

There are colors in the places you can't find
It's a way of (way of) saying goodbye
It's a way of (way of) saying goodbye
It's a way of (way of) saying goodbye
