I love to move here... Wooo! I love to move in here
I love to move here... Wooo! I love to move in here

I love to move here... Wooo! I love to move in here
I love to move here... Wooo! I love to move in here

Okay...
This is how it's gonna go...

Y'all gonna move till ya can't no more
The DJ gonna pick up records till his hands are sore
The lights are gonna flash
For grand masta cash
Gonna kick it to you like you never heard before
The place is here
The time is now
All the fellas say ho
All the ladies say ow.
Put your two hands togetha
To form a so clap
And jump back never see you ride the track
It ain't black or white
It's about the beat
If you can't rack the mic
It's about the heat
You say what you're like
When I'm about to speak
And nobody wanna hear you anyway
So keep it moving girl (girl)
So old skool takin' it back
And we ain't leaving
Till we stop breathing
Even if the music stops
We continue to groove
Nice and smooth
Because we want y'all to move

I love to move here... Wooo! I love to move in here
I love to move here... Wooo! I love to move in here

I love to move in here (Old skool takin' it back again)
