I just want a shallow girl
Save your morals for him
Save your morals for someone who can swim
I just want a shallow girl
No I can't give you tomorrow
But I can give you tonight, and a memory for the rest of your life
You fuckin' shallow girl
(No I can't give you tomorrow)
(But I can give you tonight, and a memory for the rest of your life)
(You fuckin' shallow girl)
I won't want you tomorrow
Because tomorrow is complicated
Tomorrow doesn't always come
I can't give you tomorrow but I can give you tonight
A memory for the rest of your life
You fuckin' shallow girl
(I won't want you tomorrow)
(Because tomorrow is complicated)
(Tomorrow doesn't always come)
Save your morals for him
Save your morals for a love deep enough to swim
I just want a pond
You shallow girl
I just want a shallow girl

Ummm

Save your morals for someone who can swim

But I can give you tonight, and a memory for the rest of your life
You fuckin' shallow girl
