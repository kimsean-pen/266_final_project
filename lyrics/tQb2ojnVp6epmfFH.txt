You've got me thinking about it.
Don't know my way around it.
Got me wishing I could say the things I don't.
See, I was traveling; the mess that we were in
could only make me wanna stay out on the road.
But when the trust falls, missed phone calls
long live the problem child.
But I think I'll stay a while.

Now I don't think I'll ever
feel like this again.
I'll never feel.
We're suspended in time
from the likes of you
but I'm willing to prove

you've got more fight left in you.

We're suspended in time

from the likes of you.
Yeah, it's true.
So you can take it from me
I just wanna be more than a memory.
(You've got me thinking about it.

Impeccability is what you said to me.
See, I was busy trying to figure out
what it is that you were talking about.
Don't think I'll ever feel like this again.
I'll never feel.
We're suspended in time
from the likes of you
but I'm willing to prove
you've got more fight left in you.

Yeah, it's true.
So you can take it from me
I just wanna be more than a memory.
It's hard enough for me to say this.
Easy enough when you're the faceless.
It's impersonal.
I just thought you should know.
