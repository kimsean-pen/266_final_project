My instinct was to flee from home
Closure,
I will
find you in due time.
In sleep, you go where you want to go.
In love, you see what you want to see.
I want to go, and I want to see.
Grind me into dust to feel my skin crumbling.
Feed me to the sea to hear my lungs stumbling.
Oh Siren's song,
take me home where the stones can cover me
When your time runs out,
and when your blood runs cold, stay strong.
When your lungs give in,
and the world caves in, be calm.
Alone,
tall grass and open skies-
that's where I'll be
(that's where we'll meet)
