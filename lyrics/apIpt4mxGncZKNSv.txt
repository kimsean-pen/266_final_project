She says I need you now
But I don't know why
She's got this fairytale
But that's just not mine

And I drink and smoke too much
She doesn't mind
But I know it's best for her
If I said goodbye

And I think I've said it
I know that I did

Wish I could bite my tongue
without tasting the blood
Of your broken heart my love
Wish I could
Wish I could bite my tongue without tasting the blood
Of your broken heart my love
Wish I could
(Ohhhh)
But it's too late, too late, too late
But it's too late, too late, too late

I call you every night
Cause I know that's what you want
But I got this poision touch
And this won't last long

And I think that I've said it
I know that I did

Wish I could bite my tongue
Without tasting the blood
Of your broken heart my love

Wish I could
Wish I could bite my tongue
Without tasting the blood
Of your broken heart my love

Wish I could

But it's too late, too late, too late
But it's too late, too late, too late

She says I need you now
But I don't know why
She's got this fairytale
But that's just not mine

And I think I've said it
I know that I did

Wish I could bite my tongue
Without tasting the blood
Of your broken heart my love

Wish I could
Wish I could bite my tongue
Without tasting the blood
Of your broken heart my love

Wish I could

But it's too late, too late, too late
But it's too late, too late, too late
