Like cigarettes and gasoline
I light a match and watch this scene
Burn away in front of me
Ashes of my misery

I swear sometimes I think this life is killin' me
I swear sometimes I think this life is killin' me

I swear it's killin' me
All our shattered hopes and our long dead dreams
The wreckage that we all try to keep
From coming to life and tearing us apart at the seams

Sun bleached bones and withered trees
Slowly rotting just like me
Empty bottles broken glass
My resolve is fading fast

I swear sometimes I think this life is killin' me
I swear sometimes I think this life is killin' me

I swear it's killin' me
All our shattered hopes and our long dead dreams
The wreckage that we all try to keep
From coming to life and tearing us apart at the seams

I swear sometimes I think this life is killin' me
I swear sometimes I think this life is killin' me
I swear sometimes I think this life is killin' me
I swear sometimes I think this life is killin' me

I swear it's killin' me
All our shattered hopes and our long dead dreams
The wreckage that we all try to keep
From coming to life and tearing us apart at the seams
