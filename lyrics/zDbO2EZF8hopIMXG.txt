you think I'm still the same
in every single way
but I changed
you think i need something
to make this go away
but i changed
and i feel this way
i feel this way alone
and i feel this way
i feel this way alone
and you're gone
but you're gone
but you're gone
you're gone
things i'll never say
keep them tucked away
cause i changed
and the things you want to hear
they all disappear
they're not here
and i feel this way
i feel this way alone
and i feel this way
i feel this way alone
and you're gone
you're gone
you're gone
you're gone
do i belong
do i belong
do i belong
do i belong
and you're gone
and you're gone
and you're gone
and you're gone
and you're gone
and you're gone
yeah, you're gone
