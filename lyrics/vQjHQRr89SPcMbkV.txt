Now ain't no one perfect that we on earth with
But why buy if it ain't worth it?
Girls that's worthless I can't purchase

Perky on top, soft as a nerf is

Girl we could be superfriends, ha
Girl we could be superfriends, ha
Ooh baby baby baby

Ooh baby baby baby

You get wiped out instead of getting wifed up
But we could cut if you're trying to get knifed up
