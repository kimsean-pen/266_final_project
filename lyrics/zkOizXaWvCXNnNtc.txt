I hear the ticking on the clock
Counting everyday I've been alone
How long before you're coming back?
If I don't see your face, I'll turn to stone

Can't keep holding on this way
Can't go on another day
Can't you hear me when I say...

Chorus:
Girl I'm hungry, for your love
Girl I'm hungry, baby let me in
Hungry, for your love
Hungry, I can't get enough

Your love's the color of my heart
When I look in your eyes, everything's so clear
So still together when we're apart
I begin to die unless you're here

Can't keep holding on this way
Can't go on another day
Can't you hear me when I say...

Chorus:
Girl I'm hungry, for your love
Girl I'm hungry, baby let me in
Hungry, for your love
Hungry, I can't get enough

I lie awake all night
Can't stop remembering
You've got to make it right
I can't hold it in

Solo

HUNGRY!

I hear the ticking on the clock
Counting everyday I've been alone...
Hungry

Chorus:
I'm hungry, for your love
Girl I'm hungry, I can't get enough
Hungry, for your skin
Hungry, baby let me in
Hungry, for your love
Hungry!
I'm hungry, for your love
Hungry... Oh no!
Hungry!
