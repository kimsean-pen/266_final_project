Black and blue I chose my wave
I, the candid castaway
In a way delayed
By one more broken season
To find reason for appeasing you

And so I found my guiding light
lambent, flashing red and white
Through a starry night
I'm better nowhere bound
Than drowning on your solid ground

Satellite, save my life
I'm wishing on a two-way radio
Love might be just like me
Jaded waiting all alone
A whisper on a two-way radio

All in all I fare the same
Wishing on an aeroplane
As calling stars by name
A lonely song of freedom rings
In hope of someone listening
And so I send my feeble flare
Through the silent, arctic air
Heading anywhere
Until at last I've finally found
A place to lay my anchor down

Satellite, save my life
I'm wishing on a two-way radio
Love might be just like me
Jaded waiting all alone
You never know never ever

Heaven help me
I'm drowning and I can't save me
Send some salvation
To keep me alive

Satellite, save my life
I'm wishin on a two-way radio
Love might be just like me
Jaded waiting all alone
Satellite, save my life
I'm wishin on a two-way radio
Love might be just like me
Jaded waiting all alone
A whisper on a two-way radio
