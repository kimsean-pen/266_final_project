Stay, stay, stay, stay

I thought you would be around forever
No matter where I would go
So I started taking you for granted
Forgot what I used to know

Guess I sold my soul, just to have some fun
Think I lost myself trying to be someone
I gave you the blade, looked the other way
Never thought it would drive you away

If I could turn back time and change my life
Get another chance to make things right
If I had one more word to say to you
I let you know, I want you to

Stay, stay, stay, stay

I have learned a lesson of a lifetime
Won't be myself again
I forgot the things that really mattered
And lost it all in the end

Never told the truth, kept it all inside
Got you thinking there's something I'm trying to hide
Knew I needed change, but I stayed the same
Never thought it would drive you away

If I could turn back time and change my life
Get another chance to make things right
If I had one more word to say to you
I let you know, I want you to

Stay, stay, stay, stay

In my dreams we are still together
Everything is like one big, happy ending
I'm right there, I found my way home now
It's too good to be true, and then I wake up
Like a ghost

I thought you would be around forever
No matter where I would go

If I could turn back time and change my life
Get another chance to make things right
If I had one more word to say to you
I let you know, I want you to

Stay, stay, stay, stay
I want you to
Stay, stay, stay, stay
