You were born with a
Smile on your face
And it's been there everyday
When you cry I remind you
That I'm never gone away
But I'm here by your side
Until you send me away
When you're a hundred
Thousand years
You say till then I have to stay

And when we walk
Out hand in hand
And you tell me about your day
Nothing else matters
But all you have to say
And when you wake up far too early
It's your chance to start again
And I don't know what will happen
But I know I want to stay

And if the light turns to darkness
And your face might turn away
When your words don't
Sound sweat anymore
I'll listen to what you say
And when you're
Pushing me and telling me
I still won't walk away
Yes I don't know what will happen
But I know I have to stay

Cos that's what love is, darling
I'm here as long as you need
When you show you're
Okay on your own
I'll smile and leave
Cos that's what love is, darling
I'm here as long as you need
When you show you're
Okay on your own
I'll smile and leave
I'll smile and leave
