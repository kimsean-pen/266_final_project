There never was a better love
To see the light of day
If only just to lift you up
And rise above the grey

It breaks my heart, but now you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you I'll still be there

My growing pain, my darkest days
I owe them all to you
For every break I've got you to thank
For always pulling me through

If it breaks your heart, at least you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you I'll still be there

But if the world should let you down
And the sky should fall and never make a sound
And if it all disappear
I promise you I will be there

It breaks my heart, it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart, it breaks my heart

But now you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there

But if the world should let you down
If the sky should fall and never make a sound
Oh if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there

And if it all disappears
You have my word I will be there

And if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there
