I'm so settled down
It feels like the Earth moves
When I do

So, still (so still)
I'll sit (I'll sit)
For you
Until (until)
I can't (I can't)
Not move

Did the bed shake?
The house just fell down
The city's in ruins
Did you feel that, too?

I'm not mad, I'm done
That last earthquake
Was a knockout punch

I'm bored again
Torn between giving in and getting lost for good
The silence sits in my throat
What time is it?

The bed shook
And the house just fell down
The city's in ruins

Now they're all dead, or buried
I'm sorry, but I had to move
