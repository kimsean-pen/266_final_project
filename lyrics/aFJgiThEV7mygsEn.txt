In the night I look for love
Endless strength from the man above
God of piston, God of steel
God is here behind the wheel
I'm just working for the man
For love

Pretty things get in my car
Take them flying, it's not far
Take in handsome, take in me
Look good in my steel machine

I'm just working for the man

Don't you know yet who I am?
Working harder for the man
Go around and doing good
Get my strength from the man above
I'm just working for the man
I'm just doing what I can
Go around I'm doing good
Go around I'm doing good
Go around I'm doing good
Go around I'm doing good
Go around I'm doing good
Go around I'm doing good
