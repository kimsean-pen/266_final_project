I'm a little shy
But I know you know
I've done this too much
'Cause I been alone

I'm feeling this devotion
Touching your emotion
I can see the love run right out of you
Moments like these are golden
Never felt so open
Even if I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming with you

So breath my air, and kiss me there

'Cause I'm a little cold but
I'll warm up with you

Out of my chest when you put it there
Yeah I'm a little cold but

I've warmed up with you
Woooo ohhhhhh ah ha ha haaa yeah
Woooo ohhhhhh ah ha ha haaa yeah
Woooo ohhhhhh ah ha ha haaa yeah
Woooo ohhhhhh ah ha ha haaa yeah
I don't care too much for valentines
I just need your skin next to mine
I'm feeling this devotion
Touching your emotion
I can see the love run right out of you
Moments like these are golden
Never felt so open
Even if I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming with you
So breath my air
And kiss me there
'Cause I'm a little cold but
I'll warm up with you
Out of my chest when you put it there
Yeah I'm a little cold but
I've warmed up with you
Woooo ohhhhhh ah ha ha haaa yeah
Woooo ohhhhhh ah ha ha haaa yeah
Woooo ohhhhhh ah ha ha haaa yeah
Woooo ohhhhhh ah ha ha haaa yeah
Woooo ohhhhhh ah ha ha haaa yeah
Woooo ohhhhhh ah ha ha haaa yeah
