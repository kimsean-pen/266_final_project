Nervous, nervous

I'm on a wire, my pulse running high
Don't know I'll fall or maybe I'll fly
This time it's right to try the unknown
It's dangerous, where do I go
You're making me feel so nervous

I'm so nervous baby
Can't you feel it
With my eyes blindfolded
I must follow you
I'm so nervous baby
You control me
It's getting hard to hide it
You know I like it

I breathe your kiss, the words on your lips
I live to taste addiction like this
I'm scared again, I know I'll give in
It's dangerous, where do I go
You're making me feel so nervous

I'm so nervous baby
Can't you feel it
With my eyes blindfolded
I must follow you
I'm so nervous baby
You control me
It's getting hard to hide it
You know I like it

Shaking everytime I taste it, closer
I inhale it, always, need it, anticipation
Wondering what comes next, now I know I'm taken
You always make me nervous, nervous
Dwelling in corruption, focus on disruption
Can't help but shiver, swallow
I pretend to be strong, first time I discover
I am, nervous

Nervous, nervous

I'm so nervous baby
Can't you feel it
With my eyes blindfolded
I must follow you
I'm so nervous baby
You control me
It's getting hard to hide it
You know I like it

I'm so nervous baby
Can't you feel it
With my eyes blindfolded
I must follow you
I'm so nervous baby
You control me
It's getting hard to hide it
You know I like it

Nervous, nervous
Nervous, nervous
