Fear fun, fear love, fresh out of fucks forever
Tryin' to be stronger for you
Ice cream, ice queen, I dream in jeans and leather
Live stream, I'm sweet for you

Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane
We're American-made

Give me Hallmark
One dream, one life, one lover
Paint me happy in blue
Norman Rockwell, no hype under our covers
It's just me and you

Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane
We're American-made

Oh (yeah), oh (yeah), oh (yeah)
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss
Oh (yeah), oh (yeah), oh (yeah)
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss

Oh God, want you on my lips
It's me your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Soundin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

Oh, shatter oh, shatter, oh, shatter
(Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss)
Yeah (yeah), oh (yeah), oh (yeah)
(Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss)
(Yeah)

You heard my baby's back in town now
You should come, come over
We'll be hanging around now
You should come, come over

Oh God, I love him on my lips
It's me your little Venice bitch
Touch me with your fingertips
It's me your little Venice bitch

Back, back in the garden
We're getting high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
My baby crimson and clover

(La-la-la-la-la-la, losers, beautiful losers)
(La-la-la-la-la-la, losers, beautiful losers)
Wha-wha-wha-wha-whatever, everything, whatever
(Wha-wha-wha-wha-whatever, everything, whatever)

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah yeah, ah yeah
(La-la-la-la-la-la, losers, beautiful losers)
(La-la-la-la-la-la, losers, beautiful losers)
La-la-la-la-la-la, losers, (yeah) beautiful losers (yeah)
La-la-la-la-la-la, losers, (yeah) beautiful losers (yeah)
La-la-la-la-la-la, losers, beautiful losers

Back in the garden
We're getting high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
My baby crimson and clover

Crimson and clover, honey
Crimson and clover, honey
Crimson and clover, honey
Crimson and clover, honey
Crimson and clover, honey
Crimson and clover, honey
Over and over, honey
Over and over, honey
Over and over, honey
Over and over, honey
Over and over

If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
