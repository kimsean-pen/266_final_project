I am a country sleaze, nobody will mess with me

That man over there, he don't really care
He looks at me with that country stare

Touch my body, touch my soul
Touch that deep and disused hole

Well I'm disgusting, I'm ashamed of this so-called human race
And I am a country sleaze, wallers by me, a country tease

I am a country sleaze
Why are you not a country sleaze?
I am a sleazy country tease

I'm a country sleaze
Oh well, I am a country sleaze
