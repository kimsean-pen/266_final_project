Oh my love
we pray each day
may you come home
and be okay
for now we wait for you
for you to come home

I'll send a pack of cigarettess and some chocolates
hope you get
filled with love for you

Oh my love
Ihope really soon to be at home and get close to you
for now we'll wait
for some news
for some news to go home

My mind is always on your side
I see you all the time
