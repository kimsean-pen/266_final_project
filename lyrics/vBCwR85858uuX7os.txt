All this time, looking for a light
All this time, I'm still trying
I gave you all my love
I took it back again
But the candle in my heart
It flickers now and then

I knew it from the start
I knew it at the end
You said it never work
But I still think about you every now and then

And you're out of my heart
Swear I can't pretend
But the heart tears apart
As I still think about you every now and then
Every now and then,
Now, right then
Right now, right then, right now, right then

Never ever going back, I said I never would of care
It's better now that we're apart
But I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, about you every now and then
Now and then,
But I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, about you every now and then
Now and then,
But I still think about you every now and then

Never ever going back, I said I never would of care
It's better now that we're apart
But I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, about you every now and then
Now and then,
But I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, about you every now and then
Now and then,
But I still think about you every now and then

I even wore your ring, got under my skin
And you know why
You left me wondering,
You left the shadows there
And settled down the sins
But you can't hide
Cause ...
When I'm going, gets tough
You give me all that you got
But my heart won't beat again

Never ever going back, I said I never would of care
It's better now that we're apart
But I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, about you every now and then
Now and then,
But I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, about you every now and then
Now and then,
But I still think about you every now and then.

Never ever going back, I said I never would of care
It's better now that we're apart
But I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, about you every now and then
Now and then,
But I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, about you every now and then
Now and then,
But I still think about you every now and then
