All my wolves begin to howl
Wake me up, the time is now
Oh-oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh-oh, there's a revolution coming

Wide awake
The fever burns
Sweat it out
Bring my turn

Can you hear the drumming?
There's a revolution coming

All this doubt
Is creeping in
Inside out
Shed my skin

Can you hear the drumming?
There's a revolution coming

I been waiting all my life
To live when I've only been dreaming
Give love when I've only been stealing

Killing time
Keep passing me by
Run down what I've always been chasing
Block out everything I've been facing, facing

All my wolves begin to howl
Wake me up, the time is now
Oh-oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh-oh, there's a revolution coming
Vile things that turn me on
Drag my dark into the dawn
Oh-oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh-oh, there's a revolution coming

My body aches
I'm bound in chains
But there's a fire
In my veins, yeah

Can you hear the drumming?
There's a revolution coming

Like every king
Who lost the crown
And all those years
Are history now

Can you hear the drumming?
There's a revolution coming

I been waiting all my life
Run down what I've always been chasing
Block out everything I've been facing (facing)

All my wolves begin to howl
Wake me up, the time is now
Oh-oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh-oh, there's a revolution coming
Vile things that turn me on
Drag my dark into the dawn
Oh-oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh-oh, there's a revolution coming

There's a revolution coming
There's a revolution coming
Oh-oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh-oh, there's a revolution coming

I'm rising up
Up from the ground
From the bottom
Can't hold me down, hold me down

When I'm rising up
Up from the ground
From the bottom
Can't hold me down, hold me down
Hold me down-down, down-down

All my wolves begin to howl
Wake me up, the time is now
Oh-oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh-oh, there's a revolution coming
Vile things that turn me on
Drag my dark into the dawn
Oh-oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh-oh, there's a revolution coming

There's a revolution coming
There's a revolution coming
Oh-oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh-oh, there's a revolution coming
There's a revolution coming
There's a revolution coming
Oh-oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh-oh, there's a revolution coming
