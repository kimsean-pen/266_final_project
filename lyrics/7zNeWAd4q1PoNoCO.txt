Some days
I get crazed
I don't know why it's so irrelevant
I'll take deep breaths
And keep control, go on.

I've tried brave
And you've tried to save
I'm proud to keep it bottled up
I think I past my prime and lost my mind and I'm torn

There's no telling what tomorrow holds
Who let, who let this feeling die, when all I did was try?
Who let, you let this feeling die
I can't get you out of my head, my head

You're the flame that burns me so I know that I'm still alive.
Some say: "It's all fate"
But I say we control our lives
And if my destiny should out best me then that's fine
I make believe thrill and apathy co-exist in me fairly equally
But truth is doubts are all I've got, to call mine

No telling what tomorrow holds
No telling what voice takes control
Who let, who let this feeling die, when all I did was try?
Who let, you let this feeling die
I can't get you out of my head, my head.

And you're the flame that burns me so I know that I'm still alive
Is there anybody out there (anybody out there)
Is anybody calling (anybody calling)
What if what I say is really wrong?
Is there anybody out there (anybody out there)
Is anybody calling (anybody calling)
What if what you say is really wrong?
I'm not in control, I think I'm out of control
Who let, who let this feeling die, when all I did was try?
Who let, you let this feeling die
I can't get you out of my head, my head
You're the flame that burns me so I know that I'm still alive
