Sea waves turn green and grey and up to where they die
Rise others vaster yet to only swell and sigh
To fade in the morning sky, oh
They are the sea made land were brought to fishers' town
To cast out on a strand the men she could not drown
Fishermen from the town, oh

Fishermen are weary, brittle fearless men
Changing course, the wind folds them in it's own hands
Dunes are grim and dreary, boats in lifeless sands

Rise others vaster yet to only swell and sigh
To fade in the morning sky, oh

Fishermen are weary, brittle fearless men
Changing course, the wind folds them in it's own hands
Dunes are grim and dreary, boats in lifeless sands
