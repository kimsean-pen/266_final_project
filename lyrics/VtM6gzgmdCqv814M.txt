Spending my day, thinkin' 'bout you girl
Being here with you, being near with you
I can't explain myself
Why I, feel like I do (like I do)
Though it hurt me so, to let you know when I
Look in your eyes, and if you let me know
How you feel
Let me know, if this love is really real
But it seems to me
That I'm, wrapped up in your love

Don't you know that I'm
Still in love (Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey

Heaven knows that I'm
Still in love (Still in love, in love with you)
In love with you, hey
Hey hey, when I look in your eyes
Aw for all the years I, I see (I see)
Me lovin' you and you lovin' me
Well it seems to me
That I'm still wrapped up in your love

Don't you know that I'm
Still in love (Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey

I, I, I, I

Don't you know that I'm
Still in love (Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you
Hey I tried, in love with you, I, I
