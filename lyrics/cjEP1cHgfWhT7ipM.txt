I've been searching
The fossil that once was a fawn
I've been waiting
For the sun to rise up with the dawn

Sleeping for 21 hours a day
Fending the doctors away
Bleeding decay

Oooh,
sweet surrender
Collapse to my knees
Beg and plead
Fill me with everything

I threw this in the fire
Fuelled by my desires
Gave it all away
Led the flock astray
Bent and broken vine
Choking at the spine

Oooh,
sweet surrender
Collapse to my knees
Beg and plead
Fill me with everything

Oooh,
sweet surrender
Collapse to my knees
Beg and plead
Fill me with everything

I'm starting again
Tearing my flesh
Stripped to the bone
The all that I've grown
Leaving behind
Breathe like a child
It's taken the winter
To find who I am

I'm starting again
Tearing my flesh
Stripped to the bone
The all that I've grown
