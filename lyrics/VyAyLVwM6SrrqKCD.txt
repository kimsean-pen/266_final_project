I try to wrap my brain around this
The very fact that this could be the end
Staggering man, you could ruin everything, if you only knew the dance, yeah

We try to pick up all the pieces of our city
But you just turn away, in the blaze of grey.

Clearly I could see you giving up
And kills me to watch you turn your face on us
You just turned away

You looked back
But you were never the same
'Cause you step back when you had the chance to leave

But you still blame us like we did this
But you did cause our town has fallen under the sound

And I can't stand to watch you turn away
And clearly I could see right where you are

Systems disarmed
Waving your arms all the way down
Slipping under the sound again

I tried to hear the way it sounded
We died inside, when your body grounded,
Spilled across the floor, slipping under the shade,
They are here, you can't stop the sound,
Of the city falling under ground,
Of the city falling under ground,
You can't stop the sound,
You can't stop the sound (you can't stop the sound)
Of the city falling under ground,
Of the city falling underground

You looked back but you were never the same,
Cause you stepped back when you had the chance to leave

While the city is burning,
The shadow takes our lives with it,
The fire spreads like a plague,
While the city is burning,
The shadow takes our lives with it.

Takes our lives
With shame
