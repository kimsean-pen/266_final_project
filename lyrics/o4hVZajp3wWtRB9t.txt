Every day in the week I'm in a different city
If I stay too long, the people try to pull me down
They talk about me like a dog, talkin' about the clothes I wear
But they don't realize they're the ones who's square

Hey! And that's why
You can't hold me down
I don't want to be down
I got to move on

Stone free, do what I please
Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
I got to, got to, got to get away
Alright

Listen to this, baby
A woman here a woman there try to keep me in a plastic cage
But they don't realize it's so easy to break
Oh, but sometimes I get a ha, I feel my heart kind of runnin' hot
That's when I've got to move before I get caught

Hey! And that's why, listen to me baby
You can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down
I gotta be free, ow!

I said, stone free, do what I please
Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
Got to, got to, got to get away

Yeah, ow!
Tear me loose, baby

Stone free, to ride on the breeze
Stone free, do what I please
Stone free, I can't stay
Stone free, (I got to, I got to) I got to, I got to get away

Stone free, I'm gone baby, right now
Stone free, don't try to hold me back, ow
Stone free, I go on down the highway, yeah
Stone free, I got to, got to, got to, got to
Stone free, move it, bye bye, baby
Stone free, ow
