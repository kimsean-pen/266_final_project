Time to try again
At home I need to find my pills
Something they forgot to teach was
How to relax with things this steep
And you and I've been told
Right now we're getting older
To use some sense in how to look
Oh I never had enough
So I try again
Can't seem to find the time
To straighten out and make something right
It's all good to wish you well but
What's the point no kiss and tell
But it's ours
Since we've been told
Right now we're getting older
To use some sense in how to look
Oh you know I never had enough
So I try again
