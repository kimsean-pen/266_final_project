Remember when I took you up to the top of the hill?
We had our knives drawn, they were as sharp as we were in love
If God crossed us we'd take all his drugs
Burn his money and his house down
And wait for the fire to spread

Sometimes hate is not enough to turn this all to ashes
Together as one against all others
Break all of your wings and make sure it crashes

We're running to the edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
I don't know if the world will end today

Had no choice to erase the debt of our family
Let you say goodbye with lips like dynamite
Everyone turned their back, 'cause they knew when we held on tight to each other
We were something fatal, that fell into the wrong hands
Sometimes hate is not enough to turn this all to ashes

Together as one against all others
Break all of your wings and make sure that it crashes
We're running to the edge of the world

Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
I don't know if the world will end today
We don't seek death, we seek destruction

Death, we seek destruction
We don't seek death, we seek destruction

Death, we seek destruction
We're running to the edge of the world

Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
But I don't know if the world will end today
We're running to the edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
I don't know if the world will end today
See a new begining rise behind the sun

We can never catch up to it as fast as we run
See a new begining rise behind the sun
We can never catch up to it as fast as we run
(We don't seek death, we seek destruction)
See a new begining rise behind the sun
(Death, we seek destruction)
We can never catch up to it as fast as we run
(We don't seek death, we seek destruction)
See a new begining rise behind the sun
(Death, we seek destruction)
We can never catch up to it as fast as we run
