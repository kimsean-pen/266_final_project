Don't let your eyes ever go shut on me.
I won't let your voice be silenced, silenced

Blood is dripping from my hands
Tell me, Is this what you wanted?
I'm the one that walked away
For me, it's all that I needed
With nowhere to turn I'll find truth

Only with you
What's left of me is yours to keep
What's left of me is yours
Only with you
What's left of me is yours to keep
What's left of me is yours

One last chance for salvation, salvation
See this empty hole inside
Don't let It keep growing deeper
I'm the one who runs away
It's true I'm lost on the outside

With nowhere to turn I'll find truth

Only with you
What's left of me is yours to keep
What's left of me is yours
Only with you
What's left of me is yours to keep
What's left of me is yours
Breathe you in and it's all over now
When my arms open
Breathe you in and it's all over now
When my arms open
Breathe you in I'll breathe you in
Breathe you in I'll breathe you in
Breathe you in and its all over now
When my arms open, When my arms open
Breathe you in and its all over now
When my arms open, When my arms open

Oh, I'm drowning
Oh, I'm drowning
Oh, I'm drowning
Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me.
