Got a brand new obsession
Every time you turn your back
Always checking out the swing set
Baby, what you looking at?
The girl's got a secret, underneath those jeans
Camera's go up when she shakes that thing
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Little girl's in bikini's (yeah, yeah)
Learnin' how to surfboard (yeah, yeah)
Little Nicky wannabes (yeah, yeah)
Bringing sexy to the schoolyard (yeah, yeah)
Little boys like girls who let it all hang out
That wanna make them scream and shout
It's all about the woo hoo
And how you're worth the woo hoo
And a little more woo hoo
Make everybody love you
Well the country's getting bigger (yeah, yeah)
Less treble, more bass (yeah, yeah)
Every time I check my twitter (yeah, yeah)
Somebody's butt is in my face (yeah, yeah)
Sexy ain't a word only a few girls own
Lets hear it for the skinny girls, bring it on home!
Woo hoo
All about the woo hoo
And how you're worth the woo hoo
Make everybody love you
Love you
There's a doc down the block
Ain't afraid to give a shot
Get a brand new patootie
Super-size beauty
Wear it like a Prada like it's got it's own zipcode
Girl, where'd you get that?
Double bubble a la mode
Woo

Sexy ain't a word only a few girls own
Lets hear it for the skinny girls, bring it on home!
Woo hoo
All about the woo hoo
And how you're worth the woo hoo
Make everybody love you

How you're worth the woo hoo
