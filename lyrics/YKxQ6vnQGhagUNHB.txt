Do you hear that whistle wail?
I think the end is comin' in
I'm a whole lot worse for wear
But I'm determined to slip this skin

And I know you're dyin' for a good time
Dyin' to breathe again
Oh my, my Virginia

We could run all night and dance upon the architecture
Come and take my hand, I'll give the very best I can
But boy, I still want to be your man
I'm still these nervous feet and heart of stone
Forget this dead man's town, I'll take you home

Do you hear me late at night?
Always pickin' at the pieces
Sometimes nothin' comes out right
And nothin' is relievin'

But every soul man's song is a night I'd like to spend with you
Just twistin' the night away

But it's past quarter to three
And it's past the midnight hour
Mustang Sally's left the building
And we're so much worse without her

If I could put down this old hammer
I'd take you somewhere new
Oh my, my Virginia

We could run all night and dance upon the architecture
Come and take my hand, I'll give the very best I can
But boy, I still want to be your man
I'm still these nervous feet and heart of stone
Forget this dead man's town, I'll take you home
Oh my, my Virginia
We could run all night and dance upon the architecture
Come and take my hand, I'll give the very best I can
We could run all night and dance upon the architecture
Come and take my hand, I'll give the very best I can
But boy, I still want to be your man
I'm still these nervous feet and heart of stone
Forget this dead man's town, I'll take you home
I'll take you home
I'll take you home
