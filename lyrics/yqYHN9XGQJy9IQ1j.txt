that is
this definetly my face
without translation
what i hear let me tear
an aim
they are a feeling
there is end up to ten
what am i to say
what am i
what am i
what am i
to say
what am i
what am i
what am i
to say
what am i
what am i
what am i
to say
what am i
what am i
what am i
to say
what is it at you ears to hear my love
without even tearing
is it sour at your eyes to see my love
without we could allow to feel it
what am i
what am i
what am i
what am i
what am i
what am i
what am i
what am i
what am i
what am i
what am i
what am i
what is it at your ears to hear my love
without even tearing
is it sour at your eyes to see my love
without we could allow to feel it
no
hear me out
