I remember this moment
Years ago there was only you and me

I see her face in my dreams
Like a star shining all across the sea
I remember this moment
Years ago there was only you and me
When I wake up in sadness
I realized my deep wounds never heal
Living only in memories
All is lost, coldness I can feel

Sky turned darker and darker
Soulless voices whispering her name
End came closer and closer
Endless sleep was sweeping in her veins

She faded away
Like a rose on a winterday
I remember her last words
Please don't cry for me

Lost in endless night
Take me there, where I see you again
Reach out for the light
When will I break my pain
Come and fly with me
All across the raging sea
Together we will be
When will I ever be free

One night I was dreaming
Seemed to me like reality, so clear
A fallen angel inside me
Speaks to me, tells me what has to be done
There's a fire in my heart
Burning bright like the glory of a king
For too long I was waiting
Now my soul is flowing in the wind

She faded away
Like a rose on a winterday
I remember her last words
Please don't cry for me

Lost in endless night
Take me there, where I see you again
Reach out for the light
When will I break my pain
Come and fly with me
All across the raging sea
Together we will be
When will I ever be free

I remember this moment
Years ago there was only you and me

Lost in endless night
Take me there, where I see you again
Reach out for the light
When will I break my pain
Come and fly with me
All across the raging sea
Together we will be
When will I ever be free
