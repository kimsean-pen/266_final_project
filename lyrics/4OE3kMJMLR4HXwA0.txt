Wait a minute baby
Stay with me a while
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me about the fire

Drowning
In the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me call

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

And he was just like
A great dark wing
Within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match
He was singing
And undoing
And undoing
Ooh, the laces
Undoing the laces

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Said Sara
You're the poet in my heart
Never change
Never stop
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
But when you build your house
Well, then call me call

Hold on
The night is coming
And the starling flew for days
I'd stay at home at night
All the time
I'd go anywhere
Anywhere, anywhere
Ask me and I'm there
Yeah
Ask me and I'm there
I care

In the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
They say it doesn't matter anymore
If you build your house
Then please call me, call

Oh, Sara
You're the poet in my heart
Never change, and don't you ever stop
Now it's gone
No it doesn't matter anymore
When you build your house
I'll come by

(Ah, Sara, ah)
(Ah, Sara, ah)

All I ever wanted
Was to know that you were dreaming
There's a heartbeat
And it never really died
(Ah, Sara, ah)
Never really died
Won't you swallow your pride?
All I ever wanted
