Catch me, I've been drifting
I've been free in this space too long
Say to me what you want to say
The friction might shake my thoughts

Looking out the window
Everything seems fine
I've been losing days to pass the time
I'll admit I'm a mess with some unmade plans
And I know it'll be a while
Looking out the window
Everything seems fine

Are you losing yourself to somebody else?
Always inside your head
It's bad for your health
Taking hits when you should be protecting yourself
Are you losing yourself to somebody else?
Are you losing yourself to somebody else?

Looking out the window
Everything seems fine
I've been losing days to pass the time
I'll admit I'm a mess with some unmade plans
And I know it'll be a while
Looking out the window
Everything seems fine
