Maybe this is the end
Or a brave new beginning
At a crossroad of life
There's a choice to be made
By a restless heart

But the heart finds its way
In the shadows of doubt
If you carefully listen
It whispers to you
And you will know soon

Blood of a lion
Blood of the beast makes you who you are
Blood of a lion
Many will stand against you
But you will prevail and reclaim
Your crown and throne

With the cage now destroyed (now destroyed)
Let the sheep feel your presence
And you will storm the castle
With a thundering roar for victory
Your time has come

Blood of a lion
Blood of the beast makes you who you are
Blood of a lion
Many will stand against you
But you will prevail and reclaim
Your crown and throne

Blood of a lion
Scars earned in battles have made you strong
Blood of a lion
Let the world know the king
Has returned to rule his kingdom
Where he belongs
The king has returned

Blood of a lion
Blood of the beast makes you who you are
Blood of a lion
Many will stand against you
But you will prevail and reclaim
Your crown and throne

Blood of a lion
Scars earned in battles have made you strong
Blood of a lion
Let the world know the king
Has returned to rule his kingdom

Blood of a lion
Blood of the beast makes you who you are
Blood of a lion
Many will stand against you
But you will prevail and reclaim
Your crown and throne
