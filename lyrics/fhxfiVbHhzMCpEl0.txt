I met Mary on a moonless night
But her starry eyes could make the world look bright
She's young and perfect and full of life
And she said I'm gonna make it out one night
Gonna make it out one night
As time passed we both got old
From the bar she lived above she sat and wrote
By the light of blue and yellow neon signs she wrote
I'm gonna make it out one night
I'm gonna make it out one night

So go on work all your angles out
Get a plan together, get your demons out
Mary, the world wants to bring you down
But don't you let 'em

Oh, oh, oh...

I ran into her in Union Square
But her starry eyes were looking dim and scared
With the cigarette providing all the light
She said I'm gonna make it out one night
I'm gonna make it out one night
It rained the night I said goodbye
When I lit her Camel never thought to cry
'Cause Mary, you never were the stayin' kind
You were gonna make it out one night
You were gonna make it out one night

So go on work all your angles out
Get a plan together, get your demons out
Mary, the world wants to bring you down
But don't you let 'em

Oh, oh, oh...

There's a moment that we chase
And we fall along the way
'Cause we're not looking when we run
And if that moment never comes
Save your breath
We only get so many trips around the sun
And there's no lucky stars

So go on work all your angles out
Get a plan together, get your demons out
Mary, the world wants to bring you down
But don't you let 'em

Oh, oh, oh...
