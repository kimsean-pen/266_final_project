I've been wasting all my time
With the devil in the details
And I got no energy to fight
He's a fucking pantomime
The devil in the details

He's fixing up to take a bite
I don't see the point in trying
I got the devil in the details
And he's gonna teach me wrong from right
That fucking pantomime
The devil in the details
Well, I'm gonna dance with him tonight

All of my wrongs
No more wicked ways
Come back to haunt me, come what may
He wrote the songs
That I hoped to write someday
Looks like the devil's here to stay

Let me take you for a ride
With the devil in the details
We'll kiss and tremble with the light
Everything is fine
With the devil in the details
We're gonna dance with him tonight

All of my wrongs
No more wicked ways
Come back to haunt me, come what may
He wrote the songs
That I hoped to write someday
Looks like the devil's here to stay
Looks like the devil's here to stay
Looks like the devil's here to stay

All of my wrongs
No more wicked ways
Come back to haunt me, come what may
He wrote the songs
That I hoped to write someday
Looks like the devil's here to stay
Looks like the devil's here to stay
Looks like the devil's here to stay

I've been wasting all my time
With the devil in the details
I got no energy to fight
