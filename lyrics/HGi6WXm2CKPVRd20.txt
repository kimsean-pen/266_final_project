Wind yourself
Wind yourself tightly to me
Drag your old self
Nostalgia we're ready to leave

We'll ride this
We'll ride this
Easily
We'll ride this
We'll ride this
Surely
Pedal me closer
I promise to never
Look back down

It's taken time
Two ends are starting to tie
We'we traded off
It's friction that's given us heart

We'll ride this
We'll ride this
Easily
We'll ride this
We'll ride this
Surely
Pedal me closer
I promise to never
Look back down

We're not metaphor
We're not "the ticket"
No token to lull or remind yourself of yourself
Working pretend
It sounds out of place
Wind ourselves, Wind ourselves, tighter again

We'll ride this
We'll ride this
Easily
We'll ride this
We'll ride this
Surely
Pedal me closer
I promise to never
Look back down
