I'm not in love, so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

I'm not in love, no, it's because
I said I'd like to see you, but then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me

So if I call you, don't make a fuzz
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
Not in love, no, it's because

I keep your picture upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain still lying there
It hides a nasty stain still lying there

I keep your picture upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain still lying there
It hides a nasty stain still lying there

So don't you ask me to give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, hmm, it's because

Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh, you'll wait a long time
Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me
You'll wait a long time

I'm not in love, so don't forget
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

I'm not in love, I'm not in love
