So goodnight my dear
Hope you're feeling well
Hope your're feeling very clear
In this song and rhyme
Thoughts of changes that
Keep ourselves intact

And yes
It's hard to fake but I'm faltering
In the steps I'm about to take
I am sure it's true
What is all for me is much the same to you

If all the statues in the world
Would turn to flesh with teeth of pearl
Would they be kind enough to comfort me
The setting sun is set in stone
And it remains for me alone
To carve my own and set it free

So we wait and see
How this backward chapter reads
In verse inadvertently
And it feels like fading light
But that's all that's left

Only what's left is right

If all the statues in the world
Would turn to flesh with teeth of pearl
Would they be kind enough to comfort me
The setting sun is set in stone
And it remains for me alone
To carve my own and set it free

Jumping from a balloon
A carried aloft by a parachute in June
Twisting round and round
Well I hope the ground is what you find

The setting sun is set in stone
And it remains for me alone
To carve my own and set it free
