QAPITAL

This is a story spoken in the rhythm of the streets
A history carved out of hardship
Driven by the beats
Driven by the beat

We are who we are, never ashamed
Bringing the sound of a world domain
Rise from the streets
Survival is critical
Together as one
We are QAPITAL
QAPITAL

Driven by the beat
Rise from the streets
Driven by the beat
Together as one

Each city tells it's own story
It's a tale woven out of the tiny threads
That are the lives of it's people
This is a story spoken in the rhythm of the streets
A history carved out of hardship
Driven by the beat

QAPITAL
Driven by the beat

The city, is what it is
Because we are, who we are, yeah

We are who we are, never ashamed
Bringing the sound of a world domain
World...
Rise from the streets
Rise from the streets
We are QAPITAL

Rise from the streets

The city, is what it is
Because we are, who we are

We are who we are, never ashamed
Bringing the sound of a world domain
World...
QAPITAL

Driven by the beat
Together as one

The city, is what it is
Because we are, who we are
