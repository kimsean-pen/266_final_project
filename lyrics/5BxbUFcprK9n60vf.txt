Last call for alcohol
Last call for your freedom of speech
Drink up, happy hour is now enforced by law
Don't forget our house special
It's called a Trickie Dickie Screwdriver
It's got one part Jack Daniels
Two parts purple Kool-Aid and a jigger of formaldehyde
From the jar with Hitler's brain in it we got in the back storeroom

Happy trails to you
Happy trails to you

I am Emperor Ronald Regan
Born again with fascist cravings
Still, you make me president

Human rights will soon go 'way
I am now your Shah today
Now I command all of you
Now your gonna pray in school
And I'll make sure they're christian too

California Über Alles

Über Alles California
Über Alles California

Ku Klux Klan will control you
Still you think it's natural
Nigger knockin' for the master race
Still you wear the happy face

You closed your eyes, can't happen here
Alexander Haig is near
Vietnam won't come back, you say
Join the army or you will pay
Join the army or you will pay!

Yeah, that's it, just relax
Have another drink
Few more pretzels, little more MSG
Turn on those Dallas Cowboys on your T.V.
Lock your doors
Close your mind
It's time for the two-minute warning

Welcome to 1984
Are you ready for the Third World War?!?
You too will meet the secret police
They'll draft you and they'll jail your niece

You'll go quietly to boot camp
They'll shoot you dead, make you a man
Don't you worry, it's for a cause
Feeding global corporations' claws

Die on our brand new poison gas
El Salvador or Afghanistan
Making money for President Reagan
Making money for President Reagan
And all the friends of President Reagan
