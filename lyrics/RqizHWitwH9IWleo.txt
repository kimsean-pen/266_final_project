Well, well, well, well, well, well, well

Maybe you don't recognize
What you got between your thighs
Come on
(Well)

So I'm gonna set you right
And I'm starting here tonight
Well
(Well)

Shine like the moon
And strong like the sea
(Well)

More expensive than money
More valuable than anything
(Well)

Juicy mango, summer peach
(Well)
Make a lame man walk
And a full man hungry
Well, well, well, well
(Well)

And if you don't know what I'm saying
Then baby, I'm telling you

There's power in them rolling hills, come on
You're a prized possession, not everybody's worthy
Only reason I know 'cause I headed down that road
And it'd be a shame for you not to have your own glow
Come on
(Well)

W-w-well, well
W-w-well, well
(Well)

Maybe you don't recognize
What you got between your eyes
(Well)

So I'm gonna set you correct
So you can get what you should get, well
(Well)

Intuition's something sweet
(Well)
Let you know what you know
Let you find before you seek
(Well)

Spirit of discernment
Pray for it every day, well, yes
(Well)

Let you know who should go
And who you should let stay
(Well)

And if you don't know what I'm saying
Then baby, I'm telling you
(Well, well)

There's power in them rolling hills, come on
(Well, well)
You're a prized possession, not everybody's worthy to feel
(Well, well)

Only reason I know 'cause I headed down that road
(Well, well)
And it'd be a shame for you not to have your own glow
Own glow
(Well, well)

There's power in them rolling hills, come on
(Well, well)
You're a prized possession, not everybody's worthy
(Well, well)
Only reason I know 'cause I headed down that same road
(Well, well)

I wanna see you grow, I wanna see you glow
I wanna see you shine
I mean all the time

Gotta let that light
Gotta let it shine so bright
Maybe you don't recognize

There's power in them rolling hills, yeah
You're a prized possession, not everybody's worthy
Only reason I know is I headed down that road
And I wanna see you glow, I wanna see you glow

Glow, glow
I wanna see you glow
I wanna see you

There's power in them rolling hills
Power in them rolling hills
