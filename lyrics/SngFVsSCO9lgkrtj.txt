The sound of motors going out
Blows in
On weak tracks

Hidden traps
Where guilt is announced
A match to scratch
When truth is black

Pulsating
In a place of high rate suicide

Going out
Felt them out

Going out
Felt them out

Step of the wave
Step of the wave
Step of the wave
Step of the wave

Step of the wave
Step of the wave
