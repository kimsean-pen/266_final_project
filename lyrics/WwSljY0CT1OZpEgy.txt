Into the abyss i fall
And Dark is the reich of the dead
A portal to reach to the side
Where bodies fall from the sky
Solitude And Peace Of Mind
Entombed In Cromlech
Yes, flee over the River Styx
and join the dead with joy
An ocean of Blasphemy
Heathenish realm
and "Do What Thou Wilt" as decoy
My Prophecy is true...
We'll All Make It Through
