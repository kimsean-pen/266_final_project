Far too long I'm lost in the desert storm
Wandering aimlessly and so war torn
A deserted town appears in sight, for day by day and night by night
Her voice lures me back into the twilight

She says that I am like a leech (Vampire in ghost town)
She says I like when people bleed (Vampire, vampire in a ghost town)
Maybe this is the reason why all people leave
I, all alone, am the disease (Vampire, vampire in a ghost town)

I think her thoughts, steered by her silent voice
A fractious force that leaves me without choice
I'll take the blame without reserve, and night by night and day by day
I seem to be en route and still I go astray

She says that I am like a leech (Vampire in ghost town)
She says I like when people bleed (Vampire, vampire in a ghost town)
Maybe this is the reason why all people leave
I, all alone, am the disease (Vampire, vampire in a ghost town)

(Vampire) vampire in ghost town
(Vampire) vampire in a ghost town

She says that I am like a leech (Vampire in ghost town)
She says I like when people bleed (Vampire, vampire in a ghost town)
Maybe this is the reason why all people leave
I, all alone, am the disease (Vampire, vampire in a ghost town)

(Vampire) vampire in ghost town
(Vampire) vampire in ghost town
(Vampire) vampire in ghost town
(Vampire) vampire in ghost town
(Vampire)
(Vampire)
