It's possible that the worst
Of the inside
Could take our pencils away
End creating
Can't let the teachers lay waste
Of a new mind
Prevent emotional drought
And watch the pace quicken

Try to never touch
Try to never touch

Won't keep holding back my conscience
Realize
There's a choice to not end up like you
Not end up like you

Let's turn our wretched debates into action
By diplomacy gain, back a handshake
Tied and unable to tend, to the wounds that were made
So much closer to shame we see but never touch

Try to never touch
Try to never touch
Won't keep holding back my conscience
Realize
There's a choice to not end up like you
Not end up like you

Search
For
Truth
One more man
Tearing at the throat of
One more man
Never dropped as fast as
One more man
Coloring the fate of
One more man
Is better than the fate of you

Try to never touch
Try to never touch
Won't keep holding back my conscience
Realize
There's a choice to not end up like you

Holding back my conscience
Realize
There's a choice to not end up like you
Not end up like you
