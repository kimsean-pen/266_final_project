There's a devil in me
Trying to show his face
There's a God in me
Wants to put me in my place
I've got to get a hold of myself
I've got to be in possession

There's a war being waged
That'll never be won
It's the struggle for possession
I've got to get a hold of myself
I've got to be in possession
And I've got to ask you
What do you want from me?

You know the deeper you cut
The less there's left of me
I've got to get a hold of myself
I've got to get a hold of myself
I've got to be in possession
