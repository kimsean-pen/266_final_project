Pry the darkness from my eyes
Divided, let the light seep in
Trees devoid of branches, and hollow hives
Endless black and empty beds

It's not the same, something's changed
I never used to be able to see past the trees
A thousand unfamiliars are lying thick on the air and I can't breathe

Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home
Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
Don't tear apart the town then sleep, and sleep alone

If I'm a flame, I'm a forest fire
Speaking savage tongues as I emerge from the hills
I am an avalanche, I am unchained, I'm awoken, I'll unleash hell
So I roar, pin back my ears
And stone by stone I'll tear it all, I'll tear it apart

Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home
Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
(This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home)
Don't tear apart the town then sleep, and sleep alone
(This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home)

I've lost faith, the forest's changed
My stomach's empty I'm feeling faint
I've lost heart, the forest's scarred
I hear no birds, just TVs and cars

I've lost faith, the forest's changed
My stomach's empty I'm feeling faint
I've lost sight, the forest's died
The brambles are bare, and I'm hollow inside
Each breath rattles like dice in my chest
Each breath gambled, unwinding till death

Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home
(This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home)
Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home
Don't tear apart the town then sleep, and sleep alone
(This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home)
