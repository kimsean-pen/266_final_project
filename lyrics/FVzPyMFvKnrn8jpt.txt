He drinks, he smokes
He cusses,swears, and he tells bad jokes

Yeah, he ropes, and he rides
He lives life fast, and he loves to fight

He's a boozer, a loser
He calls me up when he's had too much
He's a schemer, a dreamer

When I tell him to change his ways
He just turns to me and says
I, ain't no quitter

I ain't giving up on him just yet
'Cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get

No he won't quit, but you can bet
I'm sticking to it
I, ain't, I ain't no quitter

He chews, and he spits
Well he flirts too much, and he loves blond chicks

He struts, and he strolls
And he looks so cool, and yeah, he knows
He's a beauty, a cutie

His body rocks and the girls they flock
He's afflicted, addicted

When I tell him to change his ways
He just turns to me and says
I, ain't no quitter

No, I ain't giving up on him just yet
'Cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get

He won't quit, but you can bet
I'm sticking to it
I, ain't, I ain't no quitter

Ah, his body rocks, and the girls they flock
He's afflicted, addicted

When I tell him to change his ways
He just turns to me and says
I, ain't no quitter

I ain't giving up on him just yet
'Cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get

No, I ain't giving up on him just yet
'Cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get

No he won't quit, but you can bet
I'm sticking to it
I, ain't, I ain't no quitter

No, believe me
I, ain't, no quitter
Uhm, yeah I, ain't,yeah I ain't no quitter
