My heart is an apartment building on the verge
A testament to days more optimistic
But market shifts can cause storm systems to converge
"Til all your high rise dreams seem unrealistic

I wanna keep the lights on
I could raise the rents and resurface the pool
I could take the banks on repay all my debts get my ass back to school

Love and great buildings will survive
Strong hearts and concrete stay alive
Through the great depressions
Yeah, the best things are designed to stand the test of time

Brick and plaster, beams and broken windows
Shadows pass on sidewalks cracking to the curb.

I wanna keep the lights on
Repair the foundation maybe hire a crew
Plant a little garden, start the renovation, get my ass back to you

Love and great buildings will survive
Strong hearts and concrete stay alive
Through the great depressions
Yeah, the best things are designed to stand the test of time

Hey hey hey... Oh
Hey hey hey... Oh oh
Hey hey hey... Oh
Hey hey hey... Oh
Hey Hey Hey

Love and great buildings will survive
(Buildings will survive)
Strong hearts and concrete stay alive
(Concrete stay alive)
Through the great depressions
Yeah, the best things are designed to stand the test of time

Love and great buildings will endure
Blue skies and bloodlines are the cure for the great deceptions
In a world that's such a blur we'll stand the test of time
