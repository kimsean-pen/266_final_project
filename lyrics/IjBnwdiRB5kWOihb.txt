Do not get me wrong
I cannot wait for you to come home
For now you're not here
And I'm not there
It's like we're on our own
To figure it out
Consider how
To find a place to stand
Instead of walking away
And instead of
Nowhere to land

This is gonna break me clean in two
This is gonna bring me close to you

She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed
She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed

It's all up in the air
And we stand still
To see what comes down
I don't know where it is
I don't know when
But I want you around
When it falls into place
With you and I
We go from if to when
Your side and mine
Are both behind
It's indication

This is going to bring me clarity
This'll take the heart right out of me

She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed
She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed

This is going to bring me to my knees
I just want to hold you close to me
She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed
She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed
She is everything I needed
She is everything
