The Speeds working I see it in everyone
Like a lost idea under light bulb sun
Your eyes are ready for take off
melt in your head
What a beautiful state we are in

The jealous in my mind are all dead
I Love you so much
never
forget
all of your secret
are coming undone
What a beautiful state we are in

Goodnight another bad morning
Goodnight another bad morning
Goodnight another bad morning
Goodnight another bad morning

Goodnight, another bad
Goodnight, another bad
Goodnight, another bad
Goodnight another bad morning
