I was sure I was right
I was king for a day every night
I was wrong I was wrong
And I knew where to go
Every step was a step up the road
I was on I was on
As I reach for the sky
It was clear I couldn't fly
'cause I'm not that animal
All the animals are running after me
It's all that I can do to stay on two feet
All the animals are running to the sea
And I give it away every night every day
Every word that I say I'm an animal
So I land on a stage
And I find that I'm slipping away
Let it roll, let it roll
And the heart plays a game
Trying to fool a reptilian brain
In control, in control
Where I fly, or I fight
Wanna look into your eyes
There's nothing but animal there
All the animals are running after me
It's all that I can do to stay on two feet
All the animals are running to the sea
And I give it away every night every day
Every word that I say I'm an animal
So let your walls come crashing down
Let your prayers fall to the ground
Let me see your smile
At the corner of the block(?)
Be your words for a while(?)
Be a song for a while(?)
All the animals are running after me
It's all that I can do to stay on two feet
All the animals are running to the sea
And I give it away every night every day
Every word that I say I'm an animal
I'm an animal
