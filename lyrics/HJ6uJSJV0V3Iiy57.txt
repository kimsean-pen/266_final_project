Can't find love
Can't find love
Can't find love
Can't find love

When there is nothing to believe in
Biting on the lonely bullet
'cause you
Can't find love
Counting all the heartless stars at night
One by one
Try to keep your heart from breakin'
'cause you
Can't find love
Tasting all the tears you cry at night
One by one
When there is nothing to believe in

You can't find love all alone
You can't find love all alone

Running through the sleepless nights 'cause you
Can't find love
Cry away the lonesome day
'cause you
Can't find love
Crowded into solitary with the
Lonesome ones
Love could set your heart on fire if it
Would return
With something you can believe in

You can't find love all alone
You can't find love all alone

Find love, find love
Well, come on
Find love, find love
Well, come on -- well, come on

You can't find love all alone
You can't find love all alone

Walk fine talk fine do it if it feels fine but don't say no
Walk fine talk fine do it if it feels fine but don't say no
Fat ass no class so bad she'll never pass but don't say no
Slow kind fast kind do it till it wrecks your mind but don't say no
Take some make some do it till you make her come but don't say no
Inside outside no one gets a free ride but don't say no
My time your time
