My neighbor's car got stole last night
Right out of his driveway
We heard the dog 'a barking,
We never paid them any mind
And Mary says she's gonna lock the door
From now on when we go away
I've been walking around this farm
Wondering if it's time

Chorus
Time to get a gun,
That's what I been thinkin'
I could afford one if I did
just a little less drinkin'
Time to put something between
Me and the sun
When the talking is over
It's time to get a gun

Last week a government man was there
When I walked out of my back door
He said "I'm sorry to bother you ma'am"
It don't matter anymore
'Cause even while we're talking
Right here where we stand
They're making plans for a four-lane highway
And a big ole overpass

Chorus
Time to get a gun,
That's what I been thinkin'
I could afford one if I did
just a little less drinkin'
Time to put something between
Me and the sun
When the talking is over
It's time to get a gun

Mary says she's worried
About herself and her kids
She's never known anybody had a gun
And her daddy never did
Well I think it should be up to me
'cause when it's all said and done
Somebody's gotta walk into the night
And I'm gonna be that one

Chorus
Time to get a gun,
That's what I been thinkin'
I could afford one if I did
just a little less drinkin'
Time to put something between
Me and the sun
When the talking is over
It's time to get a gun

When the party is over
It's time to get a gun
