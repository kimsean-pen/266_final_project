Tell me I'm fire, baby
Tell me to open up
Shield my eyes, baby
They've seen so much

Tell me you're mine, baby
Tell me before I irrupt
Burn up in the sky, baby
Become the dust

I can see no use in
Ignoring your burning heart
Just to cool mine
It's such a waste of your time
But to love you takes every waking thought
I have when daylight comes
To believe the night

Give me your fire
Give me reasons to learn
Give me every excuse to burn
Let your flames rise
Let your flames rise

Give me your fire, baby
Leave me 'til I am distilled
And clean as the water, baby
And pour it over my fears, my fears

I can see no use in
Ignoring your heaving chest
When you cry
It can't be good for your heart
If loving me means every tear you make
Will burn your skin
As it leaves your eye

Give me your fire
Give me reasons to learn
Give me every excuse to burn
Let your flames rise
Let your flames rise higher
Too far for you to touch
Too hard is never too much
Let your flames rise
Let your flames,
Give me your fire
Give me reasons to learn
Give me every excuse to burn
Let your flames rise
Let your flames rise higher
Too far for you to touch
Too hard is never too much
Let your flames rise
Let your flames rise higher

I can feel the darkness in me
The matter on the earth is just awaiting to be
Set fire to and set free
From my anatomy
But I can feel the warmth from your heart
To fight a fire with fire make the darkness depart
So come a little closer then meet my melody
I can feel the darkness in me
The matter on the earth is just awaiting to be
Set fire to and set free
From my anatomy
But I can feel the warmth from your heart
To fight a fire with fire make the darkness depart
So come a little closer then meet my melody

Give me your fire (I can feel the darkness in me)
Give me reasons to learn (The matter on the earth is just awaiting to be)
Give me every inch that used to burn (set fire to and set free)
Let your flames rise (from my anatomy)
Let your flames rise higher (but I can feel the warmth from your heart)
Too far for you to touch (To fight a fire with fire make the darkness depart)
Too hard is never too much (So come a little closer then meet my melody)
