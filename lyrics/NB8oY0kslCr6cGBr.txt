Jesus, cry for your children
No more torment for the good of creation
I am the cyst on heaven's gate
I was the end when there was no beginning

Ravage through the bodies
Searching for the reasons
Why you're raped and left for dead
Now get in line
Front and center

The end is now their cries will fade
The time has come for the prophecy
Condemned to live in this cold world
Look through the eye of the Holocaust

See society disintegrate
Free your mind from what was lost
Dominate this wretched plague
Realize and retaliate

Get a gun and let it guide you
As shells erupt
Chaos detonates
Bleed for me
