Sparrows in the light
Drifting ever farther over time
Baby, is it right
That I can only hold you there?

Embrace under the sky
Now the stars are etched into my mind
Baby, is it right
That I can only hold you there?

If I see you again
Never will forget
I can explain

If I see you again
Never will forget
I can explain

Every time the stars
Reappear I wonder where you are
Baby is it right
That I can only hold you there?

No, it's not the same
I close my eyes and hope to see it again
Baby is it right
That can only hold you there?

If I see you again
Never will forget
I can explain

If I see you again
Never will forget
I can explain

If I see you again
Never will forget
I can explain

If I see you again
Never will forget
I can explain
