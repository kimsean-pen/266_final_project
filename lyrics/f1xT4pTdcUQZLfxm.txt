I don't wanna write it down
I don't wanna say it out loud
'Cause if I do, then it's real
If it's real, then it hurts
And if it hurts, it could only get worse

Can't get you out of my head
I listen to white noise instead
Can't get you out of my head
If I loved you too much, would you ever wanna see me again?

Blacked out on Election Day
I'm tripping over my words on stage
I'm a creature of fear and the fear is a curse
And if I'm cursed it could only get worse

Can't get you out of my head
I listen to white noise instead
Can't get you out of my head
If I loved you too much, would you ever wanna see me again?

When you really know me
And I mean really know me
Will you wanna know me anymore?

Can't get you out of my head
I listen to white noise instead
Can't get you out of my head
If I loved you too much, would you ever wanna see me?
If I loved you too much, would you ever wanna see me?
If I loved you too much, would you ever wanna see me again?
