Part of me has died
And won't return
And part of me wants to hide
The part that's burned

Once
Once
I knew how to talk to you
Once
Once
But not anymore

Hear the sirens
Call me home
Hear the sirens
Call me home
Hear the sirens
Call me home
Hear the sirens
Call me home

Part of me has vowed
To watch it burn
And the heart of me has tried
But look what it's become

Once
Once
I knew where to look for you
Once
Once
But that was before
Once
Once
I would have laid down and died for you
Once
Once
But not anymore

Hear the sirens
Call me home
Hear the sirens
Call me home
Hear the sirens
Call me home
Hear the sirens
Call me home
Hear the sirens
Call me home
Hear the sirens
Call me home
