You just make me happy all the time
Happy all the time, happy all the time, time
Happy all the time
'Cause you just make me happy all the time
Happy all the time, happy all the time, time
Happy all the time
You just make me
(Make, make, make...)

Don't leave me all night alone
Don't leave me, I want to know
If I could make you want to stay
If I could make you want to say

You just make me happy all the time
Happy all the time, happy all the time, time
Happy all the time
'Cause you just make me happy all the time
Happy all the time, happy all the time, time
Happy all the time
'Cause you just make me

'Cause I need you to want me
And I want you to be happy all the time
Happy all the time, happy all the time, time
Happy all the time
(You just make)

I need you
I wish you could see
What you do
It's hurting me
If I could make you want to stay
If I could make you want to say

You just make me happy all the time
Happy all the time, happy all the time, time
Happy all the time
'Cause you just make me happy all the time
Happy all the time, happy all the time, time
Happy all the time
'Cause you just make me

'Cause I need you to want me
And I want you to be-
'Cause I need you to want me
And I want you to be-
'Cause I need you to want me
And I want you to be-
'Cause I need you to want me
And I want you to be happy all the time
Happy all the time, happy all the time, time
Happy all the time
'Cause you just make me happy all the time
Happy all the time, happy all the time, time
Happy all the time
'Cause you just make me happy all the time
Happy all the time, happy all the time, time
Happy all the time
'Cause you just make me happy all the time
Happy all the time, happy all the time, time
Happy all the time
('Cause you just make me...)
