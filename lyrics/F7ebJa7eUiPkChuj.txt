It's just a ball of dust underneath my feet
It rolls around the sun, it doesn't mean that much to me
Take a chance on the edge of life just like all the rest
I look inside and dig it out 'cuz theres no points for second best
There's a raging fire in my heart tonight
Growin' higher and higher in my soul!
There's a raging fire in the sky tonight
I wanna ride on the silver dove far until the night
Till I make you take me on your mighty wings
Make you take me on your mighty wings across the sky
Take me on your mighty wings
Take me on your mighty wings tonight
With just a little luck, a little cold blue steel
I cut the night like a razer blade
Till I feel the way I wanna feel
There's a raging fire in my heart tonight
Growin' higher and higher in my soul!
There's a raging fire in the sky tonight
I wanna ride on the silver dove far until the night
Till I make you take me on your mighty wings
Make you take me on your mighty wings across the sky
Take me on your mighty wings
Take me on your mighty wings tonight
Oh, I wanna make you take me on your mighty wings
Make you take me on your mighty wings across the sky
Take me on out on your mighty wings
Take me on your mighty wings tonight
On your mighty wings
Make you take me on your mighty wings across the sky
