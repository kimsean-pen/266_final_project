I hate writing shit, it is so stupid.
What's my problem today?
Maybe I'm depressed,
Maybe I'm helpless
To what comes out my hand.

Pain,
Pain!
Pain
Pain

I hate writing shit, it is so stupid.
Why do I feel this way?
Feelings in my heart,
I'm in way too far.
Can't it
Won't go away

Pain,
Pain!
Pain
Pain

Before-long,
My song
Is dying.
Before-long,
My song
Is dying.

I hate writing shit, ain't looking forward to it.
What's fucked-up today?
Writing all this time,
Feeling all that's mine
Comes right out my hand.

Pain,
Pain.
Pain
Pain

Before-long,
My song
Is dying.
Before-long,
My song
Is dying.

Tell me now I want to know,
Is that me inside you see?
Is this fair,
I gotta let this song inside me...
Free.

Just Set me free.
Just set me free.
Just set me free.
Just set me free.

It just set me free.
It just set me free.
It just set me free.
It just set me free.
It just set me free.
It just set me free.
It just set me free.
It just set me free.

Before-long,
My song
Is dying.
Before-long,
My song
Is dying.

That's
Why
I
die.
That's
Why
I
Try.
