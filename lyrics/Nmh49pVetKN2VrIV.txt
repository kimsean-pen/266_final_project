I know I supposed to forget you
but I don't know how
And I know I supposed to forgive you
somebody tell me how

'Cause I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
And you're not everyone

I buried you deep in my heart

It takes everything in me
To make you happy
You take what I have to give
'Till I feel empty
And I'll keep coming back to be with you
Like the morning sun

Cause I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
And you're not everyone

I buried you deep in my heart

Cause I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
And you're not everyone

Cause I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
And you're not everyone

Cause I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
And you're not everyone

Cause I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
And you're not everyone

Cause I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
And you're not everyone
