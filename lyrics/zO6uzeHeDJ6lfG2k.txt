Wild
Inner fights
I won't ignore
Them anymore.
My crime
Is human kind
I'd bare it all
to change my world.

It sleeps more than often
It sleeps more than often
Free my hidden laughter
Free the wild man.

Hold On Love
All the love is there
Love is there
All the love is there.

Tied
Blindfold eyes
My sins are raw
Now and before.
All night
My instincts fight
These deepest wrongs-
Devided worlds.

It sleeps more than often
It sleeps more than often
Free my hidden laughter
Free the wild man.

And hold...
Hold On Love
All the love is there
Love is there
All the love is there.

Hold
Hold On Love
All the love is there
Just find the reason
