Well, I saw the time closin' in
You said you're leavin' me
And cursed with your perfection
Well said it's right to believe

Well, months and days they slowly pass
I'm not waitin' for you
You turned me 'round in your direction
I'm lookin' for you, yeah

You spin me your way
In your direction
You pull me your way
In your direction

Well, city lights are shinin' on me
Well said it's time to go
Abusin' you all across the country
Said I feel hot coals, yeah

You spin me your way
In your direction
You pull me your way
In your direction

You spin me your way
In your direction
You pull me your way
In your direction

You spin me your way
In your direction
You pull me your way
In your direction
