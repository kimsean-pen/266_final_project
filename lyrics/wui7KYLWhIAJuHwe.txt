Cut and paste
Were you sitting down
On the beaded impotence of New Orleans
A hint of suspense when that telephone rings
This is forever

It paved a wave of distance
Between the syntax error
From Austin's yellow brick road
This is forever

From this Texas breath exhaled
No sign of relief
Cause this you know, this you know
This is forever

March 23rd hushed the wind, the music died
If you can't get the best of us now
It's cause this is forever

March 23rd hushed the wind, the music died
If you can't get the best of us now
It's cause this is forever

Makes no difference
Your alphabet is missing letters
Seventeen, embalmed and caskets
Lowered into the weather
A drizzle, brisk and profound

From this Texas breath exhaled
Their relief
This is forever

March 23rd hushed the wind, the music died
If you can't get the best of us now
It's cause this is forever

March 23rd hushed the wind, the music died
If you can't get the best of us now
It's cause this is forever

Strum this broken harp
We were struck by the chords
Set from their hearts
Yes this is forever
This is forever

Cut and paste
Were you sitting down
On the beaded impotence of new orleans
A hint of suspense when that telephone rings
This is forever
This is forever
This is forever

Makes no
Makes no
Makes no

Seventeen, embalmed and caskets
Lowered into the weather
A drizzle, brisk and profound
From this Texas breath exhaled

Strum this broken harp
We were struck by the chords
To your heart

This is forever
This is because
This is forever

This is forever
It is because
This is forever
But you can't get the best of us now
