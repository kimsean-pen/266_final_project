Tragedy, a poisonous lover
You infiltrate to destroy
Vanity, a cancer unforgiving
A charlatan with poise

Fool me once, enough is enough
Was I more than a step on your way up?
Hollowed out, I've no semblance of love
Now you're just somebody that I used to fuck.

Lest we learn, the tables turn,
so I'm betting out,
I'm betting out.
You can be the prey in your masquerade,
but I'm getting out,
I'm getting out
There's nothing left to repair

Ravenous, self-rightious, and lurid
But how much more till you break?
Scavenger, so fucking undeserving
You slither in just to take what you can take

Counterfeit, I'm calling your bluff
Was I more than just a step on your way up?
Now you'll burn and you're flesh out of luck
Now you're just somebody that I used to fuck

Lest we learn, the tables turn,
so I'm betting out,
I'm betting out.
You can be the prey in your masquerade,
but I'm getting out,
I'm getting out
Against insight I fed your source of revenue
But now, it means nothing to me
to mean anything to you

Open grave, I was too blind to see
That "love", spelled to you is
"F-A-M-E"

You fuck your way up the ladder
Going down on your way to the top
Do your arms ever tire?
Or do they heal while you climb with your mouth?

Delete everything
Sever the yearning,
you can keep the fucking ring
Delete everything
You can keep the fucking ring

Lest we learn, the tables turn,
so I'm betting out,
I'm betting out.
You can be the prey in your masquerade,
but I'm getting out
Against insight I fed your source of revenue
But now, it means nothing to me
to mean anything to you
Nothing left to repair
