We used to swim the same moonlight waters
Oceans away from the wakeful day

My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to
Cut me, I'll bleed forever

My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to
Cut me, I'll bleed forever

Scent of the sea before the waking of the world
Brings me to thee into the blue memory

My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to
Cut me, I'll bleed forever

My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to
Cut me, I'll bleed forever

Into the blue memory

A siren from the deep came to me, sang my name my longing
Still I write my songs about that dream of mine
Worth everything I may ever be

The Child will be born again, that siren carried him to me
First of them true loves, singing on the shoulders
Of an angel without care for love and loss

Bring me home or leave me be
My love in the dark heart of the night
I have lost the path before me
The one behind will lead me

Bring me home or leave me be
My love in the dark heart of the night
I have lost the path before me
The one behind will lead me

Take me, cure me, kill me, bring me home
Just another loop in the hangman's noose

Take me, cure me, kill me, bring me home
Every way, every day I keep on watching us sleep
Relive the old sin of Adam and Eve
Of you and me, forgive the adoring beast

Redeem me into childhood
Show me myself without the shell
Like the advent of May
I'll be there when you say:
"Time to never hold our love"

My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
So I will bleed forever

My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
So I will bleed forever

My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
So I will bleed forever

My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
So I will bleed forever
