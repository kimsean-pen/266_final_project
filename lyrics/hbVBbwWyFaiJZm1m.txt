Light flickers on
In my eyes when we collide
In the dark I feel you flying
In the shadows we are golden

I I'll love you till death do us part
I with the very last beat of my heart

Cause we are like sparks
We are, we are, we are alive
Can't wait no longer!
We are like sparks
We are, we are, we are alive
So love me harder

Stars hold the plan
I never know we had the night
Take my hand and show me how
Can you feel my skin, it's burning

I I'll love you till death do us part
I with the very last beat of my heart

Cause we are like sparks
We are, we are, we are alive
Can't wait no longer!
We are like sparks
We are, we are, we are alive
So love me harder

We are like sparks
We are like sparks
We are like sparks

Cause we are like sparks
We are, we are, we are alive
Can't wait no longer!

We are like sparks
We are, we are, we are alive
Can't wait no longer!
We are like sparks
We are, we are, we are alive
So love me harder

We are like sparks
We are like sparks
We are like sparks
