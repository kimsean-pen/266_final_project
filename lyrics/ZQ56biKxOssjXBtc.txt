Thoughts race through my mind my hand around my widow maker
My arms around her waist my finger wrapped around the trigger
Thoughts race through my mind my hand around my widow maker
I'm not supposed to have these thoughts yet I havem daily
Standing at the edge of a cliff thinkin how fucked up is this
On my way down will I hit? On my way down will I miss?
Both black eyes all black sky I spread both arms and I try to fly

Even when we finally fall god is watching over all
Even if we have to crawl god is watching over all

Thoughts race through my mind my hand around my widow maker
There's some days I just can't help but feel like peasant David
Thoughts race through my mind my hand around my widow maker
If you say my life is mine then why can't I just take it?
Sittin with the knife on my wrist thinkin how fucked up is this
I used to have a life worth a shit now I have a life I won't miss
Both black eyes all black sky I spread both arms and I try to fly

Even when we finally fall god is watching over all
Even if we have to crawl god is watching over all
Even from behind a wall god is watching over all
Even our unanswered call god is watching over all
Even when we finally fall god is watching over all
Even if we have to crawl god is watching over all
Even when the night falls god is watching over all
Money pussy alcohol god is watching over all
God is watching over all
God is watching over all
Money pussy alcohol god is watching over all

God is watching over all
God is watching over all
God is watching over all
God is watching over all
