Born upon the sun. Firefighting fire
Sick and tired. Voiceless choir

Vast is the void in us. From death to living dust
Vast is the void in us

Kneel before the altar. Be before the altar
Kneel before you falter. Heal before the Father

Form death to living dust. Dead is the void in us
Vast is the void in us
