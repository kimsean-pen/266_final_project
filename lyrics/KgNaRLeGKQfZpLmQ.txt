I was out of your league
And you were twenty-thousand underneath the sea
Waving affections
You were out of my league
At a distance that I didn't want to see
Down to the bottom

I wanted a junction and often there was one
You'd surfaced face first and we'd
Share thought bubbles and
I still believed in the phases that we breathed
But I know the distance isn't fair to cross

I was out of your league
And you were twenty-thousand underneath the sea
Waving affections
You were out of my leage
At a distance that I didn't want to see
I wanted you nearer

Your depths made a pressure that
Punctured my works and all your fluids couldn't tolerate the
Force of my thirst
I love the place where we shared our tiny grace
But just because its real don't mean its gonna work

I was out of your league
And you were twenty-thousand underneath the sea
Waving affections
You were out of my league
At a distance that I didn't want to see
I wanted you nearer

And true affection floats
True affection sinks
Like a stone
I never felt so close
I never felt so all alone

I was out of your league
And you were twenty-thousand underneath the sea
Waving affections
You were out of my league
At a distance that I didn't want to see
I wanted you nearer.
