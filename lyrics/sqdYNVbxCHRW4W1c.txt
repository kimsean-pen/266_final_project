Ooh brother
Ooh it's funny
How good you are

I'll knock you down
Brother, please
Go tell
Who you
Want to

Under the ricks
Down by the beach
No, I'm not
Where you
Want me

Ooh brother
I'll get you high

Ooh brother
I'll get you high

I'll knock you down
Brother, please
Go tell
Who you
Want to

I see the snake
Down by my feet
Walk on
Just you
Watch me

I'll knock you down
Brother, please
Go tell
Who you
Want to

Behind my back
And the love beneath
Whispered
Into
Nothing
