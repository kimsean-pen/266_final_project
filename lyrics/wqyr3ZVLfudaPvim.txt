So you're leaving
So you're on your own

Almost again
Almost again
Almost again I have

State your reason
So you're all alone

Almost again
Almost again
Almost again I have

So at the speed of sound, I will be found
At the speed of light, I will be seen

Almost alone
Almost alone
Almost alone I have

So at the speed of sound, you're found

So it's over
Now you're on your own

Almost again
Almost again
Almost again I have

So at the speed of sound, I will be found
At the speed of light, I will be seen

At the speed of sound
