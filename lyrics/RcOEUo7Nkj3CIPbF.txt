I know you didn't realize
That the city was gone
You tought there would be advertisements
To give you something to go on

And so we search the sky for any flashing signs
We've gone to far beyond, the border it's just you and I
And if this is the end it's, the best place I've ever been
It feels so good to just get lost sometimes

Only the horses can find us tonight
Only the horses can bring us back home

Our tracks they will follow, they'll hear us calling
And save us by morning light
Only the horses can bring us back home

Tonight...
Tonight...

We can't escape the basic facts
How cold it can get
There's nothing to protect ourselves
When the rain gets us wet

So I'll just tell you know, this is our final bow
If you don't know the way to hold me, let me show you how
And if this is the end it's, the best place I've ever been
It feels so good to just get lost sometimes

Only the horses can find us tonight
Only the horses can bring us back home

Our tracks they will follow, they'll hear us calling
And save us by morning light
Only the horses can bring us back home

Tonight...
Tonight...

Only the horses can find us tonight
Only the horses can bring us back home

Our tracks they will follow, they'll hear us calling
And save us by morning light
Only the horses can bring us back home

Tonight...
