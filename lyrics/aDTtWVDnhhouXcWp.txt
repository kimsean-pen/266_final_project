It might take too long to turn the lights back on
I guess I lay awake, I guess I'll lay here and pray
Could you pour me one more drink? A glass of gasoline
Help me burn my pain, light me up in the rain
My so-called life is so good

Why do we die?
Why do we die?
Slow down

You wonder how I've been, you ain't been checking in
Just hope my vital signs would send me home again
My baby's in the grass, Jesus on the dash
I drive myself insane just hoping I could stay
My so-called life is so good

Why do we die?
Why do we die?
Slow down

Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down

When deserts turn into floods, White orchids cover with mud
No magic carpet today, not today
Who takes the reigns when I'm gone disintegrate from my throne?
No magic carpet today, not today

Why do we die?
Why do we die?
Why do we die?
Why do we die?
