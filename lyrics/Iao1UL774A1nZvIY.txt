On Jubilee street there was a girl named Bee
She had a history, but she had no past
When they shut her down
the Russians moved in
And I am too scared
And I am to scared to even walk on past

She used to say
All those good people down on Jubilee Street
They ought to practice what they preach
Yeah they ought to practice just what they preach
Those good people on Jubilee Street

And here I come up the hill
I'm pushing my own wheel of love
I got love in my tummy and a tiny little pain
And a ten ton catastrophe on a 60 pound chain
And I'm pushing my wheel of love on Jubilee Streets
I look at them now

The problem was
She had a little black book
And my name was written on every page
Well a girl's gotta make ends meet
Even down on Jubilee Street

I was out of place and time
And over the hill
And out of my mind
On Jubilee Street
I ought to á¹—ractice what I preach
These days I go downtown in my tie and tails
I got a fetus on a leash

I am alone now
I am beyond recriminations
Curtains are shut
The furniture is gone
I'm transforming
I'm vibrating
I'm glowing
I'm flying
Look at me now
I'm flying
Look at me now
