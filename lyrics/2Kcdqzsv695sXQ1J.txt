Hey still staring little girl,
are you looking at or past me?
Worry.
Simple symptoms won't leave you this underweight or red in the eyes.
No more rules, the ones we make don't last the night.
So pick up the pieces.
Start again, start over tuesday morning.
Conscience clean.

The caption reads:"How does he do it?"
Ms. too bad he treats me like i'm dead.
Nothing works to make this easy.
No more lies.
The ones we live will work just fine.
So pick up the pieces.
Start again, start over tuesday morning.
Conscience clean, alone.
I hope you figure out what it is you want.
