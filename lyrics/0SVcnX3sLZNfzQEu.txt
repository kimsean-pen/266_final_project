So long to young love I've anchored my heart
Farewell to small joys I've burned down the bar
I'm changing my name so I don't do no harm
Some say it's vanity, some say its charm

No levels, still the same old devils

Frightened of fear, a servant of time
Kidnapped the queen, I have angered the hive
Snuffed out the stars with celestial winds
Ended a cycle that started again
I stopped going out, they kept coming in
Was I saving my soul or saving my skin?

No levels, still the same old devils

Can't hold it close, can't let it go
Prisons in basements in slick model homes

I'm just a day-tripper on sacred terrain
My transformation went from mangled to tame
I don't feel different but I don't feel the same
I'm afloat with an ear to the ground
I built a fortress with some books and a phrase
I felt some heat so I came out of the haze
I saw the end and I was truly afraid
I have begged but I'm still not allowed

It's a trap, lay the bait, catch the rat
It's a trap, lay the bait, catch the rat

Flew home and left the unknown in the lurch
Kept finding bodies, I called off the search
Went to a hymn from a funeral dirge
Church in the hospital, dog in the church

No levels, still the same old devils

Shepherd me back, this time I know
I don't know nothing, I'm not in control

Mindful but gutless
Mindful but gutless
Mindful but gutless
Mindful but gutless

There's no need to panic
No need to panic
