My friend hates needles but he's not chicken
Knows all the statistics and his chance is slim
Making up excuses just to buy tin foil
And erode all of the meat around his gangly core
I know a lot of men in hardcore bands
Collectively funding the Colombians
Straight-edge guys who turn to weed and beer
'Til they all got divorced and they all grew beards
Not me, I'm a pill man
Not me, I'm a pill man
Not me, it's a thrill man
Not me, I like my pills
Some say it's a simple and a sterile crutch
A number on the bottle and three lines of dust
Killing brain cells in increments
Just to reel it all in 'til it all makes sense
So ya' like to have a drink knowing you might drown
In the Friday's bar where the dead go down
Take opioids or your home spun meth
Or claim that tripping helps you write the best
Not me, I'm a pill man
Not me, I'm a pill man
Not me, it's a thrill man
Not me, I like
Not me, I like
Not me, I like my pills
Not me, I'm a pill man
Not me, I'm a pill man
Not me, I'm a fill man
Not me
