The kids are free, now all they need
Is a gift from their mum and dad
They heard the tones of Spanish phones
Stranded in the sand

You left on the lights is there somebody home?
You left on the lights is there somebody home?
Left on the lights is there somebody home?
Light and magic

You cut your hair and made a friend
Now they're falling into you
This is the closest that you will get to them
How do you do?

You left on the lights is there somebody home?
Switched off your voicemail and left it alone
Left on the lights is there somebody home?
Light and magic

Then lost some time in someone's line
Might just've caught the show
This is not real, but it will deal with
This thing between tonight and tomorrow

Left on the lights is there somebody home?
Left on the lights is there somebody home?
Left on the lights is there somebody home?
Light and magic

By the beach in a one storey building
You're lucky if the light's not out
But baby, now you look like a xerox of yourself

You left on the lights is there somebody home?
Left on the lights is there somebody home?
Left on the lights is there somebody home?
Light and magic

The kids are free, now all they need
Is a gift from their mum and dad
They heard the tones of Spanish phones
In the end of the sands

Light and magic
Light and magic
Light and magic
