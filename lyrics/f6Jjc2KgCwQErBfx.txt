Witness
The Sun that sets
I felt a sickness
Grasping from beneath

Do not be afraid
Just pour your sorrow into the sea
It's written in the waves

I can feel
The way life ends
An ocean of sunlit swells
Drags us through the cold

Dusk can set
The darkness sets in
An ocean of sunlit swells
Drags us through the cold

Sunrise sinks above us...

As sunlight begins to sink,
Home has become
A place just out of reach

Our home has become
As broken as us

Home has become
A dream we awoke from
