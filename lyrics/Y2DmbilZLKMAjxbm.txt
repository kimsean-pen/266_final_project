Oh wasteland, ooh ooh ooh
I killed my daughters
I lost, lost, lost my meanings ooh-o
Broken hearts can mend, dead ones can't
In this shadow oh
Fills crimson darkness
I really lost you
I killed my whole morning start

Doo do-do doo doo doo doo
Doo do-do doo doo doo doo

So no, no, no we're going to yeah
No, no, no we're going too
In the light of day, fine at you
For the light of day I see it through
But its not like that, its not okay
Now its not like that, its not okay
Shit gave away, I lost my way
I gave away, I lost my
And on the ground, and the head is cold
And I meet you tops, to what I hope
But oh there's nothing there
There's nothing there
The locks stay in, don't go in here
So I stay inside, I stay in here
Sit back, look back on the days I tried
Oh rest in peace, rest in peace
Leave out what is mind of the birds and the bees

Doo do-do doo doo doo doo
Doo do-do doo doo doo doo
