There something on your mind
I see it in the way you see that night
you tell, you tell, you tell me, you tell you tell
You dancing with a knife
Leave me like a allow to sacrifice you
tell, you tell, you tell me, you tell, you tell
Cause your body talk to me so language top of speak
So unconsciously oh oh
Cause when your body talk to me
