After laughter comes tears
(After laughter comes tears)
After your laughter there'll be tears

When you're in love, you're happy
Oh, and then, when your in a arm, you gaze
(After laughter comes tears)
This doesn't last always

(After laughter comes tears)
After your laughter there'll be tears

My friends all say, don't try to hold it
But I can't let that guy know how I feel
(After laughter comes tears)
I'll try to hold back my, my, my tears
But they keep say

(After laughter comes tears)
After your laughter oh, oh, oh

I'll try to hide, hide my sorrows
I wonder, can I hold them till tomorrow
(After laughter comes tears)
Maybe, I hold them for a year
But they keep say

(After laughter comes tears)
After your laughter
Now you will see those wet little tears
(After laughter comes tears)
After your laughter
A little biddy tear will look plum into your eye.

(After laughter comes tears)
After your laughter oh, oh, oh
(After laughter comes tears)
After your laughter
