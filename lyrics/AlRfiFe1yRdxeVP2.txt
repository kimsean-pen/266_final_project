One of these days I'm about to break
And leave this behind
Gonna be days that you lose a fight
But I won't lose my mind

You know what I'm saying
I know who I'm playing
I'll keep doing what I gotta do for me

Maybe I can stop and change this world
Maybe I can be that super-girl
Maybe I can do more than you think
I know I can because
I have a heart that beats and I can love

And the rivers deep and the mountains high
And the world is tough but so am I
And I'm standing up 'cause I can love
And the light is on and it's in my soul
And I'm here for you, that's how I roll
And I'm standing up 'cause I can love

One of these days when you're losing faith
And you're down on the ground
What a sweet taste when you win the race
And they can't keep you down

You know what I'm saying
You know who you're playing
I'll keep doing what I gotta do for me

Maybe I can stop and change this world
Maybe I can be that super-girl
Maybe I can do more than you think
I know I can because
I have a heart that beats and I can love

And the rivers deep and the mountains high
And the world is tough but so am I
And I'm standing up 'cause I can love
And the light is on and it's in my soul
And I'm here for you, that's how I roll
And I'm standing up 'cause I can love

Love so deep, love sublime
Love so strong every time
Who I am is what you see
And yes, it's love that sets me free

Maybe I can stop and change this world
Maybe I can be that super-girl
Maybe I can do more than you think
I know I can because
I have a heart that beats and I can love

And the rivers deep and the mountains high
And the world is tough but so am I
And I'm standing up 'cause I can love
And the light is on and it's in my soul
And I'm here for you, that's how I roll
And I'm standing up 'cause I can love
