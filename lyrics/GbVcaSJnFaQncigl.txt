Ernold same awoke from the same dream
In the same bed, at the same time

Looked in the same mirror
Made the same frown
And felt the same way as he did every day

Then ernold same caught the same train
At the same station
Sat in the same seat
With the same nasty stain
Next to same old what's his name
On his way to the same place
With the same name
To do the same thing again and again and again
Poor old ernold same

La la la laaa la laaa
Laaa laaa

Oh ernold same (oh ernold same)
His world stays the same (oh ernold same)
Today will always be tomorrow (same, same, same)

Poor old ernold same (oh ernold same)
He's getting that feeling once again (oh ernold same)
Nothing will change tomorrow (same, same, same)

La la la laaa la laaa
La la la laaa la laaa
La la la laaa la laaa
