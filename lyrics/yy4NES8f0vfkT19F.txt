I'm so still, you never see me smile
I'm so cold-blooded, people call me reptile
I'm so suffocated, wasting my time

I'm the worst at keeping in touch
I'm the latecomer who never shows up
I'm the dice and I'm running out of luck

It's so serious in here
It's so claustrophobic
Get me out of here

I'm the last person who should care
I'm so scared, honey it was just a nightmare
I don't hesitate, I drag them by the hair

I'm so cryptic, I read between the lines
I'm so desperate, I heard it through the grapevine
I'm so blind, I never see the signs

It's so serious in here
It's so claustrophobic
Get me out of here

You're the dirt that's rubbed off on my lips
You're the dreams I had the night before we kissed
You're the life I left stranded and struggling in the ditch

You're the torch, shone straight into my eyes
You're the silhouette that's blinded by the foglights
You're the last thing I think about night after night

It's so serious in here
It's so claustrophobic
Get me out of here
