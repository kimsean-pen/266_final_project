Several times... Several times...
Several times they told me: don't even bother
Several times... Several times...
I didn't bother

Thunder light zone
Turn the lights off
The common sense has made you get it wrong
And wait a sec, pal
I'm from Natal
We'll never quit until we've won it all

I didn't know what to achieve when I first started
Too many reasons made me stay
I didn't care about the never ending circles
I didn't bother

Thunder light zone
Turn the lights off
The common sense has made you get it wrong
And wait a sec, pal
I'm from Natal
When you're beginning we have done it all

I own it, I fell in love with the perfect storm
And now I'm tripping in a wave of luck
Don't bother, don't even try, this is undefined
Under your skin we'll crawl into your mind

(Say no more...)
I own it, I fell in love with the perfect storm
And now I'm tripping in a wave of luck
Don't bother, don't even try, this is undefined
Under your skin we'll crawl into your mind

Say say say...
No more more
Say say say...
No more

Say say say...
No more more
Say say say no more
