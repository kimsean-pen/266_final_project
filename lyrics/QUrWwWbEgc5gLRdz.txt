Sometimes I feel so small
Like a picture on your wall
Like I'm hanging on just to fall
No matter how I try

So, love, sing to me gentle
That I'm more than just accidental
More than just inconsequential
Burning out tonight

All I need is the air I breathe
The time we share
And the ground beneath my feet
All I need is the love that I believe in
Tell me, love, do you believe in me?

There's a place down by the ocean
Where I take my mixed emotions
When my soul's rocked by explosions
Of these tired times

Where love sings to me slowly
Even when I feel low and lonely
Even when the road feels like
The only friend of mine

All I need is the air I breathe
The time we share
And the ground beneath my feet
All I need is the love that I believe in
Tell me, love, do you believe in me?

One light, one goal, one feeling in my soul
One fight, one hope, one twisting rope
I'm ready to run where the ocean meets the sky

All I need is the air I breathe
The time we share
And the ground beneath my feet
All I need is the love that I believe in
Tell me, love, do you believe in me?

All I need is the air I breathe
The time we share
And the ground beneath my feet
All I need is the love that I believe in
Tell me, love, do you believe in me?
Tell me, love, 'cause you're all I need
