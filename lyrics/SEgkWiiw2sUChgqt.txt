Upon the water, some of the birds still echo silent
Low tide is gone forever
Forever

Cast all the demons in the sea
Into the abyss of the earth
To the sleep of the wild sun
I want you to bury me, bury me

Upon the water, some of the birds still echo silent
Low tide is gone forever
Forever
Forever

Below the starlight
Pyres are burning above the water
White ships are gone forever
Forever

Cast all the demons in the sea
Into the abyss of the earth
In the sleep of the wild sun
I want you to bury me, bury me

Upon the water, some of the birds still echo silent
Low tide is gone, forever
Forever
Forever

The April skies, singing songs of goodbye
Farewell tonight, leaving with the tide
And the fire burns at the edge of the world
And the nightingale (The nightingale) shines upon the water

Cast all the demons in the sea
Into the abyss of the earth
To the sleep of the wild sun
I want you to bury me, bury me

Upon the water
(Cast all the demons in the sea)
Some of the birds still echo silent
(Into the abyss of the earth)
Low tide is gone, forever (Forever)
Forever
(Forever)

Upon the water, some of the birds still echo silent
Low tide is gone, forever
Forever
Forever
