with you
i saw
and i knew
all of my thoughts

make me, make me dream
to hide my lies
make me, make me dream
inside

And I
I feel in the sky
looks overhead
with sacred rain

in the
I see you in the cloud
looking too cold (?)
with wind to blow (?)

make me, make me dream
to hide my lies
make me, make me dream
inside
