Love me, leave me
Take my possessions and go
Wine me, dine me
Wreck all the things that I know

I'm enchanted I've fallen under your spell
How can I resist when you cast them so well

Baby Lee I'm only trying to remind you
They had me in mind oh yeah when they designed you
And Baby Lee I'm always watching from a distance
Oh marry marry me oh baby now I am insisting

Wake me, shake me
Put my emotions on show
Make me suffer
Tell everyone that you know

I'm enchanted I've fallen under your spell
How can I resist when you cast them so well

Baby Lee I'm only trying to remind you
They had me in mind oh yeah when they designed you
And Baby Lee I'm always watching from a distance
Oh marry marry me oh baby now I am insisting
