You are fine, you are sweet
But I'm still a bit naive with my heart
When you're close, I don't breathe
I can't find the words to speak, I feel sparks

But I don't wanna be into you
If you are not looking for true love, oh oh
No, I don't wanna start seeing you
If I can't be your only one
So tell me

When it's not alright
When it's not okay
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? (Say alright)
Will you say okay? (Say okay)
Will you stick with me through whatever?
Or run away

Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay (say okay)

When you call, I don't know
If I should pick up the phone every time
I'm not like all my friends
Who keep calling up the boys, I'm so shy
See, I can only start seeing you
If you can make my heart feel safe (feel safe)

When it's not alright
When it's not okay
Will you try to make me feel better?
When you say alright? (Say alright)
When you say okay? (Say okay)
Will you stick with me through whatever?
Or run away

Say that it's gonna be alright, that it's gonna be okay
Don't run away
Don't run away

Let me know if it's gonna be you
Boy, you've got some things to prove
Let me know that you'll keep me safe
I don't want you to run away so

Let me know that you'll call on time
Let me know that you won't be shy
Will you wipe my tears away?
Will you hold me close and say?

When it's not alright
When it's not okay
Will you try to make me feel better
When you say alright? (Say alright)
When you say okay? (Say okay)
Will you stick with me through whatever?
Or run away

Say that it's gonna be alright, that it's gonna be okay
Say okay, yeah (don't run away, don't run away)
Say okay

Say that it's gonna be alright, that it's gonna be okay
Don't run away
Will you say okay?
