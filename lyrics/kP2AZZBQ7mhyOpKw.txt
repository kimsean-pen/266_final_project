Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, uuuh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Mama, uuuh (any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouette of a man
Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo
(Galileo) Galileo
Galileo, Figaro
(Magnifico)

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
(He's just a poor boy from a poor family)
(Spare him his life from this monstruosity)

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
(Bismillah! No, we will not let you go)
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
Never let you go
Let me go (oh, oh, oh)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mamma mia, mamma mia
Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Uh uh uh, uh yeah, uh yeah

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Any way the wind blows
