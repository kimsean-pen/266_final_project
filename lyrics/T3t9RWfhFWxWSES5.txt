Softly we tremble tonight
Picture perfect fading smiles are all that's left in sight
I said I'd never leave, you'll never change
I'm not satisfied with where I'm at in life

Am I supposed to be happy?
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price
Am I supposed to be happy?
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price
You said
You said that you would die for me

We made plans to grow old
Believe me there was truth in all those stories that I told
Lost in a simple game, cat & mouse
Are we the same people as before this came to light?

Am I supposed to be happy?
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price
Am I supposed to be happy?
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price
You said
You said that you would die for me

You must live for me too
For me too
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You said that you would die for me

Am I supposed to be happy?
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price
Am I supposed to be happy?
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price
You said
You said that you would die for me
