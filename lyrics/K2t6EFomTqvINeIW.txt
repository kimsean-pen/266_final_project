Damn. Could. You. think before you cross that line
So used to doing what you know ain't right
All your words stuck in my head just like a sad song
And it's playing like a haunting melody
Got to keep myself from listening to your lies
And losing all reality

So what'd i ever do to you to make you be so cruel
So what'd i ever do to you to make you be so cruel
Was it something i did
Was it something i said
It's a mystery that i can't solve
So what'd i ever do to you to make you be so cruel

I'm so tired
Of drinking in your bitterness
And it feels so good
To call you on your ignorance

All your words stuck in my head
Just like a sad song
And it's playing like a haunting melody
Got to stop myself from falling into your hate
Cause i don't wanna live that way

So what'd i ever do to you to make you be so cruel
So what'd i ever do to you to make you be so cruel
Was it something i did
Was it something i said
It's a mystery that i can't solve
So what'd i ever do to you to make you be so cruel

So if you gonna tell somebody
That they'll never be anybody
Then you must not have anybody to love
So if you gonna tell somebody
That they'll never be anybody
Then you must not have anybody to love

Damn. Could. You. think before you cross that line

So what'd i ever do to you to make you be so cruel
So what'd i ever do to you to make you be so cruel
Was it something i did
Was it something i said
It's a mystery that i can't solve
So what'd i ever do to you to make you be so cruel
