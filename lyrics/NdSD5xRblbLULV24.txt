We are finally broken
It's finally true
All my scars are open
You met somebody new

Our mission is completed
I guess it is time
My heart is wide open
I'm ready to leave tonight

Any minute any minute any minute any minute I go
All it takes is a shot and some love, imagination and you

We will never
Be the same
But we are mot coming home again
We don't know
Where to go

Let's get high
The Dream Machine takes all of us
Come on board and leave the rest behind
Let's get high high high
Let's get high high high

There is no resistance
I hang at the beach
No commitments
No need to remember me

Your wild heart
The age of your soul
Is what makes you beautiful
Is what makes you beautiful

You can still be
What you wanted to be
Don't believe what they say
Don't believe what they say

Let's get high
The Dream Machine takes all of us
Come on board and leave the rest behind
Let's get high high high
I can see the sky high high
