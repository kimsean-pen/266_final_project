No one can ever follow
No one can ever know
Wind up the spinning top and watch it go, watch it go
Never gonna be easy, was it?
You didn't think it'd be so much fun
Smile comes despite the danger get some get some

There's something happening here
There's something here that I just can't explain
I know I'm where I belong
Deep down inside I've known all along!

I won't let you go
(This is what you really want)
So don't leave go of me
(This is what you asked for)
I wanted something more
(This is what you really want)
I wanted this right here
(This is what you asked for)

We laugh until it hurts
It hurts 'till we wept
The dead upon our feet
But there's joy somehow in me!
You're not as strong as I am
You're not as strong as I am!
Oooh oh oh, this is what you really want

This is that 1, 2, 3, 4
Now come back to chaos
Now 1, 2, 3, 4 now now
