3-OH!-3-Oh!
3-OH!-3-OH!
3- We're howlin' at the painted skies (OH!-3)
Shooting down your favorite sattelite
'Cuz everytime we're feeling like we're falling
We're trading places with a dark side
Baby there's a fire in the heavens
Baby there's a fire in the heavens
Baby there's a fire in the heavens
Baby there's a fire in the heavens
Do I need to say it?
Spray it with a can of paint just to see it
Across a freight train
I don't fight I'm undefeated
That's my life gang
3oh! 3 ya best repeat it
I'm teethin, ripping to pieces, your student thesis
of all the reasons, that I've been squeezed and sittin' here breathing
Summon the beast and 666, and minus the threes
And that be the reach, and where we be freezing, but we're releasing
All of the demons, when I'm inspired to spit fire up higher like it's open season
Baby there's a fire in the heavens
Baby there's a fire in the heavens
(Do I need to say it? 3oh! 3)
Baby there's a fire in the heavens
Baby there's a fire in the heavens
