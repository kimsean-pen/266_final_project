I want to be in love with you
I want to be in love with you
I want to be, I can too
I want to be in love with you

Stop bringing me down, I know
It's enough to get you back
My flawed way to
I never wanted to find

So addictive
It could all be ours to say
You and me, tonight

And I don't want to miss you at all
I-I-I-I-I want to miss you at all
I-I-I-I-I want to miss you at all
I-I-I-I-I want to miss you at all

So what have I done?
This is not what I wanted
What have I done this time?
Oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I want to be in love with you
I want to be in love with you

Stop bringing me down, I know
Is it what you had in mind?
My flawed way to
I never wanted to find

So addictive
It could all be ours to say
You and me, tonight

And I don't want to miss you at all
I-I-I-I-I want to miss you at all
I-I-I-I-I want to miss you at all
I-I-I-I-I want to miss you at all

I want to be in love
I want to be with you
