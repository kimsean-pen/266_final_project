You think I'm crying over you
You think I'm dying too
You think I'm thinking way to much
And sadly out of touch
With all the world and all my friends,
well think what you want and think again, think again

'Cause what you don't know is I'm throwin' a party
And everybody tonight is feelin' alright, with some jack in their coke
The records are spinnin' and the speakers are smokin'
There ain't no last call,
I'm havin' a ball with Hank Haggard and Jones
No, I ain't alone
I feel right at home with my ghosts on the stereo

There ain't no lights on, the curtains drawn
Just one car in the drive
And the neighbors might think it's a haunted house, yeah
But I've never felt so alive

'Cause what they don't know is I'm throwin' a party
And everybody tonight is feelin' alright, with some jack in their coke
The records are spinnin' and the speakers are smokin'
There ain't no last call,
I'm havin' a ball with Hank Haggard and Jones
No, I ain't alone
I feel right at home with my ghosts on the stereo
With my ghosts on the stereo

One song at a time, I get their advice
And the pain melts away like whiskey on ice

Baby, you don't know that I'm throwin' a party
And everybody tonight is feelin' alright, with some jack in their coke
Yeah, the records are spinnin' and the speakers are smokin'
There ain't no last call,
I'm havin' a ball with Hank Haggard and Jones
No, I ain't alone
I feel right at home with my ghosts on the stereo
Oh yeah, with my ghosts on the stereo
Yeah
Oh, yeah, I've got my ghosts on the stereo
