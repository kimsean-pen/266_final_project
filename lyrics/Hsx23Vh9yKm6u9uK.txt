Twenty years ago
Saw a friend was walking by
And I stopped him on the street to ask him
How it went and all he did was cry

And I looked him in the face
But I couldn't see past his eyes
I asked him what the problem was
He says, here's your disguise

Now he's hardly getting over it
He's hardly getting used to getting by
Now he's hardly getting over it
He's hardly getting used to getting by, by

Old man lays
Down by the railroad tracks
Got no paper on his pocket
Got no paper on his back

And I asked him what the time was
He says, hit the road now, Jack
Went back to see him next week
He died of a heart attack and died away

Now he's hardly getting over it
He's hardly getting used to getting by
He's hardly getting over it
He's hardly getting used to getting by, by

Grandma, she was sick
And she is gonna die
And grandpa had a seizure
Moved into a hotel cell and died away

My parents
They just wonder
When they both are gonna die
And what'll I do when they die?

Well, I'm hardly getting over it
Hardly getting used to getting by
Hardly getting over it
Hardly getting used to getting by, by

Well, I'm hardly getting over it
Hardly getting by
Hardly getting over it
Hardly getting by

Hardly getting over it
Hardly getting by
Can hardly get it over it
Can hardly get by, by, goodbye

Hardly getting over it
