Somewhere,
Beyond the sea,
He's there watching for me.
If I could fly like birds on high,
Then straight to him arms, I'd go sai-i-i-i-i-i-ling...

Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailin'

Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on a high
Then straight to her arms
I'd go sailing

It is far beyond the stars
It is near beyond the moon
But I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

And I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon
We'll meet (I know we'll meet) beyond the shore
We're gonna kiss just as before
And happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

No more sailing
So long sailing
Bye bye sailing...
