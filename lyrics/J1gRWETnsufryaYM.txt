Wooden floors, wooden floors whisper
And they creak under your sockless feet
A secret door, a door undiscovered
You knock so gently in case you're heard
A record plays a song that you've not heard
It is perfect, it is home
Everything, now everything's different
It is sweeter on your tongue

Cause you can see the road ahead in your dream
And the engine's more a sigh than a scream
And your ghosts look more like angels from there
And the coast comes like a raft of warm air

Cause you can see the road ahead in your dream
And the engine's more a sigh than a scream
And your ghosts look more like angels from there
And the coast comes like a raft of warm air

A symphony, slow music of longing
Plays in movements inside your head
There are no ghosts, no ghosts that can shake you
Like they used to, anymore

Cause you can see the road ahead in your dream
And the engine's more a sigh than a scream
And your ghosts look more like angels from there
And the coast comes like a raft of warm air

You can see the road ahead in your dream
And the engine's more a sigh than a scream
And your ghosts look more like angels from there
And the coast comes like a raft of warm air

If this is all you ever asked for
Then this is all you'll get
If this is all you ever asked for
Then this is all you'll get
If this is all you ever asked for
Then this is all you'll get
If this is all you ever asked for
Then this is all you'll get
If this is all you ever asked for
Then this is all you'll get
If this is all you ever asked for
Then this is all you'll get
If this is all you ever asked for
Then this is all you'll get
If this is all you ever asked for
Then this is all you'll get
