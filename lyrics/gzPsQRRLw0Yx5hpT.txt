She was always here in my heart
She was always here in my heart
She was always here in my heart

Always the love of my life
Always the love of my life
Always the love of my life

We were strangers, oceans apart
We were strangers, oceans apart

But when I laid eyes on her a part of me died
But when I laid eyes on her a part of me died
But when I laid eyes on her a part of me died
