Tonight I'm gonna break away
Just you wait and see
I'll never be imprisoned by
A faded memory

Just when I think I'm over her
This broken heart will mend
I hear her name and I have to cry
The tears come down again

It happens all the time
This crazy love of mine
Wraps around my heart
Refusin' to unwind
Ooh-hoo, crazy love
Ah ha

Count the stars in a summer sky
That fall without a sound
And then pretend that you can't hear
These teardrops comin' down

It happens all the time
This crazy love of mine
Wraps around my heart
Refusin' to unwind
Ooh-hoo, crazy love
Ah ha

Tonight I'm gonna break away
Just you wait and see
I'll never be imprisoned by
A faded memory

It happens all the time
This crazy love of mine
Wraps around my heart
Refusin' to unwind
Ooh-hoo, crazy love
Ah ha

Tonight I'm gonna break away
