Mhmm
Mhmm
Mhmm

I had a dream so big and loud
I jump so high I touch the clouds
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
I stretch my hands out to the sky
We dance with monsters through the night
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh

I'm never gonna look back woah
I'm never gonna give it up, no
Please don't wake me now, hey

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life

I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
But all the possibilities
No limits just epiphanies

I hear it calling
Outside my window
I feel it in my soul (woah)

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life

This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be
Yeah yeah
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be
Oh oh

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be
Yeah yeah
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be
(The best day)
This is gonna be the best day
Of my life
