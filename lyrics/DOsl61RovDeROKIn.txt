Shuggie hides
Just to jump infront of her friends
Anytime
She'll wrestle them any place

Oh, Shuggie
Shuggie can't wait
Oh, Shuggie
Shuggie can't stay

When you're not with me
I know
That something's missing
Oh, oh, Shuggie

Shuggie says
You better wipe that look off your face
Any time
She'll take you down any place

Oh, Shuggie
Shuggie can't wait
Oh, Shuggie
Shuggie can't stay

When you're not with me
I know
That nothing's missing
Oh, oh, Shuggie
