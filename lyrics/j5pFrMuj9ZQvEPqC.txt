Let me tell you now all that's on my mind
For a love like yours is oh so very hard to find
Looked inside myself now I'm very sure
There can only be you for me
I need you more and more...

You turned me inside out
And you showed me what life was about
Only you
The only one that stole my heart away
I wanna do all I can just to show you
Make you understand
Only you
The only one that stole my heart away

When you're in my arms
When I'm close to you
There's a magic in your touch that just comes shining through
Want you everyday
Want you every night
There can only be you for me
You make it seem so right
Oh, girl
Cause you turned me inside out

And you showed me what life was about
Only you
The only one that stole my heart away
Oh, a-a-a-h
Mmmm
In my mind there's no other love
You're the only girl my heart and soul is thinking of

Only you only me (only me)
There can never ever be another
That understands the way that I feel inside
Cause you turned me inside out

And you showed me what life was about
Only you
The only one that stole my heart away
Yeah you turned me inside out
And you showed me what life was about
Only you
The only one that stole... my heart away
(you stole my heart away)
You stole it
(you stole my heart away)
Only you
The only one that stole my heart away
Yeah you
(you stole my heart away)
Oh, you stole it
(you stole my heart away)
Only you
The only one that stole... my heart away
(you stole my heart away)
(you stole my heart away)
