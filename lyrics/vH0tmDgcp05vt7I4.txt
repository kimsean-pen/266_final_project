What I wouldn't give for - a chance to feel
What I wouldn't give for - a chance to heal
What I wouldn't give for - a chance to cry
What I wouldn't give for - a chance to die

All the beauty I feel - I know it's not real
All the beauty I see - will never belong to me

I tried not to hide
But I fell apart
Why do I try
To desolate my heart

What I wouldn't give for - a chance to hate
What I wouldn't give for - it's all to late
What I wouldn't give for - a chance to need
What I wouldn't give for - a chance to bleed

All the beauty I feel - I know it's not real
All the beauty I see - will never belong to me

I tried not to hide
But I fell apart
Why do I try
To desolate my heart

All the beauty I see - will never belong to me
All the beauty I feel - I know it's not real
I know that it's not real...

What I wouldn't give for - a chance to feel
What I wouldn't give for - a chance to heal
What I wouldn't give for - a chance to cry
What I wouldn't give for - a chance to die

All the beauty I feel - I know it's not real
All the beauty I see - will never belong to me
All the beauty I feel - I know it's not real
All the beauty I see - will never belong to me

I tried not to hide
But I fell apart
Why do I try
To desolate my heart
I tried not to hide
But I fell apart
Why do I try
To desolate my heart...
