I'm with the enemy in my bed
(When the voice in my head)
Tells me I should treat myself better
I know you don't mean to be mean
When you're hurting you'll see
You can see just how dark it is getting...

So one hand is holding your body
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
But one hand is holding your body
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
It's your turn to cry

Why are you so sad?
But I think it's time now
You're too crying feel so bad
But can I lie down

I'm with the enemy in my bed
When the voice in my head
Tells me I should treat myself better
I know you don't mean to be mean
When you're hurting you'll see
You can see just how dark it is getting

So one hand is holding your body
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
But one hand is holding your body
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
It's your turn to cry

Feel my heart break!
Feel my heart break!
Feel my heart break!
As I walk away (As I walk away)

Feel my heart break!
Feel my heart break!
Feel my heart break!
As I walk away (As I walk away)

So one hand is holding your body
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
But one hand is holding your body
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
It's your turn to cry
(It's your turn to cry...)
