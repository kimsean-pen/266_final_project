Did it again, did it again
Did it again, did it again

What am I supposed to do
To keep from going under?
Now you're making holes in my heart
Guess it's starting to show

I've been holding back
Is it any wonder?
Since you walked right into my life
And interrupted the flow

And I wanna know, baby, when you're with me
Who do you think you're fooling?
Making me feel so sure
Turning your lovelight down again

Why don't you let me be?
You don't know what you're doing
Making me feel so sure
Turning your lovelight down again

Did it again, did it again

Baby, I've got to know
Are we gonna make it?
Layin' down beside me tonight
Do whatever you feel

Baby, you're in control
Where you gonna take it?
Don't you think that I'll do you right?
You know darn well that I will

And I wanna know, baby, when you're with me
Who do you think you're fooling?
Making me feel so sure
Turning your lovelight down again

Why don't you let me be?
You don't know what you're doing
Making me feel so sure
Turning your lovelight down again

Did it again, did it again
Did it again, did it again

Baby, you turn the lovelight down
And I don't know just how long, I can stick around
Girl I need more and it ain't just physical
But I don't know what I can do
'Cause I found it ain't love this time around

Baby, when you're with me
Who do you think you're fooling?
Making me feel so sure
Turning your lovelight down again

Why don't you let me be?
You don't know what you're doing
Making me feel so sure
Turning your lovelight down again
