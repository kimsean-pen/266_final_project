Take my hand and walk in the light
Understand it, a fire to ignite
You know we have a responsibility
It's true we've been chosen
And now we have the possibility
Of melting what's frozen

Walk with me with the rapture inside
Can't you see it's not a place to decide?
You know we have to make a case for love
It's more of a duty
It's clear we have a mission from above
A mission of beauty
You know I wouldn't lie to you
What would I achieve by that?
It's more than I would try to do
These are the facts

Take your place here with love in your heart
Just embrace what you've known from the start
We offer a feeling
An only destiny
The angel's spoken
And all the gods in the universe agree
The spell can be broken
