Her black shadow at the foot of your bed
Her pure white dress you can feel her on your breast
You can't stop her in the coils of her sweet spell
You can feel her she's so close to your heart

Every night after tolling of last bell
Silent coming languid, graceful into a trance

You can't stop her, no, you can't talk, can't escape
No more whispers. no more sorrow no more pain

Carmilla, comes to me
Mircalla, I want you
Carmilla, she comes to you
Mircalla, I want your screams

Now I see you at the foot of my bed
Your pure white dress is a one great scarlet stain
I can't stop you in the coils of your sweet spell
I can feel you, you're so close to my heart

She comes to bring the sorrow
She is like a cold embrace
She murmurs words of madness
She comes to bring the death

"You are mine, you shall be mine "
she says..."love will have its sacrifices."
"there's a coldness beyond her years,
in her smiling endless melancholy,
the refusal to afford you the least ray of light"
You see her under the moon shadow,
Standing near the feet of your bed,
In her lacy white dress
Bathed, from her chin to her feet,
In one great scarlet stain.
She says again...
"there's no sacrifice without blood"
