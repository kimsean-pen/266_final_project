Oh boy
Hiding tears behind his smile
So young and cold
Trying hard to reach her
Love is the cure, love is the light
Another day, another night

I don't see him anymore
I don't see her anymore
I don't see him anymore
I don't see them anymore

Oh girl
Hiding tears behind her smile
So young and cold
Trying hard to reach him
Love is so strong, love fades away
Another night another day

I don't see her anymore
I don't see him anymore
I don't see her anymore
I don't see them anymore
