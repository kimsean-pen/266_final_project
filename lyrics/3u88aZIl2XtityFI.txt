In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again
For now I find
The phantom of the opera is here
Inside my mind
Sing once again with me

Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside your mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear

I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear
Your/My spirit and My/Your voice in one combined
The phantom of the opera is Here/There

Inside My/Your mind
He's there

The phantom of the opera
Beware

The phantom of the opera
In all your fantasy

You always knew
That man and mystery

Were both in you
And in this labyrinth

Were night is blind
The phantom of the opera is Here/There
Inside My/Your mind
Sing! My angel of music
He's there
The phantom of the opera
Sing My Angel of Music
Sing My Angel
Sing
Sing to me!
