Shoot the gun
Shoot the gun to the bang, bang, bang
Shoot the gun
Shoot the gun to the bang, bang, bang

Shoot the gun, it's all inside us
And also know that I slice us
Too many tied to the
Too many tied to the bang, bang, bang

Shoot the gun, shoot the gun
Shoot the gun to the bang, bang, bang
Shoot the gun, shoot the gun
Shoot the gun to the bang, bang, bang
Woarh!

To the bang, bang, bang
There's no fun, a sorry face

Shoot the gun, shoot the gun
Shoot the gun to the bang, bang, bang
Shoot the gun, shoot the gun
Shoot the gun to the bang, bang, bang

Too many tied to the
Too many tied to the bang, bang, bang
Too many tied to the
Too many tied to the bang, bang, bang

Bang, bang, bang
There's no fun, sorry face
There's no fun, sorry fate
Woarh!

Fate, your time is running, your time is running out
Your time is running out, running out, running out
Running out, running out, running out, running out
Running out
