Well-dressed, but walking
in the wrong direction.
Louisiana
my disordered road always
led straight back into you.
Ha ha ha! Goes the train.
I wanted to leave
but here I am again.
Louisiana!
I don't remember I don't remember
ever shaking hands with You-Know-Who
When I was alive I lived despite the law
Now the law has buried me many many times.
It's built a freeway all around my bed.
I saw it once open its great mouth wide.
But it was so full of afflicted houses and buildings,
I can't remember what it was saying.
Well-dressed, well
Some of us are,
that is the ones who know how that is.
Some of us are,
that is the ones who know how that is (that is that is).
I read about you and came home to find my mother
staring deep into the dark dark web.
She's begging me not to give my
Social Security number to anybody else
There goes the sound of the freeway
Ha ha ha ha ha goes the train
Well-dressed but
walking in, walking in
I don't wanna go back
