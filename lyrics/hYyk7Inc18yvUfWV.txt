I'm so bored
With this world that spins around me
Used to make me dizzy
I'm so tired
Of these boys that hang around me
Used to drive me crazy

A little mayhem never hurt anyone
Where'm I gonna get some?
A little bedlam 'til I'm coming undone
Where'm I gonna get some?

A little mayhem never hurt anyone
I'ma gonna get some, get some, get some
A little bedlam 'til I'm coming undone
I'ma gonna get some, get some, get some

Cruel intentions
Wind me in a spiral
I'm waiting to unravel
Twisted motives
Drive me in a circle
I'm dying to untangle

A little mayhem never hurt anyone
Where'm I gonna get some?
A little bedlam 'til I'm coming undone
Where'm I gonna get some?

A little mayhem never hurt anyone
I'ma gonna get some, get some, get some
A little bedlam 'til I'm coming undone
I'ma gonna get some, get some, get some

I wanna feel the chaos
I wanna hear the uproar
A little pandemonium
I know I'm not the only one
I wanna be blown away
I wanna feel the walls shake
I wanna feel the walls shake
I wanna feel the walls shake
Shake it shake it shake it shake it...

One, Two, Three, Four
Looking for some mayhem
Need A little mayhem
Need A little mayhem
Looking for some mayhem
Looking for some mayhem
Need a little mayhem
Wanna get some mayhem
