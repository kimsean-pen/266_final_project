I wouldn't hide this feeling
A coward's crown - please raise it high
I couldn't stop the warning
Split like a lip on top of mine
I wouldn't leave you in the sunlight
I wouldn't keep you in the sun's eye
Keep us lying
If there's a meaning I will say it all again

You wouldn't call my name
It's always been the same
It's true your eyes don't look at me
I couldn't tell you if I knew it or not

It could be islands
It could be better!

Who can have this feeling?
A coward's crown - please raise it high
I could hold off in the morning
Growing bolder in the night
I wouldn't leave you in the sunlight
I wouldn't keep you in the sun's eye

You wouldn't call my name
It's always been the same
It's true your eyes don't look at me
I couldn't tell you if I knew it or not

It could be islands
It could be better!
