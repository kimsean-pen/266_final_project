Lately I'm not feeling like myself
When I look into the glass, I see someone else
I hardly recognize this face I wear
When I stare into her eyes, I see no one there
Lately I'm not feeling like myself
Lately I've been losing all my time

All that mattered to me slipped my mind
Everytime I hit another town, strangers appear to lock me down
Lately I've been losing all my time
The mystery that no one knows

Where does love go when it goes?
Lately words are missing from now on
Vanished in the haze of love gone wrong
There's no future, there's no past
In the present, nothing lasts
Lately someone's missing from now on
The mystery that no one knows

Where does love go when it goes?
The mystery that no one knows
Where does love go when it goes?
