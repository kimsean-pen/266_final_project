Said you'd never make me feel like that again
Guess that your obsession's, never gonna end
Why on Earth you mess me up?
I'll never know
I will not be your stepping stone

I'm better than all of that
Being ignored by you
Lately, that's all I have
Gonna need more from you, need more from you
I will not be your stepping stone

I don't cry no tears for free
How you gonna make it up to me?
I don't cry no tears for free
How you gonna make it up to me?
Gotta make it up, make it up to me
Gotta make it up, make it up to me

You said that you would try your best to make it right
Tell me why I always have to make you fight?
If I'm the one that you really crave
You gotta step up and up your game

I'm better than all of that
Why do I try with you?
Lately, that's all I have
Yeah, I need more from you, need more from you
I will not be your stepping stone

I don't cry no tears for free
How you gonna make it up to me?
I don't cry no tears for free
How you gonna make it up to me?
Gotta make it up, make it up to me
Gotta make it up, make it up to me

I don't cry no tears for free
How you gonna make it up to me?
I don't cry no tears for free
How you gonna make it up to me?
Gotta make it up, make it up to me
Gotta make it up, make it up to me
Gotta make it up, make it up to me
Gotta make it up, make it up to me
