Oh

Readymade, readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade, readymade
And this is how the story goes

I got a cousin making beats
Deep down in Arizona
We're gonna rocket to Ramone's
In the city of Pomona

Readymade, readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade, readymade
And this is how the story goes

(Oh)
And if I give to you my second sight, you got it
(Oh)
And if I stay the course I'll stay the night, come get it

Readymade, readymade
Baby oughta celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate

I got a sister makin' babies
With a black and decker blowtorch
We gonna flop it all night
In the middle of her back porch

Readymade, readymade
Get me out to celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate

(Oh)
And if I give to you my second sight, you got it
(Oh)
And if I stay the course, I'll stay the night, come get it

Oh clean it up Johnny!

Readymade, readymade
Rockin' for the sake of slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen but don't be afraid

I got a brother makin' trouble
in the state of Caledonia
I wish I knew another way
but I'm gonna have to clone ya
Readymade, readymade
Rock it for the sake of slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen, but don't be afraid
(Oh)
And if I give to you my second sight, you got it
(Oh)
And if I stay the course I'll stay the night, come get it.
