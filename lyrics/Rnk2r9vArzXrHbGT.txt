Climb the cliff, Tower over all
And falling water, falling waterfall

And after all my plans
They melt into the sand
Yeah you will be there on my mind through all
Don't want to understand why you never get older

It's time to dry off tattered overalls
Impatient waiting, Way to hide a fall

And after all my plans
They melt into the sand
Yeah you will be there on my mind through all
Don't want to understand why you never get older

And after all my plans
They melt into the sand
Yeah you will be there on my mind through all
Don't want to understand why you never get older

After all my plans
They melt into the sand
Yeah you will be there on my mind through all
Don't want to understand why you never get older

And after all my plans
They melt into the sand
Yeah you will be there on my mind through all
Don't want to understand why you never get older
