It's a long way to happiness, a long way to go
But I'm gonna get there, boy, the only way I know
Cause it's a long way to happiness, a long way to go
But I'm gonna get there, boy, the only way I know

It's a long way to happiness, a long way to go
But I'm gonna get there, boy, the only way I know
Cause it's a long way to happiness, a long way to go
But I'm gonna get there, boy, the only way I know

It's a long way to happiness, a long way to go
But I'm gonna get there, boy, the only way I know
Cause it's a long way to happiness, a long way to go
But I'm gonna get there, boy, the only way I know

It's a long way to happiness
And when we get there, is anybody scared?

For happiness, for happiness, for happiness, for happiness
For happiness, for happiness, for happiness, for happiness
For happiness, for happiness, for happiness, for happiness
For happiness, for happiness, for happiness, for happiness
