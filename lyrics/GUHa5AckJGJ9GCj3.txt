You sent out an S.O.S, I'm responding
Emergency unit's on the case
Another heartbreak has got you hurting
Hold on, the help is on the way

If there's a lifeline to, help you make it through
And lift you up every time you fall
I'll be the lifeline to, come and rescue you
If you need me, I will answer when you call

So say eh oh, eh oh
Come on and just let it go
I wanna stand with you against the odds
Let me be the one, that you can trust

Say eh oh, eh oh
Come on and let me know
We don't have to run against the odds
We have a lifeline right in front of us

Say eh oh, eh oh
Say eh oh, eh oh
Say eh oh, eh oh
Eh oh

All your hope and dreams came crashing down, down,
It's hard to face the day
Hold on and listen for the sound, sound, sound
Of my love it's on the way

If there's a lifeline to, help you make it through
And lift you up every time you fall
I'll be the lifeline to, come and rescue you
If you need me, I will answer when you call

So say eh oh, eh oh
Come on and just let it go
I wanna stand with you against the odds
Let me be the one, that you can trust

Say eh oh, eh oh

We have a lifeline right in front of us

Yeah, no more hiding
I'm here to keep you safe, from the cold
I hear you crying, now I'm pleading
You don't have to walk this road all alone
