The blade of my knife
Faced away from your heart
Those last few nights
It turned and sliced you apart
This love that I tell
Now feels lonely as hell
From this padded prison cell

So many times I said
You'd only be mine
I gave my blood and my tears
And loved you, cyanide
When you took my lips
I took your breath
Sometimes love's better off dead

You're all I need
Make you only mine
(I loved you)
So I set you free
I had to take your life

(You're all I need)
You're all I need
You're all I need
And I loved you so
But you didn't love me

Laid out cold
Now we're both alone
But killing you
Helped me keep you home
I guess, it was bad
'Cause love can be sad
But we finally made the news

Tied up smiling
I thought you were happy
Never opened your eyes
I thought you were napping
Well, I got so much to learn
About love in this world
But we finally made the news

You're all I need
Make you only mine
(I loved you)
So I set you free
I had to take your life

(You're all I need)
You're all I need
You're all I need
And I loved you so
So I put you to sleep
You're all I need
Make you only mine
(You're all I need)
repeat
to fade
