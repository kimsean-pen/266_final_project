Destroy the voices that cripple me
I realize I'm in everything
Can't change the past but what I hold in my
Hands is the light of myself. I finally understand
Death to oppression on every level
For my life I will never settle
Far too long I sabotaged myself
To believe that what sets me free is up to someone else

You yourself have to decide
Will you consume or block out the light?
Your mind, the anchor or the way which you see
You just have to believe

You are free
No matter what they do or what they say
Believe, you are free
The true power of you can't be taken away
Believe, you are free
Inward and out
You are free
Destroy the doubt
You are free
No matter what they say the true power of you can't be taken away

Never forget what is doesn't have to be

No matter what they do or what they say
Believe, you are free
The true power of you can't be taken away
Believe, you are free
Inward and out
You are free
Destroy the doubt
You are free
No matter what they say the true power of you can't be taken away

You have to decide
