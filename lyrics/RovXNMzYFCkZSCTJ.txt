I put my head down on my desk
To help me get through all this mess
I fell asleep and before I was done
I woke up in shock my whole arm was numb
I woke up in shock my whole arm was numb
I woke up in shock my whole arm was numb

I woke up in shock -

I fell asleep on my arm!
And now it's totally numb!
I fell asleep on my arm!
My shoulder's just a big limp stump!
I fell asleep on my arm!
My arm's like a big limp stump!

The bell rang, class dismissed
I'm sitting here a little bit dissed
I stepped to the door,
But I can't leave
I can't feel the doorknob, my arm's asleep
I can't feel the doorknob, my arm's asleep
Who's gonna carry my books?
I'm so embarrassed
What if I have to pee?
I can't bear it!
What if I have to pee?
I can't bear it!

I fell asleep on my arm!
And now it's totally numb!
I fell asleep on my arm!
My arm's like a big limp stump!
I fell asleep on my arm!
And now it's totally numb!
I fell asleep on my arm!
My arm's like a big limp stump!

Corporate America makes pencils
For the man with the left hand
They make pencils for the man with the right hand
But what about the man with the numb hand?
Four hundred grand to see The Rage
From back here I can't see the stage
It's time to start my own parade
So lift up your arm and wave

I fell asleep on my arm!
And now it's totally numb!
I fell asleep on my arm!
My shoulder's just a big limp stump!
I fell asleep on my arm!
My arm's like a big limp stump!

I feel no pain
In my arm
I feel no pain
In my arm
When's it gonna change?
It feels so strange
It's just one of those days
In my arm
I'm gonna slam it in the door
I'm gonna wiggle it around
'Cause I feel no pain
In my arm
It feels so strange
It's just one of those days:

Boom da bop da boom ba diggy diggy:
