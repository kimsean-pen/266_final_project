Bring it to your lips and experience
The sulfur infect everything that we've created
Don't twist this around
Don't attempt to justify what we know is wrong
Tendons are torn and screams are released
Into a poisoned, mathematic atmosphere

We're composing our funeral songs, note, (note) note by note (by note)
We're composing our funeral songs, note, (note) note by note (by note)

With this I declare that tomorrow is an allusion

What if the clouds are fragments of mistakes,
Fabricated by the factors of our foolishness?

We're composing our funeral songs, note (note) note by note (by note)
We're composing our funeral songs, note (note) note by note

Prove me wrong!
Prove me wrong!
Prove me wrong!
