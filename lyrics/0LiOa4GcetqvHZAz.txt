All of the neighbors decided it's time
To have all our strangers over and make friends
Chris got a pony keg of loose charm
I had an accident, I hurt my arm

People from bands and labels, the good ones
Plenty of stunning children, East Bay
You were from Oakland by way of the Midwest
I bought a rose and a suit with the pants pegged

You said I smelled you twice today
Someone was passing out somewhere
We kissed a shot of Kentucky straight
I swore this life is worth the wait

Hayes broke the scissors, apologized
Our kitchen was crowded and steamy, isn't it always?

I just looked deeper into you
You bit my neck blue
We hung our clothes up on the floor
And put our faith in a closed door

We're having this party
Please come
It won't be the same without you
Please come
