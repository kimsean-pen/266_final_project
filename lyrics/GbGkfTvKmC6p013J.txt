You'll never know
The weight of it
But it's too much for me
It's pulling me underneath
You like the way
Feels to love me
'til it's uncomfortable
'til you have to risk it all

I don't wanna
Change your mind
Now it's made
I don't wanna fix it
There's no solution
I don't wanna
Change your mind
Now its made
It's better that
We don't say
Anything more about it

Nothing breaks like a human heart
And nothing hurts
There's nothing left
When it falls apart
It's when the feeling stops

If I let you down
At least I let you loving
When you needed me
I wouldn't be o ut of reach
In the circumstance
You must be feeling something
In the space we leave
In the in-between

I don't wanna
Change your mind
Now it's made
I don't wanna fix it
There's no solution
I don't wanna
Change your mind
Now its made
It's better that
We don't say
Anything more about it

Nothing breaks like a human heart
And nothing hurts
There's nothing left
When it falls apart
It's when the feeling stops

Felt like nothing else
Ever made a mark
When is there hope
Now nothing breaks like a human heart
And you will...
