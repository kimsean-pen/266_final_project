Like a crack in the clean slate
I see emotion take over the rational
We are the favoured sons of reason
With tools at our disposal
Squandered day by day

Strip the thoughts
Heal the system
Take the original back
It is inside me
It is inside me now
If this is all I can remember
Can I ever trust myself

Like a flash or a fleeting glance
I see movement in the corner of my eye
Now the mind goes into overdrive
To process and deceive
How will I ever know

Give up the experience
To halt the fictional mind
It is inside me
It is inside me now
Block out all that makes it painful
Set the pieces back in place

I track movement
Like light behind my eyes
Made to match up
With what I tell myself each day
My experience
Is what I do not know
And one I cannot trust

It infects the marrow
A virus of ideas
It is inside me
It is inside me now
What my mind is telling me
Must come undone
