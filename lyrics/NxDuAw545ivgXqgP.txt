Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air
Oh oh, it's a passion
Oh oh, you can feel it in the air
Oh oh, It's a passion
Oh oh, oh, oh, oh

(This is the rhythm)

You can put some joy up on my face
Oh sunshine in an empty place
Take me too, turn to
And babe I'll make you stay
(Oh yeah)

Oh I can ease you of your pain
Feel you give me love again
Round and round we go
Each time I hear you say

This is the rhythm of the night
The night
Oh yeah
The rhythm of the night
This is the rhythm of my life
My life
Oh yeah
The rhythm of my life

This is the rhythm of the night
The night
Oh yeah
The rhythm of the night
This is the rhythm of my life
My life
Oh yeah
The rhythm of my life

Won't you teach me how to love and learn?
There'll be nothing left for me to yearn
Think of me and burn
And let me hold your hand
(Oh yeah)

I don't want to face the world in tears
Please think again, I'm on my knees
Sing that song to me
No reason to repent

This is the rhythm of the night
The night
Oh yeah
The rhythm of the night
This is the rhythm of my life
My life
Oh yeah
The rhythm of my life

This is the rhythm of the night
The night
Oh yeah
The rhythm of the night
This is the rhythm of my life
My life
Oh yeah
The rhythm of my life

This is the rhythm of the night
The night
Oh yeah
The rhythm of the night
This is the rhythm of my life
My life
Oh yeah
The rhythm of my life

This is the rhythm of the night
The night
Oh yeah
