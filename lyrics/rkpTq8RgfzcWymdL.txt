I learned a lot about you in a day at school
you gotta think about the energy
and tell us that you try to (conclude) your day at school
I learned a lot about you in a day at school
I think that people knew what it was

Well I had a little slippi
And I held it as a baby
And I wanna pick a mommy
Cause I'm sentimental slippi
Well I'm gonna raise a family
And I gotta have a baby
And she'll have a little slippi
And she'll say oh my little slippi little slippi

I could cheer up the tear that I hide from Mr. (--)
she's not growing up, we want music with our eyes closed

I feel all right I think we've been a bit (tasteless)

And I'm shouting cause you're naked AHHHH!
But the children better listen AHHHH!
Cause your memory's gonna riot AHHH!
And you'll be shootin' paranoia AHHH!
So don't you ever start your cryin Ahhh!
Keep on shouting cause you're naked Ahhh!
And your lives'll make you crazy Ahhh!
When your fortune shoots a lie up on your list so keep it up
with the tear that I hide from Mr. (--)
She's got wisdom like wise old babies
With their eyes closed
