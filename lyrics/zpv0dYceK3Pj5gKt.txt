Next motherfucker's gonna get my metal
I bring you
Bring dead
On we plow
The big bully try to stick his finger in my chest

Try to tell me, tell me he's the best
But I don't really give a good goddamn 'cause
I got my lunchbox and I'm armed real well

I got my lunchbox and I'm armed real well
I got my lunchbox and I'm armed real well
I wanna grow up
I wanna be a big rock and roll star
I wanna grow up

I wanna be so no one fucks with me
I got the pencils in my pocket, try to put me down
Wanna go out, gotta get down
To the playground, gonna throw down at the playground

I wanna go out
Next motherfucker gonna get my metal
Next motherfucker gonna get my metal
Next motherfucker gonna get my metal

Next motherfucker gonna get my metal
Pow pow pow
Pow pow pow
Pow pow pow

I wanna grow up
I wanna be a big rock and roll star
I wanna grow up
I wanna be so no one fucks with me

Yeah, I wanna grow up
I wanna be a big rock and roll star
I wanna grow up
I wanna be so no one fucks with me, yeah
I wanna grow up
I wanna be a big rock and roll star
I wanna grow up
I wanna be so no one fucks with me, yeah
