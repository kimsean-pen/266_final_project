We never talked about it, but I hear the blame was mine
I'd called you up to say I'm sorry
But I wouldn't want to waste your time
Cause I love you, but I can't take anymore
There's a look I can't describe in your eyes
If we could try like we tried before
Would you keep on telling me those lies
Telling me lies
Do you remember

Well, do you remember
Do you remember
There seemed no way to make up
Cause it seemed your mind was set
And the way you looked it told me
It's a look I know I'll never forget
You could've come over to my side
You could've let me know

You could've tried to see the distance between us

But it seemed too far for you to go

So far to go
Do you remember

Oh, do you remember

Do you remember
Through all of my life

In spite of all the pain
You know that people are funny sometimes
They just can't wait to get hurt again
Tell me, do you remember
Do you remember
There are things we won't recall
And feelings we'll never find
It's taken so long to see it
Cause we never seemed to have the time
There was always something more important to do
More important to say
But "I love you" wasn't one of those things
And now it's too late
Now it's too late
Now it's too late
Now it's over
Do you remember
Oh, its over
Oh, do you remember
Now it's over
Do you remember
Tell me, do you remember
Now it's over
Well, do you remember
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me now, tell me now
Do you remember
Now it's over
