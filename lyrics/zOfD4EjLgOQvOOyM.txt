Should I stay
Should I go
Should I run far away
To the point that I cant even see the universe
I know I'm killing time
And baby that's not fine

I'll pack it in, pack it in
Never smoke anything
Never eat anything
That will compromise my health
And, baby that means you, too
that means you

It's impossible to pin-point
You were like a fat joint
I cannot remember
You back in November
Never gonna allocate
All of this dark hate
Stuck in the middle
Middle of it

Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
For lent
Take a break
Pack it in
Take it out to the bin
Isn't it counterfeit?
Take a hit
A little bit
Wasn't it not worth it

I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna even know
Why you haven't
Why you haven't even sold our band of gold
Isn't it counterfeit?
Take a hit
A little bit
Wasn't it not worth it

Slip up – faux pas
yet another mistake
When we blunder all I see
Is another thunderstorm
Brewing above the house of
Anarchy we share
When we have a visitor
They are visibly disturbed
The don't want to hang around
In the company of you and I
And I don't blame them one iota
No I don't

It's impossible to pin-point
You were like a fat joint
I cannot remember
You back in December
Never gonna dissipate
All of this black hate
Stuck in the middle
Middle of it all

Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
For lent
Take a break
Pack it in
Take it out to the bin
Isn't it counterfeit?
Take a hit
A little bit
Wasn't it not worth it

I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna even know
Why you haven't
Why you haven't even sold our band of gold
Isn't it counterfeit?
Take a hit
A little bit
Wasn't it not worth it

I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
Be your personal assistant
You'll meet my resistance everyday – ooooh

What's it gonna take
To make it crytal clear to you
We are through
I'm angrily surprised at you!

I don't wanna, I don't wanna
Be like this back then
Yes maybe – now it's crazy
We're not good for one another
No, no, no

I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna act like this
You know I wanna be free
I want to be free
I want to be free

Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
For lent
Take a break
Pack it in
Take it out to the bin
Isn't it counterfeit?
Take a hit
A little bit
Wasn't it not worth it
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna even know
Why you haven't
Why you haven't even sold our band of gold
Isn't it counterfeit?
Take a hit
A little bit
Wasn't it not worth it
Ooooh oooooh
