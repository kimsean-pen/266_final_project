Oh, but I know you'll cause me grief
Close friends of mine are in disbelief
As they can see what's underneath
Fluttering lashes, red lips and pearly white teeth

I don't show it but I quiver whenever you come near
And I cannot decipher between the thrill and the fear
I want to stop it but I like it too much to let it stop here
It's wrong but I want you tonight
It's not my own volition but I fell in deep
By running the distance I'd been advised to keep
I trot to the wolf as a doting and sheep
It's wrong but I want you tonight

Fear and delight
All the way through the night
With a little daring do
I'll fall in love with you

I'm the little boy that's gonna be getting fingers burned
But I can see this lesson's gotta, gotta, gotta be learned
They say that boys have been destroyed but they weren't
it's wrong but I want you tonight
In any case, my friends, it's too late
Like a moth to light, like a beast to bate
and I know the black widow eats its mate
It's wrong but I want you tonight

Fear and delight
All the way through the night
With a little daring do
I'll fall in love with you

I'm an innocent being seduced by your charms
I'm a young boy tickled to death in your arms
Your kisses taste like bitter almonds
It's wrong but I want you tonight
You're an addiction pulling me to a grave end
You're an enemy who I'm keen to defend
Down the black hole of my lust I descend
It's wrong but I want you tonight

Fear and delight
All the way through the night
With a little daring do
I'll fall in love with you

Why is it that I'm keen to be devoured by you
When there's the option of a love affair that's pure and true
I always choose the dungeon over the sea view
It's wrong but I want you tonight
When I'm out the other side I say never again
But when I'm out and about about I want to find the next vixen
Someone who'll be sure to drive me 'round the bend
It's wrong but I want you tonight

Fear and delight
All the way through the night
With a little daring do
I'll fall in love with you
