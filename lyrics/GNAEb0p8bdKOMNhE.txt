I thought the destruction
Of creation
Would be nuclear power
And radiation

I thought judgement
Would come
When dem drop
De neutron bomb

And man was heading
For extinction with
With contraceptive pills
That was made to kill
Legal murder
They call abortion

I thought the invention
Of robots yes yeh
All forms of life
Would eventually stop

But now dem dog gone crazy
Mass producing test tube babies

CHORUS
Oil a wild goose chase
Laws of nature they just can't face
Ambition is to mash up the place
Who shall save the human race?

Chemicals in the food
To control population
intentions to build
A plastic nation

Cloning cats to have dogs
Human beings breeding hogs
On the moon in search of aliens
But now dem dog gone crazy
Mass producing test tube babies

CHORUS
On a wild goose chase
Laws of nature they just can't face
Ambition is to mash up the place
Who shall save the human race?

These times of science and technology
This world is an unconscious lavatory
Using my people as guinea pigs
I man a fight it spiritually

Soon the old will inject
Themselves to keep young
Ain't no telling what they do next
All I know that JAH must vex
0 righteous one keep in check
Thunder will roll and break wicked neck

CHORUS
On a wild goose chase
Laws of nature they just can't face
Ambition is to mash up the place
Tell me who shall save de HUMAN RACE?
