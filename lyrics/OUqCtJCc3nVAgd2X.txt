There's a heart that beats inside of me
Where the time flies and the stars shine
It throes and pounds just like a drum machine
Where your dreams lie by the seaside

You were shouting out something
You were shouting out something
Hop around the world, we are dancing in the sun

You were shouting out something
You were shouting out something
Nothing is sacred
We just take what we can and run

Facts are much better than make-believe
And the coin falls, as a voice calls
Our souls are made of love and energy
Like a raindrop on a snowball

You were shouting out something
You were shouting out something
Hop around the world, we are dancing in the sun

You were shouting out something
You were shouting out something
Nothing is sacred
We just take what we can and run
Dancing in the sun

You were shouting out something
You were shouting out something
Hop around the world, we are dancing in the sun
Dancing in the sun

You were shouting out something
You were shouting out something
Nothing is sacred
We just take what we can and run
Dancing in the sun
Dancing in the sun
