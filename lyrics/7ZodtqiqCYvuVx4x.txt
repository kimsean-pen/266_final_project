Scrape the bottom of your brain
Pack it in and take a breath and fuck the pain again
Pass the past into the trash
And let the future get the greens and let the good times last again

Wait for me to fill this up and watch you slide
Wait for me to fill this up and watch you slip into the grip of the grim reefer
Just let him slip into a new reverb
He won't let you leave without his herb
Because he loves you and he doesnt wanna see you hurt

He's watching you
He's watching you slide
He's watching you
He's watching you slide
