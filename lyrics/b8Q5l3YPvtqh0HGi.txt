I was bored of watching TV
Sat out on the porch nightly
Taking pictures on the phone
Of people passing by

Then I saw the kind of show
I could never tell my man
Waiting for Shadow Shows Diane
Waiting for Shadow Shows Diane

I look into windows see the people, well
I want to be someone sane sometimes, somebody else
I want to be someone sane sometimes, somebody else

I am looking through and playing
Window roulette for days

Thought I saw them seeing me across the way
I know it's crazy to keep this from my man
Waiting for Shadow Shows Diane
Waiting for Shadow Shows Diane

I look into windows see the people, well
I want to be someone sane sometimes, somebody else
I want to be someone sane sometimes, somebody else
I want to be someone sane sometimes, somebody else...
I want to be someone sane sometimes, somebody else...
