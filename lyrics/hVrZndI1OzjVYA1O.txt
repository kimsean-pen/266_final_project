Baby, let me know if you're cold, you can have my sweater
You call me up in pieces, I'll put you back together
I'm trying to pretend, keep my head above the water
It's hard to keep control, if your pocket's full of stones in the river

So hold on
Stay strong
My love
I try so hard

But don't you know I need
Don't you know I need help too?
Don't you know I need
Don't you know I need help too?

I'm calling out your name, but my lungs are full of the ocean
I'm reaching for your hand, never knew I'd such devotion
I'll find you in a place in the dark, never knew existed
Been hanging on so tight on you, now I see the blisters

So hold on
Stay strong
My love
I try so hard

But don't you know I need
Don't you know I need help too?
Don't you know I need
Don't you know I need help too?

As long as I am breathing
Please, don't ever leave me
I could never leave you now

Don't you know I need
Don't you know I need help too?
Help too
Help too

In my head a thousand words
I don't want to cause you trouble
Without you I'm just a girl
No reward without the struggle
I've tried so hard

But don't you know I need
Don't you know I need help too?
Don't you know I need
Don't you know I need help too?

As long as I am breathing
Please, don't ever leave me
I could never leave you now

Don't you know I need
Don't you know I need help too?
Help too
Help too
Help too
Help too
Help too
Help too
Help too
Help too
