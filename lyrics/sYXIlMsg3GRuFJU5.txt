Been waiting at this crossroads forever and a day
And no guy to buy my soul
I've spend all night and day, how much outro can I play?
You know I gave my life to rock 'n roll

Mama, begged me, please
Yes, she got down on her knees
Said you'd burn in that Mississippi sun
But I'm the only one who's standing here
So, mama don't you have no fear
I'm either last or I've already won
Here I go!

Take me down, take me down
Take me down, won't you take me down?!

Standing at the crossroads, would draw a pen in hand
The conversation went like this:
"Tell me your desire, why you pulled me from the fire?"
"And we'll seal the deal with a kiss"
Don't wanna waste the dead
Find a note that I can shred on my walls
I scroll my Gods
Don't care what happens when I die as long as I'm alive
All in wanna do is rock, rock, ro-o-o-o-ck!!

Take me down, take me down
Take me down, won't you take me down?!

Signed with the Devil
Signed with the Devil
Signed with the Devil
Oh
Signed with the Devil
Signed with the Devil
Signed with the Devil
Oh

Signed with the Devil
Signed with the Devil
Signed with the Devil
Oh
Signed with the Devil
Signed with the Devil
Signed with the Devil
O-o-o-oh

Take me down, take me down
Take me down, won't you take me down?!

Take me down, take me down
Take me down, won't you take me down?!
