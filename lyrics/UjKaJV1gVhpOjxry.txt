You think you know me
And everything that you consider me
You think you know my name

You think you know me
And everything you get a chance to see
You think you know my face
You think you know my face

You think you see me
And everything that you consider me
You think I? m more than you

You think you see me
Like the way I? m strong and stand by you
I am fragile too, I am fragile too

Yeah, I will be fine
As the time goes by
It may hurt at nights
But I will be fine
I will be just fine

They think they know me
And everything that they consider me
They think I never cry

They are thinking
While they? re making up their twisted lies
She won't mind, she is nice
She's as cold as ice

You think you see me
And everything that you consider me
You think I? m more than you

You think you see me
Like the way I? m strong and stand by you
But I am fragile too, I am fragile too
I am fragile too, I am fragile too
Just like you
