Its gonna take a bit of work
Oh oh work
Now that you're here
Whoa oh work
Cause people come and go
But I think you should know
That I
I think this will work
Ooooooooo
Ooooooooo
It's gonna take a little time
But with you by my side
I won't let go
Till I got what's mine
Cause people come and go
But you should know
That I, that I
I will take it slow
Ooooooooo
It's gonna take a bit of work
Oh, oh work
Now that you're here
Whoa oh work
It's gonna take a bit of work
Oh, oh work
Now that you're here
Whoa oh work
