Well, it started with your hips,
So I moved up to your lips
To take a chance, ask for a dance,
Cause you're the cutest thing on this side of the world.
We call our homes,
Yet I feel so all alone half of the time.
We gotta live with what we got,
And I got nothin'
So I pray you take my hand so we can conjure up somethin' rad.

And you could move on with your whole life,
Just like you do, just like you shoobie-doo-doo-too
But you could make everything alright
And I want you to
Because ever since the first dance
All I thought about was lovin' on you.

So I moved to the dance floor
With instincts and nothing more.
I had ants in my pants; I did the boogie dance,
And there was nothing to do but laugh.
So I took another leap, hoping to sweep you off your feet.
I said, baby maybe we could bust this joint,
And see if my place is open to chill.

And you could move on with your whole life
Just like you do, just like you shoobie-doo-doo-too
But you could make everything alright
And I want you to
Because ever since the first dance
All I thought about was lovin' on you.

And you could move on with your whole life
Just like you do, just like you shoobie-doo-doo-too
But you could make everything alright
And I want you to
Because ever since the first dance
All I thought about was lovin' on you.
