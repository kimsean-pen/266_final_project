Don't lie, don't lie to me now
Now I'm erasing you
Throwing those memories out
Out to start something new
I'm throwing those memories

Darling, don't lie to me
Darling, don't lie to me
Darling, don't lie to me
Darling don't...

Breathe in slowly now
Darling don't lie to me
Breathe in slowly now
Darling don't lie to me
Inhale truth I plead
For you're my only hope
Don't lie, don't leave

Mind set on failure
The road you chose
Told me you loved me
Told me, no

Take your time I'm only dying
Patiently I kneel here dying
Curse the blind, you curse the blind
Deep inside is where it lies

Don't mind me, I'm only dying
Don't mind me, I'm only dying
(What got me into this mess that devoured me)
Don't mind me, I'm only dying
Don't mind me, I'm only dying
(Lies and deceitful actions keep promising)

What got me into this mess that devoured me (darling, don't lie)
Lies and deceitful actions keep promising (darling, don't lie)
What got me into this mess that devoured me (darling, don't lie)
Lies and deceitful actions keep promising (darling don't lie)
