U-uh!
Dark meditation
Your second sight
Can show my light
In a crystal ball

Sweet are the days
Intoxication
Crow-black the nights
Caging my mind
Behind the wall

Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Into the rock to find the cream
Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Pictured life from yesterday

Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Into the rock to find the cream
Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Pictured life from yesterday

U-uh!
Dark meditation
Deep down inside
A stream of light
Begins to flow

Sweet are the days
Intoxication
Crow-black the nights
Caging my mind
Behind the wall

Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Into the rock to find the cream
Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Pictured life from yesterday

Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Into the rock to find the cream
Into the rock through walls of red dreams
Pictured life from yesterday

Pictured life
Pictured life
Pictured life from yesterday
