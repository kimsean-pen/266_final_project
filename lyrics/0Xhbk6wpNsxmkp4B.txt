I see the city and it isn't
What it used to be
A million houses goin'
Up and down in front of me
No time to let the concrete set
Before it's broken up again
Don't care if it's historic
Don't really care at all

A hidden landscape
On the brink of any development
A protest rally never
Satisfied with development
Both strivin' for a perfect world
Each havin' their own opinions
And so the city grows
It grows on and on

All torn down
All torn down
All torn

I see the city and it's grown
Into a big machine
The streets are freeways
And the parks are just a memory
No time to let the concrete set
Before it's broken up again
Don't care if it's historic
Don't really care at all

All torn down
All torn down
All torn
You got no reason
You got no reason
You got no reason
You got no reason
No

I see the city and it isn't
What it used to be
A million houses goin'
Up and down in front of me
No time to let the concrete set
Before it's broken up again
Don't care if it's historic
Don't really care at all

All torn down
All torn down
All torn
