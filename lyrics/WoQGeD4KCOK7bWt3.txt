Gonna take a sentimental journey
Gonna set my heart at ease
Gonna make a sentimental journey
To renew old memories
Got my bag and got my reservation
Spent each dime I could afford
Like a child in wild anticipation
I long to hear that all aboard!
Seven, that's the time we leave, at seven
I'll be waitin' up for heaven
Countin' every mile of railroad track
That takes me back
Never thought my heart could be so yearny
Why did I decide to roam?
I gonna take a sentimental journey
Sentimental journey home
Seven, that's the time we leave, at seven
I'll be waitin' up for heaven
Countin' every mile of railroad track
That takes me back
Never thought my heart could be so yearny
Why did I decide to roam?
I gonna take the sentimental journey
Sentimental journey home
Sentimental journey home
Sentimental journey home
