Why can't I walk down a street free of suggestion? (repeat)
Is my body my only trait in the eyes of men? (in the eyes of men)

I've got some skin
You want to look in

There lays no reward in what you discover
You spent yourself watching me suffer
Suffer your words, suffer you eyes, suffer your hands
Suffer your interpretation of what it is to be a man

I've got some skin
You want to look in

She does nothing to deserve it
He only wants to observe it
We sit back like they taught us
We keep quiet like they taught us

He just wants to prove it
She does nothing to remove it
We don't want anyone to mind us
So we play the roles that they assigned us

She does nothing to conceal it
He touches her 'cause he wants to feel it
We blame her for being there
But we are all guilty
