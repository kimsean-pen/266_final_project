Kill it with love
Kill it with kindness
Kill it with reason
Be more like me

Be like your friends
Be like your mother
Be like your father
Be more like me

When love feels dead
And you got yours so, ha!
When love feels dead
And you got yours so
Pick up the feeling then let it drop

Turn off your phone
Turn off the TV
Turn off your feelings
Be more like me

Be like your mother
Be like your father
Be like your friends
Be more like me

When love feels dead
And you got yours so, ha!
When love feels dead
And you got yours so
Pick up the feeling then let it drop

Better, it feels better, it feels better, it feels better, it feels better, it feels better, it feels better when I let it drop

Kill it with love
Kill it with kindness
Kill it with feeling
Be more like me

Be like your mother
Be like your father
Be like your friends
Be more like me

When love feels dead
And you got yours so, ha!
When love feels dead
And you got yours so
Pick up the feeling then let it drop

Drop
