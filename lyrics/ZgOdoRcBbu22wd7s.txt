Baby, are you home alone?
I need to know if we're still on
I know we've been hurting lately
You see, you came in like a thunderstorm
Electric shivers shooting through my bones
You make my heart start beating in my chest
Baby, hold tight
Baby, I just wanna know
Am I still the one you think you know?
Cause you kept me anticipating
Just tell me what you need, dear
And baby, that's what I'll do
You make my heart start beating in my chest
Baby, hold tight
You make my heart start beating in my chest
Baby, hold tight
Baby, I just wanna know
There's a ghost in my bed
The place you once rest your head
Don't fight it
Baby, I just wanna know
Just come home, this is where you belong
Don't fight it, don't fight it
Baby, are you home alone?
I need to know if we're still on
Don't fight it
I know we've been hurting lately
You see, you came in like a thunderstorm (You came in)
Electric shivers shooting through my bones (You came in)
You make my heart start beating in my chest
Baby, hold tight
Don't fight it
Baby, hold tight
Don't fight it
Baby, hold tight
Don't fight it
Baby, hold tight
Don't fight it
Baby, hold tight
