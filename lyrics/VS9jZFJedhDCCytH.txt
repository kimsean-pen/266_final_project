If you could spit it out, if you could only shout.
When you open your mouth pull the trigger with your tongue.
But your heart goes numb, no, you can't make a sound.

You can never break the silence in your heart, in your heart.
You can never break the silence, it's in your bones, in your bones.

Even if you break your heart, you set your soul apart.
Into the self aware you're just a quiet kid
It's all you can do not to blow your head, without make you insane.

You can never break the silence in your heart, in your heart.
You can never break the silence, it's in your bones, in your bones.

You can never break the silence in your heart, in your heart.
You can never break the silence, it's in your bones, in your bones.
You can never break the silence.
