After the rain
A killer crane
After the rainbow

Across the sky
Her grace is glide
Across the sea

Across creation
And over time
Her grace she slides
Escapes station

A cold wind blows
The day this stows
Glown heart glownation

Leave it behind
Your restless mind
Your jelousies
But isolation
Demands your patience

To be found together in time just to say

Sunshine I saw you through the hanging vine
A memory of what is mine fading away
But this night heals the?
And the moonlight steals the sound
I could leave suddenly unafraid

And after all
We're free to fall
Once all the pain goes
And how we stood
And what was good
Could lie us all long

In isolation
A transformation

Blue laughter leaves me
Leaves me blue
And all the? to see it through
This laugh of love and lie tingle
A killer crane
After the rainbow

May they found together in time to say

Sunshine I saw you through the hanging vine
A memory of what was mine fading away
But this night heals the
And the moonlight steals the sound
I could leave suddenly unafraid

Sunshine come crawling through the hanging vines
A memory of what is mine fading away
In this night heals the
And the moonlight steals the sound
I could leave suddenly unafraid

Sunshine I saw you through the hanging vine
A memory of what is mine fading away
And this night heals the
And the moonlight steals the sound
I could leave suddenly unafraid
