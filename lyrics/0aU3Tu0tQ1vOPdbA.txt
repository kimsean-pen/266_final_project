I wanna find an apartment in San Francisco
Spend all my money on cigarettes and vintage clothes
You thought I had it too good but life isn't simple
Like San Francisco

God, the feeling is so nice
No one screwing with my time
I was so numb and it was so dumb
Back in the place that I come from
Someone opened a window
And I got out before you knew
I was so numb and I was giving up

I got this glow in the city that I love
I get the feeling that you did not see it coming
And now you're dreaming alone
'Cause I'm not coming home

I met a boy
Like hanging out on the west coast
Paying for nothing
I'm always wearing Moschino
It's the first time that I've never felt like a zero
In San Francisco

God, the feeling is so nice
No one screwing with my time
I was so dumb and it was so numb
Back in the place that I come from
Someone opened a window and I got out before you knew
I was so numb and I was giving up

I got this glow in the city that I love
I get the feeling that you did not see it coming
And now you're dreaming alone
'Cause I'm not coming home
('Cause I'm not coming home)

Giving in, giving in to the impulse
And I know, and I know it was so close
But somewhere we just grew up, boy

Giving in, giving in to the impulse
And I know, and I know it was so close
But somewhere we just grew up, boy

I got this glow in the city that I love
I get the feeling that you did not see it coming
And now you're dreaming alone
'Cause I'm not coming home
('Cause I'm not coming home)

I'm gonna find an apartment in San Francisco
Spend all my money on cigarettes and vintage clothes
You thought I had it too good but life isn't simple
Like San Francisco
