Please don't get involved
'Cause I don't want you helping
It is not my fault
That I don't want you helping
No

So I run away
When I run away
Ain't nobody gonna' find me
Patience everyday
No redemption could ever help me, no

So back into the past
I don't need nobody helping
Yeah

Now I feel OK
Molly wanna' flowing in my dome
I just wanna' say
All this money really cured my woes
Look around me now
Have(?) you even gone and helped me
'Cause baby I'm the man

Back into the past
I don't need nobody helping
Yeah
