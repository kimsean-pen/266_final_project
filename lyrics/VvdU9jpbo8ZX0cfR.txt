where are you now
have you travelled too far
and how are your dreams
have you got what you need

and whom do you smile on
did you walk out the line
did you take what you wanted
did you take what was right

and whom do you fly with
when you break out the day
whom do you cry with
whose wings do you steal
to whom should i write

whose smile do you ride on
when you're walking alone
and whom do you think of
when the night is your home
is there nothing that breaks you
no thought for the dead

and whom should i think of
when closing to door
yeah whom should i think of
which smile should i ride
oh to whom should i write
to whom should i write
to whom should i write
