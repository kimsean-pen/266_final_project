PART ONE:

It was the time of the preacher when the story began.
Of the choice of a lady and the love of a man.
How he loved her so dearly, he went out of his mind.
When she left him for someone, she'd left behind.

An' he cried like a baby;
He screamed like a panther in the middle of the night.
An' he saddled his pony,
An he went for a ride.

It was the time of the preacher in the year of 01.
Now the preachin' is over and the lesson's begun.

Instrumental close.
