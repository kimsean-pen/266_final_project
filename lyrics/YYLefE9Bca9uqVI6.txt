he's the invisible man
count the bubbles in your hand
the summer sites
and the southern skies

that's all that's left behind
the skies, and a sweet caress
he's the invisible man
catch him if you can

you're no where in site (just imagine that)
nothing excites you (baby that's a fact)
open your eyes
look and you will find

that's all that's left behind... the skies
and a sweet caress
the skies, the sights
and a sweet caress
he's the invisible man
catch him if you can

that's all that's left behind... the skies
and a sweet caress
the skies, the sights
and a sweet caress
he's the invisible man
catch him if you can
