(Nothing's gonna make you stop
You wanna rock
Everyone know's you're lost)

Morning light hurts your eyes
But that's another thing
Nothing really matters
Behind the shades of blue
Blind boys never lie
But that's another thing
Nothing really matters
Behind the shades of blue

'Cause in the end
You're just reborn again

You wanna rock (rock)
nothing's gonna make you stop
And nothing's gonna break you up
Everybody knows you're lost
In the night time, honey
Lost boys

We are dead until dark
But that's another thing
Nothing really matters
Behind the shades of blue
You say
You wanna live like I do
But that's another thing
Nothing really matters
Behind the shades of blue

'Cause in the end
We're just reborn again

You wanna rock (rock)
Nothing's gonna make you stop
And nothing's gonna break you up
Everybody knows you're lost
In the night time, honey
Lost boys

Nothing's gonna make you stop
And nothing's gonna break you up
Everybody knows you're lost
In the night time, honey
Lost boys

You wanna rock
Love's gonna make you stop
And nothing's gonna break you up
Everybody knows you're lost
In the night time, honey
Lost boys

Love's gonna make you stop
And nothing's gonna break you up
Everybody knows you're lost
In the night time, honey
Lost boys

Love's gonna make you stop
And nothing's gonna break you up
Everybody knows you're lost
In the night time, honey
Lost boys

(Nothing's gonna make you stop
Lost boys
Everybody knows you're lost
Lost boys)
