Thought I couldn't breathe without you, I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you, perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you, but I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you, but I'm livin'

Thought that I would fail without you, but I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now, but it won't stop
Thought that I would self destruct, but I'm still here
Even in my years to come, I'm still gon' be here

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder

I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder

I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'
