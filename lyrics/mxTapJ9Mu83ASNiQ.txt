Let's watch it burn
Let's watch it burn
Let's watch this city burn the world

Let's watch this city burn
From the skylines on top of the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world

My body doused in ash with two empty cans of gas
The only evidence they have is a police sketch of my mask
And it's hard at times to ask if you can save my heart for last
And it's hard to face the facts when the darkness fades to black
It's not just make-believe when they make me take a seat
And they put amphetamines in the air and make me breathe
So come on and grab your children, look out for burning buildings
And villains who pillage, they're killing by the millions
And billions of people die for a lost cause
So now I pray to my nation destroyed under God

It's the end of the world
All my battles have been won, but the war has just begun

Let's watch this city burn
From the skylines on top of the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world

The city looks so pretty, do you wanna burn it with me
Till the skies bleed ashes and the fucking skyline crashes?
They catch us with matches and ignite the flame
And all the hopes of a youth deemed fucking insane
They say: "take the pill, in God we trust, go and kill, God loves us
As in life, as in death, breathing till there is no breath"
I will not die in the night but in the light of the sun
With the ashes of this world in my lungs
But who am I to say? Let's all just run away
Grab your saints and pray, and we'll burn this world today!

It's the end of the world
As in heaven, as on earth, we've been dead since our birth

Let's watch this city burn
From the skylines on top of the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world

The city looks so pretty, do you wanna burn it with me?
The city looks so pretty, do you wanna burn it with me?
The city looks so pretty, do you wanna burn it with me?
The city looks so pretty, do you wanna burn it with me?
We'll use the trees as torches
We'll flood the streets with corpses
We'll watch the city fucking bleed
And bring the world to its knees
Do you wanna burn it with me?

Let's watch this city burn
From the skylines on top of the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world
Let's watch this city burn
From the skylines on top of the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world

Let's watch it burn
Let's watch it burn
Let's watch this city burn the world
