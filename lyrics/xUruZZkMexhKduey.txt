Stop here

this is for you as my lover was for nobody
as the rain that didn't wet you
as the sun that didn't warm you

stop here

this is for you you don't need to pay
because it didn't cost me anything
stop here & go away

take your time with you
i haven't the time for you
my feelings were fueled by yours
the walls that surrounded my city

stop here

this is for you as my lover was for nobody
you're a million & i've loved you
you're a million & i'm yours

we're a million to come
we're a million to go
