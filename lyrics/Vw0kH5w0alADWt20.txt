Laying down roots with the old souls singing for years you know
Giving their wisdom free to the earth and the falling snow
Only when we stop to hear it
Only when we stop to hear it
Only when we stop to hear it
I've been howling to the moon
But he won't let me go, let me go
I've been tasting freedoms reign
But he won't let me go, let me go
Let me go, Let me go, Let me go
Let me go, Let me go, Let me go
I heard it in the wind
Howling, howling, howling
Heard it in the wind
Howling, howling, howling
Howling, howling, howling
Heard it in the wind
