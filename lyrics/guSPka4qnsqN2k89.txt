Fire it up, let the engines roll
It's time to burn it down
Keep bleeding on till the day you die
Forever love it loud, yeah

Hellfire, doom, watch the hatred spin
Beyond the speed of sound
Fire it up, let the engines roll
It's time to burn it down, yeah

Keep moving on, keep moving on, keep moving on
Keep moving on, keep moving on, keep moving on

Face your fear, accept your war, it is what it is
Face your fear, accept your war, oh yeah!
