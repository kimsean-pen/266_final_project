On a county road
Under the purple sky
Fields of nothing
At our sides
The End of August
And into autumn
We stood at the edge
And watched the storm

The End of August
And into autumn
We prepare to get serious again

On a county road
Under the purple sky
Fields of nothing
At our sides
The End of August
And into autumn
We stood at the edge
And watched the storm

The End of August
And into autumn
A year from now I'll be so far away

On a county road
Under the purple sky
Fields of nothing
At our sides
The End of August
And into autumn
We stood at the edge
And watched the storm
