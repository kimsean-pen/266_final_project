It's the rise of the Vulture
I feel the panic
All those who are nervous
With loss of dynamic
Your blood's been poisoned
If your heart is sour
Hear the sound of the war drums
We're taking the power
(We're taking... the power)
We're taking the power
(We're taking... the power)

It's the rise of the Vulture
Gotta keep on climbing
No chance of escape
No use in hiding
Through the eye of the storm
With a silver lining
To the point where it breaks
Gonna keep on grinding
(We're taking... the power)
We're taking the power
(We're taking... the power)
