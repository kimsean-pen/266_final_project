Universe is turning inside out
Was there ever really any doubt?
Spin zeros up into the sky
Our machine is slowly bleeding out

Hallelujah for the country bands
Smother love into this empty house
Blind stranger turned around to me
And said "Tell me what you're seeing now"

Crosses all along the motorway, oh oh oh
And the city returns to the sand, oh oh oh
Baby all the signs are taking me
To no fixed destination

Something strange is coming over me, oh oh oh
Stuck in headlights I don't understand, oh oh oh
Now if only I could start again
With no fixed destination

So I know the road is running out
But I don't think we can turn around
Say the cleanest of all billionaires
Save yourself if you can make it out

And I wish I could have known this place
Before we started living underground
I should be shocked but now I'm mesmerized
In fact it's mentioned what's the difference now?

Crosses all along the motorway, oh oh
And the city returns to the sand, oh oh oh
Baby all the signs are taking me
To no fixed destination

Something strange is coming over me, oh oh oh
Stuck in headlights I don't understand, oh oh oh
Now if only I could start again
With no fixed destination
No fixed destination

As I close my eyes, she's strangely warm
Temple rays of the sun
It's a memory of a place I've never seen
But I'll keep trying while I can
To feel it, feel it

Crosses all along the motorway, oh oh oh
And the city returns to the sand, oh oh oh
Baby all the signs are taking me
To no fixed destination

Something strange is coming over me, oh oh oh
Stuck in headlights I don't understand, oh oh oh
Now if only I could start again
With no fixed destination

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
