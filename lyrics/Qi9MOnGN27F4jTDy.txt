Come to me
Embrace my tears
Let me guide you down into my soul
And let us pray for the world to realize
There is peace, the truth within us

Emptiness erodes your heart
Coz you're free from pain and sorrow
Future is just too bright to show you ways
Wake up now... it's time to lead new souls

Orbit of photon and universe
I am just the part of its plan
目には見えない歪んだ空 人は何処へと歩いていくの？
The last game

Hold my hand
Melt my heart
Feel like I've been caught up in somewhere cold
Like the moon and stars hidden in the dark
Finally I found myself in your eyes

If we were
Meant to be, my love
Why do we keep making mistakes
Nothing can fulfill us in this world
Give me hopes to believe in our fate

Orbit of photon and universe
I will follow you all the way
気付きようのない五感の支配 生きる意味さえ知らされぬまま
The last game

Orbit of photon and universe
I am just the part of its plan
目には見えない歪んだ空 人は何処へと歩いていくの？

Orbit of photon and universe
I will follow you all the way
気付きようのない五感の支配 生きる意味さえ知らされぬまま
