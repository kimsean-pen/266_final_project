Here's a little story that must be told
About two young brothers who was put on hold
They tried to stop the goal
We on a spiritual plane
Tried to kill the pride
And destroy the name
We just two bad brothers
Who will never quit

Kweli (we the ultimate)
Make sure that you tell
Everybody you know
To get on line
Take a ride
To the black star show!
