I have been a mess of late
And you wouldn't be impressed
But I've got something on my chest
I've been stressed of late
But please don't try to guess whats on my mind
You probably won't like what you'll find

Oh you, you wouldn't like me
If you saw what was inside me
Yeah you, you wouldn't like me
At all

And I have been bad before
(I've been bad)
But never quite like that
It was always more of a passing fad
I've been had before
(I've been had)
But I've never gotten back
And it feels so much like being in love
That I thought you should know

You, you wouldn't like me
If you saw what was inside me
Yeah you, you wouldn't like me
At all

No you, you wouldn't like me
No matter how pleasant I'd be
Yeah you, you wouldn't like me
At all

And nobody knows
Just how far down this goes
And nobody knows
Just how far down this goes
And nobody knows
Just how far down this goes
And nobody knows
That if I pause I'll go down below

I have been a mess of late
And you wouldn't be impressed
But i've got something on my chest
I've been stressed of late
(I've been stressed)
But please don't try to guess what's on my mind

Oh you, you wouldn't like me
If you saw what was inside me
Yeah you, you wouldn't like me
At all

No you, you wouldn't like me (You wouldn't like me)
No matter how pleasant I'd be
Yeah you, you wouldn't like me
At all
At all
