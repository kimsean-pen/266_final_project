Time is there so everything
Doesn't happen at once
But in my more recent past
That law didn't aid me very fast

With a thousand sensations
I was burned alive
All during one split second
And chaos arrived

Keep breaking my own rules
For us both to pull through
Breaking my rules

Keep breaking my own rules
I do it for you
For us both to pull through
But I will need time to assemble my heart
For our new start

Crashed into who I am
And discovered that friends
Are simply just enemies
That didn't have the chance
To stab you in the back yet
So this is rock bottom?
No one was down here to break my fall
There's just one way out of here
And that's up

Keep breaking my own rules
I do it for you
For us both to pull through
But I will need time to assemble my heart
For our new start

True love, a chemical illusion, a heartbleed bug...
Merely chance, or could it all be real?
Was it the hand of fate that pushed another chess piece
Moving the Queen and forcing the King into position
Checkmate
I will never truly know
Saturate
My heart with your poison
Your poison

Keep breaking my own rules
For us both to pull through
Breaking my rules

Keep breaking my own rules
I do it for you
For us both to pull through
But I will need time to assemble my heart
For our new start
My heart is still bleeding
It's bleeding over you
I think we can pull through
But I will need time to assemble myself
For our new start
