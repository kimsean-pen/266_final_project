I wish this could be
A happy song
But my happiness disappeared
The moment you were gone
Don't think I ever believed that
This day will come
Now all I'm feeling
Is lost and numb
And Oohh
I know I promised
Mmmmm
That I will try but.

I
Yes I
Miss you
And its killing inside

I'll always be thankful
For the time we had
we were blessed i should celebrate
but I feel too sad
our wonderful memories
just make me fall apart
and it feels like somebody is
stepping in my heart
nooo
i know i promised
mmmm
that i wouldnt cry

But i, yes i
miss you
and its killing inside
And i, yes i
miss you
want you by my side
walking, holding hands
talking making plans
touching my heart, my soul

i wish this could be
a happy song
but my happiness disappeared
The moment you were gone
tell me its not happening
say its not as it seems
tell me that im gonna wake up
its just a bad dream
please tell me that its fiction
tell me its just a lie
what ever you choose to tell me
please say you didnt die

i, yes i
miss you
and its killing inside
oh
i, yes i
miss you.want you by my side
oh
i, oh i
miss you.want you by my side
right here by my side
here by my side
