I'm a child to your voice
To the sound though it can eat me alive
Ten toes and ten fingers
Any sense that I've had in this life

Won't you stay a while
Kill some time
You know that I'll make it easy

And I know
Know it wouldn't be forever
Forever I've known
Nothing stays forever
Couldn't still try

I want to see you
It's not good enough to have you here in my head
Want the spray from the sea
Come on I'll make it easy

And I know
Know it wouldn't be forever
Forever I've known
Nothing stays forever
Couldn't still try

Things I've said in a rage
Can still be unsaid
Took the cold from my bones
Took the cold from my head

And I know
Know nothing stays forever
Forever I've known
Nothing stays forever
Couldn't just lie

I'm a child to your voice
And I know
Know nothing stays forever
Forever I've known
Nothing stays forever
Forever I've known
