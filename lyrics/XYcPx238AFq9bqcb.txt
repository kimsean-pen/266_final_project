Are we tangled in the static?
All the echoes of ourselves
Always standing in the shadows
Waiting for ages

Does the whole world know?
Does the whole world know?
That we synthesize our souls

Does the whole world know?
Let the whole world
Waiting for ages

Waiting for ages

Here we stand in the mirror
It's getting harder to see
The colors start disappearing
That we forgot how to bleed

We cross our bones for miracles
And pray we get better
They say, "We get better"

We fill the holes with chemicals
And say we get better
Who cares if we're never alive

Woah oh oh oh oh
We cross our bones

Woah oh oh oh oh
We cross our bones

Are we drifting into silence?
Mesmerized and overwhelmed
Have we made the heavens useless?
Waiting for angels

ENOUGH!

DON'T LET THE ILLUSION HAVE YOUR HEART!
Does the whole world know?
Does the whole world know?
That we sympathize our souls
Does the whole world know?
Let the whole world
Waiting for angels
We cross our bones for miracles
And pray we get better
They say, "We get better"
We fill the holes with chemicals
And say we get better
Who cares if we're never alive
Woah oh oh oh oh
We cross our bones (We cross our bones)
Woah oh oh oh oh
We cross our bones (We cross our bones)
We cross our bones for miracles
And pray we get better
They say, "We get better"
We fill the holes with chemicals
And say we get better
Who cares if we're never alive
YEAH!
DON'T LET THE ILLUSION HAVE YOUR HEART!
