What will it take?
What will it take?
To rip the heart from your hate

It's easy to be right when everything repeats
It's easier to cut us down and point at our defeat
It's easy to be right when everything repeats
Dig below the surface find your insecurities

Tell me
Maybe you were right, maybe I was wrong
But I've been silent for far too long
Maybe you were right, maybe I should go
But I've been silent for far too long

You always walk away, soon you'll have to face it
Your distance from reality won't bury or erase it
I tried to do the same, living so complacent
But the problems wouldn't go away, so I turned around to face them

Tell me
Maybe you were right, maybe I was wrong
But I've been silent for far too long
Maybe you were right, maybe I should go
But I've been silent for far too long
