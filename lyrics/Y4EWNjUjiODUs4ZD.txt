This town don't feel mine
I'm fast to get away
Far

I dressed you in her clothes
So drive me far away, away, away

It feels good to know you're mine
Now drive me far away, away, away

Far
Away
I don't care where, just far
Away
I don't care where, just far
Away
I don't care where, just far
Away
I don't care

Far
Away
I don't care where, just far
Away
I don't care where, just far
Away
I don't care where, just far
Away
I don't care

Far
Away
I don't care where, just far
Away
I don't care where, just far
Away
I don't care where, just far
Away
I don't care

Far
Away
I don't care where, just far
Away
I don't care where, just far
Away
I don't care where, just far
Away

Said, far
Away
I don't care where, far
Away
I don't care just where, far
Away
