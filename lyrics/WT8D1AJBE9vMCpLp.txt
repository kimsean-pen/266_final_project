we can talk numbers
we can talk signs
we can talk symbols
we can talk lines

our lies
your secrets
our lights break the sky
outside the buildings
we run wire
wire

when i first ride the sunlight
to dry your dark eyes
when i first ride the sunlight
to dry your dark eyes

our lies
your secrets
our lights break the sky
inside the buildings
all the young run wire
wire

we can talk numbers
we can talk signs
we can talk symbols
we can talk wire.
