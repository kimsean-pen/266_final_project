And I'm looking back
We were young then
In the strangest dream of me
And I'm looking back
We were dumb then
In the strangest dream

Euphoria
Don't leave
Euphoria
Don't lie to me

Now it's in the past
And I'm stuck here
In the strangest dream of me
And we can't go back
To a moment
In a stranger's dream

Euphoria
Don't leave
Euphoria
Don't lie to me

You never got high enough

Euphoria
Don't leave
Euphoria
Don't lie to me
