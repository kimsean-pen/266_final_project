You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first
I loved you first
Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth
I have to go
I have to go

Your hair was long
When we first met

Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
He ate a slice of wonderbread
And went right back to bed

And history books forgot about us
And the Bible didn't mention us
And the Bible didn't mention us
Not even once

You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first
I loved you first
Beneath the stars came fallin' on our heads
But they're just old light
They're just old light

Your hair was long
When we first met

Samson came to my bed
Told me that my hair was red
He told me I was beautiful
And came into my bed

Oh, I cut his hair myself one night
A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light
And he told me that I'd done alright
And kissed me till the morning light, the morning light
And he kissed me till the morning light...

Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
He ate a slice of wonderbread
And went right back to bed
Oh, we couldn't bring the columns down
Yeah, we couldn't destroy a single one
And history books forgot about us
And the Bible didn't mention us
Not even once
You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first
