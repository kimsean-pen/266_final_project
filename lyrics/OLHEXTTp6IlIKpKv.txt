In the morning it's the last time
That I saw her face
In that special way to me

Without a warnin'
She pulled every trick to name a few
What was I supposed to be?

I'd like to think she cried for me
But I don't know
Her memories won't let me be

Just can't let go, in the morning
Is when I think about her
Could it be she cried for me?
I don't think so

In the evening, I don't think
It was a peaceful scene
Seemed to me a little rough

She was leavin'
But she forgot to leave a piece of me
I didn't know she was that tough

I don't know why she'd see me
I don't know what else to be
I'd like to think she cried for me

But I don't know
Her memories won't let me be
Just can't let go in the morning

Is when I think about her
Could it be she cried for me?
I don't think so

Is there something that
I could do to make her feel a thing?
I don't know what to expect

Guess, there's one thing
I got left but then I could be wrong
Maybe that's the thing she wrecked

I don't know why she'd see me
I don't know what else to be
Hope she's diggin' being free

But does she cry for me?
I don't know
Her memories won't let me be
I just can't let go

But in the morning
Is when I think about her
Could it be she cried for me?

I don't know I'd like to think
She cried for me
I don't think so
