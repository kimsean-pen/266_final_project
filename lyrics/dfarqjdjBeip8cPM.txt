, Scattered
Diggin' a hole in a Michigan sea
Find me barely alive
Too stupid to stay and too freaked out to drive

Ditch me, Gone to see Ruby
Keep me refer on call
She's pro, I'm not that bad though
Maybe I've gone too far

taking the stairs
Passed out on the subway,
With blood in my hair
I guess I need a ride
I'll check with my boyfriend and see if it's fine

Ditch me, Gone to see Ruby
Keep me refer on call
She's pro, I'm not that bad though
Maybe I've gone too far

Ditch me, Gone to see Ruby
Keep me refer on call
She's pro, I'm not that bad though
Maybe I've gone too
Maybe I've gone too
Maybe I've gone too far
