You know that I don't like to say goodbye
I didn't know that we were out of time
I'm sorry that I couldn't save your life
So I walk, yeah I walk
I go to pick the phone up every day
And imagine conversations we would say
But I'm always hanging up the same way
And I walk, yeah I walk

In the house where the heart don't cry
Dancing in a silver light
And I'm dreaming of you tonight
I miss you all the time
All the stars are calling out your name
Ever since you went away
There's no sleeping you off my mind
I miss you all the time

I miss you all the time

I know that you were only passing through
In a moment you were lighting up the room
There will never be another like you
So I walk, yeah I walk
And I try to keep my eyes up on the road
And remember all the stories that you told
But I'm sorry that you'll never grow old
So I walk, yeah I walk

In the house where the heart don't cry
You're dancing in a silver light
And I'm dreaming of you tonight
I miss you all the time
All the stars are calling out your name
Ever since you went away
There's no sleeping you off my mind
I miss you all the time
Yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh
I miss you all the time
Oh oh oh oh oh

I miss you
I miss you
I miss you all the time

In the house where the heart don't cry
Dancing in the silver light
And I'm dreaming of you tonight
I miss you all the time
All the stars are calling out your name
Ever since you went away
There's no sleeping you off my mind
I miss you all the time
I miss you all the time
Yeah, I miss you all the time
