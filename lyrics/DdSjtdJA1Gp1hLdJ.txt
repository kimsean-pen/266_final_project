Cancel on me again;
Oh, cancel on me again.
And it's not your fault and again;
No it's not your fault you said.
Oh.

All the world has come to see the end.
You will never see this place again.
And all the world has come to see the end.
And you will never see my face again.

No it's not your fault and again;
No it's not your fault you said.
So cancel on me again.
Oh, cancel on me again.
Oh.

All the world has come to see the end.
You will never see this place again.
And all the world has come to see the end.
And you will never see my face again. (x2)

Dreaming of you pushing up to me;
And I know where it's going to lead.
Dreaming of you rushing up to me;
And you know it's where you want to be.
Dreaming of you pushing up to me;
And I know where it's going to lead.
Dreaming of you rushing up to me;
That was the boy I used to be.

Yeah, I'm dreaming of you rushing,
I'm dreaming of you rushing,
I'm dreaming of you rushing up to me
