A precious child
With an innocent mind
Born to suffer in this life or for another
So hopeless and relentless
Falls this remorseless day
The dark remains
Of a violent world

The day you died
My tears ran dry
I feel you
I hear you
Echo in my soul
I failed you
I miss you so
The day you died
Echoes in my soul

This world's on fire
Turned its back on us
A lost horizon
Left behind
So hopeless and relentless
Falls this remorseless day
The dark reality
Of a hostile world

The day you died
My tears ran dry
I feel you
I hear you
Echo in my soul
I failed you
I miss you so
The day you died
Echoes in my soul

The day you died
My tears ran dry
I feel you
I hear you
Echo in my soul
I failed you
I miss you so
The day you died
Echoes in my soul
