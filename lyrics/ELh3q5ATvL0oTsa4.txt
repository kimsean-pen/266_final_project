Ooh I got this feeling
Ooh you got me beaming
I'm walking on Gold Rays
A feeling that I can't shake
You put the smile on my face like the sunshine
I won't cry cry cry
Cause you're mine all mine
You put the smile on my face like the sunshine
I won't cry cry cry
Cause you mi-i-ne
Ooh I got this feeling
I'm barely breathing
You get to me the good way
A feeling that I can't explain
You put the smile on my face like the sunshine
I won't cry cry cry
Cause you're mine all mine
You put the smile on my face like the sunshine
I won't cry cry cry
Cause you're mi-i-ne
You put the smile on my face like the sunshine
I won't cry cry cry
Cause you're mine all mine
You put the smile on my face like the sunshine
I won't cry cry cry
Cause you're mi-i-ne
Oooo
Oooo
A-Wowowo baby
Oooo
Oooo
A-Wowowo baby
You put the smile on my face like the sunshine
I won't cry cry cry
Cause you're mine all mine
You put the smile on my face like the sunshine
I won't cry cry cry
Cause you're mi-i-ne
You put the smile on my face like the sunshine
I won't cry cry cry
Cause you're mine all mine
You put the smile on my face like the sunshine
I won't cry cry cry
Cause you're mi-i-ne
Oooo
Oooo
Oooo
Oooo
