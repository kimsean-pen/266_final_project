You pray for distance
I never change
Buried it behind the brightness built
Like poison in you
My palm against you
Your ever-anxious days
Buried it behind the brightness built
Like poison in you
And it causes you to shake
In the shape of my mistakes
Buried it behind the brightness built
Like poison in you
My palm against your forehead
Your ever-anxious days

I felt afraid and ashamed that I felt anything at all
I felt you panicking, your shattering, your catastrophic fall
And if I felt long gone, already so far gone
Already anxious, you're shaking up, you're breaking down
I failed you all along

My pen encrypts your own pain, stills that poison in you

I'm pleading for forgiveness now, I failed so many times
Come please now with your own pain and your ever-anxious mind

You plea to break your chain on our ever-changing life
To be buried from behind
The darkness hides that brightest light
My hand against you, your ever-anxious mind
Will be buried in behind the poison spills
That pen it brings back image in my mind
Of that nightstand by your bedside
And the sharp edge you would swing to strike
Would break my hand instead
How you clattered all day rhythmic on that fixture on the wall
Where I caught your silver cabbage moth
Your powdered lust still lingers in my palm

I was building landmarks for my heirs in your scars
I was in the wrong to start
I was building landmarks for my heirs in your scars
I was in the wrong

I felt your pain
I felt my hand shake hard
I felt afraid and ashamed that I felt anything at all
I felt you panicking, your shattering, your catastrophic fall
And I felt long gone
I said your name out loud
Already anxious, I broke it all, I'll fix it all
I failed you all along
My hands buried all the bad news
My hands never get it back
My hands buried all the bad news
My hands, never get it back
