Ravenskill Town Square - Daytime.
Narrator: Morning breaks
Beyond the night

And she's a world away
Through crowded streets

This quiet hooded stranger makes her way
Faythe: "Please excuse me
Sir, can you help me?
Where can I find this man?"
Townsperson: "Sorry, can't speak, someone is waiting"

Faythe: "Yes, I understand."
Narrator: As her will starts to fade
And all but disappears
Like a ghost, suddenly a boy is standing there
And all is clear
Faythe: I'm your friend, trust me, don't be scared.
I am looking for your father, and I promise I can help.

Now take my hand, we haven't time to spare.
Narrator: Hopeful and innocent
Sensing no danger
He sees humanity

Behind the stranger's eyes
Her true identity

Will be revealed when she sheds her disguise
EXT. Rebel Training Camp - Day.
Faythe: My intentions are faithful
There's a chance we can still end this game

I'd be forever grateful
To see him once again
Arhys: You dare to stand
before my eyes?!

You're one of them
Why would I trust you?!
Faythe: It's not like that!

I can't go back
Hope fades away with each passing second
(Gabriel enters and Faythe embraces him.)
Faythe: Lost in this moment

Is where I want to stay
This can't be broken
We need to find a way

Gabriel, I would wait a lifetime
Just to see your face
But all we have is one more day
Gabriel: I remember your father was moved by my song
I know when he sees we're united, that he'll understand
We will walk this road together
We will face this hand in hand
With music and love on our side
We can't lose this fight
Tomorrow our dream comes alive
Comes alive
