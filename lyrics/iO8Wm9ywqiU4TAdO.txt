Face to face
Soul to soul

Piece by piece

Beat by beat
Starting to make sense

Inch by inch

Can't talk, you can't sleep
Know who you are
Don't conform any more

Burn the bridge
Stoke the machine
Cut those ties
Come kiss that guillotine

Blow your mind
Break the routine
Leave everything behind
Come taste the gasoline

Burn the bridge
Stoke the machine
Cut those ties
Come kiss that guillotine

Blow your mind
Break the routine
Leave everything behind
Come taste the gasoline

Burn the bridge
Stall the machine
Cut those ties
Come kiss that guillotine

Blow your mind
Break the routine
Leave everything behind
Come taste the gasoline
Come kiss that guillotine
Come taste the gasoline
Come kiss that guillotine
Come taste the...
