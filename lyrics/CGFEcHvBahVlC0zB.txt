City Talks behind my back
oh you'd better stop your talking before I turn
City streets, they are long
When you're sick and tried of walking on your own
I have stones in my pocket
put them down on the road
So I'll find a way to come back to my home
Dunno when I'll return
Oh I'd rather stop talking or coming back
