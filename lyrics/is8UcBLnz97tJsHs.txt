All I want for Christmas is some ice
Watch my body fall and watch my body rise
Flex it baby, keep me up all night
Like flex oh, like flex

Female body builders from Tijuana buy fake flowers
Fresh from artificial markets at the border
To comply with my strict orders
To impress the Chinese premiere who wants to see them flex
While simultaneously writing his regrets on paper

Film it on your camera-phone, Convert it straight to VHS
And post it to my home address by DH Hour, UPS
So I can sleep at night, smoke my cigarettes in peace
Instead of waking up from dreams and
flexing arms and flexing knees (hit it)

I don't wanna flex for the fuck of it
If you want me for a toy don't count on it
All the boys wanna touch ya, touch ya
And flex, oh and flex

All I want for Christmas is some ice
Watch my body fall and watch my body rise
Flex it baby, keep me up all night
Like flex oh, like flex

I made a meal, especially for you
Take a bite, chew it up, spit it out and start anew
Hand the pulp to your hotel personnel then move to Moscow
Cut your hair and wear Chanel
I've got friends up in high places who can help

But

You don't ever wanna live like that
Baby do you wanna
Buy the Oxford guide to suicide, retreat inside your head
Buy a webcam and a single bed, so everyone can see you flex

I don't wanna flex for the fuck of it
If you want me for a toy don't count on it
All the boys wanna touch ya, touch ya and flex, ooh and flex

All I want for Christmas is some ice
Watch my body fall and watch my body rise
Flex it baby, keep me up all night
Like flex oh, like flex

Do I need a witness? Had an apparition and I saw god
Flexing muscles reached right through the sky
And I tried to flex for her, flex so, I flex, I flex

All I want for Christmas is some ice
Watch my body fall and watch my body rise
Flex it baby, keep me up all night
Like flex oh, like flex

I'm the fucking female Jesus Christ
Break my bones, I'll be reborn, I'll come back twice
Flex it baby, keep me up all night
Like flex oh, like flex
