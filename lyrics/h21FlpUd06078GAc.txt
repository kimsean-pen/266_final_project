You can't play innocent
I figured out what soured every final kiss
Please, I have to know just at what point
in this dream of life we would share, I was replaced with him
He was the only one who ever made me second guess to trust my gut
Oh you're just being honest with your heart
Well why won't you be honest with mine while it's trapped on the line

Take me out of your mind
This fallacy of you singing my melody leaves me worthless
Wake me up with a sign
Tell me in your own true words

We always talked of hope
for when I'd be out on the road and you were home
Or you'd reassure that you're the one
That no distance could get in the way of the life we would make
My shadow kept whispering omens in my ear
That we had an expiration date
and from this premonition I had, I could never escape

Take me out of your mind
This fallacy of you singing my melody leaves me worthless
Wake me up with a sign
Tell me in your own true words

I cannot leave you in this bed
Your shallow breaths keep pulling me closer
With each inhale I'm sucked right in
and I can't stop watching while you sleep
Your beauty is only rivaled with the words you speak so

Speak to me
Just speak to me
Why won't you speak?
Just speak!
But when the words come you play dumb like I'll never know!

Take me out of your mind
This fallacy of you singing my melody leaves me worthless
Wake me up with a sign
Tell me in your own true words that I deserve this

Speak to me!
Speak to me!
