I like the way you lean on the wall
The way that your words almost fall
Right of out your mouth

And maybe this is nothing
But I am feeling something
And the store is always closed
When I need it most

You don't know me
Like I know you
Want to know me

& maybe I could get around
To the other end of town
Cause I know that you'll be there
I know that you'll be there

I just can't see this through
Lying face to face with you
Tell me why it won't work
And I'll tell you why it won't work

You don't know me
Like I know you
Want to know me

Don't you believe that the rest is up to me?
You feel it in your heart
You can't stop what you start
I won't believe it's a family recipe
You've been drinking from the well
You've been drinking, I could tell!

Aren't you cold with your pockets full of snow?
You blow just like the wind
Losing trace of your true friends
I won't believe it's a family recipe
Was yr dad an alcoholic?
A little hyperbolic?

I like the way you lean on the wall
The way that your words almost fall
Right out of your mouth
Kiss me on the mouth
