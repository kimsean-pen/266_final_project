We always fall into the holes we dig,
So ignorant to the depth of them,
A place where we can finally get some rest,
Until the rain starts pouring in.
I hear your voice,
It's calling out,
And fading away.
If it's your choice,
Then pull me out,
And push me away.
Push me away.
Push me away.
Push me away.
I dreamt of climbing out to see your face,
To scale the walls that I've put up in me.
'Cause there's no solace in the pit that I've made,
Once the rain starts pouring in.
I hear your voice,
It's calling out,
And fading away.
If it's your choice,
Then pull me out,
And push me away.
I hear your voice,
It's calling out,
And fading away.
If it's you choice,
Then pull me out,
And push me away.
Here comes the water,
Bringing me to the surface.
Here comes the answer,
To the question I never asked
Here comes the water,
Showing me my true purpose,
Here comes the answer,
That will bring me back.
I hear your voice,
It's calling out
And fading away.
If it's your choice,
Then pull me out,
And push me away.
I hear your voice,
It's calling out
And fading away.
If it's your choice,
Then pull me out,
And push me away.
Push me away
Push me away
Push me away
Push me away
Push me away
Push me away
Push me away
