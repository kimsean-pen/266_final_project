Worse or better, I'm leaving
No more laughter, I mean it
You're broken, I promise
I'll miss you, I'm sorry
Worse or better, I'm leaving
If I run away I'll never look back
You can beg, you can cry
You can say you'll try
But I can't take that chance
If I run away, I'll never look back
I can't fool you no, you know me
Pushed me too hard, I'm shaking
You're talking, no walking
You tripped me I'm falling
Worse or better, I'm leaving
