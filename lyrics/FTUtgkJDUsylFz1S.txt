Never been closer to heaven
Never been further away
Never been closer to heaven
Never been further away

Give me hope
Give me all your love
Tell me now
You're coming home tonight
Have some faith
In the love we share
Is it fate?
Does darkness end in light?

Never been closer to heaven
Never been further away
Never been closer to heaven
Never been further away

Where'd you go?
Did you lose your way?
Tell me now
You're coming back to stay
In my hopes
Paradise is real
Horoscopes
Can't forecast how we'll feel

Never been closer to heaven
Never been further away
Never been closer to heaven
Never been further away

Give me hope
Give me hope

Never been closer to heaven
Never been further away
Never been closer to heaven
Never been further away
Give me hope
Give me hope
