Since the spirit left my soul
Love is but an open hole
But the body's come alive
Since the spirit left my side

I've got so much love to give
So many graves to dig
Soft feelings for you that I struggle with
I've got so much love to give
So many lives to live
But blue-eyed love I can't provide you with

Did you see him again?
Did you call out my name by mistake?
I'm not myself
I just don't have the force like before
I won't fall, I won't fight
I won't call, I won't bite
I'm not myself anymore
I won't fight for your love

Since the spirit came onboard
Love has begged to be explored
And the body's come alive
Since the spirit has arrived

I've got so much love to give
So many graves to dig
Soft feelings for you that I struggle with
I've got so much love to give
So many lives to live
Five words I never thought I'd wrestle with

"Did you see her again?
Did you whisper my name?"
My mistake, I'm not myself
I just don't know this force from before
I won't fall, I won't fight
I won't crawl, I won't bite
I'm not myself anymore
I won't fight for your love

I can't will into motion impossible things
I can't promise devotion or make a bell unring

I've got so much love to give
So many graves to dig
Soft feelings for you that I struggle with
I've got so much love to give
So many lives to live
But blue-eyed love I can't provide you with

I can't un-see this vivid truth
I feel so free, I feel so blue
I've done my time, I can't pretend
There is no me, I'm warning you
I can't undo this vivid truth
Too much, too soon, I feel so blue
I've done my time, I can't pretend
There is no me, there is no end
