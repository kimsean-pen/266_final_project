Children born to get high
Turn your heads to the sky
We're burnin' in the heat below

With the thorn in the side
And the ocean too wide
And the avenues so long

We'll be sufferin' here
In the blood in the fear
If your Judas be met
I would kill you if I cann

Solitary nightbird is singin'
Or a thundercrack you're hearing
I'm lookin' for the rain
To fall

Here's a rift-like shadow appearing
And though my eyes are pale
I'm lookin' for the rain
To fall

We'll be sufferin' here
In the blood in the fear
If your Judas be met
I would kill you if I can

Children born to get high
Turn your heads to the sky
We're burnin' in the heat below

With the thorn in the side
And the ocean too wide
And the avenues so long

Here's a rift-like shadow appearing
And though my eyes are pale
I'm lookin' for the rain
To fall

I'm lookin' for the rain
To fall

I'm lookin' for the rain
To fall

On this down to the fear (?)
All the dogs in the street
Are seeking shelter before a storm
I'm Lookin' for the rain
To fall

Lookin' for the rain
To fall
