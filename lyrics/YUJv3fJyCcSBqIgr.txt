Spent a few days returning to society
I thanked the new and the old gods too
For reassuring me
I knew 'em by name
They crumbled under scrutiny

We drank harsh teas and we burned offerings
To stare death in the face
Newly attuned to the secrets
Whom the day and night exchange

Changing my shape
Removing my impurities
They're gone but not entirely
I was gone but not entirely

All that I can consume and to all I'll subdue
All that I can destroy and all I'll remove
All that I can consume and to all I'll subdue
All that I can destroy and all I'll remove
All that I can consume and to all I'll subdue
All that I can destroy and all I'll remove
All that I can consume and to all I'll subdue
All that I can destroy and all I'll remove
