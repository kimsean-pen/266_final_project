my first lover
my first lover

he was tall and breezy with his long hair down
but he gets a little hazy when I think of him now

my first lover
my first lover

he was always talking tryin to bring me down
but i was not waiting for a white wedding gown
from my first lover

i do not remember any goin wrong
just a record playin that old steve miller song

quicksilver girl
quicksilver girl

at a surfer party with the whiskey porin
and the bottle rollin i was on the floor
with my first lover
my first lover

i do not remember any fights or fits
just shakey morning after callin it quits
with my first lover

quicksilver girl
quicksilver girl
quicksilver girl ... and she's free
