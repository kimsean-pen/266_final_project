I heard I lost it
On the grapevine
I must admit
I had a great time
There are words for people like me
But I don't think there's very many

I've gained the world then lost my soul
Maybe it's cause I'm getting old
All the people that I know
Have gained the world then lost their souls

There's no persuasion that I'm into
I've made some sense of what we've been through
We should form a new foundation
If we could find the right location

Is it prey
On display
I'm feeling well

I've gained the world then lost my soul
Maybe it's cause I'm getting old
All the people that I know
Have gained the world then lost their souls
I've gained the world then lost my soul
Maybe it's cause I'm getting old
All the people that I know
Have gained the world then lost their souls

I've gained the world then lost my soul
Maybe it's cause I'm getting old
All the people that I know
Have gained the world then lost their souls
