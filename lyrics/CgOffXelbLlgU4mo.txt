Super Saiyan, yuh
Curry got the hair like a Super Saiyan, yuh, uh
You the man, nah
Pockets lookin' fatter than the Buddha man, yuh, uh
Ricky Tan, uh, I'ma catch flight like I'm Jackie Chan, uh, yuh
Nigga playin', uh
Show these niggas how to fuckin' make a band, uh, uh

Little bitch ride
I don't fuck with anyone that kill my vibe, uh
If she slide then she better be clean like Tide, uh
Laundry, detergent
I'ma get up in that body like a surgeon
Pussy wetter than a damn sea urchin
Denzel be a fuckin' legend like urban
Legendary shit, you on your secondary shit
I'm on my Yes Julz mixed with Katy Perry shit
White on white, while I'm on this beat
Make a masterpiece like Mona Lisa
Shout out to the reaper, I drop ether
Drop mo' crack than eggs on Easter
I don't need a feature, boy you either
Leave it to me, but you leave it to beaver
Killin' these niggas like shots on the evil
I am a god nigga, call me young shiva
Look at the testament, better than ever been
Makin' an estimate for all my paper, run like a Mexican
Serving the rest of it, buying a resident on a new day
In a new house with the same girl
But she got a new blouse
Pussy running to me, but ain't no mouse
Curry be on point like a motherfucking joust yuh, yuh

Lemme turn into a Super Saiyan real quick
Kill shit, kill shit, my navy seal shit

Yuh, Super Saiyan, yuh
Curry got the hair like a Super Saiyan, yuh, uh
You the man, nah
Pockets lookin' fatter than the Buddha man, yuh, uh
Ricky Tan, yuh
I'ma catch flight like I'm Jackie Chan, uh, yuh
Nigga playin', uh
Show these niggas how to fuckin' make a band, uh
Yuh, Super Saiyan yuh
Curry got the hair like a Super Saiyan, yuh, uh
You the man, nah
Pockets lookin' fatter than the Buddha man, yuh, uh
Ricky Tan yuh
I'ma catch flight like I'm Jackie Chan, uh, yuh
Nigga playin', uh
Show these niggas how to fuckin' make a band, uh, uh

Ahhhhh!
