There goes my head up in the clouds
Every time I hear your name out loud
I thought I made all of it up
I hope I'm not freakin' you out

My fingernails are falling off
I was trapped in Hell and I climbed my way out
I thought I made all of it up
But it's real, it's real
It's the realest thing that ever was

I hope I'm not freakin' you out
I didn't really get a lot of sleep last night
I hope you still want me around
I hop I'm not freakin' you out

If you ever wake up
Would you wanna waste some time with me?
'Cause I don't wanna stay up
Trying to shake how much you mean to me

There goes my head up in the clouds
Every time I say your name out loud

I hope I'm not freakin' you out
I didn't really get a lot of sleep last night
I hope you still want me around
I hope you still want me around

I hope I'm not freakin' you out
I hope I'm not freakin' you out
I hope I'm not freakin' you out
I hope I'm not freakin' you out
