Are you ready?
"We're here"
I'm a rose that's been raised by wolfs
My father getting stuck in everything I know
It's so hard when you would beat
For the truth you know
But we don't want the truth
We just want control
Pre: (I'm on my own he we go)
Moment, put it on me
If you want it
Cause I'm sick and tired of all of this
Flown it if you want it and you can own it But I was gonna let it go

I've seen the devil and I've met fear
Met them both on the road,
That left me here
I've met God and I saw life
And he saved mine a million times

I've met trouble and I've met rain

Laugh with joy and cry with pain

But now I see and I believe

That the ghosts that haunt me

Have been outhaunted

I'm a long way from way back from home
Been travelling like a bullet

Everywhere I go
It gets so out of reach

When you're in control

Cause you've either got the money
Or it's got your soul

Pre: (I'm on my own here we go)
Moment, put it on me

If you want it
Cause I'm sick and tired of all of this
Flown it if you want it and you can own it But I was gonna let it go

I've seen the devil and I've met fear

Met them both on the road,

That left me here
I've met God and I saw life

And he saved mine a million times
I've met trouble and I've met rain

Laugh with joy and cry with pain

But now I see and I believe
That the ghosts that haunt me
Have been outhaunted

They never told me that I could be
Free from the hate that's inside of me
They took my place,
took my dignity
They kept me gazed like an enemy
But I know now I can be
free from the pain that's inside of me
You took my place,
gave me air to breathe
Opened the cage and you set me free

I've seen the devil and I've met fear
Met them both on the road,
That left me here
I've met God and I saw life
And he saved mine a million times
I've met trouble and I've met rain
Laugh with joy and cry with pain
But now I see and I believe
That the ghosts that haunt me
Have been outhaunted.
