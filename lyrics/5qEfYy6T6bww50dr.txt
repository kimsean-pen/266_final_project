Étaín will you seize the wind
Hold on

Fuamnach's anger piercing curse
Her rowan striking Étaín's soul

Fuamnach's jealousy burns and glows
Cast a spell on Midir's love

Butterfly purple fly can you seize the storm
Driven to sea
Seven years of misery
Invisible love will live

Butterfly purple fly seize the storms
Fill the air with music
Driven to sea
Seven years of misery
Invisible love lives on

Étaín will you break her curse
Seize the winds

Fuamnach's anger torturing storms
Turned the girl into a worm

Hold me
Hold me

Fly my butterfly precious bird
You fill his soul with magic
Driven to the rocks
Seven years of misery
Invisible love shall live

Fly my butterfly precious bird
You fill his soul with magic
You fill my soul with magic
You fill my soul with magic
