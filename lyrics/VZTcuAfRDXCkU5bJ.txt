I can't sleep
everything i ever knew
It's a lie

without you
I can't breathe
when my heart is broke in two
There's no beat

without you
You're not gone
but you're not here
It's that's the way it seems tonight
If we could try to end these wars

I know that we can make it right
cause baby
I Don't Wanna Fight no more
I forgot what we were fighting for

and this loneliness that's in my heart
won't let me be apart from you
I don't wanna have to try
Girl, to live without you in my life

So, i'm hoping we can start tonight
cause I Don't Wanna Fight
no more
How can I leave

when everything that I adore
and everything I'm living for
Girl, it's in you
I can't dream

sleepless nights have got me bad
The only dream i ever had
is being with you
I know that we can make it right

It's gonna take a little time
Lets not leave ourselves with no way out
lets not cross that line,(that line)
I Don't Wanna Fight no more

I forgot what we were fighting for
and this loneliness that's in my heart
won't let me be apart from you
I don't wanna have to try

Girl, to live without you in my life
So, i'm hoping we can start tonight
cause I Don't Wanna Fight
no more

Remember that i made a vow
that i would never let you go
I meant it then, I mean it now
and i want to tell you so

I Don't Wanna Fight no more, (oh no)
I forgot what we were fighting for
and this loneliness that's in my heart
won't let me be apart from you

I don't wanna have to try
Girl, to live without you in my life
So, i'm hoping we can start tonight
(can we start)

cause I Don't Wanna Fight
no more...
I Don't Wanna Fight no more
I forgot what we were fighting for, (oh yeah)
and this loneliness that's in my heart
(my heart)
won't let me be apart from you
I don't wanna have to try
Girl, to live without you in my life
So, i'm hoping we can start tonight
(I'm hoping)
cause I Don't Wanna Fight
no more...
It's all a lie
Without you
without you...
