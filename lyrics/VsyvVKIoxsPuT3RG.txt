Let's turn back the clock and do this one more time
It's so hard finding a purpose in my emptiness
Cuz I am an icicle
You are the summer heat
A language that I can barely speak

There is a headache in my head
A pulse in my brain
Nothing will ever change
There's nothing at all, there's nothing at all

I prefer this laying on my chest
There's nothing at all, there's nothing at all

Such slim comfort buried in old pictures
This couch is not as long as I remember
A different shape, out of place, a different pace
Such sudden news that my body can't shake
Cuz my stomach won't stomach the taste
Will you hold me like a baby and tell me the things I need to know?
I never want to be alone

There is a headache in my head
A pulse in my brain
Nothing will ever change
There's nothing at all, there's nothing at all

There's nothing at all, there's nothing at all

I prefer this laying on my chest
There's nothing at all, there's nothing at all

I prefer this laying on my chest
There's nothing at all, there's nothing at all
