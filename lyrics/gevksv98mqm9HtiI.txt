I wake you up in the middle of the night
To express my love for you
Stroke your skin and feel you
Naked I can feel all of you at the same moment

I wake you up in the night feeling
This is out last time together
Therefore sensing all the moments
We've been together, being shared at the same time
Every single touch
We ever touch each other
Every single f*ck we had together
Is in a one trust time lapse
With us here at this moment
History of touches
Every single of archives
Come pressed into our seconds
All with us here as I wake you up
