Please don't mind what I'm trying
To say cause I'm, I'm being honest
When I tell you that you
You're part of the reason
I'm so set on the rest of my life
Being a part of you

You tell me what you think about being open
About being honest with yourself
'Cause things will never be the same

So I guess I'll see you, I'll see you around
I'm spinning, while falling down
Now you know why I'm begging you to stay

Don't waste time getting to the point
'Cause I'm, I'm patiently waiting
For your next phone call
Your next excuse for losing sleep again

You tell me what you think about being open
About being honest with yourself
'Cause things will never be the same

So I guess I'll see you, I'll see you around
I'm spinning, while falling down
Now you know why I'm begging you to stay

'Cause I can't stop it now
It's so amazing how
I know I can't, I could never walk away

How can we resolve this now?
We let it go, and wonder how
This can ever be the same
(Can never be the)
Can never be the same

So I guess I'll see you, I'll see you around
I'm spinning, while falling down
Now you know why I'm begging you, I'm begging!

'Cause I can't stop it now
It's so amazing how
I know I can't, I could never walk away

Please don't mind what I'm trying
To say 'cause I'm, I'm being honest
