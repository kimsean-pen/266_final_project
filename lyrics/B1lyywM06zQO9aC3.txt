You can see his eyes glowing bright
You can see his claws shredding light
It's coming faster than you think
A single strike is all that needs
As the warrior commanding
He cannot refuse but to obey
Spreading wide his wings of steel
Flying high and spitting flames

As you hear the trembling sound of

the dragon's roar through the night
As he's coming faster through the air
You'd better run for your life
Run for your life!
...
As the dragon rise from flames

All he know that he's unchained

Through the night he rides

With his fire burn deep inside

The dragon's breath heat the night
The field's heat is rising high
Ashes rise from beneath
What you'll see, can't be unseen
...
As you hear the trembling sound of
the dragon's wings through the night
As it's coming faster through the air
You'd better run for your life
Run for your life!
Fear, in the middle of night
Beware, take care of your life
Tears, in the heat of the fight
Prepare, for the deadly strike
Fear, in the middle of night
Beware, take care of your life
Tears, in the heat of the fight
Prepare, for the deadly strike
...
Beware the mighty dragon
He will take your souls!
...
EPIC SOLO
