Look back to the first time
You caused harm to the ones you love
We're all lying in wait
To redeem ourselves, to redeem our name

My old man
Always said
You ought to be more tactful
Face your attacker

Theres something about the place that we grew up
That makes me feel nothing for where we are now
We grow up, we move out
A brick wall view that reminds me of nothing but you

I dont wanna be lost like this anymore
