Darling, you and I always make a bet
To see who'll crash
When we reach deep
In the depth of our past

We play the game
Every night we strut and stride
Round the room you and I
Every inch of us tight

You went all the way
Called my bluff
Threw sand on my flame
Thought I'm to blame
I can't help myself

Take what you did and what you said
Turn it up on its head
I hear you hurt in your sighs
I need time but I don't really know why

Darling, you and I always make a bet
Strut and stride round the room every night
Every inch of us dies

Take what I do and what I say
Use it on me another day
I can barely even sigh
I need time but I don't really know

Take what you did and what you said
And turn it up on its head
I hear you hurt in your sighs
I need time but I don't really know why

Darling, you and I always make this bet
