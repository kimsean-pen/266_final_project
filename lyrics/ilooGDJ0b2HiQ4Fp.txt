My goodies, my goodies, my goodies
not MY goodies!

I got a sick reputation for handlin broads
All I need is me, a few seconds or more
and in my rap
tell valet to bring my 'Lac
and I ain't comin back
so you can put a car right there.

I'm the truth
and ain't got nothin' to prove
and you can ask anybody
'cus they seen me do it
Barracades, I run right through 'em
I'm used to 'em
throw all the dirt you want it's no use
you still won't have a pinup in a fabulous room
on her back pickin out a basket of fruit.
(i love you boo)
yeah Freaky Petey love you too
(ha ha)
you know how I do.

You may look at me and think that I'm
just a young girl.

But i'm not
just a young girl
baby this is what i'm lookin' for:
sexy, independent, down to spend it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not bein too dramatic, that's the way I gotta have it.

I bet you want the goodies
bet you thought about it
got you all hot and bothered.

Maybe 'cus I talk about it
lookin for the goodies
keep on lookin' 'cus they stay in the jar
Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh.

Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not goin home with you
you won't get no nookie or the cookies
I'm no rookie
And still i'm
sexy, independent
I ain't with it so you already know.

I'm not bein too dramatic that's the way I gotta have it
you think you're slick
tryna hit
but I'm not dumb
I'm not bein too dramatic it's just how I gotta have it.

I bet you want the goodies
bet you thought about it
got you all hot and bothered
maybe 'cus I talk about it
lookin' for the goodies.
Keep on lookin' 'cus they stay in the jar
Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh.

So damn hot but so young
still got milk on ya tongue
slow down lil one
and you ain't got it all
hey shawty
you think you bad but you ain't bad.

I'll show you what bad is
bad is when you're capable of beatin' the baddest
I been workin at it every since I came to this planet
and I ain't quite there yet but i'm gettin' better at it.

Matter of fact
lemme tell it to you one mo gain
all I gotta do is tell a girl who I am (Petey!)
ain't na chick in here that I can't have
bada boom bada bam ba bam!

You're insinuating that I'm hot
but these goodies boy are not
just for any of the many men that's tryna get on top
no you can't call me later
and I don't want your number
I'm not changin stories
just respect the play I'm callin.

I bet you want the goodies
bet you thought about it
got you all hot and bothered
mayb cus I talk about it
lookin for the goodies
keep on lookin' 'cus they stay in the jar.

I bet you want the goodies
