My vacant heart,
How is it that you split in two parts?
I'm checking in to reminisce.
A roller coaster ride in the dark
To places I don't want to go.

Parachutes to break my fall,
Tangled up in deeper thought,
Makes falling faster.
I'm falling faster.

I found you inside of a dream,
Spinning in circles magically.
Took a picture of your eyes
So I could find my empty mind.

Why is it that you always think twice?
I'm seeing things I should have known.
Cause I could use some light in my night,
To lead me back into your glow.

Don't feed my glass cased heart.
Shattered me with eyes.
Don't be that open book that keeps on closing tight.

Parachutes to break my fall,
Tangled up in deeper thought,
Makes falling faster.
I'm falling faster.

I found you inside of a dream,
Spinning in circles magically.
Took a picture of your eyes
So I could die.

I found you inside of a dream,
Spinning in circles magically.
Took a picture of your eyes
So I could die.
