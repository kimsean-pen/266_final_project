Sometimes I feel like I wanna go back
To a time before my mind turned black
I miss the way it was
When instead of just my gooey brains
All that melted was popsicles and the rain just pelted down
Down on me

Make me into more than a goner
Perhaps a little bit stronger
Thicker skin, less needy,
And maybe to not bruise so damn easily, but you can't
And I won't

I want you to help keep me from growing older
Just let me snot on your shoulder
When all that I'm thinking 'bout is her
Her
Give me everything you got
Don't need drugs cause I can already feel my head rot
And it won't stop

It won't stop
It won't stop
It won't stop
It won't stop

Please slow down
Please slow down

Make it all slow down
Make it all slow down

Make it all slow down
