Torch lit halls
Deceit that burns
The dragon's lair
The blackened air
The face is now upturned

Deceiving mask
Your silent sword
The tithe of sin
The lion's den
Blasphemy unto your lord

The Black Castle of Rome
Midnight's shallow home
Monument of lies
Blinding faithful eyes

Cathedral bells your faithful tears
The divine right
The fearless might
Play upon men's fears
Burning the wise in fires of gold
The dogs of doom
The empty tomb
Millions of faltering souls

Our destiny turned
Never to learn
The saving grace
The endless faith
Has condemned us all to burn
