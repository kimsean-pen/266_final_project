Our winter keeps running us down
We wake up with love hanging on
Killers let go, killers let go

Some kids get a handful of rain
Our hope is the desperate die wise
Killers let go, killers let go

Morning falls from a tree and asks for a name
Claim your ghost, know the wine for what it is

The garden grows into our street
We're holding the blossoms up high
Killers let go, killers let go

Claim your ghost, know the wine for what it is
There's light holding onto the ground
Our music is clumsy and free
Killers let go, killers let go

Claim your ghost, know the wine for what it is
There's light holding onto the ground
Our music is clumsy and free
Killers let go, killers let go

Killers let go, our killers let go
Our killers let go, killers let go
Our killers let go, killers let go
