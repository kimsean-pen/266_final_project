Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you, so, baby, please don't go

Baby, your mind done gone
Well, your mind done gone
Well, your mind done gone, left the county farm
You had the shackles on; baby, please don't go

Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog to get you way down here
I'll make you walk alone; baby, please don't go, hey

Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you, so, baby, please don't go

Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog to get you way down here
Make you walk alone; baby, please don't go

Know how I feel right now?
My baby leavin' on that midnight train, and I'm cryin'

Baby, please don't go
Oh, baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you, so, baby, please don't go yeah

Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog to get you way down here
I make you walk alone; baby, please don't go, yeah

All right
