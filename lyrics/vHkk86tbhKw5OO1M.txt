I sway
Tell you it's gone, a shame
Sounds wait till they form in low rumble ways
To send the body in certain ways
All is gonna come to life when
Movement breaks the dance we ...
Let the kid grow
For the joy of play
Stop wasting your time
With the good and old way
And I'll open up to everything
I sway
Tell you it's gone, a shame
Sounds wait till they form in low rumble
[?] move the body in certain ways
All is gonna come to life when
Movement breaks the dance we ...

Stop wasting your time
And I'm open up to everything
I, I, I, I'm on a
I, I, I, I have a brain
And let it maybe
An overtake
Everything
I, I, I, I'm on a
I, I, I, I have a brain
And let it maybe
An overtake
I, I, I, I'm on a
I, I, I, I have a brain
And let it maybe
An overtake
