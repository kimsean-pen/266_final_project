So this is how I die now
Hands to the air
No, they can't stop the sky falling down, down
Guess I thought that I'd feel good somehow
All you know is up is high
And I am feeling like you ain't going down, down

Disappearing through the silence, yeag
Screams fade and blur
Conversated with the smile, though
Life invisible
Guess I thought that I'd feel better now somehow
Any hour now

Icarus
No, I can't escape this fall
Falling in reverse
Falling in reverse

So how you gonna scream my name
And I gave all I got
I've nothing left to give you
I'm so burnt out and lost
Why's it all just feel the same
And I got all I want
I had you where I wanted
I guess I don't know
How to live with a good thing
And not break it into nothing
Self destruction feels so close

So tell me how you want me here now
Keep crying on the phone
Yeah, that's all I seem to hear now
Keep lying through your teeth
Lie to me, lie with me now
(I'm halfway there, but it's like,
"Shit, I haven't really been doing anything for the last year."
And I've been saying I've been
doing a shit ton but like, in terms of...
I don't know.)

So tell me how you really feel now
Ain't been asked that in a while
Yet you still won't get them hear you out
Just keep at it, bro,
these things always seem to fix themselves somehow
Suck it up, some would kill just to stand where you're standing now

So how you gonna scream my name
When I gave all I got
I've nothing left to give you
And I'm so burnt out and lost
'Cause fuck it, it all feels the same
And I got all I want
I thought that I'd feel something
I guess I'll never know
How to live with a good thing
Fuck my life up for nothing, nothing
'Cause you don't care if I'm still bleeding
You just scream until you hear my name

So this is how I die now
Hands to the air
No, they can't stop the sky falling down, down
Guess I thought that I'd feel good somehow

Disappearing through the silence
Screams fade and blur
Conversated with the smile, though
Life invisible
Guess I thought that I'd feel better now somehow
Any hour now
