And I know... I'm indestructible,
And I know... I'm indestructible--tonight!

Break down,
Come on and tell me it's not true,
It's a shake down,
Come on and tell me who are you,
It's so fake now,
Everything I see right through,
I'm ashamed now to say I ever knew you,

See the great Athenians,
Man they're not even from Athens,
And the kid from Avenue "A",
Man he ain't even from Manhattan,
Nothing's what it seems,
So I'll just stand here laughing,
I'm gonna keep on goin' though,
I can't get distracted,

And I know... I'm indestructible,
And I know... I'm indestructible--tonight!

Playback,
Rock and roll come and save me,
It's a safe bet
That you will never ever betray me,
And I'll give back
Everything that you gave me,
And I know that
No one can ever, ever contain me,
And I won't get bogged down like some American consumer,
Nah, I'm dancing now to a whole different drummer,
And I'll keep listening to the great Joe Strummer,
'Cause through music
We can live forever,

And I know... I'm indestructible,
And I know... I'm indestructible--tonight!
