Stuck between the voice,
Stuck between the voice and the echo.
Stuck between the voice,
Stuck between the voice and the echo.
Stuck between the voice,
Stuck between the voice and the echo.
Stuck between the voice,
Stuck between the voice and the echo.
And the echo, and the echo.

It's time to let my mind go,
And I'm willing to fade away with you.
If this is how I'm saved then let it be.
God stopped listening,
'Cause the wolf kept crying.
God stopped listening,
'Cause the wolf kept crying.

Take the air from my lungs,
Put it in hers because
She's the one who deserves to live;
The one that I pray that God forgives.
(Pray that God forgives)
Pray that God
(Pray that God forgives)
Pray that God
(Pray that God forgives)
She's the one who deserves to live,
The one that He forgives.

Can't stop who I've become,
My love will never be sung.
It's the pain before pleasure,
Now speak for the glory of one.
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes.
You deserve better,
Now give it your all.

Take the air from my lungs,
Put in in hers because
She's the one who deserves to live;
The one that I pray that God forgives.
(Pray that God forgives)
Pray that God
(Pray that God forgives)
Pray that God
(Pray that God forgives)
She's the one who deserves to live,
The one that He forgives.

Why can't my words keep us afloat?
Why can't my words keep us afloat?
And if we drown, let me make it for you.
If we drown, let me make it for you.

I never knew love until you.
I never felt love until you.
So why'd I throw it all away?
Why's it coming unglued?
Why is it coming unglued?

Change me for all the times
You hated my crimes.
You hated my crimes.
Watch the world burn in her eyes.
If we are destined to be damned,
If we're destined to be damned.
Stuck between the voice
And the echo.
