She's such a flirt
And I am the lonely heart
Give it a chance
For our love to start but you'll never see
If you don't give me a shot to show you what I got

But it's too late to pretend
You know me better than I know myself
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf
Always someone else
The next guy who will make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love to someone else

I held your hand (aahhh)
It felt like a movie
I made some plans (aahh)
But you were already moving on now
I'm stuck under a rainy cloud but you don't seem to care
But it's alright 'cause

It's too late to pretend
You know me better than I know myself
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf
Yeah
Always someone else the next guy who will make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love to someone else

I'm tired of wasting all my time
My heart is hanging on the line
Is it me, girl, or someone else?
Please take me off the shelf

Too late to pretend
You know me better than I know myself
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

(Everybody!)

Always someone else the next girl
Who will make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love to someone else
Yeah!
Uhhhhh
