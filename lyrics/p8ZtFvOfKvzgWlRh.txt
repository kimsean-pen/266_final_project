So I got my boots on, got the right amount of leather
And I'm doing me up with a black colour liner
And I'm working my strut but I know it don't matter
All we need in this world is some love
There's a thin line between the dark side and the light side baby tonight
It's a struggle gotta rumble tryin' to find it

But if I had you, that would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you, life would be a party it'd be ecstasy
Yeah if I had you
You y-y-y-y you y-y-y-y-y you y-y-y-y-y you
If I had you

From New York to L. A. getting high rock and rolling
Get a room trash it up 'til it's ten in the morning
Girls in stripper heels, boys rolling in Maseratis
What they need in this world is some love
There's a thin line between the wild time and a flatline baby tonight
It's a struggle gotta rumble tryin' to find it

But if I had you, that would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you, life would be a party it'd be ecstasy
Yeah if I had you
You y-y-y-y you y-y-y-y-y you y-y-y-y-y you
If I had

The flashing of the lights
It might feel so good but I got you stuck on my mind, yeah
The flashing and the stage it might get me high right
But it don't mean a thing tonight

That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you, life would be a party it'd be ecstasy
Yeah if I had you
You y-y-y-y you y-y-y-y-y you y-y-y-y-y you
If I had you

That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money fame and fortune never could compete (never could compete with you)
If I had you, life would be a party it'd be ecstasy (it'd be ecstasy with you)
Yeah if I had you
You y-y-y-y you y-y-y-y-y you y-y-y-y-y you
If I had you
