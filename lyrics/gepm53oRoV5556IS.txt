Oooohhhh
Let me down easy
Let me down easy, woooahhh, before you go

Night and day I've been doing the math
To calculate where we wandered off track
But I know, that this love was never easy

But something's faded inside of your heart
Now you're crusading to tear us apart
It's clear now, I know you're gonna leave me
So disappear now, I won't get in your way

Oooohhhh
Let me down easy
Let me down easy, woooahhh, before you go

Oooohhhh
Let me down easy
Let me down easy, woooahhh, before you go

Well how do I begin to convince you to love me
When you're a star in the sky up above me
And I'm too far down below

Your heavy heart is taking its toll
You've lost all the magic inside of your soul
So sell me a lie before you hit the road

Oooohhhh
Let me down easy
Let me down easy, woooahhh, before you go

Oooohhhh
Let me down easy
Let me down easy, woooahhh, before you go

Oh yeah 'cause I know you'd rather run than stay and try
'Cause I know it's that much easier to say goodbye
Yes I know, so if you've made your mind
Take what you want and get out of my life
But can you do this one last thing
And leave me with my pride

Oooohhhh
Let me down easy
Let me down easy, woooahhh, before you go

Oooohhhh
Let me down easy
Let me down easy, woooahhh, before you go

Night and day I've been doing the math
To calculate where we wandered off track
But I know, that this love was never easy

But something's faded inside of your heart
Now you're crusading to tear us apart
It's clear now, I know you're gonna leave me
So disappear now, I won't get in your way
