Kiss me for old time's sake
Kiss me for making you wait
Kiss me for old time's sake
Kiss me for making you wait

Kiss me for screwing everything in sight
Kiss me for never getting it right
Kiss me goodnight

I've got to pick out what's in the pocket
So I can leave those pockets clean
I've got to pick out what's in the pocket
So I can leave that pocket clean

An' I know that I will always want you
But there's not much that I can do
I'm sweet, will always have to do
Rewind and give me a good clue

An' I know just how your mind works
Open your eyes and watch the roadworks
Come on out it can't get much worse
Sit right down quench your big thirst

I'm tied down with stinkin' thinkin'
Stinkin' thinkin' gets you nowhere
I'm weighed down with stinkin' thinkin'
Stinkin' thinkin' comes from somewhere

Is that what you really want, hey?
Would you like to see me living that way?
The living dead don't get a holiday
Open your eyes, see the real world

Come on down, can't get much worse
Come right down quench your big thirst
Lie around drink your night, nurse

I'm tied down

I'm weighed down with stinkin' thinkin'
Stinkin' thinkin' gets you nowhere
I'm tied down with stinkin' thinkin'
Stinkin' thinkin' comes from somewhere

Steady job in a small town
Guaranteed to bring me right down
Guaranteed to take me nowhere
Guaranteed to make me lose my hair

I've got to pick out what's in my pocket
I've got to pick that pocket clean

Kiss me for old times sake
Kiss me for making a big mistake
Kiss me for always being late
Kiss me for making you wait

Kiss me for screwing everything in sight
Kiss me for never getting it right
Kiss me goodnight

Kiss me for old time's sake
Kiss me for making a big mistake

Kiss me for making you wait
Kiss me for screwing everything in sight
Kiss me for not getting it right
Kiss me goodnight
