Things have been getting pretty rough around here
No coffee cups flying 'round the room
Just daggers born from tears
Let's try to crawl out from under our breath
We can never break up, so I love you to death
But man I've become one so comfortably dumb
I believe you could mean it, but you're not having fun
And I'm sorry

I learned to breathe I guess some time ago
But just recently I learned what it means to take it slow
I'm lousy with excuses and you know I love to swear
So goddammit, I swear to whatever's out there
And I love you more now than I ever have, so

Let's pick another day to call it quits and walk away
Let's find some other time to break down
The storm has gone and blown on through
Shake off the devils a dial or two
You might leave me still, but not today
For now, can we just stay
Can we just stay

You would think by now that I'd be fine
Y'know, like really stretching out
But it would all be lies
I'm no longer in control of my own shoes
There they go
Quickly running out of booze
Drinking to kill myself to live without you
Over there, where I'm still scared
Sometimes

Let's pick another day to call it quits and walk away
Let's find some other time to break down
The storm has gone and blown on through
Shake off the devils a dial or two
You might leave me still, but not today
For now, can we just stay
Can we just stay
For now, can we just stay
Can we just stay
For now, can we just stay
