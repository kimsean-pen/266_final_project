Hey, little prick
I can feel your breath on my neck

Hey, not quite ...
Come with me and I will make your day

So you would find
The magic flight

Hey, what's in your mind
You will never stop to wonder why
Hey, I will come
Take your hand
Together we're one

So, you and I
Go through the nigh

Bring your love and save
Nothing is wrong
I'll carry on it forever
Bring your nasty ring
Keep me with you
Hold me
I will stay forever

Hey, sing with me
How sweat it would be
Oh, Mother Night
Feel the Day
Ocean never ...

... you and I

Bring your love and save
Nothing is wrong
I'll carry on it forever
Bring your nasty ring
Keep me with you
Hold me
I will stay forever
