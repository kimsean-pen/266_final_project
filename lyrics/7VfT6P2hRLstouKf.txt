When I come to walk the line
The fire may come, but we'll be just fine
When I go to walk the line
The fire it will come but we'll be just fine

Mouth of the ocean be well spoken
Watch your [[P]]'s & [[Q]]'s
Now that we're older the future is colder
But what is there to do?
I'll walk the line I'll be just fine
I'll be right back on time
The fire is coming but we'll outrun it
We'll never be undone

What came of the things we once believed?
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
Oh, what came of the things we once believed?
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea

And now our parents are long departed
Who can finish the songs they started?
Bodies are broken but its just a token
Of what is surely to come
Unstitch the suture
Please pause the future so I can collect my things
The fire is coming but we'll outrun it
We'll never be undone

What came of the things we once believed?
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
Oh, what came of the things we once believed?
Oh all, lost to the depths of a hungry sea

When I go to walk the line
The fire it comes but I'll be just fine

What came of the things we once believed?
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea

All lost to
All lost to the depths of a hungry sea
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea

All that's left
All that's left
Is the eco of a roaring sea

Long gone
Long gone
To the trace of a memory

Oh, what came of the things I once believed?

All that's left
All that is left
Is the trace of a memory
