My girl so lovely
Here comes your only love
My boy so lovely
Here comes your only love

City life to countryside
This train ride guarantees
Beatific visions of horror & lovely things
Will I be slain or saved
By the kinds of things I see
There's just one kind
Dose marks the line
Poison or remedy

My girl so lovely
Here comes your only love
My boy so lovely
Here comes your only love

Lights & shadows keep us dancing round & round
In this place where angels come to meet the underground
Now things are new
But tomorrow age dissolves the sheen
From beatific visions of horror & lovely things

My girl so lovely
Here comes your only love
My boy so lovely
Here comes your only love

Everyday I begin again
The end is never near
Will I be slain or saved
By the kinds of things I hear
People talk
Few speak the truth
Most tell their fantasies
People's rules & what they do are often different things

City life to countryside
This train ride guarantees
Living proof of human thoughts & fantasies
I'm not separate no
I know my mind
There's just one kind
The road is lined with beatific visions
They all lead back to me

My girl so lovely
Here comes your only love
My boy so lovely
Here comes your only love

Hey! Bring it back
Alright, that sounds good
Hey DJ, can you turn it up? (Sure)
That's better

City center to countryside
This train ride guarantees
Beatific visions of horror & lovely things
No one's to say if I'll be slain or saved
By the kinds of things I see
There's just one kind
Dose marks the line
Poison or remedy
