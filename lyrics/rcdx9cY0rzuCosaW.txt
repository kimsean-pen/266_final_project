Listen now
The wind is dying down
I can no longer hear
Their wailing and their cries

The shooting stopped a while ago
Not sure who has survived
They used to be friends
And now they simply wiped each other out

The others took their place
Got a second chance
To get through the night

Tell me now
What is right, what is wrong
Where's the line between fear
And total callousness

My heart's beating too fast, I'm trying to catch
Echoes of morality
Maybe there's a chance to expiate my sins
Turn around and start again

There's nowhere to escape
But I have the key
I know the road

So I will take you there
Look after you
And save us both
