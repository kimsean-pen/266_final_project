Do you remember when word was bond?
A fleeting promise in the light of the dawn
Barren December under a falling sky
The end of days and a reason to die
Obliteration never looked so divine
Holding your breath for the moment in time

You lived through hell now you're trying to die
The skin is healed but you're bleeding inside
Shots fired just to numb the pain
There's no one left to save

Night blind on the shining path
Ghost walking in the aftermath
Hypnotized 60 cycle hum
The broken cadence of a distant drum
21 to 1 I'm liking the odds
A blood junkie with a lightning rod
A dirty rig and heavenly nod
And still you wind up nowhere
Obliteration never looked so divine
Holding your breath for the moment in time

You lived through hell now you're trying to die
The skin is healed but you're bleeding inside
Shots fired just to numb the pain
There's no one left to save
There's no one left to save
There's no one left to save

You, you chase the dragon but it followed you home
You, you're lost in fever dreams and broken hope

Decimation never looked so divine
Promise yourself for the very last time

You lived through hell now you're trying to die
The skin is healed but you're bleeding inside
Shots fired just to numb the pain
There's no one left to save
There's no one left to save
There's no one left
A fever dream
There's no one left to save
Shots forever end the pain
There's no one left to save
