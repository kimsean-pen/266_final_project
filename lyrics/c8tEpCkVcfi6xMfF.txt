The morning image from the satellites
Is all blue and green
And we've all got wounds to clean
Here's a rag, here's some gasoline

She wakes up fine and rested well
Released at last from in the sleeping cell
Breathing comes with ease

It's a sweet revenge, built on a chemical ride
My medicine man is the best wires to the temples
Place them on let's see how we sound

It's all green to me
What a sweet revenge
It's all green to me

See them lift off one by one, I see a cool spot here
Let's bring her down, level to the ground
A lovely mess that I am blessed to see, of me, of me

She lifts her wings up high
Sensors show a lifetime until we die
And all the dreams' details perfected in the colored sky

The morning image from the satellites
Is all blue and green
And we've all got wounds to clean
Here's a rag, here's some gasoline

It's all green to me
(Lift up your skies and all the other times, you realize)
It's all green to me
(It lifts up your days in a single phase, I felt your hand)
It's all green to me
(Lift up your skies and all the other times, you realize)
It's all green to me
(It lifts up your days in a single phase)
