Understand the nervous if making
Everything around you better
But all those zeroes after this one
There is no one to destroy your sweater

I'll try to hum it to you if I can't sing
My baby wants me back before I even leave
Smothered and covered by my high school dreams
Call mom and daddy cause the nest is empty
So are you
So are you

Did you meet with your advisor?
Do you still draw in the margins?
Bubble letters reading "What For?"
And I wish I had a stand-in

Let's try to make another year for the teens
My mischief braids cut them for me
Smothered and covered by my high school dreams
Call mom and daddy cause the nest is empty
So are you
So are you

Did you meet with your advisor?
Do you still draw in the margins?
Bubble letters reading "What For?"
And I wish I had a stand-in

Let's try to make another year for the teens
My mischief braids cut them for me
Smothered and covered by my high school dreams
Call mom and daddy cause the nest is empty
So are you
So are you
