Always trusted too much, it was all I had
I was blind to the darkness in everyone I know
Woah-oh-oh

Always looked for the good, all the best intent
After years better passed I see all the signs I missed
Woah-oh-oh

And it feels like a prison I'm living in,
Did I earn all the pain and the consequence
I'm too old to acquit, too young to convict
The weight of my pride giving in

I can feel 'em watching me while I'm learning to survive
Staring at my broken will that I'm too tired to hide
So many demons I can't escape,
Burning my bridges to light the way
I can feel 'em watching me but I'll make it out alive
I'm learning to survive

Here I am wide awake, no I'm not dead yet
And I'm not as confused as I was back then

And it feels like a prison I'm living in,
Did I earn all the pain and the consequence
I'm too old to acquit, too young to convict
(I'm too old to acquit, too young to convict)
The weight of my pride giving in
(The weight of my pride giving in)

I can feel 'em watching me while I'm learning to survive
Staring at my broken will that I'm too tired to hide
So many demons I can't escape,
Burning my bridges to light the way
I can feel 'em watching me but I'll make it out alive
I'm learning to survive

I'm letting go of my shame that I've built up for weeks
I'm learning to survive
I'm letting of the blame from my selfish mistakes
I'm learning to survive

With new life, with new life
It was the only way that I am here today
With new life, with new life
It was the only way that I am here today

I can feel 'em watching me while I'm learning to survive
(Learning to survive)
Staring at my broken will that I'm too tired to hide
(Too tired to hide)
So many demons I can't escape,
Burning my bridges to light the way
(So many demons I can't escape,
Burning my bridges to light the way)
I can feel 'em watching me but I'll make it out alive
(I'll make it out alive)
I'm learning to survive
