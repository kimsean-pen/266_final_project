When we walked the streets together
All the faces seemed to smile back,
And now the pavements have nothing to offer
And all the faces seem to need a slap

There's an unfamiliar grip
On an unfamiliar handkerchief
Attending to the tears on cheeks
I wouldn't notice with you
No matter how vicious the grief
Her expression was damp and crooked
Grabs onto my throat and won't let go

Won't let go
Won't let go
Won't let go

Save me from
The secateurs
I'll pretend
I didn't hear
Can't you see
I'm the ghost in the wrong coast
Biting butter and crumbs

There's a handsome maverick you don't talk about to keep me calm
And I can't help it if I create a version
That pulls you back onto his arm
Please don't tell me

You don't have to darling, I can sense
That he painted you a gushing sunset
And slayed angry panthers in your defence.
And he stands separate and ever deadly

Clings onto my throat and won't let go
Won't let go

Won't let go
Won't let go
Save me from

The secateurs
I'll pretend
I didn't hear
Can't you see
I'm a ghost in the wrong coast
Biting butter and crumbs
(...)
Save me from
The secateurs
I'll pretend
I didn't hear
Can't you see
I'm a ghost in the wrong coast
Biting butter and crumbs
