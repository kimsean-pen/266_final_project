Out on the wiley, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You had a temper like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy

How could you leave me
When I needed to possess you?
I hated you. I loved you, too

Bad dreams in the night
They told me I was going to lose the fight
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering, Wuthering Heights

Heathcliff, it's me Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold!
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold!
Let me in-a-your window

Ooh, it gets dark! It gets lonely
On the other side from you
I pine a lot, I find a lot
Falls through without you
I'm coming back, love, Cruel Heathcliff
My one dream, my only master

Too long I roam in the night
I'm coming back to his side to put it right
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering, Wuthering Heights

Heathcliff, it's me Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold!
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold!
Let me in-a-your window

Ooh! Let me have it
Let me grab at your soul
Ooh! Let me have it
Let me grab at your soul
You know, it's me
Oh no, yeah

Heathcliff, it's me Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold!
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold!
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, It's me Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold!

Heathcliff, it's me Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold!
