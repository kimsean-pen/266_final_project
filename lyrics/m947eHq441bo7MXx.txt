This is my first wedding and I hope it is my last
Things would be fantastic if me and the bride didn't have a past
So I stand by the buffet and submerse myself in brie
I'm tactically positioned
Yeah because the bar is near and the champagne's for free

Oooh oooh ooh ooh

This is my first wedding and I hope it passes quick,
If I've got no feelings for her
then why is my stomach feeling so sick?
As they dance to their soppy song I pray it isn't love
Because she's my heartless bitch
that I just can't seem to get enough of

Oooh oooh ooh ooh

She's not that beautiful, she's not that beautiful!
She'll steal your mind first then your car
She's not that beautiful, she's not that beautiful!
Blame it on an evil twist of fate, that she created from the start

Just one more single malt then it's off to bed for me
My head is spinning round and my legs are break-dancing
I only meant to say farewell but I spilt more than my drink
I can't remember exactly what I said
But I remember being chased up the street!

Oooh oooh ooh ooh

She's not that beautiful, she's not that beautiful!
She'll steal your mind first then your car
She's not that beautiful, she's not that beautiful!
Blame it on an evil twist of fate, that she created from the start

She's not that beautiful, she's not that beautiful!
