Ay baby things are getting crazy it's outta control
Now when the people raise the hot blood from head to the toes
I want the music louder now my boys want it loud
Stop betting for nothing let let me get this right

The thing they sing tonight, things that make us fly
Take it, take it baby come and take it
Hands up to the sky shake them left to right
Shake it, shake it, shake it til you make it

Make me say oh no the everything
Has gone cold cold I need my wings
I run the world world and share it all Now the billion dolla, dolla dolla dolla
Dolla dolla dolla
Dolla dolla dolla
Dolla dolla now the billion dolla

There's some nights in this world that I pick
So then listen to the one that I pick
Let me be there to hold you tight
It should be the same way too
Fast money and fast car do I count them first I guess not
Don't wanna rush I'm young enough
But grown enough to think twice

Say what's in your head (yup just spit it out)
All the dreams you had (uh huh I'll make it pop)
Want a little bit of love and a little bit of faith
Don't hesitate to say yes
I'm on my way

Make me say oh no the everything
Has gone cold cold I need my wings
I run the world world and share it all Now the billion dolla, dolla dolla dolla
Dolla dolla dolla
Dolla dolla dolla
Dolla dolla now the billion dolla

Stay on the floor down I know
When my wall has shattered all

Now the billion dolla, dolla dolla dolla
Dolla dolla dolla
Dolla dolla dolla
Dolla dolla now the billion dolla
Dolla dolla dolla
Dolla dolla dolla
Dolla dolla dolla
Dolla dolla now the billion dolla
