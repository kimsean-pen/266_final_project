We used to go out
Get drunk and get sad
Good friends
But this town
And this scene
Has gone bad

We kept waiting
But still nothing changes
It's a shame

Tired
Old youth
Burnt right out

We kept waiting
But still nothing changes
It's a shame

All those past dues
All those bad moods
All those half truths
All those sad tunes
You wrote while you wasted away

Your big break was what you wanted
A little change was what you needed
Your big break was what you wanted
It's a shame
(2x)

We kept waiting
But still nothing changes
It's a shame

Tired
Old youth
Burnt right out

We kept waiting
But still nothing changes
It's a shame
