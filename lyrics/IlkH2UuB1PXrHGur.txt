There you go and baby here am I
Oh well you left me here so I could sit and cry
Well golly gee what have you done to me?
Well, I guess it doesn't matter anymore

Do you remember baby last September
How you held me tight each and every night
Well, oops-a-daisy, how you drove me crazy
But I guess it doesn't matter any more

There's no use in me a cryin'
I've done everything and now I'm sick of trying
I've thrown away my nights
And wasted all my days over you

Well you go your way and I'll go mine
Now and forever 'til the end of time
I'll find somebody new and baby
We'll say we're through and you won't matter any more

There's no use in me a cryin'
I've done everything and now I'm sick of trying
I've thrown away my nights
And wasted all my days over you

Well you go your way and I'll go mine
Now and forever 'til the end of time
I'll find somebody new and baby
We'll say we're through and you won't matter any more
You won't matter any more
