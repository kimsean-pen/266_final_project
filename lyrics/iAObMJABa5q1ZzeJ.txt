Could you be a teenage idol?
Could you be a movie star?
When l turn on my TV will you smile and wave at me?
Telling Oprah who you are

So you want to be a rock star
With blue eyed bunny's in your bed
Well, remember when you're rich that you sold yourself for this
You'll be famous 'cause you're dead

So don't go higher for desire
Put it in your head
Baby, Hollywood is dead
You can find it in yourself

I don't want to take you dancing
When you're dancing with the world
You can flash your caviar and your million dollar car
I don't need that kind of girl

But you could be that next sensation
Or will you set the latest style?
You don't need a catchy song 'cause the kids will sing along
When you shoot it with a smile

So don't go higher for desire
Put it in your head
Baby, Hollywood is dead
You can find it in yourself

So don't fly higher for your fire
Put it in your head
Baby, Hollywood is dead
You can find it in yourself

Keep it in your head
Hollywood is dead

Well, you can do the mighty tango
You can start your little thing
You can swing from vine to vine while the kiddies wait in line
With the money in their hands

But if you get to California
Save a piece of gold for me
If it's the only thing you save then I'll bet you'll never wave
When I watch you on TV

So don't go higher for desire
Put it in your head
Baby, Hollywood is dead
You can find it in yourself

So don't fly higher for your fire
Put it in your head
Baby, Hollywood is dead
You can find it in yourself

Keep on loving what is true
And the world will come to you
You can find it in yourself

Love what is true
And the world will come to you
You can find it in yourself
No, no, no, no, no

Keep it in your head
Hollywood is dead
Come, come, Hollywood is dead, babe, woo hoo
Oh, Hollywood is dead, yeah, yeah

Oh, it's dead, Hollywood is dead, baby, baby, baby
Keep on loving what is true
And the world will come to you
Hollywood is dead

Get it in your head
Hollywood is dead
Hollywood is dead
Hollywood is dead
