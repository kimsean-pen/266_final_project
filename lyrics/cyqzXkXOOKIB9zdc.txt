You think you're better, you're better than me
You blow me off as history
To avoid conversation you're ignoring me

When you've had enough and you need somebody to know
Well, you're looking tough but you need a way to let it go
Come on now, what's a boy s'posed to do
When I can't seem to leave you alone, touching me touching you

I wanna be your brother, wanna be your father too
Never make you run for cover, even if they want us to
I wanna be your sister, wanna be your mother too
I wanna be, wanna be whatever else that touches you

Whatever else that touches you
Whatever else that touches you

For fear of losing, losing your way
Just stop and listen to the things that they say
To avoid confrontation you walk away

Growing up, found the need to compromise
Well, I've had enough 20 years and I realized
Come on now what's a boy s'posed to do
When I can't seem to leave you alone, touching me touching you

I wanna be your brother, wanna be your father too
Never make you run for cover, even if they want us to
I wanna be your sister, wanna be your mother too
I wanna be, wanna be whatever else that touches you

I wanna be your brother, wanna be your father too
Never make you run for cover, even if they want us to
I wanna be your sister, wanna be your mother too
I wanna be, wanna be whatever else that touches you

Whatever else that touches you
Whatever else that touches you
Whatever else that touches you
Whatever else that touches you

When you've had enough and you need somebody to know
Well, you're looking tough but you need a way to let it go
Come on now, what's a boy s'posed to do
When I can't seem to leave you alone, touching me touching you

This isn't a perfect love
One that we're guilty of
What am I supposed to do?
I can't seem to leave you alone, touching me touching you

This isn't a perfect love (I wanna be your brother, wanna be your father too)
One that we're guilty of (Never make you run for cover, even if they want us to)
What am I supposed to do (I wanna be your sister, wanna be your mother too)
Can't seem to leave you alone touching me touching you (I wanna be, wanna be whatever else that touches you)

This isn't a perfect love (I wanna be your brother, wanna be your father too)
One that we're guilty of (Never make you run for cover, even if they want us to)
What am I supposed to do (I wanna be your sister, wanna be your mother too)
Can't seem to leave you alone (I wanna be, wanna be whatever else that touches you)
