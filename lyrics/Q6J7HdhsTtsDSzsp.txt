A Universe to fill
I cant scratch the surface now
A slow pain still,
Whys everyone watching?
It's like I'm real tired of the clones
I'm real tired of the clones

Whatever you say
Whatever you say
Whatever you say

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

Where's the space i fill
Where's the sympathy I KILLED
I need to find a meaning
I'm useless, I'M USELESS
Trapped inside my own web

Whatever you say
Whatever you say
Whatever you say

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

When I'm alone
I stare at nothingness
Painful silence
Painful silence kills

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

(repeat)
Whatever you say
Whatever you, you say

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light
