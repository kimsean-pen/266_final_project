A cardboard head I see
Has found its way to me
It's out, and it's out, and it's out
Making me cry
I sleep, but I will not move
I'm too scared to leave my room
But I won't be defeated, oh no

What if cards don't go my way
Then it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear
You say to me

It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only your other things that you feel
And the things from which you can't escape

Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait in line
Some numbers are better than others, oh no

What if cards don't go my way
Then it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear
You say to me

It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only your other things that you feel
And the things from which you can't explain

And it's making me cry
And it's making me cry
And I'm slipping away, love
I'm slipping away
It's only superstition
Only your imagination
It's only superstition
Only superstition
