Oh Hanukkah, Oh, Hanukkah
Come light the menorah
come to our party
We'll all dance the hora
Gather 'round the table
we'll give you a treat,
dreidels to play with and latkes to eat

And while we are playing
The candles are burning low
One for each night, they shed a sweet light
to remind us of days long ago
One for each night, they shed a sweet light
to remind us of days long ago

Oh Hanukkah, Oh, Hanukkah
Come light the menorah
come to our party
We'll all dance the hora
Gather 'round the table
we'll give you a treat,
dreidels to play with and latkes to eat

And while we are playing
The candles are burning low
One for each night, they shed a sweet light
to remind us of days long ago
One for each night, they shed a sweet light
to remind us of days long ago

Oh Hanukkah, Oh, Hanukkah
Come light the menorah
come to our party
We'll all dance the hora
Gather 'round the table
we'll give you a treat,
dreidels to play with and latkes to eat

And while we are playing
The candles are burning low
One for each night, they shed a sweet light
to remind us of days long ago
One for each night, they shed a sweet light
to remind us of days long ago

One for each night, they shed a sweet light
to remind us of days long ago
