This could be a chance to repent...
I'm left on my knees,
Breathing without a sound.
This could serve as word for the dead
That there's nothing left worth seeking in this town.

Look into your eyes,
They burn so bright.

I can't give enough of what it is you want...
It's such a foolish game...
Running in circles...
Fast, yet tame.

I swear I'm barely sleeping,
Your heart is barely beating.

Now is the time, run for the aisle.
Open your eyes, we won't get out of here.
Pretty in white, now wait for a smile.
We the lonely...

Now is the time, run for the aisle.
Open your eyes, we won't get out of here.
Pretty in white, wait for a smile.
We are so lonely, we've wrapped ourselves in fear.

Now is the time, run for the aisle.
Open your eyes, we won't get out of here.
Pretty in white, now wait for a smile.
We the lonely...
Have gathered here, bearing a child.
Wrapped up in fear, lying without a sound.
This can't be right... Nothing good becomes of these miles.

Lie! Dry! Heave! (You know you'll do it for me)
