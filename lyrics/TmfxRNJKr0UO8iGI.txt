I've said sorry over a thousand times
Is there anything to say to you to help you dry your eyes?
I would make it all better if I could, I'll help you realise
I cry when you cry, I hurt when you hurt
I make mistakes but I can't turn back time

(I'm only human)
Forgive me
(I'm only human)
Love me
(I'm only human)
Save me, save me from myself
(I'm no super woman)
Embrace me
(I'm fragile and broken)
You're just like me (oh)

I'm perfectly human
I might just tell a lie
I'm perfectly human
But I'm an angel in disguise

I'm staring in the mirror and a stranger's looking back
What are you afraid of, girl? The future or the past?
If you wanna see inside of me all you have to do is ask
I cry when you cry, I hurt when you hurt
I've made mistakes but I can't turn back time

I'm only human
Forgive me
(I'm only human)
Love me
(I'm only human)
Save me, save me from myself
(I'm no super woman)
Embrace me
(I'm fragile and broken)
Just like you, oh

I'm perfectly human
I might just tell a lie
I'm perfectly human
But I'm an angel in disguise

Maybe what tears us apart is what brings us back together
And everything that makes us different really brings us closer
Could you hold me (for a little while)?
Could you love me (without a doubt)?
I need you, I need you

(I'm only human)
Forgive me
(I'm only human)
Love me
(I'm only human)
Save me, save me from myself
(I'm no super woman)
Embrace me
(I'm fragile and broken)
You're just like me (oh)

I'm perfectly human
I might just tell a lie
I'm perfectly human
But I'm an angel in disguise

We're only human (perfectly human, oh)
I might just tell a lie
I'm perfectly human (oh, oh)
But I'm an angel in disguise

I'm perfectly human (perfectly human)
I might just tell a lie
Perfectly human
We're all angels in disguise
