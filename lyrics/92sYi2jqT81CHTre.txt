You say that you're a friend of mine
Can you tell me why I'm felling so lonely?
Take your silences aside

I'm the shadow on your wall
Of all the times you thought
That you still owned me
And all the while I watched us fall

And if you ever find the time to say this
I think I have the right to know
Wish that I could find the strength to say this to you

See that you are running blind
With angry eyes but always smiling
Is this you or are you lying

And if you ever find the time to say this
I think I have the right to know
Wish that I could find the strength to say this to you

And if you ever find the time to say this
I think I have the right to know
Wish that I could find the strength to say this to you

If I'm the shadow on your wall
Then I'll forget about you

And if you ever find the time to say this
I think I have the right to know
Wish that I could find the strength to say this to you

And if you ever find the time to say this
I think I have the right to know
Wish that I could find the strength to say this to you?
