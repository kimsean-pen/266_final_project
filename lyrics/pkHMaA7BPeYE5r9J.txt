Holding back to show me that you're strong
Looking back, I see where I went wrong
Given I'm not scared to cry
Hold back those tears, hold back your fears
Hold back
Lucky I went wrong to show you're still
Strong enough to hold me against my will
Given I'm too scared, too shy
Hold back your fears, hold back my tears
Hold back

'Cause alone in the dark, I could tear you apart
You know it's for real, I can't help how I feel
Real enough to taste, real, don't have to fake
Hold back, hold back

'Cause it's true
Yeah, all I really want is
Somebody to stop me
Somebody to hold me back
It gets worse if it's not you
I'll be lying in a pool of someone else's blood
Saying it's not my fault if somebody gets hurt

Looking up and blinking back the tears
Are you facing up to tell me how this is
Guessing I'm not scared to try
Hold back your pause, hope that is lost
Hope that

'Cause alone in the dark, I could tear you apart
You know it's for real, I can't help how I feel
Real enough to taste, real, won't have to fake
Hold back, hold back

'Cause it's true
Yeah, all I really want is
Somebody to stop me
Somebody to hold me back
It gets worse if it's not you
I'll be lying in a pool of someone else's blood
Saying it's not my fault if somebody gets hurt
'Cause it's true
Yeah, all I really want is
Somebody to stop me
Somebody to hold me back
It gets worse and worse if it's not you
I'll be lying in a pool of someone else's blood
Saying it's not my fault if somebody gets hurt

'Cause alone in the dark, I could tear you apart
'Cause alone in the dark
'Cause alone in the dark, I could tear you apart
Apart, 'part, apart
Apart, apart, apart
'Cause, 'cause, 'cause
