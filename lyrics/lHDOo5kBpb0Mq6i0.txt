Maybe I don't act the way I used to
Cause I don't feel the same about you
In fact that's a lie
I want you

And I raced through soundcheck
Just to meet you on your fag break
And you convinced me
To put life aside and want you

If only for the sake of it could chill you out
And drive us through the night to your sisters
You can fall asleep with my jacket as a cover
And wake up just to join me to smoke

I wanted everything at once
Until you blew me out my mind
Now I don't need nothing

Maybe I don't act the way I used to
Cause I don't feel the same that I did
The fact that I lie
Is cause I want you

If only for the sake of it could chill you out
And drive us through the night to your sisters
And you can fall asleep with my jacket as a cover
And wake up just to join me to smoke

I wanted everything at once
Until you blew me out my mind
And now I don't need nothing

I wanted everything at once
Until you blew me out my mind
And now I don't need nothing

We'll be talking about your background
How it never left you much
Cause you grew up in a small town
You'll appreciate it more
When you're done figuring your life out
And everything's fine

We'll be talking about your background
How it never left you much
Cause you grew up in a small town
You'll appreciate it more
When you're done figuring your life out
And everything's fine

And I raced through soundcheck
Just to meet you on your fag break
And you convinced me
To put life aside and want you
I wanted everything at once
Until you blew me out my mind
And I don't need nothing
I wanted everything at once
Until you blew me out my mind
And I don't need nothing
