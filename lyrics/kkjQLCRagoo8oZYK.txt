Siren's call
From the sea
Raging current
Pulls us under
Fighting for air
Scream for release
As colors dance and weave

To the universe we send
A reflection

Adrift in the ocean
Colors take hold
Shadows take shape
Shimmering
Neutral substratum
Vast without end
Our heart's evolution

Dreams of gods
Of us
Of the fall
Dreams of mountains
We feel
To the marrow
To commune
With what we lost
