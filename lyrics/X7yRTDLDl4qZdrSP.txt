I wanna sit you down and talk
I wanna pull back the veils and find out what it is I've done wrong
I wanna tear these curtains down
I want you to meet me somewhere tonight
In this old tourist town

And we'll go
Low rising
Cause we've gotta come up, we've gotta come up
Low rising
Cause there's no further for us to fall
Low rising
Cause I feel we've had enough, and we're
Low rising
All for the love of you

I wanna take you to the rock
I wanna jump right in and see what that big ocean's got
I wanna turn this thing around
I wanna drink with you all night until we both fall down

'Till we go
Low rising
Cause we've gotta come up, we've gotta come up
Low rising
Cause there's no further for us to fall
Low rising
'Till I feel we've had enough, and we're
Low rising
All for the love of you

(Low rising)

Low rising
Cause we've gotta come up, we've gotta come up
Low rising
'Till I feel we've had enough
Low rising
Cause there's no further for us to fall
Low rising
Oh

All for the love of you

(For the love of you
We're low rising, low rising
I wanna sit you down and talk
I wanna sit you down and talk about it all)
