There's a story I know
We all leave and let go
There is nothing to hold us

In a moment of time
When the fruit becomes wine
And the thought becomes the memory

All of your sorrow
Maybe tomorrow
Will fade away in the air

Trying to please me
Making it easy
It won't be there
It won't be there
In your life
In your life

There's a story I know
We all leave and let go
There is nothing to hold us

In a moment of time
When the fruit becomes wine
And the thought becomes the memory

All of your sorrow
Maybe tomorrow
Will fade away in the air

Trying to please me
Making it easy
It won't be there
It won't be there
In your life
In your life

All of your sorrow
Maybe tomorrow
Will fade away in the air

Trying to please me
Making it easy
It won't be there
It won't be there
In your life
In your life
In your life
Oh, In your life
