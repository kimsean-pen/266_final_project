I'm holding you up, keeping you on your feet,
Always in the dark even when you're next to me.

So how does it feel,
To know that I would do anything to break your fall?
How does it feel?
I give everything but I get nothing at all.

You kill me every time we touch,
Baby you use me, I'm just your crutch,
I don't know how long I can hold you up,
You got me running out of love,
Baby you use me, I'm just your crutch,
I don't know how long I can hold you up.

There's only so much of the weight I can take,
Leaning on me till I bend and I break,

So how does it feel,
To know that I would do anything to break your fall?
How does it feel?
I give everything but I get nothing at all.

You kill me every time we touch,
Baby you use me I'm just your crutch,
I don't know how long I can hold you up,
You got me running out of love,
Baby you use me I'm just your crutch,
I don't know how long I can hold you up.

Where you, where you gonna be?
Where you gonna be when I need somebody?

You kill me every time we touch,
Baby you use me I'm just your crutch,
I don't know how long I can hold you up,
You got me running out of love,
Baby you use me I'm just your crutch,
I don't know how long I can hold you up.
