Allow me love I'm a woman of pristine intuition
When I first saw you I knew I'd be loving you
What I didn't forsee, is you'd be all I need
See I thought I'd been in love
But Now what I'm sure of is, I've never felt this way

It's the first time, for me
It's the first time, I feel True love
and what it really means, Yeh
Its the first time its the first time for me

And I tell friends about the love I'm in
and they want me to describe it
I say there are no words but I will try it
It's like beyond the moon and its all I do
And it knocks me off my feet
And there are moments in the day, that i cant breath

It's the first time, for me
It's the first time, I feel
True love And what it really means
Yeh, Its the first time its the first time for me

Forgive me love, forgive me love, I make me mistakes
And I know sometimes it's more than you can take
But give me one more chance bc the circumstance is that i'm just a beginner
It's the first time for me, Yeh
It's the first time that I feel true love
It's the last time, the last time that i'll love this way hey hey
Bc for all time you will be mine, will you be mine for all time
True love and what it really means
