You're special
You're like rocket through me
Ohh, you're special
You're a rocket through me
And I cannot this time

Agarina
You can't say no
Agarina
This time you will go

You're special
You're like a rocket through me
Ohh, you're special
You're a rocket through me
And I cannot this time

There's a taste that you can't shake
But you can't seem to let them go awry
I know you're special
You're a rocket through me
At this surprised
All the time

I know you said to me
And I don't care at the same time
But I'll take you up and down
Address it to you

You're special
You're like rocket through me
Ohh, you're special
You're a rocket to me
And I cannot this time

There's a taste that you can't shake
But you can't seem to let them go awry
I know you're special
You're a rocket through me
At this surprised
All the time

Agarina
You can't say no
Agarina
This time you will go

I know you said to me
And I don't care at the same time
But I'll take you up and down
I just said to you

Honey bee

I know you said to me
I don't care at the same time
And what do you stay to do?
I saw the worst of you
