I'm stuck in this bed you made
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face
All the lies and they cut so deeply

You can't get enough
You take and take and take
And never say no

You got to get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down
No

You'll never get out of sight
You push it back down
Blackout
Blood in your eye

You say that it's not your fault
And said that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breaking
You run to the back you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough
You take and take and take and take and take
Fuck it are you listening
No

You got to get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down
No

You'll never get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down
No

You got to get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down
No

You'll never get out of sight
You push it back down
Blackout
Blood in your eye

Bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-blackout
Blood in your eye
You push it back down
Push it back down-down-down
You-you-you-you-you push it back down
Blood in your eye
Blackout
Blackout
Bla-bla-bla-blackout
Blood in your eye
Blackout
Black-bla-black-blackout
Blood in your
You-you-you-you-you-you-you
Black-blackout
Blackout
Black
Blackout
Blood in your eye

(Blackout)
(Blood in your)
(Blackout)
(Blood in your)
(Blackout)
(Blood in your)
(Blackout)
(Blood in your)
(Blackout)
(Blood in your)
(Blackout)

Floating down as colors fill the light
We look up from the ground in fields of paperwhite
Floating up you pass us in the night
The future gazing out a past to overwrite
So come down far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go

Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
