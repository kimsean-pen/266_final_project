You always keep me coming back for more
So many faces in the world but I want yours
The way you make me feel inside my bones
I can't remember how it feels to be alone
And when you call my phone late at night
Anticipation always burns me up inside

Shimmy my way down underground
Polluting airways in my wake (Inside)
Swaying architecture
Grappling a birthday cake (Inside)
It's analogy backfire
In the cliché storm of backwards prose (Inside)
Shoot the agony beam
Wearing sacrificial clothes

I haven't slept for weeks
Just a couple more
And I'll be yours
I'll be coming home again

And we'll tear apart those sheets
And forget the world
A little while
Get to know your form again

Say the part, say the phrase, say the meaning
I want to hear what you're seeing
Say the part, say the phrase, say the meaning
I want to know what you're feeling

If it's making sense on time
Then why do I hear their whines?
If it moves and breathes it's fine
Don't let it mess with your mind

(If you feel alone)
(Quiet on your own)
(Touch as you please)
(You should feel free)

Paging Dr. Mess your patient's throwing food and ate his robe

You always keep me coming back for more
So many faces in the world but I want yours
The way you make me feel inside my bones
I can't remember how it feels to be alone
And when you call my phone late at night
Anticipation always burns me up inside

Shimmy my way down underground
Polluting airways in my wake (Inside)
Swaying architecture
Grappling a birthday cake (Inside)
It's analogy backfire
In the cliché storm of backwards prose (Inside)
Shoot the agony beam
Wearing sacrificial clothes

Quantum something can do anything (Easier said than done)
An accidental public confession was made (Can't be the only one)
I was in a viper fight, but I'm alright
(That jacket looks good on most people)
Confused cause I'm too dumb to find the light
(Finally exiled)

Overcome by circumstance
I put my life in the Devil's hands
Fell lower than before
Lower than ever before

I know it's hard to forgive me now
But I swear I've taught myself how
To barricade the door
I won't go there anymore

Overcome by circumstance
Separated by consequence
I fell lower than before
Lower than I have before

If I could just get through to you
We could put in the final screws
To barricade the door
And start back where we were

Carcinogenic isotope, we need the A-Team montage
Disregard the message from the ending of the album
