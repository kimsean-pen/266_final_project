What you tell baby
But I know, what I know, what I know, yeah
What I see
When I'm wrong, and I'm wrong, and I'm proud to be
Will you take good advice (lie to me baby)
I don't know why liars lie (and now I'm feeling right at home)

Why do the birds always sing
Happy, lost in misery
I do whatever I please
Never let it catch up to me

I do, I do
Why do the birds always sing
Happy, lost in misery
I do whatever I please
Never let it catch up to me

Well you're so sweet
And I'm just an asshole, look at me
Idiotic feel
Nevermind, nevermind, I'm proud to be
¿Aceptarás un buen consejo? (Lie to me baby)
No se, no se como se miente (you know I'm feelin' right at home)

Why do the birds always sing
Happy, lost in misery
I do whatever I please
Never let it catch up to me

I do, I do
Why do the birds always sing
Happy, lost in misery
I do whatever I please
Never let it catch up to me
Don't lie to me
Baby

Dilo como es
No me mientas
Dilo como es
No me mientas!

Don't lie to me, baby

Why do the birds always sing
Happy, lost in misery
I do whatever I please
Never let it catch up to me
Don't, don't, don't lie to me
