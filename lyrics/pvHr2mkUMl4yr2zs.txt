If you're down there by the gauge
You can almost hear the sound
Of the bumper cars crash
And laughter all around
Like the ferris wheel spinning
Whirry circle in your mind
So you pour the Rollercoaster
To leave them all behind

And you're riding
Right on the track
You go all around
Then you come back
You go upward
Then you go down
You go upward then you go down
You go upward then you go down

Onto the giant dipper
And pay them what is owed
They let you go up to the top
Of gravity pressure road
The mountainous potential
You spend it all at once

When you're riding
Right on the track
You go all around
Then you come back
You go upward
Then you go down
You go upward then you go down
You go upward then you go down

That mile you do over
That mile you do over
That mile you do over
That mile you do over
Again

I can tell you go back
I can tell you go back
