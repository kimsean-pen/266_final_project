Feel the pressure, let it go
Feel the pressure, let it go

You try to buy some time
Can't read the signs or the reasons why
Every single time I could drive in blind
Can't make up my mind
I know I'm gonna find my way out

Crash you're going down without a sound
And I'll pass you up before I explode
Breaking until I'll see it through
You won't keep me down when I crash through you

So here we are right now
This is our time to cross this line
Every single time I could drive in blind
Can't make up my mind
I know I'm gonna find my way out

Crash you're going down without a sound
And I'll pass you up before I explode
Breaking until I'll see it through
You won't keep me down when I crash through you
I'll crash through you, yeah

Hear me out, I'm never backing down
I'm never backing down
Hear me out, I'm never backing down
I know you're going down

Crash you're going down without a sound
And I'll pass you up, I'm not gonna crash
And burn away, I'll rise today
You won't break me down when I crash through you

Crash you're going down without a sound
And I'll pass you up before I explode
Breaking until I'll see it through
You won't keep me down when I crash through you

I'll crash through you
I'll crash through you
I'll crash through you

Feel the pressure, let it go
Feel the pressure, let it go
Feel the pressure, let it go

Hear me out, I'm never backing down
I'm never backing down
