I wish that I could hold my tongue
Cause even when I'm right I'm wrong
I wish that I could pull these scabs
And bleed you out
And there's no one,
no one
like you

My coffees got a bitter taste
I wish that I was in that place
New York City
so far from Santa Barbara
Barbara
And there's no one,
no one

like you

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Ohh
Oh oh
Oh oh

Oh oh
Ohh

The summer days are so long
It's hard to hide in the light
So afraid
of what you'll see
On the other side of the light (the light)

and there's no one,
no one
like you

I guess I used to love this place
(you see all this talk about finding yourself)
Feeling that I know it's fate
(You lost yourself)
why is New York City
(God says)
so far
so far from Santa Barbara
(You could travel to the end of the earth)
Barbara

(But you can always come back home)
And there's no one,
no one
like you

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Ohh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Ohh
