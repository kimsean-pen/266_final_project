10, 000 years or more
In jet black meditation
Sonic Tempress hears no more
And hands me my salvation
Walking thru the piles of life
Ignore all accusation
Now I stand here hands are sore
But thats my motivation

The vision never died
The earthling walked in flight

10, 000 Years or more
In jet black meditation
Now I stand here hands are sore
But thats my reputation
