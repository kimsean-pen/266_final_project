Hours of lust, hours of tears passing by before my eyes
Today, tomorrow, yesterday... one life
Days of joy, day of sadness come and go to pass me by
A month, a year, one hundred years, they fly

Ohh, one day I will be gone to lead another life
Ohh, and this world will stop to turn around with me
'Cause

Time... marches
Time... marches
On without us all, never stops, yes

Time... marches
Time... marches
On and on and on, flies eternally

Times of peace, times of fights, constant movement is our life
Can't stop no more, not until... we die
We long for more... eternity, and maybe there's another life
This one is short, no matter how you try

Ohh, but never give up all the hope to lead a good life
No, don't waste your given time to make things worse

Time... marches
Time... marches
On without us all, never stops, yes

Time... marches
Time... marches
On and on and on, flies eternally

Please, please help me see, the best way to be
Make a change and we, live eternally
No more wasted years, no more wasted tears
Life's too short to cry, long enough to try

Time... marches
Time... marches
On without us all, never stops, yes

Time... marches
Time... marches
On and on and on, flies eternally.
