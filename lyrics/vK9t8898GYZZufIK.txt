Walking by yourself in the cold, cold winter
Wrapped up in your coat like it's a magic blanket (wrapped up)
You say "No matter where I go they all look like strangers".
You see the world only seems the fairytale that it isn't.

Dream on, dream on
there's nothing wrong
(there's nothing wrong)
If you dream on, dream on
Of being a swan
(Of being a swan)
but I know you're thinking...

And now you're looking at the sky talking to your angel
Could he turn this dirty street into a flying carpet?
But then you say: "I am not scared of anything"
(You are not scared of anything)
Such a shy lie silent as the snow that is fallin' down.

Dream on, dream on
there's nothing wrong
If you dream on, dream on
(If you dream on, dream on)
Of being a swan.
But I know you're thinking
"Am I gonna make it through?"
Dream on, dream on
there's nothing wrong
(and you can't run away
you've got to find a way
to make it through this mess)
If you dream on, dream on
(If you dream on, dream on)
Of being a swan (Of being a swan)
('cause you can't run away
you've got to find a way
a way out of this mess)
but I know you're thinking
" Am I gonna make it through?"
('cause you can't run away
you've got to find a way
to make it through this mess)
(Go girl, go)
Girl you run, you don't look back
what did you see?
what did you get?
you're on the run
trying to forget
but in the end
is it so bad?
(Go girl, go
Go girl, go
Go girl, go
Go girl, go girl
Go girl, go
Go girl, go girl
Go girl, go
Go girl, go girl
Go girl, go
Go)
Girl you run, you don't look back
what did you see?
what did you get?
you're on the run
trying to forget
but in the end
is it so bad

being a girl
