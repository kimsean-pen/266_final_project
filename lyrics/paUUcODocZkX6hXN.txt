Leave me alone
I wanna get higher
Me and my iPhone both stay on silent
Leave me alone
I wanna get higher
I got my eyes closed thinking about dying
Asking me if I'm blind cause I be wearing glasses too much
Cup under my tongue from eating pussy too fast
Cause I wear glasses too much
Cup under my tongue from eating pussy too much
Stab proof vest on my chest no tank top
Too many nightmares trying to get stabbed up
But wearing expensive get your hands off
Living in the movie but you never have the sound off
Fucking with the town
[?] ground up
Trying to put spikes in my back like bowser

I got demons
You got demons
She got demons
We got demons
Keep em a secret for a reason
Angels trying to guide me the right way
Demons trying to put a bullet in my brain
I got demons
You got demons
She got demons
We got demons
Keep em a secret for a reason
Angels trying to guide me the right way
Demons trying to put a bullet in my brain

In my brain
Drain the liquor it might numb the pain
Different day, same shit its like this everyday
Sold out shows [?]
Make it rain [?]
Valentinos cost more than your wardrobe
You got fake girls
Keep your mouth closed talking like a side hoe
I ain't got enemies, they all just stuck with the jealousy
Your body language say you scared of me
Don't be acting like you some kind of friend of me
Fuck you and that energy
I can't really hear a thing that they be telling me
I got demons in my head they are try killing me
I don't know if I'm gonna be here in a
couple days, couple years, couple weeks
Do I really wanna leave

I got demons
You got demons
She got demons
We got demons
Keep em a secret for a reason
Angels trying to guide me the right way
Demons trying to put a bullet in my brain
I got demons
You got demons
She got demons
We got demons
Keep em a secret for a reason
Angels trying to guide me the right way
Demons trying to put a bullet in my brain

I got demons
You got demons
She got demons
We got demons
The whole world got demons
Heaven is two steps forward
And hell over your shoulder
Bitch
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
