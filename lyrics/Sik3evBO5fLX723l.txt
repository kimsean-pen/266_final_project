Listen brothers, this has got a lot to do with you.
And my sisters, it also does concern you too.
You waste you time hanging around,
with all those freaks out there in town.
Not knowing, all the time.
Ther laughing at you like a clown.
Laughing at you like a clown.

Can you see now, that time is right now, right now.
No time to waste, my friend,
you've got to act, now act now.
Come around one day you'll see,
people will treat it as their destiny.
Its nothing so strange my friend,
only folks who wanna be just men,
only folks who wanna be just men.

Ooo listen brothers, and my sisters.
Listen brothers, eaw yea, and my sisters.

Listen Brothers,
dont you think im trying to put you down.
And my sisters,
dont want to see you treated like a bum.
get your minds, two can love.
Doing what you know is right.
You must make a stand one day,
for its time you stop but think in flight,
for its time you stop but think in flight.

Can you see now,
that time is right now, right now.
No time to waste, my friend,
you've got to act now, act now.
Come around one day you'll see,
people will treat it as their destiny.
It's nothing to waste my friend,
only folks who wanna be just men,
only folks who wanna be just men.
