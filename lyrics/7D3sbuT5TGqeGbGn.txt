So sweet caress, never long to last!
You entered my soul and gave hope to my life
So sweet caress, never hope to last!
You left me behind all alone and aghast
Captured inside such an austere Elysium

Imperfect feelings, futile grief
Love a device against all solitude
As it all went on, the love became
A field in a dream that once had been real

So sweet caress, never long to last!
Destroy this illusion we need a change of fate!
Your frantic thoughts are only a condemned cry

Imperfect feelings, futile grief
Love a device against all solitude
As it all went on, the love became
A field in a dream that once had been real

Primo somniare videbamur
Deinde veritas se praecipitavit

I secretly longed for something
Which had never existed
First I thought it was a dream
But then it smashed into reality
Beautiful on the outside
Decayed deeply within
I secretly longed for something
Which had never existed

Devoted to a body without a soul
Numquam non tibi diffidam
