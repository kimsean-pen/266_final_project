I heard you on my wireless back in '52
Lying awake intent at tuning in on you
If I was young it didn't stop you coming through

Oh-a oh

They took the credit for your second symphony
Rewritten by machine and new technology
And now I understand the supernova scene

Oh-a oh
I met your children, oh-a oh
What did you tell them?
Video killed the radio star

Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind, we've gone too far
Oh-a-a-a oh, oh-a-a-a oh

And now we meet in an abandoned studio
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago
And you remember the jingles used to go

Oh-a oh
You were the first one, oh-a oh
You were the last one
Video killed the radio star

Video killed the radio star
It's in my mind and in my car
We can't rewind we've gone too far, too far
Oh-a-aho oh, oh-a-aho oh, alright

Video killed the radio star

Video killed the radio star
It's in my mind and in my car
We can't rewind we've gone to far
Pictures came and broke your heart
So put all the blame on VCR

You are a radio star
You are a radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed that radio star
Yes it did
