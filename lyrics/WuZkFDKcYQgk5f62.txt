I have all my things away
In here, with me
I can get them when I need
But not today
What's the use in trying to stay
Inside the seams
Where you stitched your hopes and dreams
Back in the day

There are some who will always let you down
There are people who will chain your feet to the ground
White picket castles were built to fall down

This old sunken vessel is where I sleep
It's not worth a nickel but it pays my keep
Where's your white picket castle but where you seat yourself now?

Walk until my knees get weak
My eyes, they stare
Sunken, tangled in my hair
They comb the street
Spare a piece of something deep
For me to share
If it's something I can wear
It's yours to keep

There are some who will always let you down
There are people who will chain your feet to the ground
White picket castles were built to fall down

This old sunken vessel is where I sleep
It's not worth a nickel but it pays my keep
Where's your white picket castle but where you seat yourself now?
