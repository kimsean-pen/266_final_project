They say I'm living in my own reality
Throwing everything that bites me, even money
I wanna sit back, and set myself free
Set myself free, set myself free

Losing their ego, in all that they see
Engineered acts, no clothes on T.V.
Leaving everything that hits me
Do you see what I see, oh

And it's a bit cold
We live in a sick world
And it's a bit bold
But we burn on our own coals

Set myself free
Set myself free

And it's a bit cold
We live in a sick world
And it's a bit bold
But we burn on our own coals

Leaving everything that hits
Set myself free
Leaving everything that hits
Set myself free

Oh, set myself free
Oh, set myself free
Oh, set myself free
Oh, set myself free

Set myself free
Set myself free
Set myself free
Set myself free

Set myself free
Set myself free
Set myself free
Set myself free

Set myself free
