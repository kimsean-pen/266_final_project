Smash my heart in pieces,
It looks so good on the floor

People think it's fun and games but my life is really lonely
Ain't nobody that can save me, ain't nobody that console me
I'm an emo little boy and I want someone to hold me
Got my money like a blanket and I hold it when I'm lonely
Got my blanket and my bottle, yeah, you know I like to sip
Said her lips taste like morphine, asked me if I want a drip
I'm in bed when I'm lonely
I'm in bed when I'm sick
I'm in bed on a flight and I'm in bed on a trip
You say you love me
I know you're lying
You say you're sorry, well, thanks for tryin'
Got a new life, not invited
Got a date now and I'm excited
Is my meant to be being where I wanna be
So I turn off my phone and then I go to sleep
Spent a month on the road, every night a new bed
When I touch back home, could've sworn I was dead
Only focus was important so it's back to work
Always focus on my money, people think I'm a jerk
Yeah, I really, really want it, I can't waste no time
Everybody gettin' money, but I get mine

Think it's fun and games
And my life is so lonely
Can you please hold me?
