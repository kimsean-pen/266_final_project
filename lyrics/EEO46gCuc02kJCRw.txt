There's a sinister feeling brewing
Bout a women and her non-stop yap
In a couple weeks she'll be stewing
Bait the hook of a tender trap
Spend your money on (countless reasons)
Brick-a-brack that cannot be used
Snivel on the ground (that she walks on)
Give an inch and the women want two

The trouble today with women
The mouth don't stop

There's an older one yakity-yackin
Husband's credit cards let her shop
There's a younger one gums keep flappin'
Will the jawbone never stop
There's an ugly one (she needs screwin'!)
Never in your life (no not me!)
There's a pretty one (always talkin!)
Will the women's mouth never cease

The trouble today with women
Yeeeah

The mouth don't stop
The mouth don't stop
The mouth don't stop
Yeah the mouth don't stop

There's an older one yakity-yackin
Husband's credit cards let her shop
There's a younger one gums keep flappin'
Will the jawbone never stop
There's an ugly one (she needs screwin'!)
Never in your life (no not me!)
There's a pretty one (always talkin!)
Will the women's mouth never cease

The mouth don't stop
The mouth don't stop
The mouth don't stop
Oh the mouth don't stop
