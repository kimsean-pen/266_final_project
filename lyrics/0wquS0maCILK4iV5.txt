It's written in the bags under your eyes
And written on the lines on the back of your hands
You keep it in, folded up and I don't mind

There is a secret we all share
And I do not believe in God, but I believe in disrepair
'Cause I've seen it
'Cause I've seen it
Watched it weave
I've watched it weave through it all

And the boys looked at me like I was crazy
I stared through them like they were God
Cut the rope and let 'em fall together
Yeah the boys turn to me for an answer
'Cause I've seen it
'Cause I've seen it

All that's left is the smoking gun
Sing for me, I know you've got it in your lungs
Breathe in, count to four
Breathe out, count to ten
Kiss the ground, you're upside down again

And the boys looked at me like I was crazy
I stared through them like they were God
Cut the rope and let 'em fall together
Yeah the boys turn to me for an answer
'Cause I've seen it
'Cause I've seen death
I've seen it

It's written in the bags under your eyes
And written on the lines on the back of your hands
You keep it in, folded up and I don't mind at all
