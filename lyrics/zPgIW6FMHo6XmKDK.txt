When your work is over
your day is done
put down your hammer
into my world come
into my world come
Life's not easy
and you're no master, son
when you're ready
into my arms come
into my arms come
Love's not easy
not always fun
words are sleazy
my love is better done
my love is better done
Should you choose
should you choose
to love anyone
anytime (--- ---)
then i save these words for you
You weren't my curse
you weren't my curse
thank you naivety for failing me again
he was my next verse
Should I choose
should I choose
to love anyone
anytime (--- ---)
then i save these words for you
you weren't my curse
you weren't my curse
thank you naivety for failing me again
He was my next verse
I've saved these words for you
