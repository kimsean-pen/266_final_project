Truth is
I prefer your body when it's cold
So lay still
And please don't try to hold
My hand

No one cares that you're alive
No one knows you're about to die
Throat in my hands
Fear in your eye
Tears on the bed
Blood in my mouth

Hours
We kill while we have the time
Fingers
Run every inch that is allowed

No one cares that you're alive
No one knows you're about to die
Throat in my hands
Fear in your eye
Tears on the bed
Blood in my mouth
