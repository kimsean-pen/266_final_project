It's coming down
They say this is the storm of centuries
Come together, help each other please
And take cover, find shelter

The camera's off
No one will see my act of charity
I'll share the awning
But what's in it for me, well?
(Take cover, find shelter)

Hey! Mothers in the rain
Do you think they're keeping score
Or doing it for the fame?
These mothers in the rain
They're just trying to keep their babies warm

Me, who I am when no one's watching me
Isn't always who I want to be (Take cover, find shelter)
And you, the rain is soaking
Through your baby's shoes
So I'll do anything you ask me to
As long as there is proof that I can claim
And attach it to my name

Mothers in the rain
Do you think they're keeping score
Or doing it for the fame?
These mothers in the rain
They're just trying to keep their babies warm

I don't expect the world to congratulate me
But I need something
I don't expect the gods to see every deed
But I need something
I want everyone to see my work and love me
I expect the rules to bend a little
And even in rain I want something to gain
Expecting, I'm expecting

Hey! Mothers in the rain
Do you think they're keeping score
Or doing it for the fame?
These mothers in the rain
They're just trying to keep their babies warm

Take cover, find shelter
