haa haa, haa haa
our love is a weapon of mass destruction
destruction, cut deep into my skin
its the only way that you can get in from now on
from now on, well what don't you know?
four years to the sea and i've seen you choking in my dreams
too little, too late, too late to love
well what don't you know?

our loss is a weapon of mass D-E-S-T-R-U-C-T-I-O-N
its too late for me to forgive and forget
now its revenge
//i don't know this line//
four years to the sea and i've seen you choking in my dreams
too little, too late, too late to love
its you, you, you, you, you, you, you!
well what don't you know?

four years till one day, i've seen the truth in my dreams
its too late to love, too late to love
