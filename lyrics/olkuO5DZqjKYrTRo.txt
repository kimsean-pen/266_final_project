Strike up the band
Give yourself a great big hand
And all together now
Altogether now strike up the band

Bring down the house
Once more with feeling now
I'll try to make it count
It's all for you so take a bow

And everybody gave up
Until we start from the top again
Take it all from the top, the top, the top, the top

There's a hole in my soul
That can only be filled by you again
There's a hole in my soul
That can only be fixed by two

It can never be filled, never be filled, never be filled by anyone else but you
It can never be filled, never be filled, never be filled by anyone else but you

Whip up the crowd
Get them going nice and loud
Well you're the only one I see
You're the only one it's you and me

Strike up the band
Give yourself a great big hand
And all together now
Stay together hold onto my hand

And everybody gave up
Until we start from the top again
Take it all from the top, the top, the top, the top

There's a hole in my soul
That can only be filled by you again
There's a hole in my soul
That can only be fixed by two

It can never be filled, never be filled, never be filled by anyone else but you
It can never be filled, never be filled, never be filled by anyone else but you

You find each person in the world is the same
We're just the same, we're just the same
We're only different by name
We're the same

There's a hole in my soul
That can only be filled by you again
There's a hole in my soul
That can only be fixed by two
There's a hole in my soul
That can only be filled by you again
There's a hole in my soul
That a galaxy could fit through
