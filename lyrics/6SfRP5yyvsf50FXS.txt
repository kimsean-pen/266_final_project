I'm by your side
But you don't own me girl
Strange how you come around
The minute you feel frail

Yet I'm holding on
Oh oh oh

Cause when we sing along
Oh oh oh

I am all the light you'll find
Crawling in your night
I take care of you
But you won't treat me right

Can you feel me now
In your heart?

Will you stay along
Or is it too much for you to bare?

Raindrops falling round your tides of blue
But you don't, want to sing along, do you?
Real love, even makes the sun change hue.

Real love, even makes the sun change hue.
And I hold on, just to sing along with you
And I hold on, just to sing along with you

Won't you sing along with me?
