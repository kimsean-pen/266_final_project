Communication is a lot like the wind
When I speak it's like no understands
And I'm left with empty hands forever, I can't speak
So many things I'll never learn
You can't cross bridges that you burn

Why is life such an issue in your mind?
Why are the answers to my problems hard to find?
So hard to find

Don't forget to buckle when you fall
Beneath the pressure of the seconds
When your life became a screamer
Staring at the sea, things become so small
I want movies of my dreams and pictures on my wall

You say that I'm a dreamer
I say you're a non-believer
Take out the light, start screaming
I'm dreaming, I'm a dreamer
No one believes me and you don't either
Tell me what to do
