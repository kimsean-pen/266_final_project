Gotta
get it
work it
flip it
spend it
make it back. In my mind
in my ways
to getting paid
almost played
not ashamed
the feeling weights
doing things
unexplained

But dont it feel good, don't it Gotta
Get it
Work it
Flip it
Spend it
Make it back.

4am on my way
Somewhere fast
Nowheres safe
I'veve been driving round thinkin of
Thinking too much
Think of
But dont it feel good, don't it?
That you got someone you can call
But dont it feel good, dont it?
Baby i just want it all.
