Into the alley
With my hurrying hands
Over the ocean
With my clouded head
Under the lady
With her swaying sin
I am elated
with my coloring

Here's to the ages
And my place in time
Woe to the lonesome
Holding my place in line
And to the sadists
Coming on so straight
I can't relate it
To anything you can say

And outside a candle light
Yes I know who's inside
I hear what you're saying now
You've painted a picture
And pretty well.
