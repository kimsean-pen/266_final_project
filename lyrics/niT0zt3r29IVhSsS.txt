With a thousand kisses
Every moment is all mine
Come back this time

With a thousand kisses
One at time
You brought me crime

Every minute is mine

With a thousand kisses
---- I'm away
You brought me down

With a thousand kisses
Every second I think of you
Come back, it's fine
Bring some wine
And leave my mind
Forever

With a thousand kisses
We share, I don't care
I wish you down

With a thousand kisses
Every second I think of you
Come back it's fine
Bring some wine
And leave my mind forever
