The way she's mine, late at night
And you gimme them eyes, you know what's on my mind
There's just something about your love
There's just something about your love
You're my summer breeze, I want you every day
But I love when you tease me, baby call my name
There's just something about your love
There's just something about your love
Love me in the morning if you've got time
When she's mine, late at night
And she gives me them eyes, you know what's on my mind
There's just something about your love
Baby there's something about your love
'cause you're my summer breeze, I want you every day
But I love when you tease me, baby call my name
There's just something about your love
There's just something about your love
Love me in the morning if you've got time
My lady it's true, you know I'd love to do it
My lady it's true, you know I'd love to do it
My lady it's true, you know I'd love to do you
You know it's true
Love me in the morning
