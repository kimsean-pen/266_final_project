Imagining curving letters
In a languid psalm
In abstract time
Full levity

Rolling through intangible
Phantom mystery
And the furnace of gentle dreams
A caustic womb
Champagne light
After the sacred deep
Blue majesty of dawn
Naked and cordial and virgin
Blue majesty of dawn
Naked and cordial and virgin

Patience and poise
Twin ribbons bare
And make vivid
A dark shallow vein

Patience and poise
Twin ribbons bare
And make vivid
A dark shallow vein

Disguise and shame
Of all light downward

A gaunt fashion
Pulled tightly over peaking bone
A gaunt fashion
Pulled tightly over peaking bone

A small scene
From in the smoking censer
A heart, a heart, a heart
The pulse of rotten roots
Twining through soil
Feasting on droplets
Rest come again
Come again

Rest crack puzzled
So urgent
Wild
Rest crack puzzled
So urgent
Wild
Violent

Freedom flutters down
The drain again
One eye wide to the braille
Of fireflies

I tunnel brutishly
Pig headed
And full of steam
Into the damp comfort
Of this lonely trench
Of this trench
Of this trench
Of this trench
