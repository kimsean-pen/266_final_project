I know I didn't call
But I'll be alone in a little while
You know sometimes when I don't call
I still get along in a little while

I know sometimes I wander
Sometimes I take too long
But I know where I'm heading
I know I'd be alone

I know I didn't call
But I'll be alone in a little while
You know sometimes when I don't call
I still get along in a little while

Oh, I don't mean to leave you
When I'm up and I'm gone
See, I know where I'm heading
With you where I belong

I know I didn't call
But I'll be alone in a little while
You know sometimes when I don't call
I still get along in a little while

I know I didn't call
But I'll be alone in a little while
You know sometimes when I don't call
I still get along in a little while

I know I didn't call

Sometimes when I don't call

(I know I didn't call)

I'll be alone

Sometimes when I don't call
