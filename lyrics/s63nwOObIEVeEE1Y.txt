In life you gotta find your feet
In life you gotta dare to dream
Don't worry
We still love you
You still feel it even when we're miles apart
You're living under Stars and Stripes

In life you gotta spread your wings
Don't worry bout the little things
Keep fighting
Keep trying
We'll be here waiting on the other side
Underneath the Stars and Stripes

This is your song, go write it
Be who you are, don't hide it
You've come so far
Don't let it slip away

Under stars I'll be where you are
Just call no matter how far
Under stars no end to this road
But on we go
And still we roll

Hold my hand, we'll get there someday
Nothing's set in stone until the end

This place is gonna set you free
My love's the only love you need
Do you feel it like I feel it?
Cause I've travelled half the world tonight
I'll find you under Stars and Stripes

This is your song, so write it
Be who you are, don't hide it
You've come so far
Don't let it slip away

Under stars I'll be where you are
Just call no matter how far
Under stars no end to this road
But on we go
And still we roll

Under stars I'll be where you are
Just call no matter how far
Under stars there's no end to this road
On we go
On we go

Hold my hand, we'll get there someday
Nothing's set in stone until the end

Nothing's set in stone until the end
