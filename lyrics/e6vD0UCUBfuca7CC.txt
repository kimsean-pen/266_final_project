Hundred degrees at midnight for the third day in a row
Nobody sleepin' well and I can feel the tension growin'
LA wth rollin' brownouts, rollin' papers and rollin' sixties
Heat exhaustion increasing caution across the city
Some people hit the mall, they're tryin' to stay cool
Some people call the cops; "there's black children in the pool"
Everybody's lookin' sideways, we're ragin' on the highways
I hate it, I'm tryin' to stay hydrated and faded but my way
Is blocked by road construction like a scene from "Falling Down"
Cops, they tryin' to function but it seems they takin' down us
Brown people at will
People get hot and then killed
As the sun begins to set it's hotter, no-one can chill
Everybody's windows open there's not a moment of silence
Alcohol heatin' frustration that's increasing domestic violence
9-1-1 is overwhelmed, homie, guess you on your own
The hills are still on fire, I recommend you stay at home

We got a heatwave
This burn, it's like a heatwave
Heatwave, burn it's like a heatwave
Heatwave, burn it's like a heatwave
It's like a heatwave

Now, Thes, man check this out
Karma's a bitch
And so is LA
Crime always [?], but my rhyme pays
I'm drinkin' ice tea, might splash a little in it
Down the block they said the little homie did it
I hope he didn't, 'cause it's hot out here
Seen the worse of the heat, yet I have no fear
We blastin' P. E. in front of the enemy
From the days of Tom Bradley, y'all consider me
The owner of [?], known for bad activity
'Cause people they be pissin' me, and I'm off the stage
Pull out the [?], make your leg a peg
Nah, I'm just jokin', chokin' on a smokin' provokin'
Good vibes, good rhymes and such
Put on your visor with the tinted green in it
Yo, it's hot, B
No, it's hot, G
Yo, it's hot, B
And we watch the record spin

Heatwave
Burn, it's like a heatwave
Heatwave, burn it's like a heatwave
It's like a heatwave, burn it's like a heatwave
Heatwave
