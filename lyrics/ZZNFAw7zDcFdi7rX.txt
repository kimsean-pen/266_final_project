Lay your head down just for now
Space fills your mind and you dream awhile
The sun floods your room as you drown
Your lungs full of breathing, your true love, believe

One more time to say
I love you always
And keeping faith
Letting love find a way

Move, let the stars suck you in
Hold tight, the night's air and breathe again
Let go and be burnt by the moon
Your hands full of feeling, your true love, believe

One more time to say
I love you always
And keeping faith
Letting love find a way

One more time to say
I love you always
And keeping faith
Letting love find a way

I love you to death
Could you love me to death?
I love you to death
Could you love me?
Could you love me?

One more time to say
I love you always
And keeping faith
Letting love find a way

One more time to say
I love you always
And keeping faith
Letting love find a way

Letting love find a way
Letting love find a way
Letting love
