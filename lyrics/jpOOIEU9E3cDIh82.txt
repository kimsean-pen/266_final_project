I've been driving for an hour
Just talking to the rain
You say I've been driving you crazy
And it's keeping you away
So just give me one good reason
Tell me why I should stay
'Cause I dont wanna waste another moment
In saying things we never meant to say

And I take it just a little bit
I, hold my breath and count to ten
I, I've been waiting for a chance to let you in

If I just breathe
Let it fill the space between
I'll know everything is alright
Breathe
Every little piece of me
You'll see
Everything is alright
If I just breathe

Well it's all so overrated
In not saying how you feel
So you end up watching chances fade
And wondering what's real

And I give you just a little time
I, wonder if you realize
I've been waiting till I see it in your eyes

If I just breathe
Let it fill the space between
I'll know everything is alright
Breathe
Every little piece of me
You'll see
Everything is alright
If I just breathe
Breathe

So I whisper in the dark
Hoping you hear me
Do you hear me?

If I just breathe
Let it fill the space between
I'll know everything is alright
Breathe
Every little piece of me
You'll see
Everything is alright
Everything is alright if I just breathe... Breathe

I've been driving for an hour
Just talking to the rain
