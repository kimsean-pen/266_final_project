I, I went off to the right
Without saying goodbye, goodbye
Where does it go from here?
Is it down to the lake I fear?
Ay, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ay, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Then I call
Ring, ring, ring, ring
(Ring, ring, ring, ring)
La, la, love plus one
Ring, ring, ring, ring
(Ring, ring, ring, ring)

When I call love, give love some soul
If I may be quite so bold
Where does it go from here?
Is it down to the lake I fear?
Ay, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ay, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Then I call
Ring, ring, ring, ring
(Ring, ring, ring, ring)
La la love plus one
Ring, ring, ring, ring
(Ring, ring, ring, ring)

When I call love

La, la, love plus one
Ring, ring, ring, ring
(And I, and I, and I, and I)
La, la, love plus one
Ring, ring, ring, ring
(And I, and I, and I, and I)

When I call love
Love, love
Love plus one, love plus one
Love plus one, love plus one
