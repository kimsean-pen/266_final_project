You were blind, I know you couldn't see, yeah
But in the end it just feels like
You've cheated, right to my face
You only did what you did
For a reason, yeah
You tried to open up,
But you were scared to lose what we had

Why, why?
Did I tell you things that I didn't believe in
I lied
Tried to protect you, by hiding my feelings
We got tied
Up in this lie I created
To keep you on my side
Keepin' it inside of me isn't workin'

Don't lie to me
Don't you do what I've done to you
Don't lie to me
I promise I know it's bad for you
Don't lie to me
Don't wanna go back
To how we both used to be
Uh-na-na, one thing I know
We won't lie around here no more

I don't know who we think
We're deceiving
Tell me, why does it feel like
We need to hide what we are
We weren't honest and now
We're both bleedin', yeah
Let's leave the lies in the past
So we never do it again

Why, why?
Did I tell you things that I didn't believe in
I lied
Tried to protect you, by hiding my feelings
We got tied
Up in this lie I created to keep you on my side
Keepin' it inside of me as I'm workin'

Don't lie to me
Don't you do what I've done to you
Don't lie to me
I promise I know it's bad for you
Don't lie to me
Don't wanna go back to
How we both used to be
Uh-na-na, one thing I know
We won't lie around here no more

Don't lie to me, don't do
What I have done, uh-oh-oh
Don't lie to me, I'm telling you
It's wrong, uh-oh-oh
Tell the truth, that's all
We gotta do, uh-oh-oh
Uh-na-na, one thing I know
We won't lie around here no more

I know we can, we can be
So much better
Now that we have learned
To forgive each other
You only did it this way to
Save all that we have
It's been hard, but look at us now, us now

Don't lie to me
Don't you do what I've done to you
Don't lie to me
I promise I know it's bad for you
Don't lie to me
I don't wanna go back to
How we both used to be
Uh-na-na, one thing I know
We won't lie around here no more

Don't lie to me
Don't you do what I've done to you
Don't lie to me
I promise I know it's bad for you
Don't lie to me
I don't wanna go back to
How we both used to be
Uh-na-na, one thing I know
We won't lie around here no more
