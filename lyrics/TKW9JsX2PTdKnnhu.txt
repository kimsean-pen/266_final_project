I've been told that I'm not good enough a million times.
I've been trying to kid myself with a million lies.
I've been saying I'm so strong when I'm dying inside.
I was engineered that way
I've been left behind.

Well you are,
You are
More than you will ever know.
You are,
You are.

Don't tell me that you're gonna run away from it now.
You're gonna stand here and fight for it.
Don't tell me that you can't
and you're gonna back down.
You're gonna stand here and fight for it.
And i know it's been cold in your soul
And you know I've been there too.
Don't tell me that you're gonna run away from it now.
I'm gonna stand here and fight with you.

I start to unravel 'cause I'm battling the darkest storm.
But I'm still here
And it's clear
I've got to win this war.

My tongues been tied
And my hands been forced
Everything seems much better when I'm holding yours.

You are,
You are
More than you will ever know.
You are,
You are.

Don't tell me that you're gonna run away from it now.
You're gonna stand here and fight for it.
Don't tell me that you can't
and you're gonna back down.
You're gonna stand here and fight for it.
And i know it's been cold in your soul
And you know I've been there too.
Don't tell me that you're gonna run away from it now.
I'm gonna stand here and fight with you.

Someone said reach the stars
but I reach for the clouds
So if I fall at least I know I'm back on the ground.
I float back up and then I swim back down.
Cause I wont sink
No I wont drown.

Don't tell me that you're gonna run away from it now.
You're gonna stand here and fight for it.
Don't tell me that you can't
and you're gonna back down.

Don't tell me that you're gonna run away from it now.
You're gonna stand here and fight for it.
Don't tell me that you can't
and you're gonna back down.
You're gonna stand here and fight for it.
And i know it's been cold in your soul
And you know I've been there too.

Don't tell me that you're gonna run away from it now.
I'm gonna stand here and fight with you.
