From the shadows you hear me howl,
You never believed, you never believed.
From the feeding you are my all,
Finally be gone, finally be gone.

Pick up the pieces,
Pick up the pieces that you never thought that you were true.

Fight through the night,
Shaking withdrawal,
Blinded I fall.

Fight through the long night,
Shaking withdrawal,
Blinded I fall.

The days just drain away,
But setting sun belongs to me.
