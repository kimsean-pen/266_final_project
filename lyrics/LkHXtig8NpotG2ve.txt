What is mine when you leave (empty bed, empty bed)
All the memories I can retrieve (from my head, from my head)
I can't live without your warmth I just wanna be adored
Oh, I'd do anything to bring you home tonight
Oh don't you tell me I am your baby
Over the phone
It don't feel right
Come home and kiss me
Tell me you miss me
Tell me it right
Tell me it right
Another year has passed us by (I'm all alone, all alone)
Crazy how the time does fly (when you're on your own, on your own)
But now it's not only you I am always leaving too
Oh, I'd do anything to bring you here tonight
Oh don't you tell me I am your baby
Over the phone
It don't feel right
Come home and kiss me
Tell me you miss me Tell me it right
Tell me it right
Don't bother asking how my day was
Every day drags the same just because
Without you, I can't get out of my bed
I'd rather visit you in my head
