With your eyes closed watching a strange show play out in your head
But you were smiling somehow
And your day froze and everyone in it sat still as a rose
But we were moving somehow

Back to when we started, losing who we were
Maybe we should only tip a bottle back to keep us filled up
Back to when we started, losing who we were
Everybody knows that you'd break your neck to keep your chin up

Open your eyes
And the drops come in a snail race down to your neck
And look up but you were smiling somehow

Back to when we started losing who we were
Maybe we should only tip a bottle back to keep us filled up
Back to when we started losing who we were
Everybody knows that you'd break your neck to keep your chin up

You'd break your neck to keep your chin up
You'd break your neck to keep your chin up

Back to when we started losing who we were
(You'd break your neck to keep your chin up)
Everybody knows that you'd break your neck to keep your chin up

You'd break your neck to keep your chin up
You'd break your neck to keep your chin up
You'd break your neck to keep your chin up

Back to when we started losing who we were
Maybe we should only tip a bottle back to keep us filled up
Back to when we started losing who we were
(You'd break your neck to keep your chin up)
Everybody knows that you'd break your neck to keep your chin up
