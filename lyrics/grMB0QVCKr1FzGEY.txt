I'm alive again
the darkness far behind me
i'm invincible
despair will never find me
I feel strong
i've got a new sense of elation
boundless energy
euphoria fixation
Still it's hard to just get by
it seems so meaningless to try
when all i want to do is cry
who would ever know i felt so sad
Even though i get so high
i know that i will never fly
and when i fall out of the sky
who'll be standing by
Will you be standing by
