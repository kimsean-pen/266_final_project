We were drowning, drowning in sin
You were higher than you'd ever been
And I can see it through your own skeleton
You can't pretend

All the white lines are crossing your eyes
You wanna fight, but nobody wins
Nobody wins, nobody wins

I'm lying on the ground, but I got you now
Your time is running out, I don't need you now
Let's go another round, I got you now
I got you now, so try to shoot me down
Shoot me down, shoot me down
Shoot me down, shoot me down

In the silence, it's so defining
For my body dancing within
When it's violent
My heart wants to sing, but you choke me again

All the white lines are crossing your eyes
You wanna fight, but nobody wins
Nobody wins, nobody wins

I'm lying on the ground, but I got you now
Your time is running out, I don't need you now
Let's go another round, I got you now
I got you now, so try to shoot me down
Shoot me down, shoot me down
Shoot me down, shoot me down
Shoot me down, shoot me down

(I give in, I give in, I give in, I give in...)
When the lights go out, you're in my head
But it's over now, it's over now
(I give in, I give in, I give in, I give in...)

I'm lying on the ground, but I got you now
Your time is running out, I don't need you now
Let's go another round, I got you now
I got you now, so try to shoot me down
Shoot me down, shoot me down
Shoot me down, shoot me down, shoot me down

(I'm lying on the ground)
Shoot me down
(So try to shoot me down)
Shoot me down
(I'm lying on the ground)
Shoot me down
So shoot me down, shoot me down
