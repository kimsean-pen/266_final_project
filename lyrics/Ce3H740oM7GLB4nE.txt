Bend me, shape me, misdirect me
It's all the same to me
Look at all this useless talk
Look at all this useless talk
Look at all this useless talk
The party crawls

You look at me, but you don't see
Understand I'm a sinner
Don't corner me
Don't lecture me, raise your hands, you're a sinner!

Is this everything you wanted?
Find another dream
You never hear a word I say
You never hear a word I say
You never hear a word I say, so pray!

You look at me, but you don't see
Understand I'm a sinner
Don't corner me
Don't lecture me, raise your hands, you're a sinner!

I'm a sinner...
Look at all these people in front of me
Look at all these people in front of me
Look at all these people in front of me
Look at all these people in front of me now!

You look at me, but you don't see
Understand I'm a sinner
Don't corner me
Don't lecture me, raise your hands, you're a sinner!

You look at me (you look at me)
Don't corner me
You look at me (you look at me)
Raise your hands, you're a sinner
