Standing humble, a fist of rage
A silent army, they call my name
Seated firmly, and not in dismayed
I'm never broken, and I'm not afraid

So come with me, let's take this world and make a change
we'll give this, more than we can take away
And we'll see this, through eyes we always thought were blind
If we could find, just one light to shine
Just one light to shine

Walls will crumble at our feet
All we know we will finally see
We'll fight for hope, and we'll kill this doubt
Angels of war, let me out

Come with me, let's take this word and make a change
And we'll give this, more than we can take away
And we'll see this, through eyes we always thought were blind
If we could find, just one light to shine
Just one light to shine

So come with me, let's take this word and make a change
And we'll give this, more than they can take away
And we'll see this, through eyes we always thought were blind
If we could find, just one light to shine
Just one light to shine
