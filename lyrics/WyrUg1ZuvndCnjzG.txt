Come, take a look inside
What you've lost you'll find
What you want is right in front of you
Look, underneath the stairs
What's broken is repaired
Now there's nothing left behind,
nothing left of you
Voices start to change
Faces rearrange
Eyes roll back and hands are pulling you down
They're dragging you beneath, ... between your teeth
You'll sleep when the shadow moves over your
black eyes
I hear you calling out for me tonight
No rest for the soon departed

Black eyes
I hear you calling out for me tonight
No rest for the soon departed

Eyes hiding in the hall, hanging on the wall
Through this broken window feeling the cold distance of the moon
In this empty room,
now there's nothing left behind and it's all because of you

Cover your ears, you don't want to hear
The whispers in the wall are making it clear
You're all by yourself, there is no one else
You'll sleep when the shadow moves over your

black eyes
I hear you calling out for me tonight
No rest for the soon departed

Black eyes
You won't be dreaming when you sleep tonight
I'll finish what you started

Hands cover your eyes
Now that you realize
All the things you loved were never here
What's lost will be found,
buried underground
You'll sleep when the shadow moves over your

Black eyes
I hear you calling out for me tonight
No rest for the soon departed
Black eyes
You won't be dreaming when you sleep tonight
I'll finish what you started
