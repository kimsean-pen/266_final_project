Is it bad if I care for you?
You make it seem like it is a crime that I love you
Is it bad if I care for you?
You make it seem like it is a crime that I love you

I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
You did it to me like you've played this game before
You did it to me like you've played this game before

It seems so official
Boy I waited, waited, dodging players just to get you
They been saying things, just instigators, while I kept you
This shit seem automatic, I have, I ain't into

You don't really want me now
You know there's always someone else

You did it to me like you've played this game
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
You did it to me like you've played this game before
You did it to me like you've played this game before

Yah
Throw hands in the air
Swear I can't bring that ass anywhere
You don't wanna fling, bring that ass over here
Boy, feeling like a contest, how you wanna stare?
Your attention span prolly long as your hair too
If you're true why you gotta dare boo
Some win and some gotta lose
You really need love, two L's, no cool
It is not me, nor them, just you
Act like a fee, but the part don't suit
Act seventeen when you're thirty-two
Pussy too clean, and it purrty too
So I can't intervene on your escapades
Cause I ain't really tryna be the next to pay
And be the next to say, "I got an ex today"
I can see it in your eyes when you flex your games and shit

I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
