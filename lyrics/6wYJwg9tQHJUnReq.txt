I'm from a land called secret Estonia
Nobody knows where it's at
Nobody knows where it's at
Nobody knows where it's at
Ice cream mountains and chocolate skies
Nobody knows where it's at
Nobody knows where it's at
Nobody knows where it's at

Põdral maja metsa sees
Väiksest aknast välja vaatab
Jänes jookseb kõigest väest
Lävel seisma jääb
Kopp-kopp lahti tee
Metsas kuri jahimees
Jänes tuppa tule sa
Anna käppa ka

(Translation)
A reindeer has a little house in the forest
He's looking out from a small window
The rabbit is running towards the house
And he stops in the doorway
Knock-knock, open up
There's an evil hunter in the forest
The reindeer says to the rabbit
Come inside and shake my hand
