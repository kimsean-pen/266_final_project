You might think the grass is greener, here I am on the other side
Laying back on a round-a-bout, building castles in the sky
Ten years later I will remember, throw away songs we learn today
A twenty, twenty visionary, will never waste a single day
Never waste a single day, come on!
Back again, fist full of pennies, all I get is join the Que
Got called back while you were out, I'm not bothered but so are you

It's plain to see, it's already down for me
Wanna make a feast of it all, scratch my name on the wall
I'm feeling fine, this is my time to shine
It's nearly but it's not too late, the future's getting underway
I'm just saying, I'm just saying

I'm just saying, (1, 2, 3) I'm just saying, (you and me) I'm just saying
(7, 8, 9) I'm just saying, (no wasting time) I'm just saying
