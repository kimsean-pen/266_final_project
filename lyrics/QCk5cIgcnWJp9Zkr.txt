He got me feeling so fine
He taught the sun how to shine
He turns my water to wine
He do it every time
Ain't nothing better than that
I let him play with my cat
Got nothing on but his hat
Ain't nothing wrong with that

All that I want him to know
That I want him to know
Is that I love him so
He's better than I ever had
More than I can stand

I found me a better man, better man
Who loves me better than, better than
Better than you ever can
Don't want no animal
Acting so out of control
I found me a better man
He grease my pan
Better than you can

He's no complicated man
He's happy holding my hand
He likes to swim in my tub
I like his rub'a'dub
He's never stolen my car
Or tried to pawn my guitar
He doesn't flirt with my friends
My money he don't spend

All that I want him to know
That I want him to know
Is that I love him so
Better than I ever had
More than I can stand

I found me a better man, better man
Who loves me better than, better than
Better than you ever can
Don't want no animal
Acting so out of control
I found me a better man
He grease my pan
Better than you can

Love and happiness I have received
Love has surely been so good to me
I finally found myself a piece of sky

I found me a better man
Who loves me better than
Better than you ever can

I found me a better man, better man
Who loves me better than, better than
Better than you ever can
Don't want no animal
Acting so out of control
I found me a better man

I found me a better man
Who loves me better than
Better than you ever can
He grease my pan
Better than you can
