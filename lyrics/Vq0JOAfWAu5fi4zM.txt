Tears wet the coffin dust
Mourning stains the wooden lid
Through the sadness and depression
I awake in the stone cold grave
Weird glow in the vault around me

A sense of freezing atmosphere
A coffin spirit of past remembrance
Howling at the moon in my memories
All around the cobwebs are silent
Even spiders have died so long ago
Void of life in hear is so definite
I exist but not to live again

In my death the omens were profound
Tongues that uttered curse and doom
Born under the Master's spell
Hungry for the warmth that I would spit on
Tears wet the coffin dust
Mourning stains the wooden lid
Through the sadness and depression
I awake in the stone cold grave
There is no life, no humanity
Nothing to keep me from suffering
Nothing to feed my burning soul with
Nothing to spill my hate upon
