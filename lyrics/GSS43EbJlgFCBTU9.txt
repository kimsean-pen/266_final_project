Lying beside you here in the dark
Feeling your heartbeat with mine
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere
How could i love be so blind

We sailed on together, we drifting apart
And here you are by my side

So now i come, to you with open arms
Nothing to hide believe what i say
so here i am with open arms,
Hoping you'll see what your love means
To me. Open Arms

Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much i wanted to hold

But now that, you've comeback
Turn night into day
I need you to stay

So now i come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide believe what i say
So here i am with open arms
hoping you see what your love means to me, Open Arms.
Hoping you see what your loves mean to me, Open Arms
