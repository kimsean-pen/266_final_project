A Salvation Army band played
And the children drank lemonade
And the morning lasted all day
All day
And through an open window came
Like Sinatra in a younger day

Pushing the town away
Ah

Ah hey ma ma ma

Doo-din-nie-ya-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma
Hey-y-yah
Life in a northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma ma

They sat on the stoney ground

And he took a cigarette out
And everyone else came down
To listen
He said, "In winter 1963
It felt like the world would freeze
With John F. Kennedy
And The Beatles"

Yeah, yeah
Ah hey ma ma ma
Doo-din-nie-ya-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma
Hey-y-yah
Life in a northern town

Hey ma ma ma ma
Ah hey ma ma ma
Ah hey ma ma ma
Hey-y-yah
All the work shut down

The evening turned to rain

Watched the water roll down the drain
As we followed him down
To the station
And though he never would wave goodbye
You could see it written in his eyes
As the train rolled out of sight
Bye-bye

Ah hey ma ma ma
Doo-din-nie-ya-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma
Hey-y-yah
Life in a northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma
Doo-din-nie-ya-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma
Hey-y-yah
Life in a northern town

Ah hey ma ma ma
Doo-din-nie-ya-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma
Hey-y-yah
Ah hey ma ma ma ma
Take it easy on yourself
Ah hey ma ma ma
Doo-din-nie-ya-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma
Hey-y-yah
