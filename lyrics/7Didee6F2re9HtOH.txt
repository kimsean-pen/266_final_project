Me and you know
this is love
and I see

Me and you know
this is love
when I'm around you
when I'm around

ooh

NYC
nobody loves me
no, no
no

NYC
nobody loves me

NYC
nobody loves me
no

Me and you know
this is love

Me and you know
this is love
when I'm around you
when I'm around

ooh

Nobody loves me
no, no

NYC
nobody loves me
