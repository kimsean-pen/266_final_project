What Does It Take to win your love for me?
How can I make this dream come true for me?
Oh, I just got to know,
Oh! Baby, 'cause I love you so,
Gonna blow for you.

I've tried, I've tried, I've tried,
I've tried in ev'ry way I could to make you see how much I love you.
Oh! I thought you understood.
So you gotta make me see,
What Does It Take to win your love for me?
