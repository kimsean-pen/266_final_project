Place the heart
From red wards
I took a spirit touch
LIke cold black earth
Faces and lives slain
How many Russian already

The pressure and ecstasy
Reventration

Memories of Sweat, Memories of Sweat
Memories of Sweat
Memories of Sweat, Memories of Sweat
Memories of Sweat

Fill the lungs with pagan dreams
Know what's the rituals, for young Descartes
Gaze upon a, the thoughts all feels so fatal

Contact and ecstasy
Reventration

Memories of Sweat, Memories of Sweat
Memories of Sweat
Memories of Sweat, Memories of Sweat
Memories of Sweat

No joy No joy
What's the words
Like the words
