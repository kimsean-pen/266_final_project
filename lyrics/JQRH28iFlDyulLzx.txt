Sometimes when I'm in heaven
I get forgetful of the Earth (Woah)
Until I hear you bickering like boys and birds
The heat is on
Gets up when the shade is down
I got a pocketful of deadliness
Opium den mother forget my head
At the dead-end called unsteadiness
Boxed blondes have less fun

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

Oh, I've got the skyline in my veins
Forget your night time
Summer love on a gurney with a squeaky wheel
And joke us, joke us
'Til Lakeshore Drive goes back into focus
I just wanna come back to life
Spark my crazy head to keep your woman alive
I got a pocketful of deadliness
Opium den mother forget my head
At the dead-end called unsteadiness
Boxed blondes have less fun, fun

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

Boomerang my head
To the city I grew up in
Again and again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

Boomerang my head
To the city I grew up in
Again and again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid

Again and again and again and again and again
