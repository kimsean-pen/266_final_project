I've heard of a song without a name
It stays the same
And everyone learns the melodies
It's just the name
We need

Summer, summer
Bring the ghost to me
It's what I want

In its silence
It will let me hear
It's just so fun

Pace yourself to the beat of the drums
I am hoping for something else
Move your hands, tell me what I should learn
This is nothing like I expected

I've heard of a melody
That's in the air
I need you take it off the list
It's only fair to me

Summer, summer
Bring the ghost again
It's what I want

In its silence
It will let me hear
It's just so fun

Pace yourself to the beat of the drums
I am hoping for something else
Move your hands, tell me what I should learn
This is nothing like I expected

And everything you say will turn me on
There's nothing like falling for a ghost in summer clothes

Won't you come to me?
To the safest rock
I will show you its place
