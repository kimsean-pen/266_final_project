There's somebody else inside my head
That's telling me to give up
It's telling me to give up.
I'm being taking down
From the inside out.

I think i'm gonna die here.

I need you now, and nothing's making sense.
This time it's not my perspective.
There's something wrong with me.

I can't seem to agree.
Lets face the facts shall we
My life, my life will never be the same
There's no time to make a change.
I'm hopeless.
I'm broken.

I'm beaten bruised and bleeding.

Oh god where are you now?
I need you now, and nothing's making sense.
This time its not my perspective.
Theres something wrong with me
I can't seem to agree.
And i know it's just what you're thinking.

There's something wrong with me
I can't seem to a agree.

(I put it all on the line for you.)
(I put my life on the line for you.)
I put it all on the line for you.
I put my life on the line for you.

I put my life on the line for you.
So why did you say goodbye to me?
This time its not my perspective.
There's something wrong with me
I can't seem to agree.
And i know it's just what you're thinking.
There's something wrong with me
I can't seem to a agree.
