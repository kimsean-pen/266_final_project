All the neighborhoods you knew and loved
All the streets that you played on
All the streams and the fields and parks
And all the lanes you roamed after dark
All the houses you grew up in
The floorboards you hid money in
The beds where you fucked for love
And all the beds where you fucked for fun

The idea that nobody dies
And when our hearts stop beating, we leave it behind
It's just modern ruin, that's what they'll say
Flesh and blood just rotted away
Steel and concrete titans waiting to be enlightened
All wanna go up in a ball of flame
All wanna burn out, not fade away

The cemeteries and their flesh bouquets
The rivers and the mountain lakes
The copper, the concrete, the iron, and gold
And all the stories that we never told

The idea that nobody dies
And when our hearts stop beating, we leave it behind
It's just modern ruin, that's what they'll say
Flesh and blood just rotted away
Steel and concrete titans waiting to be enlightened
All wanna go up in a ball of flame
All wanna burn out, not fade away

All the nights we stayed up till dawn
All the blankets laid out on the lawn
And all the mornings, and the afternoons
And all the evenings and the night times too
And all the bricks and the mortar you called your home
And all the glass and the metal and the wood and the rope
And all the emptiness you filled with hope
And all the blood and the muscle and the skin and the bone
And all the veins and the cells and the molecules
And all the atoms divided that made up you
And all the vast potential you hold inside
All the infinite darkness and all of the light
