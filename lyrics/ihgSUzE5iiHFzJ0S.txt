There's blood in the water
There's fear in the air
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
And we're all running scared

Ashes to ashes
And dust to dust while bombs never rust
Watch the war on your screen
Yesterday's deals were just a dream

There's blood in the water

Round and round we go
Where this will end nobody knows

There's profit in prophets
Too much money in lies
Missiles fueled by hatred
As the blind lead the blind

Round and round we go
Where this will end nobody knows

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Have we finally run out of road?
You can't build a wall high enough
Can't dig a deep enough hole

Equality, now a profanity
Wave goodbye to humanity
There's a monster under your bed
You created it, so don't be scared

Round and round we go
Where this will end nobody knows

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Have we finally run out of road?
You can't build a wall high enough
Can't dig a deep enough hole

There's blood in the water
(There's blood in the water)
There's fear in the air
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
And we're all running scared

There's blood in the water
Eye for an eye
There's blood in the water
There's blood in the water
Eye for an eye
