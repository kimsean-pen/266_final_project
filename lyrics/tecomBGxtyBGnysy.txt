As I'm walking alone, I remember the times when we played here
Leaving a broken home, making sure we were whole and together
Every failure we shared, every night that we were forsaken
I would dream of a life far away from it all but you
All these words that I left unspoken
I will say when I meet you again
I see you but I can't feel your presence
I feel you but you're fading away

Time is wise and our wounds seem to heal to the rhythm of aging
But our past is a ghost fading out that at night it's still haunting
We are growing apart, still I know that inside you're aching
But the scars that we share will remind us of who we are

All these words that I left unspoken
I will say when I meet you again
I see you but I can't feel your presence
I feel you but you're fading away
Let it all wither
Let it all wither and let it go
Let it all wither
Let it all wither and let it go
Let it all wither
Let it all wither and let it go
Let it all wither
Let it all wither and let it go
Let it all wither
Let it all wither and let it go
Let it all wither
