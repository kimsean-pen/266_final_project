I tell myself
You don't mean a thing
But what we got
Got not hold on me
But when you're not there
I just crumble
I tell myself
That I don't care that much
But I feel like I'm dying
Till I feel your touch

Only love
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must have been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this

Say I wouldn't care
If you walked away
But everytime you're there
I'm begging you to stay
When you come close
I just tremble
And everytime
Everytime you go
It's like a knife that cuts
Right through my soul

Only love
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must have been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burning through my skin
Only love can hurt like this

But if the sweetest pain
Burning hot through my veins
Love is torture
Makes me more sure

Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must have been the deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burning to my skin
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this

Save me
Save me
Only love
Only love
Cause only love can hurt this
And it must have been the deadly kiss
