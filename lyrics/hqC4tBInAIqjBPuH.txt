Good morning, mister sunshine
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me
In your way
I see you every morning
Outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant

Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman

Good morning, mister sunshine
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way

Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days, lonely nights
here would I be without my woman
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, lonely days, lonely nights
