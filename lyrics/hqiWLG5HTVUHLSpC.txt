I'm staring down a stream of sweet impressions
I'm waiting just to sense that special presence

I feel I wanna need somebody
And they can say I'm fine
There's nothing wrong with me
Somebody sees
Don't you believe me, honey

I crawled up on the stage and felt so sleazy
But when I saw their faces it came easy
It freed me
Believe you me

And if you're gonna love somebody
You gotta lose some pride
But you can't be part of somebody else
Didn't they tell you, honey
Alright

Just like you said about your old boyfriend
And how he screamed his wasted song to the wind

And also, you were talking about the teenage mom
The cellar stairs that she was crying upon

Said you could tell me about a pissed-off kid
Oh and I'm sure he'll be ashamed what he did

I'm even feeling for his desperate and doped-out dad
So dumb he doesn't know when he's feeling bad

My friend he told me that I can't depend
On anything that doesn't come from within
Oh but my God, how am I ever gonna help the world
When I can't even heal the heart of my girl

I got a need that I just can't see through
I gotta guess that I'm exactly like you
And more and more I get a tightness 'bout right here in my chest
You lie in bed all day just getting depressed

Oh it's so bad I wanna break that wall
That always seems to cut me off from you all
Oh but I guess I should accept the way the world, as it stands
It's spinning totally outside of my hands
Lost in the stars, that are singing their light
Across a hundred million miles

And if you're gonna love somebody
You gotta lose some pride
But you can't be part of somebody else
Didn't they tell you, honey

And if you're gonna love somebody
You gotta lose some pride
But you can't be part of somebody else
Didn't they tell you, honey

You gotta love somebody
You gotta love somebody
But you can't be part of somebody else
Didn't they tell you, honey
