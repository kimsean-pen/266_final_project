I'm real real gone
I got hit by a bow and arrow
You got me down to the very marrow
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real real gone

On the radio
Music coming and I hear
Sam Cooke's voice
Well I know I don't have any choice
That's the way it is
And I'm real, real real gone, man

I can't stand up by myself
Don't you know, baby, I need your help
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real real gone, alright

Well, I'm dancing
Dancing till my, till my body's soaking wet
Till I'm completely wet with sweat
Once I've started I'm just real real gone, man
I got hit by a bow and arrow
Got me down to the very marrow
You're a friend of mine, and I'm
Real gone, man

Well the music's playing
On the radio
And the night is filled with space
When my fingertips touch your face
You're a friend of mine
And I'm, I'm real real gone

Help me stand up
Help me stand up
All by myself
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real, I'm real real gone
Real gone
I got hit by a bow and arrow
