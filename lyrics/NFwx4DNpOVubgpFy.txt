One Saturday I took a walk to Zipperhead
I met a girl there
And she almost knocked me dead
(Punk rock girl) Please look at me
(Punk rock girl) What do you see?
Let's travel round the world
Just you and me, punk rock girl

I tapped her on the shoulder
And said, "Do you have a beau?"
She looked at me and smiled
And said she did not know
(Punk rock girl) Give me a chance
(Punk rock girl) Let's go slam dance
We'll dress like Minnie Pearl
Just you and me, punk rock girl

We went to the Philly Pizza Company
And ordered some hot tea
The waitress said, "Well, no
We only have it iced"
So we jumped up on the table
And shouted "anarchy"
And someone played a Beach Boys song
On the jukebox
It was "'California Dreamin'"
So we started screamin'
"On such a winter's day"

She took me to her parents
For a Sunday meal
Her father took one look at me
And he began to squeal
(Punk rock girl) It makes no sense
(Punk rock girl) Your dad is the Vice President
Rich as the Duke of Earl
Yeah, you're for me, punk rock girl

We went to a shopping mall
And laughed at all the shoppers
And security guards trailed us
To a record shop
We asked for Mojo Nixon
They said, "He don't work here"
We said, "If you don't got Mojo Nixon
Then your store could use some fixin'"

We got into a car
Away we started rollin'
I said, "How much you pay for this?"
She said, "Nothing, man, it's stolen"
(Punk rock girl) You look so wild
(Punk rock girl) Let's have a child
We'll name her Minnie Pearl
Just you and me
Eat fudge banana swirl
Just you and me
We'll travel round the world
Just you and me, punk rock girl
