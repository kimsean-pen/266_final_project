Swizz Beatz (um hum) woo oh, Swizz Beatz, E-V-E, Mashonda, Ryde Out!

Yo, betcha never heard of a joint so knocking

I'mma take control and join this chart topper
Got no time to sit down, you just got to jump up
I need your attention, listen to me see

Where you all belong now
Nigga is you with me
Move your body (uh)
Nigga this is it
Feel this hotness, that I spit
On the Swizz Beatz
And it get's no sicker than this
Ya like that, nothing crazier or even exist
Dj spin it off, and watch the crowd flip (wow)

I want to party in the rain
(Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain)
Things will never be the same
(Things won't be the same)
I want to party in the rain
(Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain)
Things won't be the same no

Uh, hey yo, this thing so crazy

Don't know what to call it that
Call it rock n roll
All this shit sounding the same
Had to switch the pitch
Change it up ya mean
Gotta stay that bitch
How you feel, when you hear this
Wasn't prepared boy
I need the listeners on the dance floor
Go head boy
You in yo spot, play the shit loud, run around
Make ya neighbor's, call the police
See'mon go head get wild
Some of y'all against this shit
Really against this chick
This for the niggas who love me
Go head a get bent
And if you really want people
To think you insane
Open up your door, let it pour
Party in the rain!

Uh, hey yo, be careful this one here is crazy
I don't want to scare you
Clearly I'm just tryin' to party
And you niggas hear me
I ain't really never want to let myself go
But I'ma give it now
You can't really fuck with this flow
If you just sitting down
Now is you with me, or are you bullshitting

Messing with my concentration
With me I gotta go
I know you ready to shout it out
Yo this chick's incredible
And it's more to come from baby girl

Slow down now I'm loosing my breath
I think I might
Move back now ready no not yet
Almost there

Bring it back one time
Here we go again
And party till the sunshine!
