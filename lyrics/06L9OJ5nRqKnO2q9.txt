I think you heard me wrong
I hear your eyes
I think it came out wrong
A pillow of lies

Oh, baby please
Oh, my heart's on the pavement
Oh, baby please
Oh, my heart's on the pavement
Where we're building you and me
Don't cry that way

Oh, no need to hold your head so low
Don't let that devil get you down
The words I use are way too strong or unstable
Come on baby

Oh, my heart's on the pavement
Oh, baby please
Oh, my heart's on the pavement
Where we're building you and me
Don't cry that way

I wanna see your smile
I wanna see your smile

Oh, baby please
Oh, my heart's on the pavement
Oh, baby please
Oh, my heart's on the pavement
Where we're building you and me
Don't cry that way

Mhm yourselves
Give me all of you
Give me all of you
My sugarcane
Taste of you
Give me all of you
Taste of you
Give me all of you
Taste of you
Give me all of you
Taste of you
Give me all of you
Taste of you
Give me all of you
Taste of you
Give me all of you
