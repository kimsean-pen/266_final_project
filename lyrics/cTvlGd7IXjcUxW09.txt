I rest my head
Between the bed and sky
Download my dread
Disarm my mind
Make it dry

Nothing in motion, and I'm satisfied
No disappointment, until I wake up
Don't want to wake up

Into clear space
Vivid vision
See her shape
At my bedside
Beam up my mind please

There's nothing in motion, and I'm satisfied
No disappointment, until I wake up

There's nothing in motion, and I'm satisfied
No disappointment, until I wake up
I don't want to wake up
Ooh, Oooooooh, Oooooooh

Nothing in motion, and I'm satisfied
No disappointment, until I wake up

There's nothing in motion, and I'm satisfied
No disappointment, until I wake up
I don't want to wake up, no
I don't want to wake up, no
Ooh, Ooh

I don't want to wake up, no
