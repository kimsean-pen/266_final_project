Let me tell you
About the cowardice
Of no convictions
Let me show you some cold
Rationalizations

The clever ways I've devised
For dodging confrontation
How I play devil's advocate
If I want a second opinion
Come one

It's not that I don't care
I'm just tired of going nowhere
On the circle
(On the circle)
On the circle river

It's not that I don't care
I'm just tired of going nowhere
On the circle
(On the circle)
On the circle river

When will we realize?
It's all been capsized
When will we realize?
