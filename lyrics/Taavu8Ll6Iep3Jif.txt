The city's made of diamonds
And tomorrow glass will grow
All the freedoms that divide us
They're coming after me
Flashback nineteen eighty four
Now who's knock, knocking at your door?
A thought that starts a riot
They're coming after me

Now, life is not the same
I am one, but sparks turn into flames

Will you take what's in my head
And erase me when I'm dead
Cause the future is now
Now I'm disappearing
The day has turned to night
Can you save me from the light?
Cause the future is here
This is how I disappear

Running down a spiral
With the light of better men
Shouting progress is survival
Take one last look and see me
Now you see me, now you don't
No valid break, no string of hope
My hero your pariah
They're coming after me

Now, life is just God's game
I am one
But sparks turn into flames

And you get what you deserve
When revenge is what you serve
Cause the future is now
Now I'm disappearing
I sink into the night
And I'm turning off the lights
Cause the future is here
This is how I disappear

So the end's when you make that
And that's what your looking for
This is the future
Future is now

Disappear
Disappear
I disappear
Disappear

Now turn off the lights
The skys are blue inside you
Turn off the lights
They'll get inside of you

Will you take what's in my head
And erase me when I'm dead
Cause the future is now
Now I'm disappearing
The day has turned to night
Can you save me from the light?
Cause the future is here
This is how I disappear

Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
