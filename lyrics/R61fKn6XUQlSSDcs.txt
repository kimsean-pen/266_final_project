Ooops, alright
I'll come right over
pour myself over you
jars of fun
exciting stories
I'll make you forget
tickle you a little bit
seduce out your good temper
I'll shine all over
I'll cook my best dish for you
but then it's my turn
I want all your adoration
dog, I own you
sit down fool
you own me
I'm yours
I'm the sun
I'll shine all over you
grab the rays
sugar
