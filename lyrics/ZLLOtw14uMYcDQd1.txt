Go fuck yourself!

Rephrase what you'll never say,
There's another, way to say the things
It's over, cause you'll never be able to assume what you think
Say this right!

What's wrong with breaking down the walls surrounding us?
And see what's behind
'Cause it's all 'bout honesty,
There's no rule in this place,
You'd better know this!

Let's talk about the things that are worth running for
And that's the good ones,
You should feel free to say
What is true, what's unfair,
You wanna say this right!

Rephrase what you'll never say
You're a failure
You're another piece of shit, you fuck!
Fuck that motherfucker!
Say this right!

What's wrong with breaking down the walls surrounding us?
And see what's behind
Cause it's all 'bout honesty
There's no rule in this place
You better know this!

Let's talk about the things that are worth running for
And that's the good ones...
You should feel free to say
What is true, what's unfair,
You wanna say this right!

This is another fight but that's a fucked up round!
You'll never get this right, you are just falling down

Say this right!
Motherfucker!

What's wrong with breaking down the walls?
And say this right!
This is another fight but that's a fucked up round!

You'll never get this right
You are just falling down.
