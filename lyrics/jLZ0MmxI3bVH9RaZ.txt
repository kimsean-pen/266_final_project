Evil lurks in the mind of a mad man

Kill 'em off like dis, biddy-bah-bah-bye-bye
S-P-I-C-E-1 dem say him Born II Die, blaow
Kill 'em off like dat, biddy-bah-bah-bah-bang
S-P-I-C-E-1 dem say him pull loose thang
Nigga, I can't get fucked in this game I'm a psychopath
My AK told me to shove him up some niggas ass
I'm having long conversations with Mr. Millimeter
He's one of my best friends bitch ass nigga eater
Kill 'em off like dis, biddy-bah-bah-bye-bye
S-P-I-C-E-1 dem say him Born II Die, blaow
Kill 'em off like dat, biddy-bah-bah-bah-bang
S-P-I-C-E-1 dem say him pull loose thang

Smoke lines on my face from the cigarettes always burning
Combination of the drugs and the chronic got me slurring
It's that don't fear no busta
187 a sucka
Kill a motherfucker
Coming out of nothing
Me love da gun, me love to kill a rat
Me smoking on a sack, turn me into psychopath
Chomp chomp, eat another Xan
Me don't fear no man that can bleed like I can
Rag on my face like I am Taliban
This scene is the ocean and I am the sandman
Hold up, let me glo up
Ruby with the stance while my eyes steady rolling
Uzi get the bands while I stick up and I hold 'em
Screaming "fuck the man" while the middle fingers go up
That redrum that redrum
Written all on my bedroom

Kill 'em off like dis, biddy-bah-bah-bye-bye
S-P-I-C-E-1 dem say him Born II Die, blaow
Kill 'em off like dat, biddy-bah-bah-bah-bang
S-P-I-C-E-1 dem say him pull loose thang

I been picking flies off the eyelids of sinners' kids
Coming to claim your religion, opinion formed by television
Never listen to the voices inside of your fucking head
I died and now I'm dead
What is life when you're in debt to the reaper?
Fuck a hole dig deeper whether it is in
the ground or spread apart by bitch's fingers
Let me linger
Hook, line, and sinker
Trained by the teacher
Raped by the preacher
Not saved by the leader
Put a blade to his neck
Told him "run away and never look back. That's a threat"
Then I turned to the flock and said "you're no longer oppressed"
But they follow me anyway
Never taught to think for themselves
Belt tied around my neck
I'm the $uicidal $hepherd
$now Leopard bounce a check
Hot boy bitch I'm peppered
Never gave a fuck what a bitch boy got to say
He can never levitate from out his motherfucking grave
