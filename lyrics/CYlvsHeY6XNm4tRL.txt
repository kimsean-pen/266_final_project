She knows, I'mma be her boy forever
And she knows, I'm gonna have it all or better
I can't be going up to this girl, no
When I look at her she's all I wanted
She's got my back and I know it
She only does it because she loves it
She knows, I work hard
Says she's got stress it too
I can't pick a fight with you
I recognize you're on my side
I know why she's stuck in?
Call me daily just to say you hate it
What's the point of calling
When all I get is nothing
She goes, through it all
If she wasn't by herself
I'm the one who needs her help
But we can go buy your Denny's?
She's out while I'm busy playing
But that she doesn't really call it playing
So why do I still go?
When you, talk about, how your room shakes at night
I wonder if you spend that time
Taking photos with a friend of mine
We don't gotta fake these smiles
I don't wanna waste your time
(I don't wanna, I don't wanna,
I don't wanna waste your time)
