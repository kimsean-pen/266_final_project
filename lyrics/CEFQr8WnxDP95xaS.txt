Define your meaning of war
To me, it's what we do when we're bored
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
And it makes me want it more
Because I'm hyped up, outta control
If it's a fight, I'm ready to go
I wouldn't put my money on the other guy
If you know what I know that I know

It's been a long time comin'
And the table's turned around
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down
I'm not runnin'
It's a little different now
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down

Define your meaning of fun
To me, it's when we're gettin' it done
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
So get ready for another one
Let's take a trip down memory lane
The words circulate in my brain
You can treat this like another, all the same
But don't cry like a bitch when you feel the pain

It's been a long time comin'
And the table's turned around
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down
I'm not runnin'
It's a little different now
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down

This is hardly worth fighting for
But it's the little petty shit that I can't ignore
With my fist in your face
And your face on the floor
It'll be a long time comin'
Bet you got the message now
'Cause I was never goin'
Yeah, you're the one that's goin' down

One of us is goin' down
I'm not runnin'
It's a little different now
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down

One of us is goin' down
