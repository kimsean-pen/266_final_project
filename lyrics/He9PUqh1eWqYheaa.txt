Here comes ol' Rosie, she's lookin' mighty fine
Here comes hot Nancy, she's steppin' right on time
Here go the street lights, bringin' on the night
Here come the men, faces hidden from the light
All through the shadows, ahh they come and they go
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below
Here come the rich man, in his big long limousine
Here come the poor man, ah he's got to have his dream
Here come the banker, and the lawyer, and the cop
One thing for certain it ain't never goin' to stop
When it all gets too heavy
That's when they come and they go... they go
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below
Yeah, it happens out in Vegas
And it happens in Moline
On the blue-blood streets of Boston
Up in Berkley, out in Queens
And it went on yesterday, and it's goin' on tonight
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right
And he's lookin' out for Rosie, She's lookin' mighty fine
An he's walkin' the streets for Nancy
And he'll find her every time
And when the street lights flicker, bringing on the night
Well they'll be slippin' into darkness, slippin' outta sight
All through to midnight
Watch 'em come and watch 'em go... oh go
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below
Ohhh burnin' down below

Aye, it happens out in Vegas
Happens in Moline
On the blueblood streets of Boston
Up in Berkley, and out in Queens
And then it went on yesterday
It's goin' on tonight
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right
An he's lookin' out for Rosie, she's lookin' mighty fine
And he's walkin' the streets for Nancy
And he find her every time
An when the street lights flicker, bringin' on the night
Well they'll be slippin' into darkness, slippin' outta sight
All through the shadows
Well watch 'em come and watch 'em go... oh they go
And only one thing in common
They got the fire down below
Ohhh they got one thing in common
They got the fire down below
Only got one thing in common
They got the fire down below
