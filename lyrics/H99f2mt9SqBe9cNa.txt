It's me again your worthless friend or foe
I somehow let that lovely creature down
Horsin' around, horsin' around
Some things we check and double check and lose
I guess I let that little vow get lost
Forgettin' the cost, forgettin' the cost

Quick to forgive and so slow to blame, the very thought fills me with shame
But that didn't stop it happening

The thrill of it - can I call it that? - was cheap
And feeling cheap's the only thing you keep
It's so unsightly to walk from her arms so lightly
Selling it all up the swanee

Horsin' around's a serious business, last thing you'd want somebody to witness
I was the fool who always presumed that I'd wear the shoes and you'd be the doormat
You wonder why my hands are still shaking: In need of a cry the shoulders are taken...

I deserve to be kicked so badly
You deserve more than I sold you for
Horsin' around, horsin' around

The moral is whatever else you learn
You shouldn't let that lovely creature down
Lord just blind me, don't let her innocent eyes remind me
Selling it all up the swanee
Horsin' around, horsin' around.
