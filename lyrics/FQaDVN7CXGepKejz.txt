Got answers for everyone endless excuses
Not habit for anyone 'cos I'm trying to break your click track heart
Seen a vision of perfect grace airbrushed and lifeless
All contempt and aftertaste, it's like I'm waiting for the scars to heal

You sew Loretta Young Silks, fashioning your self-escape
You sew Loretta Young Silks, trading on your super waif
All style before content using me as bait
You sew Loretta Young Silks, swapping your love for hate

Soft-focus for full appeal pictured as flawless
No context for self-esteem, I'd be pushed to give you love on that
As far as the eye can see too much perfection
Pure substance for wannabes keeps you beating to a click track heart
