Let us burn one, from end to end
And pass it over to me my friend
Burn it long, but burn it slow, to light me up before I go
If you dont like my fire, then dont come around
Cause I'm gonna burn one down
Yes I'm gonna burn one down

Yeah

My choice is what I choose to do
And if I'm causing no harm it shouldn't bother you
Your choice is who you choose to be
And if you're causing no harm, then you're alright with me
If you don't like my fire then don't come around
Cause I'm gonna burn one down
Yes I'm gonna burn one, down

Herb's a gift, from the earth
And what's from the earth is of the greatest worth
So before you knock it, try it first
Oh you'll see it's a blessing and it's not a curse
If you don't like my fire, then don't come around
Cause I'm gonna burn one down
Yes I'm gonna burn one...

Oh
