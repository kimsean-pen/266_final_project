Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me
I know you're ready to go
I'm, I'm ready to go

Jaw drop, heart stop, the eye lock
I must be dreaming, don't hit the alarm clock
Under the lights, coming alive, she's thriller tonight
ay ay ay
One dance, two dance is not enough
You got that glow on the darks, so now giving up
I'm reading your mind you know I'm a psychic
Why you try to hide it hide it?

Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me
I know you're ready to go
Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me
Don't leave me out on the floor
I'm saying woah-oh-oh-oh
Don't tell me no-oh-oh-oh
(Wooooah)
Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me
I'm, I'm, I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
Love me love me, lo-love me lo-love me
Love me love me, lo-love me
I'm ready to go

Cant stop, won't stop, your party rock
You got that red of you're lips, sweet, like Betty Crock-ER
So call a doc-TER
'Cause someone needs to take your temperature, you're getting hotter
Under the lights, coming alive, she's thriller tonight
I'm reading your mind you know I'm a psychic
Why you try to hide it hide it?
When I rock, you roll
You're losing control
And if you got that feeling throw your hands up in the air

Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me
I know you're ready to go
(I know you're ready to go)
Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me
Don't leave me out on the floor
I'm saying woah-oh-oh-oh
Don't tell me no-oh-oh-oh
(Wooooah)
Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me
I'm, I'm, I'm ready to go
I'm, I'm ready to go

You be Juliet, I'll be Romeo
What you waiting for you know you wanna go
(I'm ready to go)
Don't say goodbye, 'cause we just said hello
Say you're gonna love me girl, 'cause I need to know

Ready? Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go
Ready? Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go
Let's do this

Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me
I know you're ready to go
(I know you're ready to go)
Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me
Don't leave me out on the floor
I'm saying woah-oh-oh-oh
Don't tell me no-oh-oh-oh
(Wooooah)
Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me
I'm, I'm, I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
Love me love me, lo-love me lo-love me
Love me love me, lo-love me
I'm ready to go
Love me love me, lo-love me lo-love me
Love me love me, lo-love me
I'm ready to go
