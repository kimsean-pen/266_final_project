One step closer, I'm feeling fine
Getting better one day at a time
I'm moving forward, it's all in my mind
I'm heading talk without new stay to mine

So I will hold back tears
Move in the right direction
Face my fears
Move in the right direction
I'm doing fine
One step closer every day at the time
I won't lose my mind
Lose my mind, ah-ah, oo

Motivation, a powerful strength
Hesitation was my first instinct
I got the notion that weakness was
Total devotion, it's okay, because

I will hold back tears
So I can move in the right direction
I have faced my fears
Now, I can move in the right direction
I'm doing fine
One step closer every day at the time
I won't lose my mind
Lose my mind, ah-ah, oo

Keeping my head up (oo), looking forward (oo)
Reminiscing will get you nowhere (ah)
Never say never, starting over (ah)
It's not perfect, but it's getting closer

I will hold back tears
So I can move in the right direction
I have faced my fears
Now, I can move in the right direction
I'm doing fine
One step closer every day at the time
I won't lose my mind
Lose my mind, ah-ah, oo
