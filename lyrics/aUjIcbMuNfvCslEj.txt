It never seems enough
And baby when your head is full of stuff
Then again you didn't go
And thank god you didn't though

What's it gonna take
Baby for the two of us to make
It through this one
Can we make it through this song?

Everything between us makes me glow
But how could you know?
Simple things bring simple pleasures
That we know
Or maybe they didn't show

2 used 2 means 2 hearts 2 please
2 you 2 me 2 make totally
2 mouths 2 closed 2 make all of those
2 hearts 2 believe 2 love openly

Do you really wanna wait another day?
Coz everybody needs a little time to pay
And after when the time is up
Everybody doesnt always get their say
Feels like a little price to pay
Then after we laugh it up

Everything about us makes me grow
But how would you know?
Simple things bring simple pleasures
That we know
Baby it's time to show

2 used 2 means 2 hearts 2 please
2 you's 2 me's 2 make totally
2 mouths 2 closed 2 make all of those
2 hearts 2 believe 2 love openly

You're the must have
You're the part
I'm in your palm
Love freely
So really
There's a call
Where's it from?

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

2 used 2 means 2 hearts 2 please
2 you's 2 me's 2 make totally
2 mouths 2 closed 2 make all of those
2 hearts 2 believe 2 love openly (x2)
