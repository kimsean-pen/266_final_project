Easy as we watch it fall apart
It fades so slow
Deeper as we're making every mark
It's what we know
And it's just getting heavy
See you carry it round but I can feel it slip
As we loose our grip
But it goes on repeating
Seeing everything we're giving up
It's just too much

And it's too late
Taking it too far
So tell me, is it real
When you push so hard?
It's too late
Taking it too far
So tell me how to feel

When you push so hard

Trying to keep our heads from closing in
To ease my mind
Knowing that it sinks under the skin
We take our time
And it's just getting heavy
See you carry it round but I can feel it slip
As we loose our grip
So cold when you're near me

Keep it distant till we've had enough
It's just too much

And it's too late
Taking it too far
So tell me, is it real
When you push so hard?
It's too late

Taking it too far
So tell me how to feel
When you push so hard

When you push so
When you push so hard
When you push so
When you push so hard
When you push so
When you push so hard
When you push so
When you push so hard
