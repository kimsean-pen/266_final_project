How many people don't understand
How many feel what we feel baby?
How many try to change us again and again
But we don't need nobody

How many people don't understand
How many feel what we feel baby?
How many try to change us again and again
But we don't need nobody

How many try to change us again and again
But we don't need nobody

If they only knew the things that we could be
If they only felt this kind of chemistry
Nobody would tell us, tell us what to do
They got nothing on me and you

How many people don't understand
How many feel what we feel baby?
How many try to change us again and again
But we don't need nobody
