Do you think that I can get some? (chickie chickie)
Maybe gets a little finga, (sticky sticky)
You my electrical lip balm flava
I gotta do ya until the next song saves ya

And can I get a little zip zip (lookie lookie)
Maybe just a little uh uh (nookie nookie)
Hey whatcha say, it doesn't matter anyway
You won't do another 'cause you're getting with me

She got the power, of the hootchie
I got the fever for the flava of the cootchie
And did I mention, hey pay attention
Gonna take that bootie to the nudie dimension

I got the green glow, under my car
I got the boom boom system you can hear real far

Oh hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

Just a little somethin' somethin' (itty bitty)
Do you wanna get triple x groovie
Gimme gimme some of that kinda movie

And let me spin ya like a record (wicky wicky)
Let me get you butt naked (licky licky)
Here we go yo, here's the scenario
Gonna strip you down like a car in the barrio

Ya got the power, of the hootchie
I got the fever for the flava of the cootchie

You gotta be my first Lady, jack it

She got the power, of the hootchie
I got the fever for the flava of the cootchie
Let's party hardy and rock n' roll
We drink Bacardi and smoke a bowl
