Sound the bugle now
Play it just for me
As the seasons change
Remember how I used to be

Now I can't go on
I can't even start
I've got nothing left
Just an empty heart

I'm a soldier
Wounded so I must give up the fight
There's nothing more for me, lead me away
Or leave me lying here

Sound the bugle now
Tell them I don't care
There's not a road I know
That leads to anywhere

Without a light
I fear that I will stumble in the dark
Lay right down
Decide not to go on

Then from on high
Somewhere in the distance
There's a voice that calls
"Remember who your are"

If you lose yourself
Your courage soon will follow
So be strong tonight
Remember who you are

Yeah
You're a soldier now
Fighting in a battle
To be free once more
Yeah, that's worth fighting for
