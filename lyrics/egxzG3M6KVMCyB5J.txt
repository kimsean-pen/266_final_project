Woo oow Woo oow Woo oo oo
Woo oow Woo oow Woo oo oo
Woo oow Woo oow Woo oo oo
Woo oow Woo oow Woo oo oo
Deep down I know that you're troubled
Living underneath the weight, your chains, your strain
No straighter path then to struggle
'Cause when we rest we fear
And it draws them near
I hear the sirens call me on
The silent call from far beyond
For those who hear to sing along
Saying Woo oow Woo oow Woo oo oo
Woo oow Woo oow Woo oo oo

You're trying hard not to crumble
No reason left to be brave, to fight, to save
Back broke sifting through the rubble
But when we stop, it starts
To the beat of your aching heart
I hear the sirens call me on
The silent call from far beyond
For those who hear to sing along
Saying Woo oow Woo oow Woo oo oo
Who's gonna fight the tide
I'm gonna hold the line
If this is the last dance
Me I'd rather take chances
Before the music stops

I'm gonna fight the tide
Are you gonna hold the line
Who's gonna carry the flag
Are you gonna be the one
Who's gonna fight the tide
I'm gonna hold the line
If this is the last dance
Me I'd rather take chances
Before the music stops
