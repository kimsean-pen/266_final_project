Do you remember back in old l.a. (wo-oh-oh)
when everybody drove a chevrolet (wo-oh-oh)
whatever happened to the boy next door,
suntanned, crewcut, all-american male?
Remember dancing at the high school hop
the dress i ruined with the soda pop?
i didn't recognized the girl next door
with beatup sneakers and a pony tail
beach baby, beach baby, give me your hand
give me something that i can remember
just like before, we can walk by the shore
in the moonlight.
Beach baby, beach baby, there on the sand
from july to the end of september
surfin' was fun, we'd be out in the sun every day.
Oooh. i never thought that it would end
oooha oooha
oooh. and i was everybody's friend
long hot days, blue sea haze
juke box plays, but now it's fading away.
...
aaahh aahh aah. aah
We could'nt wait for graduation day
we took my car and drove to san jose
that's where you told me that you'd wear my ring
i guess you don't remember anything!

Beach baby, beach baby, give me your hand
give me something I can remember
just like before, we could walk by the shore
in the moonlight
Beach baby, beach baby, there on the sand
from July to the end of September
surf'n was fun, we'd be out in the sun every day
ooooh...
bom bom didi do
Vocal harmonies and stylings
do do do, do do .
Beach baby, beach baby, beach baby etc.
