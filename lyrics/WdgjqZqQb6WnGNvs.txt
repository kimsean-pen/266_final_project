Auhhh
Auhhh
Auhhh
Auhhh
You want greatness, you wanna taste it
You wanna be a king (be a king)
You wanna make it, don't wanna fake it
You wanna levitate (levitate)
You want love, want truth, wanna feel brand new
You wanna do it, do it, do it
You got dreams
You got dreams
You got dreams
You got dreams
But there's something in between, man
And you're stuck there underneath them
So get up
Get up now, now, now
Get up
Get up now, now, now
Put your head on straight
Put your head on now, now, now, now
Get up, get on, get out, get up
Fly away, little birdie
Auhhh
Auhhh
Auhhh
Auhhh
You're so sad, you're so gone, you're so lost
You're so sad, you're so down
I wanna pick you up and put you in the clouds
You want love, want truth, wanna feel brand new
You wanna do it, do it, do it
You got dreams, you got dreams, you got dreams, you got dreams
And you wanna set 'em free, man
But you're stuck there underneath them
So get up
Get up now, now, now
Get up
Get up now, now, now
Put your head on straight
Put your head on now, now, now, now
Get up, get on, get out, get up
Fly away, little birdie
Auhhh uuhhh
Auhhh uuhhh
Fly away little birdie
Auhhh uuhhh
Auhhh uuhhh
For such a little thing
You sure are in your own way
I'd love to give you wings
But babe you've got to grow them
So get up, get up now, now, now
Get up
Get up now, now, now
Put your head on straight
Put your head on now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now
So get up
Get up now, now, now
Get up
Get up now, now, now
Put your head on straight
Put your head on now, now, now, now
Get up, get on, get out, get up
Fly away, little birdie
Auhhh uuhhh (get up, get up, get up)
Auhhh uuhhh
Fly away little birdie
Auhhh uuhhh (get up, put your head on straight)
Auhhh uuhhh (put your head on)
Fly away
Get up
