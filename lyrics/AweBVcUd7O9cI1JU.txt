Church bells resounded like judgement day
As they were making love in the rainswept graveyard
She fucked him hard, silhouetted by flames
A monsoon Tigress set upon prey

Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
This delectable reaper, her eyes were profound
Drawing him in deeper until he was drowned
Hurled on the shore of the world underground
Lilith Immaculate

Mortal kind, a morbid wine
For this dark moon goddess
And freed to stretch her claws
This beautiful whore would be brutally honest
Tortuous one, taboos undone
A glittering star on a sea of myriad waves
And a thickening mist, a seductress
Leading lovesick hearts astray

Lilith

In the throes of orgasm, she bucked and he broke
At the height of the storm, the chaos they'd smote
Burning behind her in arabesque smoke
Framed a vision transformed as she sucked from his throat

Victoria smiled, her now golden eyes
Possessed a regal bearing of omnipotent power
From wet lips to her smoldering thighs
Her beauty perfected and her will agonised

Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more the master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
With dread single purpose, her mind told him stay
She strode through the fire, desire aflame
She murdered the nuns in such horrible ways
Lilith Immaculate

That night we lay entwined on hay inside a soldier's barn
Her panting breath an opiate as in her bolder grasp
I caught the scent of desert sands
The Holy lands, the fall of reason
But only when I smelt the blood did I fear her colder hand
"I am darkness, I am sin
The Queen of lust invited in
Reborn at last to cast my fecund shadow on this world
You shall worship me, enslaved
For many lovers shall I crave
And in return, I'll gladly pave your psycho path with pearls
For I have been grating, and waiting
So long to find the most perfect hostess close to me
Whose thin-ice troubled mind
Was like a cracked, black ornate mirror
To slip right through in time
When at last I wore Harmonia's necklace
The cursed twin serpents mine"
Tortuous one, debauchery won
The attention of Emperors, Princes and Tsars
For the toll of her kiss, no soul could dismiss
The advance of her throne from afar

This English rose with traits of those
Who graced the harems of the East
Adorned with thorns, she raised the horns
And scarlet hems to wasted priests

Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
This delectable reaper, her eyes were profound
They drew him in deeper until he was drowned
Hurled on the shore of the world underground
Lilith Immaculate
Fall for the love of me
Crawl for the love of me
Drool for the love of my virulent sway
I grow more master the faster the days
Lilith Immaculate
The flutes and sweet wine of her voice anodyne
Her power was growing every hour malign
The truth, Lilith's kingdom drew closer with time
Lilith Immaculate
