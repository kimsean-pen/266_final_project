Take this bloody war of mine away
I'm lost for words to say
Will they greet me at dawn

Take these muddy thoughts that are my walls
I'm not ready for the call
That will greet me at dawn

I just take what someone wants
Race when I'm in front
Break what i don't need
It's nice to watch somebody breathe, for me
I am tired of my own

Well now come sit next to me
I'm not sleeping with a bride to be
And I thank you very much
And I'm flattered by the touch
When you say that you're in love with me

And I sat here for eternity
No wife and no family
Been wasting time like it just doesn't matter very much
So I'm happy for the company
Won't you breathe for me
I am tired of my own

Race me to the horror at the end
I've lost myself again
In the mirror of my past

Let me, let me scratch at my own skin
I'm dying to get in
To the mirror of my past

I just take what someone wants
Race when I'm in front
Break what I don't need
It's nice to watch somebody breathe, for me
I am tired of my own

Well now come sit next to me
I'm not sleeping with a bride to be
And I'll thank you very much
And I'm flattered by the touch
When you say that you're in love with me

And I sat here for eternity
No wife and no family
Been wasting time like it just doesn't matter very much
So I'm happy for the company
Won't you breathe for me
I am tired of my own

And won't you breathe for me
I am tired of my own

Well now come sit next to me
I'm not sleeping with a bride to be
And I'll thank you very much
And I'm flattered by the touch
When you say that you're in love with me

And I sat here for eternity
No Wife and no family
Been wasting time like it just doesn't matter very much
So I'm happy for the company

And I sat here for eternity
No wife and no family
Been wasting time like it just
Doesn't matter very much
So I'm happy for the company

Won't you breathe for me
I am tired of my own

And won't you breathe for me
I am tired of my own
