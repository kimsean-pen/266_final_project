Jawbreaker

Hey just to be polite yunno
Well I'll ask about yourself if I choose
But we both know
There's a past, bad blood an' such
It makes me wanna spit

I caught your evil eye
One ugly inner child

Life felt slow in the past
And yet little by little bits
Creep on up, history,
Took the day at least a part of it

Jawbreaker

I caught your evil eye
One ugly inner child
I felt your evil eye
Like a needle in the side

Are you part of them
Or part of me
You bother them
And you bother me

Are you part of them
Or part of me
You bother them
And you bother me

I caught your evil eye
One ugly inner child
I caught your evil eye
Still I bleed, inner child
I caught your evil eye
One ugly inner child

I caught your evil eye
