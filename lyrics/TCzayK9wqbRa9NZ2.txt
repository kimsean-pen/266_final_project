Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy
You already know
That I'm all yours
What you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need
Promiscuous boy
Let's get to the point
'Cause we're on roll
You ready?

Roses are red
Some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead
But you're still kind a cute
Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come too

I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?

They call me Thomas
Last name Crown
Recognize game
I'm a lay mine's down

I'm a big girl I can handle myself
But if I get lonely I may need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else.

Baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go

Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And its you that I want
Promiscuous boy
I'm calling your name
But you're driving me crazy
The way you're making me wait Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need
Promiscuous boy
We're one in the same
So we don't gotta play games no more
