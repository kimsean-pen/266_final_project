Do you know what it's like?
Come on, come on

Baby tell me
Do I look like the kind of girl
That you want to take home
Want to make me your own
Do you even know what I like
Just what I'm living for
What I adore

Baby, take the time to realize I'm
Not the kind to sacrifice
The way I am
So if you want to be my man (baby)

Walk a mile in my shoes
Do me right or I'm through
Can't you see that
If you want to stay around (I'm telling you)
You've got to figure me out
Take your time or you lose
This is my game, my rules
And I can see, obviously
Baby you don't know
What it's like to be me

Do you know what it's like?
Do you know what it's like?

Don't you get it twisted boy
I want you too
But you got my heart to win
Before I let you in
And this deceives you baby
I'm not the average lady
I need someone to love

Baby, take the time to realize I'm
Not the kind to sacrifice
The way I am
So if you want to be my man (baby)

Walk a mile in my shoes
Do me right or I'm through
Can't you see that
If you want to stay around (I'm telling you)
You've got to figure me out
Take your time or you lose
This is my game, my rules
And I can see, obviously
Baby you don't know
What it's like to be me

Baby, get to know me
Then you can show me
That you love for me is true
I'll give you everything
That a girl can give
Don't you want to be my man?

Walk a mile in my shoes
