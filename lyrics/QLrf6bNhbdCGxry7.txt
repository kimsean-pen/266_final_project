Lost in a valley of smoke,
I lose sight of those I love.
I cant live in this dream,
wandering the world a lost soul.
A shell of a man,
frozen in a toxic trance.
A shell of a man,
frozen in a toxic trance.

Unfamiliar reflections stare at me,
these eyes are not my own.
Running from my demons in this endless valley.
Show me the way,
because I no longer know right from wrong.

I know what has to be done,
the smoke will settle
the demons will come
and I will be torn apart.
Exposing my weakness the world will see,
what I never f*cking wanted.

As I stare at your face,
soaked in disgrace,
what is the price a judgment of life,
I cry out in this dispossession.

Exposing my weakness
the world will see what I never,
what I never, what I never f*cking wanted.
They crowd around me,
here to take their share of my mind.

I can no longer muster
the strength to face them alone, all on my own.
They whisper echoes in unknown tongues,
I refuse to absorb their toxic words.

I've forgotten how to love,
searching behind locked doors in my mind.
Cast aside the fear of reality,
face the f*cking world.
