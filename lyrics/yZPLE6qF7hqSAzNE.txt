I masturbated to the songs you wrote
Resuscitated all of my hopes
It felt wrong but it didn't take too long
Much appreciated are your songs.

Doesn't mean I like you man
It just helps me get to sleep
And it's cheaper than Temazepam.

I under-estimated your intelligence
A little bit of weed mixed with some sentiment
Over-rated films marked 'XXX'
Come on play it with some tenderness.
