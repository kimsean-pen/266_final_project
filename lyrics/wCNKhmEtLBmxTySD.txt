Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell Rock
Jingle bell swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell Rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the block
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling street
That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell Rock
La da da da, da da da da da, da da
Yeah
Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell Rock
La da da da, da da da da da, da da

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away (To rock the night away)
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the block
Mix and a-mingle in this jingling street
That's the Jingle Bell (That's the Jingle Bell)
That's the Jingle Bell (Jingle Bell)
That's the Jingle Bell Rock, yeah
That's the Jingle Bell Rock (Rock)
