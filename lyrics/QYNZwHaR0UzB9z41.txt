I need this like air in my lungs
This element tears through my bones
It keeps me fighting
Well I, emotions that swim through my veins
A fever that shows in my face
I'm not hiding
And this fire is alive in your eyes

Well I can barely breathe
And I can hear the dark hearts marching
I won't go down easily
Stay here by my side
And we will be the last ones standing
Hold my hand and kiss me before the hearts collide

Cold, the feeling of fear on my skin

Dying to find a way in the silver lining
The stars, they burn out like dreams all around
Falling like rain to the ground
But you're still shining
And this fire is alive in your eyes

Well I can barely breathe
And I can hear the dark hearts marching
I won't go down easily
Stay here by my side
And we will be the last ones standing
Hold my hand and kiss me before the hearts collide

Don't wake me up
I feel your touch
Your love like blood runs through me
You consume me

Well I can barely breathe
And I can hear the dark hearts marching
I won't go down easily
Stay here by my side
And we will be the last ones standing
Hold my hand and kiss me before the hearts collide
