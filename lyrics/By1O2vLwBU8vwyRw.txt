I've been walking for so long
Just enough for the love I want
Watching from the sidelines
Living through signs that it's alright

'Cause I will flow through the night time
And I get lost in the daylight
But I can't follow to meet you
Far away, where I'm
Out on the other side

You're just alone, wo-o-o-o-o-o-ah
Wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh
You're just you, wo-o-o-o-o-o-ah
Fucking that up, woah

Are you with me
Are you with me

I can feel your heart beating soft now
Just telling me that I'll be fine
When you're gone I will never know
So tell where the love goes

'Cause I will flow through the night time
And I get lost in the daylight
But I can't follow to meet you
Far away, where I'm
Out on the other side

You're just alone, wo-o-o-o-o-o-ah
Wo-o-o-o-o-o-ah
You're just you, wo-o-o-o-o-o-ah
Fucking that up, woah
You're just you, wooo
Fucking that up, woah

Do you...
