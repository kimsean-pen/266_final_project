take me out
outside the house with you
make me feel whole, or warmth, or mildly amused
and i can't recall ever feeling love so true
hold onto my hand, hold me close, i got nothing to lose
the sad songs make me sadder as they're floating through the air
i just wanna feel your love but i know it's not fair
would you bring me flowers and run your fingers through my hair
yeah lets turn the lights out darling i just couldn't bear to sleep alone
to sleep alone
your eyes exploding into me with every little line
you think that you could be the one
you think that you could be mine
and i can't recall every feeling love so fine
i feel it in the way you yearn, the way you long, the way you pine
struggling to get out all the thoughts inside my head
but your puppy dog glances make me wanna cry instead
i could keep you company in your town, in your bed
so let's turn the lights out darling i just wasn't bred to sleep alone
to sleep alone
