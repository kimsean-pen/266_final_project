She can do anything at all
Have anything she pleases
Power to change what she thinks is wrong
So what could she want with me?
Yeah

Wait just one minute here
I can see that she's trying to read me
Suddenly I know

She's going to change the world
She's going to change the world
She's going to change the world
But she can't change me
No she can't change me

She has the daylight at her command
She gives the night its dreams yeah
She can uncover your darkest fear
Make you forget you feel it

Wait just one minute more
I can see that she's trying to free me
Suddenly I know

She's going to change the world
She's going to change the world
She's going to change the world
But she can't change me
No she can't change me

And Suddenly I can see everything
That's wrong with me yeah
But what can I do?
I'm the only thing I really have at all

But wait just one minute here
I can see that she's trying to need me
Suddenly I know

She's going to change the world
She's going to change the world
She's going to change the world
But she can't change me
No she can't change me
