When the sun comes down
When the rain wash away
All the hopes I can bring
To another day
Another day

When your trees start to sway
And the wind makes them move

I can tell that
You don't know

To all the fights I've conquered and behold
The times have changed and I will now move over slowly...
Buy through it all I still feel lost without you
Hard to find a new soul
The silence takes its toll

Just sway
You don't know...
Just sway
You don't know...
Just sway
And all you want is to find home...

Theres a light pausing
Feel the volume of the sky
Mark your place in time with another question why...

Time flickers in the night
Always lookin to be right

To all the fights I've conquered and behold
The times have changed and I will now move over slowly...
Buy through it all I still feel lost without you
Hard to find a new soul
The silence takes its toll

You don't know
Just sway
You don't know
Just sway
And all you want is to find home...
Just sway
And you don't love
Just sway
And you don't know
Just sway
And all you want is to find home...

Ooooh ooooh ooooh ooooh
Just sway
Just sway
