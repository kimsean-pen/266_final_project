Now you say you're lonely
Said you cry the whole night through
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river

'Cause I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
So what?
Just cry me a river, cry me a river

I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian

Told me you were through with me
And now you say you love me
Well, just prove you do
Go on and cry me a river, I'd like to see you cry me a river

'Cause I'm tired crying over you
