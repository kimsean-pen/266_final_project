I want a dog, a Chihuahua
When I get back to my small flat
I want to hear somebody bark
Oh, you can get lonely
I want a dog

Don't want a cat
scratching its claws all over my habitat
giving no love and getting fat
Oh, you can get lonely
and a cat's no help with that

Bulldog, hound and pug and labrador
Collie, retriever and Doberman pincher
Husky, Dalmatian, Saint Bernard und Dachshund
Mongrel, beagle, Cocker spaniel

I want a dog
to walk in the park
When it gets dark
my dog will bark at any passers-by
Oh, you can get lonely
I want a dog

I want a dog, a Chihuahua
When I get back to my small flat
I want to hear somebody bark
Oh, you can get lonely
