Ten, nine, eight, seven, six
Five, four, three, two, one, yay!

Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop talkin' shit and give us more, more
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop talkin' shit and give us more, more
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop talkin' shit and give us more, more
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop talkin' shit and give us more, more, more

Kiss the shoulder, hop in the Corolla
These bitches talkin' shit like the bottom of porta-potties
Bright ass yellow teeth, you a shit talker, gossip
Legs movin' like a salsa dancer
Drunk, fallin' out ya car like a flaccid dick
Aww, man, god damn, what the fuck wrong with ya?
Say it to my face, pussy ass boy
Need a Altoid for your hot breath, life a hot mess
Pop your biceps, cue the roid rage

I think I got like five more albums inside my mind
This that shit, that do or die, make your grandmama cry
Keep some baggy jeans on me, keep a Billie Jean on me
Got that New Orleans on me, smellin' like a queen to ya

Cu–cu–cucumber lemonade, I need somethin' fresh today
Barber make the texture fade, actin' out like it's charades
Strawberry sweater fleece, baby, give me somethin' sweet
We don't gotta be discreet, moonwalkin' between the seats

Hit on that beat and then stop (Ahh!)
Hop on that booty like who the hell cutie
Like I don't know cootie, my momma ain't raise no bitch ass
Ain't no kiss ass, ain't no–
Get the fuck out of my face now
Get the fuck out of my way now
You are so far off my level; Stop!

In the barber shop with my niggas, ay
I ain't never soft for my nigga, ay
I ain't never copy no nigga, ay
So quit talkin', bitch nigga, (Quit yo talkin', bitch) ay
Ay, I wanna buy a Jeep, ay, that's my energy
Trilogy, that's history, Southside, baby, rest in peace!

Uh, lordy, lordy, testify, yeah
Got explosives in my mind, yeah
Search for feelin's I can't find, yeah
I'm a ghost because I grind, yeah
Made a deal with Father Time, yeah
Told me "Find a way to shine," yeah
"I can make you live forever"
"All you gotta do is dance until you die," yeah

Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop talkin' shit and give us more, more
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop talkin' shit and give us more, more
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
