Think of all the things we've done and now,
you've decided I'm not the one.
A love like ours just can't go on,
run away baby have your fun but.

I, I, I, I, don't wanna hurt you I don't wanna see you cry.
I, I, I, I, just wanna hold you love tonight.
You owe me some kind of love.

I don't wanna see you sad I don't want you,
feeling down I only want you to say you love me and you need me,
the way I love ya please believe me.

I, I, I, I, don't wanna hurt you I don't wanna see you cry.
I, I, I, I, just wanna hold you love tonight.
You owe me some kind of love.
You owe me some kind of love.

Think of all the things we've done and now,
you've decided I'm not the one.
A love like ours just can't go on,
run away baby have your fun but.

I, I, I, I, don't wanna hurt you I don't wanna see you cry
. I, I, I, I, just want you back I don't want to fight.
I, I, I, I, just wanna hold you love tonight.
You owe me some kind of love.
You owe me some kind of love. Help!
