Your love's impossible
You need too much to just survive
Get enough and you're gonna fly

We're in the rhythm
The groove's forgiven
There's no mistake in
My optimism
There's nothing hidden
Nothing's forbidden
The beat is driven

We got the feeling
We're operating
Don't need no healing
At least I'm breathing
I'm estimating
I'll up the rating
Loves for the taking

Baby won't you slide with me
Stay close by with me
Baby you can fly with me
It could be so good
If only you can see that

Chorus:
Your love's impossible
You need too much to just survive
Get enough and you're gonna fly
(Impossible, illogical, illogical, impossible)
Your love's illogical
With just one touch you run and hide
Take your chances and take a ride
(Impossible, illogical, illogical, impossible)

You got me vibing
So high we're riding
Don't stop this feeling
The Sun is shining
It's no surprising
My sign is rising
Just keep on movin'

Baby won't you slide with me
Stay close by with me
Baby you can fly with me
It could be so good
If only you can see that

Chorus

Illogical, impossible to love
(Impossible, impossible to love)
Impossible, illogical to love
Impossible, illogical to love
Impossible, impossible, illogical to love
Impossible, illogical to love

Chorus x2
(Baby won't you slide with me
Stay close by with me
Baby you can fly with me
You can fly with me)

Chorus
