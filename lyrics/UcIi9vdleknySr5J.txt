You've been told that I'm the devil
But my blood is your blood
In shame my, my blood stains your hands
You are the murderer of my fire and my sense

You threw me away
What should I do now
Black halo is given to me
You close your eyes
Now when I need you
This black halo will burn me alive
Burn me alive

You called me, you called me a sinner
You still talk forgiveness
But now your dreams are haunted by your guilt

You threw me away
What should I do now
Black halo is given to me
You close your eyes
Now when I need you
This black halo will burn me alive
Burn me alive

Tie the bind
Here forever we're entwined in dark and light
In shame my blood stains your hands
In shame my blood stains your hands

You threw me away
What should I do now
Black halo is given to me
You close your eyes
Now when I need you
This black halo will burn me alive
Burn me alive

The the bind
Here forever we're entwined and I will find you
Like they'll never ever find the way to heaven's light
