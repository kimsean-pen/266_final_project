Delilah, Delilah

Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my
You're irresistible, ooh, ooh, ooh
You make me smile when I'm just about to cry
You bring me hope, you make me laugh, and I like it
You get away with murder so innocent
But when you throw a moody
You're all claws and you bite
That's alright

Delilah, Delilah
Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my
You're unpredictable, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You make me so very happy
When you cuddle up and go to sleep beside me
And then you make me slightly mad
When you pee all over my Chippendale suite

Ooh, ooh (Delilah)
Ooh, ooh (Delilah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You take over my house and home
You even try to answer my telephone
Delilah, you're the apple of my eye

Meow, meow, meow
Delilah, I love you, Delilah, oh
Ooh, you make me so very happy
You give me kisses and I go out of my mind, ooh
You're irresistible, I love you, Delilah
Delilah, I love you
Ha, ha
You make me very happy, ooh, oh, yeah
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your, your, your kisses
I love your kisses
