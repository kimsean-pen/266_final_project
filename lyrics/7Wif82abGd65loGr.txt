You answer to me

I am the thunder and the rain, the confusion and the pain
And when I leave, I will wash your wounds clean and leave them golden
I got the whole world swinging from the end of my chain
And I'm calling
I got your life in my hands and every debt will be paid
And I'm calling

Between the spark and the ember
You are smoke threading the wind

In time, all will return to me
In time, all find an end
You answer to me

I am the fight and the fury, gravity in all its glory
And when I come around, I bring the hammer of god down upon you
I got the whole world swinging from the end of my chain
And I'm calling
I got your life in my hands and every debt will be paid
And I'm calling, stop

Between the spark and the ember
You are smoke threading the wind

In time, all will return to me
In time, all find an end
In time, all will return to me
In time, you'll find no other way
You answer to me

I am the end and the beginning
I am the end and the beginning
I am forever
I am eternal and nothing stands against me
You answer to me
You answer to me
You answer to me
