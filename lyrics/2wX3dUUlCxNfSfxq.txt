I want a goth babe in my life
I want someone I can bite
I want to listen to the cure
I want to tell you that I'm yours

We can shoegaze in my room
So we can sing about our gloom
I want to feel you in my soul
If you feel the way I do
If you feel the way I do
If you feel the way I do
If you feel the way I do

I want a goth babe in my head
A girl dressed in black in red
To do a seance in my bed
And then we'll fuck till we're both dead

Candle wax dropped on my nips
While we worship Robert Smith
I want to feel you in my soul
If you feel the way I do
If you feel the way I do
If you feel the way I do
If you feel the way I do
