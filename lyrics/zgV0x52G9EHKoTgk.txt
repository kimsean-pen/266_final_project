It's time for a fight
Now they're drawing their lines
And you know it's not right
When you're stuck picking sides
(It's the invisible enemy)

If I can't see it, then how can I believe it?
Tell me how will you live
(How will you live, how will you live)
If you hide what eats you alive when no one sees you
Tell me how will you live
(How will you live, how will you live)
(How will you live, how will you live)
(How will you live, how will you live)

It's time for a fight
Between the heart and the mind
And you know it's not right
When you're stuck picking sides
(It's the invisible enemy)

If I can't see it, then how can I believe it?
Tell me how will you live
(How will you live, how will you live)
If you hide what eats you alive when no one sees you
Tell me how will you live
(How will you live, how will you live)

When fear and pain suffocate
Tell me how will you live
Will you disclose or will you break?
Tell me how will you live
How will you live?
How will you live?
How will you live?

If I can't see it, then how can I believe it?
Tell me how will you live
(How will you live, how will you live)
If you hide what eats you alive when no one sees you
Tell me how will you live
(How will you live, how will you live)
(How will you live, how will you live)
(How will you live)
If you hide what eats you alive when no one sees you
Tell me how will you live
(How will you live, how will you live)
(How will you live, how will you live)
(How will you live, how will you live)
