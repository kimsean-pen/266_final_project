Spread the news don't you feel much better
The cenacles are afraid to die
What's the truth but an open letter
By the clowns soaked in pesticide

Realize
You're gonna pay the price
You're gonna pay tonight

Some don't but to have is better
I got lost there along the way
I don't care for the change in weather
I let go to come back again
Realize
I'm guilty in my ways

Heard the news and it ain't much better
The innocent try to stay alive
Every time there's a real go getter
Falling down in the well that's dry

Realize
You're gonna pay the price
You're gonna pay tonight

Some don't but to have is better
I got lost there along the way
I don't care for the change in weather
I let go to come back again

Realize
I'm guilty in my ways

Some don't but to have is better
I got lost there along the way
I don't care for the change in weather
I let go to come back again

Realize
I'm guilty in my ways

Realize
I'm guilty in my ways
