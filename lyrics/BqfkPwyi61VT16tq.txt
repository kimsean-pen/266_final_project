And every time I talk to you
The world around us blurs out of view
I can't hear a word you say
I'm lost between the lines upon your face
If I changed for you
Then would you change too?

But we'll connect eventually
If you stay you and I change me
This is the distance between you and me
Even though at the end of the day
We'll smash it down again
And build it the all same
This is the distance between you and me

I would risk all the rejection
For a shot at some affection from you
There's not many I can't handle
But they didn't write one when it came to you

If I changed for you
Then would you change too?
If I changed for you
Then would you change too?

But we'll connect eventually
If you stay you and I change me
This is the distance between you and me
Even though at the end of the day
We'll smash it down again
And build it the all same
This is the distance between you and me

Baby, tessellate
I wanna connect with you
If it ain't too late
Baby, would you tessellate?

If I changed for you
Then would you change too?
If I changed for you
Then would you change too?

But we'll connect eventually
If you stay you, and I change me
This is the distance between you and me
Even though at the end of the day
We'll smash it down again
And build it the all same
This is the distance between you and me

If I changed for you
Then would you change too?
This is the distance between you and me
If I changed for you
Then would you change too?
This is the distance between you and me

Baby, tessellate
I wanna connect with you
If it ain't too late
Baby, would you tessellate?
