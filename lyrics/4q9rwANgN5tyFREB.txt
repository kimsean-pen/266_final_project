I need a challengd
Don't let me have it
Show me your talent
Give me a challenge

Silk on my body
No one on my mind
Platinum dreams end in single nights
When did I get so unimpressed
(Unimpressed)
Pick me up and put me on your chesr
(Do ya best yeah)
I left my feelings on the floor

This game is too predictable
Ima watch you eat it up

Man i've had it
I'm dramatic
Tell me what did you expect?
I'm the baddest bad habit
Yeah yeah
Je garde mon coeur pour quelqu'un qui n'a pas peur
C'est pas comme si je pleure tous les soirs toute seule

I left my feelings on the floor
Now I can tell you want me more
This game is too predictable
Ima watch you eat it up

Don't let me have it.

It's never enough
It's never enough for me

Ima do it for the rush (I need a challenge)
Ima watch you eat it up (Don't let me have it)
