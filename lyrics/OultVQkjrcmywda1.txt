Why'd you tell me this
Were you looking for my reaction
What do you need to know?
Don't you know i'll always be your girl
You don't have to prove to me your beautiful to strangers
I've got lovin' eyes of my own

You belong to me
Tell her, tell her you were fooling
You belong to me
You don't even know her
You belong to me
Tell her that I love you
You belong to me

You belong to me
Can it be hunny, that your not sure
You belong to me
Thought we'd close the book and lock the door
You don't have to prove to me your beautiful to strangers
I've got lovin' eyes of my own, of my own
And I can tell, I can tell, darling

You belong to me
Tell her, tell her that I love you
You belong to me
You belong, you belong, you belong to me
You belong to me
Tell her you were fooling
You belong to me
Tell her she don't even know you

Tell her
You belong to me
Tell her, you were fooling
You belong to me
I've know you from time ago baby
You belong to me
Don't make me go to her house
You belong to me
You belong, you belong, you belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
(You belong to me)
