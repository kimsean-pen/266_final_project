Here I stand, all alone
Trying to fight the pain from a broken heart
Why she left me? I don't know
It really doesn't matter anymore
I thought that love could last forever
But here I stand lost and all alone

Start a new day, but not alone
I'm gonna break away from this broken heart
I'll meet a woman. I'm gonna take her home
Where I'll pick all the pieces and start all over again

I know that life will be much better
Cause I know the light will shine again

There is life even after a broken heart, broken heart
You can fight the pain from a broken heart broken heart

I know that life will be much better
Cause I know the light will shine again

There is life even after a broken heart, broken heart
You can fight the pain from a broken heart broken heart

There is life even after a broken heart, broken heart
You can fight the pain from a broken heart broken heart
