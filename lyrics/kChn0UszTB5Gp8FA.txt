It was taking too long, high five Hong Kong
I shouldn't confront them well
It was taking too long, it was taking too long

I was saying goodbye boom boom Shanghai
Wohhoy, I shouldn't confront them well
I was saying goodbye, I was saying goodbye

It feels so wrong
It feels so wrong
It feels so wrong
Because

I don't want, I don't want, I don't want to be in Helsinki art scene
I don't want, I don't want, I don't want to be in
I don't want, I don't want, I don't want to be in Helsinki art scene
I don't need, I don't need, I don't need to be in Helsinki art scene

It was taking too long, high five Hong Kong
I shouldn't confront them well
It was taking too long, it was taking too long

I was saying goodbye boom boom Shanghai
Wohhoy, I shouldn't confront them well
I was saying goodbye, I was saying goodbye

It feels so wrong
It feels so wrong
It feels so wrong
Because

I don't want, I don't want, I don't want to be in Helsinki art scene
I don't want, I don't want, I don't want to be in
I don't want, I don't want, I don't want to be in Helsinki art scene
I don't need, I don't need, I don't need to be in Helsinki art scene

I don't want, I don't want, I don't want to be in
I don't need, I don't need, I don't need to be in
I don't want, I don't want, I don't want to be in
I don't need, I don't need, I don't need to be in

I don't want, I don't want, I don't want to be in Helsinki art scene
I don't want, I don't want, I don't want to be in
I don't want, I don't want, I don't want to be in Helsinki art scene
I don't need, I don't need, I don't need to be in
