Hunting a demon I've seen
Fishing out her fair behind the screen
Hunted by a dusty cypher, magnetism my own rifle
And the sickest police gave me perfect marks at the sycophantic academy

Hey, you pray, I still got plasma coming through better than you

Do what they trained me to do? sweating?? show how I wanted you like a ghost wants revenge
I'm not living

This is how the pros do it right
Wedding chapel exorcism under a dim ray of life
Kids keep writing specter stories just to get each other horny
Inside their marrow intents
Hiding from the witch I'm stalking through the dark forest
