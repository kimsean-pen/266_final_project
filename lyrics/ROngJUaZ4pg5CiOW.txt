You once were someone I could dignify
A guiding force in which I thought I could rely
I watched as you began to metamorphosize
Can't face it anymore
It's eating me alive
I'm not able to recognize
Where does the aswer lie?
You're no longer the same
Is there nothing more that I can do?

Who

The hell are you?

Who
The fuck are you?

You were someone in whom I could confide
You pushed me further away with every single lie
You used to have a soul but then it surely died
What happened, when did you turn to the other side?

No longer able to recognize
For every word's a lie
You are forever changed and
There is nothing more left I can do

Who!
You and I
We were were once so
You and I
It was once incredible
You and I
We were once so
You and I
We were indivisible
You and I
We were once two of a kind
Where did all your innocence go?

Now I wonder how it happened that
You and I
We were once so
You and I
We were once inseparable
You and I
We were once like Gemini
It was undeniable
You and I
We were once two of a kind
Where did my deliverance go?
Can there be an end to this divide?

I'm no longer able to recognize
Where does the aswer lie?
You are no longer the same
Is there nothing more left I can do?
