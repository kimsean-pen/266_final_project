I heard lightning strike
I saw bodies moving
I took up the fight into valleys glooming

I have caught them all
Every glimpse of failure
Why do you still call and question my behaviour?

I heard lightning strike
I saw bodies moving
I will move if my strings would start approving

She must find another home
But she won't leave a man of silence

Hear these voices hear the cheers of choices
There are colors following your kind
Don't you dare forget the purple water shining
You've been dressed in disaster and turned every brick that your head will combine
Now why are you still trapped in mazes you designed?
