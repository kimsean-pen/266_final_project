Don't think I didn't see how you looked at me
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
I've spent those sleepless nights
And I'm waiting for
And I'm waiting for you

Sometimes I'd rather lie...

Oh, we found love
It takes me farther than I've ever known
I thought you'd take a shot on us
You're my only one, still be mine
And I'll see you on the outside
(see you on the outside)

I never fall asleep I always fall apart when you gone
I'm hopeless at best on my own
And I wish that I could close my eyes, pretend that you'd be by my side
Cause all I wanted was a face to call my own
All I needed was a place that feels like home
I think I'm falling for you (falling for you)

Oh, we found love
It takes me farther than I've ever known
I thought you'd take a shot on us
You're my only one, still be mine
And I'll see you on the outside

Let's make our way out of town
This place has fallen apart
No one knows you like I do

Let's make our way out of town
This place has fallen apart
No one knows you like I do

Let's leave it all far behind
We'll make it out of here alive
Let's leave it all far behind
No one knows you like I do

Sometimes I'd rather lie

(we found love)
(takes me father than I ever knew)

Oh, we found love
It takes me farther than I've ever known
I thought you'd take a shot on us
You're my only one, still be mine
And I'll see you on the outside
Oh, I'll see you on the outside
Oh, I'll see you on the outside
