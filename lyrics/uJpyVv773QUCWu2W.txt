Freddie, I know
When your time comes it won't be pretty, no
You reap what you sow
You and your friends
The trojan horse you came in left a stench
A carcass in the trench

Freddie, one day
All of the workers that you led astray
Will make you pay
Oh Freddie, you should know
Can't punish people cause your hair won't grow
It's alright, just let go

Freddie, I know
You waved a banner at our latest show
How so?
And why not the expected slander?
You made me feel like Zarah Leander

Just let us go
