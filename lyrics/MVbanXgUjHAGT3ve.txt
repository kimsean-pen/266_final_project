Come the summer, come the spring
Come the lonely part of me
It was all in my head
To remember it
when you came and said to me
In my heart you'll always be
Well I thought you were mine
But now I know

In time the light will come and seek me out
To draw my heart out from my mouth
and prey on words I'll never say

and in time the shadows form to feed the dark
to hide the beat of heavy hearts
so in the night I'll always stay

Come and toll your bells for me
Ringing out in rounds across the empty heart of mine
To break the silence in the night
In darkness you
come and sing your songs to me
Spin me round and watch me fall to pieces over you
Yet you haven't a clue
Well I'm sure that

In time the light will come and seek me out
To draw my heart out from my mouth
and prey on words I'll never say

and in time the shadows form to feed the dark
so in the night I'll always stay

A cowering fall, a coward is all that I'll be
(See the sun, feel the sun)

But no will of mine could stop the dawning day
Could hide the sun so I must say
for you, my love will stay
