We're the little creatures deep inside your mind
Some call us their fantasy but some to never find
We can teach philosophy but still we must commend
The state of our existence right into your hand
Welcome to this place in here come overstep all your fears

Where have you all been once
When I was alone?
When I was a hero in their crazy wicked show
You've sent no little spark into my darkened view of life
Did not make me ask for what is wrong and what is right

And still I regret to be here
I'm dreaming of Anna in tears

Inside, so deep inside
You will die if I don't dream anymore?
Inside, so deep inside
You will die if I don't dream anymore?

Inside, so deep inside
You will die if I don't dream anymore?
Inside, so deep inside
You will die if I don't dream anymore?
Dream anymore
