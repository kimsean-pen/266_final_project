I just need you absolutely
All the tears in your mind
I just want you absolutely
To sail this ship of mine

I don't know what the hell you're saying
'Cause you're going blind
Using all the lies they taught you
To hurt your mind
Your mind
Your mind

And I, I can breathe now
I can breathe now
Now
Now

It's there, pretends to be a guide for you
Like a candle in the dark
Lies like a really cold breeze in, the air
Step by step you'll lose your faith

I just need you miserably
Broken man come to me
I just need you desperately
Just want to change your mind

I don't know what the hell you're saying
'Cause you're going blind
Using all the lies they taught you
To hurt your mind
Your mind
Your mind

And I, I can breathe now
I can breathe now
Now
Now

I just need you miserably
I just need you desperately
I just want you absolutely
To sail this ship of mine

And I, I can breathe now
I can breathe now
Now
Now
