I wonder, wandering all around this big place I live
She was scared to go outside
Where it once felt so nice to me

Picked up your smoke, then you drag a little
I wanna choke, so you won't belittle
Everyone knows that you'll do it
Over and over and over and over again

You're pretty, won't you come play with me
This time I'll be nice
You can't trust what I say to you
I know they're all lies
Do you?

And if you ever had to
I would be going strong
What in the world was happening
Dear, can I be wrong?

Picked up your smoke, then you drag a little
I wanna choke, so you won't belittle
Everyone knows that you'll do it
Over and over and over and over again
