Drop dead he said this feels so liberating, take my love and run
Never been fond of instigating, take my love
Oh you took my love and then you left, called it your own
Yeah you took my love, of course you left, I should have known
Drop dead he said this feels so liberating (take my love and run)
I've never been fond of instigating

Oh, take my love and run and no I won't come back
Yeah, take my love and run and no I won't come back

Grab my bag and bring me into the ocean, take my love and run
The tide rolls in void of all emotion, take my love
Oh, break my heart, disintegrated what would be
Yeah, take my love, you might as well listen to me
Drop dead he said this feels so liberating (take my love and run)
The tide rolls in void of all emotion

Oh, take my love and run and no I won't come back
Yeah, take my love and run and no I won't come back
Oh, take my love and run and no I won't come back
Yeah, take my love and run and no I won't come back

Drop dead he said this feels so liberating
The tide rolls in void of all emotion

Oh, take my love and run and no I won't come back
Yeah, take my love and run and no I won't come back
Oh, take my love and run and no I won't come back
Yeah, take my love and run and no I won't come back

You took my, you took my, I won't come back
