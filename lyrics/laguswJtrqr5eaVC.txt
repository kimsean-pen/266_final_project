Pass the menu for my mind must pick the food to feed a fool,
You're a different kind of decoration 'cause you wear the room
Bang Bang
Oh yeah, I looked across the room and you were looking back at me
I pay with heart instead of money and my weakness was the tip
Bang Bang
Bang Bang
Bang Bang
When I looked across the room and you were staring straight at me
I spilt some coffee yea to show ya, you're beautiful you see
Bang Bang
In your eyes there was an honesty, no lies, but you werent free
I forgot to place an order 'cause those colours consumed me
Bang Bang
Bang Bang Bang
Bang Bang Bang
Could I take your eyes off that plate for awhile?
I can't take my eyes off of you, please be mine.
She only held it for a moment; optimism not my friend,
A cup of Beam, anything, shook my beer out the end
Bang Bang
I only held it for a moment; bosses never let you be,
If I could hold time for an instant, I would gladly set you free
Bang Bang
Bang Bang
Could I take your eyes off that plate for awhile?
I can't take my eyes off of you please be mine.
Bang Bang
Bang Bang
Under? orange lights we both approached eyes as if to greet
Sharing shy smiles we thought then walked on by never again to meet
Bang Bang
Bang Bang
Bang Bang
Bang Bang
Bang Bang
I can't wipe the smile off my face, please be mine.
