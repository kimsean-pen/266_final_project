It's interesting, we ought to know, originally we all came from,
A place to test the nest beyond, to Megumi the milkyway,
Like sharks that wear the knife edge stone, to pull the fish to catch the wind,
Forever be good, no love making it all, with Megumi the milkyway above
At three years old, the curly head, with teeth that grow before his hair,
A spotty nose, he loves his voice, unlike Megum has done instead,
Leave the boy that traveled on, with neo-blossom and harnessed his boys,
They came to stay and there they were, I don't believe in what we saw
Forever be afar from here, when we receive before too long,
From scratching heads, the flame grows strong, with Megumi the milkyway above
