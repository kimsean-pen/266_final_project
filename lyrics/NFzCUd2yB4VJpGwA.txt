inside your house
weve got a lot to talk about
decorations that we found
instead we look around
instead we look around
i dont mind
it happens all the time
dont decide
it happens all the time
inside your car
we never have to drive too far
i like the freckles on your arm
not eat with you id rather starve
inside your house
your mom puts on her favorite blouse
we pass the dishes all around
i hope they like me now
i hope they like me now
you remind me of better times
dusty blinds
this happens all the time
