i live behind the perfect mask
erase the rule forever

i live behind the perfect mask
unleash the truth forever

i live behind the perfect mask
too late gonna live at last

i live behind the perfect mask
too late gonna live at last

i live behind the perfect mask
erase the truth forever

i live behind the perfect mask
only the true endevour

help me... i dare say theres no other way
help me... i dare say theres no other way to go

wanton fallacy again
merciless until the end
recognise my heart is there
so reveal me and disgrace me
