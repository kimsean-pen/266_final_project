March of the black
Dungeoned ones
Beyond the dim
They shape

March of the black
Dungeoned ones
Beyond the dim
They lurk

March of the black
Awakened beasts
Beyond the dim
They rage

Hordes of evil march
Until the end you fall
Drawn to the apocalypse
It is the age of ending

Damned in black

The ghastly rivers whirl
Swallowing all in sight
Come the vision we await
Into the blinding depths
And never to return...

Damned in black

March of the black
Dungeoned ones
Beyond the dim
They shape

March of the brave
Immortal gods
From beyond the dim
We rise...
