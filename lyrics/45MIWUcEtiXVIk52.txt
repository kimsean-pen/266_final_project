Time keeps painting my darling
Ripped all the flowers in the garden
Oh baby, come home
You angels, bring her home
Imens står solen over højen
Han mindes den sommer hvor hun strålede
Forsvandt i haven grøn
Og træernes sang hun fandt

Time keeps painting my darling
And the garden keeps on singing the old song
Oh baby, still I am waiting in the light
Hoping the angels would carry you home
Den sang tog mørket i sin pote
Den bar hans kvinde i dens kolde favn
Og lagde hende for hans dør i silke kjole
Hoping the angels would carry her home

Leaving it all with my only friend
Her beauty was lifeless on the stair
Oh baby, I'll carry you away
Into the garden's tale
But everything (had) died and turned to stones
I laid her down under the old oak
Seeing it all blossom forever more

Time keeps on painting my darling
And the garden keeps on singing the old song
Oh baby, now I know you're in the light
Painting it all with your colourful songs
Imens står solen over højen
Hans skygge kastes ud i haven grøn
Forsvandt for evigt og uden en note
Hoping the angels will carry him home

Leaving it all with my only friend
Her beauty was lifeless on the stair
Oh baby, I'll carry you away
Into the garden's tale
But everything (had) died and turned to stones
I laid her down under the old oak
Seeing it all blossom forever more

Time keeps painting my darling
Ripped all the flowers in the garden
Oh baby, you're home
You angels, where are you?
