I watched the words drip from you
And pour from your mouth like a sieve
I'll end like I did begin
Jump rope the stars in a game
But you were there too
We spit from the moon
And found their heads down below
I can't make no sense of this
I can't make no sense of this at all
Sad inconsistencies we see
When you find yourself lonely
But right next to me
Well I was there too
Just as lonely as you
But we found their heads down below
I can't make no sense of this
I can't make no sense of this at all
So what's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?
And when the summer ends, yeah
I'll be there hiding
And when the sun rises, yeah
I'll stay warm forever
Many have come before, many have been
Where will we be, when will it end?
Many have come before many have been
Where will we be?
We were there too
We spit from the moon
And found their heads down below
I can't make no sense of this
I can't make no sense of this at all
So what's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do?
And when the summer ends, yeah
I'll be there hiding
And when the sun rises, yeah
I'll stay warm forever
And when the summer ends, yeah
I'll be there hiding
And when the sun rises, yeah
I'll stay warm forever
And when the summer ends, yeah
I'll stay warm
