My heart beats a little bit slower
These nights are a little bit colder
Now that you're gone
My sky seem a little bit darker
Sweet dreams come a little bit harder
I hate when you're gone

Everyday time's passing growing tired of all this traffic
Take me away to where you are
I wanna be holding your hand in the sand by the tire swing

Where we used to be Baby
you and me
I travelled a thousand miles so just I can see you smile
Feel so far away when you cry, 'cause home is in your eyes
Your heart beats a little bit faster

There's tears were there used to be laughter
Now that I'm gone
You talk just a little bit softer
Things take just a little bit longer, you hate that I'm gone

Everyday time's passing growing tired of all this traffic
Take me away to where you are
I wanna be holding your hand in the sand by the tire swing
Where we used to be Baby
You and me
I travelled a thousand miles so just I can see you smile

Feel so far away when you cry, cause home is in your eyes
If I could write another ending
This wouldn't even be our song

I'd find a way that we would never ever be apart
Right from the start
I wanna be holding your hand in the sand by the tire swing
Where we used to be Baby
You and me

I travelled a thousand miles so just I can see you smile
Feel so far away when you cry, 'cause home is in your eyes
I wanna be holding your hand in the sand by the tire swing
Where we used to be, baby; you and me.
I travelled a thousand miles so just I can see you smile
Feel so far away when you cry
'Cause home is in your eyes
