Show up on your front lawn
High and with my jeans torn up
We both know that this is wrong
Boy, right now, you're all I want

Only you can make me feel like this
Feeling on your fingertips
Explosions when our worlds collide
Something that we can't deny

There's something about us
(Us, us)

Something that we can't deny

Us, us

Something that we can't deny

Leave the bottle by the door
Take off all that you have on
We know what I came here for
In the morning, I'll be gone

Only you can make me feel like this
Feeling on your fingertips
Explosions when our worlds collide
Something that we can't deny

There's something about us
(Us, us)

Something that we can't deny
There's something about us
There's something about us
(I can feel your touch)
Something that we can't deny
Us, us

There's something about us
Us, us
Something that we can't deny
Us, us
There's something about us
Us, us
Something that we can't deny
