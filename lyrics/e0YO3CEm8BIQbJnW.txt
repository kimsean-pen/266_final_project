no god will ever safe you.
you gonna be forced to safe yourself
you cut a wound, that won't close anymore
i whish i could but i can never forget
only your pain can relief mine
time will tell,
i will never forget

forgiveness!
forgiveness!
forgiveness!
denied!

it's all fun till it's not funny anymore
always ready you say till the day
you've not been ready for
the moment of truth you
do you realize the fact,
that life's not in your hands anymore

your prayers won't be heard
waste of time speaking out those words
there is no god!
no god
no god
no god
the remembering are the living
your sins stay sins and
you won't be forgiven
you fucked it up

forgiveness!
forgiveness!
forgiveness!
denied!
