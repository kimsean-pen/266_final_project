Now I have a nagging flaw I never saw it sneaking up
it wrapped it's dirty arms around me
Pockets full of blood
After I had seen the sight I hardly had a choice to fight
A nail snuck out behind the van and it hit me
Through my sweater and my shirt
And when I looked at Michael he heard "I need to be alone"
But when he turned his head I soon corrected "Need to be at home"
It took me all this time to get where I said I would never be
I hope it's not even out there
I hope eventually you'll see what you've been turning me into
It's all for you
It feels like 37 years and I am nothing but a bank
If we could build our credit score "Incredible," they'll surely say
But I can credit only one to focus all the fame
It has the first and last even the middle of my very name
I am the greatest man that never lived and now i never sleep
I never lost a fight but never knew I started one the same

I never knew how capable I would become
I'm tired of talking to a wall when I could talk to someone else
It's got seven days without a word
And you're with someone somewhere else
My daughter, she barely eats
She barely sleeps
She barely speaks
My daughter, she barely eats
She barely sleeps
She barely speaks to me
(To me, to me)
We spent the most of nights defending fights you fought in the past
But it was different now and I'm entirely too drunk to ask
(To me, to me)
You spend most every day enjoying the sun and hoping it lasts
(To me, to me)
I have a funny gut and feeling doubtful you'll get it back
(To me, to me)
I have a funny gut and feeling doubtful you'll get it back
Alcohol, dirty malls, Pensacola, Florida bars
