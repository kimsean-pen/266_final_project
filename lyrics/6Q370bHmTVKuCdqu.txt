We've come along way
We got lost somewhere, I don't know
But girl all I know is I can't do this on my own
It's come the hard way
Sometimes you wake up and you know
But girl I don't think that you can depend on me no more

Don't you see it
You're letting us down again
Don't you see
Your heart's not in it babe
Don't you see it
You're letting us down again
Come on admit it
It's not easy, is it?

You can rely on me
You can rely on me
Yeah I will set you free
Set you free

'Cause if your heart's not it in
Then your heart's not in it babe
If your heart's not it in
Your heart's not in it babe

I tried to hold on to you
I gave it everything I had
But it was never enough
It took everything then more than that
It's come the hard way
Some things you can't foresee
Well sometimes I've had to blind myself
In the name of empathy

Don't you see it
You're letting me down again
Don't you see
Your heart's not been in it babe
Don't you see it
You're letting us down again
Come on admit it
It's not working, is it?

But you can count on me
You can count on me
Just don't break down on me
Don't break down
Oh, no

Stop turning your light on me
Every time someone passes by
Or mentions your name
Stop turning it round on me
Telling me I'm the one
That pushed you far out to sea
Don't turn on your light on me
Wasn't it love that brought us
Right back where we're meant to be
Stop turning your back on me
Stop turning your back on me

You can rely on me
You can rely on me
Just don't walk by on me
Don't walk on by, oh yeah

Stop turning your back on me
Every time someone passes by
Or mentions your name
Stop turning your back on me
Stop turning it round on me
Telling me I'm the one
That pushed you far out to sea
Oh, if your hearts not in it
Will you tell me honestly
Don't turn on your light on me
Wasn't it love that brought us
Right back where we're meant to be
If your hearts not in it
Then there's nothing more to say
Stop turning your back on me
Stop turning your back on me
