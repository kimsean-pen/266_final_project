Sitting up all night
Picking up the pieces of your heartbreak
So I take my love inside
Anyone can see you're hurting
You're turning up the ties
And lessening the love that you're been nesting

Hold on, just as you ever spending
Hold on I'm here to take this train

Thinking of you now
I can make it better make it okay
You painted on a smile
And underneath I see it just ain't working
I know you have a scar
Where love has left you numb
You stopped believing
I know it's got to you

So find another comfort while I say

Hold on, just as you ever spending
Hold on I'm here to take this train
Hold on know that I understand
Hold on know that I take my strength

One day soon
I'm there for you
I'm asking for each other

Hold on, just as you ever spending
Hold on I'm here to take this train
Hold on know that I understand
Hold on know that I take my strength
Hold on!
