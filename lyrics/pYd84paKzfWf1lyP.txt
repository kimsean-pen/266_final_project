Ooover the night
I 'm watching over you.
The lone, through night.
I'm standing over you
Through, bad dreams... I will be

I believe in telling you
Everything is going to be alright
And when you cry...
Baby, baby . I 'm telling you, your never nothing less than beautiful

Don' t you worry.
I'm your angel standing by
