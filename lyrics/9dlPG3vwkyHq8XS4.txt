In the morning
When you wake up I
Like to believe you are
Thinking of me
And when the sun comes

Through your window I
Like to believe you've been
Dreaming of me

Dreaming, mmm
I know
'Cause I'd spend
Half this morning

Thinking about the T-shirt you sleep in
I should know
'Cause I'd spend
All the whole day
Listening to your message I'm keeping

And never deleting
When I saw you
Everyone knew I

Liked the effect that you
Had on my eyes
But no one else heard
The way of your words
Or felt the effect that they
Have on my mind
Falling, mmm
I know
'Cause I'd spend
Half this morning
Thinking about the T-shirt you sleep in
I should know
'Cause I'd spend
All the whole day
Listening to your message I'm keeping
And never deleting
