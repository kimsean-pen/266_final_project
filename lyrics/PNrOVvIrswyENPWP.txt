Hey you
It's me again
Hey you
Stone in my shoe

I've been aching
Feeling low
You're so heavy
I have got to let you go

I'm going where there's ze-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ero
Gra-a-a-a-a-a-avity
Ze-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ero
Gra-a-a-a-a-a-avity

Zero gravity
I'm free
Aah aah aah

Hey you
Lock with no key
Hey you
Earth with no sea

I've been freezing
On the ground
You're so heavy
I can't let you keep me down anymore

Oh, ze-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ero
Gra-a-a-a-a-a-avity
Ze-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ero
Gra-a-a-a-a-a-avity

(And it feels like)
Aah, ah-ah-ah-ah
(And it feels like)
Aah, ah-ah-ah-ah
(And it feels like)
Aah, ah-ah-ah-ah
(And it feels like)
Aah, ah-ah-ah-aaah

Nothing holding me down
Nothing holding me down
Nothing holding me down now
Nothing holding me down

Nothing holding me down
Nothing holding me down
Nothing holding me down now
Nothing holding me down

Ze-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ero (Nothing holding me down, nothing holding me down)
Gra-a-a-a-a-a-avity (Nothing holding me down now, nothing holding me down)
Ze-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ero (Nothing holding me down, nothing holding me down)
Gra-a-a-a-a-a-avity (Nothing holding me down now, nothing holding me down)
Ze-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ero (Nothing holding me down, nothing holding me down)
Gra-a-a-a-a-a-avity (Nothing holding me down now, nothing holding me down)
Ze-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ero (Nothing holding me down, nothing holding me down)

Aah aah aah
