I was sailing alone
Then you came along
Now, I'm singing the song you wrote

You led the way
I couldn't say
Words became lumps in my throat

I, I'm loving this sweet hurricane
In time, I know we'll meet once again

When you're belong
It's with you, I belong

Stories we told
Will never get old
Though the fire's gone cold, you're my flame

I, I'm loving this sweet hurricane
In time, I know we'll meet once again
