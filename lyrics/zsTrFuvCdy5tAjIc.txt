It could've been worse
I could've been you
I could have gone to such great lengths
Mislead the distances it took to follow suit
Burn in effigy, no you're no spectacle of empathy
Washing both my hands just to rid of you
I've got a lot to lose and you're starting to bend the truth

Your eyes are so grey
Tunnel vision, I only see you this way
And it won't change
Taking sedatives, repetitive
Till the light of day
But to you, it's dark here in my room

It could've been worse
I said wanted my own space
Whether or not I shared it with you
I was a book and you read one page
I was overlooked
Can't understand the knots in your noose
I overheard the lies that slipped through
You live in disarray
(But you're stuck in your ways!)

Your eyes are so grey
Tunnel vision, I only see you this way
And it won't change
Taking sedatives, repetitive
Till the light of day
But to you, it's dark here in my room

It could have been worse
You could've been me
You could've been me
It could've been worse
I could've been you
Are you blind just because you choose?

Your eyes are so grey
Tunnel vision, I only see you this way
But it won't change
Taking sedatives, repetitive
Till the light of day
But to you, I'm your obstructed view
