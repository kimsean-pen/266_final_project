You grew high, taller than the middle class
Boy, cash running in your pockets
You skate high, gold on your finger tips
They try to make people nervous

There's something missing in your smile
Something missing in your soul
Are you suffering the blues?
Tell me why, tell me when, tell me why, when

Yeah, green dollar bills slipped your hand, little man
Anything you wanna come instantly
Boy, when the plan slipped your hand, little man
Everything you wanna come instantly

Castle, house, cars and the ladies
Blues, no doubt, got you feeling empty, man
Your bank's packed to the edge and still you're sad

Something missing in your smile
Something missing in your soul
Are you suffering the blues?
Tell me why, when, why, when

Green dollar bills slipped your hand, little man
Anything you wanna come instantly
Boy, when the plan slipped your hand, little man
Everything you wanna come instantly
