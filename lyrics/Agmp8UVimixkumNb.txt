It's a mystery, too good to be true
I find my purpose when I look at you
I bleed transparent
It's not the way I choose
But it's only when I'm vulnerable my true colors shine through

For a moment
I'm a poet without words
Speechless because you love me at my worst
I don't deserve this
I let it surface
And all I know is today I woke up falling in love again

Starving artist, no match for a queen,
But walls come down and
Love's limitless when you find what's meant to be
Supernatural, it's more than what we see
A trust that can't be broken seemed impossible to me
But I've tasted true love and I believe!

For a moment
I'm a poet without words
Speechless because you love me at my worst
I don't deserve this
I let it surface
And all I know is today I woke up falling in love again

For a moment
I'm a poet without words
Speechless because you love me at my worst
I don't deserve this
I let it surface
And all I know is today I woke up falling in love again
