Midnight, it's raining outside, he must be soaking wet
Everyone is sleeping tight, God knows I tried my best
Darling, you know it looks bad
Just lost the best thing that I ever had, well
Still I don't know why I did him wrong, no
It's too late, now, he's gone to say

CHORUS
Baby, oh, no, can't leave me now
Said, think about it, please
'Cause I love you, and I need you
And I should have thought of that before I did you wrong, yeah
Before I did you wrong
I should have thought of that
Oo, before I did you wrong

Heartache, heartache, yeah
When I saw his face I could see how bad I'd let him down
Cheating when he was working hard, I just had to mess around
I knew from the start he ain't got much money
I should have stayed content with all that good, sweet honey
He's a good, strong man, and I love him so
So how on Earth can I let him go? said, whoah

CHORUS

And now, it's midnight, it's raining outside, yeah
And I'm soaking wet, still looking for that man of mine
And I ain't found him yet, well
All of this rain can wash away my tears
But nothing can replace all of those wasted years
In all of this I tell you I have learnt
Playing with fire gets you burnt
And I'm still burning

CHORUS

You say you'll lose your pride
Well, don't you know, dear? don't you know
I'll lose so much more if you go now?
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no

Said, whoah
Do do

Do do do-do do do-do do-do do
Do do do-do do-do-do-do-do-do
Do do do do do
Na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-na-na-na
Da-da da da-da da, ba ba-da
Da do da no
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
