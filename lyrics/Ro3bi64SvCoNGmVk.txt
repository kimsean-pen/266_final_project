I stood on the 66 highway
I stood on the 66 highway
Wysteria, Magnolia beside the green line track
Said "Don't Come Back"

I found myself standing on the mountain
I found myself standing on the mountain
Beneath my full moon heart
John Henry split this heart, split this full moon heart
John Henry split this heart, split this full moon heart

Swing the heaviest hammer you got
Hit this one out of the park
John Henry split my heart

He says, "Boy what you going to do
With your heart in two?"
"Boy what you going to do
With your heart in two?"

If its good enough
Only if its good enough
If its good enough
But only if its good enough

Half, I'm going to use
To pay this band
Half, I'm saving
'Cause I'm going to owe them
