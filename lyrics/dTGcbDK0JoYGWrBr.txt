We ride along the great riverside
Ever so wide? the cleaver of clarity
She'll be wise enough to make assumption?
The moment we reach heavenly lands

Heavenly, heavenly
We focus on
We follow fatefuly
Fatefuly, fatefuly
Slowly and surely we'll find our way

Be at the present unexpected life is
All of we wanted
All that we choose to live
We will rise above and all the chances
In between

I tried to move it, you open up your mind
His baring city grounds
Make you never look behind
Gone
Maybe wise enough and you will understand
The moment she reach heavenly land

Heavenly, heavenly
We focus on
We follow fatefuly
Fatefuly, fatefuly
Slowly and surely we'll find our way

Be at the present unexpected life is
All of we wanted
All that we choose to live
We will rise above and all the chances
In between

Strong winds on desert grounds
Release the tendency
And hold it like a cloud
Enlighten and breezing
Hands us strained breeze
If only we understand
Strong winds on desert grounds
Foresee our lives
