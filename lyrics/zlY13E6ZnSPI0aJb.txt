Come on dream on

Come on dream on boy

your dream will come alive
Come on dream on, come on dream on
Come on dream on, boy, your dream will come alive
Once again a song comin' strong
Here to remind you got to dream on.
Go for what you know don't let it slide
Take a change let's ride.
To the future not to the past
Take it easy and not too fast.
Many failed in society
To blind to see you need to be free.
Free from the strain that causes pain
Pain is the name and life is the game.

Dream on try to survive

Keep hope alive reach for the sky.

Do the best you can make a wish come true
Listen here's the clue: Let it flow before it's all gone
Come on boy you got to dream on

Dreams are the way to express yourself from the heart
Now it's time to depart
On a journey for the mind
Peace of mind is what you will find.
Like Martin Luther King
I had a dream, that we all would sing
In peace and harmony comin' strong.
Come on boy you got to dream on
dreams to survive
dreams make a wish comes true oooh
keep your dreams alive
dream... dream on
your dream will come alive
come on dream on
come on dream on
come on dream on boy
your dream will come alive
