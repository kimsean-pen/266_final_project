I can't hide, no
On the mantle
I'm not sad
Until I'm home

It's the season
I'm all reason
I have seen
All I have grown

Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me

And not seen
And not seen
And not seen
Cheat on me

At the seams
I'm a lender
I'm a planter
I put something

In the garden
In the handle
On the mantle
I met Santa

I met God
Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
And not seen
And not seen
And not seen
Cheat on me
I'm a lady
Can you save me?
It's the sulfur
I have grown
'Tis the season
I'm all reason
I have fleas
So run on home
Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
At the seams
And not seen
Cheat on me
