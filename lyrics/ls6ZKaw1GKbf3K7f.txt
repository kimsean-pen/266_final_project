Give me everything
I could never be
should be dead but I'm still breathing
Lights are fading
concentrating, on Your voice to keep from breaking

Show me everything I could never see
I wanna know what's all around me
Now I'm finding
lights are blinding
letting go of all I'm hiding

I'm falling
I'm fading
I'm reaching
I'm finding

I can't breath without You
I'm stuck inside of me

I'm not free without You

there's nothing left of me

Break me down then
build me up again

speak to me and make me listen
Sick of waiting

suffocating
everything I am is fading

Show me everything I could never be
I wanna know You're all around me
Now I'm finding
life is blinding
letting go of all I'm hiding
I'm falling
I'm fading
I'm reaching
I'm finding
I can't breath without You
I'm stuck inside of me
I'm not free without You
there's nothing left of me
I can't breath without You
I'm stuck inside of me
I'm not free without You
there's nothing left of me
I'm falling
I'm fading
I'm reaching
I'm finding
I'm falling
I'm fading
I'm reaching
I'm finding
I can't breath without You
I'm stuck inside of me
I'm not free without You
there's nothing left of me
I can't breath without You
I'm stuck inside of me
I'm not free without You
there's nothing left of me
