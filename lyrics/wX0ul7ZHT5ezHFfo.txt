Held out a plastic rope
Needed to tie a fuse
Held out a plastic rope
Tied to a bite ring

Well I'm lovesick baby
I'm lovestruck, ready to construct
Ready to love
Oh sure, hoping that you're fooling

Every time I'm ready to hug
It's the same
Every time I'm ready to play
You don't know what to do

Well I'm lovesick baby
I'm lovestruck, ready to construct
Ready to love
Every time I'm ready to hug

Well if you're just blowing smoke
Baby you like me
You think it's just a joke
I don't think you'd like me

Well I'm lovesick baby
I'm lovestruck, ready to construct
Ready to love
Oh sure, hoping that you're fooling

Every time I'm ready to hug
It's the same way
Every time I'm ready to play
You don't know what to do

Well I'm lovesick baby
I'm lovestruck, ready to construct
Ready to love
Every time I'm ready to hug

Ooh, ooh, I'm down
Ooh, ooh, guess I'll just wait it out

Every time I'm ready to hug
It's the same way
Every time I'm ready to play
You don't know what to do

Well I'm lovesick baby
I'm lovestruck, ready to construct
Ready to love
Every time I'm ready to hug
