Though I'm tired just sitting here talking with you
There's better things y'know a lonely rock 'n' roller can do

The hour is getting late
They're putting all our dreams away

And lord have mercy on all of our thoughts today

I should get away
But I would rather stay and dance
C'mon darling let's dance

Although I'm tired just sitting here falling for you
There's better things y'know a lonely boy and girl can do

The hour is getting late
They're pulling all the curtains drawn
We got the rest of our lives 'til the coming dawn

Hold my hand awhile
We'll go out in style
And dance
C'mon darling let's dance

I'll say a little prayer for us girl
I'll say a little prayer for us girl

Though I'm tired just sitting here singing for you
There's better things y'know a lonely rock 'n' roller can do
The hour is getting late
They're putting all the chairs away
If they've got Big Star on the radio they'll let us stay

Oh, September girl
Come and rule my world
And dance

C'mon darling let's dance
C'mon baby let's dance
C'mon darling let's dance
C'mon baby let's dance
C'mon darling let's dance

I'll say a little prayer for us girl
I'll say a little prayer for us girl

Show a little love
I'll keep it close to mine and
Have a little heart

I'll keep my own in time and
Show a little love

I'll keep it close to mine
And dance
