I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force fed demise

I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force fed demise

Get out of my head!
Someone save me from this madness, I'd rather be dead!
All I see is reality, fabricated by something
I refuse to see

You know who I am
You created me by letting yourself believe
Take my cold dead hands
And go six feet down, your failure is found

I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force fed demise

I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force fed demise

Take me away, take me away
Take me away, I just want out
Take me away, I just want out
From this self-imprisoned, self-made hell

Don't be surprised, this is your mind
Coming to life by self-sacrifice
This tragedy of death will walk hand in hand with every thought of regret
Blame yourself for what you've become

The mind is a powerful thing set to self-destruct
Mind-fucked, you had your chance
Your time, this is the end of the line
This is the end of the line, this is the end
I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind, blind, your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force fed demise
We will slowly rot until this is stopped
