Say it loud
(Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)
We'd love to love to love ya'
Love to love to love ya'

Say it loud
(Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)
We'd love to love to love ya'
Love to love to love ya'

I put my name on the line for love
'Cause this is what I've been waiting for
I saw it all like a sign above
So follow me, follow me

Tell me baby, that you love me (love me)
There's nothing higher, higher than me
If love and freedom's all that we need
Then follow me, follow me

Say it loud
(Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)
We'd love to love to love ya'
Love to love to love ya'

Say it loud
(Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)
We'd love to love to love ya'
Love to love to love ya'

I put my name on the line for love
Together we'll break down the walls
This is a different kind of war
So follow me, follow me

Tell me baby, that you love me (love me)
There's nothing higher, higher than me
If love and freedom's all that we need
Then follow me, follow me

Come one, come all
We're building an army, building an army
Come down, come down
We're building an army, an army of love

Say it loud
(Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)
We'd love to love to love ya'
Love to love to love ya'

Say it loud
(Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)
We'd love to love to love ya'
Love to love to love ya'

So let's go on, let's go on
On and on for love
So let's go on, let's go on
On and on for love

(For love)
Tell me baby, that you love me
(For love)
There's nothing higher, higher than me
(For love)
If love and freedom's all that we need
(For love)
Then follow me, (For love) follow me
Say it loud
(Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)
We'd love to love to love ya'
Love to love to love ya'
Say it loud
(Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)
