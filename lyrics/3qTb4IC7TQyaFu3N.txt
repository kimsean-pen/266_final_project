Open up, it's revealed
Savor this
Don't get lost in the lie
Hit or miss
Whoa, beside
Myself
With doubt
Push on
What's to come will be proved
Focus bliss
Charcoal stares
One foot at a time
Smear those lines

Chorus:
It's what
I thought I found
What I always wanted
There with me
It's what
I thought I found
What I always wanted
there with me

Certainty
Is not at hand
I can't keep my eyes shut
You're taught not to listen

Chorus

I got what I wanted
I got just what I always wanted
I got what I wanted
I got just what I always wanted

What I thought
