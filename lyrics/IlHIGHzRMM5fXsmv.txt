Get yourself, get yourself together now
Go get yourself, get yourself together now
Get yourself, get yourself together now
Go get yourself, get yourself together now

Girl he did you wrong, now you're all alone all alone
Tellin' all our friends that you never saw it comin' on

Everyone could see what a creep, what a creep he was
How could you believe all this cheap talk, that's dangerous

Eye for an aye for every lie he ever told ya (he ever told ya)
Don't make it right for ever time he never called ya
(he never called ya)
Don't you know you got it all and you deserve it aaaall yeaaah

Get yourself, get yourself together now
Go get yourself, get yourself together now
Get yourself, get yourself together now
Go get yourself, get yourself together now

Girl, he's such a freak, what a snake, what'd ya think he was
Don't you hear the hiss in his kiss
Girl, he's poisonous

Everyone could see what a fool, what a fool he was
You were wrecked and weak, so intrigued, that's ridiculous

Eye for an aye for every lie he ever told ya (he ever told ya)
Don't make it right for ever time he never called ya
(he never called ya)
Don't you know you got it all and you deserve it aaaall yeaaah

Get yourself, get yourself together now
Go get yourself, get yourself together now
Get yourself, get yourself together now
Go get yourself, get yourself together now

(don't give in)

Dirty dirty dirty little liar
Dirty dirty dirty little
Dirty dirty dirty little
Dirty dirty dirty little

Oh, no good, soul taking, heart breakin',
oeeh

Eye for an aye for every lie mmm(he ever told ya)
Don't make it right for ever time yeah
(he never called ya)
Don't you know you got it all and you deserve it aaaall yeaaah
Eye for an aye for every lie mmm(he ever told ya)
Don't make it right for ever time yeah
(he never called ya)
Don't you know you got it all and you deserve it aaaall yeaaah

Get yourself, get yourself together now
Go get yourself, get yourself together now
Get yourself, get yourself together now
Go get yourself, get yourself together now
