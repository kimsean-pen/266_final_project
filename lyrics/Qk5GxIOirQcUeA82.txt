Hear my promise of blistering light
Sowing a rose of obsidian
My dear, I promise death comes to all
In a heartbeat, only silence
Let's play with the fire that runs in our veins
Trust in the might of a miracle
Now winter has come and I stand in the snow
I don't feel the cold
And it's all that I will ever need to believe

One day I know we will meet again
In shade of a life to die for
Watching the world through the eyes of a child
In Elysium
Will I know you then?
(Will I know you then?)

Now bring down your fortress and swallow your pride
Don't break in your moments of ignorance
Existence will capture a spark of life
Just a fragment, but it's all that I will ever need to revive

One day I know we will meet again
In shade of a life to die for
Watching the world through the eyes of a child
In Elysium
Will I find you there?
In the darkness of the shadow that comes over all
Dear friend, will I know you then?
Will I know you then at all?

One day I know we will meet again
In the shade of a life to die for
Watching the world through the eyes of a child
In Elysium
Will I know you then?
Will I know you then?
