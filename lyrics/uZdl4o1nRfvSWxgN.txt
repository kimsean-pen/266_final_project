And this blood on my hands
Now it won't go away
I've been out on this road for days
And the fear on the wall
Watch it slowly cascade
As the door holds the wolves at bay
The emptiness is building from
The nothingness that we've all become
The emptiness is building from
The nothingness that we've all become
And this road that I've chose
Seems it's taken its' toll
Leading far far away from the soul
And the fear on the wall
Watch it slowly cascade
As the door holds the wolves at bay
The emptiness is building from
The nothingness that we've all become
The emptiness is building from
The nothingness that we've all become
This thing I've become seems its' taken control
Of my mind and my body my will and my soul
Driving further and further away from my self
Until there's none of me left I've become something else
The emptiness is building from
The nothingness that we've all become
The emptiness is building from
The nothingness that we've all become
