You're scared 'cause I am too
This feeling in my head is being there for too long
We sleep now with the light on,
But shadows make shapes in the light
And I don't know what they might be!

You cold, because I am too
So cover your toes with the jacket in your hands
And the bones with the blanket
She tells me that I will be alright
And for a seconds it feels that I believe it
'Cause I forget the way that I've felt
I'm trying, I'm just trying to be BRAVE
Uuh-uh uuh-uh, trying, I'm just trying to be BRAVE

There's somebody who heard it that splits us right down the middle
But i'll be coming back for you

You lost me 'cause I answered
Directions mean nothing in the dark
And I don't know where you stand
The maps are gone, so are our footprints too
To get home now will take something that I'm not sure that I have left
Trying, I'm trying to be BRAVE.
Uuh-uh uuh-uh, I'm just trying to be BRAVE

There's somebody who heard it that splits us right down to the middle
But I'd be coming back for you
I'd be coming back for you
I'd be coming back for you
I'd be coming back for you
