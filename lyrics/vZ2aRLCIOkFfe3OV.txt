Don't be so hard on yourself
The name of the game is humiliation,
And thanks for your admiration.
I never thought I'd say this:
The way that we play has its confrontation,
And guilt by association.

Hold me, hold me, if I were to
I can't, can't, I swear I can't let you
It's all in your hands, so I'll do what I can
So you, you can do what you have to

Hold me, hold me, if I were to
I can't, can't, I swear I can't let you
It's all in your hands, so I'll do what I can
So you, you can do what you have to

Don't think too hard about it,
You never thought I'd get this far,
Would get this far without you.
Relax, stand back and watch it happen.
I'll wave my goodbyes into the night and say

Hold me, hold me, if I were to
I can't, can't, I swear I can't let you
It's all in your hands, so I'll do what I can
So you, you can do what you have to

Hold me, hold me, if I were to
I can't, can't, I swear I can't let you
It's all in your hands, so I'll do what I can
So you, you can do what you have to

Say you'll never, ever. Say you'll never, ever.
Say you'll never let me go.
Say you'll never, ever. Say you'll never, ever.
Say you'll never tell a soul.

Say you'll never, ever. Say you'll never, ever.
Say you'll never let me go.
Say you'll never, ever. Say you'll never, ever.
Say you'll never tell a soul.

Hold me, hold me, if I were to
I can't, can't, I swear I can't let you
It's all in your hands, so I'll do what I can
So you, you can do what you have to

Hold me, hold me, if I were to
I can't, can't, I swear I can't let you
It's all in your hands, so I'll do what I can
So you, you can do what you have to
