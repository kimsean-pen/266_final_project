Sometimes I lose my time to play
with that Girl
Lose my time to drive that Way
Somebody
Everytime the same old Days
Everytime

Everybody dance

And Everybody dance
Everybody dance
And Everybody dance
Everybody dance

Today Today
I lose my Name
your Help
Had not effect

I'm not able
to Live

Oh no!

You dance
Every Night
Tonight
You dance
Every Night
Tonight
You dance
Every Night
Tonight

Tonight
I need You

Somebody else can catch that Way
I don't try
Somebody else can catch that Way
I don't try

Everybody's Night
to love You
Everybody's Night
to love You
Everybody's Night
to love You
Everybody's Night
to love You.
