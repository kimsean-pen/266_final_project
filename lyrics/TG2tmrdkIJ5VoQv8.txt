maybe I guess
he will be alone
'cause we are equally damaged
find your name
do all the same, equally
signal when you can't breathe no more

say you were me
then you could see the view
you know we are equally damaged
don't be a fool
make it easier
you learn to say when
signal if you can't say no more

ah ha ha ha ha

oh don't cross your fingers
sundays will never change
they keep on comin'
you'll be a freak
and I'll keep you
company
