I'm no good with maps
and no sense of direction
and I can't write anything
without autocorrection
I just can't keep up with this curriculum
I wish I could learn in my sleep
I've got a problem with problems
I'm not punctual
I get lost in context
and sentence construction
I've never said this to anyone before
I've never said it out loud
