And I hate the way you see me
Like a man who can't be fixed
Like a fool fooling all but you
Who he really is

And I hate the way you hold me
Nervous as a cat
Like I might give in the big idea
You'd forgive me just like that

I wouldn't have it any other way
Heaven knows a sinner needs a saint
Oh but when I've been at my most ugly
I hate the way you love me

You're a hard woman to live with
I could never fill those shoes
An example for our children
I could never live up to

And I hate myself for staying
Where I should and should not be
Someone I know I don't deserve
And doesn't deserve me

I wouldn't have it any other way
Heaven knows a sinner needs a saint
Oh but when I've been at my most ugly
I hate the way you love me

I wouldn't have it any other way
Heaven knows a sinner needs a saint
And I love your everything-I-ain't
But I hate the way
Yes, I hate the way
You love me
