I met you at the summer camp
All alone
Stealing ancient artifacts
Burning homes
I don't really understand
Why anyone forgives us
I don't wanna hold your hand
I just wanna give up
Swallowing the stairs again
On the floor
Crashing in your fathers car
Like we did before
I don't really understand
If anyone would miss us
I don't wanna hold your hand
If you're just gonna give up
Chocolate cake and lava lamps
I'm not even alive yet
I just wanna hold your hand
While everybodys's dying
And you're not even trying
You're not even trying
