Everyone else is so repetitious
Their motivation is so suspicious
Up in the hills with no reception
Don't need to explain my intentions
Everyone else is imaginary
When I'm with you that's my sanctuary
Up in the clouds with no reception
Don't need to explain my intentions
Falling off a bit on purpose
I want you below the surface
Closing all the curtains
Twisting up two Ls
Keep it to ourselves

Everyone's sleeping
I'm in the deep end
Everyone's sleeping

Tried to stay enlightened in the night time
Spending all my money on a free mind
280 Mercedes with the peace sign
Shady with my baby by the pool side
I want you below the surface
Falling off a bit on purpose
Leave the world turning
Seasons inverting
Won't let my heart melt
Keep it to ourselves
Everyone's sleeping
I'm in the deep end
Everyone's sleeping
It's only a feeling
