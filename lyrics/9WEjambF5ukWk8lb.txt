i feel like letting you know
how much i love you today
i feel like letting it show
showing you rightly now
and never going away

i know you're feeling real low
calling on all my
i want to make it ok
i want to show you i know
and it will be all fine
i want to take it away
take it away

i thought i'ld write you this song
maybe i'd make you smile
and take your sadness away
hey
i want to show you i love
love love you a long time girl
i'm never going away
hey,
hey
hey
hey
