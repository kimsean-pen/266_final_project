Long's the life
Steep's the climb
I took the match and i lit the fire, fire
Pain for the pain
My Guts ache
Built by the sin that was taught by the father, the father

Now come and walk with me

A journey of a 1000 miles it starts with one step
Plowing out the rows, the bleeding of the rose
A butterfly's wings can start tornados don't ya know
Harvesting the souls, burying the bones

Deep is the hole
Shovel's always full
I bit the dog and i beat the master, master
Eye for an eye
Tooth's been pulled
Lost all control that was taught by the mother, the mother

Now come and walk with me

A journey of a 1000 miles it starts with one step
Plowing out the rows, the bleeding of the rose
A butterfly's wings can start tornados don't ya know
Harvesting the souls, burying the bones

Another feeble man
Arms outstretched in a distant land
Wonders where it all went wrong
He's followed us too long
Another fallen man
That failed to make a stand
What have i done wrong
Left here all alone
The voice inside my head
Is it me or an alien?
Throw me down the stairs
Since i just don't care anymore

I can't take the wind, i can't fight the storm anymore
I don't have the will, i can't be the storn anymore

A journey of a 1000 miles it starts with one step
Plowing out the rows, the bleeding of the rose
A butterfly's wings can start tornados don't ya know
Harvesting the souls, burying the bones
The hurricane's eye is like the calm before the storm
Darkening the shore, settling the score
A butterfly's wings can start tornados don't ya know
Harvesting the souls, burying the bones of old
