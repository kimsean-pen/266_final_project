I wrote to you
With in a melody
If you decide to sing
Would you sing it back to me
Sing it right through those crooked teeth

You rescued me when my mind was in a prison
You set me free when no one else would listen
Now I finally feel complete
And I will follow you into the sea of eternity

Collapse into my arms
I'll take care of your heart
Though the distance grows between us girl
Our love won't fall apart
I'll take care of your heart
No matter where we are

I know you feel incomplete
The world is nothing without ya, you see
If I had spent my dying breath convincing you of nothing less
You're lovely
You're oh so lovely
And I'm so lucky
I'm so damn lucky
And I need you to know that I'm incomplete yet completely free

When you collapse into my arms
I'll take care of your heart
Though the distance grows between us girl
Our love won't fall apart
I'll take care of your heart
No matter where we are

Some day dispite our age
We'll turn the page
And our daughter will
Collapse into my arms
I'll take care of her heart
Though the distance grows between us girl
Our love won't fall apart
I'll take care of your heart
No matter where we are
