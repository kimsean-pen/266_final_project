It's a fool's, fool's game
Lover, that we have to play
Crashing into each other
No convalescing

It's a leap of faith
Lover, that we blindly take
I'm taking it with you and no other
No hesitating

And if our minds they go
And our bones they shatter
We'll put it on nobody
But ourselves

It's an old refrain
Lover, that we hear again
Urging a cautious measure
Sounding a warning

It's a thin escape
Lover, that we hope to make
When we're beaten, broken and battered
Beyond consoling

And the breezes blow
And to the winds we're scattered
And we're fending for nobody
But ourselves

It's a fool's, fool's game
When you've nothing but a heart to break
Better keep on breaking it, lover
Until it opens

It's a speeding train
Beating through the pouring rain
With no way to slow or stop it
And the tracks are broken

Like a rising wave
Through the storms we gather
And we're falling on nobody
But ourselves
