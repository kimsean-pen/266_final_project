Crowded streets are cleared away one by one
Hollow heroes seperate as they run
You're so cold keep your hand in mine
Wise men wonder while strong men die

Show me how it ends, it's alright
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well that's alright
Let's give this another try

If you find your family don't you cry
In this land of make believe dead and dry
You're so cold but you feel alive
Lay your head on me one last time

Show me how it ends it's alright
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well that's alright
Let's give this another try

Show me how it ends it's alright
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well that's alright
Let's give this another try

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
