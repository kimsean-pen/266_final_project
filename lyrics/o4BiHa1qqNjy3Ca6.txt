Long is the day, take it away
Hold it up and you don't let it fall
Cause devil's play was yesterday
And I don't care about that at all

I just smile, once in a while
Cause I don't want the lines on my face
And I sit right here, holdin' the years
And I count all the stars in space

You fall apart again
And you can find a friend
Don't turn to someone else
Cause they won't understand

Self respect, goes unexpressed
I don't dream cause I cannot sleep
And I think the world of myself
But the world doesn't think much of me

As long as the day is full of time
There will always be room
For your hand in mine

You fall apart again
And you can find a friend
Don't turn to someone else
Cause they won't understand

I don't wanna hear you say
That you miss yesterday
If you don't like what you see
That means nothin' to me

No one's home, I'm alone
With my music and my defeat
And I still say, that yesterday
Is best when left to sleep

You fall apart again
And you can find a friend
Don't turn to someone else
Cause they won't understand

I don't wanna hear you say
That you miss yesterday
If you don't like what you see
That means nothin' to me
That means nothin' to me
