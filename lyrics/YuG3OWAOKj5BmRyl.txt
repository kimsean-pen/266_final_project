I miss Michael and Whitney and Tina and James
And the Fugees and Lauryn, I miss Kurt Cobain
I miss Stevie, I wonder would things be the same
I miss music, hey, hey

I miss watching the countdowns when videos played
I miss one love imagine if purple still rained
I miss TLC, Aerosmith, Biggie and Sting
I miss music, hey, hey

Oho, what am I gonna sing to?
Oho, what am I gonna sing to?

What about all the children who never knew Pac
Ever Aaliyah, Jodeci, N Sync or Nas
Boyz ll Men, Babyface, Bobby or Faith
I miss music, hey, hey

Oho, what am I gonna sing to?
Oho, what am I gonna sing to?

I know I'm not the only one
Who misses how the Rick respond
And saying to every song they play hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Oho, what am I gonna sing to?
Oho, what am I gonna sing to?
Oho, what am I gonna sing to?
Oho, what am I gonna sing to?
Without you
