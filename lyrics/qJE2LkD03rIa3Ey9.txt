Didn't I say to you not too recent
It was never gonna stay
It was never gonna stay here
You're like the moon in a basket of wheat
You rose out of the roses
Right under my mouth

A far away cry from this petty little town
Shine back, we will notice
Though you never owed us
Some passionately painted creatures were meant
To descend from the bleachers
Without much more than a promise
Well, you got it in your gut stinking
I could taste it in your paint
When you left and when you came
Like a remarkable mellow feeling
But that won't make it remarkable feeling

Didn't I taste it, feel it and know
In so many ways, so many ways
The feel of your honey in the corner of my mouth
Like a loop around the block
Like a shadow in your notebook
Oh c'mon what's based in rhyme doesn't matter
Now we pause the tape for some laughter
I won't accept the conceit any further
I will return it to you in a fervor
Oh

Hey hey
Hey hey

Oh come on

My sole cousin told me I was featured in a play
I was meant to take the stage, I turned to him okay
And in it we drove all night and you smiled so much
You got creases on your face, the kind that give you grace
And I try to keep cool regardless of what
I know to be true, I know to be true
You got good timing and you listen blindly
You're a street fighter, no prize fighter, well

Desire, desire
It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay)
It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay)
Desire, desire
It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay)
It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay)

Well, fictions are frightening
Like statues in lightning
And I wore my boot sole
And you gave it a new hole
Well

Desire, desire
It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay)
It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay)
Desire, desire
It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay)
It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay)

Woah oh oh oh oh
(Never gonna stay)
(Never gonna stay)
Woah oh oh oh oh
(Never gonna stay)
(Never gonna stay)
Hmmm
Hmmm (Never gonna stay)
Hmmm (Never gonna stay)
Hmmm
Hmm
Woah oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh
