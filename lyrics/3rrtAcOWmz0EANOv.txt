Took a step in the right direction
Even though we only saw a reflection
In all consistency and an instant way
And it seems like we're just strangers by now
We're just strangers by now

I always thought that we were meant to last
I always thought that we were set in stone
And I've been losing sleep
And losing count of sheep
I'm just another headache that you don't wanna deal with

Torn to shreds, rebuild again
From now on, I am nothing but numb
I'm moving slow and even though it's only been a year
And it feels like we're just strangers by now
We're just strangers by now

I always thought that we were meant to last
I always thought that we were set in stone
And I've been losing sleep
And losing count of sheep
I'm just another headache that you don't wanna deal with

It's safe to say
"Be someone who's so far away"
It's safe to say
Everything I see is dark grey
All I see is dark grey
All I see is dark grey

I always thought that we were meant to last
I always thought that we were set in stone
And I've been losing sleep
And losing count of sheep
I'm just another headache that you don't wanna deal with
