Stay as still as
You think you should be
Your stolen memories
Will find you
In the last place
You would think to look
All the time that it took to locate
Maybe it'll just pass by you
Or rip right through your heart
Underneath the surface
We break apart

Disappeared from public places never seen again
How long has it been?
How long has it been?

Underneath the surface
None of us deserve this
Underneath the surface we break apart

Disappeared from public places never seen again
How long has it been?
How long has it been?

I don't want excuses
I don't want apologies

Disappeared from public places never seen again
How long has it been?
How long has it been?
