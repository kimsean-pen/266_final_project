It came out of the blue,
Like a brand new story, waiting to begin.
Like the stars and the moon,
Were countin' on me to go rushin' in!
Now the answer's all around,
It's all that I can do to keep my feet on the ground.
Cause when the tears roll down my face,
Only you can make it better.
When it rains on my days,
I know you can change the weather.
I'm breaking down and there's no one around
Then it's you I'm thinking of,
But it's too soon to call it love.
And always makin' me slow,
Takin' somethin' one step at a time.
When it's too soon to know,
Where it's goin' just to stand behind a line.
When the answer's all around,
No point in letting go of the thing that you have found.
Cause when the tears roll down my face,
Only you can make it better.
When it rains on my days,
I know you can change the weather.
I'm breaking down and there's no one around
Then it's you I'm thinking of,
But it's too soon to call it love.
Cause when the tears roll down my face,
Only you can make it better.
When it rains on my days,
I know you can change the weather.
I'm breaking down and there's no one around
Then it's you I'm thinking of,
But it's too soon to call it love.
