Light wash opens the sky
On 79th, the blue in your eyes
Everyone is sedated
This was the strangest night of our lives

And all the taxi cabs
Wouldn't take us back
I'm not mad at that
'Cause now it's just you and me
Skipping between the trash and the streets

We might not make it home
And that sounds wonderful

Isn't it strange I don't know your name?
'Cause when [?]
Swallow the sound when you open your mouth
Hey, but it's all the same

Felt like me and you
Were the only two
In that sweaty room
(Hey, hey, hey!)
So let's capture the night
Don't leave my side
We're safe in the world

We might not make it home
And that sounds wonderful

Don't complicate it 'cause
Baby it's not that complicated
Don't complicate it 'cause
(We might not make it home)
Baby it's not that complicated
Don't complicate it 'cause
Baby it's not that complicated
Don't complicate it, babe
(And that sounds wonderful)

Stoplight, long nights
Talking eye to eye
Not going home, home
First light, sunrise
Falling so high
I'm not going home, home

We might not make it home
And that sounds wonderful

Don't complicate it 'cause
Baby it's not that complicated
Don't complicate it 'cause
(We might not make it home)
Baby it's not that complicated
Don't complicate it 'cause
Baby it's not that complicated
Don't complicate it, babe
(And that sounds wonderful)
We might not make it home
And that sounds wonderful
