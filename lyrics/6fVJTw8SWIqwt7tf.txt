I wanna change apartments
I wanna leave this place
But I never do
And it's because of you
I wanna leave this city
But tell me what to do
'Cause you're boring me
I wish that you would come with me

Now we could be perfect
You could have made me better
Now we could be soulmates
And we could stay together
Now we could be perfect
You could have made me better
And we could be soulmates
If we could find a place to live

I wanna leave this country
I wanna free this land
I can, how about you?
Know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna leave this planet
And I will follow your way
To a distant star
Baby, take me far away

Now we could be perfect
You could have made me better
Now we could be soulmates
And we could stay together
Now we could be perfect
You could have made me better
And we could be soulmates
If we could find a place to live

Now we could be perfect
You could have made me better
And we could be soulmates
Now we could be perfect
You could have made me better
And we could be soulmates

Now we could be perfect
You could have made me better
And we could be soulmates
Now we could be perfect
You could have made me better
And we could be soulmates
