Leader of the pack, fire burning fast
Faster than the speed of light, sound & vision
Driver of the year, conquer every fear
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Destiny is mine, cross the finish line
Rules never apply to a soul in motion
Never turning back, wave the checkered flag
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Destiny is mine ...to a soul in motion
Rules never apply to a soul
