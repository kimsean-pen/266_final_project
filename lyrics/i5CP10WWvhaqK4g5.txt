Why did I met you you then I can't believe, believe -eve
can't can't believe
why did I met you you then I can't believe, believe -eve
can't can't believe
La la la la la
Back when I'm magic I could not forget you
try to leave me I won't let you
you know I bet you'll never go
'cause you know the way our story goes
we can take it slow
Why did I met you you then I can't believe, believe -eve
can't can't believe
Why did I met you you then I can't believe, believe -eve
can't can't believe

Sleep and sliding on the way
drift and drowning on the way

Why did I met you you then I can't believe, believe -eve
can't can't believe
Why did I met you you then I can't believe, believe -eve
can't can't believe

Sleep and sliding on the way
drift and drowning on the way
sleep and slide
