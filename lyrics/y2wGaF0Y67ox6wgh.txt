You call me crying
The middle of the night
I'm on my knees
You've got me praying for a sign
It's all wrong, she's looking for a fight
Just say my name and I'll come running

Don't get me wrong
I hear your reasons
You get along over the weekends
But I got it bad
Yeah I'm not sleeping
And every time I hear her name my heart is breaking

Pick it up baby if we're moving too slow
I got the seat back, windows up
Just say it, I'm yours
Now every word is heavy
Tell me what you wanna know
You're my shotgun lover and I want it all

Every time we talk all night
You've only got one foot in the river baby why
If only I could read your mind
You've got your finger on the trigger baby
Give in to me

Don't get me wrong
I hear your reasons
You get along over the weekends
But I got it bad
Yeah I'm not sleeping
And every time I hear her name my heart is breaking

Pick it up baby if we're moving too slow
I got the seat back, windows up
Just say it, I'm yours
Now every word is heavy
Tell me what you wanna know
You're my shotgun lover and I want it all

Starry eyed, I was young and undone
But I could've died with you there in the sun

Pick it up baby if we're moving too slow
I got the seat back, windows up
Just say it, I'm yours
Now every word is heavy
Tell me what you wanna know
You're my shotgun lover and I want it all

Starry eyed, I was young and undone
But I could've died with you there in the sun

You're my shotgun lover and I want it all
