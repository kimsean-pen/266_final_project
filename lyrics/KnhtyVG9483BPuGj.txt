Reverence so uncomfortable
You sit across the room
Cause I'm too scared to talk to you

You knew a friend I knew a friend
I looked down at your hands
Pretending I was looking at the floor

I held your eyes for quite sometime
I'm not sure how it happened
I was just surprised
Were you surprised?

I walk in the breeze
Like I am seventeen
Love is mostly war
And war what is it for?

Only love the people
Who don't love you back
What is up with that?
Are you done with that?

I can't say I'm much different
Cause I still love you
I was blinded
And I'm still blinded

I walk in the breeze
Like I am seventeen
Love is mostly war
And love what is it for?

I distract myself with other things
To keep myself from you
I'm tired of the others
They never loved you

My life has always been a kind of secret
Can you keep it?
Could you keep it?

I walk in the breeze
Like I am seventeen
Love is mostly war
And love what is it for?

You always say that I look so tough
But it's because I'm tough
