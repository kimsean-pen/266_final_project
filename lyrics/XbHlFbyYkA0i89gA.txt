If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby, I'll carry you all the way home
If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby, I'll carry you all the way home

Everybody's gotta love someone
But, I just wanna love you, dear
Everybody's gotta feel something
I just wanna be with you, my dear
I know it's hard, I know it's hard
I know it's hard to be in this position
If they stop loving you, I won't stop loving you
If they stop needing you, I'll still need you, my dear

If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby, I'll carry you all the way home
If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby, I'll carry you all the way home

You've gotta believe me when I say
When I say the word "forever"
And whatever comes your way
We'll still be here together
I know it's hard, I know it's hard
But I understand you, just take my hand

If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby, I'll carry you all the way home
If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby, I'll carry you all the way home
