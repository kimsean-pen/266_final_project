"Let them curse it, that curse the day
who are skilful to rouse Leviathan"

Cursed one, son of darkness
Hear the call beyond the gate
Open the book of human flesh
The daemons on the other side awaits
Summon the evil forces of the seven lords
Secret seal before your eyes
Call forth the evil gods

Hear the prayers
Master of spells pass through the gate
Bring the world tremendous evil
Realm of chaos awaits
Lords of desolation
See the revelations across the blackened sky
Break the curse
Immortal ones pass through the ancients gate

Worshipper of darkness
Enchanter of the evil one
Beyond the stars lies the gate
Eternally locked from inside
Gaze at the engraved cryptogram
The diabolic sign of entrance
The key to the realm of evil gods
From where the sinful souls shall depart

Master - open the gate of entrance
Reveal the concealed forces of the astral lords
Master - hear the eternal cries
From the dwelling daemons at the other side
