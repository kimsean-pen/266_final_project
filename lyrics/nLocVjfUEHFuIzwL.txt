Last time in my mind
Lets me know that I see only option.
If I want what you want,
They hurt but only on the outside
If I fall, can at least I fall
If I fall, can at least I fall
If I fall, can at least I fall
If I fall, can at least I fall
Towards silence, she has a feeling
Of the man I felt too deceitful. faithless
Bright side of my mind
Lets me know that is the only option.
Ill want, what I want,
It will hurt now, but only on the inside!
If I fall, can at least I fall
If I fall, can at least I fall
If I fall, can at least I fall
If I fall, can at least I fall
Towards silence, she has a feeling
Of the man I felt too deceitful. faithless
