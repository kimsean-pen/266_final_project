Killing me
He's killing me
We killing me
Me killing me
Killing me...

Infectious human waste
Forefather
Cancer
Hunter
Prostate gods

Killer
Killer

A testosterone feeding drone
Multiplying, multiplying hungry clones

Time to
Defy
The hive

Kill your masters!

Menocide!

I.
Our time has come!

You're just as weak as me
But not as strong!
Just as imperfect!
But twice as flawed!

I see your skin
And I hate the way
You look at me!
And softly invade

I'm afraid!
Insane!
Rage intensified!

I'll feel no fear or hate as I
Commit
Menocide!
(Menocide!)

Girls in the playroom
House wives
Servants in the workplace
Slaves to lies!

Rise!
Rise!

II.
Those who refuse to grow
We leave behind
Give death to them!
With an evolved state of mind

No one's listening
Save your cries
Everything they taught
Was a lie

Hear me now, this battlecry
Die! Die!
Concubine!

What to wear
What to eat
What to feel
What to think
How to act
How to speak
Insecure
Incomplete!

Enough!

Apple eater!
Deceiver!
Protector of the way!

This is the beginning of my liberation!
This is the beginning!
Brides and breeders!
Lillith, Eve, Isis, Kali

Give me free!
(Always)
Remember!

Female circumcisions!
Burning!
Like Salem witches!

Never again!
Never again!

No compassion
Kill your masters!
Menocide!

Kill your masters
Kill your masters
Kill your masters
Menocide!
