I'm trying not to pretend
It won't happen again and again like that
I never thought it would end
'Cause you got up in my head, in my head like that
And made me happy, baby, love is crazy, so amazing
But it's changing, re-arranging
I don't think I can take anymore

'Cause the walls burned up when our love fell down
And it turned into whatever, now we're saying never
Feel the fire 'cause it's all around
And it's burning for forever and always
We gotta let it go and be on our way and live for another day
'Cause it ain't the same, my baby
Watch it all fall into the ground
No happy ever after
Just disaster
Woah, ooh, ooh

I didn't want it this way
I only wanted to say I loved you right
But now you're walking away and leaving me here to stay
So foolish of me to wait for you
To realize all the things I gave you, made you, changed you
Your dreams came true when I met you, now forget you
Don't want anymore

'Cause the walls burned up when our love fell down
And it turned into whatever, now we're saying never
Feel the fire 'cause it's all around
And it's burning for forever and always (and always)
You gotta let it go and be on our way and live for another day
'Cause it ain't the same, my baby
Watch it all fall into the ground
No happy ever after
Just disaster

You shot the bullet, you shot the bullet that killed me
Not feeling my heartbeat and now it's dying
I am through it
I-I am through all the agony
And now my eyes are drying, trying, no more crying
Lying's just a game
So disaster strikes and I'm alright
'Cause my love's on its way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Burning up forever and always, always
Yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause the walls burned up when our love fell down
And it turned into whatever, and now we're saying never
Feel the fire 'cause it's all around
And it's burning for forever and always
We gotta let it go and be on our way and live for another day
'Cause it ain't the same, my baby
Watch it all fall into the ground
No happy ever after
Just disaster
'Cause the walls burned up when our love fell down
And it turned into whatever, now we're saying never
Feel the fire 'cause it's all around
And it's burning for forever and always (yeah)
You gotta let it go and be on our way and live for another day (jjust disaster)
'Cause it ain't the same, my baby
Watch it all fall into the ground
No happy ever after
Just disaster (just disaster)
Oh!

Burning up for forever and always, always
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
