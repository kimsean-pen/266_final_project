So it goes
Alcohol takes another soul
Friend or foe
Can't have one, bein' both
On the ropes
Count to ten and I'll be the scapegoat
In the trench
Every night we reminisce

Together
We're narrowly back pedalling
No better
Seeking closure, The Noble Soldier

Evil blends
The terror comes rushin' in
Makin' sense
Is harder and harder to apprehend

Desensitized
By genocide
Take a little pity
If you're not too busy with your pride

Together
We're narrowly back pedalling
No better
Seeking closure, The Noble Soldier

Over and over, seeking closure
Over and over, The Noble Soldier
Over and over takes it's toll
