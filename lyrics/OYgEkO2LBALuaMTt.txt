U and me, U and me (x3)
U and me forever
U and me, U and me (x3)
U and me forever

Babe I must say
You've got me groovy
You keep it going, shake your body with me
Now it is time
Let's start the party
Hear the music, setting me free

Come on, come on, check the dope cut
This one is to move or not
And if ya did came to rock, I'll rock ya
Anyway I can do it with or without ya
Kick off your shoes
Do what you wanna do
And if you ask who
I say "you!"

Now you know what's up
U and me forever non stop

Babe I can see
You're driving me crazy
I wanna jump and jam with you
I can if I please
Play with your feelings
But is the music, setting me free

So don't try to hide, it's showin'
In the way you look, make me known and
I'm on a high grip
Got ya in my grip
On a fast tip sip so don't rip your dip
No pause, knock knock
Get up, get down, get up, you know how, fast
The beat is flowin'
U and me let's keep the jam goin'
