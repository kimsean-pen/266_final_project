Brand new sneakers and a fat gold chain
We do the good cocaine
And we don't feel no pain
So yo, we don't complain
Everywhere I go people know my name
We got the money and fame (ha-ha)
And they don't treat me the same (they don't treat me the same, no)
But yo, I don't complain
Peckerwood status, live since Illmatic
Barnacle static like radical fanatic
Jump out the Benz with a semi-automatic
And rob all my friends like a fucking drug addict
Revolutionary, very necessary
You couldn't bust a cherry, fuck your commentary
I'm so legendary, born again rhymer
Youngsters act scary when they 'round the old timer
Like "Yes, sir. No, sir. Truly, it's an honor"
Farmer of drama, harvesting karma
Kamikaze die bomber on suicide mission
My mental condition 'bout to come to fruition
I'm all natural, no preservative
Style superlative, you don't deserve to live
We never truly die, think I was never born
Tell your vision lies and watch that murder porn
Brand new sneakers and a fat gold chain
We do the good cocaine
And we don't feel no pain
So yo, we don't complain
Everywhere I go people know my name
We got the money and fame
And they don't treat me the same
But yo, I don't complain
(If it feels good!)
I smoke like Willie, party like Waylon
Wilder than David Lee Roth from Van Halen
Batshit crazier than you'll ever hear from Sarah Palin
Here's to smooth sailin' on all these tough waters
Mothers love their sons, fathers love their daughters
All the things they give us and all the things they bought us
The love they first made us and all the thing they taught us
Like doin' unto others, lovin' all your brothers
And helpin' out your neighbors when they need a hand
But everyone went solo, went from thug life to YOLO
And it's hard to tell a woman sometimes from a man
It's a ball of confusion and everybody's losin'
Livin' fake lives up on Instagram
But everything is funny when you front for the money
While the devil executes his fucking masterplan, like
Brand new sneakers and a fat gold chain
We do the good cocaine
And we don't feel no pain
So yo, we don't complain
Everywhere I go people know my name
We got the money and fame
And they don't treat me the same
But yo, I don't complain
