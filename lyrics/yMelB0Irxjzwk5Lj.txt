It's the tearing sound of love-notes drowning out these gray stained windows
And the view outside is sterile, and I'm only two cubes down
I'd photocopy all the things that we could be if you took the time to notice me
But you can't now, I don't blame you, and it's not your fault that no one ever does

But you don't work here anymore it's just a vacant three by four
And they might fill your place, a temporary stand-in for your face
This happens all the time, and I can't help but think I'll die alone

So I'll spend my time with strangers
A condition and it's terminal
In this water-cooler romance, and it's coming to a close
We could be in the park and dancing by a tree, kicking over blades we see
Or a dark beach with a black view, and pin-pricks in the velvet catch our fall

But you don't work here anymore it's just a vacant three by four
And they might fill your place, a temporary stand-in for your face
This happens all the time, and I can't help but think I'll die alone

I know you don't work here anymore Sometimes I think I'll die alone, sometimes I think I'll die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone, live and breathe and die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone, sometimes I think I'll die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone, I'd think I'd love to die alone

Just take
I think I'd love to die
Me down
I think I'd love to die
Just take
I think I'd love to die
Me down
I think I'd love to die alone Live and breathe and die alone
I think I'd love to die alone I think I'd love to die alone
