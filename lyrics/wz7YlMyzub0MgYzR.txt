This street is haunted like a beast
That doesn't know its face is frightening to behold
All the painted little gnomes
Smiling in a line, tryna get your votes

There's an architect setting fire to her house
All the plans were there
But they built it inside out
No one will endure
What the sign told them they would
Beware of the dogs
Beware of the dogs

My home, carpet on the stairs
Everyone in bed, their eyes are white as clouds
Next door, sounds like bloody war
Waiting for the phone, telling us to run

There's an architect setting fire to her house
All the plans were there
But they built it inside out
No one will endure
What the sign told them they would
Beware of the dogs
beware of the dogs

There's no Parliament worthy of this country's side
All these pious fucks taking from the '99
Now we'll all endure
What the sign told us we would
Beware of the dogs
Beware of the dogs
