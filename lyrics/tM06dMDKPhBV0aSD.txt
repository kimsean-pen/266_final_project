Northern forms existed in their own homes
Thousand - Yellow - Cocoons
Under - Over - Through

A few southern vegetable forms on the mountains of Borneo
Under - Over - Through
Donkey - Peacock - Goose

In the mouth of the river
Strange - Scene - It is
Every - Thing - In flames

The sky with lightning and the water, luminous
A strange - Scene - It is
Under - Over - Through

Six weeks old Henrietta smiled for the first time
Tail - Habits - Proof
Instinct - That - Moves

Emma saw him smile not only with lips but eyes
Erasmus - Grab - A spoon
Europe - Hides - Wool

Mr Peacock and Captain Beaufort
Endemic - Alpine - Grooves
Bread-fruit - Cinnamon - Tunes

Tonight it's blowing thick bodies of spray whirled across the bay
Whatever - Might - Have been
The cause - Of the - Retreat

Columbia livia
Great ages through
Course of days
Tumblers, Jacobins
Beak shapes, skeletal traits
Runts and Carriers
Wooden hexagonal cage
Pouters and Fantails
Tail feathers at what age?
(The delight of once again being home)
Grey and white spotted
(The delight of once again being home)
Markings in making
(The delight of once again being home)
My great amusement
Behind Land house a gentle cooing
Behind Land house the offspring's moving
Behind Land house a gentle cooing

The delight of once again being home
The delight of once again being home
The delight of once again being home
The delight of once again being home
The delight of once again being home
The delight of once again being home
