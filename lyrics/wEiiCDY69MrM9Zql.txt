Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

(Here we go)
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh
We got problems, we don't know how to solve them
Everywhere we go, we got some skeletons to follow
We got baggage, you know we're gonna drag it
Everywhere we go, for everyone to see in the
Broken hearts parade

And I'm putting my heart out on display

There's no masquerade
Just a funeral march for love today
The band strikes up and they're playing a song
Dressed in black and we're singing along to the

Broken hearts parade
I've never been better than I am today
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
You got a question
How do we get it started?

I got an answer, let go of your heart and
Love it, live it, leave it and get into it

If you wanna start it
This is how you do it, in the
Broken hearts parade
And I'm putting my heart out on display
There's no masquerade
Just a funeral march for love today

The band strikes up and they're playing a song
Dressed in black and we're singing along to the
Broken hearts parade
And I've never been better than I am today
I used to lie awake at night and
Wonder when she's coming home
It used to be so hard to wake up everyday
The broken hearts parade
And we're putting our hearts out on display
There's no masquerade
Just a funeral march for love today
The band strikes up and they're playing a song
Dressed in black and we're singing along to the
Broken hearts parade
And I've never been better than I am today
March on to the sound
The beating of a broken heart
Step with the rhythm you found
To the beating of the broken heart
