Riverbered dry creek
These clouds are just dust
You better stay indoors
Like always

I'll never remember the things we did
I'll never remember the things I said
I made a promise
To that end
It was empty from Long Beach to Long Island

Even mosquitoes have their own blood
The hope that I'll become a living thing has me lying in wait
But I don't have the strenght I thought I did
But I don't have the strenght I thought I did

I'll never remember the things we did
I'll never remember the things I said
I made a promise
To that end
It was empty from Long Beach to Long Island

But I don't have the strenght I thought I did
