Can a man be so blind
That his vision can be mine
'Cause the shore won't draw the line
When water rides in with the tide

And for once I am driftin'
But not on my own
And now I'm right I should've been
Here with you all alone

Open me and delete
All those nights I was weak
I gave up while you held it down
You're so hip but I know
That your heart's gettin' cold
I'm holdin' tight, it's gettin' real now

'Cause I can't lose you
'Cause I care for you
I care to lose you
I care for you
I care for you
I care for you

Sometimes I don't ask for help
And you don't wanna open up
And when you see my tears right now
You won't need to clean 'em up

All these evil words
Usin' them to stab me
Even though it hurts
You can throw 'em at me baby
It takes a man to admit he messed up
But girl you gotta be fair

'Cause I can't lose you
'Cause I care for you
I care to lose you
I care for you
I care for you
I care for you, yeah

Open me and delete
All those nights I was weak
And you held it down
You're so hip but I know
That your heart's gettin' cold
It's gettin' real now
All these evil words
Usin' them to stab me
Even though it hurts
You can throw 'em at me
'Cause I can't lose you baby

I can't lose you
'Cause I care for you
I care to lose you
I care for you
I care for you
I care for you, yeah
