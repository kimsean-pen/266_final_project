Lifecycles and planned obsolescence
A perfect trap disguised as assistance
It takes the pain away, it takes the pain away
Control the sentience of the masses
Relief replaced with silent disaster
But I won't fade away, no, I won't fade away

I defy this hopelessness
I defy your callousness
I defy irreverent
I will rise, I see through your disguise and all your lies
I defy, defy
I defy

A numbing cure for the common existence
To trade security for subsistence
It takes the pain away, it takes the pain away
Victimize, enable, beguile
A body count without a reprisal
But I won't fade away, no, I won't fade away

I defy this hopelessness
I defy your callousness
I defy irreverent
I will rise, I see through your disguise and all your lies
I defy

Sometimes the pain of life's too much to mitigate
But I refuse to march into an early grave
I refuse to march into an early grave

I defy this hopelessness
I defy your callousness
I defy irreverent
I will rise, I see through your disguise and all your lies
I defy

Defy
Defy
Defy
I defy
