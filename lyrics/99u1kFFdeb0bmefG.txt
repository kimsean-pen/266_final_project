Well, I don't own a bar
I can't punch nothing
And sometimes I just wanna bang someone out
The days are long, inside I scream
At some of these people they've given me
And sometimes I just wanna bang someone out
Yards in green don't go, they don't look right round ere'
The lanes ain't Donkey Kong on scumbag game
I get it posh, why should I leave?
The dirty tea bag, I don't want a key
And sometimes I just wanna knock someone out

The plague rolls down from the hills up there
It's fit for work if it can shit and stare
This is how it's gone on in the United Kingdom
The plague rolls down from the hills up there
It's fit for work if it can shit and stare
This is how it's gone on in the United Kingdom
Won't ya

New heart
New eyes
New vision

The Change.orgs go slow
They don't sit right, oh, dear
The door is always closed
You're thinking wrong
The righteous gobbing sincerity
And this medieval constituency
I'm just so dry, I wanna bang someone out

The plague rolls down from the hills up there
It's fit for work if it can shit and stare
This is how it's gone on in the United Kingdom
The plague rolls down from the hills up there
It's fit for work if it can shit and stare
This is how it's gone on in the United Kingdom
Won't ya

New heart
New eyes
New vision
New heart
New eyes
New vision
New heart
New eyes
New vision
