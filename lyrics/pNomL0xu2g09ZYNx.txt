When you see that ship
It is the ship you can't see
When the grey ship calls
It is calling for me
I thought it would come from
I thought it would come from further North than that
Blue sky is silver blue
Sky is grey when the grey ship calls
I am leaving today
I thought it would come
I thought it would come
When you see that ship
It is the ship you can't see
I, I felt that it calling
Is it calling for me?
I thought it would come from
I thought it would come from
I thought it would come from further North than that
My mother with soft hands
My sister, my brother
My best friend from long time
(?)
These strangers with (?)
(?)
I feel all them calling
I surf now on air
I hear all them calling
And I surf on air
We've all gone together
We've all gone to sea
I hear them calling
I hear a symphony
[x4]
I hear them calling
I hear all them calling (?)
We've all gone together
We've all gone to sea
I hear it calling
I hear a symphony
My great-great-grandmother lived on a prairie
Nothing and nothing and nothing and nothing
I got the same feeling inside of me
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
