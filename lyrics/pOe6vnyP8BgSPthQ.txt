Why must all the people keep on shooting and robbing. Why? Why must must all the people keep on killing and fighting. No, not I. I and I will would never try. No, not I. I and I would never try. And why must the rich man keep on hoarding all his money. And why must the this poor man, my living ain't very funny. No, not I. I and I would never try. No not I. I and I would never try, try to live that way. And what did Jah show them. I and I survive. They tried to stop this nation. But I and I survive. To chant down creation, I and I survive. And once again a nation.
