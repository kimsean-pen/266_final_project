I don't think I can remember in my entire life another time just like this.
Never did it before, never been so unsure, this is a special moment.
I don't know what to do whenever something is new I always seem to forget,
I can't make sense of the way, the words that I want to say, and lose them all in my head.

Ready, or not, but here I come,
Lured me right out of where I'm from,
I'll look around and wait to see,
Whatever works its way to be.

I don't think that I could ever be prepared to discover something perfectly new,
But the desire to know makes it curious, so I guess I'm kind of amused.
And it's just the thought that maybe understanding so vaguely is the way it should be,
If it's a mystery still and always has that appeal, perhaps that's better, really.

Ready, or not, but here I come,
Lured me right out of where I'm from.
I'll look around and wait to see,
Whatever works its way to be.

I don't think I can remember in my entire life another time just like this,
Don't understand what I feel, can't pick out if it is real, this is a special moment
