Oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oooh
They're all just the same when I look from far away
And you ask me to stay but I'd rather let this fade
But I'm on your side
But I'm on your side
But I'm on your side
I am on your side
And my mind's already made cause I'm different anyway
And you ask me to stay but I'd rather let this fade
But I'm on your side
But I'm on your side
But I'm on your side
I am on your side
Oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oooh
But I'm on your side
But I'm on your side
But I'm on your side
(Oh-oh-oh-oooh)
I am on your side
(Oh-oh-oh-oooh).
