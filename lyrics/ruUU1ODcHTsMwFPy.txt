Hey I've been freaking out
Cause I can't keep it up and I'm scared
I wanna tell you but it's just like a cross to bear
Just like a cross to bear
I ride the lightning like I'm nineteen
And I'm barely aware
It's like a cross to bear
Just like a cross to bear
They wanna talk about my sin
They wanna say I've lost my shit
I'm losing my religion
And I just can't get over it, over it
I keep on hearing evil voices, voices
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
They keep on messing with my choices, choices
I keep on telling them
Hey, God didn't give me alternatives, no
When she put me on the earth
God didn't make me like girls
God didn't make me like
You see me freaking out
I'm thinking I might do something dumb
I wanna tell you and I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
Go on, give up on me
I think my father still loves his son
I tried to kill myself and I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
You wanna talk about my sin
You wanna say I'm losing it, losing it
I keep on hearing evil voices, voices
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
They keep on messing with my choices, choices
I keep on telling them
Hey, God didn't give me alternatives, no
When she put me on the earth
God didn't make me like girls
God didn't make me like you
Gay's not a challenge that I'll overcome
Not a thing to be tolerated
If I kiss a boy in public is that cool?
Am I fucking up your day? Now that's just rude
I can tell it was an issue God, God, God, God
You unfriended me from Facebook
But we never really talked
I'm not even angry anymore, I'm not even angry anymore
Hey I've been freaking out
Cause I can't keep it up and I'm scared
I wanna tell you but it's just like a cross to bear
Just like a cross to bear
I keep on hearing evil voices, voices
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
They keep on messing with my choices, choices
I keep on telling them
Oh, God didn't give me alternatives, no
When she put me on the earth
God didn't make me like girls
God didn't make me like you
