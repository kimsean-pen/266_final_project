Forget the flood
When I was out praying in the yard
Listening for forever
Drag the carpets out into the sun
Don't you get lonely yeah
Don't you get angry yeah

Stay up
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Until your friends come out
Stay up
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Until your friends come out
Stay up
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Until your friends come out

You heard the cry
And you want to cry back
You heard the cry
And you want to cry back
And you want to cry back
And you want to cry back

Forget the flood
When I was out trying to be someone
Listening for forever
Drag my body down into the sun
Don't you get lonely yeah
Don't you get angry yeah

Stay up
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Stay up
Until your friends come out
Hanging (stay up)
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Around
Until your friends come out
Wasting (stay up)
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
My time with you
Until your friends come out

You heard the cry
And you want to cry back
You heard the cry
And you want to cry back

You want to be held
You want a reaction, baby
Go make yourself good
We're all singing for ya
There's always something
Out there swaying
Go make yourself quiet
If you want to move with it
Oh you want to move with it
Do you want to move with it

Stay up
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Stay up
Until your friends come out
Hanging (stay up)
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Around
Until your friends come out
Wasting (stay up)
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
My time with you
Until your friends come out
