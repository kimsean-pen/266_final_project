Fix my heart
Leave me on the floor
Hurts like hell
She's a painkiller

Woke up on the bedroom floor
With a bottle rocket in my hand
Strung out and I'm almost gone
But I'm coming after you again

And it was nice to meet ya
I'm coming to see ya
Walking the streets after midnight
Feel my bloodstream
Halloween daydream
Baby, come make me alright
Whoa, it's a long, long way down

Fix my heart
Leave me on the floor
Hurts like hell
She's a painkiller
Fill my lungs
Make me beg for more
Keep me numb
She's a painkiller

Backed out by the city glow
And the sun's not coming yet
No way I'm coming clean
You're the demon in my bed

And it was nice to meet ya
You were the fever
Driving alone in your black car
Hardly breathing
Down on my knees
And sinking alone till I see dark
Whoa, it's a long, long way down

Fix my heart
Leave me on the floor
Hurts like hell
She's a painkiller
Fill my lungs
Make me beg for more
Keep me numb
She's a painkiller

Whoa, it's a long, long way down

Fix my heart
Leave me on the floor
Hurts like hell
She's a painkiller
Fill my lungs
Make me beg for more
Keep me numb
She's a painkiller

Fix my heart
Leave me on the floor
Hurts like hell
She's a painkiller
Fill my lungs
Make me beg for more
Keep me numb
She's a painkiller
