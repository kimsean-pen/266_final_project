Seems like no one is surprising
Anymore, it's not that I'm
Ungrateful, I'm just a little bored
Sure I'm self sufficient blah blah
Independent. Truthfully I've got
Some space. I want that
Man to fill it

Don't need another friend
Let's say for instance
And as a rule
I don't believe
Don't do long distance
So I'm looking for a sailor or an arson expert
Someone I can tell them, say

I want to be blown away
Blow me away
I want to be blown away
I want to be blown away
Blow me away
I want to be blown away

I know I don't look it
But I can cook
I'm really pretty simple I
Like what I should
You'd think it be really easy
If it was I would
But people seem too crazy
So I read a book

I don't want to send a search party
If he's smart I can wait
And he'll find me
So for now. I'll just say what
I'm lookin' for, one more time

I want to be blown away
Blow me away
I want to be blown away
I want to be blown away
Blow me away
I want to be blown away
Blow me away
I want to be blown away
