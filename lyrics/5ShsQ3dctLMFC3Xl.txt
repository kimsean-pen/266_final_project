I got a window
I'm trying to live inside
I got a lover
And she's kind of kind
She got a feeling
Like I'm somebody else
I'm gonna run with that
Until I let her know
I'm not a body
I'm just a soul

High on the buzz
Trying to separate
You are the pulse
You the falling rain

Don't stop, don't stop believing
Time stop, you'd better believe it
When the day is almost over
And the clouds are in the sea
When my life has all been lived
Even though I didn't love you
You made me believe

Da da da da
Da da da da
In love
Da da da da
Da da da da

Black widow
Crawling down my spine
I wanna break free
I wanna stay alive
I got a feeling
Like I'm somebody else
I'm gonna run with that
Until I let her know
I'm not a body
I'm just a soul

High on the buzz
Trying to separate
You are the pulse
You the falling rain

Don't stop, don't stop believing
Time stop, you'd better believe it
When the day is almost over
And the clouds are in the sea
When my life has all been lived
Even though I didn't love you
You made me believe

In love
In love
In love

Don't stop, don't stop believing
Time stop, you'd better believe it
When the day is almost over
And the clouds are in the sea
When my life has all been lived
Even though I didn't love you
You made me believe

Da da da da
Da da da da
In love
Da da da da
Da da da da
