Someone to care
someone to share
lonely hours and moments of despair
to be loved, to be loved
oh what a feeling to be loved

Someone to kiss
someone to miss
when you're away
to here for me today
to be love, to be loved
oh what a feeling to be loved

Some wish to be a king or a queen
some wish for fortune and fame
but to be, truly, truly, truly loved is
more than all of these things

Someone to kiss
someone to miss
when you're away to here for me today
to be loved, to be love, to be love
oh what a feeling to be loved
to be loved, to be loved, oh what a feeling
to be loved
