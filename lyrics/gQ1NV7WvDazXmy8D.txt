14 years 30 minutes 15 seconds I've held this grudge
11 songs 4 full journals, thoughts of punishment I've expended

not in contact not a letter such communication telepathic
you've been vilified, used as fodder, you deserve a piece of every record

but who's it hurting now?
Who's the one that's stuck?
Who's it torturing now, with an antique knot in her stomach

I want to be big and let go of this grudge that's grown old
All this time i've not known how to rest this bygone
I want to be soft and resolved clean of slate and released
I want to forgive for the both of us

Like an abandoned house dusty-covered furniture still intact
If I visit it now, do I simply re-live it somehow gratuitous

But who's still aching now?
Who's tired of her own voice?
Who's it weighing down with no gift from time of said healing

I want to be big and let go of this grudge that's grown old
All this time i've not known how to rest this bygone
I want to be soft and resolved clean of slate and released
I want to forgive for the both of us

Maybe as i cut the cord veils will lift from my eyes
Maybe as i lay this to rest dead weight off my shoulders will rise

Here i sit, much determined ever ill-equipped to draw this curtain
How this has entertained, validated and has served me greatly ever the victim

But who's done whining now?
Who's ready to put down
This load I've carried longer than I had cared to remember

I want to be big and let go of this grudge that's grown old
For the life of me I've not known how to rest this bygone
I want to be soft and resolved clean of slate and released
