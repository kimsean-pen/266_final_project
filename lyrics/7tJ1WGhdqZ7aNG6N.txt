This is what I thought you said
Talking on the phone
Just walk away
And cry
Cause so long

The holidays we spent will fade
Now that I've been gone
Just remember
That we met
You're still at home

Listen to the voice that says alright
This is start and not the end tonight

You said that?
Reach across the sky
? the windows
We stay
But not at home

Times like this you wonder why
It's even worth your while
Just count the silence
These days
Until you smile

Listen to the voice that says alright
This is start and not the end tonight

Listen to the voice that says alright
This is start and not the end tonight
