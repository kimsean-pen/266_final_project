When the sign of the time
Is the time when are extremely tough
Shhhh
When you look ate the World and The World that you see is
Yes Rouht
When you feel like a long last pup and you need some cheering up
Sit back relax

And watch do our stuff
We're gonna sit and shake your hand that how it's starts
We're gonna nose our nosey way into your hearts
We're sing and bark in two part harmony
Me and my boi
My boi and me

We make the perfect pair

We've got that savoir-faire
And any bound you throw will catch it in mid air
We're gonna find a part to sing our tape in two
We're gonna jump through hoops and get a great review
When next issue is sonny nominee
They gotta love us that's our guarantee
We're bow together on the count of three
Me and my boi
My boi and me
We make the perfect pair
We even got that said were there
Me and my boi
Me and my boi
Me and my boi
My boi and me
