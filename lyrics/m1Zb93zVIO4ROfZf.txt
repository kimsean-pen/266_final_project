subtle as a ghost
you surround the very space I'm in
determine the shape I'm in
and I'm faced with
a sudden scare

it's everywhere

subtle as a ghost
you derange this maze I'm in
agitate this race I'm in
and I'm faced with
a sudden scare

it's everywhere

as roads collide and I with them
madness manifests itself
though I feel alive for an instant
numbness is closing in

I wear the marks of this feeling
I wear the marks of this feeling
and I'll bear it

an abandoned car radio cries
my soul is in pretty good shape and so am I

as roads collide and I with them
madness manifests itself
though I feel alive for an instant
numbness is closing in

I wear the marks of this feeling
I wear the marks of this feeling
and I'll bear it
