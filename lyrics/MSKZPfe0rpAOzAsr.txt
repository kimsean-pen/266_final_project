Hey, you
I'm not bold or cool or masculine
Maybe you're just waiting for the perfect Latin lover to walk in
(I'm not him)

Between my penis and my chin
Is camembert and shame
I used to be elegantly thin
I'm sorry babe, we both missed that train

No, if I follow you all your girlfriends will know
Then I'll line up with the other fools
Wasting, wasting his time
Following you 'round
Another lonely guy with longing in his eye
But you said your man is bringing you down

Someone sweep me off my feet
I am not an angel, I'm barely a man
I'm lonely but I'm here, baby understand
Someone sweep me off my feet

Someone sweep me off my feet
I am not an angel, I'm barely a man
I'm lonely but I'm here, baby understand
Someone sweep me off my feet
