The moment that hope is something you don't notice anymore
You watch as one door closes, is this what you're supposed to settle for
You're losing the fight now, every single time

When you're feeling like you're folding
Just pretend you're floating on it all
I know not everything is golden
But take it off your shoulders, let it fall
Reach out into the dark, no, see how many others there are

What if we were never meant to glow, maybe we'll never know
We'll stay forever if we don't go, but maybe we're home
Your eyes still shine, heart still beating
No more truth to find, just believe in me
And the storm inside is just your breathing, but maybe we're home

When all the little moments stick to you like omens, heavy weight
Well you don't have to hold them
You can just let go and slip away
Run for your life, no, we're leaving nothing behind

What if we were never meant to glow,
Maybe we'll never know
We'll stay forever if we don't go
But maybe we're home
Your eyes still shine, heart still beating
No more truth to find, just believe in me
The storm inside is just your breathing
But maybe we're home

We found the rain, but if we start to peel away the grey
Maybe we're home
We found the rain, but if we start to peel away the grey
Maybe we're home
We found the rain, but if we start to peel away the grey
Maybe we're home
We found the rain, but if we start to peel away the grey
Maybe we're home

What if we were never meant to
Glow, maybe we'll never know
We'll stay forever if we don't go,
But maybe we're home
Your eyes still shine, heart still beating
No more truth to find, just believe in me
And the storm inside is just your breathing,
But maybe we're home
