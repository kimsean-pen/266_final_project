The wind blows through your hair
As you're walking people stare
Up the block and down the street to North King's highway

And there's a beating in my chest
And it's seeming to suggest
That before this day is through it might go my way

And so I sit back in my seat
I scribble down something that's sweet about a boy
A girl
An endless stretch of scenery

'Cause it's like falling to your knees before a stranger on the street
I did it just the other day
You should have seen me

Oh
And I wanna remember this night
And how my words never came out right
It's just my patience that keeps me alive
Just like all those pretty lights
Just like all the pretty lights in the sky

There's something to be said about the colors in your head
And how they mix to form the perfect shade of sadness

Not because of things I've done or any of the songs I've sung
It's just the story of our lives
We wish we had this

Oh
And I wanna remember this night
And how my words never came out right
It's just my patience that keeps me alive
Just like all those pretty lights

Just like all the pretty lights in the sky

And I remember we stayed up way past your bedtime
Up on the second floor
Down by my sliding door

Just innocent kids in a victimless crime
Trapped in a metaphor
Hoping for something more

And I wanna remember this night
And how my words never came out right
It's just my patience that keeps me alive
Oh
Just like all those pretty lights
Just like all the pretty lights in the sky

Oh
And I wanna remember this night
And how my words never came out right
It's just my patience that keeps me alive
Oh
Just like all those pretty lights
Just like all the pretty lights in the sky

In the sky
Just like all those pretty lights
Just like all the pretty lights in the sky

In the sky
Just like all those pretty lights
Just like all the pretty lights in the sky
