Everyday I look at you and I can't believe the view
Lying there next to me
It always feels brand new
Busy streets, packed out bars
Taxi cabs and cars
Life is fast
But we last
Still together

What we have is beautiful
If I lost you, then I'd lose it all
'Cause this world would be empty without you oo ooo
It scares me that this life would be nothing without you oo ooo
Someday we'll have to say goodbye and
I need to let you know that I will
never try to fill this space between
It'll only ever be
You and me

Candle light, a glass of wine, a dinner made for two
All the noise of the city
Are drowning out for you
Then we kiss as we dance, I hope this feeling lasts forever
Life is fast, raise a glass we are still together

And you're still so beautiful
If I lost you, then I'd lose it all
'Cause this world would be empty without you oo ooo
It scares me that this life would be nothing without you oo ooo
Someday we'll have to say goodbye
I need to let you know that I will
never try to fill this space between
It'll only ever be
You and me

And you're still so beautiful
If I lost you, then I'd lose it all
'Cause this world would be empty without you oo ooo
It scares me that this life would be nothing without you oo ooo
Wo oh, someday we'll have to say goodbye
I need to let you know that I will
never try to fill this space between
It'll only ever be
You and me
