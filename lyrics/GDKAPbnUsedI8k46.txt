My friend I need a little help
To fend the darkness at the end
Of all this, I thought that I had fought it
But like clockwork it seems to keep on coming
Oh dear, you saw me on a night when I was pissed
And I tried to act alright, smooth talking
I'm not sure you bought it
So I'm crawling to the nearest taxi

So, let it out
I need a little something and I can't seem to get it
Now, love, help me now
I got a lot of questions and I can't seem to get them out

Let's pretend that we had never met
So then it's fair when we are getting it on Sunday
I know that that's a fun day
To remember 'til I see you next, yeah

So, let it out
I need a little something and I can't seem to get it
Now, love, help me now
I got a lot of questions and I can't seem to get them out

This must be the memory
Where you took that photograph of me
Don't act so embarrassed
We all do dumb thing's when we're lonely
You know my heart deeply
But we don't talk about that, do we?
And hold your wife like a silence

So, let it out
I need a little something and I can't seem to get it
Now, love, help me now
I got a lot of questions and I can't seem to get them out

So, let it out
I need a little something and I can't seem to get it
Now, love, help me now
I got a lot of questions and I can't seem to get them
I can't seem to get them
I can't seem to get them
I can't seem to get them out
