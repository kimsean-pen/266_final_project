There's a shadow in the things that you do,
There's a message on a table for two
I can read it but can't read it to you
It was written by an Angel above, in the shadow of the city you love
It's where I told you I was born in blood
You died before the chorus, sick and tired of waiting for us
We took too long to come and sing, our songs to you mean everything so
You went straight to heaven, carved on your arms seven seven seven
I wish you could've made it through,
but I understand it's not what you do so well,
Anymore
I see the faces of the people you hate,
they fucking love it when you make a mistake
But how much suffering can one person take?
It's too much money and it's not
even good, ain't funny nobody understood
Never buy it till you checked underneath the hood
You die before the chorus, sick and tired of waiting for us
We took too long to come and sing, our songs to you mean everything so
You went straight to heaven, craved on your arms seven seven seven
I wish you could've made it through,
but I understand it's not what you do so well,
Anymore
I'll goto hell and close the door, on my way out of this war
Don't say farewell - See you in hell
If I play chorus will you promise to die,
if I play chorus will you promise to die
If I play chorus will you promise to die
