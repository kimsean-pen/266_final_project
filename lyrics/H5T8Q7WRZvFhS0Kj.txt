It's like we're going cuckoo
Me and you, stuck in a time machine
That was just a dream
Just go down
Just go down
I'd like to reach your mind
Can you hear mine
It's also very cuckoo
Me and you
We never meant obsession
We should have high confessions
This feels so out of time
Walk and left behind.
Just go down
Just go down
Ah ah ah ah ...
