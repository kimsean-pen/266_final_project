These walls of time release
My eyes move like the drift
The cries, they resonate within
The fabric tears before me break ties between the kin

Reaching for a way out of this dream
I waste my breath ascending
Fears lead me astray
The past brings them to be
What's left to carry me

But a memory
The dream endures these lies
Forever at the edge left surviving alone

Reaching for a way out of this dream
I waste my breath ascending
Fears lead me astray
The past brings them to be
What's left to carry me

What's left as I wander
I've found a world where I am free
Inside that which is truth

The ground upon which I have grown is not the same
The fears they've fallen away
Presently I've found I am not alone
In a world of infinity sewn

(Perceive within ourselves)

Perceive beyond the seam
Beyond the seam
A soul evolves as well
