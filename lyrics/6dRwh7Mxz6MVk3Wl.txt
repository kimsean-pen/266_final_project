Don't quiver little boy, your daddy's with you now
It won't be long anyhow
It's just around the corner
The destiny that I embrace with you

Oh, don't get too close to my fantasy
Don't be afraid to clutch the hand of your creator
Stare into the lion's eyes and if you taste the candy
You'll get to the surprise

Stay calm little dreamer and drift off into dreams
The gentle kiss of night is better than it seems
It's just around the corner
Close your eyes and soon you'll be with me

Oh, don't get too close to my fantasy
Don't be afraid to clutch the hand of your creator
Stare into the lion's eyes and if you taste the candy
You'll get to the surprise, oh

Don't get too close to my fantasy
Don't be afraid to clutch the hand of your creator
Stare into the lion's eyes and if you taste the candy
You'll get to the surprise

Oh, don't get too close to my fantasy
Don't be afraid to clutch the hand of your creator
Stare into the lion's eyes and if you taste the candy
You'll get to the surprise, oh
