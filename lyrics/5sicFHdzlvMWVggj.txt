fast spreading disease
wasting away for a meaningless deathkey
slow dawning, minds sleep
hypnotized drones of an imminent decree

we bury our last hopes with ease
we're all a part of this violentry machine
no running, no sanctuary
there is no feeling from this imminent
decree

over the borders, across the lines
we are bridging this void malign
the data speaks, we make our time
we are bridging this void malign

infection, increased
wasting away for a meaningless deathkey
slow dawning, minds sleep
hypnotized drones of an imminent decree

we bury our last hopes with ease
we're all a part of this violentry machine
no running, no sanctuary
there is no feeling from this imminent
decree

over the borders, across the lines
we are bridging this void malign
the data speaks, we make our time
we are bridging this void malign
