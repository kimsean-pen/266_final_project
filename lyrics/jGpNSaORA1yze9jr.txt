honey,
it's been a long time coming,
and i can't stop now
such a long time running,
and i can't stop now
do you hear my heart beating?
can you hear that sound?
'cause i can't help thinking
that i don't look down

and then i looked up at the sun
and i could see
oh, the way that gravity turns for you and me
and then i looked up at the sky
and saw the sun
and the way that gravity pulls on everyone
on everyone

baby,
it's been a long time waiting,
such a long, long time
and i can't stop smiling,
oh i can't stop now
but do you hear my heart beating?
ah can you hear that sound?
'cause i can't help crying
and i won't look down

and then i looked up at the sun
and i could see
oh, the way that gravity turns on you and me
and then i looked up at the sun
and saw the sky
and the way that gravity pulls on you and i
on you and i
