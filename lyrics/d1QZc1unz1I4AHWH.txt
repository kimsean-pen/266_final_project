When you sing of the joy only love can bring
Heaven knows, it's in my heart and my soul

We're caught in a world full of tears
So many sad times and fears
So while there's a chance and you're near

Well, let's dance
Yeah, yeah, let's dance
Ah, yeah

There's a world far away from the one we see
There's a dream I will never let go

One thing is certainly true
This moment's for me and for you
While there's not a thing that we can do

Well, let's dance
Yeah, yeah, let's dance
Ah, yeah, yeah

Well, let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance

Let's dance
Well, let's dance
Ah, let's dance

Let's dance
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's dance
Ah, let's dance

Well, let's dance
Yeah, yeah
Let's dance
Let's dance
Ah, yeah
