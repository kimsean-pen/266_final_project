Are you still doin' time?
Fun until we cry
Well what you have in mind?
Don't you want your life back on track?
I just want my friend
and maybe lend a hand
Can we make amends?
we used to talk from night 'til morning
Sad for me, no more apologies
things that I can't unsee

So lie to me, i miss you
So lie to me, I miss you

Why you tell lies,
I heard a million times
Don't wanna spend my time
down and up, out off my mind
It's hard to see
rumoured apologies
Things that I can't unsee

Lie to me, I miss you
Lie to me, I miss you
so lie to me, I miss you

What if I held you down
when you're burnin'
when you're burnin'
with the siren
What if I told a lie
you heard
will you heard your psych eye?
when you burnin
when you burnin'
were you hurt?
were you hurt...

It's hard to see
rumoured apologies
Things that I can't unsee

so lie to me, I miss you
