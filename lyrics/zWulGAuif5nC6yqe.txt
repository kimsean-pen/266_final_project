I'm a lover I'm not a fighter,
Hold me close and I'll take you higher than you've ever been,
Raise your hands and lay down your weapons,
We could turn this around in seconds flat,
If you believe.

Home is where the heart is,
It's where we started,
Where we belong, singing.
Home is where the heart is,
It's where we started,
Where we belong.

Light a fire and write a sonnet,
Pin your hopes and your dreams upon it now, come and sing with us
Calling out to your children's children,
Let there be love and let them scream it loud,
Before we bite the dust.

So come on,
Home is where the heart is,
It's where we started,
Where we belong
and sing it
Home is where the heart is,
It's where we started,
Where we belong.

In these troubled days of anger,
We're afraid of every stranger,
But today we're changing history,
It's OK to sing it with me

Now's your chance think of your lovers,
We are all sisters and brothers.
Now's your chance think of your lovers,
We are all sisters and brothers.

Home, home

Home is where the heart is,
It's where we started,
Where we belong

Home is where the heart is,
It's where we started,
Where we belong
(Repeat to fade)
