A pretty man with a lot of hobbies
I can see right through you
I can hold your interest but only for a short time
And it feels freeing to lose

It's obvious
It's obvious
It's obvious
I'm stuck on it

Kill time in between the fake lies
Then gain a sense of self
Try to get to a place of stillness
Wonder what it feels like not to care

It's obvious
It's obvious
It's obvious
I'm stuck on it
