Forcing my way out of the pack
Losing my strength on the way
Losing sight of you

My place was burnt, already lost
Nothing holds me back in there
Nothing holds me back

But you were mine
And i was gone
In the shine
Until you drown
You were lost, not alone
You were lost, so typical

Forcing my way out of the mess
I will find somewhere to rise
I will find someone

But you were mine
And i was gone
In the shine
Until you drown
You were lost, not alone
You were lost, so typical

My place was burnt, already lost
Nothing holds me back in there

But you were mine
And i was gone
In the shine
Until you drown
You were lost, not alone
You were lost, so typical
