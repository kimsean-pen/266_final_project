Against the mind, the boreal sceptres
Hissing hollowly, gnawing rocks
Boulder shield dispersed by ice
Wailing souls threshed by nature's temptress

Where to find their shelter
Where to find their sparks
Where to build and live
And returns the sun's energy
...Once again
...Boreal fiends
Rest your shoulders and take in
Your cold and lonely dreams

Some witnessed the birth of pine
There was game to be had
Some died alone under the stars
For all this we are grateful

Where to find their shelter
Where to find their sparks
Where to build and live
And returns the sun's energy
...Once again
...Boreal fiends

Rest your shoulders and take in
Your cold and lonely dreams
