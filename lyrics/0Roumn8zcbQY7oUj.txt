Watching the ships roll in
Hoping that I, will still be his friend, in the morning
Watching those ships roll by
Wishing that I, could move this earth
If i could, for you i would do

I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to lay at your feet
I just keep hoping, hoping, you will be the man
That I couldn't be

Still watching the ocean move
If only I could show you my soul
And places I've been
Watching the ocean curl
And little girls playing in the sand, as I walk
Longing to listen to you talk

But I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to lay at your feet
I just keep hoping, hoping, you will be the man
That I couldn't be

I got nothing to say
I got nothing to lay at your feet
I just keep hoping, hoping, you be the man
That I couldn't be
