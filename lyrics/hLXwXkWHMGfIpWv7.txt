They tore me down
They threw me out
They shot my mouth

They enslaved my mind
They blocked my way
Holding me back with
Their stupid game

Hand on trigger
Phantom face
Don't trust no one
Always on the run
Eyes all over
Never safe
Virus like
Merciless

I left the row
Erased myself
Designed my plan

Now I revolt
I just say no
I do reject
And don't let it go

I serve the revolution
In a different way
My thoughts are radical
And I don't hesitate to slay

Hand on trigger
Phantom face
Don't trust no one
Always on the run
Eyes all over
Never safe
Virus like
Merciless

My way is fast
I hit and run
Won't leave no trace

I'm a sniper
The signs I set
Are painted
In deepest red

I serve the revolution
In a different way
My thoughts are radical
And I don't hesitate to slay
