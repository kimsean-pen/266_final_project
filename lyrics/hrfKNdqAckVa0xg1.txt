I met the candy queens
I met the court, they're so mean
Sound the Dionysus bell
Send them all back to hell

American nightmare
Guilty generation
Fingers on the pulse of their parents' alienation
From the history, histories of Western civilization
Ahhhhh

The gift of affluent life
Was wasted on the fickle wife
Who slept in Californian hills
And gave herself the sleeping pills
And waits for the dollar bills
The papers say we're going to hell
