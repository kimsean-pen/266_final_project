A crowded room
You waved me over
And you were smiling too
Was that a sign?

We're talking talk
About the weather
You said you like it hot
Was that a sign?

Don't wanna think it's in my imagination
Don't wanna play it safe I wanna be in danger

He put his hand
Oh, on the table
And it was close to mine
Was that a sign?

I'm wandering what it means
Each and every day I do
Sit here and dream
Cause dreaming is all that I can do

I'm wandering what it means
Each and every day I do
Sit here and dream
Cause dreaming is all that I can do

He put his hand
Oh, on the table
And it was close to mine
Was that a sign?

Was that a sign?
Was that a sign?
Was that a sign?
