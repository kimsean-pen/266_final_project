Warn your warmth to turn away,
Here it's December,
Everyday.

Press your lips to the sculptures,
And surely you'll stay (Love like winter)

For of sugar and ice,
I am made. I am made

(It's in the blood,
It's in the blood).
I met my love before I was born.
(He wanted love,
I taste of blood).
He bit my lip, and drank my war,
From years before, from years before.

She exhales vanilla lace,
I barely dreamt her, yesterday (yesterday)
Read the lines in the mirror through,
The lipstick trace.
(Por siempre)

She said "It seems you're somewhere, far away" to his face.

(It's in the blood,
It's in the blood).
I met my love before I was born.
(She wanted love,
I taste of blood).
She bit my lip, and drank my war,
From years before, from years before.

Love Like Winter, oh, oh.
Love Like Winter, Winter.
Three, four

(It's in the blood,
It's in the blood).
I met my love before I was born.
(He wanted love,
I taste of blood).
He bit my lip, and drank my war,
From years before, from years before.
