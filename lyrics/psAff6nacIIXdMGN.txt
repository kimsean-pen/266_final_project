All round me burdens
Seem to fall
I'm not worried at all
I'm not worried

All round me burdens
Seem to fall
I'm not worried at all
I'm not worried at all

I don't worry
All way long
I don't worry
All way long

All round me burdens
Seem to fall
I'm not worried at all
I'm not worried

All round me burdens
Seem to fall
I'm not worried at all
I'm not worried at all

I don't worry
All way long
I don't worry
All way long

All round me burdens
Seem to fall
I'm not worried at all
I'm not worried

All round me burdens
Seem to fall
I'm not worried at all
I'm not worried at all

Just I'm not evil
I just cannot see
He told me to pray
Just for me

Just I'm not evil
I just cannot see
He told me to pray
Just for me

All round me burdens
Seem to fall
I'm not worried at all
I'm not worried

All round me burdens
Seem to fall
I'm not worried at all
I'm not worried at all

I'm not worried at all, I'm not worried at all
I'm not worried at all, I'm not worried at all
I'm not worried at all, I'm not worried at all
I'm not worried at all, I'm not worried at all
