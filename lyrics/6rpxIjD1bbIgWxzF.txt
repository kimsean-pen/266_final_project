I'd like to know what it's all about, what's out there.
Am I gonna get old and laugh, about something.
Will I get me a boy or a girl, or not either.
Will I get what I want from this world, im a day dreamer.
Then I watched the old couple dance,
Step on my old size nines and I'll take you round.
I'd like to know what you're all about, what's up there.
Are you gonna get old and laugh, without a care.
Will you get you a boy or a girl, or not either.
Will you get what you want from this world, a day dreamer.
Then I watched the old couple dance,
Step on my old size nines and I'll take you round.
I'd like to know what we're all about, what we all have done.
Am I gonna get old and laugh, with someone.
Think I'll get me a boy and a girl, or not either.
Will I get what I want from this world, I'm a day dreamer.
Then I watched the old couple dance,
Step on my old size nines and I'll take you 'round...
