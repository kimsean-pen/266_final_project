You wake to greet the brand new day
Look up realize you're late
Rush out to make your plane
Can't find your keys again
The rent's been due for weeks
You need this gig to eat
Your car starts to leak
The engine's really weak
It won't start up in time
You try to find a ride
The bills weren't paid on time
Your cell phone lost the line
The problems wont go away
They keep piling on your plate
You just want to escape
You need to re-awake

Awake now listen to the words I'm
Saying in this line that your life will be just fine and
Troubles do not stay they
Get replaced with good times
Now you got a great life
Smile as you walk by
Thinking about the Day

Its late your legs wont rest today
Your body seems to ache
Your mind will win the race
Burning by your sleep again
The light blooms from the sun
The long dark night un-done
Another day of fun
Waiting for some luck to come
You keep hoping for a day
For things to go your way
When all decisions have been made
And karma's finally found its way
The drinks they pass the time
They help you to unwind
The guilt is killing me inside
Your eyes they need to reawake

Awake now listen to the words I'm
Saying in this line that your life will be just fine and
Troubles do not stay they
Get replaced with good times
Now you got a great life
Smile as you walk by
Thinking about the Day

Its grey the rain pours down my face
The tears become erased
A cleansing of my fate
Splashing down into my grin
My eyes become alive
A feeling left behind
A hidden world untied
Creating all you see today
The clouds they went away
Forever did I wait
But karma found my plate
Now Im smiling in the sun
We'll meet again someday
You smile and than ill say
When it rains it pours all day
Until love can find its way

now listen to the words I'm
Saying in this line that your life will be just fine and
Troubles do not stay they
Get replaced with good times
Now you got a great life
Smile as you walk by
Thinking about the Day
