i'm self-obsessed
wrong words i said
it's clear that some things aren't worth really trying

so let it go, let it be
then we'll talk and i can
dream you're not here
persevere, i could live without this

the one you'd like to go
is taken much too slow

you're not impressed
wrong words i said
a mere subject of your self-indulgence

so let it go, let it be
shall we to talk about it
my misery is when you breathe
there's no doubt about it
