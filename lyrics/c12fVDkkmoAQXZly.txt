One thing to overs 'bout to Jamaica
we are the confidence of the African continent in the RasTafari
No influence is greater, and the state of the nation is Testament to why
the people a suffer from a dis-ease of the mind
them have them enemy as them deity so dem worship the blind
but the real Black Madonna is the right full divine
and the King and Queen crown same time
balance!

From generation to generation
the tradition of righteousness is passed on from the ancients,
setting a precedence of excellence
ritual devotion onto the mastery of the instrument
strings, wind, percussion and vocal
Nyabinghi vibration, one two order
The Most High meditation with the high-grade marijuana
