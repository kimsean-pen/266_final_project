Stop it baby, you drive too fast
You know you can't make it, won't ever last
Don't care about them, as long as you're good
You're so talented, so misunderstood

And in your head, you've got it all
All you ever said, you'll never fall
Stay in bed or try to stand up tall
Don't look back in case it gets too dark
You've been lost in yourself

Every time you push too hard
You're dedicated to it, gonna be a star
You're so tired now, spinning around
Will you grow older? Will you fall down?

And in your head, you've got it all
All you ever said, you'll never fall
Stay in bed or try to stand up tall
Don't look back in case it gets too dark
You've been lost in yourself
