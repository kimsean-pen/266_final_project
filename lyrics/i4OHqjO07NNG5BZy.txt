So many people turn me one way
So many people turn me to stay
Never time to have my mind made up
Caught in a motion and I don't wanna stop

So many people turn me one way
So many people turn me to stay
Never time to have my mind made up
Caught in motion and I don't wanna stop

So many people turn me one way
So many people turn me to stay
Never time to have my mind made up
Caught in motion and I don't wanna stop

So many people turn me one way
So many people turn me to stay
Never time to have my mind made up
Caught in a motion and I don't wanna stop

And I don't want to stop
And I don't want to stop
