Never gave a fuck, CDG my Nikes (Sauce)
Big ass blunt, can you roll my Backwood please (Gat, gat, gat)

Ooh, you think that you stylish but nobody styling me (Skrt skrt)
You think that you stylish but nobody styling me (Hey)
We smoke exotic, okay tell nobody
Yeah I got a room while yo' ass in the lobby
You know where to find me, you still be in high, please
Used to be in Follies, now I need a ten piece
Louis V don't tempt me, smoke it 'til it's empty
Push that pedal like ten speed, Road Runner meet me
Really tryna clap them cheat sheets, first class going up
You know that she glowing up, tell that lil' bih hold up
You know my money don't fold, satellite, I'm going up
Cashew I'm going nut, bad bih on the bus
You see how my life lining up, uh (Ooh)
Now I got enough, uh (Ooh)
All my diamonds bust (Ooh)
I got bread like crust (Ooh)
