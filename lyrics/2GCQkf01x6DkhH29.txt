I'm burning but it feels like ice
Sometimes it feels like ice
In this frozen desert I live my life
When everyday is a fight
Burning, but it feels like ice
Sometimes it feels like ice
In this frozen desert, I live my life

I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning, I'm burning
But it feels like ice, in this frozen desert
I live my life, when everyday is a fight
I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning, I'm burning
But it feels like ice, in this frozen desert
I live my life, when everyday is a fight

Help me out, show me the way
Too much time carrying this weight
If this a game, I don't wanna play
You gotta show some love or let me get away
Help me out, show me the way
Too much time carrying this weight
If this a game, I don't wanna play
You gotta show some love or let me get away

I find myself in a desert of ice and flames
And I wonder, what is my blame?
Could you help me to leave this place? Oh
I find myself in a desert of ice and flames
And I wonder, what is my blame?
Could you help me to leave this place? Oh

I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning, I'm burning
But it feels like ice, in this frozen desert
I live my life, when everyday is a fight
I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning, I'm burning
But it feels like ice, in this frozen desert
I live my life, when everyday is a fight

When everyday is a fight

When ever-, when ever-, when everyday is a fight

When everyday is a fight

What did I do to feel this blues?
Every little thing for you is taboo
And I'm not like that, you're always mad
If this is nightmare, I wanna wake up
What did I do to feel this blues?
Every little thing for you is taboo
And I'm not like that, you're always mad
If this is nightmare, I wanna wake up

I find myself in a desert of ice and flames
And I wonder, what is my blame?
Could you help me to leave this place? Oh
I find myself in a desert of ice and flames
And I wonder, what is my blame?
Could you help me to leave this place? Oh

I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning, I'm burning
But it feels like ice, in this frozen desert
I live my life, when everyday is a fight
I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning, I'm burning
But it feels like ice, in this frozen desert
I live my life, when everyday is a fight

When everyday is a fight
When ever-, when ever-, when everyday is a fight

When everyday is a fight

When ever-, when ever-, when everyday is a fight

When everyday is a fight

Everyday is a fight
