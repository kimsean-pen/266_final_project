I've lost a part of me
Tell your friends to sharpen their teeth
There's a few quid to be made

And my soul's a sorry state
So come on down, you're empty lovers
Wolves come out of the woodwork
And the snakes start to sing

Do you feel the chair
Clawing at the back of your neck?
And start to spell
Did you really think that you could fix me?
We'll sell your bones for another roll
We'll sharpen your teeth
Tell yourself that it's just business

Wolves come out of the woodwork
Leeches come from out of the dirt
Rats come out of the holes they call home
And I fall apart
And the snakes start to sing

Don't say I'm better off dead
Cause heaven's full and hell won't have me
Won't you make some room in your bed
Well you could lock me up in your heart
And throw away the key
Won't you take me out of my head?

I'm just a would've been, could've been
Should've been, never was and never ever will be
We'll sharpen your teeth
Tell yourself that it's just business
Would've been, could've been
Should've been, never was, and never ever will be
Wolves come out of the woodwork
And the snakes start to sing

Wolves come out of the woodwork
Leeches come from out of the dirt
Rats come out of the holes they call home
And I fall apart
And the snakes start to sing

If you can't soar with the eagles
Then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting high?
Did you catch your own reflection
In the knife my mother held?
Or the hell in my father's eyes?

If you can't soar with the eagles
Then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting by?
Was I your knight in shining armor?
The apple of your eye?
Or just a step to climb?

If you can't soar with the eagles
Then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting high?
Did you catch your own reflection
In the knife my mother held?
Or the hell in my father's eyes?

If you can't soar with the eagles
Then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting by?
Was I your knight in shining armor?
Or the apple of your eye?
Or just a step, a fucking step to climb
