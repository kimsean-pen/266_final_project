I've run to ground
I've run from everyone that I have ever known
I'm aching cold
I'm aching from the bones the very blood of me

And it's broke before you know it
Before you knew what it was for
All you know is you can't fix it
And you wish you'd listened more
To your instincts to your family
To the wisdom you'd ignored
Are you finally gonna ask us for help?

I've crashed to earth
But I'd fallen for so long that it was just relief
I saw your face
In everyone that looked me in my drunken eyes

And it's broke before you know it
Before you knew what it was for
All you know is you can't fix it
And you wish you'd listened more
To your instincts to your family
To the wisdom you'd ignored
When you finally gonna ask us for help?

I can see you at the front gate
As you wait on my return
The years have blurred to eons
But the tears have never dried
But I'm not coming to you like this
So battered down and sad
I will take the road forgotten again
