You're earth bound, I'm injured,
We move too fast to remember the drive on to me.
Drive on to me, we carved the days from the hours,
You showed me all i could have in the drive on to me.
You were free when i was taken.
You did your best to change that in the drive on to me.
You stop and i'm in overdrive you look the stars with your eyes,
And then drive on to me.
Accident when we needed, i'm stronger as we near it.
We can't help to watch this whole thing crash together.
We are the bruised and the tender.
We are the crack that was mended.
From all the times we ever tried,
we should've found each other in this drive on to me.
