You're only twenty nine
gotta lot to learn,
but when your mummy dies
she will not return
We like noise it's our choice

if's what we wanna do,
we don't care about long hair

i don't wear flares
See my face not a trace
no reality,
i don't work i just speed

that's all i need
I'm a lazy sod...

that's what we say you're
i'm a lazy sod...
i'm so lazy
i can't even be bothered
lazy lazy
