Take my efforts high above red hues
Bones of ribbon don't stop me now
Whites went blue, then went yellow
Feet don't stop me now
They found me there in the sands
Bones of ribbon in my hands
Whites went blue, then went yellow
Pull off the cloak, time off the wall

Take determination
Take whatever you need
'Cause your body's made of metal
And your skin, it isn't real

Found me there in the sands
Bones of ribbon in my hands
Whites went blue, then went yellow
Please don't stop me now

Take determination
Take whatever you need
'Cause your body's made of metal
And your skin, it isn't real

They found me there in the sands
Bones of ribbon in my hand
Whites went blue, and then went yellow
And your feet don't stop me now
Feet don't stop me now

Well you know when you know, hey
Oh no, do you know it enough, hey
You won't know 'till you know it enough
You won't know 'till you know you know it enough
Feet don't stop me now
Feet don't stop me now
