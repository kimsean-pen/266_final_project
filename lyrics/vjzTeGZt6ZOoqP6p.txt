Savannah, I hope to be there by the morning
And see this pining all transforming
Into the arms of the Georgia sun

Savannah, I'd love to feel the heat the sunrise
Brushing rays across my windshield as if one dries
The streams from off my face

Yet I know you'll be there 'cause you'll know
I'll want you to be there and we'll say hello
As you're smiling in love and we'll sigh so relieved
I believe because we will both know by tonight
We'll feel normal again but until then

Savannah, our backs supported by a hammock
We sum up perfection like a handbook
And God knows it all too well

Savannah, we'll take a walk to find a gift shop
Who would've thought the book that you bought
Would never come off the shelf

Yet I know you'll be there 'cause you'll know
I'll want you to be there and we'll say hello
As you're smiling in love and we'll sigh so relieved
I believe because we will both know by tonight
We'll feel normal again but until then, until then, until then

Baby, I spent my life wondering, wondering when I'd find you
I searched for all these years and now you're right here
And I need you to know that
Everything makes sense when you're with me

Savannah, walk out into the sultry evening
Cotton breathing when the sea winds
Brush the hair down around your neck

Savannah, you hold my hand like it's the first time
And all the feelings that our hearts find
Will be just what we expect

Yet I know you'll be there 'cause you'll know
I'll want you to be there and we'll say hello
As you're smiling in love and we'll sigh so relieved
I believe because we will both know by tonight
We'll feel normal again but until then, until then, until then
