Pink press threat!

Man with chip: I'm riding third class on a one-class train.
I'm cranked at nought like a wimpey crane.

I'm a pink prole threat.

Gent in safe-house: get out the pink press threat file

Man with chip: it's de-louse, safe-house time
(now v. bitter) when I get to the safe house
Hanging rhyme
Hang this crummy blitz trad. by it's neck
Pink press threat
I escaped the pink prole effect

Gent in safe-house: it's a new prole art threat

Dissipated and knacked, of sheer brilliance
At home, video reach, --up till now
Stereo bog etc.
