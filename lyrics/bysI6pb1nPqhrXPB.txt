Listen I, I don't believe in maybe, prolly
Only off, and on, overthinking had me idle
Kiss my dice, and throw, this Remy got my gut on fire
I gotta drive home still, one eye open
Seeing Dos on the road, oh no
Life insurance is really doin' exactly what you like
And love 'cause that's that shit that keep the fire lightin' up
Get out the dark and spark, yeah
Gon' head, lighten up
No gravity on me, one with the sky

Maraca, maraca, we make somethin' shake
Sinatra, Sinatra, we all want Frank
Bend my heart, bend my eye, but I won't break
Gratata pop out like hot bread
Don't burn tongue ma, trine bite down so quick
Wait ya turn
Might let you participate

I feel like Percy, No Limit, uh
We don't believe in their parameters
All my niggas on perimeter
I'm on they ass like an enema
And all my enemies been friending up
Like Monica and Chandler
You see this bass can break a chandelier
And this verse just cracked a bannister
Man I pray the crowd can stand in here
Bruh it's so many hands in here
Niggas'll think we selling manicures
I never view myself as amateur
And when it's just me, myself and marmalady
I give her the seeds so sweet, shawty that pomegranate
Couldn't imagine myself takin' this shit for granted
Life ain't even granted
Off the strength, I'm brown-skinned
Shit ain't sweet, no candy grace my tongue
Just bitter back taste
Runnin' for the cheese, definition of the rat race
Put the pedal to the floor mat
We only kick it w-where the dough's at

Maraca, maraca, we make somethin' shake
Sinatra, Sinatra, we all want Frank
Bend my heart, bend my eye, but I won't break
Gratata pop out like hot bread
Don't burn tongue ma, trine bite down so quick
Wait ya turn
Might let you participate

I usually, usually, usually don't do this
So don't you confuse this
With school, bitch game ain't free
I'm booking my flight, got a suitcase
Gotta move, bae
Bada-bing-bada-boomaye
Skrrt, peew on Suzuki
That's two wheels, if you will then I will
If you scared then I feel, I feel you
But if you real then I extract my grill
And I snack on that 'til that blood sugar build
We ain't even meet and shawty want the gyro, woah
Got the whole, zero, on a clear road, woah
Nigga found his pen over off of Penrose
My auntie stayed in the ville, no not talking J. Cole
Blkswn time bomb, dropping 3-1-4
Last time I was in my city, all my people, they told me, nigga
SHUT IT DOWN
Yeah yeah, they told me, nigga
SHUT IT DOWN
They told me, nigga

Listen I, I don't believe in maybe, prolly
Only off, and on, overthinking had me idle
Kiss my dice, and throw, this Remy got my gut on fire
I gotta drive home still, one eye open
Seeing Dos on the road, oh no
Life insurance is really doin' exactly what you like
And love 'cause that's the shit that keep the fire lightin' upp
Get out the dark and spark, yeah
Gon' head, lighten up
No gravity on me, one with the sky
