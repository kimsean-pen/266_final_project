I am hungry
I have been hungry
I was born hungry
What do I need?

I am something
I have been something
I was born something
What could I be?

There is a light that I can see
But only, it seems, when there's darkness in me
There is a dream that I sometimes see
That only appears in the dark of sleep

I am waiting
I have been waiting
I was born waiting
I was born waiting for that something
Just one something

I was born something
I was born

There is a light, I feel it in me
But only, it seems, when the dark surrounds me
There is a dream and it sleeps in me

Keeps me awake in the night

Crying sets me free

And I wake every night

Crying sets me free
