Sea salt going up and down
You jump off and not come crashing down
How hard could it really be
For you to find something nice to say to me?
Baby it'll just take time
For you to look me straight in the eye
I don't know why you treat me this way
Like I'm a criminal (criminal)

I say
Oh, isn't that strange
Oh, as it starts to change
Oh, lovers and friends
Go back to being strangers again

You were someone that I knew
From being at the same place our friends go to
I like how you didn't really care
If anyone saw us making out over there
Eventually, you lost that fight
Did she look at you with these eyes?
I don't know why you treat me this way
Like I'm a criminal (criminal)
You say
Oh, isn't that strange?
Oh, you know it's bound to change
Oh, lovers and friends
Go back to being strangers again

Say hello, say goodbye
A hundred times in your life
It's for the best, but it's still so sad
A little more understanding wouldn't be so bad

Oh, you know it's bound to change
Oh, lovers and friends
Go back, go back
Oh, isn't that strange?
Oh, you know it's bound to change
Oh, lovers and friends
Go back to being strangers
Being strangers again
