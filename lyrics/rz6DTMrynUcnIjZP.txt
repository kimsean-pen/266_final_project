Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end

Oh, can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

Oh, staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Ah oh, can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time, to climb too high
All the time, to climb too high
All the time, to keep you off my mind
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

High
All the time, to climb too high
All the time, to climb too high
All the time, to keep you off my mind
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end

Oh, can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

Oh, staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Ah oh, can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time, to climb too high
All the time, to climb too high
All the time, to keep you off my mind
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

High
All the time, to climb too high
All the time, to climb too high
All the time, to keep you off my mind
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
