Look to the sky the time has come
Stand and be brave you body feels numb
Face the atrocity at what you have become
Twisting your mind it's only just begun

Fear of religion, war, insanity
This decision - die for my deity
Power to those who question destiny
Man destroys untamed animosity

Blood - the taste of death is sweet
Death - my victory is complete
Devour - your soul now we're as one
Mercy - in this world I give you none

I am the carrion lord
Bow to me and give me praise
Sacrifice the blood of a thousand souls
Only then your life I will save

You're my living warrior
My strength shall be my revenge
You shall have no remorse
As you slay for my right
To control the downfall of man

Fear of religion, war, insanity
This decision - die for my deity
Power to those who question destiny
Man destroys untamed animosity

Blood - the taste of death is sweet
Death - my victory is complete
Devour - your soul now we're as one
Mercy - in this world I give you none

For only the insane have the strength to prosper
And only those that prosper truly judge what is sane
