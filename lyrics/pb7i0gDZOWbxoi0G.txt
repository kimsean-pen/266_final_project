The sons and brothers
fighting for another cause
anything to give their lives some meaning
busy with their guns and dreaming
far away from here
said they would act in self-defence

And all the others
running 'round so hot and bothered
anything to give their lives some meaning
in the evening
running around with guns and
said they would act in self-defence
with violence

Violence
Violence
Violence breeds violence
Violence breeds

The son and brother
when he gets home
he gives someone some love
and mutters
'Woman, you'll never understand
I did what I said in self-defence
with violence'

Violence breeds violence
Violence breeds violence
Violence breeds violence
