The world is a marble heart
Too fragile, too broken
Left without nothing but our backs to hold on to
You're out in the daylight
And out of the jungle
We could have been, we should have been
What your heart couldn't handle

Feel like I need, to forget you
Runaway girl, cause I let you
Now you found some other man, you see...
I'm better off without you, cause the man ain't me!

I'm going back now
To the beginning
What you denied from the start...
And now you can't go breaking my heart (woah oh oh)
And now you can't go breaking my heart.

The world is a marble heart
It's bullshit and we know it
Like a flower sheltered in stone
With no chance of regrowing
Like push comes to shore
Like I'm out on your doorstep
We could have been, we should have been
With only my soul left

Feel like I need (woah oh), to forget you
Runaway girl, cause I let you
Now you found some other man, you see...
I'm better off without you, cause the man ain't me!

I'm going back now
To the beginning
What you denied from the start...
And now you can't go breaking my heart (yeah ah ah, woah oh oh)
And now you can't go breaking my heart.

Feel like I need, to forget you

And now you can't go breaking my heart (yeah ah ah, woah oh oh)
And now you can't go breaking my heart.
