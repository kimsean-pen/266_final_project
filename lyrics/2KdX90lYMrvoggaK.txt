I've been digging a grave with the parts of my brain that still work.
They're burying me with my dead dreams, my dead dreams.

I've been digging a grave with the parts of my brain that still work.
They're burying me with my dead dreams, my dead dreams.
I still feel a heart that's beating but I can't feel love
I still feel a life inside me but I feel no blood
I still clench my teeth and I pull out my hair;
my skin and bones are bare.
I've been living with the weight of the world and the moon and the stars, burning in my eyes.
I haven't seen clear in 19 years;
Will you please save my life?
