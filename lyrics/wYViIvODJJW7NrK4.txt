I wanna throw the fight and kiss away your pain tonight
But that would only make this harder
She can't stand to sleep alone, ah no, and I hate losing so
I wait till we get tired

Well, the cold outside knows we can't be alone
So I throw my arms right beside hers
Then I close my eyes lean in for something more
And you, you light my fire

As your heartbeat keeps me warm
We take Fourth Street cross corners to the bar
Where I slurred, convinced we could make it brighter

I know we're not as young as we'd like to be
But I like to think you're bound to get the best of me
C'mon babe, your love gets me high

I know one day I'll fall for an oath
I just spend all my life trying to find her
But I burned down every door I'd ever shut
When you, you light my fire, you light my fire

I wanna throw the fight and kiss away your pain tonight
But that would only make this harder

Well, I know one day I'll fall for an oath
I just spend all of my life on the run looking over my shoulder
Now I burn down every door I ever shut

When you, I said you
When you, you light my fire
