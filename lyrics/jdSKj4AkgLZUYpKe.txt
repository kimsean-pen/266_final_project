Looking at all the rows
All these records look like big zeroes
Got your picture on the back of a 45
A placeholder until you take up mine
A placeholder until you take up mine

I'm the person you'll never need
The biggest loser on 16th Street
The invisible man with the see-through mind
A placeholder until you take up mine
A placeholder until you take up mine

Break off of in someone's laughter
You can tell right there
He's still a square
He likes the way that you look now
Like an open book

Just like my favorite song
Some pretty words that didn't last that long
Like a package sent priority overnight
Placeholder, come and take up mine
Placeholder, come and take up mine
Placeholder, come and take up mine
Placeholder, come and take up mine
