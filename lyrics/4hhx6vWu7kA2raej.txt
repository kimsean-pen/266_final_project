From the day that we were born we've been heading down a track
Sometimes it's made for good sometimes for bad
But if we look behind us there's a wave coming down
Carrying us forward to a new age

(What about the world?)
What about the world around us?
(What about the world?)
(What about the world?)
How can we fail to see?
(What about the world?)
(Aah, aah)
And now that our fathers have gone
(Gone)
And we've been left to carry on
What about the age of reason?

So why can't we be still?
Why can't we love each other?
Is kindness an ancient skill buried by our blindness?
And if we look behind us there's a wind blowing in
To create the age of reason

(What about the world?)
What about the world around us?
(What about the world?)
(What about the world?)
How can we fail to see?
(What about the world?)
(Aah, aah)
And now that our fathers have gone
(Gone)
And we've been left to carry on
What about the age of reason?

If we consider carefully
The options put before us
So much wisdom so much love
So much waiting for us
And if we look ahead
There's the sun and the seasons
Another day, another age of reason

(What about the world?)
What about the world around us?
(What about the world?)
(What about the world?)
How can we fail to see?
(What about the world?)
(Aah, aah)
And now that our fathers have gone
(Gone)
And we've been left to carry on
What about the age of reason?

(What about the world?)
What about the world around us?
(What about the world?)
(What about the world?)
How can we fail to see?
(What about the world?)
(Aah, aah)
And now that our fathers have gone
(Gone)
And we've been left to carry on
What about the age...?
(What about the world around us?)
(What about the world?)
(What about the world?)
How can we fail to see?
(What about the world?)
(Aah, aah)
And now that our fathers have gone
(Gone)
And we've been left to carry on
What about the age of reason?
