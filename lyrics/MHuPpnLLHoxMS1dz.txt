Shouldn't it always be so simple
Like how it's always been so simple
All of our photographs blur
We're running too fast

Shouldn't it always be this simple
We've got the ocean, time's just a ripple
Under the screen we laugh, we blur
We're swimming too fast

But ooh, i am an optimist
I am an optimist
But I'm not prepared for this here-
What if I have to go
What if that's how we know
The best things don't last forever here

Why can't it always be this simple
I cry so you hold me for a little
We hide in your room with the curtains closed
To the end of the world

But ooh, i am an optimist
I am an optimist
But I'm not prepared for this here-
What if I have to go
What if that's how we know
The best things don't last forever here
