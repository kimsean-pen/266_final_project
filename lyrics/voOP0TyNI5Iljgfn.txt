One two three four
Feelin' sorry, feelin' sad
So many ugly people, I feel bad
I'm so cute, they're so homely
Some of them at home 'n' lonely
Wish they could be very cute like me
They will never get to be
Some folks got it, some folks don't
Some so ugly they never won't
Everybody see his hair
See his clothes I'm sure you care
Terry Ted is really sweet
Watch the way he keep the beat
Sweet as honey, he's a piece of cake
From the ginseng root 'n' stuff he take
Vitamin E 'n' all the B's
He's so cool he'll make you freeze
Make you freeze, make you freeze
Excuse me please
Step aside, I'm gonna ride
I'm gonna strut, I'm gonna slide
Hey, ugly folks, go get some cyanide
An' die die die die die
Ugly is bad
And bad is wrong
And wrong is sinful
And sin leads to eternal damnation
An' hot burnin' fire, hot burnin' fire
Hot burnin' fire, hot burnin' fire
Screams of agony, screams of agony
Screams of agony, screams of agony
One two three four
I'm so cute
I'm so cute
I'm so cute
