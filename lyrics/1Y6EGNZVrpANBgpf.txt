I dream of you
Moment I can feel you there
I can hold you
But sometimes there's a shift in the motion
I can't keep you near, just stand in motion

Can I count on you?
Can I count on you?
You're my only virtue

Inner demons
That I can't seem to push aside
I can't stop it
And that's why I need you here
I am no good but you steer me clear of my bad oceans

Can I count on you
To be there with me now?
I can't bear the thought
Of losing you somehow
Please hold down the phone
Since I am not around
Can I count on you
To be there with me?
You're my only virtue

Now I may not deserve you
But I can not do without you
Didn't know what I had lost
You are my elevation
You're the closest thing to heaven
If you hadn't caught me
Then where am I meant to fall?
Moments I can feel you
Hold you in my arms
Feels as forgetting from

Can I count on you
To be there with me now?
I can't bear the thought
Of losing you somehow
Please hold down the phone
Since I am not around
Can I count on you
To be there with me?
You're my only virtue

Can I count on you?
Can I, can I, can I count on you?
You're my only virtue
Count on you, count on you
