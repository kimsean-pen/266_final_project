For those who tread lightly, who need some enlightenment
The world is what you make of it
You fill it up and break it 'til
The pieces inside you [x2]
Help you find your way back home
So take it or leave it

'Cause I don't believe it

And you wont receive it until you achieve it
I know that you need it
to show you're a leader
And let love flow
'til it echos slow
And makes its way across the globe

Well that's the way ya do it
Nearly getting by
Well what could be more stupid?

'Cause before you know it your life is over
So fly or die
At least you know your livin'
If you get too high
Well what could be more thrillin'
'cause before you know it your life is over
So fly, fly, fly or die, die, die, die, die, die, die

Today your beginning the life you'll be living
And every thought and every step will take you closer to the dreams you kept deep inside you
Inside it will guide you
So keep your ear close to your heart
Well it's easy to see it but harder to say it
The heart of the art
Is to try and relay it
Until you can play it
Or show and display it
To those who are waiting to stop the complaining
But let love flow
As the sun sets low
'Cause that's the only way to go

Well that's the way ya do it
Nearly getting by
Well what could be more stupid?
'Cause before you know it your life is over
So fly or die
At least you know your livin'
If you get too high
Well what could be more thrillin'
'cause before you know it your life is over
So fly, fly, fly or die, die, die, die, die, die, die

Well that's the way ya do it
Nearly getting by
Well could be more stupid?
'Cause before you know it your life is over
So fly or die
At least you know your livin'
If you get too high
Well what could be more thrillin'
'cause before you know it your life is over
So fly, fly, fly or die, die, die, die, die, die, die
DIE
