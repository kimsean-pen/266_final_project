Same old lies, sequester the nonbelievers
Don't forgive the ones
Who trespass against us
Smiling deceivers, painted faces
By the wishing well
You don't even trust yourself

Why do we face the same thing
If change is a constant?
Have we not learned
From the past, from the past?

The stillborn star we'll never know
The parent's love that won't let go
The bullied teen that's ready to shoot
A tear and a 21 gun salute
Welcome to the age of misinformation
Seeking control, your reflection's a stranger

Why do we face the same thing
If change is a constant?
Have we not learned from the past?

As we all fall down, the jester still sings to me
As we all fall down
The silver lining screams to me
Descending madness violently

The poisoning of tribes, to the lifeline of Flint
Now the black snake
It crawls deep within sacred grounds
We will never consent

The night watch man just buying his time
An outcast, a resident
A transient, the punishment
One dollar bill, no table for two
So many questions no one ever asked

As we all fall down, the jester still sings to me
As we all fall down
The silver lining screams to me
Descending madness violently
As we all fall down
As we all fall down
The silver lining screams to me
Descending madness violently
