I lick the salt and toss my hair
Don't I remind you of somebody somewhere subtle
Don't waste your time, if you wanna catch me
You're no friend of mine

You ain't no Romeo
Not my first rodeo and now
We're the kids who got kids at parties
I was impossible when I was beautiful and now
Cartoon deaths just don't seem so funny
I got a death wish by my side
So don't you wanna take me for a ride?
We can leave together, sleep in the car
Silver firecracker knows where we are

We're younger than we think
Crying the kitchen sink and when
Did I bury my dreams of running?
I was impossible when I was beautiful and now
I'm the kismet kill nailed beside you

You ain't no Romeo
Not my first rodeo and now
We're the kids who got kids at parties
I was impossible when I was beautiful and now
I'm the kismet kill nailed beside you
Nailed beside you
