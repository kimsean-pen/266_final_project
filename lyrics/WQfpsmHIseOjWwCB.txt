can you hear me father john?
have you lost what you believe?
what's the matter what's the meaning
when nothing's as it seems?
sit down at the table now
there's reason there's reprieve
(though you never would know it)
even those who are yet to
come are sharers in your grief

because in a little while when all will be over
you're going to say goodbye go and get your closure
in a hundred years when you're just a haze on the water
and then when it clears it's another's turn to discover
but you know they'll have to let go like you

can you hear me caleb?
on the morning when you came
it was me who wrote onto
the wooden door your name
it'll last there longer than
in this body i can stay
(because we all will be moving)
if you ever return again
write another's on the frame

because in a little while when all will be over
you're going to say goodbye go and get your closure
in a hundred years when you're just a haze on the water
and then when it clears it's another's turn to discover
but you know they'll have to let go like you
