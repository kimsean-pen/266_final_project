your cold smile's retired
there's one much brighter
i just can't compete
you laugh to loud when you say
throw caution away
it changes everything
my friend it could be anything
a different name changes everything
but what matters
what really does'nt matter
we're caught in this hit and run
it all becomes so vague
it's one step brighter
hanging out of the windows
in the corridors
should your reflection fail
there's visions for sale
pretend they're anything
my friend they could be anything
a different name changes everything.
