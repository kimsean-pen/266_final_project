No I can not wife a thot, bitch no I won't, I just cannot
She say, "Can I slide through?" Bitch no you can't, you just cannot
I treat you same way I do a opp, both you gettin' dropped
I take the drop to the car wash and then I drop the top
Look at these niggas lookin', they too mad, I gained alot
I be laughin' so hard, my stomach hurt, I just cannot
She say "Can I get a date?" Hoe no you can't, we just cannot
I heard you at them niggas' 'Bnb, droppin' team top

I'ma born Memphis nigga with a degree in playin' dirty
Told that bitch I ain't got no time I'm always in a hurry
I pull up, shut down a town, you whack, won't even worry
Hollow Squad pull through and watch them niggas scurry in a hurry
I try to find out a nigga issue
Hit him once that's enough, hit 'em twice that's a dub
Do I look like a nigga that'll miss you?
Stop playin', that's enough, you can leave a nigga where he was
Rub-A-Dub in the tub with ya new boo
Let her tell it, you a scrub, I already knew what it was
Fuck him, her, them and you too
Run through, fuck it up then I smoke another blunt, uh
Let me catch my breath
I make sure I make my threats truly heart felt
I'm an underground king and I ain't gonna drop the belt
You sissy rappers finna sink and we ain't sendin' help
Help, help bitch don't hurt yourself
I'm the shit that's in the back, you just the bottom shelf
I get too fly, I took his girl, all I could say was, "Welp"
I get it done and keep it movin', fuck who ever else (you bitch)

No I can not wife a thot, bitch no I won't, I just cannot
She say, "Can I slide through?" Bitch no you can't, you just cannot
I treat you same way I do a opp, both you gettin' dropped
I take the drop to the car wash and then I drop the top
Look at these niggas lookin', they too mad, I gained alot
I be laughin' so hard, my stomach hurt, I just cannot
She say "Can I get a date?" Hoe no you can't, we just cannot
I heard you at them niggas' 'Bnb, droppin' team top
