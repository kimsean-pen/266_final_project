I'm walking.
I'm walking.

I don't know for how long,
maybe I was really wrong.

I'm walking.

I'm sad, so terribly sad.
I'm grieving about the things I had.
I'm sad, so terribly sad.
I simply can't see the road ahead.

I'm walking.

don't care where it will end,
my pain a powerful torrent.

I'm walking.

my feet carry me,
but still I'm anything but free.

I'm walking.
I'm walking.
I'm walking.

I'm sad, so terribly sad.
I'm grieving about the things I had.
I'm sad, so terribly sad.
I simply can't see the road ahead.
I'm sad, so terribly sad.
but I can't say that I'm still afraid.

I'm sad, so terribly sad.
I'm grieving about the things I had.
I'm sad, so terribly sad.
I simply can't see the road ahead.

I'm sad, so terribly sad.
I'm grieving about the things I had.
I'm sad, so terribly sad.
but I can't say that I'm still afraid.
