Honey white, honey white
Honey white

Made a deal for some angel food
Honey white, honey white
Everybody told her it was sweet and good yea
Oh honey, oh honey
Oh honey, oh honey

She said you'll see me later yea you'll see me later
Will you see me later seemed all too soon
And then he smiles he knows honey's coming back
Honey's going to want some more angel food

Devil made of honey, devil made of honey
Devil made of honey, devil made of honey

She said you'll get me when I'm old and wizened
And not a day before that
The devil said honey it won't be that long
Besides I like to see a little more fat
Yea I like to see a little more fat
You know I like to see a little more fat

Honey white, honey white
Honey white, honey white
Uh tell me how is your angel food
Honey white oh honey white
She says it's sweet and good
Honey white honey white uh honey white

The sweetness starts to fade
Honey white, honey white
Thought you could get away
Poor honey, poor honey
Poor honey, poor honey
