I insist
That you are in love my lover
You passed out
And I didn't even noticed
I think in position when I see your eyes
Freud will be very, very, very mad

So, so, so, so... sorry you're gone
So, so, so, so... deep in my mind

Lovely, lovely time is nothing but (lovely)
Lovely, lovely time is nothing while (lovely)
Lovely, lovely time is nothing but (lovely)

(Just me and myself)

You're a host of a ghost
You're a host of a ghost

You're a host, you're a host of a ghost
You're a host of a ghost, of a ghost, of a ghost
Lovely, lovely time is nothing but (lovely)
Lovely, lovely time is nothing but (lovely)...
(Lovely time.)
You're a host of a ghost...
