Tell Me One Thing You Write About
Take All Our Fears & Drink Them Out (All The Way Out)
It's Not The Same If We Condone Each Other swapping out the cheese for something similar
The Bait & Switch of Love & Logic Take My Life Please I Forgot it Ring the Bell & you'll get hard

I'd Come Around When I Hear That Sound
I'll Come Around

I'm Not Caught Up Like All The Other Guys But I'm Still Caught Up On Something
I'm Not Caught Up Like All The Other Guys But I'm Still Caught Up On Something
You, You

Tell Me One Thing You Care About
Take Your Beliefs & Shake Them Out (All The Way Out)
The Gates Are Open There's No Hoping Shutting Out The World & Fighting Over Small Differences
The World & All It's Discontent
Can't See The Beauty In The Present
Pass The Lucy On The Left

I'll Come Around When I Hear That Sound
I'll Come Around

She's A Stopper
Keep It Double
A Double Love Around & Make Me Humble
I Remember, I Remember
I Tied A String Around My Finger To Forget Her
(Echo, Echo) Do You Hear The Sound?
Something To Remember All My Inner [?]
(Mirror, Mirror) Please Don't Break
I Could've Take A Bullet To Never See Her Face Again, Again, Again
I'm Not Caught Up Like All The Other Guys But I'm Still Caught Up On Something
I'm Not Caught Up Like All The Other Guys But I'm Still Caught Up On Something

You, You
(I'm Caught Up On)
You
(I'm Caught Up On)
(I'm caught Up On)
