Like I said
"Leave your baggage at the back door"
I'm leaving you the way I think it should be
We're always pulling into spaces that we can't back out of
Starting fights, we can't talk our way out of them
Talk our way out of them, talk our way out of them

How does it feel to be on
The receiving end of this one
Of this one?

I'm half way there, it's all on me
This is what I get for wanting more, for wanting more
This is the way it's got to be
Desolate, alone, and searching
So I walk around with this rope in my hand, rope in my hand
So I'll tie it around and around and around
I'll tie me down

I'll fantasize of being manic
And leaving us behind
In your eyes you were the one that tried

Acceptance is what holds us here
And you my dear are the one I fear tonight
We'll try just one more time

This is the moment that we all live for
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

I'm half way there, it's all on me
This is what I get for wanting more, for wanting more
This is the way it's got to be
Desolate, alone, and searching
So I walk around with this rope in my hand, rope in my hand
So I'll tie it around and around and around
I'll tie me down

You can't see past my waving hands
Just running away again
You can't see past my waving hands
Just run!

You think so loud it hurts my ears

I want to know how to get through this
How to get through this
Without choking up

I want to know how to get through this
How to get through this
Without choking up

I can't feel you
You're so far from me

This is what I get for wanting more
I'm half way there
This is what I get for wanting more
I'm half way there, it's all on me

This is what I get for wanting more
I'm half way there
This is what I get for wanting more
I'm half way there, it's all on me

This is what I get for wanting more
I'm half way there
This is what I get for wanting more
I'm half way there, it's all on me
