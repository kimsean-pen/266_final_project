This is your chance
Revolt, resist!
Open my chest
Look down, reach in

Shedding your skin
Showing your texture
Time to let everything inside show

You're cutting all ties
Now and forever
Time to let everything outside you

This is your test
Come forth, Confess!
Extend your tongue
Speak Out, go on.

Shedding your skin
Showing your texture
Time to let everything inside show

You're cutting all ties
Now and forever
Time to let everything outside you

Shed your casing
Show your lines and shapes
Wear your insides
On the outside
Show your enemy
What you look like

From the inside

Cutting all ties
Now and forever
Time to let!

Shedding your skin
Showing your texture
Time to let everything inside show

You're cutting all ties
Now and forever
Time to let everything outside you

Shed your casing
Show your lines and shapes
Wear your insides
On the outside
Show your enemy
What you look like
