Don't wanna wait 'til the mornin'
Don't wanna wait 'til the mornin' comes
Ya know the bigger picture changes when your colors run

I got my hand in my pocket
& there's a diamond at my finger tips
Don't wanna wait 'til mornin'

You & I, we live for this
I rip holes in my shirt
There's mud on my shoes
There's sun on my skin
I am brand new
We shout at the cops

We howl at the moon
Just a matter of time
Don't you get it?
We are the kids that you never can kill

You never can kill, you never can kill
We say that we won't, but you know that we will
You know that we will keep on
Don't wanna wait for permission

We got our own fresh set of rules
We take that old school fashion
Shape it into something new
You got your hand in my pocket
You like to dance with my finger tips

Don't gotta wait for permission
You & I, we live for this
You know we live for this
We are the kids that you never can kill

You never can kill, you never can kill
We say that we won't, but you know that we will
You know that we will keep on
I said, we are the kids that you never can kill

You never can kill, you never can kill
We say that we won't, but you know that we will
You know that we will keep on
Lost boys, lost girls, hot tires, wild animals
We won't live forever
Hand over the future
Hand over the future
Hand over the future

Hand over the future
Now, now, now, now
I rip holes in my shirt
There's mud on my shoes
There's sun on my skin
I am brand new
We shout at the cops
We howl at the moon
Just a matter of time
Don't you get it?
We are the kids that you never can kill
You never can kill, you never can kill
We say that we won't, but you know that we will
You know that we will keep on
I said, we are the kids that you never can kill
You never can kill, you never can kill
We say that we won't, but you know that we will
You know that we will keep on
Come on, hand over the future
Hand over the future
Hand over the future
Hand over the future
Lost boys, lost girls
Come hand over the future
Hand over the future
Now, now, now, now
