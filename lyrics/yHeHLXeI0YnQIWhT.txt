Single brother
Got ripped off
Know why you don't get any gold
I painted on eyelids
Meanwhile, Becky...

Oh no here it comes the American guilt
Oh no here it comes the American guilt
Oh no here it comes the American guilt

When the meathead stands still
Even the Nazis like him
People picky

No!
No!
Oh... no!
Oh... no!
Oh... no!
Oh... no!
Oh... no!
Oh... no!
Oh...

Oh no here it comes the American guilt
Oh no here it comes the American guilt
Oh no here it comes the American guilt
Oh no here it comes the American guilt
