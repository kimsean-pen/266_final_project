Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
I'm not afraid to crawl through thick and thin
If only you noticed
If only you could see

In the struggle, there is solace
I'm not afraid to bleed

Just let the past go, it's ancient history
If you keep shutting me out, it's gonna haunt you
When you choke on your words
Don't you go and make a scene
I am the one you need
I am the blood that boils when you feel me through your veins
Don't you go and make a scene
Nothing is what it seems

Are we gonna let this go to waste and let it all decay

Don't you go and make a scene

Whoa
Whoa

Whoa
Whoa
With you or with out you misfortune finds it's way
Are you with me or against me I refuse to wait
I would have giving everything and now I want nothing to do with you
Now your choking on your words
Don't you go and make a scene

I am the one the one you need
I am the blood that boils when you feel me through your veins
Don't you go and make a scene

Nothing is what it seems
Are we gonna let this go to waste and let it all decay

Don't you go and make a scene
Go ahead blame me you can't defame me
Get it all out of your system
Go ahead and hate me I don't care
If you keep shutting me out it's gonna haunt you
When you choke on your words
Don't you go and make a scene
I am the one you need
I am the blood that boils when you feel me through your veins
Don't you go and make a scene
Nothing is what it seems
Are we gonna let this go to waste and let it all decay
Don't you go and make a scene
Whoa
Whoa
