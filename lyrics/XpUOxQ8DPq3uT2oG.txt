the moment she started talking, i heard nothing
(i like the way you walk, ramona show me how to stop)
she whispered out my name, and my heart did nothing
(i like the way you walk, ramona show me how to stop)
dialing up your phone again,
hoping it's not too late
ramona show your thighs
show you're mine for the lucky eyes
as bright as the morning sky
you leak light like paper white
the moment she started talking, i started walking
(i like the way you walk, ramona show me how to stop)
she whispered out my name, and my heart did nothing
(i like the way you walk, ramona show me how to stop)
the night was cold, and she started shaking
(i like the way you walk, ramona show me how to stop)
she held me by the hand and i fell for it again
dialing up your phone again,
hoping it's not too late
ramona show your thighs
show you're mine for the lucky eyes
as bright as the morning sky
you leak light like paper white
ramona show your thighs
show you're mine for the lucky eyes
as bright as the morning sky
you leak light like paper white
