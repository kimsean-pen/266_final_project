Come on baby, do you think it's good to feel,
Like I'm lying here swimming in memories?
I fear God because everything dies, babe.
Got a gun in the back of my car.
A spasm of good sense is making my eyes twitch.
I've had enough of all your consolation.

I'm drowning, caught in a shit tide,
Tape my face to the inside of love,
Nothing to eat but fears in the backseat,
Well I've met God and he had nothing to say to me.

I pray to God that you're right before my eyes,
Bathed in white light with halos in your eyes.

Don't want to waste no more time,
Time's what we don't have,
Everywhere I look someone dies,
Wonder when it's my turn.

How well do you know me?
Leave an open door. What you looking for,
Babe when you come down? (come down)
I built a time machine to escape from all the pain in the back of my car,
Living's a problem because everything dies babe,
Save yourself, you're not too far away

I pray to God that you're right before my eyes,
Bathed in white light with halos in your eyes.

Don't want to waste no more time,
Time's what we don't have,
Everywhere I look someone dies,
Wonder when it's my turn.

I pray to God that you're right before my eyes,
Bathed in white light with halos in your eyes.

Don't wanna waste no more time,
Time's what we don't have,
Everywhere I look someone dies,
Wonder when it's my turn.
