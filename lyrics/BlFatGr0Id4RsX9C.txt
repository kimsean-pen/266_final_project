Why don't you know?
You cannot leave
Before you get to go
You couldn't say
How it got this far
You couldn't find a way
You couldn't know
You were falling long before
You received the blow
You couldn't see
Anyone, least of all me
So you're threatening war
So go ahead and send it
So you're threatening war
So go ahead and send it
You know
You know
I know you know
Why don't you know?
You cannot fall
Once you get this low
You couldn't say
You always wanted
What would get away
You couldn't know
You were acting like the world
Was about to blow
You couldn't see
Anyone, least of all me
So you're threatening war
So go ahead and send it
So you're threatening war
So go ahead and send it
You know
You know
I know you know
You know
You know
You know
I know you know
We have no time
Deserting them
Just leaves this hand of mine
Oh can't you see?
You have someone
Least of all me
So you're threatening war
So go ahead and send it
So you're threatening war
So go ahead and send it
You know
You know
I know you know
