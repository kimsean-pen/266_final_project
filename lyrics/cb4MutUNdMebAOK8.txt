Maybe this was meant to be
Maybe now it should be me
Been dreaming of this forever
But I'm feeling so confused, yeah
It's hard to see what's right between you and I
And I don't know what to do
Oh we'd stay together always is the promise we made
But suddenly it's not so clear
And Im being pulled both ways
And it's breaking my heart,
Tearing me APART
It's impossible to choose
What if I don't try, what if I do?
Everything that I've DREAMED right in front of me
If I win what would I LOSE?
How could I learn to live wondering what if?

Oh ooh.

Things WILL never be the same
No, no, maybe that's the price of fame
Been waiting for this forever
It's close enough for me to touch
But if I don't go for it,
I might always regret
But is it worth us breaking up?

Oh. We'd stay together always is the promise we made
But suddenly it's not so clear
And I don't know what to say

And it's breaking my heart,
Tearing me apart
It's impossible to choose
What if I don't try, what if I do?
Everything that I've dreamed right in front of me
If I win what would I lose?
How could I learn to live wondering?

What if I would have tried, I could shine even fly
I don't want to realize after it's too late no ooh,
And see it all PASS me by.
If I do, if I don't, will I ever really know
What the future could hold before it slips away?
Could be the chance of a lifetime.

And it's breaking my heart,
Tearing me apart,
It's impossible to choose
What if I don't try, what if I do?
Everything that I've dreamed, right in front of me
If I win, what would I lose?
How could I learn to live wondering what if?

I'm never going to say, what if
