I should have known that this would happen from the start
This kind of function's going to have to fall apart
I guess before I would have sworn that we were friends
And in this problem must award some logic trend

Well I still don't understand, what this whole thing's about
And all the words that you said, are somehow stuck in my mouth
This was going so well, but I don't know what I did
All I really can tell is
I've been hit!
I've been hit!
I've been hit!

Well there's only so much drama I can stand
This is just about as far as I will bend
So get your hands off my lapel, because I think it's time to go
You oughta know that or you oughta know

And I still don't understand, what this whole thing's about
And all the words that you said, are somehow stuck in my mouth
This was going so well, but I don't know what I did
All I really can tell is
I've been hit!
I've been hit!
I've been hit!

As I was falling down the stairs and out the door
I guess heard you yell my name, but I'm not sure
You know, before I could have sworn that we were friends
Somehow that's how these parties always seem to end

Well I still don't understand, what this whole thing's about
And all the words that you said, are somehow stuck in my mouth
This was going so well, but I don't know what I did
All I really can tell is that
I always get hit

And I still don't understand, what this whole thing's about
And all the words that you said, are somehow stuck in my mouth
I guess I might take it back, but I'm not sure what I did
All I know for a fact is
I've been hit!
I've been hit!
I've been hit!
