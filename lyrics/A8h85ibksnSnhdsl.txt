That's the sound of humanity melting away
Say goodbye, it's the end of days
Fire rains down on the American dream
Watch all you love seethe and scream

Each will dig their own graves
And bury themselves in life's failures

It's our bombs we've masterminded lighting the skies
Hideous misfires, many die
Those who survive soon will suffocate
By the poisons we create

Each will dig their own graves
And bury themselves in life's failures
Detonation, detonation

When civilization crumbles man will turn
On one another, killing true

The darkest of times will then come to be
Through our selfish killer instincts

And now the ground we called our home
Is but a barren wasteland
And now the ground we called our home
Is but a barren wasteland
The only sound drowning your cries
Is the detonation

It seems we're running out of time
It seems we're running out of time
All good as dead, just stand in line
All good as dead, just stand in line
It seems we're running out of time
It seems we're running out of time
All good as dead, just stand in line, stand in line

And now the ground we called our home
Is but a barren wasteland
The only sound drowning your cries
Is the detonation
