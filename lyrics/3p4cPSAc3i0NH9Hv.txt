There's no sense in me staying
Then why does it matter?
(It doesn't matter, it never matters)
I hope someday soon maybe we'll finish this chapter
(I can't ever finish this chapter)
And now at this moment I don't know what else to think
There's no sense in me saying
"I guess I still miss you"
So now I need names and faces
Examine the suspects
Get the D.A here now
You'll tell everyone
That it's so much fun
Say to all my friends
It never ends
While we're driving through
All the alley ways
We picked up some happiness on the way
I'll tell everyone
That it's so much fun
Say to all your friends
It never ends
While we're driving through
All the alley ways
I picked up some happiness on the way
Just because you move your hips
Doesn't mean that you exist
Just because you move your lips
Doesn't mean that you exist
Can we just take
A fucking break
Cause I feel like I have got nothing left
Nothing left
I guess I still miss you
Oh well, it's me and you
What else should we do?
When talking is for functioning people
I guess I still miss you
But talking is for functioning people
I guess I still miss you
You always said
We'd win the lottery someday
So I wouldn't have to go away
I should have known
That I had it all along
But I didn't know till you were gone
Let's see you
Function now
Touch your nose
Jump around
Footprints, in God we trust
Jes-you, Jes-Me Jesus
Pick up ten sac orange crush
Two bottles, cups, and blunts
What do scorned lovers do?
Dancing with all my crew
Drink and drive life away
Gamble with everyday
Just because you move your hips
Doesn't mean that you exist
Just because you move your lips
Doesn't mean that you exist
Can we just take
A fucking break
Cause I feel like I have got nothing left
Nothing left
I guess I still miss you
Oh well, it's me and you
What else should we do?
When talking is for functioning people
I guess I still miss you
But talking is for functioning people
I guess I still miss you
You always said
We'd win the lottery someday
So I wouldn't have to go away
I should have known
That I had it all along
But I didn't know till you were gone
You always said
We'd win the lottery someday
So I wouldn't have to go away
You always said
We'd win the lottery someday
So I wouldn't have to go away.
