I smell like weed and perfume
I'm not fucking with your function
I've had enough
I used to love you like Jasmine
I used to love you like Jasmine
But you don't want my body, baby
But you don't want my body, baby
You don't want my body, baby
She don't want my body, baby

I just saw you for the first time last week
I don't know you, you don't know me
I cannot get you out of my mind
I think of you almost every night

Caught up like bottles from the water ride, a wave we go
I heard about this in a dream, a cliff for me to go
Smoke a vine, feel the vibe, then rewind, yeah
This kind of life, forseen they stay my house, they kneeling woah
Girl it's physical, yeah, girl it's physical
Close my eyes, explore the vibe until it's finished, oh
I know I'll find you, where I left you, when I want you, oh
Just spend some time to realize it's me you're fiending for

But you don't want my body, baby
But you don't want my body, baby
But you don't want my body, baby
But you don't want my body, baby
