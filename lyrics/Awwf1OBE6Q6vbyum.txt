Hey you, get off my cloud,
You don't know me and you don't know my style
Gettin' lifted, never come down
Gettin' lifted, unh,

Gettin' dumb on the drum, rum pum pum pum pum
Better run where I come, whata bum bum
Sippin' on coke and rum gettin' so crunk
Everyone wonderin' where she come from?
Got gold on my necklace, gold on my wrist
Girls gettin' mad cause their boys wanna kiss
Fast with the cash I just throw it in the bag
Everything I wanna have, well I think you get the gist

Upside downside,
Inside outside,
Hittin' you from every angle there's no doubt,
Poetry in motion, Coast to coast and,
Rub it in your skin like lotion, lotion

I got myself a 40,
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted,
Yes, I'm about to go get lifted
I got myself a 40,
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted,
Yes, I'm about to go get lifted

H-U-F-F, Huff and I puff,
Blow like snow when the cold wind's blowin'
Zoom, I hit the mic like Boom
Wrote a song about it, like to hear it? Here it goes
Style will hit you, wham! then goddamn...
You be like, "Oh shit, that's the jam!"
Turn it up, now hear me get buck wild wild,
I'm about to blow, light me up

Upside downside,
Inside outside,
Hittin' you from every angle there's no doubt,
Poetry in motion, Coast to coast and,
Rub it in your skin like lotion, lotion

I got myself a 40,
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted,
Yes, I'm about to go get lifted
I got myself a 40,
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted,
Yes, I'm about to go get lifted, Hey

Hey you, get off my cloud,
You don't know me and you don't know my style
Gettin' lifted, never come down
Gettin' lifted, never come down
Hey you, get off my cloud,
You don't know me and you don't know my style
Gettin' lifted, never come down
Gettin' lifted, unh!

I got myself a 40,
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted,
Yes, I'm about to go get lifted
I got myself a 40,
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted,
Yes, I'm about to go get lifted.
