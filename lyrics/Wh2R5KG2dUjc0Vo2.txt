Come to find the apple in your eyes
Dont confine the emptiness inside
Dont decide that everythings alright
And this time, we dont give up the fight
Unless Im told
Im just a little bit afraid
Of what you'll say to me
Im just a little bit afraid
Of what you'll say to me
Look in town
I wear a coat no more
Through the cloud
A rivalry installed
Wondering what you are dreaming now
Im so high, while you are on the ground
Dont be lost and found
I know Im just a little bit afraid
Of what you'll say to me
Im just a little bit afraid
Of what you'll say to me
Everything you see
Everything you knew
Youre so real
Im just a little bit afraid
Of what you'll say to me
Im just a little bit afraid
Of what you'll say to me
Im just a little bit afraid
Of what you'll say to me
Im just a little bit afraid
