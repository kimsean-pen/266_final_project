I'll say this once again
You people you aren't my friends
The devil he can't come in
Tonight, that's right

Looking for misery
But she found me
Lying naked on the floor
I was headed insane
The devil told me his name
But he's not welcome here
Anymore

Tell me what do you see
(What do you see)
When you're looking at me
(When you look at me)
This social responsibility
Is killing me
Inside, yeah

Looking for misery
But she found me
Lying naked on the floor
(Stay away, sweet misery)
I was headed insane
The devil told me his name
But he's not welcome here
Anymore

Stay away sweet misery
Stay away sweet misery

The pressure's building with time
I made it up in my mind
I've got excused for all these things
That I tried in my life

Looking for misery
But she found me
Lying naked on the floor
(Stay away, sweet misery)
I was headed insane
The devil told me his name
But he's not welcome here
Anymore
Stay away sweet misery
You're not welcome anymore
Stay away sweet misery
