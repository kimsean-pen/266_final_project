Weigh down
Weigh down
On the way down

I've lived the argument
So much so you don't know who I am
They know ...

Though my hands are made of stone
And I break everything I say
They save me from myself
And they say my name

Weighed down on the way down
I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe
And I might drown on the way down

I'm sick of all the come downs
Don't tell me that there's nothing wrong
I'm weighed down, weighed down

I fought for chain, fought for you
I'll take your edge, I'll carry on
I've been weighed down for far too long

Though my hands are made of stone
And I break everything I say
They save me from myself
And they say my name

Weighed down on the way down
I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe
And I might drown on the way down

I'm sick of all the come downs
Don't tell me that there's nothing wrong
I'm weighed down, weighed down

I won't be weighed down
There's too much resting on this
Live on the way down

Way down on the way down
I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe
And I might drown on the way down

I'm sick of all the come downs
Don't tell me that there's nothing wrong
I'm weighed down, weighed down

I fought for chain, fought for you
I'll take your edge, I'll carry on
I've been weighed down for far too long

Though my hands are made of stone
And I break everything I say
They save me from myself
And they say my name

Weighed down on the way down
I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe
And I might drown on the way down

I'm sick of all the come downs
Don't tell me that there's nothing wrong
I'm weighed down, weighed down
