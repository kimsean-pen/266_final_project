Whatever you do in life will be insignificant
But it's very important that you do it, cause
Nobody else will

Can't take back the cards you dealt on this long and lonely road to hell
The throne must be such a sad and lonely place
Living breathing flesh and blood, sweat and tears swept under the rug
I'm just a number to you, just ones and twos

The power keeps you feeling high but how low
Do you sink into your bed at night
(And go down with guilt)
Do you toss and turn from all the bridges you've burned
Or are you proud of all, the hatred you've earned

A conscience buried deep beneath, a heart stuck in a skeleton of greed
And eyes that can't see that happiness is so far out of reach

The power keeps you feeling high but how low
Do you sink into your bed at night
(And go down with guilt)
Do you toss and turn from all the bridges you've burned
Or are you proud of all, the hatred you've earned

You can only get so far
With no one by your side
A dark storm lies ahead
(Lies ahead)

Can't take back the cards you dealt on this long and lonely road to hell
The throne must be such a sad and lonely place
The power keeps you feeling high but how low
Do you sink into your bed at night
(And go down with guilt)
Do you toss and turn from all the bridges you've burned
Or are you proud of all, the hatred you've earned
