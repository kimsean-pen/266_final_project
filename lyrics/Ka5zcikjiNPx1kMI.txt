Harvest the field of time
With the old man's scythe
The narrow path of the chosen one
Reaches beyond life

I set sails for the ageless winds
No fear of dying or a thought of surrender
I threaten every barrier on my way
I am bound forever with token of time

Among the humble people
Everything is torn apart
But I'm blessed with faith
And bravely I shall go on

I set sails for the ageless winds
No fear of dying or a thought of surrender
I threaten every barrier on my way
I am bound forever with token of time

Are thou the bringer of hope and joy
That I've waited for years, I shall fight to restore the moon
Wisdoms of time are carved on the sacred wood
Wisdoms of time are carved on the sacred wood

Do thou possess spiritual powers
That would dispel all my fears, I shall not die until the seal is broken
Token of time is trusted in the hands of the chosen
Token of time is trusted in the hands of the chosen one

I set sails for the ageless winds
No fear of dying or a thought of surrender
I threaten every barrier on my way
I am bound forever with token of time

I set sails for the ageless winds
No fear of dying or a thought of surrender
I threaten every barrier on my way
I am bound forever with token of time
