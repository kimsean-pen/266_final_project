바람에 날려갔으면
강물에 실려갔으면
무심히 나를 베었던
기억들이 떠나갔으면
보이지 않는 선들이
지워졌으면

훨훨 날아갔으면
모든 게 꿈이었으면
뭐든지 할 수 있는걸
없던 일이 될 수만 있다면
Time
Papercut you gave me
Just a papercut you left me
Papercut you gave me
Just a papercut you left me

Papercut
Cut
Papercut
Cut

I did my best to read your eyes
To read between your pretty lies
But now I'm such a wreck, you see
For me it's already the end of time

Papercut you gave me
Just a papercut you left me
Papercut you gave me
Just a papercut you left me

Papercut
Cut
Papercut
Cut
Papercut
Cut
Papercut
Cut

All this time you gave me
Nothing left to keep
But it's time to let you go
To see you in your dreams
