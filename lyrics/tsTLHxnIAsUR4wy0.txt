Empty hearts I can hear them talking
I close my eyes and I keep on stalking my love, my love
No one's aware of the hunger I feel
It's something you or time cannot heal
I need someone to help me rise above

Eternal bliss is something I can show you
Spread your arms and let my wings enfold you, my love, my love
In the darkness shades of crimson rapture
The world is ours alone to capture my love, my love

Come over here and let me tell you something
Nothing ever comes of nothing
We pay a price for all our choices made
Come along now and take my hand
I'll lead you to a promised land
The morning after may never come again, will never be the same

Come over here and let me tell you something
Nothing ever comes of nothing
We pay a price for all our choices made
Come along now and take my hand
I'll lead you to a promised land
The morning after may never come again, will never be the same
