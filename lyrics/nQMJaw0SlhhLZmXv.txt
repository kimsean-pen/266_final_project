These streets are crowded with cowards disguisded as men
They are paying no consequence for their actions
Soon we'll all give in

I say the same things over and over and over again
But you act like you never heard them
We were created to set and example
So what is this, what is this?

This is the same old story
This is the same old scene
We're living our lives right out of a magazine
I guess we'll never know

Have we gone from little to less
To nothing at all, nothing at all?
It seems like every soul has been sold for a dollar or less
I guess we'll never know how good it could have been
How good it could have been

Savor every breath that enters your lungs
I promise it won't last forever
And by the time you realize
You were wrong, you'll be far gone

Savor every breath that enters your lungs
I promise it won't last forever
And by the time you realize
You were wrong, you'll be far gone

Follow me or back out now
Follow me with all your heart or back out, back out now

We all swim in a sea of pride where character is rare
(Where character is rare)
With every passing day it only gets worse
And no one seems to care

We all die wondering what if I
What if I would have tried?
And while your begging for life on your knees
You'll realize you were never happy

Have we gone from little to less
To nothing at all, nothing at all?
It seems like every soul has been sold for a dollar or less
I guess we'll never know how good it could have been

The clouds begin to move in rhythm
There is a storm in the sky

I will cause a disaster
Create an earthquake
And watch as you shake
I will cause a disaster
Watch as you shake

We all die wondering what if I
What if I would have tried?
What if I would have tried?
I guess we'll never know

It seems like every soul has been sold for a dollar or less
I guess we'll never know how good it could have been
How good it could have been
