She spreads herself wide open to let the insects in
She leaves a trail of honey to show me where she's been
She has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin
Seeds from a thousand others drip down from within

Oh my beautiful liar
Oh my precious whore
My disease my infection
I am so impure oh

Devils speak of the way in which she'll manifest
Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress
Need to contaminate to alleviate this loneliness
I now know the depths I reach are limitless

Oh my beautiful liar
Oh my precious whore
My disease my infection
I am so impure oh

Oh
Oh my beautiful liar
Oh my precious whore
My disease my infection
I am so impure
Oh my beautiful liar (no no noo no no no no)
Oh my precious whore (no, no, no, nooo, ohhh)
My disease my infection (no no no no noo noo no)
I am so impure (no, no, no, no no, noo ahhh)
