Breathing in now,
I try counting my blessings.
Picturing the last time I said.
Beg forgiveness,
With some words that mean nothing,
Illusions like smoke in my breath.

I come alive,
When I'm falling down.
I let myself go,
'Til I hit the ground.
When I'm there, at the edge,
In this moment I feel it I know.
Come alive when I'm falling down.

Air is thin now.
While my lungs are collapsing,
Vertigo blankets my head.
Far from reckless,
When I'm comfortable, thought
That I know I could never forget.
(That I know I could never forget)

I come alive,
When I'm falling down.
I let myself go,

'Til I hit the ground.
When I'm there, at the edge,
In this moment I feel it I know.
Come alive when I'm falling down.
(Yeah!)

Keep your distance,
Far away from me.
Watch this eat me alive
Keep your distance,
Far away from me
Watch this eat me alive.

I come alive,
When I'm falling down.
I let myself go,
'Til I hit the ground.
When I'm there, at the edge,
In this moment I feel it I know.
Come alive when I'm falling down.

I come alive!
I come alive!
I come alive!
I come alive!
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
(I come alive, I come alive)
