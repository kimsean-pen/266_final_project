Dance with me for I'll be leaving soon
The afterbirth on the keypads overwhelm
"Did he who make the lamb make thee?"
Help me find its origin

In a cartoon house
With a cartoon car
There are cities buried underneath our cities
"Let the people be free", "Let the people be free"
It's all around us

Dance with me for I'll be leaving soon
The afterbirth on the keypads overwhelm
"Did he who make the lamb make thee?"
Help me find its origin

In a cartoon house
In a cartoon car
There are cities buried underneath our cities
"Let the people be free", "Let the people be free"
It's all around us
It's all around
"Let the people be free", Let the people see

We so obviously had another hand and so separate
How do I act like I've made this
When I, when I, when I
When I... so obviously had another hand

Now, dance with me for I'll be leaving soon
The afterbirth on the keypad overwhelm
"Did he who make the lamb make thee?"
What happens when we reach for each other?
