You are sick and tired
Tired of everyone, yeah everyone
You are old and tired
You're older now, yeah you're older now

You can't just
Just open fire
Just open fire on everyone

If only you knew what you put us through
Why did you put us through all that you've got?
If only you knew what you put us through
Why did you put us through all that you've got?

Why can't you stop all this madness?
Just look us in the eye
Come on just look us in the eye

You can't just
Just open fire
Just open fire on everyone

If only you knew what you put us through
Why did you put us through all that you've got?
If only you knew what you put us through
Why did you put us through all that you've got?

So tell me that you've had enough

If only you knew what you put us through
Why did you put us through all that you've got?
If only you knew what you put us through
Why did you put us through all that you've got?

So tell me that you've had enough
