Pain!
Made to order!
Pain!
Made to order!

Pain!
Made to order!
Pain!

I'm not the second coming,
I'm the first wave
Better get an army,
'Cause the fire left me unscathed

You bet your bottom dollar,
I'm the top of the shit pile
So stick around,
'Cause I'll get to you in just a few

Step off the Achtung,
Get back or get stung.
Idiotic sense of yourself,
Are you that dumb?

Entire legion of me,
Totalitarian
The one and only motherfucker,
Top of the world man

'Cause I can't stand it, planned it,
Gonna crash land it
In other words,
Consider me branded

Another version of me,
Another version of you
Both barrels,
What you're gonna do?

All I hear is human noise!
You made your own fucking choice!
I belong to only me!
Silence for my revelry!

I can only die over time!
Filthy hands, stay away from mine!
Every reason is a right to hate!
Painful clutch!

Death is fine, give me mine!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!

Somebody explain this!
You don't care 'cause you don't exist!
What the fuck, is this another joke?
Reckoning!

Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!

Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
Only one of us walks away!
