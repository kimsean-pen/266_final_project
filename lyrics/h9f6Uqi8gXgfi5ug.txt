First they tell you that they love you
Then they ask where you coming from
Like you the only one feeling how you feeling
Then you lie just to make it sound appealing
To him and her and even the family
That you keep close, just to blow the steam like Stanley
You the one that have to plunge in the back
Praying people in the front don't figure where you at
I get that, used to pray for the feeling, now I miss that
I was stuck for a while, I'll admit it
The same damn thing, did you feel it man, I get it but
I'm past that now, I sip this crown now I mix no sprite
Only sip brown when I'm cooling with my niggas
So bitch go figure, its that kind of night, alright?

I love you, the things that cross my mind
While I'm by myself
I hate you, these things go through my mind
While I'm by myself
I fuck you, these things run through my mind
While I'm by myself
I fuck you, it's always on my mind
Think I need some help

Maybe if I had some diamond rings and nicer things
And wider cream, and smaller dreams, the simple things
It would have brought money more quickly
Maybe they get the picture
But even then still snapping for my niggas
So I'm always on the phone tryna make sense of figures
Cause the nigga that got that never been the one to spend it
You get it? Neither do I
The thought suicide for the money
We just call it being hungry nowadays
Every nigga getting paid, just a couple getting laid
If the chest fall right and the dick alright
Can I stay all night?
I can lie pretty well
Cause you posting all of my songs
Knowing pussy gonna sell

I love you, the things that cross my mind
While I'm by myself
I hate you, these things go through my mind
While I'm by myself
I fuck you, these things run through my mind
While I'm by myself
I fuck you, it's always on my mind
Think I need some help

I love you, the things that cross my mind
While I'm by myself
I hate you, these things go through my mind
While I'm by myself
I fuck you, these things run through my mind
While I'm by myself
I fuck you, it's always on my mind
Think I need some help
