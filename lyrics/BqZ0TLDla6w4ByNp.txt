INSTRUMENTAL
i won't eat until you say that you love me
i won't sleep until you can't sleep without me
i won't breathe until i take your breath away
i want to be alone but i want you to stay

i won't eat until you say that you love me
i won't sleep until you can't sleep without me
i won't breathe until i take your breath away
i want to be alone but i want you to stay

i won't be free
until i die
