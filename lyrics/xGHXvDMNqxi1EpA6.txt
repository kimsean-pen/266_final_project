I have drunk the yearning
Swallowed the flame in full
And now I will bend the skies to my will
Two eternities can never be so far apart
That I could not bridge them together

I hear the unsaid thoughts
The silence through the storm
I speak without the words
With unbound soul
I'll bring forth the sun
And hand over the moon
I'll hide the evening stars
And fold them in your heart

I have touched the longing
Breathed the wistful air
If I wish, I will turn the winters to spring
Through the dust and fear
I find the faintest light
And I can see life
A midst the death that wreaths us all

I hear the unsaid thoughts
The silence through the storm
I speak without the words
With unbound soul
I'll bring forth the sun
And hand over the moon
I'll hide the evening stars
And fold them in your heart

Here at your feet
I rest my head
Hear the roar of time
The birth of stars

Here at your feet
I rest my head
Hear the roar of time
The birth of stars

This is the gift of man
The key to see it all
The hidden wonders
Hope in despair

This is the gift of man
The key to see it all
The hidden wonders
Hope in despair

But only the few will find it
Only the few will keep it
Only the few will ever turn towards the sun
