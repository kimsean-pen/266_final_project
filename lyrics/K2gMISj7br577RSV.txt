You wake up every morning looking for your answer
You're waiting for your sign
While Jeremiah's on his way to tell the people
But you watch him pass you by

You walk the streets at night still looking for your reason
But you don't want to try
You swear the world has got you backed into a corner
But no one holds your hand to walk into a fight

You swear the light is gonna find you
But it can't find you if you're waiting all the time

You say, 'keep my head from going down'
Just for a little, just for a little
Watch my feet float off the ground
Just for a little, just for a little
A little love if you can hear this sound
Oh just give me something
Something to believe in

You spend your days alone still hoping for the truth, oh
But all you hear are lies
But no one else is going to tell you what to do now
No one else is going to help you hold the line

Sometimes it's hard to keep on living
But you're the one who's go to know just when it's right

You say, 'keep my head from going down'
Just for a little, just for a little
Watch my feet float off the ground
Just for a little, just for a little
A little love if you can hear this sound
Oh just give me something
Something to believe in

Love, come take me now
Love, come take me
Love, come take me now
Love, come take me, take me now
Come take me, take me now
Come take me, take me now
Come take me, take me now

You say, 'keep my head from going down'
Just for a little, just for a little
Watch my feet float off the ground
Just for a little, just for a little
A little love if you can hear this sound
Oh just give me something
Something to believe in

Something to believe in
Love, come take me
(Something to believe in)
Love is gonna take me, take me, take me
Something to believe in
Love is gonna come and save me
Love is gonna save me

You say, 'keep my head from going down'
Just for a little, just for a little
Watch my feet float off the ground
Just for a little, just for a little
A little love if you can hear this sound
Oh just give me something
Something to believe in
