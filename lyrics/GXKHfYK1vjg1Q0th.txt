You make me smile with my heart...
Ohhh...

Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop, man, I tried the best I could but...
You make me smile...

What's your addiction?
Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two but all three
She's got the same thing about me but more about us
So she's coming over so I guess that means I'm a drug
Just let me peek now, I mean, damn! I'm so curious
She's got a lover so the lies and the lust is a rush
Time's of the essence I need you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja, henny and C-Coca-Cola
And I'm c-coming over, 'cause it's n-never over

Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop, man, I tried the best I could but...
You make me smile...

I see the emotion in your eyes that you try not to show
We get the closest when you high or you drunk or you blow
So I pour the potion so we could both get high as we can go
Then I'll get the lotion and do something to me
When your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now I need you to undress and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe when the doors get closed
Roll up the doja, henny and C-Coca-Cola
And I'm keep' c-co-ming over, 'cause it's n-never over

Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop, man, I tried the best I could but...
You make me smile...

You make me smile...
You make me smile with my heart...
Ohhh...

Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop, man, I tried the best I could but...
You make me smile...

I just wanted to ask you...
Just wanted to... Uhm...
Let how would I put this... Uhhh
Let's say... all your friends
Remember the one?
You said if you ever she would be the one...
Okay, okay, okay...
Well...
I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean, don't take this seriously
Don't take me... I mean just â€“
Uhh, not credibly
I'm feeling incredibly
I mean let's set it, baby
Uh, just let it be!
I mean, you're haunting me!
I mean you are in me!
Maybe! Baby! Baby!
Baby! Baby!
You know, I was just kidding...
Unless you gon' do it...
You make me smile...
