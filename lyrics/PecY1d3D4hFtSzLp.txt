Leaves were flying all around
The day that you came into town
When you called, at my door
The wind was howling loud and clear
But the world around us disappeared
And time, stood still

I thought we had forever
I thought we were
But it was only an autumn tale
It was only an autumn kiss
The world was so full of bliss
For a moment I felt I was your one
But it was only an autumn tale

It was only an autumn tale
It was only an autumn tale

But it was only an autumn tale
