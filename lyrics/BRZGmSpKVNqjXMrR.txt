Say my name
No beautifying filters
I'm craving that honest pain
These perfect lines
Are always out of place
Only you and I were born to break the chain

Caught in the framework
Dying to belong
Escape the wasteland
Don't forget who you are

Amnesiac
Don't let the world revolve around you
Don't wait another day
To re-erase your memory
Amnesiac
Don't let the dream dissolve without you
The more you know
The more they hold you back
Amnesiac

Mortal peace
Pushing through a needle
Observing your every move
A thousand lies
To avoid the question why
Cause the more you know
The more they hold you back

Caught in the framework
Dying to belong
Escape the wasteland
Don't forget who you are

Amnesiac
Don't let the world revolve around you
Don't wait another day
To re-erase your memory
Amnesiac
Don't let the dream dissolve without you
The more you know
The more they hold you back
Amnesiac

No beautifying filters
Beyond the perfect lines
This effortless intrusion
Stop, erase, rewind

Escape the wasteland
Don't forget who you are

Amnesiac
Don't let the world revolve around you
Don't wait another day
To re-erase your memory
Amnesiac
Don't let the dream dissolve without you
The more you know
The more they hold you back
Amnesiac
