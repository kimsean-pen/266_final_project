Mountains may move, river may run
But you make me be myself, you make me be
How do I tell you, how do I tell

Stars may move, time may run
But you make me free myself
But you make me free
How do I tell you, how do I tell
You're the one, you're the one

In the world's eye, we were Laurel and Hardy
In our minds, we were Heathcliff and Cathy
In a moment of wisdom
We were a wizard and a witch

In a moment of freedom
We were Don Quijote and Sancho
In reality, we were just a boy and a girl
Who never looked back

How do I tell you
How do I tell you
How do I tell you
How do I tell you
How do I tell you
How do I tell you
How can I tell you
How could I tell you
