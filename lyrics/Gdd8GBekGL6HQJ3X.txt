Lonely
your embrace is disappeared
Slowly
your smells disappeared
Suddenly

indulge in old memories
Scattered pieces of old flame
Keep knocking the door

Tell me
if you're not alone
If there's someone now
I don't wanna bother more
Please answer me
I don't wanna disappear
In your whole world
Like I didn't past
...
Oh
Please answer me
I don't wanna disappear
In your whole world
Like I didn't past
