Benedictus
Halleluja

Warfare, pain and murder
in Golgatha we stand
for the last rite of heaven
the seventh sacrament

Born of blood and fire
and blessed by midnight's hand
in the core of the pyre
no sorrow we repent

And we ride by the storm
in the night we're reborn
and we carry our hearts to the dome
To the Bible we're sworn
in the dark we transform
and we die
by the dawn all alone

In the night we can't rest
in the dark we are blessed
and in moonlight we fight for the father
We are brave to the heart
blood and fire we part
and forever we pray for we are

Blessed and Possessed
Blessed and Possessed
Blessed and Possessed
Halleluja

Cursed by our desire,
and guided by our lust
holy father in heaven,
in sacristy we trust

Blessed before the altar,
no life in celibate
for the call of the wicked,
the wicked we await

And we die by the sword
undead life our reward
and we carry our lust all alone
To the Bible we're sworn
in desire transform
we're not blessed
when undressed to the bone

In the night we can't rest
in the dark we are blessed
and in moonlight we fight for the father
We are brave to the heart
blood and fire we part
and forever we pray for we are

Blessed and Possessed
Blessed and Possessed
