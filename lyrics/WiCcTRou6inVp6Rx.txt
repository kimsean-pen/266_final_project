Sometimes you get sad when we're together
Because you're not sure if you'll miss me when I'm gone
Just try to appreciate what you got while you got it
So if it ever goes away, you can say you enjoyed it while it lasted
Sometimes I don't feel like singing, I don't really like these songs
Sometimes I don't feel like dancing, DJ please don't turn the beat on

Let's keep it quiet, keep me honest, and keep me true
Keep me in love; keep me believing it's with you
But who's gonna push my wheelchair around when I get sick?
God forbid I ever stop feeling sorry for myself, for being selfish

This is not the way I plan on living for the rest of my life
But for right now, it gets me by, it gets me by
It's reached the point in the night where I need to decide
Whether I'm gonna fall asleep or watch the sunrise

We're both into letting this develop
But the sound of starting over always sounded much better
But I won't stop this, and you won't stop this
It'll probably go further than either of us wanted
It all comes down to the fact that I don't care to
Sacrifice a good time 'cause someone says I have to
Next thing that I know, I am removing all my clothes

And you are dancing around the room to some song on the radio
You say I deserve it, all that's coming, the good and the bad
(Bad, bad, bad)
I don't regret it, how could it? You were the best I ever had
I ever had, I ever had, I ever had, I ever
Who's gonna push my wheelchair around when I get sick?
God forbid I ever stop feeling sorry for myself, for being selfish
This is not the way I plan on living for the rest of my life
But for right now, it gets me by, it gets me by
