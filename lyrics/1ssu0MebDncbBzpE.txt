Keep my heart inside your hands
beating leave it in your grasp.
Keep it, it's yours to understand
breaking, slipping through like sand.
I've taken my heart out,
'cause it don't beat the same no more
I've zipped my mouth shut,
'cause my words don't mean much at all.

I'm gonna lay down
until I fade out
I'll go to sleep now
don't lie to yourself, no.
I'm gonna wake up
and i'll stay up

and wonder why i'm lying on your pillow.

Keep my thoughts inside your hands
hold them, their yours to comprehend.
I've taken my lungs out,
'cause you are the air I breathe

To find out that her heart,
beats fine without me.

I'm gonna lay down
until I fade out
I'll go to sleep now
don't lie to yourself, no.
I'm gonna wake up
and i'll stay up
and wonder why i'm laying on your pillow
My body feels cold, in the night when you're so warm

When you stole the sheets on the sixteenth
I remember when you said,
" The night no longer feels as dark."

And my body feels cold, in the night when you're so warm.
When you couldn't sleep on the twenty-fifth
I remember when you said,
" The night has never felt so dark."
I'm gonna lay down
until I fade out

I'll go to sleep now, i'll go to sleep now.
I'm gonna wake up
and i'll stay up
and wonder why i'm lying on your pillow.

I'm gonna lay down
until I fade out
I'll go to sleep now
don't lie to yourself, no.
I'm gonna wake up
and i'll stay up
and wonder why i'm laying on your pillow.
My body feels cold, in the night when you're so warm
When you couldn't sleep on the twenty-fifth
I remember when you said,
" The night has never felt so dark. "
