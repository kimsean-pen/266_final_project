I've been feeling sick
Thinking sketchy shit, I
Haven't slept a wink in a week
Can't scratch this itch
Feeling like a fool
There's nothing I wouldn't do, 'cause
Love is crazy, I'm crazy too
I can prove it to you

I would fight a thousand fights
Lose my eyes, I'd take a life
I'd kill a man
Just to hold your hand
I would swallow broken glass
Give my right arm, swim with sharks
I'd die alone
Just to walk you home

I know it sounds extreme
I hope that you will believe me
I wish it wasn't true, but it is
I'm in too deep
I sit alone and think
Of all the stupid things, that
I would do to be near you
For a minute or two

I am the lock, you are the key
Hoping some day you'll turn 'round to me
'Cause after all, after all

I would fight a thousand fights
Lose my eyes, I'd take a life
I'd kill a man
Just to hold your hand
I would swallow broken glass
Give my right arm, swim with sharks
I'd die alone
Just to walk you home

I've been feeling sick
Thinking sketchy shit
I haven't slept a wink in a week
And I can't scratch this itch
I've been feeling sick
Thinking sketchy shit
Cause love is crazy, I'm crazy too
And I can prove it to you

I would fight a thousand fights
Lose my eyes, I'd take a life
I'd kill a man
Just to hold your hand
I would swallow broken glass
Give my right arm, swim with sharks
I'd die alone
Just to walk you home

I'd die alone
Just to walk you, walk you home
