Every day, every night
Feeling no better, feeling alright
Wearing it metal, harder than steel
Making it better by keeping it real

Hope

Every night, every day
Every action in every way
I am everything that you want me to be
Watch me learn

I am what I've become because I have no hope
No faith in your hope

Hope

Every day and every night
Infinitely moving through every finite
I am everything, I am everywhere
Watch me burn, watch me learn

I am what I've become because I have no hope
No faith in you
And we are not the same

Fire

We're a part of your life right now

I am what I've become because I have no hope
No faith in you
And we are not the same

Because I am what I am
I have learned
Respect
