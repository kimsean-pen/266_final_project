I saw you on a tree, you were looking at me
Your wings were bad and bleeding
Your tiny eyes were full of tears
(Oh, man, don't cry)

I stayed under the tree waiting for you to fall on me
You said "Hey, you should go!"
Your tiny eyes were full of tears
(Oh, man, stop crying)

You don't need to apologize if I catch you now
If you're falling down
