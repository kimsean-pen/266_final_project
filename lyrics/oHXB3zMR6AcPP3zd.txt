It's all a game of this or that, now versus then
They're better off against worse for wear
And you're someone who knows someone
Who knows someone I once knew
And I just want to be a part of that.

The road outside my house is paved with good intentions
Hired a construction crew 'cuz it's hell on the engine
And you are the dreamer, and we are the dream
I could write it better than you ever felt it

So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, and it's just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'till tonight do us part
I sing the blues and you swallow them too

My words are my faith, to hell with our good name,
We mix up your guts, your insides x-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
We're a bull, your ears are just a china shop

I love you in the same way, there's chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom, and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills
I could write it better than you ever felt it

So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, and it's just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'till tonight do us part
I sing the blues and you swallow them too

(Hum hallelujah, hum hallelujah)

A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'till tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too

So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, and it's just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'till tonight do us part

A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'till tonight do us part
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'till tonight do us part
I sing the blues and you swallow them too.
