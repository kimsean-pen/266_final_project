I wake up in the dark, there's no tomorrow
Someone said, we are lost
I wake up in the dark, there's no tomorrow
Someone said, we are lost
I look up at the stars they portent my sorrow
A thousand miles we drift apart
Can't you see I'm all broken hearted
All our love fades away
Carry the torch for me and give me something new
You said you wanted to but it's now long overdue
At the summit of perception a blackness starts to rise
At the summit of deception I look into your eyes
I gave you all my love, where did you follow?
I see no light in dark, there's no tomorrow
I see the way ahead where love lies fallow
I lost you on the way, all seems so hollow
In the twilight of our dreams, as bad as it seems
Sorrow 's hanging over me, the way it used to be
If only I could change the course, a change in degree
Take a look at your own life, the way you used to be
Carry the torch for me and give me something new
You said you wanted to but it's now long overdue
At the summit of perception a blackness starts to rise
At the summit of deception I look into your eyes
I gave you all my love, where did you follow?
I see no light in dark, there's no tomorrow
I see the way ahead where love lies fallow
I lost you on the way, all seems hollow
Can't you see? all comes back
Can't you see?, we don't connect
I gave you all my love, where did you follow?
I see no light in dark, there's no tomorrow
I see the way ahead where love lies fallow
I gave you all my love, where did you follow?
