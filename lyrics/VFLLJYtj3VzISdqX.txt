The quiet kid has come to stay
what did he say?
he says I'm lonely, says I'm lonely

I'll tell you everything I know
what do you know?
he says I'm hopeless, says I'm hopeless

And that's why I can't send you christmas cards
It's why I had to keep you in the dark
Less big words and more exclamation marks

The little king is locked away (locked away)
swallow the key
says it's alright, but not sorry

I'll tell you everything I saw
(what did you see)?
a hundred and one
he says it's alright, but I know what I've done

And that's why I can't send you christmas cards
It's why I had to keep you in the dark
Less big words and so...

Charmed but Destroyed
Opens up the window
Bored and Overwhelmed
I was overwhelmed
But that's the best part
That's the best part

'Cause I've been taking your advice
With a speak and spell
I could get to know you better
And never know you well

And that's why I can't send you christmas cards
It's why I had to keep you in the dark
Less big words and so...

Charmed but Destroyed
Opens up the window
Bored and Overwhelmed
I was overwhelmed
But that's the best part
That's the best part
