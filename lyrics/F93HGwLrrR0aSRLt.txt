Standin' by your window in pain
A pistol in your hand
And I beg you, dear Molly, girl,
Try and understand your man the best you can

Across the Great Divide
Just grab your hat, and take that ride
Get yourself a bride
And bring your children down to the river side

I had a goal in my younger days
I nearly wrote my will
But I changed my mind for the better
I'm at the still, had my fill and I'm fit to kill

Across the Great Divide
Just grab your hat, and take that ride
Get yourself a bride
And bring your children down to the river side

Pinball machine and a queen
I nearly took the bus
Tried to keep my hands to myself
They say it's a must, but who can ya trust?
Harvest moon shinin' down from the sky
A weary sign for all
I'm gonna leave this one horse town
Had to stall 'til the fall, now I'm gonna crawl
Across the Great Divide

Now Molly dear, don't ya shed a tear
Your time will surely come
You'll feed your man chicken ev'ry Sunday
Now tell me, hon, what ya done with the gun?

Across the Great Divide
Just grab your hat, and take that ride
Get yourself a bride
And bring your children down to the river side
