Frailty on to the surface
Rising as my wish came true
The trial overshadowed
By the thought of having you
Yet alone in the dark, in the night
The ache within my soul uproars
Leaving me heavier than ever
Caught inside somber world

Will the ache ever ease up
Is my soul beyond redemption
Left to walk the dark forlorn
From here to eternity
Sometimes I feel so alone
Like no one can see or feel
As a ghost trapped in limbo
The only one haunted is me
