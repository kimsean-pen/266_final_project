I'm gonna get out if it's the last thing that I do
And in my heart my fifteen minutes are burned through

I won't come back
To fall off track
The way that I survived
It's a violent world, but today I'm still alive

I need you to tell me everything will be alright
To chase away the voices in the night
When they call my name
Have I gone insane?

These thoughts'll kill me and everything that I hold true
And as I grow, I let my fear replace my youth

I won't turn back
I won't cross that hidden danger line
It's a loud and dark world
But I think I found the light

I need you to tell me everything will be alright
To chase away the voices in the night
When they call my name
Have I gone insane?

I need you to tell me everything will be alright
To chase away the voices in the night
When they call my name
Have I gone insane?

I need you to tell me everything will be alright
To chase away the voices in the night
When they call my name
Have I gone insane?
