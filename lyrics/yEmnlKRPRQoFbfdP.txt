Trudging forward, across the barrens
A life long lost, where has it gone
Right through my hands, now I am here
A walking shell, already dead

Show me the meaning of pain...
Tempt me with the promise of death
Cold winds from their icy hearts... turn us all to dust

Will breaker, courage taker
Leading us on, leading us nowhere
Taking its toll, the weak ones fall
Boundless journey, boundless nightmare

Can not find the light
Can not find the way
Humanity has left us
Abandoned us to fate

Can not move... can not breathe
Smell the death... see the horror
In front of me... the massacre of thousands
The mind can't erase, what the soul can't embrace

Dragging us into the dirt
Soaking the ground with our blood
Like beasts to the slaughter
We'll never leave here alive

Starved, stabbed, degraded and tortured
Crawling, gasping, there[s nothing leftDrained and beaten, slipping downwardFading fast, death has finally come]
