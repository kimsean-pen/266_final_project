Begging me to stay
I'm laughing in your face
So desperate not to let those years of care
Go to waste

But it was you who wanted love not romance
You have to pay the price
My body may be made of fire
But my soul is made of ice

I'm me, I'm cold
I'm cold, I'm told
I'd love to love you girl
My body, my body has just been sold

You're begging me to stay
But I'm laughing in your face
You're so desperate not to let those years of care
All go to waste

But it was you who wanted love not romance
You have to pay the price
You see my body may be made of fire
But my soul is made of ice

I'm me, I'm cold
I'm cold, I'm told
I'd love to love you girl
But my body, my body has just been sold

I'm me, I'm cold
I'm cold, I'm told
I'd love to love you girl
My body, my body has just been sold
