Tain't no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
Tain't no big thing
The toll of the bell

Aggravated, spare for days
Stroll downtown in the red light place
Jump up, bubble up, what's in store?
Love is the drug and I need to score

Showing out, showing out, hit and run
Boy meets girl and the beat goes on
Stitched up tight, can't stay free
Love is the drug, got a hook on me

Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug that I'm thinking of
Yeah, can't you see?
Love is the drug for me

Tain't no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
Tain't no big thing
The toll of the bell

Late that night I park my car
Stake my place in the singles bar
Face to face, toe to toe
Heart to heart as we hit the floor

Limbo up, limbo down
Locked embrace, stumble round
I say, "Go", he say, "Yes"
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest

Yeah, catch that buzz
Love is the drug that I'm thinking of
Yeah, can't you see?
Love is the drug for me

Tain't no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
Ain't no big thing
The toll of the bell

Aggravated, spare for days
I stroll downtown in the red light place
Jump up, bubble up, what's in store?
Love is the drug and I need to score

Showing out, showing out, hit and run
The boy meets girl and the beat goes on
Stitched up tight, can't stay free
Love is the drug, got a hook on me

Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug that I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see?
Love is the drug for me

Baby, got to catch that buzz
Love is the drug that I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see?
Love is the drug for me

Oh, I've got to catch that buzz
Love is the drug that I'm thinking of
Baby, can't you see?
Love is the drug for me, oh

Tain't no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
Tain't no big thing
The toll of the bell

Yeah, got to catch that buzz
Love is the drug that I'm thinking of
Oh yeah, can't you see?
Love is the drug for me

Yeah, I got to catch that buzz
Love is the drug that I'm thinking of
Got to, got to, got to, got to get that buzz
I've got to, got to, got to, got to get that buzz
I've got to, got to, got to, got to get that buzz

Gimme baby
Got to have that

Got to have that drug
Got to have that buzz

Got to have that drug
Got to have that buzz

Got to have that drug
Got to have that buzz
