Oh, for once in my
Oh, for once in my life
Could just something go
Could just something go right?

Oh, for once in my
Oh, for once in my life
Could just something go
Could just something go right?

I've been waiting all my life
I've been waiting all my life
All my life
My life

Oh, for once in my
Oh, for once in my life
Could just something go
Could just something go right?

I've been waiting all my life
I've been waiting all my life
All my life
My life
All my life
All my life

I've been waiting all my life
I've been waiting all my life

All my life (Oh, for once in my)
(Oh, for once in my life) My life
All my life (Oh, for once in my)
(Oh, for once in my life) All my life

(Oh, for once in my) My life
(Oh, for once in my life) All my life, all my life
(Oh, for once in my)
(Oh, for once in my life)

I could wait for hours
I could wait and never fall down
Never fall down, never fall down

Lays down beside the river
Face down beside the river
