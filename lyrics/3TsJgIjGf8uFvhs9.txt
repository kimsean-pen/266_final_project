All right I'll get straight to the point
I found marijuana in the house
And while I never thought of myself as the
type of father who'd have to drug test his kids
I'm willing to do just that if that's what it
takes to find out who brought a joint into this house
Dad, Lucy found something too
I'm pretty sure it should be Dad, I found the joint in Mom's chest of drawers
