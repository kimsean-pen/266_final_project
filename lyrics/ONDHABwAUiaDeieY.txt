Well, well, what do I say
Looks like what goes around comes around
And everyone will have their final say
Sometime, someday
Looks like I only love God when the sun shines my way
Looks like I'm into divinity only when I can see its sweet, sweet rays

Chorus:
I say what I mean but I don't mean what I say
Well, well, it's fine out today
I say what I mean but I don't mean what I say
Well, well, it's fine out

Well, well, what do I say
I've never seen a bad day look quite this way
And well, well, what do I do
When all of my thoughts run right back to you
Looks like I meant to speak with logic
But hon', the carnal always gets in the way
Well, well, this fire was more funner than proper grammar anyway

C h o r u s

Then you get to the part where your heart just wants to die
Then you get to the part where your heart screams it just sighs
Then you get to the part where your heart knows it's a crime
So it flies like a bird, it's heard, it's heard, it's heard the word

C h o r u s

Today, today, today, today
Well, well, it's fine out
