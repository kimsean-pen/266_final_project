Buster he sold the heat
With a rocksteady beat

An earthquake is erupting
But not in orange street
A ghost dance is preparing
You got to help us with your feet

If you're not in the mood to dance
Step back grab yourself a seat
This may not be uptown Jamaica
But we promise you a treat

Buster bowl me over
With you bogus dance
Shuffle me off my feet
Even if i kept on running
I'd never get to orange street

So i say there's not much left to say
For the man who set the beat
So i leave it up to you out there
To get him back on his feet

Buster bowl me over
With you bogus dance
Shuffle me off my feet
Even if i kept on running
I'd never get to orange street

Bring back the who is the we want the
Bring back the Prince
