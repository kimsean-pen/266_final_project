I've never felt so sober
I've never felt the low that I feel tonight
Your words made everything drag on, and on
I finally found her, and when I did I just couldn't make things right
Is this really happening?
Oh, God, I think I just ruined my life

What the fuck am I doing?
I can't tell the difference from wrong and right
I second guess my decisions
'Cause I haven't been this person in my whole life
I think I need something new here
When I keep longing for what I had
No need for second opinions
I do the best I can to ruin what I have
Come on

Don't think you've got to go in alone here
I've got nothing left to hide
you're dying, just make up your mind

I thought this was what you wanted
Someone who gets everything right (Gets everything right)
I thought this was what you wanted
Someone to put you first in their life
'Cause we're running out of time

Let's have three cheers for the new year
Hey, Hey, Hey
Here's to hoping it's not as bad
This wasn't part of my vision
The optimistic in me, swore we can make this last but no
You ruined my favorite records
Listen to them and I think of you
I just hope you remember
All the countless times I believed in you for what.

Don't think you've got to go in alone here
I've got nothing left to hide
You're dying, just make up your mind

I thought this was what you wanted
Someone who gets everything right
(Gets everything right)
I thought this was what you wanted
Someone to put you first in their life
'Cause we're running out of time

Just know that it kills me
When I hear anything to do with you
You won't see it, but believe me,
I need to be right where you are
And know that I'm leaving, leaving
And you won't hear til a year from now
And this kills me
'Cause now I think that everything, everything's about you

I thought this was what you wanted
Someone who gets everything right (Gets everything right)
I thought this was what you wanted
Someone to put you first in their life
'Cause we're running out of time
Don't think you've got to go in alone here
I've got nothing left to hide
You're dying, just make up your mind.
