ever since you were born you were
cold as the snow you were
so scared to melt you avoided the warmth
that your family had gave in the
same flowing breath that they
said I love you to death

do you live for the summer or spring?
because you don't feel like winter to me
you came through this town like a breeze
do you live for the summer or spring?

well the fear in my eyes made me
terribly blind made me
so scared to live made me stay inside
while the rest of the world
had continued to spin
I had no reason to live when I was sick

do you live for the summer or spring?
because you don't feel like winter to me
you came through this town like a breeze
do you live for the summer or spring?

mamma, mamma I'll make you proud
take these words, sing them out loud
and i won't stop until there's middle ground
and you said I know

since the day I arrived
this had already died
this is it, you were right
and you said I know.
