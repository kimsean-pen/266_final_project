I followed
Making flirty faces, rounding out the bases
So you'd borrow
Me for the night
Maybe for life

Endorphin orphan morphin
Lemon cheese equally
You know my origin story, born in the cemetery
I'm into stupid apps, like cry-yo-own self back to sleep
My rock is solidbucks, these people amenities

Must have you misunderstood little girl you're a dangerous lady
Just because it feels so good that don't make, that don't make you my baby

Fed me skittles on a burial ground
Gave me rabies in the back of my car
Shoved that dagger through the back of my heart
Now you're just another scar

Get another round of weirdo in 'em
Turn around slow and rear yo head
No one allowed to solve the riddle, ha
Now you're just another scar

Kiss my, kiss yo ass goodbye
Kiss yo ass goodbye
Kiss my, kiss yo ass goodbye
Kiss yo ass goodbye
Now you're just another scar

Only on occasion do I lose my patience
I just swallow, all of my pride
But I can't this time
Ohh

I test this cable, I plugged into a tree
I play the tokin tone from straight off the leaf
I got the smoothest roots that spew out the feet
There's a clue in a plant and it can bite off the teeth of disease

Fed me skittles on a burial ground
Gave me rabies in the back of my car
Shoved that dagger through the back of my heart
Now you're just another scar

Shoved that dagger through the back of my heart
Now you're just another scar

Get another round of weirdo in 'em
Turn around slow and rear yo head
No one allowed to solve the riddle, ha
Now you're just another scar

Kiss my, kiss yo ass goodbye
Kiss yo ass goodbye
Kiss my, kiss yo ass goodbye
Kiss yo ass goodbye

Kiss my, kiss yo ass goodbye
Kiss yo ass goodbye
Kiss my, kiss yo ass goodbye
Kiss yo ass goodbye

Kiss my, kiss yo ass goodbye
Kiss yo ass goodbye
Kiss my, kiss yo ass goodbye
Kiss yo ass goodbye
