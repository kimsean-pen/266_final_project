the evidence will lend itself to be more than just a lie.
I'm not asking much, just a simple request that you think for yourself, once in this goddamn life. Fuck!

Forward.
The violent state of mind obsolete and taking the back seat.
Reach for the stars, control the fucking skies.
Can you silence your opinion of what I'm about to say?
Go on and let the mind perceive.

Neglect the sense of ignorance to alter life.
Embrace the beauty from inside.

WE ARE ONE.
We are the strength of the universe at heart.
Construct the light.
Implore of the energy, bestow the understanding.

Follow the scent of the sinners as the body of our mind disintegrate.
Forever is the course upon your plate.
Don't ever ask if we consume the blood and hate.
Repeat this life if you will, but don't count on forgiveness from the filthy swine.

Here we stand at the threshold of paradise, stealing a new world.
I never would have thought our place in history would come to this, but we are infinite.

WE ARE ONE.
Neglect the sense of ignorance to alter life.
Embrace the beauty from inside.

WE ARE ONE.
We are the strength of the universe at heart.
Construct the light.
Implore of the energy, bestow the understanding.

WE ARE ONE.
We are the strength of the universe at heart.
Construct the light.
Implore of the energy, bestow the understanding.
