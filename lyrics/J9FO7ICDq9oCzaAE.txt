You will need more than prayers to cleanse humanity of this infection
Desiring what will one day destroy you .
This infatuation will lead to your demise as you seek a way out of your life,

This is the world of the dead
We tread along these shattered grounds in hope of purification against these ways.

You can almost taste the hatred
Like venomous creatures lurking in the shadows of this earth
Awaiting the craving that destroys you

This is the world of the dead
We tread along these shattered grounds in hope of purification.

This decaying world shall crack beneath our feet and diminish our population,
This infection will not stop spreading till we are all as good as dead.
