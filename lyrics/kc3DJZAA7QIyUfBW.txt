Cheer up
Honey I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with silvery stars
Honey kisses clouds of fluff
Shoulders shrugging off

Cheer up
Honey I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with radio cures
Electronic surgical works

Picking apples for the kings and queens
of things I've never seen
Oh distance has no way
Making love
Understandable

Cheer up
Honey I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with silvery stars
Honey kisses clouds of fluff

Picking apples for the kings and queens
of things I've never seen
Oh distance has no way
Making love
Understandable
Oh distance has no way
Making love
Understandable
Oh distance has no way
Making love
Understandable
Oh distance has no way
Making love
Understandable
Cheer up
Honey I hope you can
