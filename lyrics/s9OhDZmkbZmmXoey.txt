Night's gonna fall
Lettin' the stars shine through
And time on a wall
Bringin' me closer
To the one I want
I can't wait no more, no

Lost like a child
Even my knees are shakin'
Caught for a while
Under a wave that's breakin'
Over me
In his arms I float

When he looks at me that way
I know just what he'll say

Get ready, get set
You've seen nothin' yet
All day, all night
Here's somethin' you can't forget

I say get ready, get set
You ain't seen nothin' yet
All day, all night
Here's somethin' you can't forget

I could try
Imagining somethin' better than
You and I
Makin' sweet love together

Taking me much farther than before, yeah
And when I stop to feel this way
You'll know just what he'll say

Get ready, get set
You ain't seen nothin' yet
All day, all night
Here's somethin' you can't forget

I say get ready, get set
You ain't seen nothin' yet
All day, all night
Here's somethin' you can't forget

When he looks at me the way
I know just what he'll say

Get ready, get set
You ain't seen nothin' yet
All day, all night
Here's somethin' you can't forget

I say get ready, get set
You ain't seen nothin' yet
All day, all night
Here's somethin' you can't forget

Get ready, get set
You ain't seen nothin' yet
All day, all night
Here's somethin' you can't forget

Get ready, get set
You ain't seen nothin' yet
All day
