For now you love me while my face is young and body's strong
But one tomorrow they won't be there when tomorrow comes
Do you think that you'll love me even when the lovin' hurts?
You're captivated by a beauty that I didn't earn
I've been trying to believe it
Man, I mean it when I say that it is only worth it if it's real enough to trust
I know that it is only worth it if it's pure devotion
I would never ask for you to stay
Won't expect you to come with me
If you wanted to go a different way
Then I'd give you whatever you need
For now you love me but I don't know how you say you're sure
You understand that it's forever that you're asking for
I've done enough to know when I should learn from old mistakes
And fought enough to know how quickly what I do can fade
I've been trying to believe it
Man, I mean it when I say that it is only worth it if it's real enough to trust
I know that it is only worth it if it's pure devotion
I would never ask for you to stay
Won't expect you to come with me
If you wanted to go a different way
Then I'll give you whatever you need
Tell me anything, just not a lie
I won't try to control this
I mean it when I tell you it's not worth it unless it's pure devotion
