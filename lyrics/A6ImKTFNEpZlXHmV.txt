I don't want to be in this Wonderland no more
I don't want to be in this Wonderland no more

Keep it moving when I say so
Do you even know your way home
Look up to the heavens and pray, oh
Will I see another day? Ooh
Keep it trill by any means
See some shit you never see
White rabbits are everywhere
But you should come follow me
See this world, it isn't real
Swear this all must be a dream
Swear this all must be some fake shit
I'm used to being deceived
Look at me now

I don't want to be alone
Know what I need, right now
Will I end up all alone

I don't want to be in this Wonderland no more
I don't want to be in this Wonderland no more
I don't want to be in this Wonderland no more
I don't want to be in this Wonderland no more

Have you proven to have faith? Oh
Am I in a different space zone?
Running away without a trace, oh
Maybe I should just embrace Bars
Keep it true, no time for false
Keep it living, keep the post
True I've always kept it true
True I've always had the sauce
Getting tiring you know
Now my family need me home
Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Nowhere to go
All I know is

I don't want to be alone
Know what I need, right now
Will I end up all alone

I don't want to be in this Wonderland no more
I don't want to be in this Wonderland no more
I don't want to be in this Wonderland no more
I don't want to be in this Wonderland no more

Keep it moving when I say so (say so)
Do you even know your way home? (Oh, no)
Look up to the heavens and pray, oh (oh, Lord)
Will I see another day, oh? (Who knows?)

I don't want to be in this Wonderland no more
I can't afford to be here anymore, it's
It's not real, it's figment of my imagination
It's all pretty here and everything is lovely
Some fuck shit, too but real shit is happening and my people need me
And therefore, I'm out
