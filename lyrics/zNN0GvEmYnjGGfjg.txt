A reason, a victim
A shadow vacant in the sky.

You yearn for what's missing
Your power hidden in the night.

An angel, a demon
Your Gods you prayed on lonesome nights.

The damage, inflicted
The pain in us they leave behind.

Never give in
Never back down
Never give in!

We're soldiers, instinctive
We can bring change before we die.

Through tails of the demons
To feel what lies beneath our eyes.

Never give in
Never back down
Never give in
Never back down
When your life feels lost
(Fight against all odds!)
Never give in
(Never back down!).

Never give in
Never back down
Never give in
Never back down
When your life feels lost
(Fight against all odds!)
Never give in
(Never back down!).
