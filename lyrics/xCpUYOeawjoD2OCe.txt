Heard he was born as a beast and a ghost
On the East of a coast, where they eat you for jokes, uh
I know a guy who said his mom knew a man
Who's mother's sister saw him in the mall one time
Heard he was high and he rode to the sky
And it opened and God played a song he recorded
He wrote it down
But he only play the record for his wife sometimes
Heard he survived, on an island with Vikes
That provided with Valkyrie, sirens, and pirates
Don't know the guy, yeah uh
But they talk about his verses in the night sometimes

Big reign, the sixth, the seven
Hey hey, the King, the Legend
Bang bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the King, the Legend
Big reign, the sixth, the seven
Hey hey, the King, the Legend
Bang bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the King, the Legend

Heard he was formed from the lights that are Northern
The rock that's above, though he once got an offer
From Lucifer's daughter to bow to the gods
So he keep his verses sharper than a knife sometimes
Heard he was worn, not a hero that's torn
Between fame and adornment and loses his sword
So he shot the fame down
But he keep a mask on him if the sign's in the sky
Heard he was happy so no one could gas him
Or force him to dance like a monkey for access
He loves his life
But he keep a pen sharp enough to write one time

Big reign, the sixth, the seven
Hey hey, the King, the Legend
Bang bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the King, the Legend
Big reign, the sixth, the seven
Hey hey, the King, the Legend
Bang bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the King, the Legend

He struck down gods that he killed and armies
Stood up on top of a hill of bodies
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself
Put up both hands, made the lightning come down
Rep got so big that it blocked the sun out
It was never enough
He just needed saving from himself (Woah)
It was never enough
He just needed saving from himself
It was never enough
He just needed saving from himself
He just needed saving from himself
It was never enough
He just needed saving from himself (The King, The Legend)
He just needed (The King, The Legend)
It was never enough
He just needed saving from himself (The King, The Legend)

The King, the Legend
Himself
The King, the Legend
The King, the Legend
