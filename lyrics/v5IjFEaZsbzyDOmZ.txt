Am I just wasting my time?
Two years and still uninspired

Am I awake
You say your feeling tired
I don't wanna fight it
If there's a flame we could put a light in

We're getting too close
I don't wanna let you in
I think its time that
We let go
Before I break your heart again

He's against my rules
Or anything that could've happened
Cuz baby we were getting too close
I don't wanna let you in
We're getting too close

I've watched you make all the plans
My ideas just make you mad
Didn't expect you to just wash my hand

I don't wanna fight it
If there's a flame we could put a light in
We're getting too close
I don't wanna let you in
I think it's time that
We let go
Before I break your heart again

He's against my rules
Everything could've happened
Cuz baby we were getting too close
I don't wanna let you in
We're getting too close

Where do we go
Where do we go from here
Where do we go
Where do we go from here

We're getting too close
I don't wanna let you in

We're getting too close
I don't wanna let you in
I think it's time that we let go
Before I break your heart again

Guess he was against my rules
Everything could've happened

We're getting too close
I don't wanna let you in
We're getting too close
I don't wanna let you in
I think it's time that we let go
Before I break your heart again

Cuz baby we were getting too close
I don't wanna let you in
We're getting too close

Where do we go
Where do we go from here
Where do we go
Where do we go from here
