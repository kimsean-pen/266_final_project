Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you
If you're young at heart

For it's hard you will find
To be narrow of mind
If you're young at heart

You can go to extremes
With impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams
Fall apart at the seams

And life gets more exciting
with each passing day
And love is either in your heart
Or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth
To be young at heart

For as rich as you are
It's much better by far
To be young at heart

And if you should survive to 105
Look at all you'll derive
Out of being alive

And here is the best part
You've had a head start
If you are among the very
Young at heart

And if you should survive to 105
Think of all you'll derive
Out of being alive

And here is the best part
You've had a head start
If you are among the very
Young at heart...
