I came home last night
You switched on the light
Strange but familiar view
So, I talk back at you

I take a straircase and walk to the moon
When I open my eyes I'm in my room

I came home last night
Left all things behind
Then I made paper planes
And I watched the fire dance

I take a straircase and walk to the moon
When I open my eyes I'm in my room
I take a straircase and walk to the moon
When I open my eyes I'm in my room
