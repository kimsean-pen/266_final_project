This is my first affair, so please be kind
Handle my heart with care, oh please be kind
This is all so grand, my dreams are on parade
If you'll just understand, they'll never never fail
So tell me your love's sincere, oh please be kind
Tell me I needn't fear, oh please be kind
For if you leave me dear, I know my heart will lose its mind
If you love me, please be kind
This is my first affair, so please be kind
Handle my heart with care, oh please be kind

If you'll just understand, they'll never never fail
So tell me your love's sincere, oh please be kind
Tell me I needn't fear, oh please be kind
For if you leave me dear, I know my heart will lose its mind
If you love me, baby, if you love me, baby
If you love me
If you love me, if you love me
If you love me, baby, baby, baby
If you love me
If you love me, baby, please be kind
Please, please, please be kind
If you love me, baby, please be kind
