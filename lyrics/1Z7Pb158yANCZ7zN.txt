Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia, Georgia, a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out to me, other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see the roads leads back to you

Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind

Other arms reach out to me, other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see the roads leads back to you

Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
