Our love is like water
Pinned down and abused
For being strange
Our love is no other
Than we alone
For me all day
Our love is like water
Pinned down and abused

All over you, all over me
The sun, the fields, the sky
I've often tried to hold the sea
The sun, the fields, the tide
Pay me now, lay me down

Our love is like water
Pinned down and abused
For being strange
Our love is no other
Than we alone
For me all day
Our love is like angels
Pinned down and abused

All over you, all over me
The sun, the fields, the sky
I've often tried to hold the sea
The sun, the fields, the tide

Pay me now, lay me down
Pay me now, lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

All over you, all over me
All over you, all over me

Pay me now, lay me down
Pay me now, lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay
(SOLO)

Our love is like water
Pinned down and abused
For being strange
Our love is no other
Than me alone

All over you, all over me
The sun, the fields, the sky
I've often tried to hold the sea
The sun, the fields, the tide

Pay me now, lay me down, down
Pay me now, lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay
