Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you!
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you!
Desperately seeking someone willing to travel
You're lost in conversation and useless at Scrabble

Happiness will never last
Darkness comes to kick your ass
So lets dance to all of this
War is over for a bit
The whole world should be moving do your part
Cure lonely heart
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you!
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you!

We're sold on vanity but that's so see through (see through)
Take your body to the floor, your disco needs you

From Soho to Singapore, from the mainland to the shore
So lets dance through all our fears
War is over for a bit, you're a slave to the rhythm to your heart

You're a lonely heart
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh

Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
Ah-aaaahhhhhhh
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
Ah-aaaahhhhhhh
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you!
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you!

Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you!
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you!
Ah-aaaahhhhhhh
So lets dance through all our fears

War is over for a bit, the whole world should be moving to your heart
You're a lonely heart
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you!
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you!
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you!
Your disco, your disco, your disco.
Needs... YOU!
