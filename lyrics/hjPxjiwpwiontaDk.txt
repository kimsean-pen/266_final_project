Yellow love, meet the sunglasses on my eyes
On my eyes
Never let anyone see the things I hide
Show me what it feels like
They don't know me just like you do
But you don't love me like you used to
So let's just ride like we used to do

I, I just wanna feel right
And I

I don't wanna be let down
But I don't wanna let you go
Baby we can take it fast
And maybe we can drive real slow
In my pink Cadillac
In my pink Cadillac

Looking for the attention that gets me high
All the time
All I need for the moment is all your time
Show me what it feels like
They don't know me just like you do
But you don't love me like you used to
So let's just ride like we used to do

But I don't wanna let you go
Baby we can take it fast
And maybe we can drive real slow
In my pink Cadillac
In my pink Cadillac

Super flashy, superficial
I just wanna feel official
Super flashy, superficial
Show me what it feels like
Super flashy, superficial
I just wanna feel official
Super flashy, superficial

I don't wanna be let down
But I don't wanna let you go
Baby we can take it fast
And maybe we can drive real slow
I don't wanna be let down
But I don't wanna let you go
Baby we can take it fast
And maybe we can drive real slow
In my pink Cadillac
In my pink Cadillac
In my pink Cadillac
