Always not to exaggerated fights
Or to defy
Go away like you always do your entire life
You're saying bye

Fool in the night
Wake in the night
Oh let me go, old dinosaur
From the right to the wrong
settle

For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)

Haunted all this time
Don't know how to fly
We know you're there
Flashlight as your guide
Sticky from your dye
Unfurling hair

Fool in the night
Stay in the night
Oh let me go, old dinosaur
From the right to the wrong
settle, settle
Cover me with your long feathers
When I die
Circle me in your long feathers, feathers, feathers, feathers

For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)

So alive though our wolves might talk about it every day
Don't want to say no more now
'Cause we ain't gonna lie to you
(We're writing cursive to)
Our signs, our water slides

For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)

Don't don't
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
(say stop, made up)
Lying on the bathroom floor
