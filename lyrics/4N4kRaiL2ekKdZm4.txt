All in all I don't know what to believe
But I told my friends I'm not sure if they're real
And I'm peering in mirrors for proof that I'm here

Half in, half out of this broken machine
Sick to the bone with some spectral discease
Came back from the void with the void still in me

Oh, how I wish I was here

Watching my life on a detuned TV
The pictures I see are just shapes on a screen
Come shock me out of my slow motion dream

Here comes another day still within the fade-out
And I'm freaking out
Don't let this be what I'm about, I'm about
Oh, how I wish I was here

All it would take is a whisper or a kiss
To seal my fate within the abyss

Anaesthesia
All is seeing, self deceiving
I'll find a way home
Oh, how I wish I was here
Acid mother, Resin father, I am blind
