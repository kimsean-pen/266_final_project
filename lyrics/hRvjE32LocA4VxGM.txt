You come home late and you come home early
You come home big when you're feeling small
You come home straight and you come home curly
But sometimes you don't come home at all

So, what in the world's come over you?
What in heaven's name have you done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there runnin' just to be on the run

I've got a heart that burns like a fever
And I got a worried and a jealous mind
How can a love that would last forever
Get left so far behind?

So, what in the world's come over you?
What in heaven's name have you done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there runnin' just to be on the run

It's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow
'Cross the evil line today
How can you ask about tomorrow
When we ain't got one worth to save?

What in the world's come over you?
What in heaven's name have you done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there runnin' just to be on the run
You're out there runnin' just to be on the run
You're out there runnin' just to be on the run
