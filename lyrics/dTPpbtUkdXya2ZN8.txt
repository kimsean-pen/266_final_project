Baby boy, your face is pretty
And your life's a toy
Master man, I'm never better
Than your latest plan

Poor Donee,
What are you gonna try to be
Where are you gonna go without me now

I've been you mother, I've been your father
Who can ask me for more
I've been your sister, I've been your mistress
Maybe I was your whore, who can ask me for more

Superstar, I've tried to educate
Your childish heart
Made your bed and I was in it
When your faith was dead

Poor Donee, what are you gonna try to be
Where are you gonna go without me now

I've been you mother, I've been your father
Who can ask me for more
I've been your sister, I've been your mistress
Maybe I was your whore, who can ask me for more

Sweetie pie, I'm you personal pro, you know
You know what number to try, when to cry

I've been you mother, I've been your father
Who can ask me for more
I've been your sister, I've been your mistress
Maybe I was your whore

I've been you mother, I've been your father
Who can ask me for more
I've been your sister, I've been your mistress
Maybe I was your whore, who can ask me for more
You can ask me for more
