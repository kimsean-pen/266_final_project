(You better think again)
Yeah

(Verse 1)
Looking inside, digging in deep
Holding on tight to all that is me (No one takes me down, no one takes me down)
Don't you think for one day, that you can kill me
I'm not a pawn, I am the king (I'm not going down, I'm not going down)
I am the king (I'm not going down)

(So you better think again)

(Chorus) (2x)
You make me, you break me
You build me up and tear me down

Just let me go.

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

(Verse 2)
Tonight's defense stands at the gate
It's your move now, I sit and wait (I'm not going down, I'm not going down)
I sit and wait (I'm not going down)

(So you better think again)

(Chorus) (2x)
You make me, you break me
You build me up and tear me down

Just let me go!

You make me, you break me,
You build me up

You make me, you break me,
You build me up

(Chorus) (2x)
You make me, you break me
You build me up and tear me down

Why am I? Why am I?
Why am I yours and you're not mine?

Just let me go
(Why am I?)
Just let me go

You make me, you break me
You make me, you break me
You make me, you break me
You break me
