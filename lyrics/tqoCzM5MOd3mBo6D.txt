For what it's worth I think there's
nobody like you
You've got grace got a heart beating and despite
you're fun
As I grew up I was terrified of darkness
Now you're around I've no reason
to be frightened

'Cause even if the sun came tumbling down
You light the ground I walk on
Even if the moon fell out of the sky
You light the ground I walk on

Now that you're mine I can't
picture life without you
You're my friend,
you're my lover wanna bite you

'Cause even if the sun came tumbling down
You light the ground I walk on
Even if the moon fell out of the sky
You light the ground I walk on

The world goes on spinning and I can't retrace
My heady footsteps to this place
I'm in heaven right now
and I don't want to come down

'Cause even if the sun came tumbling down
You light the ground I walk on
Even if the moon fell out of the sky
You light the ground I walk on

Now we're alone gonna show
how much I need you
Kiss you so you won't ever wanna leave me

'Cause even if the sun came tumbling down
You light the ground I walk on
Even if the moon fell out of the sky
You light the ground I walk on

'Cause even if the sun came tumbling down
You light the ground I walk on
Even if the moon fell out of the sky
You light the ground I walk on
