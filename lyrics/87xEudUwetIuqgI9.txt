I don't know just when you get down
But I know it's not when you're eating
And everyday is like your birthday
With all the get ups and the weird smiling

The day you couldn't get your head in the dark door
Couldn't get my brain in your belly
When you could find it with a flashlight
But you did that already

It's so easy to replace it
Somethings have more, much more than cars and girls
An evening in an iron maiden
Morning in your funny little world

It's a weird little birthday
It's a weird little song
She's a weird little girlfriend
We don't really get along
