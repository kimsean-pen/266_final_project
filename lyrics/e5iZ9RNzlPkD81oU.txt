Can't you see?
There's a feeling that's come over me
Close my eyes
You're the only one that leaves me
Completely breathless

No need to wonder why
Sometimes a gift like this you can't deny

'Cause I
Wanted to fly
So you gave me your wings
And time
Held its breath so I could see
Yeah
And you set me free

Ooh
There's a will
There's a way
Sometimes words just can't explain
This is real
(This is real)
I'm afraid
(I'm afraid)
I guess this time there's just no hiding, fighting
You make me restless

You're in my heart
The only light that shines there
In the dark
Oh

'Cause I
Wanted to fly
So you gave me your wings
And time
Held its breath so I could see
Yeah
And you set me free

When I was alone
You came around
When I was down
You pulled me through
And there's nothing that
I wouldn't do for you

'Cause I
Wanted to fly
So you gave me your wings
(So you gave me your wings)
And time
Held its breath so I could see
(So I could see)
'Cause I
Wanted to fly
So you gave me your wings
(So you gave me your wings)
And time
Held its breath so I could see
Yeah
And you set me free
