We used to walk up in the sky
Up where the air is rarefied
Went hand-in-hand from cloud to cloud
But when I slipped up, we fell out

And I'm sorry I let you down
Down to the ground
But who cares now?

We could be up in the clouds
Up in the clouds
We could be up in the clouds

Dizzy from lack of oxygen
Or from the mood you put me in
Up in the cloudy stratosphere
Gravity's weaker when you're near, my dear

And I'm sorry I let you down
Down to the ground
But who cares now?

We could be up in the clouds
Up in the clouds
We could be up in the clouds
Up in the clouds
Up in the clouds

Yeah. ohh. yeah
Yeah. ohh. yeah

We could be up in the clouds
Up in the clouds
We could be up in the clouds
Oh, to be up in the clouds
We could be up in the clouds
Up in the clouds
