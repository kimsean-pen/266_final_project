She's taking her time making up the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smiles and the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one
They're saying
Mama never loved her much

And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection, but
Somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come

(And she'll say to him)
She's saying
I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby
Ooh-ooh
She can't remember a time

When she felt needed
If love was red then she was colour blind
All her friends would have been tried for treason
And crimes that were never defined
She's saying
Love is like a barren place
And reaching out for human faith is
It's like a journey I just don't have a map for
So baby gonna take a dive and push the shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars
(What a pleasant dream) just saying
I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby
Hold on (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
Hold on
Mama never loved her much and
Daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection, but
Somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come
(And she'll say to him)
Just sayin'
I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby
I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby, yeah!
Ooh-ooh
