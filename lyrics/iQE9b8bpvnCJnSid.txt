Walked in for a good time, had me at hello
Tried to steal me from my girl, cause you wanted me alone
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause you never met a girl like me
And you said you know how to treat a lady
Hurry up, speed it up, no time for shows
I said i'm leaving, in the morning
And you can love me, till i'm gone
If you're catchin' feelings, in the morning
I'll be on my way back home
Ooh, ooh na na na na na

And you wanna do it all with me, yeah
Speed it up, no time for shows
I said i'm leaving, in the morning
And you can love me, till i'm gone
If you're catchin' feelings, in the morning
