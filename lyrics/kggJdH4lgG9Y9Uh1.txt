Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Oh, oh, oh
Take oasis, Marat's bathing
We walk through the wood, we walk
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Oh, oh, oh
Take oasis, Marat's bathing
We walk through the woods, we walk
Take oasis, take oasis
Take oasis, take oasis

Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Oh, oh, oh
Take oasis, Marat's bathing
We walk through the world, we walk
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Oh, oh, oh
Take oasis, Marat's bathing
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Oh, oh, oh
Take oasis, Marat's bathing

Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Oh, oh, oh
Into the, oh, oh, into the, oh, oh
Up, up, up, up, up, up
Up, up, up, up, up, up
