Oh, oh woah-oh

So dangerous, like freedom she fades away
The vision that chains the heart
Foundations that fall apart
Well, I know this place (east, west, points to the nation)
(North, south, cut the connection)

I said, stealer, steal her, we cross the border
Steal love, still life, we cross the border

And time builds the wall, the wall that is standing still
And she breaks the spell, the spell that may hold us all
You build stone by stone, the line that will last for so long
But for those who dare, her secret is safe with no-one
Well, I know this place (east, west, points to the nation)
(North, south, cut the connection)

I said, stealer, steal her, we cross the border
Steal love, still life, we cross the border, oh, oh whoa-oh

Oh, oh, oh

I said, stealer, steal her, we cross the border, mmm, mmm
Steal love, still life, we cross the border, oh, oh whoa-oh

Chk-a-chk-a...(east, west, points to the nation)
(North, south, lines of persuasion break)

I said, stealer, steal her, we cross the border, mmm, mmm
Steal love, still life, we cross the border, oh, oh whoa-oh
Stealer, steal her (east, west, points to the nation)
We cross the border, mmm, mmm (north, south, lines of persuasion break)
Steal love, still life (east, west, points to the nation)
We cross the border (north, south, cut the connection break)
Steal love, steal her (east, west, points to the nation)
We cross the border, oh yeah (north, south, lines of persuasion break)
Steal love, still life (east, west, points to the nation)
We cross the border (north, south, cut the connection break)
Stealer, steal her (east, west, points to the nation)
We cross the border, oh (north, south, lines of persuasion break)
