Papa's faith is people
mama she believes in cleaning
papa's faith is in people
mama she's always cleaning
papa brought home the sugar
mama taught me the deeper meaning
she don't like my kick pleat skirt
she don't like my eyelids painted green
she don't like me staying up late
in my high-heeled shoes
living for that rock'n'roll dancing scene
papa says "leave the girl alone, mother
she's looking like a movie queen"
Mama thinks she spoilt me
papa knows somehow he set me free
mama thinks she spoilt me rotten
she blames herself
but papa he blesses me
it's a rough road to travel
mama let go now
it's always called for me
sometimes i get that feeling
and i want to settle
and raise a child up with somebody
i get that strong longing
and i want to settle
and raise a child up with somebody
but it passes like the summer
i'm a wild seed again
let the wind carry me
