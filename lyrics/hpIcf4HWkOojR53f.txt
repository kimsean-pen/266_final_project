There's nothing more i'd like than to have you hold me
As i spill my blood on your milk white skin
There's nothing left for me here and what could be better
but to lay here with you and die in your arms

To Die In Your Arms Is My Pleasure
My Blood On You i Will Treasure

The world is killing my soul and you can save me
Nothing greater than to share my end with you
When i pass cover me in Black Lace with your Black Lips Kiss My Face
When you feel my heart stop you can say a prayer

To Die In Your Arms Is My Pleasure
My Blood On You i Will Treasure
And When i Look In Your Eyes
i Say Good Bye

Fell so, so cold
Feel Myself Letting Go

To Die in your arms is My Pleasure
My Blood On You i Will Pleasure
and when i Look in Your Eyes
i Say Good Bye
