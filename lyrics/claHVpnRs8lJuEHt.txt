A man in dream
A growing theme
Believed, then it came true
A thought, a sense
With no defense
Believed, then it came true
So bittersweet
The innocence
But buried deep in vigilance

You're holding on to what you know
'Cause what you loved died a long time ago

And what if we could look inside and see what lies behind?
And what if we could step inside and open our mind?

And silently we keep on dreaming
And silently we keep on dreaming

The day when you
When we would do
But couldn't make a choice
A wonder lies
In mirrored eyes
And silence in their voice

And every time we stay alive
Forget to dream and take our time
We lose a piece of ourselves
And every day we hide away
Lose sight of what we meant to say
We lose a piece of ourselves

And what if we could look inside and see what lies behind?
And what if we could step inside and free our mind?

And silently we keep on dreaming
And silently we keep on dreaming
And silently we keep on dreaming

And I believe
Oh I believe
And I believe
Oh I believe
And I believe
Oh I believe
And I believe
Oh I believe
Oh I believe
Oh I believe

And silently we keep on dreaming
And silently we keep on dreaming
And silently we keep on dreaming, oh, oh
