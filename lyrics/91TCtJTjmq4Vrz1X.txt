I hate this war
Can't take any more
It's a real gas
How long does it last
I don't wanna die for England
I don't wanna die at all
I I I I OOOO
I I I I OOOO
I got my uniform
Now it's battle torn
I'm wet and I'm cold
What a way to grow old
I don't wanna die for England
England will survive
I I I I OOOO
I I I I OOOO
I I I I OOOO
I I I I OOOO
I don't wanna die for England
I don't wanna die at all
I don't wanna die for England
Didn't hear the bugle call
