I know it for sure
Alive doesn't mean living
I'm a whale on the shore
But I'm still breathing
It makes you upset
It makes you upset
It makes you upset
It makes you upset

All I see's a box of crayons
I'm focused on my eyes to see through
All I see is that every color is blue

We lower our heads
To be like willows
We just wanna step
Right out of the window
It makes you upset
It makes you upset
It makes you upset
It makes you upset

All I see's a box of crayons
I'm focused on my eyes to see through
All I see is that every color is blue

All I see's a box of crayons
I'm focused on my eyes to see through
All I see is that every color is blue

You work, you work, you work, you work
You work and then you'll die
You work, you work, you work, you work
You work and then you'll die
You work, you work, you work, you work
You work and then you'll die
You work, you work, you work, you work
You work and then you'll die

All I see's a box of crayons
I'm focused on my eyes to see through
All I see is that every color is blue

All I see's a box of crayons
I'm focused on my eyes to see through
All I see is that every color is blue
