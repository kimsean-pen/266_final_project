Right love the wrong intention, Some things will never change
I'll keep my soul if you can promise the same
Someday I'll fly away, Countdown from 10 for a brand new day
This year is over and I'm feeling like a rolling stone

One mistake at a time
Until you learn to keep it all condensed and buried deep inside
It hurts so little at first but it gets better in time
My heart is only my mind, Oh and now its gone

There's got to be a better way to show what I'm feeling
All for a name I won't ever say
I miss the glamour of your camera flash
You're gonna need it when the lights go down

Let go and make believe we're singing in the streets
You're only happy when you're making a scene
Well that's just fine with me, I'm never one to disagree
The year is over and I'm feeling just as dandy again

That's okay, but your timed
'Cause you're never gonna see another morning without me
You're just a little, Oh you're just a little too shy
I think I will be alright now here I go

There's got to be a better way to show what I'm feeling
All for a name I won't ever say
I miss the glamour of your camera flash
You're gonna need it when the lights go down

Oh yeah!

Oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
ah ah ah ah ah ah

There's got to be a better way to show what I'm feeling
All for a name I won't ever say
I miss the glamour of your camera flash
I only need it when I'm coming down

I start to think I'm crazy every day after New Year's
She said: "I need those Florida stars"
I miss the glamour of your camera flash
You're gonna need it when the lights go down
