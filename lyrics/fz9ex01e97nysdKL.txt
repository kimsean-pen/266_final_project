All this time I felt so lost, lost and needed help
Incomplete, out of reach, alone all by myself
It all becomes so clear when I see your face
And it's only when you're near, I feel I'm safe

So before we take this road, 'fore you change my mind
And fill my heart with hope, help me to believe this time
I've been torn apart, desperately tryin' to find
A way back to my heart, so I can love again
Help me to love again, oh, yeah

I'm so tired of holding on, so tired of waiting
I need to feel something real without it breaking
It all becomes so clear when you touch my hand
And it's only when you're near, I know you understand

So before we take this road, 'fore you change my mind
And fill my heart with hope, help me to believe this time
I've been torn apart, desperately tryin' to find
A way back to my heart, so I can love again

There's a fire within me, but I don't know where to stop
There's light beginning, there's a dark kind leaving
There's a hope I'm feeling now

So before we take this road, before you change my mind
And fill my heart with hope, help me to believe this time
I've been torn apart, desperately tryin' to find
A way back to my heart, so I can love again
Yeah, turn the page to love again
