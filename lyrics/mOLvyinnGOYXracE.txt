I knew from the very first time I saw you
You like crying in your room for something to do
With your hands on my body, tell me what we just started
All I know is I don't want you to go
There's something in my mind
It tells me every time, don't fall in love with you tonight

Well what if I came in close to wanna kiss you
Would you say no?
Is it really me that you want, that you want?
Is it really me that you want, that you want?

Nobody knows about you and I
How we watch television and kiss sometimes
Every time you're in the room I see nothing, nothing but you

Well what if I came in close to wanna kiss you
Would you say no?
Is it really me that you want, that you want?
Is it really me that you want, that you want?

I don't wanna be just your friend
But I know that this is gonna end
I don't wanna be just your friend
But I know that this is gonna end
But I know that this is gonna end, gonna end
Don't want it to end
But I know that this is gonna end

Well what if I came in close to wanna kiss you
Would you say no?
Is it really me that you want, that you want?
Is it really me that you want, that you want?

I don't wanna be just your friend
But I know that this is gonna end
I don't wanna be just your friend
But I know that this is gonna end
