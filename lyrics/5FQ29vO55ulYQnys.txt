I pray that I can see
Beyond this life tormenting me
Tempting from inside
Come hysteric thoughts of pain
Slowly I'm consumed
Into emptiness I fall
When all my body's cold and dead
Will the feelings be the same
Will my kingdom comfort me
Of reject my languid soul

Stagnant cooling blood
Starts to coagulate
My body weakens and sinks
As my soul discorporates

Ressurected from the souls of the damned
Comes the fury of their dismay
Ungodly images unveiled to me
Creations from below
My body rot within it's grave
My soul now free to roam

I begin to seek
What's been taunting me
My lifeless corpse
No longer blinding me

My incarnate life no more
My existence now deceased
Now what I am gone
I exist in misery
My unpleasant renization
And my suffering begins
Salvation never reacehd
And my kingdom never found

Starts to coagulate
My body weakens and sinks
As my soul discorporates

Ressurected from the souls of the damned
Comes the fury of their dismay
Ungodly images unveiled to me
Creations from below
My body rot within it's grave
My soul forever roam
