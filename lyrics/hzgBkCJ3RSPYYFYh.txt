Whoa whoah woooooo
Whoa whoah woooooo
I had lost that love, that love, that love before
Dark mind (?) and I close, and I close, and I close the door
And you say, Try just once more
And you came and you took control
You touch my very soul
You always show me that
Lovin' you is where it's at
You've made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
The others were untrue
But when it came to loving you now
I'd spend my whole life with you, girl
Coz you came and you took control
You touch my very soul
You always show me that
Lovin' you is where it's at
You've made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
Whoa whoah woooooo
Whoa whoah woooooo
I had lost that love, that love, that love before
Dark mind (?) and I close, and I close, and I close the door
And you say, Try just once more
And you came and you took control
You touch my very soul
You always show me that
Lovin' you is where it's at
You've made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
Whoa whoah woooooo
Whoa whoah woooooo...
