New phone on the seat
Fancy rental car
Need no directions
When you know by heart

The low slung houses
Between Hilda's and our old house
Driving my favorite route

Tracing the grid at night
Valley floor, incandescent light
I'm orbiting North Mountain pretty close
Not even half a life
The march you made is wide
I never dreamed that I would find another way home

Around the table
Aunts and uncles are all there
Communicating so animatedly
My favorite stories
I've memorized them all
They showed me how I'd always be

Tracing the grid at night
Valley floor, incandescent light
I'm orbiting North Mountain pretty close
Not even half a life
The march you made is wide
I never dreamed that I would find another way home

Someone is calling me
Someone is following
Someone is finally listening
