There is no afterlife
Only this
There is no afterlife
Only this

I have gazed upon these skies for a lifetime or more
The fiercest stars, collapsed on heaven's floor
Airless and silent, the pathway from hell, destination endlessly far
Still, attempt to traverse through the black and frozen time

Behold the portal to the light
A tale of hope for those to die
With sings so cold and muscles tense, I could not make the journey's end
With no blood left in my veins to bleed, and no tears left to shed

Never had I felt so alone
Taste this bitter darkness

This universe of emptiness that lies within us
That we lie within, and reside in awe and wonder
Stretching through matter and time unending
A beautiful mystery eternally unsolved

Become the dreamless, reach the void and see
Into the emptiness that birthed and denied me
Forsaken, we shall accept this as our truth
Dreaming in the language, but longing for our youth

Evasive is the ecstasy of sleep
I reach for that horizon, forever just out of reach
To cross the threshold into darkness

There is no afterlife
Only this
There is no afterlife
Only this
There is no afterlife
Only this
There is no afterlife
Only this
