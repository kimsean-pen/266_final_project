You know, I was
I was wondering, you know

If you could keep on
Because the force
It's got a lot of power
And it make me feel like ah
It make me feel like... oooh!

Lovely, is the feeling now
Fever, temperatures rising now
Power (oooh power), is the force the vow
That makes it happen, it asks no questions why

So get closer (Closer now)
To my body now

Just love me
Till you don't know how

Ooooh
Keep on with the force don't stop

Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Touch me, and I feel on fire
Ain't nothing, like a love desire
I'm melting (I'm melting now)
Like hot candle wax,

Sensation (Oooh Sensation)
Lovely where we're at (Oooh)
So let love, take us through the hours
I won't be complaining (uuuh)
Cause this is love power

Ooooh

Keep on with the force don't stop

Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop

Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

(Oooooooooh)
(Woah baby)

(Keep on)

Heartbreak, enemy despise
Eternal (Oooh Eternal)
Love shines in my eyes
So let love (Oooh let love), take us through the hours

I won't be complaining (Oooh no)
Cause your love is alright, alright

Ooooh

Don't stop 'til you get enough
