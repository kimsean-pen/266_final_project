Make up your mind

Attention fiend get away from here (don't want you here)
Don't bother these eyes are already set on another
Attention fiend always trying to be seen
You'll never get in my head, I'll never let you win

Show your true Colors make sure they're bright
We wouldn't want to miss out this time

Attention fiend get away from here (don't want you here)
Don't bother these eyes are already set on another
Attention fiend always so dry and thirsty
You'll never prey on me, I'll burn you to the ground

Taking the time to change up the scene
get up and use your mind
Taking the time to get up and see,
get up and live your life

Make up your mind
Show your true Colors now
Let them shine

The limelight shines and it's all eyes on you
Soak it in soak it in
Now let the games begin
Attention fiend why won't you let me be
You'll never prey on me I'll burn you
To the ground

Taking the time to change up the scene
get up and use your mind
Taking the time to get up and see,
get up and live your life

Make up your mind
Show your true Colors now
Let them shine

Wake up, face the light,
we're running out of time

Now look at what you
You have done
Now look at what you
You've become
