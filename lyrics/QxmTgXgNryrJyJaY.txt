Exile
It takes your mind... again

Exile
It takes your mind... again
You got sucker's luck...
Have you given up?

Does it feel like a trial?
Does it trouble your mind the way, you trouble mine.

Exile
It takes your mind... again
Exile
It takes your mind... again
Oh, you meant so much...
Have you given up?

Does it feel like a trial?
Does it trouble your mind the way, you trouble mine.

Does it feel like a trial?
Now, you're thinkin' too fast you're like, marbles on glass.

Vilify
Don't even try

You got sucker's luck...
Have you given up?

Does it feel like a trial?
Does it trouble your mind the way you trouble mine.

Does it feel like a trial?
Did you fall far for the same emptinesses again?
