Armoured cars sail the sky
They're pink at dawn
If I lived forever you just wouldn't be so beautiful
As the sun
When it shines
All over the world
We're pilots watching stars
The world pre-occupied
We're pilots watching stars
Who do we think we are?
Ice and clouds
Shimmer outside
Rain just falls
At magic hour
Itss just the sound
Of you and me
Time twitching
Murmurs of our friendly machine
