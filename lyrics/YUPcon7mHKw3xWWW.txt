Alright...

We're scanning the scene In the city tonight
We're looking for you to start up a fight
There is an evil feeling In our brains
But it's nothing new

You know it drives us insane

Running
On our way, hiding
You will be dying
A thousand deaths

Running
On our way, hiding

You will be dying
A thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and Destroy
Searching

Seek and Destroy
Searching
Seek and Destroy

Searching

Seek and Destroy
There is no escape and that's for sure
This is the end we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in

You've always been taking

And now you're giving
Running
On our way, hiding
You will be dying
A thousand deaths

Running
On our way, hiding

You will be dying
A thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and Destroy

Searching
Seek and Destroy

Searching
Seek and Destroy
Searching
Seek and Destroy

Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away
Cause you're the one we will find
Running
On our way, hiding
You will be dying
A thousand deaths
Running
On our way, hiding
You will be dying
A thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and Destroy
Searching
Seek and Destroy
Searching
Seek and Destroy
Searching
Seek and Destroy
Ah ha ha ha ha...
