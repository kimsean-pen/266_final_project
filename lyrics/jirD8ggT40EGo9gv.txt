When we were together, I held you down
I gave you all of me, but look at us now
Thinking of all your excuses, but they don't add up
Now it's so easy to see you don't deserve my love

You pushed me far... you brought me to this
You had my heart... but then you blew it
And I'm so over you, go get lost
Boy who do you think that you are

Trust and believe me, you're gonna need me
Trust and believe me, she'll never be me
And I'm so over you
Go get lost
Boy I don't know
Who do you think that you are?

You look so foolish
With my best friend
And she ain't no better than you
She's a 3, I'm a ten
So why are you calling my phone
You ain't got nothing I want
Thought we were really in love
But that was all a front

You pushed me far... you brought me to it
You had my heart... but then you blew it
And I'm so over you, go get lost
Boy who do you think that you are

Trust and believe me, you're gonna need me
Trust and believe me, she'll never be me
And I'm so over you
Go get lost
Boy I don't know
Who do you think that you are?

How dare you try to clean it up
Boy please just stop it now
Don't make a sound
Cause you

You pushed me far... you brought me to this
You had my heart... but then you blew it
And I'm so over you, go get lost
Boy who do you think that you are

Believe me, you're gonna need me
Trust and believe me, she'll never be me
And I'm so over you
Go get lost
Boy I don't know
Who do you think you are?

I'm so over you
Go get lost
Who do you think that you are?
