Some magic, some raw nerve
Surrender, and let the beat control your body
You're changed. Can't help it. Hone your edge
And let the beat control your body
Invincible. So seductive, that wildness.
And let the beat control your body
Get involved. Don't chase, allow this movement
And let the beat control your body

Some magic, some raw nerve
Surrender, and let the beat control your body
You're changed. Can't help it. Hone your edge
And let the beat control your body
Invincible. So seductive, that wildness.
And let the beat control your body
Get involved. Don't chase, allow this movement
And let the beat control your body

And let the beat control your body

Uncontrollable, inconsolable, electric, primitive
Uninvited. So excited. Savage prerogative.
Ferocious. Precocious. Raw power, ecstasy.
Liberate, don't hesitate
And let the beat control your body.

And let the beat control your body.

And let the beat control your body.

And let the beat control your body.

And let the beat control your body.

And let the beat control your body.

And let the beat control your body.

And let the beat control your body.

And let the beat control your body.

And let the beat control your body.
