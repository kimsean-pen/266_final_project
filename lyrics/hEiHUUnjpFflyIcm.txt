Cause we're hot like fire
And we're cool like rain
We can get much higher
You need to feel the same

Cause I'm chasing the first feelings you gave to me
Can't be different

Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)

Cause we're hot like fire
And we're cool like rain
We can get much higher
You need to feel the same

Cause we're hot like fire
I can't simplify

Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to

I'm feeling a fever
And it feels so good
What I gotta do to make you stay?
Oh how I wish that you had

Cause I'm chasing the first time you sounded like that
Couldn't shift conflict

Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)

Cause we're hot like fire
And we're cool like rain
We can get much higher
You need to feel the same

Cause we're hot like fire
I can't simplify

Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)

See it glow, our love in the night
See it burn, burning so bright
See the flame, only you can get burned
But you burn, we'll be burning so bright

Cause we're hot like fire
Cause we're hot like fire
Cause we're hot like fire
Cause we're hot like fire
