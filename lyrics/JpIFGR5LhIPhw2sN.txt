On Franklin & Normandy
A house 'bout eighteen deep
Kids play in bloody streets, but why?
Is dope and pro-misery a note for you and me?
You're taught to live and breathe those lines

But you don't gotta change your life
You just gotta free your mind
Ain't nobody gon' do what you do for yourself (For yourself)
You know when it's wrong or right
Even if it's black and white
Ain't nobody gon' do what you do for yourself

I know it's hard to stand what you don't understand
(You don't understand)
You wanna say it, but you can't explain it
I know it's hard to stand what you don't understand
(You don't understand)
Let's ﬁnd the ﬁre and ﬁnish what you started
(Finish what you started) Started
What you started
What you started
What you started

From 13, the change I've seen, TV's reality
It's killin' all the real inside (None of this is real)
Why raise to take the lead with shackles on your feet?
'Cause nothin' is for keeps when you die

You don't gotta change your life
You just gotta cross that line (Ooh)
Ain't nobody gon' do what you do for yourself (Do for yourself)
You know when it's wrong or right (Ooh, wrong or right)
Even if it's black and white (If it's black or white)
Ain't nobody gon' do what you do for yourself

I know it's hard to stand what you don't understand
(You don't understand)
You wanna say it, but you can't explain it
I know it's hard to stand what you don't understand
(You don't understand)
Let's ﬁnd the ﬁre and ﬁnish what you started
