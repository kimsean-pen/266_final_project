I met him when I was young
I was out with my best friend having fun
She died when she was 21
Sometimes I still think about her

When I pass him on the street
Or when I meet him in a bar
When I feel him in my dreams
Or when I wake up in the dark
It's like we're strangers
We're strangers
But he knows everything about me

We moved in with each other pretty fast
Sometimes we fought real bad
But he made me laugh almost every day
Oh, it was hard to see him walk away

When I pass him on the street
Or when I meet him in a bar
When I feel him in my dreams
Or when I wake up in the dark
It's like we're strangers
We're strangers
But he knows everything about me

Please don't tell my secrets to anyone
I will never tell your secrets to anyone
Oh, please don't tell my secrets to anyone
I will never tell your secrets to anyone

Strangers
Strangers
He knows everything about me
Oh, I know everything about him
