Avoiding my care but holding my heart
I fill them with things which all fall apart
I enlist the gods and all of the thoughts
We are hand in gloves days have chains of love

THERE'S NO PARTICULAR PLACE WE ARE GOING
Still, we are going
THERE'S NO PARTICULAR PLACE WE ARE GOING
Still, we are going

Yes, we are

I rise and shine and I look behind
Your eyes like x'es of hate and of hexes
My soul of vapor and light as a feather
And I bind together the pain, the pleasure

THERE'S NO PARTICULAR PLACE WE ARE GOING
Still, we are going
THERE'S NO PARTICULAR PLACE WE ARE GOING
Still, we are going

Yes, we are
