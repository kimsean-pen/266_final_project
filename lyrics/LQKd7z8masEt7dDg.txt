I remember every night we spent on weekends
With good friends
We did nothing but it seems like we did so much
Back then
Oh back then we would kick it laughin', all relaxin'
And taking things for granted
We did anything but just that little rush (oh yeah)

Just don't forget this
We won't regret this
We've got one chance to get it right

We're alive and we drive to the center of it
Where we know we're all fine
And this just can't be it
And in the end we all know
We only breathe for so long
So tonight's the night
We all roll along

Back to our first cigarette
And well, we can't forget all of the faces that we've met
Eighty One Twenty Three means everything to me
Take me back to the parking lots
The sleep we fought
And all the places we got caught
This place will always be a part of me
Yea, you're all a part of me

Just don't forget this
We won't regret this
We've got one chance to get it right

We're alive and we drive to the center of it
Where we know we're all fine
And this just can't be it
And in the end we all know
We only breathe for so long
So tonight's the night
We all roll along

I remember every day that I spent dreaming
Of leaving
This place behind
I would run away from thinkin'
Adding up all the days spent wasted
Chasing the girls we hated
Some things, they, they never change

Take me back to the sleepless nights
The stupid fights
And oh, it never mattered who was wrong
Or who was right
And now you're all a part of me

We're alive and we drive to the center of it
Where we know we're all fine
And this just can't be it
And in the end we all know
We only breathe for so long
So tonight's the night
We all roll along
