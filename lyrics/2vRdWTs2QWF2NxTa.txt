Somebody's gotta tell
these kids to go back home
You don't know what you're getting
yourselves into
Somebody's gotta tell
these kids what is right
Somebody's got to tell
these kids to know what's death what's life

Everyone needs the sun
Everyone needs some rain
sometimes a rain that pours
down all our shame away
a voice you can't ignore
a look you can't deny
it's been there all this time
just for you –

(Everyone needs the sun)

I'm not too good for you
You know i ain't no angel
I'm only good to you
because I know you are my maker
Can't be a fool for you
and there's no way to pay back
all that's been paid by you
just for this
soul to get its name back

Everyone needs a song
Everyone needs a story
a reason to go on
and see some hope still soaring but
no one can take your place
no one can nail you down
I want this life to be
all for you –
