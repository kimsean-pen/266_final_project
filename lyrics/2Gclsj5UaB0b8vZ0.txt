Walking a tightrope
Did you ever wanna jump?
Fall from the heavens
Because it's easier to give up?
Holding attention for too long
Just wears you down
Time to let go of everything
And leave this town

It's surreal, surreal
But don't get the needle
It's surreal, surreal
But don't get the needle

It's surreal, surreal
Keep it surreal
Surreal
Surreal
Surreal
