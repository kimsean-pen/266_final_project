Fresh cut grass, one cold beer.
Thank the Lord I am here and now, here and now.
Summer dress, favorite park.
Bless your soul, we are here and now, here and now.
I'm wide awake, so what's the point of dreaming when your life is great?
Celebrate the feeling, celebrate the feeling.
Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay.
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh.
Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay.
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh.
We're sleeping out, I believe we'll be okay.Sun kissed skin on my lips.
Thank the Lord I am here and now, here and now.
Fireflies after dark.
Bless your soul, we are here and now, here and now.
I'm wide awake, so what's the point of dreaming when your life is great?
Celebrate the feeling, celebrate the feeling.
Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay.
