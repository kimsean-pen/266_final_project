Everyone is on a different level than me
I don't think that I am at the right party
It's not like I haven't ever been here before
I've been here before
I am ready, it's time to leave it
Spent the whole night chasing a demon out (out)
Everyone has got it all together but me
I don't think that I have set the right boundaries
I can't shake the feeling that I've been here before
I've been here before

Force fed it, so forget it
I'm still coming home to you

But I wish I knew who you were, wish I knew who I was
Wish that I could speak up but I can't because I'm
So pathetic it's poetic
How did I not know?
You were just the same as I was
Wishing you could give up but you can't because

Everybody's acting like they're better than me
I feel like I've already been to this party
It's not like I haven't ever wanted to say (wanted to say)
I wanted to say
Here's what you'll get in the morning
A participation trophy
You (you), for you

Force fed it, so forget it
I'm still coming home to you

But I wish I knew who you were, wish I knew who I was
Wish that I could speak up but I can't because I'm
So pathetic it's poetic
How did I not know?
Second guessed it, I just let it
Just like me to choke
You were just the same as I was
Wishing you could give up but you can't because I'm (I'm, I'm)

Because I'm way too old (becaue I'm way too old)
To be young like this (to be young like this)
Everyone is on a different level than me
I don't think that I am at the right party
You (ooh)

But I wish I knew who you were, wish I knew who I was
Wish that I could speak up but I can't because I'm
(Yeah) So pathetic it's poetic
How did I not know?(Second-guessed)
Second guessed it, I just let it
Just like me to choke
You were just the same as I was
Wishing you could give up but you can't because
