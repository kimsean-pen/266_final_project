Everlasting lover
What do you think of me?
Am I everything you wanted?
Cause I try to be

The thing is, I don't want an ordinary life
I am not an ordinary girl
I wanna travel
I need to see the whole wide world
So I don't unravel
I don't want an ordinary life

I don't think I'm ready, for simplicity
Complicated emotions, start taking over me
I run into a stranger, or is it my friend?
I can't tell the difference
The days starting to blend

I don't want an ordinary life
I am not an ordinary girl
I wanna travel
I need to see the whole wide world
So I don't unravel
I don't want an ordinary life

I don't want an ordinary life
I'm not an ordinary girl (ordinary girl)
I wanna travel (ordinary world)
I need to see the whole wide world (ordinary girl)
So I don't unravel
I don't want an ordinary life
I don't want an ordinary life
I don't want an ordinary life
I don't want an ordinary life
