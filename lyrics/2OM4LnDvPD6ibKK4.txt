When the damn thing breaks
I'll be there to take you home
When the damn thing breaks
I'll be there to take your pulse

In the cracks of our skin
There's a memory of a dove
When the dusk dissipates
I'll grow patient like atoll

Heavy, the boulder
Resting on the blade
Swing low, sweet seesaw
Right above your ribcage
Bodies of water
I could book it dancer
Dance on the air
And then input in prayers

When the damn thing breaks
I'll be there to take you home
When the damn thing breaks
I'll be there to take you home

When the damn thing breaks
I'll be there to take you home
When the damn thing breaks
I'll be there to take you home
