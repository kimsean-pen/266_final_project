Hard bark on the family tree
October leaves on Massachusetts' trees.

A sight so fleetingly free

Just how October leaves
Just how October leaves
Just how October leaves
Me

On fire with the maple trees,
On my knees with these leaves on these Boston streets,
Praying to a god a godforsaken summer night stole
(one night), one fight, one family swallowed whole.

Some things just fall apart
Some families stand like November trees: barren and stark.
Some things just fall apart
Some memories continue breaking this cold heart

And some sons have a hard time
Looking at things the same
Looking in their father's eyes
When both their heads hang in shame

Highways home become oceans
That I just can't swim
And the rusty gates of Eden lock
To never let me in.

Let me in

Oceans of emotions we've got to swim

Well I open my eyes
I can't see that family
I can't see that home

So I'll just keep them closed

Outside the door with these open arms,
With the warmth of the maple tree.

If these trees can't replaces these scars
Then let their leaves just bury me

Let their leaves just bury me.
