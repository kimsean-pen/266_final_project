I see who you are
Behind the skin and the muscles
I see who you are now
And when you'll get older later

I will see the same girl
The same soul
Lioness, fire heart
Passionate lover

And afterwards
Later this century
When you and I have
Become corpses

Let's celebrate now
All this flesh on our bones
Let me push you
Up against me tightly
And enjoy every bit of you, love bird

Let's celebrate now
All this flesh on our bones
Let me push you
Up against me tightly

Let's celebrate now
All this flesh on our bones
And enjoy every bit of you now
I see who you are
