I was in the other room
When handsome was getting leather and laces
Couldn't save the family
'Cos heroes wear masks and lycra
Out, out, out, out, out Mary get out
You're freezing
In, in, in, in, in brother get in
Or get your head kicked in, in, in, i-in
'Cos it's in, in, in, i-in

Down, down, down, down, down I heard you fell down
And scraped your knee
Up, up, up, up, up pick yourself up
And get a plaster on, on, on your cut
'Cos it's on, on, on and up
And it's on, on, on and up
You wish that it was you
You wish that it was you

You wish that it was you

So you got yourself in a hole
You can't get out
I won't be there, I can't be around
So hold me down
I'll let you know
'bout the places we can't go
I won't let go and I won't hold you back
When I'm falling away
I've paid the price and I'm willing to pay
So willing to pay the price you pay
And the reason I can't stay
'Cos you live so far away

You wish that it was you
You wish that it was you
You wish that it was you
You wish that it was you, oh-oh
You wish that it was you, oh-oh
You wish that it was you.
So out, out, out, out Mary get out
'Cos you're freezing
And in, in, in, in brother, get in
Brother get in
Oh, brother get in
Hey, wow, hey
Brother get in
