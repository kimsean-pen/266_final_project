Baby, baby
Baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself

I've got this burning, burning
Yearning feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad

You came into my heart (baby, baby)
So tenderly
With a burning love (baby, baby)
That stings like a bee (baby, baby)
(Ooh baby, baby)

Now that I surrender (baby, baby)
So helplessly
You now wanna leave (baby, baby)
Ooh, you wanna leave me (baby, baby)
(Ooh baby, baby)

Ooh, baby, baby (baby, baby)
Where did our love go?
Ooh, don't you want me (baby, baby)
Don't you want me no more (baby, baby)
Ooh, baby (ooh baby, baby)

Baby, baby
Where did our love go
And all your promisses (baby, baby)
Of a love forever more (baby, baby)
(Ooh baby, baby)

I've got this burning, burning (baby, baby)
Yearning feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me (baby, baby)
And it hurts so bad (baby, baby)
(Ooh baby, baby)

Before you won my heart (baby, baby)
You were a perfect guy
But now that you got me (baby, baby)
You wanna leave me behind (baby, baby)
Ooh baby, baby (baby, baby)

Baby, baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me (baby, baby)
All by myself (baby, baby)
(Ooh baby, baby)
Ooh, baby, baby (baby, baby)
Where did our love go? (baby, baby)
