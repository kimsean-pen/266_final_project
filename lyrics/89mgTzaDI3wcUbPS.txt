Last night I had a dream we were inseparably entwined
Like a piece of rope made out of two pieces of vine
Held together, holding each other with no one else in mind
Like two atoms in a molecule, inseparably combined

Then I woke, from the dream to realise I was alone
A tragic event, I must admit, but let's not be overblown
I'm not trying to write a love song, just a sad pathetic moan
And maybe I just need a change, maybe I just need a new cologne

Now I look at love like being stabbed in the heart
You torture each other from day to day and then one day you part
Most of the time it's misery, but there's some joy at the start
And for that I'd say it's worth it, just use a blade that's short and sharp on me

And if love is just a game, then how come it's no fun
And if love is just a game, how come I've never won
I guess maybe it's possible, I might be playing it wrong
And that's why every time I roll the dice I always come undone
