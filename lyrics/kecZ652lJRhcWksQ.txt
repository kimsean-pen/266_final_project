Crawling out my window is such a sneaky thing
I'd like to get to know you, sit with you on a swing
I don't think much about her unless I think of spring
She left me 'cause I knew that we were only just a fling

I'm dying to hold you, but you're so far away
I cannot help that I have changed, but now I'd like to stay
Get no sleep night after night, just waiting for the day
I'll wake up in the morning and everything's okay

A summer breeze crawls in through my window
Kisses my forehead sends chills down my spine
Visitors come in your house, go on and say hello
The way her hair brushed over her face was divine
I don't wanna keep on living this way
Hanging on from day to day to day
I don't wanna keep on living this way
Hanging on from day to day to day to day

Kissing while your mom's away is such a dirty thing
Hugging while their backs are turned is such a tricky thing
Tell me that you love me, you're such a sweet young thing
And when the lights go out at night you're such a sneaky thing
