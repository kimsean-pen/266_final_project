I've figured all the years we shared were proof enough
To extend my hand and help you
i know that gettng started can be rough
If you smile, you seem grateful
I felt good about myself
That's until the day you showed me
You don't need anybody else

Why'd you have to go
And make me say these things about you
Why'd you have to turn around
After all that we've been through

I've figured all the memories are proof enough
To maybe open you eyes
From the people you think hold your trust
Do you ever smile, and find it shameful
'cause you don't know who you are
I am glad you never told me
You needed anybody else

Why'd you have to go
And make me say these things about you
Why'd you have to turn around
After all that we've been through

What will you do when there's no-one to fall back on
I won't be there, i 've learned my lesson
What will you do when there's no friends to fall back on
Because they've all been stepped on

Why'd you have to go
And make me say these things about you
Why'd you have to turn around
After all that we've been through

Why'd you have to go
Why'd you have to turn around
After all that we've been through

What will you do when there's no-one to fall back on
