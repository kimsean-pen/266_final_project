With the conviction of the woman you made me
I find
Blades of grass from the island you lent me
I find
On every floor
In every drawer
Though I'm not an island I'm a body of water
Jeweled in the evening a solitary daughter
If picked at by noon
By midnight I'm ruined

Leave me alone to the books and the radio snow
Leave me alone to the charcoal and the dancing shadow

If each blade of grass was meant here for me
Split apart, sliced, and wedged in for me
Who's gonna treat it?
I'm not going to need it

Leave me alone to the books and the radio snow
Leave me alone to the charcoal and the dancing shadow

I am a lake
Don't need to be watered
I am an ocean
I don't need to barter

I play with the moon
My only friend
It pushes it pulls me
I don't pay rent
I don't need the walls
To bury my grave
I don't need your company
To feel saved
I don't need the sunlight
My curtains don't draw
I don't need objects
To keep or to pawn
I don't want your pity
Concern or your scorn
I'm calm by my lonesome
I feel right at home
And when the wind blows
I get to dancing
My fun is the rhythm of air
When it's prancing

I play with the moon
My only friend
It pushes it pulls me
I don't pay rent
I don't need the walls
To bury my grave
I don't need your company
To feel saved
I don't need the sunlight
My curtains don't draw
I don't need objects
To keep or to pawn
I don't want your pity
Concern or your scorn
I'm calm by my lonesome
I feel right at home
And when the wind blows
I get to dancing
My fun is the rhythm of air
When it's prancing

Leave me alone to the books and the radio snow
Leave me alone to the charcoal and the dancing shadow
