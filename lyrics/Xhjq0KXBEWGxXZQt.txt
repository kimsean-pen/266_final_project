Everything in a moment starting where
Something you said is hanging in the air
Now I know my life is sweetening
Changing everything

Something that you said
Turned me from the inside out
Running through my head
Something I have dreamed about

And I feel so real
And it feels so right
(Something you said)

Showing you every weakness
And feeling strong for it
I used to run from real love
Now I long for it

Now I know what I've been missing
Since I've been listening

Something that you said
Turned me from the inside out
Lying in my bed
Whispering your name out loud

And I feel so real
And it feels so right
Something that you said
Got through to me tonight

Never so far you can't call me back
I'm never more than a single kiss away

And I feel so real
And it feels so right
(Something you said)

Something that you said
Turned me from the inside out
Running through my head
Something I have dreamed about

And I feel, and I feel
And it feels so right
(Something you said)

Something that you said
Turned me from the inside out
Lying in my bed
Whispering your name out loud
