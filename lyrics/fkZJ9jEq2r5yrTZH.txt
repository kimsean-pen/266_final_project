Coming in
Coming in
Coming in

Coming in, Coming in
Wanna disappear in a crowd
Just a stranger, in a room

Wanna change your colors just for the night
With no word of it following you, oh,
No word of it following you, oh,
No word of it following you, oh, no word of it
Oeh oeh oeh
You're just a stranger in a room
Oooeh oeh oeh
You're just a stranger in a room
Stranger in a room

Stranger in a room
Stranger in a room
Tonight I felt for the outline
Someone I wanted to know

Cause he's under the blue light
There's always someone I wanted to know
No way of it working back home
No way of it working back home
No way of it working back home
No way of it

I don't wanna waiste my time
On an unfamiliar eye
Been looking in from the outside
Are you coming in, coming in

Oeh oeh oeh
You're just a stranger in a room
Oeh oeh oeh
You're just a stranger in a room
Oeh oeh oeh
You're just a stranger in a room
Oeh oeh oeh
You're just a stranger in a room
Just a stranger in a room
Just a stranger in a room
Just a stranger in a room
Just a stranger in a room
In a room
