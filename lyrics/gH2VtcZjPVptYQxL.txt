i drove a nail in the bottom of my walking boot
so i wail every time i hit the floor
i'm dragging and i'm bleeding
i'm begging and i'm pleading
cause i thought you had another
and you cannot have another lover

i don't believe in loving with a ball and chain
cause i feel how it crippled me inside
i thought you were a cheating
i couldn't bear you leaving
now i know you didn't do it
i need you to believe me when i say

i didn't mean it
i didn't mean it
what i said
i didn't mean it
baby, i didn't mean it

so i accused you wrong
now i'm the guilty one
hey, give me my sentence
i'll pay my penance
nothing kills me more
than the pain i have for hurting you

i didn't mean it
i didn't mean it

what i said
i didn't mean it
baby, i didn't mean it
what i said
i didn't mean it
i didn't mean it
what i said
i didn't mean it
baby, i didn't mean it

hey

hooooo oooo
hooooo oooo

hey
i didn't mean it
i didn't mean it
what i said
i didn't mean it
baby, i didn't mean it
what i said
i didn't mean it
i didn't mean it
what i said
i didn't mean it
baby, i didn't mean it

hey
