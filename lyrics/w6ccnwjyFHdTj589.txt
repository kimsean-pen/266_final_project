You reeled me in with your smile
You made me melt with your voice
Now I've been gone now for awhile
Just to find that I'm your seventh choice

And I don't wanna pay the cost
But it be best if you get lost
Because, we know you'll never change

Don't say that you need me
And don't play these games with my mind
You better get out of my head
'Cause you're wasting your time

And don't say it's forever
And don't play, 'cause, you had your shot
You better stop messing around
'Cause you're gonna get caught

You'd promise me all of your time
I guess I'm not the only one
You see it's my heart on the line this time
I'm your number one or I'm gone

Don't say that you need me
And don't play these games with my mind
You better get out of my head
'Cause you're wasting your time

And don't say it's forever
And don't play, 'cause, you had your shot
You better stop messing around
'Cause you're gonna get caught

Go and try to get me back (you won't get me back, you won't get me back)
I won't forget about our past (I won't forget, no)
I never had the guts to leave
Now you're making it (you know you're making it, you're making it)
Now you're making it much easier for me to see

Don't say that you sorry
For breaking every inch of my heart
I should've known from the start, now it's time to get lost

And don't say that you need me
And don't play these games with my mind
You better get out of my head
'Cause, you're wasting your time

Don't say it's forever
And don't play, 'cause, you had you shot
You better stop messing around
'Cause, you're gonna get caught
You better stop messing around
'Cause, you're gonna get caught
