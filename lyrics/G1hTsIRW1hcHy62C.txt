Let's break this all down and we'll take a look
We'll watch you tear a page from another book
I can't imagine how you found the heart
Watch you convince them who you think you are
Let's break this all down

Keep your silver spoon
In your own mouth, feed your own self-destruction
Keep your silver spoon
To yourself instead of shoving it down my throat

Someone else's game is your claim to fame
Someone else's game
So keep your silver spoon in your own mouth

Tell me what it's like living day-to-day
Watching all your friends while they grind away
I can remember when you made a sound
Based on what you felt not on what you found

Can you feel without a body when you're a carbon copy?
It just makes no sense to me and I think we're at capacity
But don't you go crying now

Keep your silver spoon
In your own mouth, feed your own self-destruction
Keep your silver spoon
To yourself instead of shoving it down my throat

Someone else's game is your claim to fame
Someone else's game
So keep your silver spoon in your own mouth

There's something comforting about knowing who I am
Something comforting about knowing who I am

Keep your silver spoon
Keep your silver spoon
To yourself instead of shoving it down my throat

Someone else's game is your claim to fame
Someone else's game
So keep your silver spoon, keep your silver spoon

Can you feel without a body
Can you feel without a body
Can you feel without a body
Can you feel without a body
Can you feel without a body
