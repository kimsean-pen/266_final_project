deserve the rush
that lingers long enough
you do no harm
but this suddenness
sweeps in
catches my breath

"nothing's the same as anything else"

i can't confess
at least not yet
inconsolable mess

time to make eyes
longing aches fade in time
and echoes do no harm
tenses combine
odds slip
you fuzz the signs

"nothing's the same as anything else"

you don't expect
at least not yet
illegible death

"nothing's meant to be"
