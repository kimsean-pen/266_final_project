I've an awfully feeling
That this thought that's been a stealing thru my brain
Is not to be ignored
But to really tell the truth
Though I'm not a well-known sleuth
I honestly believe that you are bored
You've changed

That sparkle in your eyes is gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart
You've changed

You've changed
Your kisses now are so blase
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand
You've changed

You've forgotten the words, "I love you"
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realize you've ever cared
You've changed

You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me what we're through
It's all over now
You've changed
