Mmm, mmm, mmm, yeah
Hey!
Alright now!
Ooh!

And I got you on the back foot
And you know I got you really good
'Cause there's something deep inside of me
I got to be

And if you find it hard to follow me
If I lose you in my gift stream
Than you only got to raise your eyes
And see me fly

Don't tell me that I won't, I can
Don't tell me that I'm not, I am
Don't tell me that my master plan
Ain't coming through, yeah

Don't tell me that I won't, I will
Don't tell me how to think, I feel
Don't tell me 'cause I know what's real
What I can do

Something that you don't see every day
A little girl who found her way
Through a world that's designed to break
All of your dreams, hey

And if there's thing I will say to you
Is that there is nothing that you can't do
'Cause it's all about your attitude
Don't let them get to you

Now don't tell me that I won't, I can
Don't tell me that I'm not, I am
Don't tell me that my master plan
Ain't coming through, yeah

Don't tell me that I won't, I will
Don't tell me how to think, I feel
Don't tell me 'cause I know what's real
What I can do, oh yeah, yeah
Yeah, hey

Oooh
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Oooh
Mmm, yeah

And we're singing it out our voice
We can make that choice to be
To be free now
And we're singing it out our voice
We can make that choice to be
To be free now

Music, hey, L-U-V, I love it
Yeah, hey, hey, yeah
Music now, now, now, yeah, L-U-V, baby
I love it, yes, I do now

Don't tell me that I won't, I can
Don't tell me that I'm not, I am
Don't tell me that my master plan
Ain't coming through

Don't tell me that I won't, I will
Don't tell me how to think, I feel
Don't tell me 'cause I know what's real
What I can do

Free me, free me
Free me, free me
Free me, free me
Free me, free me

Free me, free me
Free me, free me
Free me, free me
Free me, free me
