Woke up in the rusted frame of a burned out old DeVille
Your legs are shot and they're flushed with pain
But you can't keep 'em still
The sun sets and you're afraid of that itching in your skin

You stumble down the boulevard of neon encrusted temple
You're looking for the grace of God in the arms of a fellow stranger
Disciples hand you catalogs of concubines
As you stumble down the boulevard crying "Hosanna"

Welcome to fabulous
Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas
Give us your dreamers, your harlots and your sin
Las Vegas
Didn't nobody tell you the house will always win?

Cameras on the ceiling tile, no place for you to hide
It's a hundred seven and you're looking for shade that
No palm tree can provide

But there's a little girl you remember back in Tennessee
You have this reoccurring dream
Where you see her playing hide-and-seek
With a woman who used to know you very well

Sunsets in neon lights
Call girls in neon lights
Blackjack and lady luck
Cocaine and lady luck

You call upon her on holy knees tonight in Las Vegas
Give us your dreamers,
Your harlots and your sin
Las Vegas

Didn't nobody tell you?
Didn't nobody tell you?
Didn't nobody tell you?
The house will always win.
