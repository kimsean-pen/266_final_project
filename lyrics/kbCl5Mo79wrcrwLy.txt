I took a house by the water
took a man on a mountainside
pretty house by the water
lovely lover by the waterside
last time i saw that man
he hung down his head and cried
Corrina, corrina
do you have to go
corrina, corrina
tell me why do you have to go
just made me come to love you girl
now you pack your things and go
leave me this bird that whistles
leave me this bird that sings
I got a bird that whistles
i got a bird that's singin'
if i don't have you darlin'
birds don't mean nothin'
