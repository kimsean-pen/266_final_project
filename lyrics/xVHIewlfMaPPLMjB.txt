One by one day pass me by
And I've used up my supplies
Out of water, out of hope
Can't make fire, only smoke
Here I am alone in silence
Cast away on a desert island
A traveller in ocean lost at sea

Smoke signals in the night sky
Hope you see them as you pass by
I'm screaming from the cliff top
You're the only one I've got to rescue me, to rescue me
Why can't you see? Why can't you see?
I don't think that I'll survive
I'll die here without you
Oh, I can't live without you

Sun comes up, then sun goes down
Wonder if I'll ever be found
Here I am alone in silence
Cast away on a desert island
A traveller in ocean lost at sea

Smoke signals in the night sky
Hope you see them as you pass by
I'm screaming from the cliff top
You're the only one I've got to rescue me, to rescue me
Why can't you see? Why can't you see?
I don't think that I'll survive
I'll die here without you
Oh, I can't live without you

Smoke signals in the night sky
Hope you see them as you pass by
I'm screaming from the cliff top
You're the only one I've got to rescue me, to rescue me
Why can't you see? Why can't you see?
I don't think that I'll survive
I'll die here without you
Oh, I can't live without you
