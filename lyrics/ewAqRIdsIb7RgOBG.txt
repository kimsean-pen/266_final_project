So after all that has been said
Can we find a way back to when
The days were ours to take
And nothing ever hurt
An we failed to offer or forgive

Reach out for the favors
Take down the hopeful light
For even the broken break

In the silence that only you know
What hides in the emptiness
That only you know
When the night is long
And the will is weak
Even the broken break

It is pain you will never know
Held up to a light you once shone
For every hour in my head
The mind distorts
So what can the broken ever say

Phase out the noise pollution
Tune out the insanity's dream
Take the hopeless down

In the silence only you know
What hides in the emptiness
That only you know
In that darkness
That only you know
Inside the loneliness
That only you know
When the night is long
And the will is weak
