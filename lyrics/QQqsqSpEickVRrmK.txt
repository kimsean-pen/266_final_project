When I don't want to fall asleep
I just think about everything
Can hear you in the corridor
Like it did before, but now were not in sync
Anymore, anymore, anymore

And I can feel you're slippin' out
You'll be better now, you are bound to
The animals are coming down, with a bitter sound
It doesn't hurt you and me anymore, anymore

Takes all of your patience
To deal with the neighbours
And all of your control
Is slippin' from your soul
You call when you wake up
And after the day's done
He wants you to hold him
To make him feel fine

They're running round my head again
I'll be making friends, and calling them
But living in the city now, for another hour
It doesn't wake me up anymore, anymore

Takes all of your patience
To deal with the neighbours
And all of your control
Is slippin' from your soul
You call when you wake up
And after the day's done
He wants you to hold him
To make him feel fine

Takes all of your patience
To deal with the neighbours
And all of your control
Is slippin' from your soul
You call when you wake up
And after the day's done
He wants you to hold him
To make him feel fine

When I don't want to fall asleep
I just think about everything
Can hear you in the corridor
Like it did before, but now were not in sync
Anymore, anymore, anymore
