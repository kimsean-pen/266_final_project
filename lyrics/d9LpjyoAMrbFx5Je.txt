Guess I had something to say
You tried to leave
I held myself in the way
I coulda begged
I coulda stood there for days
I coulda stood there for days
I must have been there for days

I couldn't wait
I couldn't wait until fall
I couldn't wait until I could feel nothing 'bout her at all
How'd I mean nothing?
How'd I mean nothing at all?

Sullii got off of the floor

Was it me all alone?
I'm so glad that I found you

I was the day that you left
You couldn't speak
I was the nothing you said
I couldn't sleep
I couldn't stay in this bed
How could I sleep in this bed?
Don't make me do this again

I couldn't wait
I couldn't wait until fall
I couldn't wait until I could feel nothing 'bout her at all
How'd I mean nothing?
How'd I mean nothing at all?

I never thought I'd fall but I found myself
You tried to cut me down but your friends stayed out
I figured from the top I could see where you end
I wish that you'd left
Yeah, I wish that you'd left

I never thought I'd fall but I found myself
You tried to cut me down but your friends stayed out
I figured from the top I could see where you end
I wish that you'd left
Yeah, I wish that you'd left

Was it me all alone?
In the ground that I fell for you
Didn't mean to get you wrong
(Didn't mean to get you wrong)
I'm so glad that I found you
