Don't lose your eye, man to spite your face,
Don't lose your eye, man to spite your face,
Because if people started snitchin' on ya, can't hide at no place
If you do wrong, the world gonna find you out
If you do wrong, the world gonna find you out
You know you can't do wrong and get by,
ain't no use in tryin', the dogs that doubt
If I was you, I'd play fair in anything I do
If I was you, I'd play fair in anything I do
Any time that the people find out that you're
crooked man their not goin', do nothin' in the world for you
My daddy taught me, ever since I was a child
My daddy taught me, ever since I was a child
Always treat your neighbors right, be fair with your friends like wild
