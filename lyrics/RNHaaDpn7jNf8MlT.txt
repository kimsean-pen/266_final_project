Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Mmmmm

Remember what I told you,
Your face will let you hide the pain,
You let me get to know you,
And not it's driving me insane

Oh baby we were never soldiers,
You and me could never fight for things we don't believe

And we will never never ever be the same,
Since we buried love we swore,
Would never end,
So now I'm laying down,
the flowers on the grave,
And we will never never ever be the same

Just hold me till tomorrow,
You don't have to say a thing,
Cause I know about the sorrow,
That the morning light will bring,
Baby we were getting colder,
'Cause feelings don't deceive

And we will never never ever be the same,
Since we buried love we swore,
Would never end,
So now I'm laying down,
the flowers on the grave,
And we will never never ever be the same

Oh, oh, oh

Baby, we were never soldiers,
You and me couldn't never fight,
For things we don't believe

Oooh

Baby, we were getting colder,
You and me could never lie,
'Cause feelings don't deceive, yeeeah

Since we buried love we swore,
Would never end (would never end),
So now I'm laying down,
The flowers on the grave (I'm laying down the flowers),
And we will never, never, ever be the same

And we will never, never, ever be the same
