Remember I was bagging up nicks, bagging up bricks keep blue hundreds like crip

Glock . with the beam, fuck nigga know what I mean
Bitch I be serving the fiends, I turn your lil brother to fiend
I turn your lil brother to fiend I bet I be serving the clean M.O.B all of my team

Niggas know I'm sippin' on the wok (wok, wok, wok, wok)
Niggas know I shut down your whole block
Pull up to your hood I drop the top, pull up on your bitch, she dropped the top
