Bobo's all alone now
Gonna get you somehow

I can see how you like to be loved
In the lower register
It's grown from a place above
To a lower register

Bobo intro, I'm in Sacramento looking out a window
The world is so big, this is where I lay
I don't want people to know
That they can glow
Only shit at four letters, A and O still go together
Like sperm on a hi-hat, keepin' things quiet
I could hit this thing forever

Bobo's all alone now
Gonna get you somehow
Bobo's all alone now
Gotta get him somehow

I can see how you like to be loved
In the lower register
It's grown from a place above
To a lower register

Galleris pokin' at my nest
Lookin' for cohesion
What a creature, what a lovely peter
Give me my per diem
Can you smash, smash, smash?
Funny that you ask, I just want to go all header
Like drugs in a riot, keepin' things quiet
You can be with me whenever

Bobo's all alone now
Gonna get you somehow
Bobo's all alone now
Gotta get him somehow
