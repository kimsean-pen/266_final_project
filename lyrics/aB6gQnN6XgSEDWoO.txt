On your feet, who's with me
On your feet, who's with me Right

One world, made better, aim straight, heart center, there is no compromise,
your pain your worth your sacrifice

On your feet, who's with me
On your feet, let's go

Every time I see inside you I see myself within you
let's go

(whoah, yeaheah) This is for the soldiers
(whoah, yeaheah)This is for the soldiers
(whoah, yeaheah) This is for the soldiers
all for one, let's go

On your feet, who's with me

Gut tight, hold steady, bellicose and ready, there is no compromise,
your pain your worth your sacrifice

On your feet, who's with me
On your feet, let's go

Every time I see inside you I see myself within you
let's go

(whoah, yeaheah) This is for the soldiers
(whoah, yeaheah)This is for the soldiers
(whoah, yeaheah) This is for the soldiers
one for all, we're coming

Every time I see inside you I see myself within you, don't let that fade away
Your pride inside of me, your honor inside me, respect inside of inside of me, go

(whoah, yeaheah) This is for the soldiers
(whoah, yeaheah)This is for the soldiers
(whoah, yeaheah) This is for the soldiers
our soldiers, let's go

(whoah, yeaheah) This is for the soldiers
(whoah, yeaheah)This is for the soldiers
(whoah, yeaheah) This is for the soldiers
all for one, we're coming

Every time I see inside you I see myself within you, don't let that fade away
Every time I see inside you I see myself within you, don't let that fade away
