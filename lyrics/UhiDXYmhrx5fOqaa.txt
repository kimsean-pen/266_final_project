I think we should make out
In a few hours I'm getting on a plane
There's a pretty safe bet you'll never see me again, yeah
I love your accent
I wonder what it'll sound like when you cum
Lets see if blondes or brunettes have more fun

I'm on the very top floor, room 1334
Theres a king sized bed
But we can do it on the floor
Turn your cellphone off
Leave a sign on the door that says do not disturb
And if I were you
I'd bring your girlfriend too
Two is better than one
Three is better than two
Leave a sign on the door
The whole night through
That says do not disturb
Do not disturb
Ah

Lets take our clothes off
I wanna show you my hidden tattoo
That nobody ever gets to see but you do
Oh baby lemme taste ya
Shake ya
Tie you up and break ya
Cuz' I've been alone
Left on my own
For too long
Oh damn, too long, too long, too long
I say come on now

I'm on the very top floor, room 1334
Theres a king sized bed
But we can do it on the floor
Turn your cellphone off
Leave a sign on the door that says do not disturb, yeah
And if I were you
I'd bring your girlfriend too
Two is better than one
Three is better than two
Leave a sign on the door
The whole night through
That says do not disturb
Do not disturb

Cellphone off
I put a sign on the door
I turn the lights off
I left the sign on the door
Take all your clothes off
Theres a sign on the door that says do not disturb
Do not disturb

Yeah

I'm on the very top floor, room 1334
Theres a king sized bed
We can do it on the floor
Turn your cellphone off
Leave a sign on the door that says do not disturb
And if I were you
I'd bring your girlfriend too
Two is better than one
Three is better than two
Leave a sign on the door
The whole night through
That says do not disturb
Do not disturb
Do not disturb
