Entertain me for the tenth hour in a row again
Anesthetize me with your gossip and many random antecdotes
and fill every hour with activity ear candy
drop me off at intersections in any city metropolitan

and keep me in this state
and keep me purgatorying
and send me back to sleep
this is far more than I have bargained for

Start every week with a breakneck urgent design
And end every speed day with my
briefcase representing free time
Spending my fumes my purchases become my lifeline
Please give my love to my family
I'll doubtfully be home at Christmas time

Don't disturb me in this state
please leave me purgatorying
I'll be damned if I'm to wake
This is far more than I am equipped for

I've held you up like a deity
like you're the sole owner of wings
This unrequited tunnel of vision
and I wonder why I've not been writing

Please keep me in this state
Please keep me purgatorying
I'll be damned if I'm to wake
This all is far more than I have bargained for
I'll be damned if I'm to wake
This is far more than I'm equipped for
