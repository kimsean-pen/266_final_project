Speak now old soul... Distant breathing.
Your choice soon exists... Now old soul.
A choice will soon be yours... Speak your time.

Darkness embracing our sun.
Darkness embracing our sun.
The rising smoke awakes me...

A crest for the brave falls in the fog.
A light shines from a distant land of ghosts.
They don't want you there.
They don't want me here.
Remember my name?
The machine is crumbling.

A crest for the brave. A light shines from a... Enter oblivion.

Darkness embracing.
Our sun is lifting.

The rising smoke awakens.
An all white room... Lifts me from its lights.
Nothing in focus. Curiosity is no more.
"Accept all we are given. It is all here for a reason."

A golden lever... A choice for gold or velvet.
Do I go on, or follow the robes in the smoke?
"Accept all we are given. It is all here for a reason."

One last search.
Our shallow minds embrace this dream.
One last search.
To kneel in the famine room.

One last search.
You'll soon give up on the world.
