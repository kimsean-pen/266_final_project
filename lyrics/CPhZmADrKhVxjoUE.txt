The days they go show
The nights they go fasta
It's only some time
Til we get together
I'm out on the street
I'm waiting for you
Do you hear me looking?
The method is clear
In waiting for you
I think I need a distraction
I'm not staying in
I'm searching for you
I can never find you

Go downtown put the drugs in my body
Step back up I'm the life of the party
Come back home and we'll get something started
Stay up late put some heat in my heartache
Go downtown put the drugs in my body
Step back up I'm the life of the party
Go downtown put the drugs in my body
Go downtown put the drugs in my body

The days they go show
The nights they go fasta
It's only some time
Til we get together
I'm out on the street
I'm waiting for you
Do you hear me looking?
The method is clear
In waiting for you
I think I need a distraction
I'm not staying in
I'm searching for you
I can never find you
Go downtown put the drugs in my body
Step back up I'm the life of the party
Come back home and we'll get something started
Stay up late put some heat in my heartache
Go downtown put the drugs in my body
Step back up I'm the life of the party
Go downtown put the drugs in my body
Go downtown put the drugs in my body
drugs in my body
drugs in my body
drugs in my body
drugs in my body
