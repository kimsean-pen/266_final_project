Fallen in decay
Inflowing shades
The oppressed revolt
Removed in dark spheres

Once exiled
Einthamoooo
Blessed...
In abyssia

Iria, Uthopia, come here
Believe in us and be like us
Taste the lusts and feed revenge
For those who dare exile you

Release all wrath, feel it
You're in the sixth communion
Never forget what happened
As marked you arrived

Since now
I name you under our cult

Enter the tunnel
Emit no emotion
Engaged with our hierarchy
Keep the mystic way to go

All father's treasure
The upcoming mighty contract

The sight of Therion
Incarnation
Illumination of darkness
Intuition

Angels who embraced
Attached to underworld
Proselytized in the land
They refuge

Exiled now survived
Exiled be opposed
Immigration in the Abyss
Immense to the heart
