It's only been a day
But it's like I cant go on
I just wanna say
I never meant to do you wrong
And I remember you told me, baby,
"Somethings gotta give."
If I can't be the one to hold you, baby
I don't think I could live

Now I'm so sick of being lonely
This is killing me so slowly
Don't pretend that you dont know me
'Cause thats the worst thing you could do
Now I'm singing such a sad song
These things never seem to last long
Something that I never planned on
Help me baby, I'm so sick of being lonely

Your stuff is in my house
So many things I cant ignore
Coat's still on the couch
Yeah, your photos on my freezer door
And I remember you told me, baby,
"Somethings gotta give."
If I can't be the one to hold you, baby
I don't think I could live

Now I'm so sick of being lonely
This is killing me so slowly
Don't pretend that you dont know me
That's the worst thing you could do
Now I'm singing such a sad song
These things never seem to last long
Something that I never planned on
Help me baby, I'm so sick of being lonely
...
I am so lonely
...

And I remember you told me, baby

Help me baby, I'm so sick of being lonely

I am so lonely

I am so lonely
