When people keep repeating
That you'll never fall in love
When everybody keeps retreating
But you can't seem to get enough

Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
To your heart

(Let my love open the door, ooh)
(Let my love open the door)
(Let my love open the door, ooh)
(Let my love open the door)

When everything feels all over
Everybody seems unkind
I'll give you a four-leaf clover
Take all the worry out of your mind

Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
To your heart

(Let my love open the door, ooh) To your heart
(Let my love open the door, ooh)
(Let my love open the door, ooh)
(Let my love open the door, ooh)

The only key to your heart
That can stop you from falling apart
Try today, your finest way
Come on and give me a chance to say

Let my love open the door
It's all I'm living for
Release yourself from misery
There's only one thing gonna set you free

That's my love
That's my love

Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door

When tragedy befalls you
Don't let it drag you down
Love can cure your problems
You're so lucky I'm around

Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
To your heart
