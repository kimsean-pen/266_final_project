We've had some fun
And yes we've had our ups and downs
Been down that rocky road
But here we are still around
We thought about someone else
But neither one took the bait
You thought about breakin' up
Now we know it's much too late

We are bound by all the rest
Like the same phone number
All the same friends
And the same address

Yes, it's true
I am happy to be stuck with you
Yes, it's true
Ah I'm so happy to be stuck with you
'Cause I can see
That you're happy to be stuck with me

We've had our doubts
We never took them seriously
And we've had our 'Ins and outs'
But that's the way, it's supposed to be
We thought about givin' up
But we could never stay away
Thought about breakin' up
But now we know it's much too late

And it's no great mystery
If we change our minds
Eventually
It's back to you and me

Yes, it's true
I am happy to be stuck with you
Yes, it's true
Ah I'm so happy to be stuck with you
'Cause I can see
That you're happy to be stuck with me

We are bound by all the rest
Like the same phone number
All the same friends
And the same address

Yes, it's true
I am happy to be stuck with you
Yes, it's true
Ah I'm so happy to be stuck with you
'Cause I can see
That you're happy to be stuck with me

Oh, I'm so happy to be stuck with you
I'm happy to be stuck with you
Happy to be stuck with you
