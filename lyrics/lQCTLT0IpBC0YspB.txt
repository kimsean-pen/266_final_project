Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found

Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out
What's it all about
Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel sad
Sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel sad
Sad
I guess I just w-(asn't)
I guess I just w-(asn't)
I guess I just wasn't made for these ti-i-i-ime
I guess I just wasn't made for these ti-i-i-ime

Wasn't, wasn't, wasn't, wasn't
Wasn't, wasn't, wasn't, wasn't
