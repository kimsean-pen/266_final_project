Some TV tonight
You don't say I don't stand too close
Because I never learned how to act right.
You'll go looking for an excuse
To feel sad or confused
When all you want to do is let them all feel abuse.
You take a letter, take an I, take an S
From a stupid sentence and I'm not impressed.
You take a person that's so well dressed
And I will feel violent because I feel violent all the time inside of me.
