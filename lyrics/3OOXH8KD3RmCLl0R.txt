Saturday night I was downtown
Working for the FBI
Sitting in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high

Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman singing a song

A pair of 45s made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9", beautiful, tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all

I saw her heading to the table
Well, a tall walking big black cat
And Charlie said, "I hope that you're able, boy
'Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at"

Well, suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
A-jumping under doors and tables
Well, I heard somebody shooting a gun

Well, the DA was pumping my left hand
And she was holding my right
Well, I told her, "Don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared"
I gotta be forgiven if I wanna spend my living

With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9", beautiful, tall
Yeah, with just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all

Had it all
Had it all
Had it all
Had it all
Had it all
Ooh, had it all
She had it all
She had it all
