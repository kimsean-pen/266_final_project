No, not again
oh, what a man
just who I thought that I wanted to have
Oh, don't do that
don't use that bat
that's all it takes to make me falling flat

No, not again
a loser I am

I love you tonight
you are my knight
cure and assure and make me feel alright
tomorrow you'll find
I'm not around
but don't be uptight
'cause I loved you last night

Vacant and free
yeah, that is me
Just tell me how and I'll please you for free
tell me I'm good
I know I'm bad
Lies make me feel fine although it is sad

Oh, not again
not one more man
