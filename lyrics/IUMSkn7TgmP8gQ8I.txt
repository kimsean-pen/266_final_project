I'm feeling like I'm high enough now
And you love what I love but it just ain't enough now
And I don't deserve you

And it all comes to how we lost you. I think we'll meet again
(just say yes, just say yes)
And I don't deserve you
And it all comes down without you. I think we'll meet again
(just say yes, just say yes)

Watching you die a little, watching you cry
(cry, cry, cry, cry, cry) a lot
This is my apology, I'm feeling lean
You know you matter so much to me

And I don't deserve you

Only in the forests [?] I feel it worse inside

But I'm stuck set and saying we can try it again
You've got your hurt in your hands. I am giving in
You want to talk... and I'm giving up
But I'm stuck set and saying we can try it again (I don't mind where you're going)
You've got your hurt in your hands. I am giving in (the remedy, remedy's the same)

I don't mind, now you know me
The remedy, remedy's the same

Don't you worry mama, your boy is a goner
Don't you worry mama, your boy is a goner

And I don't deserve you

Hey young lonely, hey young lonely
Is it all okay? (you'll find out you are strong)
And I don't deserve you
Hey young lonely, hey young lonely
Is it all okay? (you'll find out you are strong)
And I don't deserve you
It all comes down without you
This is the last night in my body
And I don't deserve you
It all comes to how we lost you (and I don't deserve you)
It all comes down without you. (and I don't deserve you)
I don't mind where you're going
The remedy, remedy's the same...
