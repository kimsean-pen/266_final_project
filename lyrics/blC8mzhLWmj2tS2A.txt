I'm not too good at living
I always dirty myself up after a vow to be clean
And I'm all too good at sinking
When my arms get tired
When my arms get tired
Turning the lights off
When nobody's home
I'm giving you piece of mind
To make you feel sure
I'm no good at making vows
I'm not too good at living
I always dirty myself up after a vow to be clean
And I'm all too good at sinking
When my arms get tired
When my arms get tired
Keeping good company
I'm always alone, but I let you inside of me
To remind me how bitter I am
I'm no good at making space
I'm not too good at living
I always dirty myself up after a vow to be clean
And I'm all too good at sinking
When my arms get tired
When my arms get tired
When my arms get tired
I'm not too good at living
I always dirty myself up after a vow to be clean
I'm all too good at sinking
When my arms get tired
When my arms get tired
