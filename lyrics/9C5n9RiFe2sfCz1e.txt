I've got my own brand of patriotism.
It comes with nights of emptiness, where I show my true colors.
The real meaning of independence.
I'm hanging this flag as a warning for you to keep your range.
It'll be better if you keep your distance.
It'll be better if you just keep away.
I am marching to the beat of a dead horse.
