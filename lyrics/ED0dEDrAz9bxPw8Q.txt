Eddie, you should know better
Brother, you know you're wrong
Think of the tears and fears
You bring to your folks back home
They'd say, where did he go wrong, my Lord?
We planned and worked hard from the very start
Tried to make him better than all the rest
But the brother proved to be so much less
Eddie is everybody's friend
But sometimes you wonder now and then
The only time he'll choose you
When there's something to lose through
His personal loss
And the friend pays the cost all the time
Must be something that's freezin' his mind
That has made him, through greed so very blind
And I don't think he's gonna make it this time
