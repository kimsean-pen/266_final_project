Well I don't know who you are
And I don't care where you've been
Please just take this deadbeat soul
Let him keep the hearts he stole
And all those little lies
They told ya in disguise
They got you through those lonely hours
Made you think the world was ours

I'm the man who shot the moon and cried
Let those thieves and bastards all collide
Take these words and burn them if you don't mind

Oh sweetheart these nights were made for me
Still so far from where I long to be
You said it from the start
Rock 'n' roll will break your heart

There's a holy roller sign
And a chance he won't be mine
There's no teenage dreams to fill
Break my heart I know he will
And we'll tumble down the street
Sleep alone in my back seat
Oh all that jealous talk we made
Strung out in the soul parade

I'm the man who shot the moon and cried
Let those thieves and bastards all collide
Take these words and burn them if you don't mind

Oh sweetheart these nights were made for me
Still so far from where I long to be
You said it from the start
Rock 'n' roll will break your heart

I'm the man who shot the moon and cried
Let those thieves and bastards all collide
Take these words and burn them if you don't mind

Oh sweetheart these nights were made for me
Still so far from where I long to be
You said it from the start
Rock 'n' roll will break your heart

Oh
Oh

You said it from the start
Rock 'n' roll will break your heart

You said it from the start
Rock 'n' roll will break your heart
