You waste your life making film
Through the frames
You revealed
The screen goes down
The tape runs out
Or the machine ceases
To operate
She'll team up
With our parade

We watch all the tapes push pause
And wave over and over at the screen
The frames go down
The tape runs out

Or the machine ceases
To operate
She'll team up
With our parade

We watch all the tapes push pause
And wave over and over at the screen
The frames go down
The tape runs out
Or the machine ceases
To operate
She'll team up
With our parade
