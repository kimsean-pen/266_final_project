Go, be yourself on your way
And don't ever look back to check if I'm okay
And don't ever be sad that you chose him instead
'Cause I don't want regrets and I'd rather be rid of it
And when you want someone who'll care
Who will know how you feel when you don't wanna share
Who will show you support when you've lost your meaning
Just remember this time when you chose not to be with me

And I tried to defend how I thought we would play out
I came and confess that I love you more than he does
So choose me instead, oh choose me instead 'cause

He is not good enough for you
He is not good enough for you
He won't do the things that I would do
He's not good enough for you
He is not good enough to be
Even half the man that he should be
And I watched you choose him instead of me
I watched you choose him instead of me

Go, be in love, I don't care
But don't ever pretend that we're both unaware
'Cause the truth is that you still permit me to be
Close enough, that I know that you don't want me to leave
And then I remember he's there
And he's been there for years at your side like a stain
And when I see you with him, in your eyes there's a pain
And it's trapped you inside like you can't get away

And I tried to defend how I thought we would play out
I came and confess that I love you more than he does
Choose me instead, woah choose me instead

He is not good enough for you
He is not good enough for you
He won't do the things that I would do
He's not good enough for you
He is not good enough to be
Even half as good as he should be
And I watched you choose him instead of me
I watched you choose him instead of me

He's not good enough for you
He's not good enough for you
He's not good enough for you
He's not good enough for you

And I tried to defend how I thought we would play out
I came and confess that I love you more than he does
Choose me instead, he's not good enough for you

He's not good enough for you, no
He's not good enough for you
He won't do the things that I would do, no
He's not good enough for you
He is not good enough to be
Even half the man that he should be
'Cause I watched you choose him instead of me
I watched you choose him instead of me
