All work and no play
Makes Dick a dull, dull boy, career gets in the way
Square jaw, ooh-ooh, such a handsome face
Why do you have to save the human race

Life of crime, no it never pays
Clean up the streets and make your secret get-away
All alone, in your room with your radio
No one to hold, you had to let her go

You're a man with a gun in your hand
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore
If you don't take time, it's not nice
So here's my advice
Take your love on the run, (on the run)
Oh God, let me be the one, (be the one)
And I don't mean with a gun

All boss and no brain
Bullies and thugs, they take up all your time in vain
Can't let go, someone cries and you hear the call
Who's gonna catch you, don't good guys (don't good guys) ever fall

You're a man with a gun in your hand
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore
If you don't take time, it's not nice
So here's my advice
Take your love on the run (on the run)
Oh God, let me be the one (be the one)
And I don't mean with a gun
'Cause I can show you some fun
And I don't mean with a gun.

All alone, in your room with your radio
No one to hold you, I would never let (never let) you go

You're a man with a gun in your hand
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore
If you don't take time, it's not nice
So here's my advice
Take your love on the run (on the run)
Oh God, let me be the one (be the one)
'Cause I can show you some fun (some fun)
And I don't mean with a gun, no

(You are a man) Oh with a gun in your hand
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore
If you don't make time, it's not nice
So here's my advice
Take your love on the run (on the run)
Oh God, let me be the one (be the one)
And I don't mean with a gun
Take it out of your hand
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore
If you don't make time, it's not nice
So here's my advice
Take your love on the run (on the run)
Oh God, let me be the one (be the one)
I can show you some fun
Gimme that gun
