The day has been melting away
We've been lying on the shore for a while
And the sun is still
And you are the sea as it glides

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
You ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooooh
You're the sea as it glides

In the kingdom of twilight
In spirit in life
He carries across me on the [?]
And the stars are [well?] where they are
For those who belong to them

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Yet I [carried backward inns?] where I go
And if not I may've run forever
Leaving fire in my way
Leaving fire in my way

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
You ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
You're the sea as it glides
