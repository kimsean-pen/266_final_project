What is it that you want to be?
I gotta go
Its in a million pieces
I gotta show you
What is it that you want to see?
I gotta know
And I'm nothing without you
What is it that you want to see?
I gotta go
Its in a trillion pieces
I gotta show you
What is it that you want to be?
I gotta go
And I'm dying without you
You only want me
When I'm gone
You only want me when I'm
Fever dreaming
What is it that you want to be?
I gotta go
Its in a million pieces
I gotta show you
What is it that you want to see?
I gotta know
And I'm dying without you
You only want me
When I'm gone
You only want me when I'm
Fever dreaming
