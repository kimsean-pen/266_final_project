To you
I'm all I've left undone
I'm all I haven't won
Lift me up my soul's so hollow
Lift me up

You take
The breath you didn't make
What's left you did forsake
Lift me up my soul's so hollow
Lift me up my soul's so hollow

You can make me scream internally
You can make me breathe eternally
Yeah

You see
The things I cannot change
The things that make me plain
Lift me up my soul's so hollow
Lift me up

We've made
All from the sum of none
All that we have become
Lift me up my soul's so hollow
Lift me up my soul's so hollow

You can make me scream internally
You can make me breathe eternally

You can make me scream internally
You can make me breathe eternally
Yeah

Feel
Feel, feel what's in me
Feel, feel what's in you
Feel, feel what's in me

So my soul's not left so hollow
You can make me SCREAM

You can make me BREATHE
You can make me scream internally
You can make me breathe eternally
You can make me scream
You can make me breathe
You can make me scream
You can make me breathe
You can make me scream
You can make me breathe, me breathe
