This is your complications calling
Your mistake, your mystery
Your broken heart

No, this is not a dream
This is really happening
I see you
And I see you

And this is some kind of truth
A kind of lie
Together we can fly
And I see you

I see you
Ah, I see you
I see you
I see you
Ah, I see you

No, this is not a dream
This is really happening
I see you
And I see you
Let this music be a kind of paradise
A kind of nightmare
A kind of "I don't care"
I see you
Oh, I see you
Yeah, I see you
Oh, I see you
