we're the cool teens
we look good in id magazine
desperately tryna make life more exciting
u got the come out nows and the too shy gals
the prom queens and the foreign penpals
so dad don't tell me what to do
i promise one day i'll make it up to you
and when mum asks where u been
i say please leave me alone i'm 17

i want someone i can call at 2am
when i've got that restless feeling again
just wanna jump the gates of a closed park
drink beer all night and have a laugh
i wanna have a cute chick on my arm
make the boys swoon and the girls all gasp
and when my mum asks where we met
i'll say it's just this girl that i met on the internet

la la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la
la la la la la
la la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la
la la la la la
she's just this girl that i met on the internet

i feel all aggy and i wanna waste time
tryna fight the feelin that i wanna run and hide
i know schools a bore
life feels like a chore
scared that ya boring
coz u saw snapchats of u snoring
but crying doesn't help your problems
and bunking the bus or train won't solve em
i spend my whole life putting up with people's shit because i need them
i love you but i'm seething
i'm grieving
heaving
it's easier to be cool if ur hot
wear too much make up and be called a thot
posing with surgical masks
polaroid cameras and giving ourselves tasks
go grab that girls ass
crush it up and call it art
be polite don't burp or fart
i'm just a desperate bitch
a snitch with a cute chick itch

i want someone i can call at 2am
when i've got that restless feeling again
just wanna jump the gates of a closed park
drink beer all night and have a laugh
i wanna have a cute chick on my arm
make the boys swoon and the girls all gasp
and when my mum asks where we met
i'll say it's just this girl that i met on the internet

la la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la
la la la la la
she's just this girl that i met on the internet

it'll happen like it does in the shows
i'll like her eyes and she'll like my clothes
ask her for her digits and i'll start to sweat
she'll become the girl that i met on the internet
i bet she'll be a spice
forget butterflies she'll give me bee hives
that couple in the corner
i ought to warn her
she's gonna be the girl that i met on the internet
