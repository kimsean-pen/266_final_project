i hope you get your invitation
it is here for you
listen to the conversation
playing pretty tunes
sorry i can't wait for you
i couldn't stand to stay
you have to get right out of here
you have to get away
i had to pay the doorman
just to let me use the door
i had to use a muscleman
to pick me off the floor
they're making up things
that we've all heard before
like romance and engage and divorce
you have to be crazy to stay in this place
you just have to laugh at it all
i met this girl and called her ma
i called her everything
i called her fab and mrs. fish
i didn't get her name
she's making me a pair of shoes
so i can run away
she's making me a plastic wig
she's making me again
i had to pay the doorman
just to let me use the door
i had to use a muscleman
to pick me off the floor
they're making up things
that we've all heard before
like romance and engage and divorce
you have to be crazy to stay in this place
you just have to laugh at it all
some people are dancing
and some fall in love
to the music of military tunes
you have to be crazy to stay in this place
you just have to laugh at it all
i didn't want to put you on
or tape you down at all
or leave you here so all alone
or put you in this room
they're making up things
that we've all heard before
like romance and engage and divorce
you have to be crazy to stay in this place
you just have to laugh at it all
