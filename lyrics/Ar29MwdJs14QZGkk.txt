Lovin' is a wild thing
And if you stand in my way
I'm gonna bully bully baby
Bully till I'm free.

The apple is shining
Like glass on a highway.
Devotion is salt in
Salt in any wound of my say

I got a bloodhound tooth
Hanging like a dagger in a bar back west
If you try and pull it down
You know I'll save all my best

Shots for you
Boom, boom, boom
Shots for you
Boom, boom, boom

Trouble is my heart twin
I shovel as I sing sing
I'm gonna dig it till I cut through
Heaving on the whole thing

The moon is mindless
But it's pulling is timeless
I'm gonna bully bully like this
Hike this until my path is windless

I'm a bad man, let me through
I'm a bad man, let me through
I'm a bad man, let me through
I'm a bad man, let me through

I got a bloodhound tooth
Hanging like a dagger in a bar back west
If you try and pull it down
You know I'll save all my best

Shots for you
Boom, boom, boom
Shots for you
Boom, boom, boom

Ooh, no one knows better than
Ooh, than the wrecker and the wrecked man
Ooh, don't need no protector
I'm a bad man, let me through

I'm a bad man, let me through
I'm a bad man, let me through
I'm a bad man, let me through
I'm a bad man, let me through, ow

I got a bloodhound tooth
Hanging like a dagger in a bar back west
If you try and pull it down
You know I'll save all my best

Shots for you
Boom, boom, boom
Shots for you you you
Boom, boom, boom

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
