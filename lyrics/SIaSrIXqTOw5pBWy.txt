master, i praise you
ive come here to tame
the demands of the flesh
ive come to forget my name
we all thought that the moon
should be turned to blood
and that its the worst thing
to want for one who comes not
but theres nothing left than to obey
all of their laws of wealth
always fighting on both sides
no denial, no denial
master, i serve you
and i serve the language
of failure and doubt
ive come to sell you my anguish
we all thought that the moon
should be turned to blood

and that its the worst thing
to try to please and please not
but theres nothing left than to obey
all of their laws of wealth
always fighting on both sides
no denial, no denial
yes, theres nothing left than to obey
all of their laws of wealth
master, are you taking sides?
no denial, no denial
and it feels like spring again
weve sealed this feel again
though you tried to blind me
i still saw you blush
it feels like spring again
weve sealed this feel again

though you tried to blind me
though you tried to blind me
we do not pause, we do not rest
so do not speak, please do not test
my nerve like this, in a season like this
we do not pause, we do not rest
so do not speak, please do not test
my nerve like this, in a season like this

you tried to blind me

you tried to blind me...
