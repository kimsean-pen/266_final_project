Let's take a walk together
Near the ocean shore
Hand in hand, you and I
Let's cherish every moment
We have been given
The time is passing by

I often pray
Before I lay down
By your side
If you receive your calling
Before I awake
Could I make it through the night

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live (whoa)
Cherish the love
Cherish the life
(Cherish the live) Cherish the love
Cherish the love we have (whoa, yes)
For as long as we both shall live
Cherish the love (baby)
Cherish the life
Cherish the love

The world is always changing
Nothing stays the same
But love will stand the test of time
The next life that we live in remains to be seen
Will you be by my side

I often pray
Before I lay down
By your side
And if you receive your calling
Before I awake
Could I make it through the night

Cherish the love we have (oh ya)
We should cherish the life we live (baby, ya)
Cherish the love (hm-mm)
Cherish the life (oh ya)
Cherish the love (oh)
Cherish the love we have
(As long as we are together)
For as long as we both shall live (in love)
Cherish the love (ah)
Cherish the life (mm)
Cherish the love
Cherish the love
Cherish the life

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love
Cherish the life
Cherish the love
Cherish the love we have
(every night that I think about you)
For as long as we both shall live
(our dreams, our dreams will come true)
Cherish the love (oh)
Cherish the life (yes I do)
Cherish the love (oh, miss your love)
Cherish the love we had
(cherish every moment that we have together)
(hand in hand, you and I)

Cherish the love
Cherish the life
Cherish the love
Cherish the love we have
For as long as we both shall live
