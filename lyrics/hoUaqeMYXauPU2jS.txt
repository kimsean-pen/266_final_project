give me one last dance
while i still stand
give me one last chance
to build my house upon the sand
give me one last hope of holding water in my hands
give me one last chance
and i'll be your man

oh i'll be your man
oh i'll be your man
oh i'll be your man
ohhh

show me one shining star i'll show you the sky
bring all your old scars and i'll kiss them goodbye
will you show me where to start will you show me where to stand
oh for one last time give me your heart
and i'll be your man

oh i'll be your man
oh i'll be your man
oh i'll be your man
ohhh

cos i never compromised
my whole life now i realise
that its time to make a change
or i'll end up feeling strange
in the dying of my days
when that old shallow grave is calling me

so i'll be your man
oh i'll be your man
oh i'll be your man
ohhh
