Even in death i'm yours
I'm a ghost
Haunting you
Every time you dance with her, I bust out of my grave
In the mood to misbehave
Haunting you
When i was alive, you know I could dance better than her
Say you do

Watching you dance drives me insane
Feel like i am dying again, again and again

Can't move on I can't go back, like i'm stuck in a trance
Do you want another chance?
Say you do
Honey, the grooviest disco queen
You've never seen
Haunting you

Watching you dance drives me insane
Feel like I am dying again, again and again

Even in death i'm yours
I'm a ghost
I'm haunting you

Watching you dance drives me insane
Feel like i am dying again
Watching you dance drives me insane
Feel like i am dying again, again and again
