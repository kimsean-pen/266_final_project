This thing called "Life" goes by so quickly
One day you're here and then you're gone
This is the moment I've lived my whole life for
And I'll never give up; I've waited too long

I've waited
Waited too long
I've waited too long

And all along the road
All the bodies left behind
May all have been good friends
Just not good friends of mine

I've been kicked out and said I quit
Then I said, "I had enough" and "This is it"
All I wanted was just one more show for the road
'Cause it was over last time before I could blink
I could blink

I've waited
Waited too long
I've waited too long

And all along the road
All the bodies left behind
May all have been good friends
Just not good friends of mine
Their bodies left behind
