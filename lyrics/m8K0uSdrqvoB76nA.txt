Well you woke me up early now and you drew me up bad
And you should be coming home this year, got me real glad
Well I start to discover oceans, started to last
And the beast came upon me, I guess it wasn't so bad

I said as you took in claws, you've slipped up under my skin
This part, it all adds upon me, I'm gonna put em back in
We've been playing like children,
Hiding out, we're playing like them
This part, it all adds upon me, I'm gonna put em back in

She took the peak of a latent heart, she laid it out just for show
She sprung around the table, unclear, I thought you should know
I saw the streets were enlightened and out the window to the road
And the beast came upon me, honey I thought you should know

Ancient eyes were upon me, I'll be working out here and planned
She laid her claws all upon me and she found me a glass
I know I'll be up early, I mean you drew me up bad
And the beast came upon me, I guess it wasn't so bad
