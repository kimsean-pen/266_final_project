These are your secrets
Hidden inside
Wherever you go
Wherever you hide

Nobody knows

Circles and circles
Places to drown
All that you feel
Is you're going down

Everyone's wondering where you are

Circles and circles
Holding you down
All that you see
Is you're not around

Somebody knows
How this feels

No one comes near
No one can tell you
What you won't hear
