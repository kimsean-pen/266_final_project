Global fear takes us to another land
It throws us one by one, one by one
Global fear moves us in an aerocraft
And counts us one by one, one by one

Breathing is impossible
I think I'm about to
Pass out, pass out

Global fear, take us to another land
Unload us one by one, one by one
Global fear, handle us with care
We're fragile, all of us, all of us

Breathing is impossible
I think I'm about to
Pass out
