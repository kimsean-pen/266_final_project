Home is where I found you
When you were scared and cold
Your wounded heart wide open
It made me feel so strong
He's sound asleep
And your trust betrayed
I promised to gods
To take you away
I saw the birches turn upside down
I saw your mouth grasping for a breath
I saw your eyes glazing in denial
I saw your body half-burned on the ground
The fog dispersed so I could watch my crime
After I crawled away like a wounded worm
My idle hands did not reach for yours
They slowly wrapped around my own head
Just one moment.
One night too dark.
One soul broken for years to come.
No call. no letter. no note. no word.
Just an empty bed, as if you were never there.
For all the times I left you on your own
For being the only one to share your grief
