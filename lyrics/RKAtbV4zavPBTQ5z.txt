Sometimes when the sun sets I feel alone
Sometimes I feel at home
This time, tonight, I need someone
And it's not the sand in my hair
It's the thoughts running through my head
All those things you never said

I'm on the last train home
And you call my phone
To say I love you is too strong
But you are all I want

When the sight of the ocean isn't enough
And the pressure on your lungs is just too much
Think of what you've got
And it's not the salt on your skin
It's me, I'm tired of running
You jump in but I won't swim
And I can't save you

I'm on the last train home
And you call my phone
To say I love you is too strong
But you are all I want
Yeah, you are all I want

And if you see me after
Is the risk I'm taking
A second class lover
In the making

If you see me after
Is the risk I'm taking
A second class lover
In the, in the

I'm on the last train home
And you call my phone
To say I love you is too strong
But you are all I want
Yeah, you are all I
Yeah, you are all i
