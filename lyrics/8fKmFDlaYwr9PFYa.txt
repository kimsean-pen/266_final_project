I will follow the sound of the owl
bless this house
bless my pillow
bless your pillow
desire
where you want to be
lovingly
you'll have to send a strong goddamn wind to get rid of me
you'll have to send a strong goddamn wind to get rid of me
every single piece
sandpaper and gum
leaning and propped
our arch undone
desire
where you want to be
lovingly
you'll have to send a strong goddamn wind to get rid of me
every single piece
my long way the wrong way
