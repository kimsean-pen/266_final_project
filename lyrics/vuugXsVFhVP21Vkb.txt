Our fire burns with thousand lights
You have no chance to stop
We came to fuck this place up

Hangout with us tonight
Cause we all suffer inside
Suffer inside
Suffer inside

This feelings we can't hide
Suffer inside
Suffer inside

We see it in your eyes
Our fire burns with thousand lights
You have no chance to stop
We came to fuck this place up
