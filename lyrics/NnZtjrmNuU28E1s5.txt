Shake it out, shake it out
God, I need another and another and another and another
I could feel it now
How I felt the Lord in my father's house

And I can see, I can see
Standing, we were seventeen, make it clean
Are you the living ghost of what I need?
Are you getting the best of me?
We will see

'Cause I'm done being done with a funeral
At least for now
Are you tired of being alone?
Are you tired of being alone?

Shake it out, shake it out
Tired of another and another wasn't really what I wanted
So we bled it out
Over the floor of my neighbor's house

And I could see, I could see
God, I've never seen a thing so complete
I am the living ghost of what you need
I am everything eternally
God, just speak

'Cause I'm done being done with a funeral
At least for now
Are you tired of being alone?
Are you tired of being alone?

So speak to me

Oh God, you got to shake it out, shake it out
You got to take it out, take it down
I've go to come around
I need it now more than I ever have

Oh God, you've got to shake it out, shake it out
You've got to break it down, break it out
You've got to come around
I feel it now more than I ever have

I felt the lord begin
To peel off all my skin
And I felt the weight within
Reveal a bigger mess
That you can't fix

I swear, I swear I'll go
Lead me into my home
Don't stop, don't ever go
I swear you'll never know
You'll never know

Oh god, you got to shake it out, shake it out
You've got to break it down, break it out
