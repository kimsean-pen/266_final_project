Happy hurts sometimes, oh
Blame it on the monsters in my mind, oh
I've been getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
What's wrong with me when happy hurts?
Happy hurts

This on again off again tempomental affection
For my darling depression is making me go mad
I hear there's a fine line between crazy and sad
But I can't tell the difference up close
There's a lot of us you know ill and undiagnosed
But I don't need a piece of paper to tell me what I already know
I'm not alright for tonight, can we let that be alright?
Pick up the battle again in the morning light

And I'm fighting so hard to come out of the dark
Trying to turn off the night
Finally let in the light
Trying to make my misery just a piece of my history
A little less victim, a little more victory

Happy hurts sometimes, oh
Blame it on the monsters in my mind, oh
I keep getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
What's wrong with me when happy hurts?
Happy hurts

So today I feel OK
Guess it was all just in my head
I just needed to try harder I guess...
Yeah everyone else in the world seems to be doing alright
Yeah, I'm alright for tonight
Can we let the pain and the happy mix
Can the two coexist?
The beauty next to the mess
Because I swear I have them both already beating in my chest
If that makes me crazy the numbers don't lie But I don't call that crazy I call it being alive.

And I'm fighting so hard to come out of the dark
Trying to turn of the night
Finally letting the light
Trying to make my misery just a piece of my history
A little less victim, please...

Happy hurts sometimes, oh
Blame it on the monsters in my mind, oh
I keep getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
What's wrong with me when happy hurts?
Happy hurts

If I had to pick between the way that I am
And the way that everybody else seems to pretend
I wouldn't consider it not for even a second between psycho and sanity
It's not even a question
My favorite parts of myself seem to make the least sense
All the cracks in my skin they just let the light in
My favorite parts of myself make the least sense
All the cracks in my skin let the light in

Happy hurts sometimes, oh
All I want's the one thing I can't find
I keep getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
What's wrong with me when happy hurts?

What's wrong with me when happy hurts?

I keep getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
What's wrong with me when happy hurts?
Happy hurts
