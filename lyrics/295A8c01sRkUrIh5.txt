Avoid eye contact, you want it, I know it's a fact
Yeah, you want that snatch but I am moving too fast
Every morning violet sky breaks up the ice
Living on them lies, my perfect paradise
I smoke it, I snort it, I roll it, I love it
I buy it, I pop it, I want it, I love it
I'm spun
hit me up, light me up, then we can go for the crime
I'm spun
candy eyes in the night, babe, you might like my vibe
I'm spun
put a line on the time tracks, you stay on my grind
So spun, so spun, so spun
I got company, borderline disorder, that's me
Manic energy, can't you see I'm living the dream
Every morning violet sky breaks up the ice
Living on em' lies, my perfect paradise
I'm spun
hit me up, light me up, then we can go for the crime
I'm spun
candy eyes in the night, babe, you might like my vibe
I'm spun
put a line on the time tracks, you stay on my grind
So spun, so spun, so spun
I'm spun
I'm spun
So spun, so spun, so spun
I smoke it, I snort it, I roll it, I love it
I buy it, I pop it, I want it, I love it
I smoke it, I snort it, I roll it, I love it
I buy it, I pop it, I want it, I love it
I'm spun
hit me up, light me up, then we can go for the crime
I'm spun
candy eyes in the night, babe, you might like my vibe
I'm spun
put a line on the time tracks, you stay on my grind
So spun, so spun, so spun
I'm spun
I'm spun
I'm spun
So spun, so spun, so spun
