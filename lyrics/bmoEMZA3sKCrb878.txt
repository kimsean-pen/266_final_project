Well I been thinking about
Things I can't say
'Cause everybody freaks out every single day
And if they weren't so stupid
They'd open their eyes
And d-d-d-d-drugs well saved my life
And I walk up in this bitch
Like I own the place
'Cause everybody is rich In the United States
There's a bunch a white people calling, why people why?
Yeah I don't think you can say that, that ain't right
But of course the government's gonna fuckin lie

Well of course the government's gonna fuckin lie
Bunch of white people calling, white people why?
And why the hell is everybody on their phone?
Why is the answer to life on the fuckin phone?
And is the answer to my happiness in the cloud?
And if I die will anyone notice if I'm not around?
And if I'm not gonna make it then I'm gonna have to kill
Aw shit man was that too fuckin' real?

Was that too fuckin real?
Was that too fuckin real?
Was that too fuckin real?
Was that too fuckin real?

Well I know you like me better
When I was reserved
When I was just like you
And I was part of the herd
I don't need another reason to decide
G-g-g-get the hell out of my life
And I'm sick of being in this stupid place
I'm sick of being a part of someone's database
And all the bullshit bends that are on the charts
Yeah motherfuckers you know who you are

Let's pretend that EDM didn't happen at all
And the politics are why you drink alcohol
And you can blame it on the left
Or you can blame it on the right
No just admit you just like to fight
No you just like to fight
No you just like to fight
You've gone so far to the left you ended up on the right
You've gone so far to the right
You don't care if you're right
Are you really feeling guilty about being white?
Hey, what's that like?

Was that too fucking real?
Was that too fucking real?
Was that too fucking real?
Was that too fucking real?
