Burning bright the mighty white began the fight
Stealing voicemail in the night keep to the right
On what brings [?] they aspire
What the hand [?] seize the fire

And this, this cold blood is thicker than wine or water
More or less it [?] it should speak much louder now
Just clap, stand, watch the flickering candle
And a mirror angled to deflect a scandal

So when the stars threw down their spears
And watered heaven with their tears
Did you smile your right to [?]
Did he who made the lamb make thee?
Did he who made the lamb make thee?
Did he who made the lamb make thee?

And for all they rise, we fall, a dirty brawl
Locked in stocks by the townhall, hang from the wall
What the hammer
What the chain
[?] what furnace
What's their grain?

And this, this [?]
[?] our sons and daughters
Rising edge, a blade that brings us all to sort of
Stop, clap, stand, listen to the sages
It's the middle ages
But with lesser wages

So when the stars threw down their spears
And watered heaven with their tears
Did you smile your right to sea
Did he who made the lamb make thee?
Did he who made the lamb make thee?
Did he who made the lamb make thee?

Did he who made the lamb make thee?
Did he who made the lamb make thee?
Did he who made the lamb make thee?

Did he who made the lamb make thee?
Did he who made the lamb make thee?
Did he who made the lamb make thee?

Did he who made the lamb make thee?
Did he who made the lamb make thee?
Did he who made the lamb make thee?

Did he who made the lamb make thee?
Did he who made the lamb make thee?
Did he who made the lamb make thee?
