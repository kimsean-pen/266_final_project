Light explodes on diamonds painting prisms, spilling rainbows on the floor
Gold martini goddess sips on vodka while white collars stalk the girls,
And the big suits buy their
LA Love, burns like the summer sun
Only love you when you're someone
Only love you when you're someone
LA Love, hot like a loaded gun
Only love you when you're someone
Only love you when you're someone

Lounges buzz electric, low lit taverns sit back classy thick with smoke
Bar flies make impressions, hunt connections,
Laughing loud at dated jokes
Don't they all want that

LA Love, burns like the summer sun
Only love you when you're someone
Only love you when you're someone
LA Love, hot like a loaded gun
Only love you when you're someone
Only love you when you're someone
LA Love, burns like the summer sun x3

LA Love, burns like the summer sun
Only love you when you're someone
Only love you when you're someone
LA Love, hot like a loaded gun
Only love you when you're someone
Only love you when you're someone
