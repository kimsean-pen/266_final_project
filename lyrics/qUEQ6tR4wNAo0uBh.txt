Daddy was dumb
Said that I'd be something special
Brought me up tough
But I was a gentle human
Said that he loved
Each of my two million freckles
When I grew up, was gonna be a super star
I can't get a job so I live with my mom
I take her money but not quite enough
I sit in the car and I listen to static
She said I look fat but I look fantastic
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
I'm waking up
Lost in boxes outside Tesco
Look like a bum
Sipping codeine coca cola
Thought that I was
Northern Camden's own Flash Gordon
Sonic ray gun
Gonna be a superstar
I can't get a job so I live with my mom
I take her money but not quite enough
I make my own fun in grandmama's basement
Said I looked mad
She said I looked wasted
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
