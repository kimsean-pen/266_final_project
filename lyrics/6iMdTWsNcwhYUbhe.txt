I can tell by the way you walk you wanna be alone with him
'Cause you're pacing at an open door, you're waiting and you can't come in

Why do you make up all these stories
Made up your mind, decided for me

I can tell by the way you walk you wanna be alone with him

When you called me on the telephone I knew that you were miles away
'Cause the words that you said to me weren't hiding what you couldn't say

Plans sort of changed up for the weekend
Friend came to town been years since I seen him

I can tell by the way you talk you wanna be alone with him (alone with him)

(Ooh alone with him)
(Ooh alone with him)
(Ooh alone with him)
(Ooh alone with him)

He was in my dreams
What else could it mean

When you laugh at me behind my back I'll turn and you can run away
Will you tell him all the special things you told me you could never say

I never said I'd be yours only, I didn't know until you told me
If I go I won't be lonely, if I stay now you don't own me

I can tell by the way you smile your love is changing on a whim

Maybe I will and maybe I won't
Maybe I do and maybe I don't
Maybe I will and maybe I won't
Maybe I do and maybe I don't

(I can tell by the way you walk)
(Maybe I will and maybe I won't)
(I can tell by the way you walk)
(Maybe I do and maybe I don't)
(I can tell by the way you walk)
(Maybe I will and maybe I won't)
(Maybe I do and maybe I don't)
