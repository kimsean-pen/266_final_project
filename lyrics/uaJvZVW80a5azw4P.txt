Same old, same old
Another takeaway on the sofa
Scrolling our phones
Same old, same old
A weekend at your parents
Just tryna save up some dough
Hell no, hell no
Will we ever go for dinner at a fancy restaurant?
'Cause god forbid that you would ever
Take the time to plan something
You can't take a hint

Not asking for much
But if you want this love
You gotta give some variation
Baby, just use your imagination

You know I like a little romance, babe
So if you surprise me
I'll keep you up to show you
How much I appreciate
And now reciprocate
With things I know that you like

It's called give 'n' take
It's called give 'n' take
It's called give 'n' take
It's called give 'n' take
It's called give 'n' take

Same old, same old
Another day I cancel
'Cause you had to catch a show
Same old, same old
And you don't like my place
So I stay at yours three in a row
Hell no, hell no
Would I ever come back to flowers
Waiting for me at home?
'Cause god forbid that you would ever
Put me first on your list
Yeah, I'm just being honest

Not asking for much
But if you want this love
You gotta give some variation
Baby, just use your imagination

You know I like a little romance, babe
So if you surprise me
I'll keep you up late to show you
How much I appreciate
And now reciprocate
With things I know that you like

It's called give 'n' take
It's called give 'n' take
It's called give 'n' take
It's called give 'n' take
It's called give 'n' take

I'll keep you up late to show you
How much I appreciate
And now reciprocate
With things I know that you like

It's called give 'n' take
It's called give 'n' take
It's called give 'n' take
It's called give 'n' take
It's called give 'n' take
