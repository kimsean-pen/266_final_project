We're telling tales of communication,
Tall orders to fulfil
And the pastiche we've invented
Is serving every man
A love pays love for lying,
A true lie to believe
Ideas of lust and dying
All carefully conceived

We are the second generation
We are a nation of innovation
We are the second generation
We are a nation ...

America, america
The western dream is gone
America asleep,
Since mulberry's too long
Dry thoughts for the tenant
And still they come and go
So come and try to tell me
Things i already know

We are the second generation
We are a nation of innovations
We are the second generation
We are a nation ...

And now you stare at me so doggish
But your eyes won't make me cry
The flowers of romance are trembling
Another chance, another lie,
Another shadow for new fires
Ash-wednesday for the prey
And still no-jesus for you
Welcome to devastate

We are the second generation
We are a nation of innovations
We are the second generation
We are a nation of devastation

We're telling tales of communication,
Tall orders to fulfil
And the creatures we've invented
Are serving every man
Now we are loving with reluctance
Our hearts - they never grew
We are meeting in a garden
It's the taming of the shrew

And now you stare at me so doggish
But your eyes won't make me cry
The flowers of romance are trembling
Because our game was just a lie
And in the end we stand alone
All that we wanted ... we want it

We are the second generation
We are a nation of innovations
We are the second generation
We are a nation of devastation

Devastate ...

Devastate ...

Devastate ...
