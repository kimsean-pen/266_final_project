You know I still love you baby
And it will never change
Saranghae

I want Nobody, Nobody but you
I want Nobody, Nobody but you
How can I be with another I don't want any other
I want Nobody, Nobody
Nobody, Nobody

Why you try to
To make me leave you
I know what you're thinking baby why arent you listening?
How can I just
Just love someone else and forget you completely
When I know you still love me?

Telling me you're not good enough
My life with you is just too tough
You know it's not right so just stop and come back boy
How can this be when we were meant to be?

I want Nobody, Nobody but you
I want Nobody, Nobody but you
How can I be with another I don't want any other
I want Nobody, Nobody
Nobody, Nobody
I want Nobody, Nobody but you
I want Nobody, Nobody but you
How can I be with another I don't want any other
I want Nobody, Nobody
Nobody, Nobody

Why can't we just
Just be like this cause
It's you that I need and nothing else until the end
Who else can ever
Make me feel the way I
I feel when I'm with you no one will ever do

Telling me you're not good enough
My life with you is just too tough
You know me enough so you know what I need boy
Right next to you is where I need to be

I want Nobody, Nobody but you
I want Nobody, Nobody but you
How can I be with another I don't want any other
I want Nobody, Nobody
Nobody, Nobody
I want Nobody, Nobody but you
I want Nobody, Nobody but you
How can I be with another I don't want any other
I want Nobody, Nobody
Nobody, Nobody

I dont want Nobody, body
I dont want Nobody, body
Honey you know
It's you that I want
It's you that I need
Why can't you see?

I want Nobody, Nobody but you ([YeEun] Buy you)
I want Nobody, Nobody but you ([YeEun] But you)
How can I be with another I don't want any other
I want Nobody, Nobody
Nobody, Nobody ([YeEun] Nobody, Nobody)

I want Nobody, Nobody but you ([SunYe] No body)
How can I be with another I don't want any other

Back to the days when we were so young and wild and free
Nothing else matters other than you and me so tell me why can't it be
Please let me live my life my way why do you push me away
I don't want Nobody, Nobody, Nobody, Nobody but you
