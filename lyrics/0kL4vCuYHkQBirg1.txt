Alright

Hey little sister
Do you know what time it was
When you finally seen all your broken dreams
Come crashing down your door
They demand an answer
And they demand it quick
Or the questions fade and then the wasted days
Come crawling back for more
And I said, do you know where the power lies
And who pulls the strings

Do you know where the power lies
It starts and ends with you
The face of isolation
Well that's one you recognize
Well you can't get straight

It's a lonely place
And one you do despice
Boredom is for sale now
And helplessness you feel
It's a wounded dove and the hawks are above
Blood splattered in a reel to reel
And I said, do you know where the power lies
And who pulls the strings?
Do you know where the power lies?
It starts and ends with you

Yeah, I was almost over

And my world was almost gone
And in a sudden rush, I could almost touch
The things that I'd done wrong
My jungle's made of concrete
Through the silence I could feel
Ho my aim is true and I will walk on through
These mountains made of steel
And I say, do you know where the power lies
And who pulls the strings?
Do you know where the power lies?

It starts and ends with you

Ohh, I say it starts and ends with you
I say it starts and ends with you!
