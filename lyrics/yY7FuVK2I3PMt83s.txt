At the stories beginning, starts a sad mystery
A tale that's sure to stain dark history!
A tale that's sure to stain dark history!

My eyes are gazing window shades are open wide
I sit back in pure awe and stare at the girl that will change my life!

She'll never know, she will never expect
I'm watching, admiring in secrets!
She'll never know, she will never expect
I'm watching, admiring in secrets!

While she sits there all alone, on her own she can't defend
I'm watching in, I'm watching in, like an arcane guardian
I spy with my wretched eye, she's like a drug that intensifies
demented minds, but I will strive
to have her forever by my side

Forever mine!

You're lost and lonely
it's ordinary
you stalk and you stare
she's my new neighbor
obsessed it's scary
can you blame me?
your logic's hazy
I'm not crazy!

She'll never know, she will never expect
The nightmare that is up on stage next!
She'll never know, she will never expect
The nightmare that is up on stage next!

While she sits there all alone, on her own she can't defend
I'm watching in, I'm watching in, like an arcane guardian
I spy with my wretched eye, she's like a drug that intensifies
Demented minds, but I will strive
to have her forever by my side
to have her forever by my side!

I'm watching in!
I'm watching in! (She'll never know!)
I'm watching in! (She will never expect!)
I'm watching in!
