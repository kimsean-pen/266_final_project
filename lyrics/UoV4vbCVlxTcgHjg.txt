I be wylin' cause I'm young
Wyl wylin cause I'm young
Wylin' cause I'm young
Wyl wylin cause I'm young
I be wylin' cause I'm young
I be wylin' cause I'm young
And I be wylin til I'm chill and old

Liquor all night love it!
Untamed youth and coupes move like bullets
I guess the fact my father smoked and drink
Made a young n-gga destiny to do the exact same
Young wylin me and all my codi's
Watch the phoney and hoes they couldn't blew me
Dark skinned china dog with the fake tits
Ice grillin' my spanish chick, word
We all in together now we all fear cops be buggin
Shotguns on the whip, f-ck em
I will never sweat for a piggy
You catch me high it's all good no biggie

I be wylin' cause I'm young
Wyl wylin cause I'm young
Wylin' cause I'm young
Wyl wylin cause I'm young
I be wylin' cause I'm young
I be wylin' cause I'm young
And I be wylin til I'm chill and old

4 in the morning getting cosy
So much goose, I let the fry soak it up some
Tuesday weekly, the legend of the rager
Most have witnessed the Cud' in the club
I don't have Plain Pat ready
Ice is strong and the whole crew gone
Done off the better, girls they love it, totally
Fuck the blogs, imma tell my story
No matter the phase, my name is engraved
In the minds of the young
To be living til' their grave
You live and you learn
Doing bumps in the day
Keep blunts to burn

Wyl wylin cause I'm young
Wylin' cause I'm young
Wyl wylin cause I'm young
I be wylin' cause I'm young
I be wylin' cause I'm young
And I be wylin til I'm chill and old
I be wylin' cause I'm young
Wyl wylin cause I'm young
Wylin' cause I'm young
Wyl wylin cause I'm young
I be wylin' cause I'm young
I be wylin' cause I'm young
And I be wylin til I'm chill and old

Rage, cause I'm paid
Take the gray and create another shade
Awesome no more b-tches playin possom
Pop and lock em and send em on home
Tired of hoes all they want is to get chose
Know the code when a women with some toes
Optimo taking trips to Australia
Do some blow and hope you make through the show
Hands high, go with your soul
And try floating through the sky
Hide your pain with some p-ssy and mamosa's
Costa Rica next on the agenda

I be wylin' cause I'm young
Wyl wylin cause I'm young
Wylin' cause I'm young
Wyl wylin cause I'm young
I be wylin' cause I'm young
I be wylin' cause I'm young
And I be wylin til I'm chill and old I be wylin' cause I'm young
Wyl wylin cause I'm young
Wylin' cause I'm young
Wyl wylin cause I'm young
I be wylin' cause I'm young
I be wylin' cause I'm young
And I be wylin til I'm chill and old
