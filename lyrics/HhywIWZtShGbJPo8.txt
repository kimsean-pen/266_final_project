Look at the day, that is dawning
What do you see with your eyes?
Think of me now, while you're yawning,
sunshine the tears from my cries
What I see I know is real,
what I touch I know I feel
If I don't care for what you say,
it won't mean much to me today
For I see your world that is living,
my mind is yours, yours is mine
Don't talk to me bout forgiving,
so much to do, no more time
All my love goes straight to you
with just a thought for something new
All I have is what you feel
with hands in mouth, you gently kneel
What I see I know is real,
what I touch I know I feel
All my love goes straight to you,
all my love is you
There's a place where I can go,
where I listen to the wind singing
Songs of happiness I know,
and it brings it all back again
Somewhere deep inside of me,
there's a song that I can sing
Jigsaw puzzles on a tree,
and it brings it all back again
Will the day be warm and bright,
or will it snow?
There are people waiting here
who really want to know
And sometimes I think of wine,
songs and laughter flowing free
People talking all the time,
and it brings it all back to me
Will the day be warm and bright,
or will it snow?
There are people waiting now
who really have to know
Can't you feel it in the air?
I wonder what it's meant to be
Its the thought that can't be spared,
and it brings it all back to me
Yes it brings it all back to me
Oooh
