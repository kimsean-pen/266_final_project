$carecrow, $carecrow
Aye
R.I.P

Playa hataz surround me
Like vultures on a dead body
Get the fuck from 'round me
Ain't tryna be ya' fuckin' friend
White boy with the nappy hair
Bought the platinums, nah not double-O bruh
Bunch of [?]
30 somethin' motherfucker ballin'
Hell headass walkin' off this playa nuts
Test your luck, might catch slugs
This that middle finger up
Shit, fuck a bitch
And fuck you too for thinkin' we would not make it [?]
How does it feel?
If you would ever feel livin' the vision that we livin'
[?] competition
We got the leverage [?]
47's 45's Tec's [?]

R.I.P boy
Ain't broke
I gotta a lotta fuckin' bread
Now I've seen the globe
Puff another load
Sitting in the [?] lead pipe
My pipe got [?]
Fuckboys that follow, yeah
Fill up that hollow stomach with my sorrow
Tomorrow we promise to tone down the swallow
Put roxycodone in the [?] and snort it
Always fall short
Standin' tall with my vice, fuck y'all for the sport
The money, the bitches, the fame feelin' like a whore
Now I'm smokin' more quartz and I'm closer to death
Then I was when I was poor
Coke and bitches in the kitchen passin' out on the couch
I'm tired from bein' bored
You'll die from bein' bored

Sing a sad ass song with just four chords, oh lord
Sing a sad ass song, another death in the 7th Ward, oh lord
Sing a sad ass song for Yung Snow, pullin' in, I was at the morgue
Sing a sad ass song for another tally on
the sword blizzard storm when I fucking mourn
