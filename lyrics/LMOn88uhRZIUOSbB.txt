(I'm leaving you)
(I'm not sure if that's what I should do)
(It hurts so bad)
(I'm wanting you but cant go back)
(Trying to find, to find)
(That all elusive piece of mind)
(Stuck here somehow)
(Shrouded beneath my fear and doubt)
(And I don't need it)

(Cuz I'm walkin down this road alone and figured all I'm thinking bout is you, is you my love)
(And my head is in a cloud of rain and the world it seems so far away and i'm just waiting for)
(The droplets, droplets)

You left a mark
I wear it proudly on my chest
Above my heart
To remind me that I feel the best
When I'm with you
And everything is effortless
You know its true
My eyes are painted with regret and I don't need it

Cuz I'm walkin down this road alone
and figured all I'm thinking 'bout is you, is you, my love
My head is in a cloud of rain and the world it seems so far away
And I'm just waiting to fall and sink into your skin
You are like the raindrops, the raindrops falling down on me

You left a mark (you left a mark)
She left a mark (he left)
She left (he left)
She left a mark
And I don't (I don't)
Need it. (Need it)
