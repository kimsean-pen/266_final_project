Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
(Instrumental)

I remember they would say:
"It's all okay, it'll be alright"
Every night, i could hear it,
I remember.
I could hear it in the wind that melody
That they would play every single day
To remind us it was over.

And it went
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
And it went
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
(Instrumental)
And it went
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
And it went
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh

I remember they would say:
"It's all okay, it'll be alright"
Every night, i could hear it
I remember
I could hear it in the wind that melody
That they would play every single day
To remind us it was over.

And it went
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
And it went
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh
Oh whoa ooo whoa oh

I remember
