Another thick red beam
Another black-top town
Another misspelled band burning their own houses down
Another pine-box tomb to fill the cemetery dead
Another star, a touch of orange over purgatory grey
Another void to fill
Just scattered fruitless seed
Another song I wrote that's too long
God knows no one needs
More misguided ghosts, more transparent hands
We'll drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our riot dance
Beneath another burning sky, behind our parented verses
Scores of catatonic smile covered assholes in a ship
Layered by the school, so you can definitely see
Can you forget these things?
Perfection from the paper thief
Perfection you project on me
Behind the window shades
I'm semi-conscious, already sleepin' in the bed I made
That most unrestful bed, that most original sin
What they act when I let ambition win
I'd hate to let you down
Thrown in a web with all his lies
Drown my dull reflection in a naive expectation arise
Back in the casket park
Back when I felt most free
I few a picture and nowhere God they knew me
So before the wretched men resume
Before their dreaded son appears
My driver's waiting
So let's make one thing crystal clear
You see a fraudulent form
I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
I'm no savior of yours, you're not friend of mine
You see a fraudulent form
I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours, you're no friend of mine

I see myself in the reflection of people's eyes
Realizing what they see may not be even close to the image I see in myself
And I think I might actually be more afraid
I feel like they know the story
I saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
Twelve years ago, I stood on the shore
Jumped in and grabbed the coat
And the river is rushing toward a waterfall
And my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat
And swim back to land
I let go of the coat but the coat won't let go of me
In any case please let know if there's more I can give you
If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful
