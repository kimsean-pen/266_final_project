I'm dead and dank and rotten
My arms are wrapped in cotton
My corpse loves you, let's marry

(Get smart, once) Every night at sleepy time
(Get smart, twice) I hang my skin out on the line
(Get smart, sing) Oh, darling, would you be, be mine

I'm in love, I think I'm in love ]
I'm in love, I think I'm in love ]
I'm in love, I think I'm in love ] (Chorus)

I'm caught in a mesh of veins
My fingers and flesh and brains
My skull gives head, so let's wed

(Get smart, once) Every night when all alone
(Get smart, twice) I drape my flesh around the phone
(Get smart, pray) Oh, darling, would you be my own

(Chorus)

Don't cry, beautiful, it's just a phase
To the father and the son and the holy ghost
I chant and I pray, I love

You know, God works in mysterious ways
To the father and the son and the holy ghost
I sing and I pray, I love

I'm soft and slightly stinking
My arms are small and shrinking
My lips kiss dirt, oh, let's flirt

(Get smart, once) Every night at half past one
(Get smart, twice) There's a little taste of things in come
(Get smart, chant) Oh, darling, can I be your son

(Chorus)

Don't scream, baby, it's just a coma
To the father and the son and the holy ghost
I chant and I pray, I love

You go to heaven, I go to Roma
To the father and the son and the holy ghost
I sing and I pray, I love
