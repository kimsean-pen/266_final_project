Dismal looming current
A darkness I call my own
Fuck all the extra
Won't take no for an answer

Torn by temptation
Suffocated for a spell
Though temptation does not sleep softly
When entombed in the womb where it swelled
And swelled
And swelled

It's beyond hushing and hiding away
The damnation of this plane

Eternal conflict
I can't come to terms
Eons and eons of darkness interred
What the fuck is it worth?
All of the hurt

I plead

Martyr me heavenly hands
Mold the impossible product
Cut lines and shapes
Slave away
Until I ooze perfect incarnate
Martyr me heavenly hands
Mold the impossible product
Cut lines and shapes
Slave away
Until I ooze perfect incarnate

It's beyond hushing and hiding away

Damnation on display

Dismal looming current
A darkness I call my own
Blocking all the extra bullshit out
As I squeeze blood from this stone
Torn by temptation
Suffocated for a spell
Though temptation does not sleep softly
When entombed in the womb where it swelled

Out on the edge of the earth
I look down
See the universe from up above
Sleeping sound
It's indifferent
Cutthroat and cold
Will I make it back?
Will I make it back whole?
Any compromise I welcome it
The honey of my soul I cherish it
This vessel is wearing thin
On the edge of the earth and I want back in

Martyr me heavenly hands
Mold the impossible product
Cut lines and shapes
Slave away
Until I ooze perfect incarnate

It's beyond hushing and hiding away

Now tell me
What the fuck is it worth?

All of the hurt
All of the pain
Tell me

All of the hurt
All of the pain

What the fuck is it worth?

I want back in
