You're so perfect, heaven blessed
Never felt a love like this
Why you wonder so helpless
Sounds so crazy, I must confess
There ain't a thing I wouldn't sacrifice
'Cause I won't let you go without a fight

Pieces of a dream unfolding
What happened to the fairy tale?
Words of love are never spoken
Things in life aren't always fair
I'll protect you and I'll guide you
And I'll give you all the love that is mine
Just know in time you'll be fine

Places, faces aren't to blame
I promise forever my love won't change
Be strong, hold on, don't let go
What's a perfect ending, no one knows
There ain't a thing I wouldn't sacrifice
'Cause I won't let you go without a fight

Pieces of a dream unfolding
What happened to the fairy tale?
Words of love are never spoken
Things in life aren't always fair
I'll protect you and I'll guide you
And I'll give you all the love that is mine
Just know in time

Pieces of a dream unfolding
What happened to the fairy tale?
Words of love are never spoken
Things in life aren't always fair
I'll protect you and I'll guide you
And I'll give you all the love that is mine
Just know in time you'll be fine

You're so perfect, heaven blessed
