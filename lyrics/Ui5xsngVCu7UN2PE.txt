Can you hold me in your arms?
Can you stay a little longer?
Just a day, a week, a month
Just some time and
I'll be stronger

Gone is my pride
All through the night
Go on and lie
Straight to my face
Tell me you that love me
Even though you don't

'Til I can get by on my own
Until I can make it
Without you
Don't let go
'Til I can wake up
All alone in my bed
Look to my left
Ooh, not going crazy without you
Just hold me close
'Til I can get by on my own

I know your heart's with
Someone else
You dream of unfamiliar places
Now all I ask is a little help
Some help to ease me
Through these phases

Go on and fool me
Like in the movies
Pretend everything gon' be ok
Tell me you still want me
Even though you don't

'Til I can get by on my own
Until I can make it
Without you
Don't let go
'Til I can wake up all
Alone in my bed
Look to my left
Ooh, not going crazy
Without you
Just hold me close
'Til I can get by on my own

I don't know how to live
Without you, baby
So just hold me tight

'Til I can get by on my own
Until I can make it without you
Don't let go
'Til I can wake up all alone in my bed
Look to my left
Ooh, not going crazy without you
Just hold me close
'Til I can get by on my own
