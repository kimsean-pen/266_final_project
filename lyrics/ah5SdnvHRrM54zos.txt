Walking on the gallows ground, rope tightly around the neck
Raven-bird on each shoulder waiting for the pick
Chasing for the shadows, ideal that does not exist
On the endless road leading to nowhere

Let the sounds and light wash over
Bathe the darkest corners of melancholy
Blow burning flames into your soul
Reveal the thruth between the lines

In this world every hour wounds
Every second draws blood
Every moment delivers pain
If you choose so

In this world every hour kills
Every minute seeps despair
There is nothing but suffering
If you choose so

Walking on the gallows ground,
Rope tightly around the neck
Flock of vultures circling above,
Waiting for the feast
Reaching through the blackest sky
For the brightest star
Seeking for the guidance
From the night that never dawns

Guided by empty promises
Charmed by hollow words
No truth or answers could be found
Nothing but years numbered in me

Gods are great, but the heart, the heart is greater
From our wounds they're born, from our sadness they grow
Gods are strong, but the mind, the mind is stronger
In our scars they dwell, but in our hearts they burn
