My friends turn me on
I live for drugs

I get drugs free, I live for drugs
I get drugs free
My friends turn me on
I can't afford, I would never buy drugs
I get drugs free

Here where I will sit alone, lost
Here I will dream why give me a drink
I need to think now
I've got to rid my stinkin' brain

Just lately I freaked out very very badly
Just lately I freaked out on acid

Black boots, highway broads
Black boots, highway broads
Black boots, highway broads
Black boots, highway broads

Dope forever, forever loaded
Dope forever, forever loaded
Dope forever, forever loaded
Dope forever, forever loaded

If you better need time to sleep
Forgive my problems before I awake
And it's time to go out
So what we can change [Incomprehensible]

I get drugs free
I live for drugs

Here where I will sit alone lost
Here I will dream why, give me a drink
I need to think now
I gotta rid my stinkin' brain

Of ages nice, how much people promises
Knocking at the door

I live for drugs
