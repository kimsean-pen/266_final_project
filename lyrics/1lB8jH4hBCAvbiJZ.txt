I see you walking down the street
Just like candy, oh so sweet
You take my mind

I just wanna talk to you
Maybe have a drink or two
It ain't no crime

I've never seen you here before
Now I wanna see some more
Can't get enough

Maybe if I take a risk
It must be when I steal your kiss
'so make that cuffs?'

But I'm no good for you
And you're no good for me
We'll be as bad as we can be
Wait and see
Since I'm no good for you
And you're no good for me
Let's be as bad as we can be
You and me

I know you think I'm telling lies
But as we have it in your mind
As we believe

I knew you make it, let me walk you home
Be alone could be so all alone
Stick with me

But I'm no good for you
And you're no good for me
We'll be as bad as we can be
Wait and see
Since I'm no good for you
And you're no good for me
Let's be as bad as we can be
You and me

I'm waiting all night
I'm feeling all right
Waiting my whole life for you

I'm waiting all night
I'm feeling all right
Waiting my whole life for you

I've never felt this way before
I wanna feel it more and more
With you're here

I just wanna feel your charm
Just like a tattoo on my arm
I 'care' to see

But I'm no good for you
And you're no good for me
We'll be as bad as we can be
Wait and see
Since I'm no good for you
And you're no good for me
Let's be as bad as we can be
Let's be as bad as we can be
We'll be as bad as we can be
You and me
You and me
You and me
You and me
