Here we go again, another night of being bumped
I'll keep to myself, avoid the sun
And cancel plans with everyone
I know, 'cause it's just how it always ends
Our bond will break 'cause you can't relate
To anyone, to anything at all

You brought your worst and I'm right here
Now I've seen it all and it's never been so clear

You're not the person that I knew back then
It's all too late to set things right 'cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then
Let's try and act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends like you ever had them

You still know me, still not cut out for this sort of thing
Never want to be caught in between
I need constant reminders of everything
So what! It's who I am, I think I played it off so well
I just hold it in no matter how I've been

So nobody, nobody can tell
You brought your worst and I'm right here

No one's seen it all, it's never been so clear
You're not the person that I knew back then
It's all too late to set things right 'cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then

Let's try and act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends like you ever had them

I won't sleep till the break of dawn
(Break of dawn!)

Can't let our problems find me here
So everybody come on!

You brought your worst and I'm right here
I've seen it all, and it's never been so clear
You're not the person that I knew back then
It's all too late to set things right 'cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then
Let's try and act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends like you ever had them
You're not the person that I knew back then
It's all too late to set things right 'cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then
Let's try and act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends like you ever had them
