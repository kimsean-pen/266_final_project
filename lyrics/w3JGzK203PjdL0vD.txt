I'd be lying through my teeth if I told you
That I'm ok
July came, I thought I had it all together
Until you said
"I need some space"
Truth be told
It's so hard to wait

One eye on the clock
And one on the phone
It's 5: 19...
I'm feeling alone
If I could talk to you
I'd want you to know
I'm holding loose
But ain't letting go.

We both know that I could think myself dizzy
Right now I'm spinning around
You said, "baby, don't worry"
But I just miss you right now
I said, I miss you right now

One eye on the clock
And one on the phone

It's 5: 19...
I'm feeling alone
If I could talk to you
I'd want you to know
I'm holding loose
But ain't letting go.

Baby, take all the time you need
I just want you to know
I'll be here, waiting

With one eye on the clock
And one on the phone
It's 5: 19...
I'm feeling alone
If I could talk to you
I'd want you to know
I'm holding loose
But ain't letting go.

ooooo...
Ain't letting go
