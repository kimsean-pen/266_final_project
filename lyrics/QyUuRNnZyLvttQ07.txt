A brave morning
Thoughts flap their wings and fly
And I can still taste defeat on my lips
Bright tie fish fly
I have not yet arrived
How can i not admit
I need to know you
Cause I just want to be
Something more than the mud
In your eyes
I want to be the clay in your hands
Hey sorrow where are you tomorrow?
Just won't be the same without you here
I'll wish for shoulders bold and broad
To bear and strength to hold my head Above them
Cause I just want to be something more than the mud
In your eyes
I want to be the clay in your hands

Cause gloria is silent
Gloria is silent
Gloria is silent
And glory is a silent thing
