I hear a voice from ten thousand miles away
I have no choice, our love was meant to stay
With or without, it's easy for me without a doubt
As I spend my days, searching for ways
Love is on the go, so is radio

CHORUS
Russian radio
How will we ever believe you?
Radio
Now that we've learned to deceive you

BRIDGE
There is a sound, it's underground
Moving out for miles around
There is a sound, it's underground
Let's move it out, boys

I hear a voice from one hundred miles away
Getting so much closer every day
With or without, it's easy for me without a doubt
As I spend my days searching for ways
Love is on the go, so is radio

CHORUS

There is a sound
There is a sound

BRIDGE

I feel our love is only a smile away
Getting so much closer to me every day
With or without, it's easy for us without a doubt
As we spend our days searching for ways
Love is on the go, so is radio
