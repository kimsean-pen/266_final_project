Oooh they're coming for you
Waiting in the wings
Stand up
Preying on you
For you ready to eat

Ooh but you know they all talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
No there ain't nothing up their sleeve
So close your eyes
And begin to dream

They all talk, talk, talk
Crawl inside my head
They all bark, bark, bark
Gonna crawl into nest

They all talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Sit, eyes bloodshot red
All bark, bark, bark
Caught in the middle

Ooh better watch your back
Twitch, tick
Keep pulling that open weaving within sleep
Don't forget, God knows how best to show it's teeth

They all talk, talk, talk
Crawl inside my head
They all bark, bark, bark
Clouding my ends

They all talk talk talk
Am I going bad?
Bark, bark, bark
Or caught in the middle
They all talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Don't matter what was said

They all bark, bark, bark
Am I departing by the minute?
They all talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
My god they
They all bark, bark, bark
I am caught up in the middle
