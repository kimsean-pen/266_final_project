Strip away the flesh and bone
Look beyond the lies you've known

Everbody wants to talk about a freak
no one wants to dig that deep
let me take you Underneath

Baby better watch your step
never mind what's on the left

Your gonna see things you might not wanna see
it's still not that easy for me
Underneath

A Red River of screams
Underneath
Tears in my eyes
Underneath
Stars in my Black and blue sky
and Underneath
under my skin
Underneath

The depths of my sin
Look at me now do you see?

Welcome to my world of truth
I dont wanna hide any part of me from you

I'm standing here with no apologies
such a beautiful release
you inside of me

A Red River of screams
Underneath
Tears in my eyes
Underneath
Stars in my Black and blue sky
and Underneath
under my skin
Underneath

The depths of my sin
Look at me now do you see?

Strip away the flesh and bone
Look beyond the lies you've known

I'm standing here with no apologies
such a beautiful release
you inside of me

Baby better watch your step
Never mind what's on the left

You're gonna see things you might not wanna see
It's still not that easy for me
Underneath

A Red River of screams
Underneath
Tears in my eyes
Underneath
Stars in my Black and blue sky
and Underneath
under my skin
Underneath

The depths of my sin
Look at me now do you see?

A Red River of screams
Underneath
Tears in my eyes
Underneath
Stars in my Black and blue sky
and Underneath
under my skin
Underneath

The depths of my sin
Look at me now do you see?
