Take a picture, put me on camera
Do I look good, am I what you want
Get my hopes up, go on, get my hair done
I can be the girl, watch me give it all I got

Little breakdowns, silly little breakdowns
Hit the gas, go past, back again
Need it so bad, this could be the real thing
So loud, so still you feel my heart sing

Break free, we can just ride
Hands around my waist, any second we can die
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Make me shiver inside, lean into the curve
I think you better hold on tight
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

You're like my Harley, Harley, Harley
Honey, honey, honey
Harley, Harley, Harley
Honey, honey, honey
Harley, Harley, Harley
Honey, honey, honey
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Slow it down, wanna feel everything
My emotions running and they turn me on
So alive now, I'm just gonna let go
Close your eyes, this ride has just begun
Little break downs, silly little break downs
Hit the gas, go past, back again
Need it so bad, this could be the real thing
So loud, still you feel my heart sing

Break free, we can just ride
Hands around my waist, any second we can die
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Make me shiver inside, lean into the curve
I think you better hold on tight
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

I can be the girl, watch me give it all I got
I can be the girl, watch me give it all I got
I can be the girl, watch me give it all I got

Break free, we can just ride
Hands around my waist, any second we can die
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Make me shiver inside, lean into the curve
I think you better hold on tight
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

You're like my Harley, Harley, Harley
Honey, honey, honey
Harley, Harley, Harley
Honey, honey, honey
Harley, Harley, Harley
Honey, honey, honey
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
