I was shot
By a Pistol made of bones
I got got
By a bullet it's made of stones
Oh the earth fuel the flame
But it was only me to blame
I was shot
By a Pistol made of bones

The shooter was
A mean and mighty ghost
Ooh yeah
He hated me
Because I loved him most

The ones you should fear
Are often oh so near
I was shot
By a pistol made of bones

Oh how could I be so blind?
But the man was with me all the time

The ones you should fear
Are often oh so near
I was shot
I was shot
By a pistol made of bones
