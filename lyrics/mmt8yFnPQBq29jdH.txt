On the floor, broken down
Now I'll be cold broken heart
I thought we were perfect
I guess I don't deserve ya'
I thought that we would make it
I thought this was forever

Back on my mind I wasn't you
This was and this got to be your
Thought you was mine thought to be your
But I was a moment for you

I was a moment but you never told me
I was your man I was a part of your back
You got me so fed up
Why you mess my head up?
Lied on me I'd never
Oh girl you're so clever

Blame like a fire
Told me I'm like a paper
Broke me down on fever
I guess I should know better than you trust, trust
Better than you trust

All alone and teach us hide it all
End up like this got me going crazy
Vision barely hazy
Loosing breath like daily
I thought that I would maybe

Wake up of those bad dreams
But it still growth and I can't sleep
Like no meals and I can't eat
Like no air and I can't breath

I was a moment but you never told me
I was your man I was a part of your back
You got me so fed up
Why you mess my head up?
Lied on me I'd never
Oh girl you're so clever

Blame like a fire
Told me I'm like a paper
Broke me down on fever
I guess I should know better than you trust, trust
Better than you trust, trust

You got me so fed up
Why you mess my head up?
Lied on me I'd never
Oh girl you're so clever

Blame like a fire
Told me I'm like a paper
Broke me down on fever
I guess I should know better than you trust, trust
Better than you trust
