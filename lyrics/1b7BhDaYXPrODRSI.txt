Yes it was all my fault
It was all my fault
I held the bow and arrow
I'm steady, it was my shot

I wanted to see
How far it will go
I wanted to see
How far it will go

Open my heart
I have a vision but there is no part
Open my heart
I have a vision but there is no part

Yes you called all the shots
I like it whether I like it or not
Was our love worth a lot?
I won't till it's fine and gone

I wanted to feel
Anything at all
I wanted to know
How far I could fall

Open my heart
I have a vision but there is no part
Open my heart
I have a vision but there is no part

Open my heart
I have a vision but there is no part
Open my heart
I have a vision but there is no part
