It comes a'calling in the evenin'
When the temperature is dropping out
They said it don't get cold here
But I beg to differ now

There is something in the shadows
More than sister silhouette
Something sinister and strange
That I haven't seen yet

And I don't wanna be alone
Sky, don't let the sun go
I'm not ready for the darkness
Swear upon a heartless soul

And I don't wanna cry when you go
Stay a little longer, you know
You're making me feel
I'm not alone

You don't have to fight the bad guys
Throwing punches out into the black
If you have to tell me lies, I don't care
Just give me some good back

And I don't wanna be alone
Sky, don't let the sun go
I'm not ready for the darkness
Swear upon a heartless soul

And I don't wanna cry when you go
Stay a little longer, you know
You're making me feel
I'm not alone

And if I only worry 'bout it, worry 'bout it, worry 'bout it
I just keep breaking down, breaking down, breaking down
Boy, I could do without, do without, do without
A night of the bad dreams, sad things
Tell me what does that mean

I don't wanna be alone
Sky, don't let the sun go
I'm not ready for the darkness
Swear upon a heartless soul

And I don't wanna cry when you go
Stay a little longer, you know
You're making me feel
That monsters aren't real
You're making me feel
I'm not alone
I'm not alone, no
I'm not alone, no
(I'm not alone)
