Now there's a girl about town I'd like to know
I'd like to slip away with you
And if you said you love me how could I mind?
Is there another side to everything you do?

Take in the country air
You'll never win

Gentlemen take polaroids
They fall in love they fall in love
Gentlemen take polaroids
They fall in love they fall in love

Breathe life into me
Spin me round
And I'll just sit and wonder why
Just a foreign town with a foreign mind
Why is everything so cut and dried?

The taste of country air you'll never know

Gentlemen take polaroids
They fall in love they fall in love
Gentlemen take polaroids
They fall in love they fall in love

Take in the country, ah you'll never win

Gentlemen take polaroids
They fall in love they fall in love
Gentlemen take polaroids
They fall in love they fall in love
