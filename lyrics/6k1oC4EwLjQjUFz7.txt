For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe
And discuss all the vast intracacies of life
We could jaw, through the night
Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like
Oh yeah

But we always came back to the song
we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back to the song
we were singing
At any particular time

Take a sip, see the world through a glass
And speculate about the cosmic solution
To the sound, blue guitars
Caught up in a philisophical discussion
Oh yeah

But we always came back to the song
we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back to the song
we were sing
At any particular time

For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe
And discuss all the vast intracacies of life
We could jaw, through the night
Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like
Oh yeah

But we always came back to the song
we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back to the song
we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back

Take a sip, see the world through a glass
And speculate about the cosmic solution
To the sound, blue guitars
Caught up in a philisophical discussion
Oh yeah

But we always came back to the song
we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back to the song
we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah
We always came back to the song we were
singing
