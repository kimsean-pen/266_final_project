Warm and low, stole from thieves
Confusion so down with these
Selected friends, sworn enemies
Oh, tell me what you need
Breathless

Second sight in abstract mode
See how it reads more high than it shows
Exercise and better clothes
Oh, tell me what you know

Sunlight ready
Keep it warm and low
Sunlight ready
Keep it warm and low

An invisible thing to contemplate
Pushed us too far behind the gates
With too much love to ever recreate

Sunlight ready
Keep it warm and low
Sunlight ready
Keep it warm and low

Out of sight
Keep it warm and low
