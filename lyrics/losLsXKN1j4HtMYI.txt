Seven days I'm going to call the wild in me
Carrying me, 'cross the world
Seven days I'm yours, I live all I need
To carry me to the north
You know if I couldn't find the way to spend my days with you
Oh you know I would
You know if I couldn't not find the way to work it out with you
Oh you know I would

Seven days that can belong that you lit a fire in me
When you told me I could go
Seven days, that can be hard when you lose all you need
Oh you aim, aim your heart

You know if I couldn't find the way to spend my days with you
Oh you know I would
You know if I couldn't not find the way to work it out with you
Oh you know I would
