I see the beauty in
The miracles revelead
I need the golden sparkles
Just to climb the tree
But sometimes I get scared
And find it hard to stand
When all the violence
Is coming down on me

Sometimes I wonder
How can we ever be strong in this world
Without a hand that can lead us unhurt
How can we look into this empty face
All of us unembraced

I taste the bitter truth
That makes me understand
There are some questions
That might never be answered
And all their poison sweet
The prayers and belief
Just let them gently sleep
While I must stay awake

How can we ever be strong in this world
Without a hand that can lead us unhurt (lead us unhurt)
How can we look into this empty face
All of us unembraced

I'll stay awake (I'll stay awake)
I'll stay awake (I'll stay awake)

Oh can we try to be strong in this world?
We are the hand that can lead us unhurt (lead us unhurt)
Beauty of lies deep in the wonders unveiled
Love is the mirror for us to be free
Now take a look in our universe
Are you still unembraced
