Every search for truth leads me back to you
If the path's not clear, come and find me here
If love is a game, it doesn't feel the same to me
Still I live to breathe every word you say

Every action is just a reaction
But it feels like the first time
It's magnetic, it's attraction
Never stopping when it feels right

Don't slow down, move closer now
Every map I found
Oh it always leads back to you
Let's just try to escape this night
On an endless ride
Oh it always comes back to you

There's a place where I leave my heart untied
Keep the windows closed, hide the ghosts inside
The room was colder when you were holding me
It's a silver lining, so complete

Every action is just a reaction
But it feels like the first time
It's magnetic, it's attraction
Never stopping when it feels right

Don't slow down, move closer now
Every map I found
Oh it always leads back to you
Let's just try to escape this night
On an endless ride
Oh it always comes back to you

Run away, you could run away with me
Run away, you could run away with me
Run away, want you to run away with me
Run away, run away with me
