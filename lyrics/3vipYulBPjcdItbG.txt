Looking through the looking glass
All that seems won't ever last
Broken glass in every tree
Natural I never see
Slipping through my fingertips, like sand
Slipping through my fingertips, sand

Stare into the drinking glass
Walking slow, faces pass
Sipping through my fingertips, like sand
Sipping through my fingertips, each time
Sipping through my fingertips, sand
