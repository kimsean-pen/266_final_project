I caught the moon today
Pick it up and throw it away, all right
I got the perfect steal
A cleaner love with a dirty feel all right

Fallout and take the bait, eat the fruit
And kiss the snake goodnight
Common ruse, dirty face
Pretty noose is pretty hate

And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from

Let your motor race
Pick it up and get this mother gone
Out from and far away, the wooden stake
This thing has got me on

Diamond rope silver chain
Pretty noose is a pretty pain

And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from

Common ruse, dirty face
Pretty noose is pretty hate
I don't care what you got
I don't care what you need, I don't want anything

And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from

And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
