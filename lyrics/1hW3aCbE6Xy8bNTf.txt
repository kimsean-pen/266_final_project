Turn away, turn away
From me, from me
And I pray, yes, I pray
For the, for the, for the

Another world
Wrapped up inside another place
And I hope, and I pray that the pain goes away
Yes I pray, yes, I pray, yes I pray

Turn away, turn away
From me, from me
And I pray, yes, I pray
For the, for the, for the

Ba-pa-pa-da, ba-da
Ba-pa-pa-ah
Ba-pa-pa-da, ba-da
Ba-pa-pa-da, ba-da
Ba-pa-pa-ah
Ba-pa-pa-da, ba-da

Turn away, turn away
From me, from me
And I pray, yes, I pray
For the, for the, for the

Ba-pa-pa-da, ba-da
Ba-pa-pa-ah
Ba-pa-pa-da, ba-da
