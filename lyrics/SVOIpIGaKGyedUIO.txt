Good morning day
Sorry I'm not there
But all my favorite friends
Vanished in the air

It's hard to fly
When you can't even run
Once I had the world
But now I've got no one

If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to hold me down
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to push me around
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
Drown
Drown

Good morning day
Sorry you're not here
All those times before
Were never this unclear

It's hard to walk
When you can't even crawl
Once I had this world
But now I've lost it all

If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to hold me down
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to push me around
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
Drown

Rolling faster than I'm breathing
Drown
Rolling faster than I'm breathing
Drown
Rolling faster than I'm breathing

If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to hold me down
I would change my direction
And save myself before I (drown)
If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to push me around
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
(Save myself before I drown)
(Save myself before I drown)
(Save myself before I drown)
