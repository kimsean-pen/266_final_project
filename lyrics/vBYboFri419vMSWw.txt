Every breath I take
Leaves me parched for air
Every hand I touch
Causes skin to tear

Every flame approached
Blinds my eyes
Every word I write
Leaves me drained

I shall feel...

Still the blood
That fills my veins
Obliterate my hatred
This flesh enwrapped in pain

Every kiss of yours
Drenches my tongue with poison
Every emotion I feel
Tears a cleft into my heart

Every light in the dark
Fades as I advance
Every day I exist
I don't understand

I shall feel...

Still the blood
That fills my veins
Obliterate my hatred
This flesh enwrapped in pain

Earth to flesh, flesh to earth
Engulfed below this ruptured birth
This longing mind that you denied
A taste of life, this body died

Earth to flesh, flesh to earth
Engulfed below this ruptured birth
My words subside, this life is spent
Blind I remain, all shall end

Still the blood
That fills my veins
Obliterate my hatred
This flesh enwrapped in pain
