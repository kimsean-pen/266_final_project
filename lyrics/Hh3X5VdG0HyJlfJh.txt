If it falls, let it fall. If it dies, let it die.
Whatever we do, won't matter that much.
Puzzles and Wonders. Mysteries and such.

Yesterday, I had the longest ever dream,
That the world was endless with possibilities.
It had me thinking, one should never forget
That there are wonders, we haven't seen yet.

Seize a chance, follow a dream.
Be yourself, don't plan and scheme.
For what we do, won't matter that much.
Puzzles and wonders, mysteries and such.

So calculate and analyse.
My head is spinning from all of those lies.
It had me fooled, a logical mess.
In a time of facts, figures and distress.

Seize a chance, follow a dream.
Be yourself, don't plan and scheme.
For what we do, won't matter that much.
Puzzles and wonders, mysteries and such.
