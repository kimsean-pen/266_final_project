Through the night, we rise in pairs, lords at night we ride
From the depths of Hell's domain, reborn to reign this night
Roam throughout the endless wars, hold high his name we must
Warriors from the gates of Hell, in Lord Satan we trust

Stalking the night, can't you feel I'm near?
Watching each step that you take
I take lives and show all no mercy this night
Attack those not knowing their fate

Brothers of the Prince of Night by bargains we have made
Allies with the darkened souls, our legions, we must save
Fight for our eternal quest, God can't save you in time
Evil stalks the night with us, your soul it shall be mine

Stalking the night, can't you feel I'm near?
Watching each step that you take
I take lives and show all no mercy this night
Attack those not knowing my force

I am the menace in your eyes, the one you can't escape
Your life falls in my grasp, you know your end is near
You pray your God will help, His strength no match for mine
Your last hope slips away, thy soul begins to bleed
I tear your flesh to shreds, burn holes throughout your mind
Your eyes now filled with blood, a victim of my force
In endless agony, you realize your defeat
Recite my Master's chants, your soul now his to keep

Stalking the night, can't you feel I'm near?
Watching each step that you take
I take lives and show all no mercy this night
Attack those not knowing their fate
