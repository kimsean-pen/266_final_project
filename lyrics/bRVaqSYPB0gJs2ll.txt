I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you

1:
All this love that I am giving
Can it ever be enough
Let's go back to the beginning
Will it be the end of us

Pre-Give me a sign
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Throw my hands up high and surrender
You can count on me
You can count on me

I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you

2:
Cheating hearts lying eyes broken promises
I heard them all but they never hurt like this
I'm in the dark when we're aWart
And I miss the way you look right through me
No one else can move me

Pre-Give me a sign
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Throw my hands up high and surrender
You can count on me
You can count on me

I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you

Oh baby
I I
I I
Oh baby

I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you

Pre-Give me a sign
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Throw my hands up high and surrender
You can count on me
You can count on me

I know
I know
I know
I know
I never knew what I could feel
I will be there for you

I know
We got eachother baby
I know
We got eachother baby
I know
We got eachother baby
I know
I will be there for you
