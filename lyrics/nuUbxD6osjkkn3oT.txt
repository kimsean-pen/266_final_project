Hey, what's your name?
I think I like you, come a little closer now
Wait, what'd you say? Is that your girlfriend?
Think I'll be turning that around

Don't you wanna?
Don't you wanna?
Don't you wanna know
What it would feel like?

Let's be friends so we can make out
You're so hot, let me show you around
I see what I want and I wanna play
Everyone knows I'm getting my way

It doesn't matter what you say
I'm knocking you down, down, down
I'm knocking you down, down, down
I'm knocking you down

Hey, let me flip through the pages to something outrageous
Potentially maybe it could be more
But don't get your hopes up, first let's just hook up
Maybe you'll be what I'm looking for

Don't you wanna?
Don't you wanna?
Don't you wanna know
What it would feel like?

Let's be friends so we can make out
You're so hot, let me show you around
I see what I want and I wanna play
Everyone knows I'm getting my way

It doesn't matter what you say
I'm knocking you down, down, down
I'm knocking you down, down, down
I'm knocking you down

You got my permission
Don't need no admission
'Cause I'm on a mission

You got my attention
There's no need to mention
The way, the way you feel

'Cause you're in my vision
I need a decision
So take a position

There's no need to question
My every intention
'Cause this
'Cause this is real

Let's be friends so we can make out
You're so hot let me show you around
I see what I want and I wanna play
Everyone knows I'm getting my way
It doesn't matter what you say
I'm knocking you down, down, down
I'm knocking you down, down, down
I'm knocking you down, down, down
I'm knocking you down, down, down
Let's be friends so we can make out
You're so hot, let me show you around
I see what I want and I wanna play
Everyone knows I'm getting my way
It doesn't matter what you say
