Hell had you by the throat
You never got to heaven, but you got real close
Your past has you in a chokehold
But you deserve it, from what I've been told
Call my bluff, say what you want
I'm looking down at you

From the top
I beg for attention in small doses
Leave the scene smelling of dead roses

Loverboy
You're playing those hearts like toys
Don't you feel bad
Don't you feel bad

Feel bad for them
This is your night with arms wide open
I'm the option you shouldn't have chosen

Scared of the dark
The door's wide open
This is the night you'll regret in the morning

Loverboy
You're playing those hearts like toys
Don't you feel bad
Don't you feel bad

Feel bad for them
Given the choice
Would you do it again?
Of course, I would
Of course, I should
Love your friend
Friends with benefits
