Lonely, forgotten days, the city lights to paint the ways
The city air inside my lungs (Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)
The memories we made back then, forever splintered in my skin
Feeling like the only ones. (Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)

Years passed with these streets, losing what I keep
I know, I know the coast is where home is

They closed the venue we first played, we played a place in [?]
And with it went some piece of me (Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)
I'm losing chapters left behind, I'm losing constance all the time
If nothing else I have to see (Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)
If nothing else (If nothing else), If nothing else (If nothing else), If nothing else, I have to see

Years passed with these streets, losing what I keep
I know, I know the coast is where home is. Moments [?], lost and defenceless
I know, I know, the coast, the coast is where home is

We can't change and nothing will stay the same (in love with a past that's moving on)
Can't change and nothing will stay the same (still here but the feeling is gone)
Can't change and nothing will stay the same (in love with a past that's moving on)
Can't change and nothing will stay the same (still here but the feeling thats gone)
Still here but the feeling is gone
