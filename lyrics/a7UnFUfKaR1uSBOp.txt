Awakening from a profound slumber
Cognitive motions strive to the same encounter
Slowly vanishing from the same beholder

Once again you are facing these fences
In these vast lands you must strive
Climb the barriers to evolve and thrive
We definitely need to expand the possibilities
To become the heirs of what is surrounding us

Complex variations, multiple designs
Let the nature collide
Transmitting its unique way through

Find the inversion from the breach
Visualise the absence of time

Complex variations, multiple designs
Let the nature collide
Transmitting its unique way through

Awakening from a profound slumber
Cognitive motions strive to the same encounter
Slowly vanishing from the same beholder

You will return to the earth
From the ground you were born
