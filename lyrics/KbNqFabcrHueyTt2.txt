Oh oh oh woah oh oh
I need sunshine, I need angels I need
Something good yeah I need blue skies
I need them old times I need
Something good yeah something good
Something good yeah something good

All these days seem so far away when i want to see how far away
I've come
Back then, when i had not seen half them things i'd ever thought i'd see
Become someone i'd never thought i'd be
Oh woah oh oh
Cause there's something good,

Yeah I need sunshine, I need angels I need

Something good yeah I need blue skies

I need them old times I need
Something good yeah something good,
Something good yeah something good
Oh oh woah oh oh
All these days seem to fade away as i lost faith in myself
Question everything i stood for
No women left to look for in life
I began to lose all
Found it harder to cope
With everything around me
And them people that would doubt me
Oh i, i was in a place that i did not want to be
Seeing face after face that i didn't want to see hahayaya
I did not go out of my mind only God knows

And all them girls that i used to see running round
Was like the rain that i used to see pouring down ey ey eh-ey
It did nothing for me
'cause I need sunshine, I need angels I need
Something good yeah i need blue skies
I need them old times i need

Something good yeah something good

Something good yeah something good

Oh oh woah oh oh
No no no no no yes
I need sunshine, I need angels I need
Something good yeah i need blue skies

I need them old times i need
Something good yeah something good,
Something good yeah something good
Oh oh woah oh oh
Something good, something good yeah yeah yeah
No no no no no no no
I need (oh woaah)
I need
I need
I need
