Challenge my own world to chaos
Thoughts to mind becomes my arch enemies
Skin to teeth... visions appears to me in red
Scouring my wounds with your spit
Down in apathy which is growing
Once dragged down within a mayhem of light
Skin to teeth... ripping my inwards apart
Poisoned with wine from the sick
Silent to drowse with the phantoms
and let the fire engulf me

Sanguine rebirth
Sanguine divined rebirth
Now your faces facing me
as transparent masks

I'm pyretic to all heedful dead souls
claiming lands where even angels fear to tread
I am torture disguised
Named by man as a creeping jesus

All heedful souls
All heedful...
Still they pester me
Still they haunt... as placidity is borned
The remembrance... age of innocence lost

Ascend...
Fire dance with me
let me be the most licentious martyr

Sear me
