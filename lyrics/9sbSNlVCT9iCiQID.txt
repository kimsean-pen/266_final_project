The heavens hang heavy on you tonight
But I'm a bit cold, your only hope
The only thing to keep your guts from spilling out

Handsome woman, what you want with me?
You're a deity and I'm nothing but my beliefs
Yeah, they take me there to [?]
Where the heavens are
Where the angels sip champagne
And every fiber remains so alive
We are celestial creatures

What you want with me?
You're a deity and I'm nothing but my beliefs

Oh these are blessed times, wooo hooo
We are celestial creatures, oooh

Every fiber remains so alive
Oh these are blessed times, wooo hooo
