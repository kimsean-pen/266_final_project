I was thinking maybe you should come with me
You just play your song and I'll accompany
I'll bring you the greatest things in life, all free
So I invested my money in your company
Like where you wanna go, girl, I'll take you there
Let me put another flower in your hair
When I'm with you I can't even have a care
Take all of my soul, I'm not afraid to share

Woah oh oh
I love your soul (Oh I love your, oo I really love your)
Oh oh oh
I love your soul
Mmm
Woah oh oh
I love your soul (Oh I love your, oo I really love your)
Oh oh oh
I love your soul (your soul)
Mmm

You're always perfectly perfect
We got like product de purchase
Low like the breezing these verses
Put all the men in these hearses
I love just watching you work it
Splash on the beat and in surface
Bring it to life and then murk it
It has me losing my circuits
The way you move it
Everybody stopping what they doing
Just to see the way they to be grooving
I've made up my mind there is no choosing
Choosing

Woah oh oh
I love your soul (Oh I love your, oo I really love your)
Oh oh oh
I love your soul
Mmm
Woah oh oh
I love your soul (Oh I love your, oo I really love your)
Oh oh oh
I love your soul (your soul)
Mmm
Aye, little bit o' sunshine in my life
A little bit o' reggae for my ride
A little bit o' color for my feed
A little bit o' summer, what I need
A little bit o' pass out in the sun
A little bit o' stay up after one
A little bit o' movement, that's the flame
A little bit o' hold up, that's my jam, aye
