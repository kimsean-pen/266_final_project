Baby you, you got what I need
Baby you, you got my sunshine
Baby you, you got what I need
Baby you, you got my sunshine

When I see you it's a beautiful world
But when you're gone, I want you in my arms
I'm telling you the last time

Baby you, you got what I need
Baby you, you got my sunshine

Every night I notice you're all alone
Wonder you might
Let me love you I'm on fire
Can't you feel my desire
I want to take you higher

It's a simplest thing,
Always so hard to see
I want to be
The one and only making you feel love
Oh darling I need love
It's all I can dream of

Baby you, you got what I need
Baby you, you got my sunshine
Baby you, you got what I need
Baby you, you got my sunshine

You got my sunshine
