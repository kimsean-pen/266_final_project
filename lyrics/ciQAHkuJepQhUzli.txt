Seemed to stop my breath
My head on your chest waitinig to cave in
From the bottom of my
Hear your voice again
Could we dim the sun and wonder where we've been
May be you and me, so kiss me like you did
My heart stopped beating such a softer sin
(I'm melting, I'm melting)

In your eyes I lost my place
Could stay a while and I'm melting
In your eyes like my first time
That I caught fire
Just stay with me, lay with me now

Never caught my breath
Every second I'm without you, I'm a mess
Ever know each other
Trust these words are stones
Why cuts aren't healing
Learning how to love
I'm melting (I'm melting)

In your eyes I lost my place
Could stay a while and I'm melting
In your eyes like my first time
That I caught fire
Just stay with me, lay with me
(Stay with me, lay with me now)

You can stay and watch me fall
And of course I'll ask for help
To stay with me now
We could take our heads off
Stay in bed just make love thats all
Just stay with me now
I'm melting (I'm melting)

In your eyes I lost my place
Could stay a while and I'm melting
In your eyes like my first time
That I caught fire
Just stay with me, lay with me

In your eyes I lost my place
Could stay a while and I'm melting
In your eyes like my first time
That I caught fire
Just stay with me, lay with me
(Stay with me, lay with me)

In your eyes
Let's sleep till the sun burns out
I'm melting in your eyes (I'm melting)
In your eyes
Let's sleep till the sun burns out
I'm melting in your eyes
