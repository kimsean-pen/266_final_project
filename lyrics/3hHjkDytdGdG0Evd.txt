Music is the key to fall in love
Music is the answer of the world
Music is the power to survive
When I fell down

Even if I'm wasting all my time
Trying to get your face all out of my mind
The summer takes you back into my heart
Into my soul

Remember the time when we were spending afternoons
Making love we used to fly on the sun
Recall the days, we broke the rules, we jumped the wall
You know that I would never lose your love

I'm feeling like a dandy around the world
Open my heart and keep on trying to find your love
I, I can't see this passion drift apart
I thought that I would never miss your love

The summer is crazy ah, ah, la, la, la, la
The summer is crazy ah, ah, la, la, la, la
The summer is crazy tonight
The summer is crazy tonight
The summer is crazy tonight, la, la, la, la

I keep on thinking how you did me wrong
My love was true and I would never let it go
I need to find the way to save my heart
'Cause I know that I will never have your love

The summer is crazy ah ah, la, la, la, la
The summer is crazy ah ah, la, la, la, la
The summer is crazy tonight
The summer is crazy tonight
The summer is crazy tonight, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, tonight, la, la, la, la

The summer is crazy ah ah, la, la, la, la
The summer is crazy ah ah, la, la, la, la
The summer is crazy tonight
The summer is crazy tonight
The summer is crazy tonight, la, la, la, la
The summer is crazy
