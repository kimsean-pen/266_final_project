You've got the pleasure
to live inside my words
and I've got desire
to bury all the words I've heard
A chain reaction
brought you on my land
when you spoke of action yeah
words becoming weapons pushed into my hands
and though I cried
when you burned me with the sun
but I'll never take it back again
poison that I've overcome
You won't get out here alive
trapped inside till you die
you belong to me
she'll never set you free
eternally
but don't believe
and though I tried
I'm better off alone
and you'll never make it back again
Voices are guiding me home
You won't get out here alive
trapped inside till you die
you belong to me
she'll never set you free
eternally
she'll never set you free
eternally
but don't believe
