Bet you think that I don't love you, baby
Bet you think that I...
I don't care
But I wanna tell you
Well, you got something
And I'm loving you with all my heart
I don't ever wanna part
'Cause I don't wanna be with nobody but you
No no
I don't wanna be with no-one but you
I wanna to be wrapped up
in the arms of my loving man
(Come on and rock me)
Rock me in your arms like I know you can
Don't you know that you can call on me, baby
(You can call on me)
All you gotta do is say you will
(All you gotta do)
'Cause I'm ready just to love you
And put an end to all your doubts
I know we can work it out
'Cause I don't wanna be with nobody but you
No no
I don't wanna be with no-one but you
I wanna to be wrapped up
in the arms of my loving man
(Come on and rock me)
Rock me in your arms like I know you can
Man, I love you
So, put an end to your fantasy,
or you just might...
You just might blow it all
Get yourself together
and baby, when you do
You're gonna see that I'll be true to you
'Cause I don't wanna be with nobody but you
No no
I don't wanna be with no-one but you
I wanna to be wrapped up
in the arms of my loving man
(Come on and rock me)
Rock me in your arms like I know you can
(You can call on me)
(Yes, yes)
(You can call on me)
(Yes, yes)
(Come on and rock me)
Don't you know that you can call on me, baby
(You can call on me)
All you gotta do is say you will
(Say)
'Cause I'm ready just to love you
(I'm ready)
And put an end to all your doubts
I know we can work it out
'Cause I don't wanna be with nobody but you
No no
I don't wanna be with no-one, baby
I wanna to be wrapped up
in the arms of my loving man
(Come on and rock me)
Rock me in your arms like I know you can
(Come on and rock me)
Rock me in your arms like I know you can
(Come on and rock me)
Rock me in your arms like I know you can
