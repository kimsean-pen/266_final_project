I wanna be a dog
I wanna lay around all day
Don't wanna be part of the stupid games that people play
I wanna be a dog
Throw all my cares away
Cant wait for you to get back home, so that we can play
I wanna be a dog
A dog
I wanna be a dog
You can teach me how to beg
I'll lick my balls and then when you get home, I'll hump your leg
I wanna be a dog
Just don't be cruel to me
Don't wanna be in one of those commercials on TV
I'll always be right by your side, when I see all the tears you cry
I'll sit next to you at night
Switch my ears out all the time
I wanna be the best fucking friend you've ever had
Cuz your so rad
I wanna be a dog
I wanna be a dog
I wanna be a dog
I wanna be a dog
