The sun came up
The world began to shake
Fault lines exposing
All my own mistakes

If I could do anything
Then this wouldn't be happening
It's been a long time
Since I've felt courageous

Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up
Walking in my sleep never to awaken
Be love, be love, be love, be love
Look alive

Should watch what I say
There's power in my refrains
Most of these days
Been pumping on the brakes

If we could do anything
Then this wouldn't be happening
If we're strong for once
It could get contagious

Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up
Walking in my sleep never to awaken
Be love, be love, be love, be love
Look alive

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Dancing in the dark with old hallucinations
Be love, be love, be love, be love
Look alive

The hero enters the frame
He's memorized his lines
And hollow words from the front of the stage
Echo for miles and miles and miles and miles

Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up
Walking in my sleep never to awaken
Be love, be love, be love, be love
Look alive

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Dancing in the dark with old hallucinations
Be love, be love, be love, be love
Look alive
