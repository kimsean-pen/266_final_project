Hoochie-coo-mon-ami-oh-my
Honey, honey
Honey, honey

Go on get your little bit on the side
Honey, honey
Honey, honey

She'll only love you 'til the money runs dry
Honey, honey
Honey, honey

So go on get your little bit on the side
Honey, honey
Honey, honey

You've made your bed now lie in it
You know that I'd agree
This feeling it ain't right
I can't deny it
But what use is there to fight?

And if you've still got love for me
You'd better recognise it
And if you've hid that demon deep
You'd better exorcise it.
