I know you play with shallow lies
Your costumes are just a fur in disguise
We know your games your serial crimes
You take a woman by the neck to die

Your evil face will soon be mine
I know your feet are walking towards my eyes
I know the place where you reside
It's near the factory where you work at night

I'm not afraid of what you'll do
I've seen so many persons worse than you
You think you're brave, you think you're right
But you should know that you will die tonight
