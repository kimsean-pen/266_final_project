In the flinty light, it's midnight and stars collide
Shadows run, in full flight, to run, seek and hide
Well, I'm still not sure what part I play
In this shadow play, this shadow play

In the half light, on this mad night
I hear a voice in time
Well, I look back, see a half-smile
Then it's gone from sight

Won't you tell me how I can find my way?
In this shadow play, this shadow play
In this shadow play, this shadow play

Sounds come crashing and I hear laughing
All those lights just blaze away
I feel a little strange inside
A little bit of Jekyll, a little Mr. Hyde

Sounds come crashing and I hear laughing?
All those lights just blaze away
I feel a little strange inside
A little Mr. Jekyll, a little Mr. Hyde

Thoughts run wild, free as a child, into the night
Across the screen a thin beam, of magic light
Yeah, things they just don't look the same
In this shadow play, this shadow play

Shadow play, shadow play
I can't run away from this shadow play
Shadow play, this shadow play
