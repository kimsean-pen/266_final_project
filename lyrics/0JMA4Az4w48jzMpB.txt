Why do I gotta learn the hard way?
Why do I gotta burn my bridges down?
Now that I feel so numb
Can't I just be me for fuck's sake?

Maybe I don't have a purpose
Maybe I cut way too deep
Or maybe I scratched the surface
And find out that I'm not worthless

And I have never been so alive

I feel a fire burning underneath my skin
Now that I'm breathin', I'll breathe you in
I feel a freedom from this hopelessness within
Now that I'm breathin', I'll breathe you in

I should have stopped when I saw you break in
I should have stopped but I had to see it through
Now that I've come undone
I know why I've been forsaken

Maybe I'm too weak to hold you
Maybe I'm just out of range
So sorry I suffocate you
It must feel like I hate you

But I have never been so alone

I feel a fire burning underneath my skin
Now that I'm breathin', I'll breathe you in
I feel a freedom from this hopelessness within
Now that I'm breathin', I'll breathe you in

I been afraid to show you what I'm made of
And all of this time, what was I so afraid of?
You never did anything to make me feel this way
To make me feel this way

I feel a fire burning underneath my skin
Now that I'm breathin', I'll breathe you in
I feel a freedom from this hopelessness within
Now that I'm breathin', I'll breathe you in

I'll breathe you in
I'll breathe you in
