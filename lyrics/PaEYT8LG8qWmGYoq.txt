"Listen to them, children of the night, what music they make..."

Paint your face, tonight we terrorize this town
Coffin case, we gather, our time is now
10.31 we roam the streets in thirst for blood
It all begins all begins with you, with your life

10.31 we roam the streets in thirst for blood
Sleep all day party all night, never grow old never die
It's fun to be a vampire

We are (we are) the children of the night
And we are rising from the grave
To haunt you in your sleep and drink you from your neck

Cry little sister and save these, save these lost boys, thou shall not fall
Be one of us.
Cry little sister and save these, and save these lost boys, thou shall not fall
we can't fall

Be one of us.
We are, (we are) the children of the night
And we are rising from the grave
To haunt you in your sleep and drink you, from your neck
We are, (we are) the children of the night
And we, are rising from the grave, (from the grave)
To haunt you (to haunt you) in your sleep and drink you from your neck.
