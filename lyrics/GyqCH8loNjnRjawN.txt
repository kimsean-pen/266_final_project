All I want in life is to be happy, happy
All I want in life is to be happy, happy
All I want in life is to be happy, happy
All I want in life is to be happy, happy

It seems funny to me, (All I want in life is to be happy)
(All I want in life is to be happy, happy)
How fucked things can be, (All I want in life is to be happy, happy)
(All I want in life is to be happy, happy)
Every time I get ahead, (All I want in life is to be happy, happy)
(All I want in life is to be happy, happy)
I feel more dead, (All I want in life is to be happy, happy)
(All I want in life is to be happy, happy)
