Now that I'm thinking sober
Don't you try to get no closer
I'm just gonna get in my car and drive, and drive
Looking in the rearview mirror
Everything is so much clearer
Watch me wave it all goodbye, goodbye

The light's flashing, giving me all the danger signs
Someone to save, to save
But it don't work that way

Think you made your greatest mistake
I'm not gonna call this a break
Think you really blew it this time
Think you could walk on such a thin line
Won't be taking your midnight calls
Ignore the rocks you throw at my wall
I see it written on your face
You know you made it, your greatest mistake

When the last straw is broken
When the last door is closing
I ain't that dumb to stick around, stick around
I ain't got the time for looking back
Gonna let yourself slip through the cracks
And you just keep going down, down, down

I'mma stay undercover
Lay low for some time
No one to save, to save
This sick cycle's over, baby

Think you made your greatest mistake
I'm not gonna call this a break
Think you really blew it this time
Think you could walk on such a thin line
Won't be taking your midnight calls
Ignore the rocks you throw at my wall
I see it written on your face
You know you made it, your greatest mistake

Why you lookin at me, spitting that same old lie
Trying to bring back, ain't no flipping my mind
Don't you get it by now the story's over, over?
Still calling my name outside my house
I'm hitting the switch
Watch the lights go out
Watch the lights go out

I hope you ache, ache, ache oh, oh
I hope you ache, ache, ache oh, oh

Think you made your greatest mistake
I'm not gonna call this a break
Think you really blew it this time
Think you could walk on such a thin line
Won't be taking your midnight calls
Ignore the rocks you throw at my wall
I see it written on your face
You know you made it, your greatest mistake
