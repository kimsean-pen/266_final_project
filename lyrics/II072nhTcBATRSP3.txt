On the way home, this car hears my confessions.
I think tonight I'll take the long way.
In this weather, the wind outside is biting.
It's left me feeling tired and exposed.
You've been asking me to bleed.
It seems these kinds of questions, they come too easy to you now.
And your lack of shame comes naturally.
I should not be surprised. I should have seen it sooner.

Expect me to apologize for things that you've done wrong.
But you're inciting others.
You're owning up to nothing and I wish that I was gone,
'cause you're not going anywhere.

And this damp air it's fighting my defroster.
My sighs they ring victorious and fog this tinted glass.
And it's clouded and so is my head.
The hint of these new tears are sharp I try to choke them back.
But it's useless. I am useless against them.
They are beating me with ease.

On the way home this car hears my confessions.
I think tonight I'll take the long way.

Expect me to apologize for things that you've done wrong.
While you're inciting others.
You're owning up to nothing and I wish that I was gone,
'Cause you're not going anywhere.

On the way home this car hears my confessions.
I think tonight I'll take the long way.
