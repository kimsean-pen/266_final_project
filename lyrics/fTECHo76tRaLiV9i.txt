When you wake
I be losing sleep
A mother crying on the TV
The world is sufferin'

I had enough
I need your innocence
Don't let up
Just give me your love
Give me your release
I need the healing of your touch
I can take it, I can take the pain

It's all for you, for you, for you
It's always been for you
It's all for you, for you, for you
It's always been for you

You were quiet
In a world so full of noise
I'll be the shoulder you cry on
I will always hear your voice
A full of desire
Your love, your life, your dream
I'll give you healing with my touch
I can take it, I can take all the pain

It's all for you, for you, for you
It's always been for you
It's all for you, for you, for you
It's always been for you

Our love will never fade
In the story that we read on
Forever in the twilight
Like a diamond in the calm

You're the moon
On a cold grace eve
You light the way
Always guiding me

It's all for you, for you, for you
It's always been for you
It's all for you, for you, for you
It's always been for you
It's all for you, for you, for you
It's always been for you
It's all for you, for you, for you
It's always been for you
