All these days have turned these months into a year
And I've been spending every second wishing I could disappear
And I know when they all start to speak again
I just need some inspiration I can rightfully defend
And I'm close when it's hurting bad, it only gets worse
I sing for the children of the earth

I've broken every rule that I've known
Since you told me that I've got to have passion
Honestly, you've got me all wrong
I am just a boy on my own, and looking for some promising action
Tell me what it takes to move on

When I'm gone I can't keep up with what's at home
And I'd love to make it right, but there are things I can't control
But I'm close, when it's over tell me when to let go
I'll be the last one to know

When you were at the top of my list, I promised you
That this wouldn't happen, how do I begin to explain
Crimson lips and permanent kiss, you love me
On the back of a napkin, maybe I should throw it away

Make a move, so carefully,
Cut me down and let me bleed
And I'll slowly, walk away

And now you wanna talk, so fitting
I remember times, when you were holding by a thread of a chance
You'll make it out alive, God willing
All you need is time,
And it's been getting awful close to our year
This is so messed up, but if you give me all your love
Then we'll show angels up above, that we can
Make it out alive, God willing
I remember times, when you were holding by a thread of a chance

I've broken all the rule that I've known
You told me that I've got to have passion
Honestly, you've got me all wrong
I am just a boy on my own,
And looking for some promising action
Tell me what it takes to move on

Make a move, so carefully,
Get me down and let me bleed
And I'll slowly walk away
