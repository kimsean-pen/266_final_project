Ballads are being sung
But not for me
Church bells are being rung
But not for me

I've never known love
Or been shown love, you see
Maybe there is such a thing
But it's not for me

Poems are being read
But not for me
Prayers are being said
But not for me

I am without love
But I don't doubt love can be
Warm and tender for some
But not for me

Let all of your singers be singing
But not for me
Let all of your church bells be ringing
But not for me

Let all of your singers be singing
But not for me
Let all of your church bells be ringing
But not for me
