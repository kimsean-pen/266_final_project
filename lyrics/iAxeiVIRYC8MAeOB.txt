Execute the Queen
Bury her body at sea

Where she can't hurt our friends again
A just and fitting end
Now we must carry on (on down this road)
And sing another carrying song (our heavy load)
Well, I found one inside my heart
When it was blown apart

The future just got here, again and again now
The present was awful, but it's all past now

The future just got here, again and again now
The present was awful, but it's all past now

Let it float away
Go dancing on its grave

There's a place for you
The world has just been lying
But I know it's true
So just hold on
Until the phantom's gone

The future just got here, again and again now
The present was awful, but it's all past now

The future just got here, again and again now
The present was awful, but it's all past now, it's all past now

The future just got here, again and again now
The present was awful, but it's all past now

The future just got here, again and again now
The present was awful, but it's all past now
