Sybilla looked into her mirror
Priscilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sybilla looked into the wardrobe
Priscilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes
Just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines
Just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery
Just to be free again
Priscilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister
