If I had one wish it'd be for you
And all your friends that didn't like me
If I had one wish it'd be that we had danced more
At that apocryphal wedding

If I sound angry, I'm sorry
This body can only cry for so long
And if you want to blame me then go on
I'm smiling now 'cause I'm smarter than you think

I'm smarter than you
I'm smarter than you think

I apologize for not telling you
That my halo was cut from paper
Sliced from the fibers that made up all the parts
That we were together

Even though I miss you, I'm thankful
It's obvious that this war was futile
So put your hands together and clap
For the painful choice you've made 'cause it's right

I'm smarter than you
I'm smarter than you think
I'm smarter than you
I'm smarter than you think

You are the narcissist, you're everything you saw in me
(Into the sea you fell in love with the reflection of yourself)
You are the narcissist, you're everything you saw in me
(I felt the ocean's grip, I swam away to watch you drift)
(You failed to see I'm smarter than you think)
(I'm smarter than you think)

I'm smarter than you
I'm smarter than you think
I'm smarter than you
I'm smarter than you think

(I found out)
I'm smarter than you
(The hard way this time)
I'm smarter than you think

(We were right)
I'm smarter than you
(This was all wrong)
I'm smarter than you think
