I ain't changing my ways
lo siento
I don't give a what they say
lo siento
Even when im away
You know i come back and stay, stay
Lo siento
They know I'm an aventura
De nada
They say nobody's true ah
De nada
No Nobody can blame us
De nada
They made the hit famous

Shove it up your...

Everybody stare
Everybody stare
Extraordinaire
Extraordinaire
How we go nowhere?
How we go nowhere?
But we're just going slow
Didn't you know that?

Uh, you're a little bit too late
Mad, got my way
Su casa, mi casa i say
mi casa, su casa no way

I don't fuck with your city,
hate the vibe
Lo siento
I only make music with my guys
Those beats, don't even try
Because of Spanish i had to do the tenth grade twice

They know im an aventura
De nada
They say nobody's true ah
De nada
No, nobody can blame us
De nada

They made the hit famous

Everybody stare

How we go nowhere?

But we're just going slow
Didn't you know that?

Ah, you're a little bit to late
Mad, i got my way

mi casa, su casa no way
