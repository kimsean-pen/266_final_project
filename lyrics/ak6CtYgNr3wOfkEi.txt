Gemini, you were his majesty, daddy's little girl.
Sugar on the lips, our laughter in the dark. Always wanted better than this.
Shining so bright, plummeting to earth. Oblong orbit set to collide. Sold to fashion.
Stargazer your head full of sky,
You were not ready for it, you were not ready-eddie.
Stargazer our eyes burning, wide.
We were not ready for it, we were not ready-eddie. We were not ready for goodbye.
Twinkling like the morning moon. Beaming, luminous.
Took too much to stay, flew too high to fall. Always wanted better than this.
Shining so bright. Plummeting to earth. Oblong orbit set to collide. Sold to fashion.
Stargazer your head full of sky.
You were not ready for it, you were not ready-eddie.
Stargazer our eyes burning, wide.
We were not ready for it, we were not ready-eddie. We were not ready for goodbye.
Goodbye...
Hurtle toward the sun.
Fearless like a runaway.
Wax-wing gambler, born to burn, yeah.
Stargazer your head full of sky.
You were not ready for it, you were not ready-eddie.
Stargazer our eyes burning, wide.
We were not ready, we were not ready, we were not ready for goodbye.
Goodbye.
