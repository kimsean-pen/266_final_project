Hotel Home
You're never on your own
All the seeds we've sown
All the chances that we've blown
Our knives are never dull
Our moon is always full
I could have gone the other way
But now I'm here and I want to stay

I'm never too far like the stars all are
I'm never too nigh, I'm a satellite
The world will find me when the time is ripe
I'm never at home so call on Skype

Lead-blue hearts in the cities of steal
I don't care if nothing of this was ever real
The promises she breaks
when fate makes mistakes
What would have been nobody knows,
but that's the way the story goes

Hotel Home, you're never on your own
All the seeds we've sown,
all the chances that we've blown
