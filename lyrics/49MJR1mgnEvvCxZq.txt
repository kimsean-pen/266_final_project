You took me under sure
Never done growing up, no
My smile is so rarely there, no
I call you my precious like
Asking me where we go from here, now
No, we ain't feeling the damn time, passing
No we ain't feeling the damn time, no

You, give me faith to care
Angel spreading love
You shine, and you can't prevent it
Ball of light coming from above
Have no clue where we go from here
From here, from here, from here
No we ain't feeling the damn time
(listen)
No we ain't feeling the damn time, no

You, took me under, sure
Never done growing up, no
My smile is so rare, but there no
I call you my precious like
Asking me where we go from here, now
No, we ain't feeling the damn time, passing
No we ain't feeling the damn time, no

You, give me faith to care
An angel spreading love
You shine, and you can't prevent it
Ball of light coming from above
Have no clue where we go from here
From here, from here, from here
And we ain't feeling the damn time
(listen)
And we ain't feeling the damn time
