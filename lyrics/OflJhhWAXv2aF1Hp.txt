Oh oh yeah ooh

We text as we eat
As we listen to the freaks
As we wait for the right of way
We text as we talk
We're running as we walk
'Cause we're several little souls away
We smoke as we choke
As we sink another Coke
And we grin when it blows our minds
We skate as we date
As we slowly suffocate
We're running, we're running, we're running
Out of time

-Chorus-
My life got cold
It happened many years ago
When summer slipped away
So chill now whoah
We've got many years to go
So take it day by day

And long ago
I lost my soul
To some forgotten dream
How was I supposed to know
It wasn't what it seemed
And even though the last hello
Has left me on the floor
I don't believe in Romeos or heroes anymore

We spend as we mend
'Cause we're happy to pretend
Everything's gonna be OK
We shake as we break
Never giving 'til we take
And we hate when we have to pay
We flirt while we work
To forget about the hurt
And the trash that we left behind
We sink as we swim
The ice is wearing thin
We're running, we're running, we're running
Out of time

-chorus-
My life got cold
It happened many years ago
When summer slipped away
So chill now whoah
We've got many years to go
So take it day by day

And long ago
I lost my soul
To some forgotten dream and
How was I supposed to know
It wasn't what it seemed
And even though the last hello
Has left me on the floor
I don't believe in Romeos or heroes anymore

-chorus-
My life got cold
It happened many years ago
When summer slipped away
So chill now whoah
We've got many years to go
So take it day by day

And long ago
I lost my soul
To some forgotten dream and
How was I supposed to know
It wasn't what it seemed
And even though the last hello
Has left me on the floor
I don't believe in Romeos or heroes anymore
