I saw a savior
A savior come my way
I thought I'd see it
In the cold light of day
But now I realize that I'm
Only for me

If only I could see
Return myself to me
And recognize the poison in my heart
There is no other place
No one else I face
The remedy will agree with how I feel

Here in my reflecting
What more can I say?
For I am guilty
for the voice that I obey
Too scared to sacrifice a choice
Chosen for me

If only I could see
Return myself to me
And recognize the poison in my heart
There is no other place
No one else I face
The remedy will agree with how i feel
