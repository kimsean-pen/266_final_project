Strength beyond strength
I have seen pain beyond pain
Unbreakable

No purpose for anything
Living life just to live and waste away
In my mind I feel I am lifeless
Left behind this life spineless
I'll raise my fist to find the power
Through isolation I'll find the answer

You use my name for the fortune and fame
I'll continue to fight when no one knows my name

All this power I've been given
Swear to god it's like a curse
Anybody run up no effort to put them in a hearse
One touch, no challenge
Need a patch, no balance
No match, only malice
I need purpose always searchin'
I got blood in my vision, unstoppable killin' 'em
Call me abominable, there is no option
Dead when they're walkin'
Don't have a heart and I am the enemy rip you apart
I'll die a king but part of me
Just wishes all my fallen dreams would come to life
Succumb to strife, don't care to pray just let me waste away

No purpose for anything
Sacrificed everything to slay away
In my mind I feel I am lifeless
With this strength life feels pointless
The threat of death, has lost its power
Carnage will cease to exist forever

Strength beyond strength
I have seen pain beyond pain
Unbreakable
Strength beyond strength
I have seen pain beyond pain
Unbreakable
