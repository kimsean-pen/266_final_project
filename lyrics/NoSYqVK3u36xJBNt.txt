I behave like I'm so social
I've seen it all before
Take me away right now
'Bout I save yourself

Someday I'll be old and out of touch
Will I miss too much?
Did I beat the rush by default
I've always cared a bit too much
Did I make the cut?
I said I'm thinking but I'm just stalling

Then I get that calling
And I behave like I'm so social
I've seen it all before
Take me away right now
'Bout I save yourself
From the so social
I'm sleeping on the floor
If you can hear this now
'Bout I save yourself

Oh you play up to something
Oh you play up to something more
I must be playing for something

Somedays I feel colder to the touch
Who am I to judge?
Must've missed the crutch by default
My thoughts will never be enough
Can we get in touch?
I said I'm busy but I'm just stalling

Then I get that calling
And I behave like I'm so social
I've seen it all before
Take me away right now
'Bout I save yourself
From the so social
I'm sleeping on the floor
If you can hear this now
'Bout I save yourself

Oh you play up to something
Oh you play up to something more
I must be playing for something

Social
Social
Sorry, so social

I behave like I'm so social
Got nothing to show for
Me standing here right now
'Bout I save yourself
From the so social
Can't fake it anymore
If you can hear this now
'Bout I save yourself

Oh you play up to something
Oh you play up to something more
I must be playing for something
