War!

Nuclear warheads cry out for destruction
Insanity and corruption of the Universe
Concentration camps are back again
Third Reich is here between us

Total slaughter is the only rule
Kill to live, live to kill
Mass extermination, black death
The corrosion of the world is done

War!

The radiation corroses our faces
Over mutilated corpses we have to march
Destructed empires, where is God now?
That calls himself the redeemer of the mankind

Infernal visions torment our minds
Pools of blood spreaded through the world
Christians cry in torment
Asking for help to their redeemer

War!

The black sunset breaks out the silence
The last scream of pain is heard
Death burns its victims
Sending their souls to Hell

Feel the blade in your sacrifice
Now is the time to abjure Jesus Christ
The black war comes with the wind
There is neither Heaven nor Hell, but only war!

Massacring who won
Mutilating the fools
The black death empire
Exterminating without mercy

War!

War!
