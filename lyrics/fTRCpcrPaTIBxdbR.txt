Why stress, why drama?
Stop acting like you uninvited
If you ain't, I'm gonna
Don't need to ask permission, I do it my way
Time is precious, so don't you waste your breath on me
Nah, don't waste your breath on me
Don't go waste your energy

All this talk about money
Lie awake, got me dizzy
Counting every penny
Want to get out of the city
All this talk about money
Lie awake, got me dizzy
Counting every penny
Want to get out of the city

We're too young for this, we're too young for this
Isn't it obvious?
We're too young for this
We're too young for this, we're too young for this
Isn't it obvious?
We're too young

Our time's not wasted
Let's fade it out, don't think about it
Head straight to the vision, don't mess around
Acting like we're golden
Time is precious, so don't you waste your breath on me
Waste your breath on me
Nah, don't waste your energy

All this talk about money
Lie awake, got me dizzy
Counting every penny
Want to get out of the city
All this talk about money
Lie awake, got me dizzy
Counting every penny
Want to get out of the city

We're too young for this, we're too young for this
Isn't it obvious?
We're too young for this
We're too young for this, we're too young for this
Isn't it obvious?
We're too young

All this talk about money
Lie awake, got me dizzy
Counting every penny
Want to get out of the city
All this talk about money
Lie awake, got me dizzy
Counting every penny
Want to get out of the city

We're too young for this, we're too young for this
Isn't it obvious?
We're too young for this
We're too young for this, we're too young for this
Isn't it obvious?
We're too young
