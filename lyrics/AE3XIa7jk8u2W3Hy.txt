See I try to hide the fact
That I am just a fragile individual
So I give off this facade that I'm so hard
When in fact I'm far from unbreakable

I'm so afraid to talk and express myself
Keepin' all my feelings bottled inside
Of this empty shell that I call my heart
'Cause I can't let love back in again...

Oh, I wish I'd known love was cold before I fell in
'Cause I went head on with its storm
Like lightning going into sand...

Oh, it's better to have loved
Than not to have loved at all
So I guess I should feel fortunate
But I don't feel that way, least not in my heart

'Cause see love has left me broken (broken like glass)
So when you see me you can call me
See me you can call me Misses Glass

Now after all the lying to myself

I'm stuck feeling miserable
When I have forced myself to be somebody else
Making me seem invisible
'Cause see I'm a woman like any other woman

And sometimes I get emotional
And it might seem hard to understand where I'm coming from
And you might never ever know
Oh, I wish I'd known love was cold before I fell in
'Cause I went head on with its storm
Like lightning going into sand
