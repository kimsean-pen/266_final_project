He said: "Saw Red. Went home, stayed in bed all day"
Your T-shirt's dish dirt
Always love the one you hurt

It's a crack. I'm back. Yeah, I'm standing
On the rooftops, shouting out
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops, shout it out

It's a crack. I'm back. Yeah, I'm standing
On the rooftops, having it
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops, shout it out
Shout it out

You sleep too deep. One week is another world
(Big mouth) Big mouth (drop out) drop out
You get what you deserve
You're strange, insane, one thing you can never change

It's a crack. I'm back. Yeah, I'm standing
On the rooftops, shouting out
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops, shout it out

On the rooftops, having it

From the rooftops, shout it out
Shout it out

Ready to go

Abused, confused, always love the one that
Hurt ya, hurt ya, hurt ya, hurt ya

From the rooftops, shout it out
