Thought not to walk alone here
Where all things die
Witness the sameness of will
Where all men cry
Farther and farther away
Into long ago
Soft yellow halo inside
Keeps me alive
My own reflection subsides
When I look to you
Written and noted by none
Fade out into
I drift farther away
Into long ago
Witness your hollowing eyes
Find time to die
Long ago
Fade too slow
Fall to life
Motion go
