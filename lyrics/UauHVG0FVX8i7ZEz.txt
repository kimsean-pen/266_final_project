Falling for the creep the body leech here he comes
Vicious hypnosis, a clenched fist saying it's wrong
to want more than a folk song
underneath the shaker knit he's a brick wall
she keep falling for the trick vegetariate sing-along
give a little kick with your fine thigh high

doo-doo-doo we're on to you
tearing her down, talking her down under your breath
making a mess, see she is happy you wanna break it

doo-doo-doo we're on to you
tearing her down, talking her down under your breath
making a mess, see she is happy you wanna break it

doo-doo-doo we're on to you
your phony roots, borrowed guitar
telling her what to think we are
you the number one wet blanket
hardly a day goes by you don't try to break down
no I don't buy it
you're still around I wonder why
she just keep...

Falling for the creep the body leech here he comes
Vicious hypnosis, a clenched fist saying it's wrong
to want more than a folk song
underneath the shaker knit he's a brick wall
she keep falling for the creep
the body leech coming on
vicious hypnosis, clenched fist saying
it's wrong to want more than a folk song
I'm wrong to want more than a folk song
I'm wrong to want more than a folk song
underneath the shaker knit he's a brick wall
she keep falling for the trick vegetariate sing-along
give a little kick with your fine thigh high

doo-doo-doo

doo-doo-doo we're on to you
tearing her down, talking her down under your breath
making a mess, see she is happy you wanna break it

doo-doo-doo we're on to you
your bathing suit, borrowed guitar
telling her what to think we are
you the number one wet blanket
you're still around I wonder why
you the number one wet blanket

you'll never believe me so why don't you find out for yourself
then you'll see the glass hidden in the grass
bad seeds come and go for which you must allow
sick down to my heart that's just the way it goes
