La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I look at you and I'm all like whatever
I think of you and I'm all like whatever
I dream of you and I'm all like whatever I got to do
Whatever I got to do

Yeah, maybe I think about you sometimes
Yeah, maybe I think you're pretty alright
Yeah, maybe It'd be decent if we linked up
Fuck, am I crazy for dreaming of you all night?
I scroll through every picture that you took, so what?
I picture how our kids would look, so what?
I drew a picture of us in my notebook, so what?
So what I wrote a song about you, let's not go nuts

I look at you and I'm all like whatever
I think of you and I'm all like whatever
I dream of you and I'm all like whatever I got to do
Whatever I got to do

Whatever I gotta do to heal the pain
Whatever I gotta do so you feel the same
I guess I prolly do like all the above if you love me
And each night you call me and we
talk on the phone and be all like whatever
Yeah, it'd be chill to spend all our life together
Whatever, whatever, never mind if it's an effort
I look at you and I'm all like whatever
I think of you and I'm all like whatever
I dream of you and I'm all like whatever I got to do
Whatever I got to do

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Whatever
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Whatever
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Whatever
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I look at you and I'm all like whatever
I think of you and I'm all like whatever
I dream of you and I'm all like whatever I got to do
Whatever I got to do
