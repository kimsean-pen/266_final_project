time in hands, with the pilots and the traveling bands
when you're down there, don't feel down and out
you have something you can smile about
Coke or gin, why are you boys frowning, have you lost something
the solution that you have for me
will invalidate my guarantee

sell something to someone you love
not someone that you don't
even though...

six oh four, Belgian teachers and the cosmonauts
when you're down there, don't feel down and out
you have something you can smile about
holding hands, rocket scientists revise their plans
the solution that they have for me
will burn me up on reentry

sell something to someone you love
not someone that you don't
even though...
