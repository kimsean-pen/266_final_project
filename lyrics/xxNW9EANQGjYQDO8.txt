Chill, light on my sight as my ego becomes
A funky child with some words on my tongue
Be like intake of breath and my mouth gets loose
So while I scatter my spit, I dream of juice
Have you ever made out in dark hallways
Displayed a kiss that made your day or say
Played a track from your record collection
It's your mix, congratulations

We've changed a lot and then some, some
You know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you, you
Then just let me do it now

I bet you light up when we start the show
Follow me now very closely 'cuz I told you so
You know, we glow because we throw sun rays
Yeah we be freaky and we wanna stay

We've changed a lot and then some, some
You know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you, you
Then just let me do it now

Lightning strikes, yo we be in that violent force of light
Guaranteed to turn it out as bad as dolemite
Because we're dope kid, change like a chameleon
And the channel whenever the wack show Real World is on
You know we dazzle like ghetto box boomin' battles
Rattle inside your head feel redeemed like cola bottles
Fall in love with your teachers, on the wax we are self made
Check the technique, 311 in L.A.

We've changed a lot and then some, some
You know that we've always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you, you
Then just let me do it now

Keep my feet on the ground
Keep my head in the clouds
Electrified by the sound
Comes from the down, and
We've changed a lot and then some, some
You know that we've always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you, you
Then just let me do it now
