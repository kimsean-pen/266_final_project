It's the fiend with bout 20 prescriptions
Down for my Triple 6 killers
I glisten in my world of fiction
Twitching from all my addictions
Mutilations deep down in my basement
Forsaken the road to heaven I had taken
Replacing my scriptures for demons and witches
While twisting a cigarillo fulla bitches and snitches
$ U I C I D E
P R O P H E T
Deceased bodies laying in sheets
The blackest creep of the black sheep
Summoned from Hades to rise
3AM when I arrive
6's all over my eyes
Picking my burial site

All of this bullets have names written on them
The trigger I pull it and brains spill no caution
Often I murder I toss em
No washing
Ain't nauseous
I'm flossing inside of the coffin
I reek from the mice I eat
I am the fiend for the shrines and sheets
I am the tide and yes I am the deep
G R E Y F I V E N I N E
I am the skeleton hiding the bones I need
I am the leopard print that Lucifer uses for hide and seek
Enemies try and see me but I'm quite the freak
Hiding inside misery yeah my spine so weak
Frying my memory with all the pine a breathe
Scythe in a sheath
I will slice all the sheep because Christ is on ice
I'm collecting the blood he bleeds
