I want to be a lilikoi, Boy Lilikoi
You grind your claws, you howl, you growl, unafraid of Hoi Polloi
You run, you're free, you climb endless trees, you reignite
You growl, you howl, you show your teeth
You bite, it's all right

Just say no more, use your life, the world goes and flutter by
Use your eyes, you'll know you are
Use your eyes, the world goes and flutter by
Use your eyes, you'll know you are

Wild beam, wild boy, you burn so bright
You illuminate
One day you're out, you give up the fight
You slow down heart-rate

We all grow old, use your life, the world goes and flutter by
Use your life, you'll know you are
Use your life, the world goes and flutter by
Use your life, you'll know you are

Electricity wires are down
Rainbow colours fading to brown
Adventurous smile shifting to frown
Courageous boy, now you're a clown
Your antarctic hair, off with the crown
Your spirited friends, now a ghost town
You run...
You run...

I want to be a lilikoi boy - You
You grind your claws, you howl, you growl, unafraid of Hoi Polloi

Electricity wires are down
Rainbow colours fading to brown
Adventurous smile shifting to frown
Courageous boy, now you're a clown
Your antarctic hair, off with the crown
Your spirited friends, now a ghost town
You run...
You run...
