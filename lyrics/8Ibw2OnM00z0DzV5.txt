First time I came to Babylon
I felt so lonely
I felt so lonely and people came along
To mistreat me
Calling me so many names in the streets
And I was so shy
That I began to cry

But now
I am so proud
Of whatever should be
Cause I have a silver knife
And my lover is Satan? s wife
And I don? t care
If you don? t dare see
