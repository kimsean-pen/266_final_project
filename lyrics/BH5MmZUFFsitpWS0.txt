Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

You know I party with savages
In the club and I rass up the cannabis
Rass and rass and rass 'em

I think I lost my mind, I can't find that shit
I'm reckless in this life I live
I don't think sometimes
I don't even know why, baby I just live my life
I just do what I wanna, when I wanna, how I wanna
Baby gyal I just do what I wanna, when I wanna, how I wanna
I just do what I wanna, when I wanna, how I wanna

I like to kiss and cuddle and what?
Still a baddaman pon da baddaman block
Big ass jacket in the Y, don't ask why
Pass me the keys let me drive
Cah you've been smoking too much skunk
Plus I drive better when I'm drunk
I treat the car like a go-kart
Wouldn't-a bust that red light if I was sober
I don't respect my olders
I do what I want you can't tell me no
I said I'm gonna be a star girl I told you so
Don't be that guy that owes me dough
Send my 'ooter down there with the chrome-y chrome
She's like "when are you free?"
Never bitch I cost, if you drop out me
That's your loss, I switch countries like I switch socks
Pull up, pull up when I drop that gloss

I think I lost my mind, I can't find that shit
I'm reckless in this life I live
I don't think sometimes
I don't even know why, baby I just live my life
I just do what I wanna, when I wanna, how I wanna
Baby gyal I just do what I wanna, when I wanna, how I wanna
I just do what I wanna, when I wanna, how I wanna

I saw this gyal at the zebra crossing
Black and white gyal man it just feel like a zebra cross
She said "can I get a lift?"
My girl with the lisp, said can I get a kiss
Indian gyal said I'm a bloody ghost
'Cause all I do is hola then I adi√≥s
Hit the Caribbean store for some curry goat
She said my meat taste good so she sucked the bone
I'm with a white girl, dancing with some stamina
She a wine to bashment while I'm grabbing her
She movin' like she got some black in her
That was before I put my black in her
I'm living so single and free
I sit comfy, knowing no-one's cheating on me
My gyal even put her arms around me
She so comfy, she even fart around me

I think I lost my mind, I can't find that shit
I'm reckless in this life I live
I don't think sometimes
I don't even know why, baby I just live my life
I just do what I wanna, when I wanna, how I wanna
Baby gyal I just do what I wanna, when I wanna, how I wanna
I just do what I wanna, when I wanna, how I wanna

I could pull up in the car if I want to (I just do it, do it)
Car if I want to (I just do it, do it)
Take a girl yard if I want to (I just do it, do it)
Go hard if I want to (I just do it, do it)
I'm a hustler, I thought you knew that
I could sell a Biggie Smalls album to 2Pac
I'm a hustler, I thought you knew that
I could sell a Biggie Smalls album to 2Pac

I just do what I wanna, when I wanna, how I wanna

I just do what I wanna, when I wanna, how I wanna
