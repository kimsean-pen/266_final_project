Take me away, take me away
You said that you were gonna stay
But you're always lying anyway
You're gonna suffer if you don't start breathing now
Now that I need you, you're goin' away

Everyday, sinking into quicksand
Follow me down the drain

But it doesn't matter anyway
You're gonna get yours any day
And while you put the blame on me
If you could only see yourself as others see
Now that I need you, you're goin' insane

Everyday, sinking into quicksand
Follow me down the drain
Everyday, drinking in the same bar
Drowning my sorrows away

Take me away, take me today
Or I'm never gonna get away
But it makes no difference to me
It's just the sound of one more rock star bleedin' out
Now that I need you, you're out of the frame

Day by day, sinking into quicksand
Follow me down the drain
Everyday, drinking in the same bar
Made mine the same again
