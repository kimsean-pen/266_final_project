Well, well, she's taught to grin
So I sit around, she said
She said it feels so good
That you drive me off the bed
She'll be better off dead
Hey, hey, hey
Well, alright
Her mother came in
She was sipping her drink, she said
Keep your hands off my daughter
You'll be better off dead
The girl's only thirteen
She's never given head
You better keep your hands off her
Your hands will turn red
She'll be better off dead
Hey, hey, hey
Well, Alright
Dead, dead, dead
(She'll be better off dead)
Dead, dead, dead
(She'll be better off dead)
Dead, dead, dead
(She'll be better off dead)
Dead, dead, dead
(She'll be better off dead)
Dead, dead, dead
(She'll be better off dead)
Dead, dead, dead
(She'll be better off dead)
