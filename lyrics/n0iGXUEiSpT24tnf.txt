Talking
Why's everyone always talking?
Noise in my head
But it's nonsense
I can't feel love

Guarded
Don't overthink how we started
Knew from the second you walked in
This could be something

Everybody's looking for love
To start a riot
But every time I look in your eyes
The world gets quiet

So let it go
Let it fall
Let it fly
We'll keep on trying
'Cause I knew I was in love with you
When we sat in silence

Dreaming
I'm wide awake while I'm dreaming
Seeing in your eyes what you're thinking
So please don't worry

Waiting
Know that I'll always be waiting
Do you believe what I'm saying?
I'm in no hurry

Everybody's looking for love to start a riot
But every time I look in your eyes
The world gets quiet

So let it go
Let it fall
Let it fly
We'll keep on trying

'Cause I knew I was in love with you
When we sat in silence

Sat in silence
Sat in silence
Sat in silence
When we sat in silence

Sat in silence
Sat in silence
Sat in silence
When we sat in silence

'Cause I knew I was in love with you
When we sat in silence
