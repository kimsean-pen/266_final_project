We always say that we'll keep in touch
Nobody does, but it don't matter much
One last call at the corner store
The night's on ice if we don't score

One more time for second chances
We just wanna do some damage

So long, so nice2knoU, nice2knoU
I'm sorry to say
We can't go back to yesterday
This night is far from over, far from over
Let's get carried away
We can't go back to yesterday

Call out the names that you used to know
Singing along like a broken stereo
Crossfire that you can't ignore
I know I'm not around much anymore
Anymore

One more time for second chances
We just wanna do some damage

So long, so nice2knoU, nice2knoU
I'm sorry to say
We can't go back to yesterday
This night is far from over, far from over
Let's get carried away
We can't go back to yesterday

One last time for old times' sake
One more bend before we break

One more time as if we planned it
We just wanna do some damage

So long, so nice2knoU, nice2knoU
I'm sorry to say
We can't go back to yesterday
This night is far from over, far from over
Let's get carried away
We can't go back to yesterday

One last time for old times' sake
One more bend before we break
