I wanna take you out
'Cause anytime is right time to
Spend all my money on you
So what you wanna do?

I'm gonna do ya right
I'm working part
Time is on our side
So wake up and put on your shoes
I wanna take you out
Take you out

I'm working so hard out, playing
But God is on our side
I think it's gonna be fine
So let's just give it a try

Walking through the street tops, feeling
The sunset's falling down
Picking it up with our hands
So won't you take me out?
Take me out
