I come down like a hurricane sucked up inside
Now I spit out the suffer, yeah
You said you want a revelation
Revel in this, my lover
You're free at liberty
Is this what you want? Sometimes, I wonder...

There's a highway to, to the edge, yeah
Once a night, you will drive yourself there
At the end of the road, you will find the answer
At the end of the road, you will drink your fear

I come down like a bloody rain cuts up flesh sky
A pulse beating under, yeah
Meat petals bloom in a bone garden
Ain't no God, no ghost gonna save you now
I sell souls at the side of the road
Would you like to take a number?

There's a highway to, to the edge, yeah
Once a night, you will drive yourself there
At the end of the road, you will find the answer
At the end of the road, you will drink your fear

Take your time, come on, get what you come for
Don't waste my time, come on, get what you come for
Don't waste my time, come on, get what you come for
Don't waste my time, come on, get what you come for

There's a highway to, to the edge, yeah
Once a night, you will drive yourself there
At the end of the road, you will find the answer
At the end of the road, you will drink your fear

I watched you burn in the eye of my sun
In the eye of my sun, yeah, yeah
I fucked you in, in the eye of my sun
In the eye of my sun, yeah, yeah

I watched you burn in the eye of my sun
In the eye of my sun, yeah, yeah
I fucked you in, in the eye of my sun
In the eye of my sun, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
