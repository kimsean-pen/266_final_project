I look at you and see
Someone I don't wanna be
And it's taking me too long to realize
I'm better off alone
All the times that you told me lies
And you know that it happend too many times
And it's time that I realize
I'm better off alone

I look at you and see
Someone I don't wanna be
And it's taking me too long to realize
I'm better off alone
All the times that you told me lies
And you know that it happend too many times
And it's time that I realize
I'm better off alone

I'm leaving you now
I want you to know
I know what I want and I knew all along
I couldn't let go but I'm not gonna stay anymore
So I'm leaving baby
I cannot forget all the pain that I had
All the things that you said
How you're making me mad
And you've made me feel bad all alone
This time I'm moving on

Leaving you don't need you anymore
Leaving you don't need you anymore
Leaving you don't need you anymore
Leaving you don't need you anymore

I am leaving you this time
I'm not letting you play with my mind
And I moving with my life
This time
I am leaving you behind
All the times that you told me lies
And you know that it happend too many times
Now it's time that I realize
I'm better off alone

All the times that you told me lies
And you know that it happend too many times
And it's time that I realize
I'm better off alone

I'm leaving you now (living you now)
I want you to know (leaving you now)
I know what I want and I knew all along (I want you to know)
I couldn't let go but I'm not gonna stay anymore (leaving you don't need you anymore)
So I'm leaving baby (I'm leaving baby)
I cannot forget all the pain that I had (I'm leaving baby)
All the things that you said
How you're making me mad (I'm leaving baby)
And you've made me feel bad all alone
It's time I will be alone. (I'm moving on)
