You might believe in Heaven
I would not care to say
For every star in Heaven
There's a sad soul here today

Wake up in the morning with a good face
Stare at the Moon all-day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway?
For all the prayers in Heaven
So much of life's this way

Did we leave our way behind us?
Such a long, long way behind us?
Who knows when, now who knows where?
Where the light of day will find us?
Look for the day

Take heart, my friend, we love you
Though it seems like you're alone
A million lights above you
Smile down upon your home
Oh, hurry, put your troubles in a suitcase
Come, let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
I'm leaving here, I'm long away
For all the stars in Heaven
I would not live
I could not live this way

Did we leave our way behind us?
Such a long, long way behind us?
Leave it for some hopeless lane
Such a long, long way
Such a long, long way
Such a long, long way
Such a long, long way
I'm looking for
Looking for that day
