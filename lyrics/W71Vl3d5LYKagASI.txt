These eyes
They're strongly covered in disguise
They're waiting on the real time again
You'll see
That no one knows for sure

For all of this
I'm better off without you
Do you regret all your loneliness?

This ride
Is drifting slowly to the side
We're swerving off the road
Going past the cones
That warned us from the start

For all of this
I'm better off without you
Do you regret all your loneliness?
For all of this
I'm better off without you
Do you regret all your loneliness?

Every day goes, every night goes
Every day goes, every night goes
Every day goes, every night

On and on,
We sing this song of tired days
That's oh so wrong
Every night we sing this song for you

For all of this
I'm better off without you
Do you regret all your loneliness?
For all of this
I'm better off without you
Do you regret all your loneliness?
