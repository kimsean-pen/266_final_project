Don't wannna discuss it
Think it's time for a change
You may get disgusted
Start thinkin' that I'm strange

In that case I'll go underground
Get some
Heavy rest
Never have to worry
About what is worst or what is best

Oh oh Domino
"It's all right"
Roll me over, Romeo
There you go
"Lord, have mercy"
I said oh-oh, Domino
Roll me over, Romeo, there you go
"Say it again"
I said oh-ooh-oh Domino
I said oh-ooh-ooh-oh Domino

"Dig it"

There's no need for argument
There's no argument at all
And if you never hear from him
That just means he didn't call
Or vice versa
That depends on where ever you're at
"All right"
And if you never hear from me
That just means I would rather not

"Hit it"

Oh oh Domino
"All right"
Roll me over Romeo, there you go
"Lord, have mercy"
I said, oh oh Domino
Roll me over Romeo, there you go
"Hey, all right"
"Say it again"
Oh-oh-ooh-ooh Domino
"Hey, hit it"
I said oh-ooh-ooh Domino

Well, Mr. DJ I just wanna hear
Some rhythm and blues music
On the radio
On the radio
On the radio

Uh-uh, all right
Uh-uh, all right
Uh-uh, all right
Uh-uh

"Hear the band"

"One more time"
