We stood outside the bank you once robbed
Hoping that someone would recognize you
And then we stood outside for hours and hours
But nobody could recognize you
And then we took off our shoes and we took off our clothes
And we jumped into the lake

This was never a mistake
No, this was never a mistake
I welcomed you into my arms
And you welcomed me into your heart

And I do wanna be here
And I don't wanna go
And I do wanna be here

I'm talking to my best friend
And we're talking like these days will never end
I'm talking to my best friend
And we're talking like
These days will never end
These days will never end
These days will never end
These days will never end

We drove to upstate New York looking for your father's grave
We drove there all the way and it took hours and hours
We passed your old neighborhood and your old house too
And that tree that you fell out of as a kid
And then we finally found it and there was a super mall instead
So we laughed off our heads, we laughed off our heads

I do wanna be here
And I don't wanna go
And I do wanna be here

I'm talking to my best friend
And we're talking like these days will never end
I'm talking to my best friend
And we're talking like
These days will never end
These days will never end
These days will never end
These days will never end

And then you said away
But I guessed you'll come back to stay
Our phases, never just a phase
We all change in so many ways

And the phases, never just a phase
And we change in so many ways
And the phases, never just a phase
And we change, yes we change

These days will never end
These days will never end
These days will never end
These will never end

And I do wanna be here
And I don't wanna go
And I do wanna be here
And I don't wanna go
And I do wanna be here
And I don't wanna go
But I don't wanna be anywhere else
