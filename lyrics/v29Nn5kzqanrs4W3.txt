[Fenriz]

All the moons she takes me over
Curve an arm to land the drawns
Unflinching wit and sense of just
A brilliant force for land and lover

The hand that reaches out
A glance that clears all doubt
Flowing hair in the fall
That laugh attracts them all

VALKYRIE

Secrets truly walk this earth
Those golden talismans of luck
Senses flair; your hunter's near
Forever head up high my dear
