Mmmm you're gonna want me back in your arms
You're gonna need me, one day
You're gonna want me back in your arms
You're gonna need me
One day
You're gonna want me back in your arms.

You're gonna wake up when time has taken your throne
You'll taste the bitterness of being alone
There's no splendor in the darkness of night
When there's no loving arms to hold you tight

(you better stop, and think about what you're doing)

Mmm give a little back
Of what you've been taking
Better start being for real and stop your faking
You better prepare yourself for that rainy day
You better throw a little tenderness and affection my way

You're gonna need me
Need me one day
You're gonna want me back in your arms

Tell me who's gonna take the heartbreak i took
And still be there at the close of the book
When you've grown older and lost your way
And all your rainbows have turned to gray

Mmm give a little back
Of what you've been taking
Better start being for real and stop your faking
You better prepare yourself for that rainy day
You better throw a little tenderness and affection my way
