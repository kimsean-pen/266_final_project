Hey, we've been going through some changes
Tell me that we'll make it
Tell me that we'll make it
Oh, I don't wanna be alone
Tell me that you'll hold on
Tell me that you'll hold on

Without you these walls get to feeling like they ain't gonna home

We're already halfway there
Are we gonna finish what we started
Or just leave it here?
'Cause the fight ain't fair
If we're hanging onto something
Only halfway there
Can wait forever
We know better than to let it go
We're already halfway there
We're already halfway there

Hey, I don't wanna be that story
Where the ending goes missing
'Cause we couldn't go the distance
Say, let me hear you say you understand
We'll do all we can
And this ain't the end
And this ain't the end

With you is not just a feeling, it's body and soul

We're already halfway there
Are we gonna finish what we started
Or just leave it here?
'Cause the fight ain't fair
If we're hanging onto something
Only halfway there
Can wait forever
We know better than to let it go
We're already halfway there
We're already halfway there

Hey, we've been going through some changes
Tell me that we'll make it
Tell me that we'll make it
Halfway there
Fight ain't fair

We're already halfway there
Are we gonna finish what we started
Or just leave it here?
'Cause the fight ain't fair
If we're hanging onto something
Only halfway there
Can wait forever
We know better than to let it go
We're already halfway there
We're already halfway there
