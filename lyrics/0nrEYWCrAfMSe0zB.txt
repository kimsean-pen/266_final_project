Like a train in the morning
I'll wake you up without warning
And I love the west coast
I'm tired of holding my friends to a city
Without a single reason, not to leave

You said you'll go to Seattle
And make some money selling weed

Friends love friends moving on
I'm so sick of being wrong

Stop romanticizing problems
It's killing children every day
And I'm sitting on a stairwell
Making sure that you're okay
And you say you're on drugs now
And the world's a beautiful place

Friends love friends moving on
I'm so sick of being wrong

Friends love friends moving on
I'm so sick of being wrong
