Though you haven't heard too much from me
Like I'm a world apart
Your mama says you're doing well, I'm so sorry
I haven't been there

I got my baby saying now it's okay
But he knows that it's not okay
What did I fall off?
When did my heart go under the grave?

Baby, I'm something else
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
Yeah, I've always been the one who cares for you
That's there for you
I know that I've been taking you for granted
I know that I've been leaving you stranded

When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?

Flash my mind, yeah, I've been captured
By my greed
I let it all slip, yeah, let it get
Away from me

I got my baby saying now it's okay
But he knows that it's not okay
What did I fall off?
When did my heart go under the grave?

Baby, I'm something else
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
Yeah, I've always been the one who cares for you
That's there for you
I know that I've been taking you for granted
I know that I've been leaving you stranded
When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?

You say you won't forget about me
Please say you won't forget about me
When it all goes down
When it all goes down, down
Please say you won't forget about me

Oh baby, I'm something else
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
Yeah, I've always been the one who cares for you
That's there for you
I know that I've been taking you for granted
I know that I've been leaving you stranded
When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?

When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?
When did my heart go under the grave?
