If you can see tears
And you can see that I'm being choked and
It is my fear
All this time I have been broken
You send me the biggest pressure
But also the sweetest treasure
To hold them we'll make it true
Believe it I'm doing it for you

If only I could scream, I would do it loud
I would do it to you
I'll say you're all I see and you're all I feel
But you'll never love me

You say that the prettiest thing
Is to give somebody a song

It would make one heal
Make one see what it wants to feel

If only I could scream, I would do it loud
I would do it for you
I'll say you're all I see and you're all I feel
But you'll never will

If only I could scream, I would do it loud
I would do it to you
I'll say you're all I see and you're all I feel
But you'll never love me
