I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing 'til they got a hold of me
I'd open doors for little old ladies, I helped the blind to see

I got no friends 'cause they read the papers, they can't be seen
With me and I'm gettin' real shot down and I'm feelin' mean

No More Mister Nice Guy, No more Mister clean...
No More Mister Nice Guy They say he's sick, he's obscene...

I got no friends 'cause they read the papers, they can't be seen
With me and I'm gettin' real shot down and I'm, I'm gettin' mean

No More Mister Nice Guy, No more Mister clean...
No More Mister Nice Guy they say he's sick, he's obscene...

My dog bit me on the leg today, My cat clawed my eyes
Ma's been thrown out of the social circle and Dad has to hide

I went to church incognito, when everybody rose
The Reverend Smedley, He recognized me and punched me in the nose

He said: No More Mister Nice Guy, No more Mister clean...
No More Mister Nice Guy He said you're sick, you're obscene...

No More Mister Nice Guy, No more Mister clean...
No More Mister Nice Guy, He said you're sick, you're obscene...
