From the moment I met you
Admiration has grown yet so have you
Your kindness sealed all the cracks
Carried me out of the lion's mouth

I always knew you would be the king
You never yielded you never kneeled
And my visions are bleeding alive
So grateful to have you in my sight
And when my shoulders are caving in
From the burdens I'm gifted with
I will push back I won't squeal
So go ahead lover watch me win
I hope you realise
I'm not for Christmas I'm for life
Where I'm from we don't hold back
Life is pain brother
But we know that
And when my shoulders are caving in
From the burdens I'm gifted with
I will push back I won't squeal
So go ahead lover watch me win
I love my blood brother
I love my blood brother
I love my blood brother
I love my blood brother
I love my blood brother
I love my blood brother
I love my blood brother
I love you Joe Talbot
When my shoulders are caving in
From the burdens I'm gifted with
I will push back I won't squeal
So go ahead lover watch me win
Watch me win brother
Watch me win
