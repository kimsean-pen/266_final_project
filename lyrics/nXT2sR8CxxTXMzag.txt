There once was love thrown into your room
But you never knew
A calendar of days just for you
But you never knew, never knew, no
And the truth that you'll find will always be
The truth you hide

So how do you love?
How do you love?
When your angels can't sing
And your world is still lacking of me, yeah, yeah

There once were eyes that only saw you
But you never knew
A portrait of a flower in full bloom
But you never knew, never knew, no
And the words that you fear will always be
The words you hear, yeah, yeah

So how do you love?
How do you love?
When your angels can't sing
And your world is still lacking of me, yeah, yeah

This space where you've been living
Has gifts you've never given
That's the face you always show
Ask me for words of wisdom
Tell me of your condition
I don't know, I don't, I don't know

And the truth that you'll find will always be
The truth you hide, yeah, yeah

So how do you love?
How do you love?
When your angels can't sing
And your world is still lacking of me, yeah

So how do you love?
How do you love?
When your angels can't sing
And your world is still lacking of me, yeah, yeah, yeah

How do you love?
How do you love?
How do you love?
