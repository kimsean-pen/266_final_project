Tell me, O Mountain, what secrets do you hold
Buried deep beneath the earth in hidden walls of stone?
If ever man in all his days climbed your mighty slopes
To behold the gods as they danced, and listen as they spoke.

Tell me, O Mountain, your secrets!

Hear me, O'Spirits, I would ask of thee,
To locate a lass who's fair of form and deliver her to me
The road can be a lonely place to pass the time,
Watching and waiting as the miles roll by.

Hear me, O Spirits, lend me your aid!

Tell me, O Mountain, what secrets do you hold,
Crowded on your misty feet or deep within your bones?

Tell me, O Mountain, your deepest secrets!
