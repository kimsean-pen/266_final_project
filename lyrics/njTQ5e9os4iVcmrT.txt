Sits in valley, lost in a hotel
She knows all of the warehouses
I wish we'd cross paths some more
But I had to go away

Loving, hide in the cornfields
I've been staying for a picnic
Now I try to follow you back
Don't think it's time

I go, sad in this part of town
I'm dizzy, I'm finding my way out
You know, let's get out of tune
Get unfound

Well, let's have another bow
How should I perform now?
These times, it gets harder
To stay away from you

How now?
How now?
How now?
How?
