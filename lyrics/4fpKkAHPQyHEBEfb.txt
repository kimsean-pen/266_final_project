I can feel in my body
Chains on me are breaking loose
I can feel in my body
Standing tall I make the moves

With the sun kissing my face
There's no way that I can lose

And the thing that I
Crave your embrace
You're the one that's being you

I hear you say
I can't let you leave my life like this
I hear you say
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave

Either way that I
Can't keep feeling the pain of your touch
Your touch keeps on hurting

Either way that I
Can't keep feeling the pain of your touch
Your touch keeps on hurting

Gotta let this go
Gotta feel some more on my own
Your touch keeps on hurtin'

Gotta let this go
Gotta feel some more on my own
Your touch keeps on hurtin'

I can feel in my body
Free from all the things you wear
I can feel in my body
Shows me the way, show me the way

I hear you say
I can't let you leave my life like this
I hear you say
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave

Either way that I
Can't keep feeling the pain of your touch
Your touch keeps on hurting

Either way that I
Can't keep feeling the pain of your touch
Your touch keeps on hurting

Gotta let this go
Gotta feel some more on my own
Your touch keeps on hurtin'

Gotta let this go
Gotta feel some more on my own
Your touch keeps on hurtin'

Hurting this way
Hurting this way
Hurting this way
Hurting this way

Hurting this way
Hurting this way
Hurting this way
Hurting this way

Hurting this way
Hurting this way
Hurting this way
Hurting this way

Either way that I
Can't keep feeling the pain of your touch
Your touch keeps on hurting

Either way that I
Can't keep feeling the pain of your touch
Your touch keeps on hurting

Gotta let this go
Gotta feel some more on my own
Your touch keeps on hurtin'

Gotta let this go
Gotta feel some more on my own
Your touch keeps on hurtin'
