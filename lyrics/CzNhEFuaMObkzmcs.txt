Let this be the epitaph for my heart
Cupid put too much poison in the dart
This is the epitaph for my heart
because it's gone, gone gone
and life goes on and on anon
and death goes on, world without end
and you're not my friend

Who will mourn the passing of my heart
Will its little droppings climb the pop chart
Who'll take its ashes and,
singing, fling them from the top of the Brill Building
And life goes on, and dawn, and dawn
and death goes on, world without end and you're
not my friend
