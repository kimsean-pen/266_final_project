Relax my beloved, don't worry for me
Don't shed a tear for me, always be near for me
Be comforted my love, don't bow you head for me
Promise you'll smile for me, don't ever cry for me

You know these walls
They may fall down but I'll still hold on to you
At heights higher
Than you'd imagine me to

Then maybe again we would weep
Like we've done a thousand times before
Don't turn your back on me or shout
As you walk out the door, no, no, no, no

Just be still my heart, I'm only a moment away
In the next room or at the break of day
And I will walk once again to see your face again
And I hear every word you'd have to say

Then maybe again we would weep
Like we've done a thousand times before
Don't turn your back on me or shout
As you walk out the door, no, no, no, no, no
Then maybe again we would weep
Like we've done a thousand times before
Don't turn your back on me or shout
As you walk out the door, no, no, no, no, no, no
