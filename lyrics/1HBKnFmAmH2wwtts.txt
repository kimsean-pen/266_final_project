I've gone to hell and back searching for answers that do not exist
I tore everything apart, needing a reason for feeling like this
It left me with nothing but this hole in my chest
So I looked inside to see what I'd find the true journey begins

Don't hide the truth inside of you from anyone
I just can't be what they want me to be
Can anyone?

I made a promise to myself that I intend to keep
I made a promise that I will no longer live 3 feet from peace
