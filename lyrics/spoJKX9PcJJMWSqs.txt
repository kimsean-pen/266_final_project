We are dark
The way the night stretches over the sun
And we're up to no good
Yeah we're up to no good
No we won't go peaceful
There is no excuse for the way that we live
Yeah we're up to no good
No we won't go peaceful

Will you release me, my friend
There's nowhere to run or hide
Again and again
Getting lost in the depths of my mind
And this cell can't hold back
My dangerous thoughts

959 miles away is where you'll find me
I'm afraid I've been locked away
Throw out the key (Throw out the key)
Throw out the key
I'm afraid I've been locked away

We are dark

There's no where to run or hide

My dangerous thoughts
There's no where to run or hide
Getting lost in the depths of my mind

I'm afraid I've been locked away
Throw out the key (Throw out the key)
Throw out the key
I'm afraid I've been locked away

Don't look back

Don't look back
Get me the hell away from here
You don't know you're free, until you're locked away
Even just for a day
I tell you I'm not the man I used to be
