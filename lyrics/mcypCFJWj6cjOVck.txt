I'm not open, feel an emotion, put it away
I can't even tell you where I am right now
'Cause I don't feel light and she don't feel right
We shouldn't be, shouldn't be, shouldn't be here we are
And I've already changed my face to show that I'm okay

But I'm stuck set and saying we can try it again,
you've got your hurt in your hands - I am giving in
You want to talk about,
maybe that's the reason I've been feeling out loud

And it all comes to how we lost you,
I think we'll meet again, I'm sure
And it all comes down without you.
I think we'll meet again, I'm sure

I'm cold and take an emotion, put it away
And I can't even tell you how I feel right now
Cause I don't see light and I don't feel right
We shouldn't be, shouldn't be, shouldn't be here we are
And I wanted to change your name and she could have the same

But I'm stuck set and saying we can try it again,
you've got your hurt in your hands - I am giving in
You want to talk about,
maybe that's the reason I've been feeling out loud

And it all comes to how we lost you,
I think we'll meet again, I'm sure
And it all comes down without you.
I think we'll meet again, I'm sure

Now I remember the word of the lullaby prayer
I wanted to sing to you
Now I remember the way that I buckled
Under the weight of a black balloon

And it all comes to we lost you,
I think we'll meet again, I'm sure
And it all comes down without you.
I think we'll meet again, I'm sure
