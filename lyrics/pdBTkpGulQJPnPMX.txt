you're the most spiteful person
I could
never be
so when I hear your name around town
hurts me
my stomach drops to
the ground
must
mean
something
pitiful we couldn't recognize
a perfect thing
and I can't breathe at all
at all
violet was all around
without you
fading out

you're the most spiteful person
I could
never be
so when I hear
your name
around town
kills me

and I can't breathe at all
at all
violet was all around
without you
fading out

without you
fading out
