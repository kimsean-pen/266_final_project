The street was loud
from an angry crowd and
i thought of you, i thought of you
dreamer
land of the free
no hungry bellies
impossible
impossible dreamer
In the darkest part of the night
blue shadows conjure you
and in the brightest height of the daylight
sometimes i blink 'cause i think i see you
dreaming like you do
The moon was bright
like day for night
and i thought of you
i thought of you
dreamer
no acid rain
love without pain
impossible
impossible dreamer
In the darkest part of the night
blue shadows conjure you
and at the brightest height of the daylight
sometimes i blink 'cause i think i see you
dreaming like you do
The room was dark
and full of sharks
and i thought of you
i thought of you
dreamer
give peace a chance
don't think just dance
impossible
impossible dreamer
In the darkest part of the night
blue shadows conjure you
and at the brightest height of the daylight
sometimes i blink 'cause i think i see you
dreaming like you do
