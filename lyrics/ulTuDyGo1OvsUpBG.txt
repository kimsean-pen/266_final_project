In a simple skirt you caused a ricochet
Of courting boys that watch you walk away
But I don't live my life like you do,
no, I don't live my life like you do

So, hold me down and never let me go
A school boy grin it only goes to show,
That I could never have such control,
Every time you leave
Every time you leave
I wanna go

Rip me up and bully me in jest
About the afternoons that you've sleeping on my chest
But I don't live my life like you do,
no, I don't live my life like you do

So, hold me down and never let me go
A school boy grin it only goes to show,
That I could never have such control,
Every time you leave
Every time you leave
I wanna go

So, hold me down and never let me go
A school boy grin it only goes to show,
That I could never have such control,
Every time you leave
Every time you leave
I wanna go
