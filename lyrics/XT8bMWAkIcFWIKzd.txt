Lost in this place like fragments of another time
I close my eyes and see myself from above
Drifting apart like splinters of scattered glass
But we all have our own reasons to continue

Don't you want it this way?
(I can't go on)
Don't you need it this way?
(I can't go on)
Don't you love it this way?
(I can't go on)
Don't you need it anyway?

I can't come down when you're around
I lose control and hit the ground
Everything must change
And it all remains the same
This is a stillborn universe

We are battered, we are torn
(It pleases me to see you broken)
We're the hate that you adore
(It pleases me to see you broken)

We are hollow, we are bruised
(It pleases me to see you broken)
We are numb and self-abused
(It pleases me to see you broken)

I can't come down when you're around
I lose control and hit the ground
Everything must change
And it all remains the same
This is a stillborn universe

You thought that life would be so wonderful
You thought that all could be so beautiful
You thought that everything would be so simple
You thought that everything would be so perfect

I can't come down when you're around
I lose control and hit the ground
Everything must change
And it all remains the same
This is a stillborn universe

I can't come down when you're around
I lose control and hit the ground
Everything must change
And it all remains the same
This is a stillborn universe

I can't come down
