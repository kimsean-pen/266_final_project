I'm so glad you're my girl
I'll do anything for you
call you every night
and give you flowers too

I thank the lord for you
and think about you all the time
and ask him every day

that you'll forever be mine

(I wanna hold your hand)
to show you I'll be there

(I like to do the things)
let you know I care

(I sing this lullaby)

'cause girl you fill me full
(I look into your eyes)
you're so beautiful

Oh girl I think I love you
I'm always thinking of you
I want you to know
I do it all for love

I love it when we're together
girl I need you forever
and I want you to know
I do it all for love

I will never leave you sugar

this I guarantee
I look into the future
I see you and me
Knight in shining amor

I will be your fairytale
I wanna take care of you girl

I'll serve you well
(I will be there for you)
to catch you when you fall
(I'll hold you in my arms)
that's where you belong
(I sing this lullaby)
'cause girl you fill me full
(I look into your eyes)
