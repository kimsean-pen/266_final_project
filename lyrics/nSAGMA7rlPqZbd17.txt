Well, excuse me motherfucker, you're on my block
Pack 'em up and ship 'em off the rock
You can park your car anywhere you want
But by the time you get back, bet that shit's ripped off
I can't promise you that
But I promise I'd be back with the sack that you asked
When you're thinking about doing so stupid shit at my home
Remember, you're on my rock

Get off my block
Get off my rock
Get off my rock
Get off my rock

Fuck it, I need a cigarette
I need a bag of ice, I need some Heineken
And a boom box bumpin' out some real hood shit
And some Pakololo, grown local
What bada you? Are we too local?
Are we too loco? Are we too vocal?
When you're on the beach reading some book that you bought
Remember, you're on my rock

Get off my block
Get off my rock
Get off my block
Get off my rock

Bring it back down with some island shit
False crack a tourist and let's steal their shit
And take 'em to my Uncle that knows how to sell it
I wasn't made, I was born like this
Big fuckin' deal if you get gentrified
Back in the day it was called colonized
So when you're on vacation tryna "find yourself"
Just remember to

Get off my rock
Get off my block
Get off my rock
Get off my block
Get off my rock
Get off my block
Get off my rock
