This cage was meant to be torn apart
So why maintain it
This life means nothing to me at all
So why take the risk
Why force my hand
Your place is there
With your own kind
There's more to lust
Than a finite desire
My plans will fall apart on their own
I don't need you for that
I promise, I can fuck this up just fine
I used to think
I'd change your mind
I used to think
You'd save my life
I won't be missed
I won't be mourned
No one's looking at you now
You are on your own
In fact I'm already dead
But lights still flicker overhead
A few less cops in this town
But in the end it just took one to put me down
So what do you think it's worth
The gift of life, the joy of birth
Well, it's a little less than I'd hoped
Disappointed to find
No deeper meaning to the joke
