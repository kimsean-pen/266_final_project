Harvesting life by clenching shut the nourishing veins, trapping the vivid to spiral in panic.
Suffocating until life withers away.
Leaving only parasites to thrive in a sterile world.
A world built on the love for cold.
Tainted, seduced to fulfil others greed.
Death for pride, wealth for glory, embrace the inception.
Trapped in the illusion of pleasure.
