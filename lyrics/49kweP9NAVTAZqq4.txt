I used to think that this was perfect.
And wish that it was never ending.
But those days are gone forever.
It's something I'm not missing

There's a force there's a voice, in my head
Telling me to think
About the times that you were cruel and mean
And I don't care if you walk away,

I'm here to stay and you need to hear,

You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing

Here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only
One

You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing
Here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only

One
I have to take advantage,
Before the moment passes by
It's so hard to manage,

The ups and downs of your life
Someone help, someone speak, before I start to scream out
Anything to break the silence
You're holding me back,

Confined
By
Doubt.

You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing
Here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only

One
You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing
Here

You make me sick!
And I can't be the only
One
'Cause I need you

'Cause I need you here with me
When it falls through
And I'm down
Upon my knees
(solo)
There's a force, There's a voice in my head
Telling me to
Think about everything
Last time I believed
Now
I
Realize!

You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing
Here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only
One
You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing
Here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only
One
You make me sick sick sick!
Sick! Sick! Sick! Sick!

You make me sick! Sick sick sick sick

You make me sick! sick sick
Sick sick sick sick

You make me sick! Sick sick sick sick
