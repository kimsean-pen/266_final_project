real heart-breaker come and take me
to the real heart ache that everyone's talking 'bout.
you see me then you don't
but get it right, i don't believe in magic.

fire kites drifting through the skies
up on high i see it all the time
and from the tip top of every mountain view
from the roof i spy on room to room.

take me home
i walk the night in the valley
oh ohh oh
'til everything is fine

i walked all night, and typically that's fine
but i might try sleeping for a bit.
tell me why you know the things you do
and how'd you get there?
to be there, it must be great for you.

take me home
i walk the night in the valley
oh ohh oh
'til everything is fine [x2]

i don't see everything as right
it's not right
i don't see everything as right and wrong
it's so wrong
but i don't see everything as wrong

take me home
i walk the night in the valley
oh ohh oh
'til everything is fine

take me home
i walk the night in the valley
oh ohh oh
'til everything is fine
'til everything is fine
'til everything is fine
'til everything is fine
'til everything is fine
