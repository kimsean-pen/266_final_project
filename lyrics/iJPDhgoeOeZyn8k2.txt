I hear you, respect, go build a narrative for yourself
The one voice you're listening to could set it all apart
In the crowded hell outside your mouth
But tell me not to feel everything
I can't, I can't, I can't
But I could understand anything you'd need now
Except for you to vanish in your final act

How much violence can silence create?
Is emptiness the heaviest weight?
If you see me sinking and just stand in the wake
Who am I to judge the call you make?

And you'll be like, out of sight out of mind
But I'm right here all the time
You'll keep it moving on like "Oh it's all fine"
But you know nothing disappears when you turn out a light, right?

When I gave you everything
As it turns out, you didn't need everything
Ooh did it satisfy anything
To cut it out, to shut me down?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

That I'll believe in everything
And I tore it all apart
The residue breaking my back
I had an attitude
And you can't, can't, can't stand that
I hear you, respect your solitude
But was it poetry when you told me you would be right back?

How much violence can silence create?
Is emptiness the heaviest weight?
If you see me sinking and just stand in the wake
Who am I to judge the call you make?

And you'll be like, out of sight out of mind
But I'm right here all the time
You'll keep it moving on like "Oh it's all fine"
But you know nothing disappears when you turn out a light, right?

Get yourself into something deep
But then you wanna make it easier
One solution is to separate
Mine is always to go deeper
Get yourself into something deep
But then you wanna make it easier
One solution is to separate
Mine is always to go deeper
