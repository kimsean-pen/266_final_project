It's late at night and I'm feeling down
There are couples standing on the street
Sharing summer kisses and silly sounds

So, I step inside, pour a glass of wine
With a full glass and an empty heart
I search for something to occupy my mind

'Cause you are in my head
Swimming forever in my head
Tangled in my dreams
Swimming forever
So, listen to the radio
And all the songs we used to know
So, listen to the radio
Remember where we used to go

Now, it's morning light and it's cold outside
Caught up in a distant dream
I turn and think that you are by my side

So, I leave my bed and I try to dress
Wondering why my mind plays tricks and fools me into thinking you are there

But, you're still in my head
Swimming forever in my head
Not lying in my bed
Just swimming forever

So, listen to the radio
And all the songs we used to know
So, listen to the radio
Remember where we used to go
So, listen to the radio
And all the songs we used to know
So, listen to the radio
Remember where we used to go

You are in my head
Swimming forever

So, listen to the radio
And all the songs we used to know
So, listen to the radio
Remember where we used to go
I listen to the radio
To all the songs we used to know
I listen to the radio
To all the songs, all the song we used to know
All the song we used to know
All the song we used to know
