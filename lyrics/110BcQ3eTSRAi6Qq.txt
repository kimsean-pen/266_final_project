i feel alright
i found a place that fits tight
its feels small
but i won't get sad about it
the softest voice said to me
all through last night
i forget
but i wont feel bad about it
ill stay inside and find a page that sounds right
bombs outside
such small birds laughing at me

be me
be mine
i might have not have reminded you to feel
(mine to feel)

be me
be mine
i might have not reminded you to feel
(mine to feel)

i feel alright
i found a face that fits tight
it feels small
but i won't get sad about it
