Tell me I won't be forgotten...
If just for the moment...

I look into the sky
I'm crying out your name
I've made my mistakes and I'm the only one to blame
Help me, I need to feel your grace
And I've been waiting, waiting in the darkest place!

For so long, I can barely breathe
The grip of the guilt and the scars of my sins live on
They're choking me
For so long, I can barely breathe
The grip of the guilt and the scars of my sins are suffocating me
Now I can barely breathe

Tell me I won't be forgotten
If just for the moment
Tell me I won't be forgotten
If just for the moment

For so long, I can barely breathe
The grip of the guilt and the scars of my sins live on
They're choking me
For so long, I can barely breathe
Show me the light I need to see

Tell me I won't be forgotten
If just for the moment
Tell me I won't be forgotten
If just for the moment
Will time heal my pain?
Send me to the grave!
Will I die in vain?
Tell me, I won't be forgotten
If just for a moment

The road back to you feels so long
With so many battles along the way
I put all of this on my myself
And I should accept the blame for everyone I hurt
Through all my mistakes
Those who look down on me
You show me your face in a way I can see

I look into the sky
I'm crying out your name
I made my mistakes but you forgave me!
You forgave me!

Tell me I won't be forgotten
If just for the moment
Tell me I won't be forgotten
If just for the moment
Will time heal my pain?
Send me to the grave!
Will I die in vain?
Tell me I won't be forgotten
If just for a moment
(Tell me I won't be forgotten!)
If just for a moment
