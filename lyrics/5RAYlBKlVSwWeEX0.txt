I shove my love in your eye
this queen bee is ready to die
you'll need someone holier than Moses
Mary won't cut it this time
I'll sterilize the prize
when you wake you won't give life
did you think I was blinded by your light
father forgive me I have sinned
I revenge
I revenge
look what I did to my man
I gave in
father forgive me I have sinned
I revenge
I revenge
look what I did to my man
I gave in
Your devils on my back the viper strikes
his blood is black
though I forget what you did
I count the days your lungs push air
What about the nights when you held me like a fallen soldier
who clings to life
I've never hurt anyone
I know it's time
time
father forgive me I have sinned
I revenge
I revenge
look what I did to my man
I gave in
father forgive me I've send
I revenge
I revenge
Look what I did to my man
I gave in
tell me what it feels like going down in history
my father has a place for you
to gnash your teeth
tell me what it feels like going down in history
as a creep
father has a place for you
to gnash your teeth
I wait
