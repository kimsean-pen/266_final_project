Don't wanna take my country back
I wanna take my country forward
Don't wanna take my country back
I wanna take my country forward

Don't wanna take my country back
Everyone's preaching to the choirs
Words billow up and get trapped in trash fires
Fists of fury, engaged one's neighbour
Reeling around in the echo chamber

Now look what we've done to ourselves
We've really gone and fucked it this time
Look what we've done to ourselves

So get up get up and feel the rising tide
I'm fed up fed up with all the cyanide
Get up get up and feel the rising tide
Get up get up (get up get up)

There's anger stashed in the creases of your face
That burning rage could gut a castle
But you torched your neighbour
And now your whole town is ablaze

And everyone is seeing red
Like the pyromaniacs in the a stronghold
Sparking fury, engage one's neighbour
Twisting the truth with a blame-thrower

Now look what we've done to ourselves
We've really gone and fucked it this time
Look what we've done to ourselves

So get up get up and feel the rising tide
I'm fed up fed up with all the cyanide
Get up get up and feel the rising tide
Get up get up (get up get up)

I don't wanna take my country back
I wanna take my country forward
I don't wanna take my country back
I wanna take my country forward
I don't wanna take my country back
I wanna take my country forward
I don't wanna take my country back
I wanna take my country forward

I feel like we're living on the edge
And the cliffs are eroding
I feel like we're living on the edge
And the cliffs are eroding
I feel like we're living on the edge
And the cliffs are eroding
I feel like we're living on the edge

So get up get up and feel the rising tide
I'm fed up fed up with all the cyanide
Get up get up and feel the rising tide
Get up get up (get up get up)
