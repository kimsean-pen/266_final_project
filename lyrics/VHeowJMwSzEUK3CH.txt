I felt this instant of desire
Before I went back to my head
And then I crawl back
Into your arms

Can it stay between us?
But we do not say such words
Among the other things you know
But we do not say such words
In this endless "in between"
But we do not say such words
I will never learn, I know
But we do not state such words

We shared a moment of happiness
Before the train pulls our hands
And then I fall into pieces
And then we fall into pieces

Can it stay between us?
But we do not say such words
Among the other things you know
But we do not say such words
In this endless "in between"
But we do not say such words
I will never learn, I know
But we do not state such words

Can it stay between us?
But we do not say such words
Among the other things you know
But we do not say such words
In this endless "in between"
But we do not say such words
I will never learn, I know
But we do not state such words
