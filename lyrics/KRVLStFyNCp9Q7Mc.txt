Find yourself in a strangest place
Don't know where you were and how you came
Everything around you is unreal

So you say goodbye
but don't know where to go

white light
noise it makes
terrified I call out
nothing came
no one
just an empty hollow

Motionless I lie inside of me
Fearing pain is all I ever feel

white light
noise it makes
terrified I call out
nothing came
no one
just an empty hollow
