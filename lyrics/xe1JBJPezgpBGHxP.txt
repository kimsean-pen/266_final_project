Bombs rain down like heaven's tears
The earth shall die and disappear
And today, we wish the skies were grey
For now they're just black and empty

Ripped and torn from inside out
Things too dark to think about
No miracles
No bleeding hands
God has parted

Bombs rain down like heaven's tears
The earth shall die and disappear
And today, we wish the skies were grey
For now they're just black and empty

And when the end, she comes
Rains down on everyone
Fire from the sky
And when the end, she rides
Breathing out suicide
Life and death are one

And when the end, she comes
Rains down on everyone
Fire from the sky
And when the end, she rides
Breathing out suicide
Life and death are one

As a flame burns to touch the sky
So it shall be with man's cry
And this night all will pass away

And when the end, she comes
Rains down on everyone
Fire from the sky
And when the end, she rides
Breathing out suicide
Life and death are one

And when the end, she comes
Rains down on everyone
Fire from the sky
And when the end, she rides
Breathing out suicide
Life and death are one
