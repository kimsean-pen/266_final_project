Out of all the reindeers you know you are the mastermind
Run, run Rudolph, Randalph ain't too far behind
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph 'cause I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a boy child, "What have you been longing for?"
All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar
And then away went Rudolph, whizzing like a shooting star

Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, reelin' like a merry-go-round

Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Can't you make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a girl child, "What would please you most to get?"
A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink and wet
And then away went Rudolph, whizzing like a Saber jet
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round
