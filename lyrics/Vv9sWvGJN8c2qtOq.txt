We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on
Here we write on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on
Here we write on

Yo, I try to get it how I live it
A lot of people countin' on me kinda like a digit
It's a cold world; I'm not frontin' like it isn't
There's no time for comin' up shorter than a midget
Y'all know I'm-a raise the bar though like Bridgette
See every star go; don't blink--you might miss it
It's precious cargo--you gotta be strong to lift it
The light comes in different types; be more specific
Shit, I'm Blackthought--what could be more prolific?
For this love I go above and beyond the limit
I told y'all I'm above and beyond the gimmick
I get into your head and spread like a pandemic
I never put myself in a race I can't finish
I'm well grounded, founded on the same premise
As any man with a hit list, it's 'bout business
Yo, can a brother get a witness? Dig it; right on

We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on
Here we write on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on
Here we write on

A'ight, okay, I'm above and beyond hot
My measurement in watts
Time rate and flow of energy ain't never gonna stop
Pressure's on, I won't pop; microphone I won't drop
Gym stones, niggas copyin' shit if I ain't in the spot
It's the Orion that I hop, the new star to hit
I shine a light for the future so my presence's a gift
It's evident I'm Heaven-sent with Thomas Edison elements
Reverent for what I represent to show my benevolence
This is Dilly; I'm reppin' for the art of the city
Came from Southwest Atlantic and gave my heart to the city
Where slugs fly, thugs cry 'cause every part of it's gritty
Niggas shootin' up the club like they party with Diddy
You pick the diggy; I put my incandescence to fluorescence
And an essence I convert with (?) for energy per second
I put 'em on the lessons while I'm smokin' on a pleasant
A switch hitter like Pete Rose, right at the session
Right on

We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on
Here we write on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on
Here we write on
