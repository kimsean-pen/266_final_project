you are like red wine
hurting me all the time
the more i see of you
the less i want to do

oh honey
i can't have anymore
oh honey
i can't have anymore
oh honey
i can't have anymore
oh honey
i can't have anymore

when i am alone
i swear that i am done
but when i hear you knock
i always take you back

oh honey
i can't have anymore
oh honey
i can't have anymore
oh honey
i can't have anymore
oh honey
i can't have anymore
