I wish I could stop myself
You gotta tell me there's nothing there (nothing there)
I don't want nobody else
Hoping one day you might care (yea yea yea)

Voices saying, just hold back
And erase the heart drawn on your sleeve (your sleeve)
I won't stop wishin', wishin' for you're my baby
Ha! Then watch you come to me

You got me daydreamin'
That's all I got, all I got
Daydreamin'
Of what I want, what I want
Daydreamin'
That's all I got, all I got
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know, know
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know, know

Imagination running wild (Running wild!)
And then to realize this ain't real (Real, real, real)
Please just hit me with the truth (Truth)
It really hurt if it's all I feel (All I feel)

Voices saying, just hold back
And erase the heart drawn on your sleeve (your sleeve)
I won't stop wishin', wishin' for you're my baby
I want you here with me

You got me daydreamin'
That's all I got, all I got
Daydreamin'
Of what I want, what I want
Daydreamin'
That's all I got, all I got
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know, know
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know, know
I thought of leaving my heart away, yea
I'm flirting, I'm flirting

You'll give me blessing, I'm just here to say
Oh, oh, oh!
You got me daydreamin'
That's all I got, all I got
Daydreamin'
Of what I want, what I want
Daydreamin'
That's all I got, all I got
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know, know
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know, know
