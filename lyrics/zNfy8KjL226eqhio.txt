I wanna be down with you
Don't wanna be down in the dumpsters worry 'bout nothing
Cheer up, baby, might never happen (Hey)
And I wanna snap out of it
Don't wanna be out of my mind
On the low full of dime
Loosen up, babe, now, let's take a break (Hey)

Shallow waters, not deep enough to drown
But just enough to get lost until I'm found
Shallow waters, not deep enough for danger
But just enough to want trouble with a stranger

You're selling me rich girl problems
With a poor man's life inside
So I work to the bone for nothing
But I see this from the outside
Even though I look so perfect
I don't like these rules that apply
Or these brand new chains ain't worth it
So I'm gonna break free from my life

Shallow waters, not deep enough to drown
But just enough to get lost until I'm found
Shallow waters, not deep enough for danger
But just enough to want trouble with a stranger
(Woah!)

Not deep enough to drown
Not deep enough for danger
