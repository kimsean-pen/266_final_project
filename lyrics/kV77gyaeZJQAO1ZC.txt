Oh yeah! Oh my darlin' stand by me!
No matter who you are, no matter where you go in life
You gonna need somebody to stand by you.
No matter how much money you got, or powerful you can be,
You gonna need somebody, to stand by you

Grandpa...

When the night has come, and the land is dark,
And that moon is the only light we see.
No I won't be afraid, no I-I-I won't shed one tear
Just as long as you people here stand by me.

Whenever you're in trouble,
Come and stand by me
Come on and stand by me
Oh-oh-oh stand, stand by me, stand by me

When that sky that we look upon
Oh, should tumble and fall
Or the mountains they should crumble into the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darling, darling stand by me, oh stand by me,
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me.

Stand by me, stand by me,
Come on and stand,
Please stand, come on, people I need you to stand by me,
I'm lonely, I'm lonely, lonely, lonely, I need you to stand by me.

And your precious love means so much to me
than anyone could ever see
And when I wanted you
So lonely and so blue
Now that I found love with you
And darling I

Stand by me, stand by me,
Woh, stand by me...
