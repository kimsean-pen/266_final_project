Stacked up to my height
turn and see you cry.
Crumpled down to my size
broken by your fathers vice.
Those years you don't remember
I spent crumpling leather.
In the seat next to where you drive
where you gave your best advice.

Your favourite song line hurts
I didn't understand it at first
but an empty seat on your ride home
reminds me how often you are alone
