You say you gotta leave the party in 10
You're never leaving with all your best friends
You go home
You're always leaving alone

I waited for you out on the back porch
You never came but it had happened before
It's true
I'm always left waiting for you

It feels crazy that we're getting so old
It feels crazy that we're all so

You don't drink even a couple of beers
And your dreams
The point of being seventeen

Bc we miss sleep and we all don't care
You're contradicting your long dark hair
And your youth
You should be dancing 'til your face turns blue

Then you wonder why you're feeling so old
Then you wonder why you're feeling so

Grown

Everybody's asking 'bout my future plans
I'm still trying to get into your pants
I know
I should be letting it go

But something sticks in the way you laugh
Smiling through your dad's baseball cap
I know
I should be letting it go

Then i wonder how I'm feeling so old
I can't believe that we're all so

Grown

Everybody's changing and they're moving away
I kissed you hardest on the moving day
You went cold
The only time that august froze

You said you'd visit every chance that you got
Now somebody tells me that you're moving on
I know
I should be letting it go

But then i wonder how i'm feeling so old
Will we still know each other when were both

Grown
