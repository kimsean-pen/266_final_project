Pack your grip
Takin you on a trip
Ain't no seats
All we got's dancin' feet

Leave your worries behind
(leave your worries behind)
'Cause rain, shine don't mind
We're ridin' on the groove line tonight (whowa whowa) (whowa whowa)

Get this train
Know you'll be glad you came
Hit the track
Party hard there and back

Leave your worries behind
(leave your worries behind)
'Cause rain, shine don't mind
We're ridin' on the groove line tonight (whowa whowa) (whowa whowa)

Check out the wheels a turnin' (who-e-uu)
You know we won't stop
We got this boiler burnin' (who-e-uu)
We're keepin' it hot
So grab your friends
Get the train comin' through
Climb on board
Where you leave's up to you

Leave your worries behind
