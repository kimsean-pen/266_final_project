My friend
You're always the last one to leave those dimly lit rooms
Making sure the last glass makes it's way to the table empty
And every bottle in the place has been upside down
At least a few times
What a waste
Is this what's left of you these days?

You're not 18 anymore
5 years should have been enough time
For you to grow up and get over this
It's not too cool
To be throwing up all morning
Sick from what you might have done or done it with

I swear
If I could take your pain and frame it and hang it on my wall
Maybe you wouldnever have to hurt at all
I'm painting pictures in red and blue
A portrait bruised just like you
And now you're walking away

You're not 18 anymore
5 years should have been enough time
For you to grow up and get over this
It's not too cool
To be throwing up all morning
Sick from what you might have done

When is enough finally enough?
All the hang-ups and heartbreaks get you past.
All failures and bad breaks
Just accept yourself
Find something that brings you closer to complete

Painting pictures in red and blue
A portrait bruised just like you
And now you're walking away

You're not 18 anymore
5 years should have been enough time
For you to grow up and get over this
It's not too cool
To be throwing up all morning
Sick from what you might have done or done it with

When is enough finally enough?
