Never give up
Yeah, yeah
Never give up

The tide is high
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kinda girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh, no

It's not the things you do
That tease and hurt me back
But it's the way you do the things
You do to me
I'm not the kinda girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one

Number one (oh number one)
Number one

Every girl wants
You to be her man
But I'll wait right here
'Til it's my turn
I'm not the kinda girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high (the tide is high)
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one

Number one (oh number one)
Number one

Everytime that I get the feeling
You give me something to believe in
Everytime that I got you near me
I know the way that
I want it to be

But you know that I'm gonna take my chance now
I'm gonna make it happen somehow
And you know I can take the pressure
A moments pain for a lifetime pleasure

Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait right here
'Til it's my turn
I'm not the kinda girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one

Everytime that I get the feeling
You give me something to believe in
Everytime that I got you near me
I know the way that
I want it to be

But you know that I'm gonna take my chance now
I'm gonna make it happen somehow
And you know I can take the pressure
A moments pain for a lifetime pleasure

The tide is hide
But I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
