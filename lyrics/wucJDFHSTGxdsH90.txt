Gonna bake and make your dinner
I'll be your cook
You can bring me home the bacon
And chop the wood

Steal my blood and steal my heart
Whatever it takes to get you off
I'm your bitch, you're my bitch
(Boom, boom)
In my bones and in my soul
Always be in your control
I'm your bitch, you're my bitch
(Boom, boom)

Give me that stuff that feels so pure
Stamp me with your signature
I'm your bitch, you're my bitch
(Boom, boom)
We do things a different way
It's up to you and it's up to me
I'm your bitch, you're my bitch
(Boom, boom)

Make the bed and do your laundry
Tuck the corners in
Read the news, the business section
Tell me how it's been

Steal my blood and steal my heart
Whatever it takes to get you off
I'm your bitch, you're my bitch
(Boom, boom)
In my bones and in my soul
Always be in your control
I'm your bitch, you're my bitch
(Boom, boom)

Give me that stuff that feels so pure
Stamp me with your signature
I'm your bitch, you're my bitch
(Boom, boom)
We do things a different way
It's up to you and it's up to me
I'm your bitch, you're my bitch
(Boom, boom)

Give me something to run to it
Let me know
Tell me to go
Let's take the long way through the crowd
Only forsure
Nobody's sat at me and stared
Oh well, oh well
