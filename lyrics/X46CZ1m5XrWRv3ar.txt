Late night, I try to focus on the blurred lights
Neon signs and my hands are freezing
Snow blind with my head down with the wind in my eyes
This icy road stares back
There's only so much hope when every place I go
Reminds me I'll never get back home
But there's no time, I look up into headlights
The screeching tires seem to call my name

I deserve this, it's all true
I'm burning up
Everything you said hit me like a car wreck

Face down on the cold ground
Slipping away as the past comes back
I'm face down on the cold ground
Slipping away as it fades to black

Whiplash, a thousand thoughts converge on impact
A cry for help
But there's no one left and the silence wins again
I'm barely breathing as they call my name

I deserve this, it's all true
I'm burning up
Everything you said hit me like a car wreck

Face down on the cold ground
Slipping away as the past comes back
I'm face down on the cold ground
Slipping away as it fades to black

But in the pouring rain
I never felt like that, you said you felt the same
Can't spend another day here
I keep looking back as you're looking away

Everything you said hit me like a car wreck
Everything-everything you said hit me like a car wreck
I'm no better than bad luck
Walk away while you can
Walk away while you can
Turn the page then nail the book shut
Just walk away while you can
Just walk away while you can
Just walk away

Face down on the cold ground
Slipping away as the past comes back
I'm face down on the cold ground
Slipping away as it fades to black

But in the pouring rain
I never felt like that, you said you felt the same
Can't spend another day here
I keep looking back as you're looking away

Just walk away while you can
Just walk away while you can
