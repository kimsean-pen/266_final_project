I think I'm going crazy
Just about to lose my mind

I think I'm going crazy
Just about to lose my mind

You know my woman left me all alone
Enough to make a man go blind

I've got to shut the door behind me
Go out and buy some highway shoes

I've got to shut the door behind me
Go out and buy some highway shoes

'Cause I swear I'm sick and tired
Singing these Lost Woman Blues

Shake it up

Woke up this morning
All my life was broken down

Woke up this morning
All my life was broken down

And if I'm gonna find that woman
I'm gonna have to leave this town

Hey

Gonna bring her home

A bad situation
Ain't gonna bring me down

A bad disputation
Ain't gonna turn me around

I woke up with morning

All I could do is moan

One man use her
One man abused her
She took it out
She took it out
She took it all out on me
