There was a place, a little town
Where we used to play and laugh around
We went too far, reaching for that star
And the light moved away from me

And the spirit never died, the world belongs to me
This is when I've been given time to live and see

I'll never give up, never give in
Won't stop believing, 'cause I'm gonna win
Sing with my soul before I get old
'Cause there may be no tomorrow
There is no limit to what can be done
Climbing the mountain with power so strong
Dusty roads, down the way
Leaving the future behind me

I got a fast car like a rock star
Come and join the ride with me
Take a spin downtown
Check out who's around
I'll show you where you wanna be

And the spirit never dies
Let the music take you higher
I know what it means to burn
That's how I began to learn

So never give up, never give in
Rise from the fire if you're gonna win
Sing with your soul, soon you'll be old
Fight the demons inside you
There is no limit to what can be done
Climb every mountain with power so strong
Dusty roads on the way, leaving the past behind you

I've seen love in vain
I have felt the pain
Torn in desire
Lead by the fire
And as I lived it all, the world became too small
And my colors grew colder

The spirit takes me higher

Never give up, never give in
Won't stop believing cause I'm gonna win
Sing with my soul before I get old
What if there's no tomorrow
There is no limit to what can be done
Climbing the mountain with power so strong
Dusty roads, down the way
Leaving the memories behind me

Use the spirit
