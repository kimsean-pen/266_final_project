What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Are you waiting on a lightning strike?
Are you waiting for the perfect night?
Are you waiting till the time is right?
What are you waiting for?

Don't you want to learn to deal with fear?
Don't you want to take the wheel and steer?
Don't you wait another minute here
What are you waiting for?

What are you waiting for?
You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you've got
You're only livin' once, so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?

You know you've got to give it your all
And don't you be afraid, if you fall
You're only livin' once, so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?

Are you waiting for the right excuse?
Are you waiting for a sign to choose?
While you're waiting it's the time you lose
What are you waiting for?

Don't you want to spread your wings and fly?
Don't you really wanna live your life?
Don't you want to love before you die?
What are you waiting for?

What are you waiting for?
You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you've got
You're only livin' once, so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?

And don't you be afraid if you fall
You're only livin' once, so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?

Tell me, what you're waiting for
(Tell me, tell me, what you're waiting for)
Show me, what you're aiming for

So, what you're really waiting for?
(So, what you're really waiting for?)

Everybody's going to make mistakes
But everybody's got a choice to make
Everybody needs a leap of faith
