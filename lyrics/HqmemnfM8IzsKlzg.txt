If you're thinking you'll cheat on me
And if you're thinking I wanna wanna
See me take that fall, best heed this wake up call
Cause I got a brother, he's got a gun
I bet that you don't wanna wanna
Use me for your fun
I'm not some hit and run

I got a problem, got a girl who really ain't much fun
I got a girl who's got a brother who threatens with a gun
I'm running out I'm running out of options this is true
So I know now what I must do

You can lick my balls you can eat my shit
If I had the nerve I'd throttle throttle
Your carcass to the wall
Will see who takes the fall
You had a brother now I got a gun
I ease down on the throttle throttle
It was so much fun
Now he's the hit and run

I got a problem, got a girl who really ain't much fun
I got a girl who's got a brother who threatens with a gun
I'm running out I'm running out of options this is true
So I know now what I must do

I'm finding satisfaction of what's before my eyes
The bruises on her arms and legs doubled in size
Like milk our love went sour
I wish you lots of luck
I use to call you sweet pea
Now you're shit out go luck

I got a problem, got a girl who really ain't much fun
I got a girl who's got a brother who threatens with a gun
I'm running out I'm running out of options this is true
So I know now what I must do
