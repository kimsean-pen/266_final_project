I set my sail
Fly, the wind it will take me
Back to my home, sweet home

Lie on my back
Clouds are makin' way for me
I'm comin' home, sweet home

I see
Your star
You left it burnin' for me
Mother, I'm here

Eyes open wide
Feel your heart and it's glowin'
I'm welcome home, sweet home

I take your hand
Now you'll never be lonely
Not when I'm home, sweet home

I see
Your star
You left it burnin' for me
Mother, I'm here
