Get your motor running
California interstate 1
Pacific coast party
If you got to work today
Get yourself a new vocation
Pacific coast party
You don't have to mind father time mother nature
Get yourself in line
Take your time
And watch it slip away
Just quit your bitching, bite your tongue
Save it for a rainy day, son
Pacific coast party
Get your ticket pack your bags
Come and join the celebration
Pacific coast party
If you want a fine piece of mind
Come and get it
Get yourself in line
Take your time
And watch it slip away...
Pacific coast party

Hey I heard somebody say
Work harder than you play
But I never missed a single's days party
Word?, I never heard a word
I turn the other way
Pacific coast party

Interlude - guitar solo

You don't have to mind father time mother nature
Get yourself in line
Take your time
And watch it slip away...

Hey I heard somebody say
Work harder than you play
But I never missed a single's day's party
Word?, I never heard a word
I turn the other way, ooh
Pacific coast party

Hey I heard somebody say
