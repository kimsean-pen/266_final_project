Oh Jesus,
Oh Jesus,
You're my only god.
Oh Jesus,
Oh Jesus,
You're my only firl.
I follow you now.
I'll follow you down,
To a dirty black room,
Where the air is gone.
I'll lie down on the table,
And I'll wait for you,
To step inside me now.
Step inside me now.
Come on,
Come on in.
Oh Jesus Christ,
You're my only,
My only God...
If I drink your blood,
I will be like you.
Girl, I want to be like you.
I'll look into your eyes,
And close my mind.
Get out of my mind.
Get out of my head.
Oh Jesus,
Oh Jesus,
You're my only God...
