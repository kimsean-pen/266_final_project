Love After War...
Love After War...
Love After War...

Oooh ooh oh yeah
Oooh it's a knock-out baby, you want the fight
I said I'm sorry that I acted like a selfish child
Please forgive me baby, I was out of line
You know I can make it right

Don't you love it when we fight
Love After War...
I need you tonight baby
Love After War...
Come on and let me make it right baby
Love After War...
I'm knockin on your door
Love After War...

You know I want it, you know I want ya
Cuddle up, doors, clap, door slams and broken lights
Bottles hit the TV screen
You got to go, or I'm gonna leave
Throwing clothes into the yard
When we go we go so hard

It only makes me want you more, more, more
Love After War...
I need you tonight baby
Love After War...
Come on and let me make it right baby
Love After War...
I'm knockin on your door
Love After War...

You know I want it
Don't you leave
That's all we need...
all we need

Thats all we need
Love After War...
I just wanna love you lady
Love After War...
Wanna put down our weapons baby
Love After War...
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Love After War...

And give me some love after war
Love After War...
You know it's gonna be your night baby
Love After War...
You know the way that we fight baby
Love After War...
Just drink this glass of wine
Love After War...
And girl remember you're mine
Love After War...
Remember you're mine babe, you're mine baby
Love After War...
Come on and let me in
Love After War...
Let me let me in
Love After War...
You know I want it, you know I want you baby
You know I want you baby
You know I want you baby
