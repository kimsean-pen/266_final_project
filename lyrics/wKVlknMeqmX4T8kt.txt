You're there to watch me crumble

I feel so empty and alone, I wonder
If this is ever going to go away
'Cause now this changes everything

Smash all your sacred cows
Break all your sacred vows
Never look down on me
What you get, what you see
I could never be another brick in the wall

You'll remember me
As you break all our spirits down
And push us to the ground
Call me a fool with a gasoline can
Burn it fucking down
Start it over and over again

Whenever I fall
If ever at all
You're there to watch me crumble
And just like a muse
A drug I abuse
You're there to watch me crumble
But you won't get your chance

And so I sink into the grey horizon
I'm never going to let you say I can't
I'll never let you beat me to the ground
So can you see the hunger in my eyes?
Take a look, it's no disguise
Got to crush my struggles
Crush the pain and the strife
Live or die, I'm gonna fight for my life tonight

Whenever I fall
If ever at all
You're there to watch me crumble
And just like a muse
A drug I abuse
You're there to watch me crumble
But you won't get your chance
You'll never get your chance

The only thing keeping me sane
The music in my veins
And if these words are my fists
Can you feel my catharsis?
Can you feel my catharsis
Come on
Can you feel my catharsis

The only thing keeping me sane
The music in my veins
And if these words are my fists
This is my catharsis

Whenever I fall
If ever at all
You're there to watch me crumble
And just like a muse
A drug I abuse
You're there to watch me crumble

Whenever I fall
If ever at all
You're there to watch me crumble
And just like a muse
A drug I abuse
You're there to watch me crumble

But you won't get your chance
You'll never get your chance

The only thing keeping me sane
The music in my veins
And if these words are my fists
Can you feel my catharsis?
Can you feel my catharsis
Come on
Can you feel my catharsis

The only thing keeping me sane
The music in my veins
And if these words are my fists
This is my catharsis
