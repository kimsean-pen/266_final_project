I wanna dance!

Clocks strikes upon the hour and the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out how to chase my blues away
I've done alright up till now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, my lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses, spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends and I wind up feeling down
I need a woman who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls, my lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
(Somebody who, somebody who)

Somebody who loves me, yeah
(Somebody who, somebody who)
To hold me in her arms, oh

I need a woman who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last

So when the night falls, my lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Ohhhh, ohhhh (Dance!)
Come on baby, hahahaha (Dance!)

Ooh!
Yeah! (Dance!)

With somebody who loves me
Don't you wanna dance, say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance? (Dance!)
Don't you wanna dance, say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance? (Dance!)
Don't you wanna dance
Say you wanna dance?
Uh huh (Dance!)
With somebody who loves me
