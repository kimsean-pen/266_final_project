If it can be broke then it can be fixed
If it can be fused then it can be split
It's all under control, it's all under control
It's all under control, it's all under control

If it can be lost then it can be won
If it can be touched then it can be turned
All you need is time, all you need is time
All you need is time, all you need is time
All you need is time

If it can be broke then it can be fixed
If it can be fused then it can be split
It's all under control, it's all under control
It's all under control, it's all under control

If it can be lost then it can be won
If it can be touched then it can be turned
All you need is time, all you need is time
All you need is time, all you need is

We promised the world we'd tame it
What we're hiding for?
We promised the world we'd tame it
What we're hoping for?

We promised the world we'd tame it
What we're hoping for?
We promised the world we'd tame it
What we're hoping for?

A sense of purpose and a sense of skill
A sense of function but a disregard
We will not be the first, we will not be the first
We will not be the first, we will

We said we've going to conquer new frontiers
Go stick your bloody head in the jaws of the beast

We promised the world we'd tame it
What we're hoping for?
We promised the world we'd tame it
What we're hoping for?

We promised the world we'd tame it
What we're hoping for?
We promised the world we'd tame it
What we're hoping for?

Breath in, breath out
Breath in, breath out
Breath in, breath out
Breath in

So here we are reinventing the wheel
I'm shaking hands with a hurricane
It's a color that I can't describe
It's a language I can't understand
Ambition, tearing out the heart of you
Carving lines into you, dripping down the sides of you

We will not be the last
We will not be the last
We will not be the last
