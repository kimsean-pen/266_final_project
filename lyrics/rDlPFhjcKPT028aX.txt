You took me on, you forced my hand again
Holding the rope, holding everything
Only the bravest girl would sit through this
Only the darkest German confidence

I guess if I'm breathing this is not the end
I guess if I love myself I have a friend
Oh and if there's nothing left I have your voice
Talking me into sleep, into the void

We laid in the sand, the salt breeze in our eyes
Telling our stories with unspoken signs
Waves of old tension still controlling us
Waves of a new life slowly calming us
