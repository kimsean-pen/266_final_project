The surface is so cold and worthless
All the things that I have still come from there
So paint the windows in front of my face
When you know damn well there's
No one behind them!

I wish your body was not so warm to me
I wish your body was not so warm to me
I wish your body was not so warm to me
Just so you know

And all it was was something beautiful
When tides and dreams don't seem so tall at all
And all it was was something beautiful
When tides and dreams don't seem so tall at all

It's me against the world, still I'm losing ground
And I'd kill to taste what it must be like
'Cause it's every one of my empty parts
That you fill, now

I wish your body was not so warm to me
I wish your body was not so warm to me
I wish your body was not so warm to me
Just so you know

Yeah, and maybe it's all for the better now
Yeah, well maybe things seldom make sense
Yeah, and maybe it's all for the better now
Yeah, well maybe things seldom make sense

And all it was was something beautiful
When tides and dreams don't seem so tall at all
And all it was was something beautiful
When tides and dreams don't seem so tall at all

Pause, silence
Another moment dropped off
Left behind
And hanging still

Pause, silence
Another moment dropped off
Left behind
And hanging still

You won't see me
You won't see me
You won't see me
You won't see me

I can't see you
I can't see you
I can't see you
I can't see you

(And all it was was something...)

And all it was was something beautiful
When tides and dreams don't seem so tall at all
And all it was was something beautiful
When tides and dreams don't seem so tall at all
