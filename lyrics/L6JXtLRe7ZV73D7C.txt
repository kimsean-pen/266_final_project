Oh Tell me
What we're gonna do?
I wanna know baby
How we're gonna pull through?
I see trouble
All down the line
Some of us work too hard
Others tread a fine line
I'm getting tired of this politeness
I want what you've got
Or I'll just turn my back tonight
And I'll say thanks alot, for nothing
If I don't get lucky baby
Remember you don't get lucky too

Baby
Will this last, last for long?
I wanna know baby
What did I do wrong?
Do you want me to cry baby
Like a so-called new man?
If I was a woman baby
Maybe I'd understand
You're missing out on such a good thing
But you don't seem to care
All this love I've got inside
Has got to go somewhere somehow
If I don't get lucky baby you don't get lucky too
If we don't make love then it's over baby
Me and you got to try sometimes
If we don't work tonight
Then we just ain't right
If I don't get some baby
You don't get lucky too
Woh baby
If I don't get lucky baby
You don't get lucky too
Sha-la-la la-la
I don't think you understand me baby
Let me explain
You ain't goin' get some
This evenin'
Oh baby
I been waiting so long
Gonna take the initiative
You see it builds up inside
Something's got to give
Sometimes I got to school you
Too much time
Why waste my time
(I can't stand it)
(Lucky)
