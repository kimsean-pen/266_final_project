[Ad-Rock:]
Now, it suffice, to say that I'm nicer
Nice in the cut, and yes I'm the slicer
Or should I say, I'm the filet-er
I hate the game, I hate the puh-layer
But don't get discombobulated and upset
Because trust me, we ain't even begun yet
[Chorus:]
Mike D has gotta rock it we rock it non-stop
Ad-Rock down, rock it we rock it non-stop
MCA gotta rock we rock it non-stop
And you don't stop, the body rock
[Mike D:]
Watch me make the fire, now I make it sizzle
As I flip your omelette, at the D Pizzle
Like Molto Mario, they call me taster D
Or a quick fire challenge put that [?] on G.D.
You can, [?] and fortified
Not squares on the block and not taken for a ride
[Chorus:]
Mike D gotta rock and we rock it non-stop
Ad-Rock gotta rock and we rock it non-stop
MCA gotta rock and we rock it non-stop
And then you don't stop, the body rock
[MCA:]
Got things [?] bubblin up and they're out of my hands
And I don't never claim that sounds too grand
Shazam! I sprinkle on some magic dust
You gotta be the one to dance, and that's a must
Yes I cuss, when I grab my nuts
Got a six finger demon says excuse our dust
[Totally distorted]
Mike D's gotta rock and we rock it non-stop
Ad-Rock's gotta rock and we rock it non-stop
MCA's gotta rock and we rock it non-stop
And you don't stop, for what, to what
