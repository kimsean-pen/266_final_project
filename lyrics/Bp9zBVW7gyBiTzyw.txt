I made a few mistakes
I don't worry anymore
Well, you never could relate
But I don't hate you anymore, oh no

'Cause summer's in the air now
I gotta get my game down tight, it's alright
Yo, go and get the word out
We're gonna rock this party tonight, it's alright

I never meant to hurt you, girl, you know
You never felt the winter quite so cold
But when the sun comes up I'll still be around
'Cause it's summer time, get down

Get up, get up to get down, get down
Get up, get up to get down, get down

We're blasting Warren G
Regulators cruising slow
Roll down the windows, man
We gotta let them suckers know, oh, oh

That summer's in the air now
We gotta get our moves down tight, it's alright
You gotta feel the beat now
The heart is what I see but you know how to rock all night

I never meant to hurt you, girl, you know
You never felt the winter quite so cold
But when the sun comes up I'll still be around
'Cause it's summer time, get down

Get up, get up to get down, get down
Get up, get up to get down, down
You gotta get up, get up to get down, down
'Cause it's summer time, get down

All my friends are in the city
Gonna be the best summer
We'll catch a ride out of the city
If you catch a case of summer time blues

Telephone all the pretty girls you know
We don't need nowhere to go
We can drive around all night long

I never meant to hurt you, girl, you know
You never felt the winter quite so cold
But when the sun comes up I'll still be around
'Cause it's summer time, get down

I never meant to hurt you, girl, you know
You never felt the winter quite so cold
But when the sun comes up I'll still be around
'Cause it's summer time, get down

Get up, get up to get down, get down
Get up, get up to get down, down
You gotta get up, get up
You gotta get up, get up to get, get down
