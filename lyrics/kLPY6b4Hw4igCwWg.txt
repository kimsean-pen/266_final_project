Somehow I came to realize
That life was more than just a game
Unconsciousness have ruled my life
'Til now I never had to care
It's time to grow, time to react

Dreaming while my life carries on
And I stay behind
يــاليلـي يــاعيــن
Stay behind
يــاليلـي يــاعيــن
I know now that the time is not on my side
And it runs I know
يــاليلـي يــاعيــن
Yes it runs
يــاليلـي يــاعيــن

Some things for sure will come to change
I came across with too much pain
I pulled myself together again
I can't believe, I cannot fail
I can't delay, it's time to start

Dreaming while my life carries on
And I stay behind
يــاليلـي يــاعيــن
Stay behind
يــاليلـي يــاعيــن
I know now that the time is not on my side
And it runs I know
يــاليلـي يــاعيــن
Yes it runs
يــاليلـي يــاعيــن

Dreaming while my life carries on
And I stay behind
يــاليلـي يــاعيــن
Stay behind
يــاليلـي يــاعيــن
I know now that the time is not on my side
And it runs I know
يــاليلـي يــاعيــن
Yes it runs
يــاليلـي يــاعيــن
