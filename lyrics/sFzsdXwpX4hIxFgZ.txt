Just open up like a page in a book
These words that I'm writing won't be misunderstood
If I'm dishonest bring me back to my knees
Show me why I'm even able to speak
I'll testify please help me to see
Don't close your eyes, keep your eyes on me

Open up, open up now so make me strong
There's blood on my hands,
And the killers not my enemy
It's all for the sake of love,
It's all for you

When all we know is falling I'll save something for you,
You who are all alone
(All alone)
When everything is beautiful, when everything's okay
Even if it's not okay I'll say it's all for you
For you, for you,
For you, for you,

For you and only you (only you)

These hands hold up nothing but scars underneath (scars underneath)
From swimming these oceans and learning to breathe (learning to breathe)
So often I tell them so often they listen to me
So make me strong

There's blood on my hands,
And the killers not my enemy
It's all for the sake of love,
It's all for you

When all we know is falling I'll save something for you,

You who are all alone
(All alone)
When everything is beautiful, when everything's okay
Even if it's not okay I'll say it's all for you
For you, for you,
For you, for you,
For you and only you

I can tell it in my fingertips oh,
I can feel
And I can taste it in the air
And I'm hoping there's someway I can follow
I know somehow there's something new,
I see it so clearly
I can feel your hands on my fingertips
I'm seeing oh so clear
I know it's for you
I see it so clear
(It's all for you)

When all we know is falling I'll save something for you,
You who are all alone
(All alone)
When everything is beautiful, when everything's okay
Even if it's not okay I'll say it's all for you
For you, for you
