I spend the night in a chair
Thinkin' she'll be there
But she never comes
And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes
And I rise to face another day
Without her
Too-doo-doo
Too-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

It's just no good anymore
When you walk through the door
Of an empty room
And you go inside and set a table for one
It's no fun
When you spend a day
Without her
Too-doo-doo
Too-doo-doo-doo

Doo-doo-doo

We burst a pretty balloon
Took us to the moon
Such a beautiful thing
But it's ended now
And it sounds like a lie
If I said I'd rather die
Than live without her
Too-doo-doo

Too-doo-doo
Too-doo-doo

Love is a beautiful thing
When it knows how to swing
And it grooves like a clock
But the hands on the cock
Tell the lovers to part
And it's breaking my heart
To have to spend another day
Without her

Too-doo-doo
Too-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo

I spend the night in a chair
Thinkin' she'll be there
But she never comes
And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes

And I rise to face another day
Without her
Too-doo-doo
Too-doo-doo-doo

Can't go on without her
Doo-doo-doo
Too-doo-doo-doo
There's no song without her
It's all wrong without her
Can't go on without her
