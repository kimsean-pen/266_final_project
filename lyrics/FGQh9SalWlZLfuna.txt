There is no doubt about it
I'm one of a kind, baby
I am le d'Artagnan de coeur
As you may see, candy

And I'm talkin with my eyes
And I walk in different styles
I'm the genuine man!
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman

Kneel down, inhale my odor
Come, kiss my hand, angel
Dare to explore my higher
grounds
Strive to deserve me
ma cherie
And my winds
surpass perfume

I'm charismatic at full bloom
I'm the genuine man!
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
Yes I am, I am, yes I am
(perfect)

SOLO

Oh Lord, what can I do
I can't resist my own
reflection
How would possibly anyone?
Cause I am (perfect)
Yes I am (perfect)
Oh Lord I am (perfect)
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
Yes I am
I am a perfect gentleman
