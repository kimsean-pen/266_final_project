Ooh-ooh, bet you wondered how I knew
'Bout your plan to make me blue
With some other guy that you knew before
Between the two of us guys, you know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday

Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

You know that a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you'd end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could've told me yourself
That you found someone else

Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

People say you hurt from what you see
Nah-nah-not from what you hear
I can't help but bein' confused
If it's true, won't you tell me here?
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy that you knew before?

Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind

Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah
