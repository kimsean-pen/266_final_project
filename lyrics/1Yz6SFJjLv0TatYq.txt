To think that I would die this time
Isolated in the room where the bed rises
Photographic ordinary people are everywhere
Extraordinary histories, ordinary histories, ordinary histories

I'll find sleep, I'll find peace
Or in death you'll sleep with me
To figure that it was my fault
Or so I've come to realize life is not about
Love with someone
(ordinary people are everywhere)
Extraordinary people are, ordinary people are, ordinary people are

Everywhere you look, everywhere you turn
Illness is watching, waiting its turn

Did I go at it wrong?
Did I go intentionally to destroy me?
I'm suffering in noise I'm suffering in
(touching ordinary bodies)
The burning from within the burning from with
(ordinary hysteria)
I could not be at rest, I could not be at peace (extraordinary hysteria)

So do yourself a good, or do yourself a death from ordinary causes
Or do yourself a favor, or do yourself a death from ordinary causes

Illness likes to prey upon the lonely,
prey upon the lonely
Wave goodbye, oh, I would rather be,
but I would rather be fine

I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well...

And I forgive you even
As you choke me that way
With the pill or demon
And the shrouded shalom
Under conversation
In tremendous weight of
A crowd of ages outside
Dressed for murder

I'm not fucking around
(well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around
(well, I want to be well, I want to be)

And shall I kiss you even
As you take me that way?
With the pill or demon
As my body changes
Apparitions gone awry
They surround me, all sides
But from within I see an unholy change

I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around
(well, I want to be well, I want to be)
