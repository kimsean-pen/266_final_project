You can kill the lights, you can draw the blinds
My heart's shackled down, bound to your bed
Can you stay a while, keep me by your side?
Feel my scattered heart, fix me, I said

We could lay here underneath the river
If you stay, if you stay
We could sleep here underneath the river
If you stay, if you stay, we could go home

We could go home
Down below, low, low
Nobody knows where we will go
Down below, low, low

Can we stay inside, lay here by the fire?
Please don't let me go, say it ain't so
Leave me in the night with no warning sign
Are we burning out? Mirrors and smoke

We could lay here underneath the river
If you stay, if you stay
We could sleep here underneath the river
If you stay, if you stay, we could go home

We could go home
Down below, low, low
Nobody knows where we will go
Down below, low, low

We could lay here underneath the river
If you stay, if you stay
We could sleep here underneath the river
If you stay, if you stay, we could go home

We could go home
Down below, low, low
Nobody knows (nobody knows) where we will go (we will go)
Down below, low, low
We could go home
Down below, low, low
Nobody knows (nobody knows) where we will go
Down below, low, low
