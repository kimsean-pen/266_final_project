Seed of doubt
It exists
And it grows
A glimpse of life from somewhere deep within
Awake and understand

Is there anyone else here, somebody's screaming
Please help me
Let's find out now that I am not dreaming
Welcome to my damnation
Here it comes, the real me

I didn't know, I couldn't hear the answer
My mind was blank, I should've known
Hold it back but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me
Another stranger me
That's when the ice will break away

I can't get out of here anymore
Cause none of my keys fit the door
There's fear and anger, hate and love
I must confess it's out of hand

It's physic
It's cynic
Still cynic, all my laughter
It's cynic
Just manic
It's cynic, all her laughter

If there's anyone in, it soon will be over
We'll burn out
Our soul's aflamed, we're on our own now
Give up you cruel invasion
You're insane I'll show you

I didn't know, I couldn't hear the answer
My mind was blank, I should've known
Hold it back but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me

Out and gone
Can't resist
Cold and sore
The bolt of pain keeps ripping through my head
I can take no more

Don't tell anyone else I do not believe her
She hates me
Cloud my mind, she's a deceiver
I can feel cruel vibrations
Would you like to meet me

I didn't know, I couldn't hear the answer
My mind was blank, I should've known
Hold it back but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me
Another stranger me
