Come on out
Come on out in this light
Satellites can't see what's inside
Unlock the door; it won't save you anymore
Governments can't fight what's inside

Show some signs of life
Show some signs of life
Show some signs of life

Come on down
Come on down from these heights
Others bled to give you the right
Understand the choice, they don't even hear your voice
But governments can't fight what's inside
What's inside?

Show some signs of life
Show some signs of life
Show some signs of life

And come down and put your heart in this fight
Ah, come on and make your stand tonight
Show some signs of life And come down and put your heart in this fight
Ah, come on and make your stand tonight
