Petr hes cryin out from his room again. Peers under
the doors crack, he wonders which side be his sin. Spring himself
and Grandfater each from their own traps, six inches under the
door same as window cracks.

Its a mad mad way hes living, thats his destiny.
Its a mad mad way hes living, I bare witness on thee.

Grandfater is falling out of the room again. Cant spring himself
from this trap Petr put him in. Grandfater peering out of the
window high, Grandfater lets out an old man cry.

Its a bad dad way hes living, thats his destiny.
Its a bad dad way hes living, I bare witness on thee.

Three Hunters they are coming to this land again. They wander
through the Wandering, mountains, and ocean. They dont give
heed to three birds a different hunt they seek, not themselves,
bird, duck, or geese.

Its a glad glad way they re living, thats their destiny.
Its a glad glad way they re living, I bare witness on thee.

The Wulf he be screaming from his wood again. Laughing at the Hunters who
come to do him in. The Wulf he is a coming head on to-wards me, he aint afraid
of this Scarebeast.

Its a cad cad way hes living, thats his destiny.
Its a cad cad way he's living, I bare witness on thee.

This town it is falling down, down into the sea, mountains they are heaving
up all Lupercali. Closer comes the Wandering six inches every day, one day
this place will fades away.

Its a sad sad way were living, thats our destiny.
Its a sad sad way were living, I bare witness on thee.
Its a sad sad way were living, thats our destiny.
Its a sad sad way were living, in Lupercali!
