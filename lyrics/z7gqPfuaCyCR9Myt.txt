Numb
No longer afraid
Numb
Disinhibited

Dead on my feet
I'm always walking towards the exit
No good deed unpunished
No encouragement

I get tired of the things i claim to love
I get tired of the thing that i've become

Every good thing in my life
Comes at someone else's expense

Numb
No longer afraid
Numb
Disinhibited

Wake up and say something
Do something, make something
Pretend to feel something
Wait for the day to end
The problem with giving a shit
Is no one thanks you
And they always want more
I wish i had done
Something else
With my life

I get tired of trying to convince myself
Not to pull the trigger
Not to turn out the light
