Drinking, drugged up, completely shot to hell
Left behind, ain't nothing left to sell
Oh, ain't nothing left to sell

The hatred of your blood, so tortured, so insane
Dead ends and lost hope keep running through your veins
Oh, running through your veins

Oh, so high and then I fell
Oh, can't stop the ringing of my funeral bell

The loss of one's self inside the wheel of doom
Genocide is coming way too soon
Oh, way too soon

The undying fear, the strength of one's demise
Broke and strung out, you wave yourself goodbye
Oh, goodbye

Oh, so high and then I fell
Oh, can't stop the ringing
Oh, so high and then I fell
Oh, can't stop the ringing of my funeral bell

Oh, so high and then I fell
Oh, can't stop the ringing
Oh, so high and then I fell
Oh, can't stop the ringing of my funeral bell
