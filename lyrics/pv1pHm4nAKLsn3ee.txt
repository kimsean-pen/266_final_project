I'm trying to replace
All of my heartstrings
But going gets boring
So you get going

I need you more than you need me
But who am I to blame
If it isn't meant to be?

And I've felt this way
For so Goddamn long
Reach for your heart
Knowing I won't

I need to confess
All of my secrets
Your smile eyes are
My only weakness

Problems are mine
By design
Our blood pumps in time
You and I

And I've felt this way
For so Goddamn long
Reach for your heart
Knowing I won't

You broke my heart
And so did I
You and me
I and I

And I've felt this way
For so Goddamn long
Reach for your heart
Knowing I won't
