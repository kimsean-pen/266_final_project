A House of red light
Burns like your wanting eyes
The rain is away
And we say
When we say
We will play with fire (Fire)
We will play with fire (Fire)

And Every night, the red lights
Will burn like your eyes
Our time is never
Cause we'll live forever
We will play with fire (Fire)
We will play with fire (Fire)

We will play with fire (Fire Fire Fire Fire)
We will play with fire
We will play with fire (Fire)
We will play with fire
