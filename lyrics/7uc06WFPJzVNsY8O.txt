When dreaming
I'm guided to another world
Time and time again

At sunrise, I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape

From the life I live when I'm awake
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams

But my friend
I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same

The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets

So let's go there (so let's go there)
Let's go there (Let's go there)
Come on, let's go there (come on let's go there)
Let's ask can we stay

Up higher, I feel like I'm
Alive for the very first time
Said up high, I'm strong enough
To take these dreams
And make them mine

Said up high, I'm strong enough
To take these dreams
And make them mine

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets
