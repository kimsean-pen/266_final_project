When I get the time
I'd like to sit down
and write a little rhyme for you
Just a couple few
I'd tell you
What you mean to me

Yeah!

When I get the time
I'd love to sit down and write a little rhyme for you
Just a couple few
I'd tell you
What you mean to me
When I get the time
I'd
Put it all down and pick you up
I'd say
throw it all away
the world is
me and you tonight

And will there come a day
when nothing is standing in our way?
living that dream
within your arms?
Well, I'll make it happen someday
I'll make it happen someday
I'll make it happen
I'll make it happen someday
When I get the time
I gotta get the time
yeah...

I'd look in your eyes
for places inside
I've never been
before
I gotta find somemore
and I know you don't owe me
anything
When I get the time
When I get the guts
to live my life
for me
and to do, what I wanna do
I'd be the friend that you said you once knew
or will there come a day
when we give up
and turn away
and I'd have
nothing left
nothing left except
I'd have all the time in the word
all of the time in the word
time to remember
look through the window
time to cry
Time to cry...
I gotta get the time...
Where can I find the time?
Where can I find, where can I find the time?
get the time
