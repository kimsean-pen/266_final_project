I never ever quite expected
To be with you and to need to stay
Hipnotysed, hallucinating
I was lost, trying to find my way
In the untouched sands, under all the stars
We were holding hands, then we went too far
Don't ask why
I get high, high
Touyn ari, ari im ser
siro touyn em khmel
Poison running through my veins
I think I've got insane
Touyn ari, ari im ser
Siro touyn em khmel
Drugged by your love, love
I pull, you shove
Here we are in a new dimention
In a trance that we're settling in
Speaking tongues that we never imagined
Flowing like adrenalin
Hear the rise of cries, in the endless sea
We were looking eyes, sinking to deep
Don't ask why
I get high, high
Touyn ari, ari im ser
siro touyn em khmel
Poison running through my veins
I think I've got insane
Touyn ari, ari im ser
siro touyn em khmel
Drugged by your love, love
I pull, you shove
Yes oo doo enk khentasnell
Siraharvadz jubdvell
Yes oo doo enk khentasnell
Siraharvadz jubvell
Yes oo doo enk khentasnell
Siraharvadz jubdvell
Yes oo doo enk khentasnell
Siraharvadz jubvell
Don't ask why
I get high, high
Touyn ari, ari im ser
siro touyn em khmel
Poison running through my veins
I think I've got insane
Touyn ari, ari im ser
siro touyn em khmel
Drugged by your love, love
I pull, you shove
Touyn ari, ari im ser
siro touyn em khmel
Poison running through my veins
I think I've got insane
Touyn ari, ari im ser
siro touyn em khmel
Drugged by your love, love
I pull, you shove
