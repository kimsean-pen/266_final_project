Feelin' low as I piece together my night
Where and when was I wrong am I ever right?
So I wait
Like a dog who is on his corner
Like a stray
Walk on back when I needed no one

I was wrong when I met you honey
Up above yeah I'll race you there
Only love can cure my madness
Only love is my repair
is my repair

As I go where the time's rollin' on
And I don't know where I was when it all went wrong
So I wait
Like a dog who is on his corner
Like a stray
Walk on back when I needed no one

I was wrong when I met you honey
Up above yeah I'll race you there
Only love can cure my madness
Only love is my repair
is my repair

In my head don't know what I'll do
Showed up at home and baby just told you
But it's hard and then I thought this time
You're out of sight, but you ain't out of mind
Mind

I was wrong when I met you honey
Up above yeah I'll race you there
Only love can cure my madness
Only love is my repair
is my repair
is my repair
is my repair
