Here's your new drug
Shoot it in the left eye
Feel it on the right side
No it's not love
Though it sets up shop
Behind your ribcage
Building blood clots and black holes
Like using an axe to pull
A sliver from your skin

And they say this is medicine
An overdose of oxygen
A severed head
As sedative

To be at peace would be a sin
And surely un-American
I'm breaking

Here's your new blood
Transfusion took us all night
Tell us that your all right
No it's not love
Though it feels that fire inside your vein
Burning right beneath your wrist
Begging for a razors kiss
To free it from your skin

And they say this is medicine
An overdose of oxygen
A severd head
As sedative

To be at peace would be a sin
And surely un-American
I'm breaking down

Lift the veil
It's not medicine
And my heart fails
Time and time again
