Dear diary
Want to make a new entry
Oh you wouldn't believe me
What began today
She called me
Oh, that girl from the party
And I thought she should be on TV
When I first saw her face

She said alright
What are you doing till daylight?
So I chanced it
I said dancing with you

She got legs like Beyonce
Give me the eye like Rihanna
I wanna put her on camera
Cause she drive me crazy, crazy, crazy
Don't need no game show
Or a Hollywood movie, pop-video
'Cause as long as she's next to me
I got all the girls on TV
I got all the girls on TV
I got all the girls on TV

Dear diary
We finished dinner early
And the way that she kissed me
Sent us on our way
She danced like
A professional all night
And the stars were her spotlight
The city became her stage

And I said, so
Can I buy a ticket to your show?
She said front row
If I go home with you

She got legs like Beyonce
Give me the eye like Rihanna
I wanna put her on camera
Cause she drive me crazy, crazy, crazy
Don't need no game show
Or a Hollywood movie, pop-video
'Cause as long as she's next to me
I got all the girls on TV
I got all the girls on TV
I got all the girls on TV

Like a star on a silver screen
Oh, I'm punching above my weight
We're from different sides of this street
And I know, I know, I know
Still a little mysterious
Why she taking me seriously?
