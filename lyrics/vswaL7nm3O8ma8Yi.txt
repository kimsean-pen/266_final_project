Well on a train, I met a dame
She rather handsome
We kinda look the same
She was pretty
From New York City
I'm walkin' down that old fair lane

I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so
I said, Train Kept A Rollin' all night long
Train Kept A Rollin' all night long
Train Kept A Rollin' all night long
Train Kept A Rollin' all night long
With a heave, and a ho
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no
Well, get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
Well, get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no

Well, we made a stop in Albequerque
She musta thought
I was a real cool jerk
Got off the train, and put her hands up
Lookin' so good, I couldn't let her go
But I just couldn't tell her so
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her
