What's it like to be a marble?
Did I get something in your eye?
She's a referee, and I'm lethally
Overdosed on pumpkin pie
Yes, the future is mount delicious son
But the leaf changes forms continuum
My destiny is calling me, it says
Jon Mess you should own a gun

Feel the room filling up with smoke
Billowing, billowing up, holding on for the worst, rise above

I'm all run down (Can I get a piece of that?)
I need more in my veins
(Uniquely post relapse)
To be something or the whispers start to drill (The quota and balancing act)
The pain of second place (Can I get a piece of that?)

What's it like to be an atheist?
Are you okay with suicide?
Well, it's baffling that my ears can bleed
When I see your domestic thighs
Yes, the future is kush and bubblegum
But I prefer wood to linoleum
My destiny is calling me, it says
You'll be fine if you take some Tums

I'm letting out, well I feel that I've dropped it all
I'm letting out, well I feel that I've rushed it

Don't want to pretend I'm right (I'm angry, believe it, I need this just as much as you)
No more (It's complicated)

I'm all run down (Can I get a piece of that?)
I need more in my veins
(Uniquely post relapse)
To be something or the whispers start to drill (The quota and balancing act)
The pain of second place (Can I get a piece of that?)
