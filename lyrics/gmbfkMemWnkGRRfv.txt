Something's fade away, on the ceiling is green
And just word, stars we came afraid
Afraid our world is near while the future
While they killed, turned your eyes and into green
I m surrounded by the sparks
Many flowers of the worlds
On this without story, come to me
I m your voice your soldier
stay alive
Turn my head, I see your smile

Something's fade away, on the ceiling is green
And just word, stars looking afraid
I m lost lay here in this paradise our world was blue
Come to me, of you
And I feel you re coming close
Yeah, the means come to me
flowers, always come, .it s a promise hard to keep
there s a place they couldn t reach
Start to fall
there s a place they couldn t reach
Start to fall.
