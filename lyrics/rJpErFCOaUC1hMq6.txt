Screaming your lungs out,
They put on a great show.

Peel out in your car,
Drive anywhere with me,
Don't drop me off.

Can't you see me crumbling?
Aren't you feeling on my heartbeat?
I want to hear you say,
"When I call, pick me up when I come undone."
When you're healthy,
We'll fill an empty space.

It's raining outside
But with me there's sunshine.

And you know just what they're saying,
How the world it starts its ending
When the sun comes with the morning.
Risked it all solely for me.

Can't you see me crumbling?
Aren't you feeling on my heartbeat?
I want to hear you say,
"When I call, pick me up when I come undone."
When you're healthy,
We'll fill an empty space.

Can't you see me crumbling?
Aren't you feeling on my heartbeat?
I want to hear you say,
"When I call, pick me up when I come undone."
When you're healthy,
We'll fill an empty space.

Be around when I need someone.
Pick me up when I come undone.

Can't you see me crumbling?
Aren't you feeling on my heartbeat?
I want to hear you say,
"When I call, pick me up when I come undone."
When you're healthy,
We'll fill an empty space.

Can't you see me crumbling?
Aren't you feeling on my heartbeat?
I want to hear you say,
"When I call, pick me up when I come undone."
When you're healthy,
We'll fill an empty space.

Peel out in your car.
