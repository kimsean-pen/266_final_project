Back in 1972, I didn't really know
I never really knew how we were moving
'Cause we didn't come to light this loss
Just because

1972, I barely knew of
Lights and sounds and sparkle eyes and reasons to lose
It's ok, got the cemetery goal
Beauty can't console

Life leads, eyes bless
I've got it, you need it, we want it, it's dead
House calm, wives left
We're dying here, we're dying here

I've got it, you need it, we want it, it's love
I've seen it, I've heard it, I steal it, it's death
We're dying, We're dying
We're dying

Blinking in the bright light with you
I really have to believe that everyone and everything
Just shines for the one to find this is loss
And just because

Sparkle like you would for them
Preyed upon, I prayed within
The hearth, the home, the house
The sin that waits until then
The call, the home, the shape, the dead, the centuries dying

Life leads, eyes bless
I've got it, you need it, we want it, it's dead
House calm, wives left
We're dying here, we're dying here
I've got it, you need it, we want it, it's love
I've seen it, I've heard it, I steal it, it's death
We're dying, We're dying
We're dying
