I did not take to analysis
So I had to make up my mind
And hold it for a while

I would not just leave you without a kiss
But I guess there must come a time
When there's no more tears to cry

Thieves and snakes need homes
Need homes, barricade

It starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, to keep us away
It kind of does
It starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, keep us away

I could not lean on the politics
'Cause I didn't want to train my eye
To hold so short a time

Oh so high, just don't know
Where the blind could lead the sightless
But I still like to witness

Thieves and snakes need homes
Need homes, barricade

It starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, to keep us away
It kind of does
It starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, keep us away

Full speed, half blind
Full tilt, decline
We turn to past times
Full speed, half blind

You know us
You know us
And we said
I'm sorry
Say, I'm sorry

Sometimes it feels like a barricade
To keep us away, keep us away
It kind of does
How much fear can you fabricate
To keep us away, keep us away
You know us
Full speed, half blind
Full tilt, decline
We turn to past times
Full speed, half blind
Full speed, half blind
Full tilt, decline
On to old times
Full speed, half blind
