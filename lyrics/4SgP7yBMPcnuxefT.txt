seems like falling down
or away lost at sea
or the one that's left behind
or the wake of you and me

maybe I know that
maybe it's better
but I can't forget the time

I know where I am
every day every night
like the one who knows too much
trusts the same old thing

maybe I know that
maybe it's better
but I can't forget the time

realizing nothing
I remember when

maybe I know that
maybe it's better
but I can't forget the time

maybe I know that
maybe it's better
maybe it's nothing
but I can't forget the time
