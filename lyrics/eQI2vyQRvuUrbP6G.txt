String Interlude
There's a hole in my heart...
My soul... is bleeding...
I need to free... my mind...

And see what... I'm feeling
Cause Lord knows, Lord knows

I'm...
(I'm tired)
Tired of the way he treats me
(Tired)

Tired of the guilty feelings (tired)
Tired of the broken dreams (tired)
I'm (tired) tired of the old routines
I'm (tired) tired of the Baby Mamas (tired)

Tired of the ghetto drama (tired)
Tired of the back and forth (tired)
I'm (tired) tired of in and out the courts
I'm (tired) tired of all the games and lies

I'm (tired) tired of phony alibis
I'm (tired) tired of praying that it works
I'm (tired) even tired of going to church
I'm (tired) tired of paying these bills

I'm (tired) said I'm tired of keeping it real
I'm (tired) tired of crying (tired)
and I'm tired of smiling (tired)
I'm tired of all the haters

I'm (tired) I'm tired of all the players
I'm (tired) tired of the games
I'm so tired (tired)
Cause it's about to drive me insane (tired)

And Oh I'm so tired of taking it (tired)
Said yeah I'm so tired of faking it (tired)
Cause you don't do it for me no more (tired)
You just don't do it no more (tired)
I'm tired of being wronged and doing right
(tired)
Said I'm tired of keeping peace in time to fight (tired)
I'm tired of letting go, then holding on (tired)
I'm tired of feeling weak and being strong (tired)
So let me hear if you tired (tired)
Gotta make some noise if you tired (tired)
Oh throw them up if you tired (tired)
Or wave your hands if your tired
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Let it go!
GO, GO, GO, GO
