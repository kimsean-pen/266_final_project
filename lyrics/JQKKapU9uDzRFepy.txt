I'm a little unsure how it got so complicated
If I let go I know I'll regret it
Every heart that I held before
I was sure to break it
I don't know what you did, but
I just can't stop thinking 'bout you every day
No, I can't stop now

Look what we started, baby
You're not what I expected
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun
Look what we started, baby
I used to look for exits
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun

I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in lo-ove
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in lo-ove

Cheyenne
Got the table set for two
Guess you couldn't make it
Thought I kissed your lips again
I was dreaming
I still believe that night we shared was something sacred
I'm tryna clear my head, but
I just can't stop thinking 'bout you every day
No, I can't stop now

Look what we started, baby
You're not what I expected
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun
Look what we started, baby
I used to look for exits
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun

I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in lo-ove
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in lo-ove

Cheyenne, Cheyenne
Cheyenne, Cheyenne

No I can't stop thinking 'bout you every day
No, I can't stop now

Look what we started, baby
You're not what I expected
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun
Look what we started, baby
I used to look for exits
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun

Cheyenne, Cheyenne
Cheyenne, Cheyenne
