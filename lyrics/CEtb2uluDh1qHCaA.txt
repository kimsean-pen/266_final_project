I'll stand before my inner slime, mirror of disgrace
To look into the deepest void where the evil lies
For I was lost into these spires
A maze of self-destructive torment of the reason
And now I know there's something more crawling through my veins
A voice resounds between these walls like a leading trace
The golden light of self-awareness revealing me the mug of the one I hate
This wrecker's chasing me forever

Grace of gods is forgotten!
You left behind all the purest breeds
Guide me to my own vengeance!

Betrayed!
And for so long my spirit faded
Through all the catastrophic matters of my existence
And all the steps I had to take for my escape
Were deeply marked by all the hate I spit against
My own creator, the great deceiver
Into these eyes, now blaze the red flames of my rise
And burn the pain, all the uncertainties are washed away
Facing the beast that I despise, into the fight!

I couldn't see the way to fall and rise again
To change the destiny of a reign
Condemned to sink into a never ending war
Of sacrifice and horror
It has been dictated by the cowardice of men!
Now I see the matter of killing this intruder
That has been stealing all my strength to dim my pureness
I'm taking back my role, I put an end to it all
Using my bare hands to take his life away!

I stand before the guilty one as it falls from grace
I see his eyes fading away, where the evil lied
And I realize for the first time:
What I have faced's the darkest side of my existence
And now I know there's something more beating with my heart
A voice resounds inside my soul like a piercing sharp
The golden wire of mortal fate's revealing me the liberating path
To leave behind this pain forever

Grace of gods is forgotten!
You left behind all the purest breeds
Guide me to my own vengeance!

Betrayed!
And for so long my spirit faded
Through all the catastrophic matters of my existence
And all the steps I had to take for my escape
Were deeply marked by all the hate I spit against
My own creator, the great deceiver
Into these eyes, now blaze the red flames of my rise
And burn the pain, all the uncertainties are washed away
Facing the beast that I despise, into the final fight!
