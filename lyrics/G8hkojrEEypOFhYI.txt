Well breathe in
She said, "That's fine
What's on your mind?"
I said, "Your skin
Can I imply that it's alright to let me in?
Just give me time
To get things right
Then we'll begin
You tell me when."

She says I'm out of her league
I don't think so
I'm not ready to leave
But I should go
There's such a wonderful breeze
From the window
And now we're takin' it down
Like a free throw
And I'm ready if you're ready to go
Just say the word, just say the word
Just say the word

This could take some time
Hands all over mine
Let this feeling slide
And girl, I'm yours tonight
And she said, "How I love the vibes."
And she's feeling so alright
And we're not coming down, we're high
So high

Well breathe in
The cigarette to ease the stress he left you with
I think you'll find that I don't mind if I'm dismissed
But you'll be fine with pouted lines break through your skin
You tell me when

Hey!
