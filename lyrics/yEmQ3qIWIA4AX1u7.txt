Soak your hands in my tepid soul, you
Grabbing pieces then you let me go, you
Soak your hands in my tepid soul... you
Grabbing pieces then you let me go, you

Whiteness, Blackness
Swallows me whole
(With in, with in)
Dance within, tepid runs through cold
Cold go, creole, the roots that you know
By those you lie, the wide lies
You're gone

Soak your hands in my tepid soul, you
Grabbing pieces then you let me go, you
Soak your hands in my tepid soul, you
Grabbing pieces then you let me go, you
Soak your hands in my tepid soul, you
Grabbing pieces then you let me go, you

Sun-soaked skin coats me in gold
Bathe in the shade, gotta braid my soul
Darkness plays in shadows on my skin
It's safely in me going with him

Soak your hands in my tepid soul, you
Grabbing pieces then you let me go, you
Soak your hands in my tepid soul, you
Grabbing pieces then you let me go, you
Soak your hands in my tepid soul, you
Grabbing pieces then you let me go, you
Soak your hands in my tepid soul, you
Grabbing pieces then you let me go, you
Soak your hands in my tepid soul, you
Grabbing pieces then you let me go, you
Soak your hands in my tepid soul, you
Grabbing pieces then you let me go, you
Soak your hands in my tepid soul, you
Grabbing pieces then you let me go, you
