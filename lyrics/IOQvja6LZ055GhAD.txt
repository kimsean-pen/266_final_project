Out in the fields, where the farmers grow bread
When called for the meals, they took for the shed
Then dark came to fall, and silence was all
A beaty shone bright, surrounded by light
C'Mon Now

I fell in love with an alien
I fell in love with her eyes
I fell in love with an alien
I'm telling you no disguise
I'm in love with an alien
I'm in love with her eyes
I'm in love with an alien
I'm telling you no disguise

She came looking out babe, for a Romeo
She ain't looking out babe, for a homeboy
I'm in love with an alien
I'm in love with her eyes
I'm in love with an alien
I'm telling you no disguise

The moon went to bed, the sun growing red
A scarecrow appeared, and chased her in fear
She sent me her love, her love to me
And then we did grow, a big family
C'Mon Now

I fell in love with an alien
I fell in love with her eyes
I fell in love with an alien
I'm telling you no disguise
I'm in love with an alien
I'm in love with her eyes
I'm in love with an alien
I'm telling you no disguise

She came looking out babe, for a Romeo
She ain't looking out babe, for a homeboy

I fell in love with an alien
I fell in love with her eyes
I fell in love with an alien
I'm telling you no disguise

I'm in love with an alien
I'm in love with her eyes
I'm in love with an alien
I'm telling you no disguise

I fell in love with an alien
I fell in love with her eyes
I fell in love with an alien
I'm telling you no disguise
I'm in love with an alien
I'm in love with her eyes
I'm in love with an alien
I'm telling you no dis...
Telling you no dis-guise
