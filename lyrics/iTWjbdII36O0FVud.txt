In the dark
Near the heart
Close to real
Desire.

In my words
In my eyes
Can't you see
The desire?

We will wait
For the night
We will wai
t For desire.

Bittersweet
Laugh and cry
Tears that taste
Of desire.

Hunted down
Through the days
Caught in nets
Of desire.

Feel the loss
As it fades
Can't forget
Desire.

Keep in touch
Keep in track
Of this thing
Called desire.

There'll be times
When we'll do
Anything
For desire.

Keep in touch
Keep in track
Keep within the reach
Of desire.

There'll be times
When we'll do
Anything
For desire.

We will wait
For the night.
We will wait...
