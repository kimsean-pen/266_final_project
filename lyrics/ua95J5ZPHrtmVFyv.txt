You say you don't want me you say you don't care
You say that your heart ain't got no room for me there
You say you don't need me
But I know that it's just a lie
'Cause you call me in the night
Tellin' me your life is better off without me
How come you're sleepin' all alone
Tellin' me you don't ever think about me
Hey you're givin' yourself away
It's there in every move you make

You can't hide your heartache away
Hey it's something you don't have to say
It's written in the tears on your face
I see through the part that you play
You're givin' yourself away
So you got all your freedom and you got all your time
So you got the illusion that you're doin' fine
So you smile in the mirror
Through the sadness your smile can't disguise
Why don't you come right out and say

"Baby you can't take another day without me?"

You know I'm runnin' through your blood
You need me like a drug and you can't live without me
Hey you're givin' yourself away
It's there in every move you make
You can't hide your heartache away
Hey it's something you don't have to say
It's written in the tears on your face

I see through the part that you play
You're givin' yourself away, you're giving yourself away

It doesn't matter what you say
You're givin' yourself away
And when you call me in the night
Tellin' me your life is better off without me
I know that you're lyin' there alone
Baby 'cause I know, you can't live without me
Hey you're givin' yourself away
It's there in every move you make

You can't hide your heartache away
Hey it's something you don't have to say
It's written in the tears on your face

I see through the part that you play
You're givin' yourself away, you're giving yourself away
It doesn't matter what you say
You're givin' yourself away
Hey it's something you don't have to say
It's written in the tears on your face
I see through the part that you play
Hey you're givin' yourself away
It's there in every move you make
You can't hide your heartache away
