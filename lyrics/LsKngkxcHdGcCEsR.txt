How is our glorious country ploughed?
Not by iron ploughs
Our lands is ploughed by tanks and feet,
Feet
Marching

Oh, America
Oh, England
How is our glorious country sown?
Not with wheat and corn.
How is our glorious land bestowed?

What is the glorious fruit of our land?
Its fruit is deformed children.
What is the glorious fruit of our land?
Its fruit is orphaned children.
