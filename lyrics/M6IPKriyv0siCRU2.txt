Newsflash, Newsflash:

They say robots are coming to tear us apart.
They'll be landing on Earth tomorrow.
So we better get a good head start.
No time to pack our things,
Take our bikes and ride for the setting sun.
As the city around us burns,
We'll be taking em on 1 by 1...
We'll be taking em on 1 by 1.

Mayday, Mayday:
A message to anyone still left alive.
Our defences won't last much longer,
But to the end, we'll put up a good fight.
No time for regrets now,
Grab a gun and get to the front lines.
As the walls begin to crumble,
We'll be defending the planet with our lives!
We'll be defending the planet with our lives!
