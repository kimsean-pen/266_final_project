You'd better believe I'm comin'
You'd better believe what I say
You'd better hold on to your promises
Because you bet, you'll get what you deserve

She's going to leave him over
She's going take her love away
So much for your eternal vows, well
It does not matter anyway

Why can't you stay here a while?
Stay here awhile, stay with me

Ohh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
All the promises we made (promises we made)
All the meaningless and empty words I prayed, prayed, prayed

Ohh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
All the promises we broke (promises we broke)
All the meaningless and empty words I spoke, spoke, spoke

Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do

What of all the things that you taught me?
What of all the things that you'd say?
What of all your prophetic preaching?
You're just throwin' it all away

Maybe we should burn the house down
Have ourselves another fight
Leave the cobwebs in the closet
'Cause tearin' them out is just not right

Why can't you stay here awhile?
Stay here awhile, stay with me

Oh-oh, ohh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
All the promises we made (promises we made)
All the meaningless and empty words I prayed, prayed, prayed

Ohh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
All the promises we broke (promises we broke)
All the meaningless and empty words I spoke, spoke, spoke

Ooh, ooh-oh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh...

Oh-oh, ohh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
All the promises we made (promises we made)
All the meaningless and empty words I prayed, prayed, prayed

Ohh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
All the promises we broke (promises we broke)
All the meaningless and empty words I spoke, spoke, spoke

Oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh
Oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh
Oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh
Oh-eh, oh-eh, eh-eh-eh
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do
