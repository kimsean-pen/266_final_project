New sensation, sensation
New sensation, sensation
New sensation, sensation

Check out this groove and you're walkin' on air
Goin' into a new dimension, yeah
So put your vibes on my beat and we'll lay it down like that
Slap the hi-hat in, put the fairlight on the track, ooh

And we can go crazy like that, feelin' like that
Movin' like that, dropin' like that
Rockin' the track, I'm lookin' for that new sensation

Woo hoo, I think we're on to somethin', you're taste it mirrors mine
So high, I'm in the moment, let's make this demo right
I might just lose it, woo hoo, when we make sweet music

No feather beds, no exotic affair, yeah
Got samples and scratches, let's do it right here
(Boys and girls, a different kind of sound)
'Cause every heartbeat babe is the soundtrack to your life, oh
And there's a man out there must be sent to get me high

And we can go crazy like that, feelin' like that
Movin' like that, dropin' like that
Rockin' the track, I'm lookin' for that new sensation

Woo hoo, I think we're on to somethin', you're taste it mirrors mine
So high, I'm in the moment, let's make this demo right
I might just lose it, woo hoo, when we make sweet music

When we make sweet music
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When we make sweet music
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When we make sweet music
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When we make sweet music

I think we're on to somethin', your taste it mirrors mine
So high I'm in the moment, let's make this demo right
I might just lose it when we make sweet music

And we can go crazy like that, feelin' like that
Movin' like that, dropin' like that
Rockin' the track, I'm lookin for that new sensation

Woo hoo, I think we're on to somethin', you're taste it mirrors mine
So high, I'm in the moment, let's make this demo right
I might just lose it, woo hoo, when we make sweet music

Woo hoo, I think we're on to somethin', you're taste it mirrors mine
So high, I'm in the moment, let's make this demo right
I might just lose it, woo hoo, when we make sweet music
When we make sweet music, when we make sweet music
