People say, love comes and goes
But they don't understand what they don't know
'Cause what I feel starts deep inside
It's kinda like a seed that springs into life

They say, it's not right and we move too fast
But they don't know the meaning of what we have

Wherever it is, I'll fly
Whatever it takes, I'll try
So don't pay no mind to whatever people say
Whenever it is in my life
Know that I will be on time
'Cause you know why there's no standing in our way

When you're far and we're apart
I'm really missing you, I wanna be where you are

They say, it's not right and it won't last
No point believing what we have

Wherever it is, I'll fly
Whatever it takes, I'll try
So don't pay no mind to whatever people say
Whenever it is in my life
I'll be on time
'Cause you know why there's no standing in my way

And if you're lost, I'm gonna find you
'Cause without you I'll break down and cry
And you know why I wanna surround you
With all my love

Is, I'll fly
It takes, I'll try
Pay no mind to what other people say
In my life be on time
You know why there's no standing in our way
Wherever it is, I'll fly
Whatever it takes, I'll try
Pay no mind to what other people say
Whenever it is in my life
Know that I will be on time
Because you know why there's no standing in my way
