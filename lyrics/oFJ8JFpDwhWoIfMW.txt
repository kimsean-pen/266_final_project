It sounds so nice, what you're proposing
Just once or twice, and not disclosing
And not disclosin' how we're really really feelingi

What you're proposing the other night
As I was leaving, looks left and right
And not believing
And not believing that I'd finally be leaving

What you're proposing, now get it right
If I'm composing, but then I might
Be runny nosing
I might be runny runny runny runny nosing
But you're supposing

Don't be so sure, and just supposing
We yell for more, and compromising
And compromising leads to really really feeling

And just supposing, don't get me wrong
I'm only dreaming, it can't be long
I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming, dreaming, only only dreaming
Am I just supposing

It sounds so nice, what you're proposing
Just once or twice, and not disclosing
And not disclosing how we're really really feeling

What you're proposing the other night
As I was leaving, looks left and right
And not believing
And not believing that I'd finally be leaving
What you're proposing
And not believing that I'd finally be leaving
What you're proposing
What you're proposing
What you're proposing
What you're proposing
What you're proposing
What you're proposing
