You're a long way from home
Can't sleep at night
Grab your telephone
Somethin' ain't right

That's evil, evil's goin' on
And I'm just warnin' you brother
You better watch your happy home

Long way from home
Can't sleep at all
Feels like a mule's kickin' in your skull

That's evil, evil's goin' on
And I'm just warnin' you brother
You better watch your happy home

Watch it, watch it!

Long way from home
You can't sleep at all
Feels like another mule's kickin' in your skull

That's evil, evil's goin' on
And I'm just warnin' you brother
You better watch your happy home

Watch your happy, watch your, watch your happy home

yeah, evil, evil, evil!

watch your happy home
