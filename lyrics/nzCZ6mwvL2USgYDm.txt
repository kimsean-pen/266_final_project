I'm amazed at how you reinforce your contrast
Deep inside, you're still a son of a bitch
Mistakes forever haunt you
One line to prosecute you

So thoroughly, it's giving you fits
It's giving you fits!

In your world; misbelief
No one loves you, hold your breath
Count to ten, bare hands to a vacant glass
'Cause I don't think it helped you ever fill

When movement ceases, and everything is still
I thought that time was frozen
Instead we're resting; scathed

I thought we'd be forever, what was I to say?
Oh, you were never alone, you just didn't know
Where to fucking go Ahhh-Ohh

Finding no real escape, you're fucked
There's no escape

Do you (Are you a-okay)
Feel pride (Do you wake up, and smile)
Do you (Do you feel alright)
Feel pride (Are you always shining)

Do you feel pride?
Do you feel pride?
Do you wake up, and smile?

I'm amazed at how you reinforce your contrast
Deep inside, you're still a son of a bitch
Mistakes forever haunt you
One line to prosecute you

So thoroughly, it's giving you fits
It's giving you fits, Ahh, giving you fits

I gave you everything you wanted
You were everything to me

In your world; misbelief
In your world, no one loves you!
