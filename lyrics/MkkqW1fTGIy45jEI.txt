My secrets are burning a hole through my heart
And my bones catch a fever
When it cuts you up this deep
It's hard to find a way to breathe
But your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe
Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking
I'm at the edge of the world
Where do I go from here?
Yeah do I disappear?
Edge of the world
Do I sink or swim?
Or simply disappear?
But your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin is smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe
Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Wake up
Take my hand
Give me a reason to start again
Wake up, yeah take my hand
Give me a reason to start again
Cuz your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe
Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking
