It was a Friday night
No cover but the cover band was soundin' right
And there you were
Just flirty dancin' by the neon sign
To fishin' in the dark
You were reelin' in my heart

Now look at where we are
I'm hooked on kissin' you gettin'
Gettin' you turned on
Buzzin' and lovin' on you

All night long. Like a hit song
On the radio. You already know
The way it goes
All it took was a look
And I was hooked on

The way that you're takin'
Takin' my shirt off
And runnin' my fingers through your
Long blonde hair fallin' in your eyes

Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was hooked
It's Saturday. You're still asleep and I could leave
But no way. This ain't a one night fling kinda thing
I wanna wake you up
I wanna press my luck

Land my lips on your cheek
Like I can't get enough
Cause I'm hooked on kissin' you gettin'
Gettin' you turned on
Buzzin' and lovin' on you

All night long. Like a hit song
On the radio. You already know
The way it goes
All it took was a look
And I was hooked on

The way that you're takin'
Takin' my shirt off
And runnin' my fingers through your
Long blonde hair fallin' in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine

All it took was a look and I was hooked
You got me hooked on kissin' you gettin'
Gettin' you turned on
Buzzin' and lovin' on you
All night long. Like a hit song

On the radio. You already know
The way it goes
All it took was a look
And I was hooked on

The way that you're takin'
Takin' my shirt off
And runnin' my fingers through your
Long blonde hair fallin' in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was hooked
