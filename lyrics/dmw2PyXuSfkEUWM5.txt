Oh boy I just can wait for history class
It's my favorite hour of the day
(My favorite hour of the day)
Up on the chalkboard I just love your ass (Mmm)
When you write notes, it shake, shake, shakes
(Shake, shake, shake, shake)
So when you get back my pop quiz (pop quiz)
What will you think when you read this?
Mr. Watson I Want To Get With You
I Won't Tell A Soul What We're Gonna Do
Want To Get My Hands In Your Khaki Pants
Teacher, Teacher, what cha' gonna do?
(Teacher what cha' gonna do?)
'Cause I am coming on to you
Ha ha ha ha ha
Can't put my finger on what's so sexy (So sexy)
And why I want you in my bed (Or on your desk)
Is it your power, your authority?
Or for the thrill of being so, so bad (So bad)
Can I please see you after class?
There is something that I have to ask (ha ha)

And you know (you know) it's a fantasy of mine
So why waste time?
