Hey! Hey! Hey!
That's what I say
Hey! Hey! Hey!

I'm waiting I'm aching, I'm running away
you can't stop me no matter what they say
It's twisting and turning inside me again
I've get this feeling this could be the end
you keep raising the stakes... I keep making mistakes

Don't you know is a game and do you got what it takes?
For me to stay ALIVE, boy!

Hey! Hey! Hey!
That's what I say
Hey! Hey! Hey!
It's not ok... It's not ok
That's what I say
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

The sooner the better, you see me this way.
We can't go on like this pretending it's okay.
It's twisting and turning inside me again
We keep getting closer to the end
you keep raising the stakes I keep making mistakes

Didn't you know is a game and do you got what it takes?
For me to stay ALIVE, boy!

Hey! Hey! Hey!
That's what I say
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
It's not ok... It's not ok
That's what I say
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

I won't stop running away from you
gonna find me anyway
I keep running, I'm gonna give it all back
to you tonight...

Heeyyy!

Hey! Hey! Hey!
That's what I say
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
It's not ok... It's not ok
That's what I say
Hey! Hey! Hey!
That's what I say
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
It's not ok... It's not ok
Hey! Hey! Hey! Heeeyyy!
