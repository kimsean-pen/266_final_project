You say you loved me
I say what!
You say you loved me
Ok let's rock
You say you loved me
I say what!
You say you loved me
Ok let's rock

You have an ugly tattoo and fucking cheap perfume
Couldn't dance, barely moved, didn't know what to do
You have a friend in the band but they're not that cool
You say you loved me
Ok let's rock

Everything was wrong with you
So breaking up was easy to do
Hate your friends and your family too
So breaking up was easy to do

Breaking up
Breaking up
Breaking up

You say you loved me
I say what!
You say you loved me
Ok let's rock
You say you loved me
I say what!
You say you loved me
Ok let's rock

You try to pull us apart
And make a brand new start
You tried to drive me to France
We didn't get very far
You said forever baby but I'm not not so sure
You say you loved me
Ok let's rock

Everything was wrong with you
So breaking up was easy to do
Hate your friends and your family too
So breaking up was easy to do

Everything was wrong with you
So breaking up was easy to do
Hate your friends and your family too
So breaking up was easy to do

Breaking up
