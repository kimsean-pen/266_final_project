One, Two, Three, Four
Ohh-Ohh-Ohh-Ohh

Play the lotto you might win it
It's like 25 to life so you bust out of prison
Something's in the air
Something's in the air

It's like that feeling when you're just about to kill it
Take your last shot you know you're going to hit it
Something's in the air
Something's in the air
Woah Ohh

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling, and its grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like

Ohh Woah Ooh
Ohh Woah Ooh
Ohh Woah Ooh
Something Big I feel it happening
Ohh Woah Ooh
Ohh Woah Ooh
Ohh Woah Ooh
Something Big

It's like that feeling when you're about to win the medal
And you worked so hard that you knew you wouldn't settle
Hands are in the air
Hands are in the air

When they hear you and you thought they wouldn't listen
It's like an anthem that the whole world's singin'
Hands are in the air
Hands are in the air
Ohh Woah Ooh

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling, and its grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like

Ohh Woah Ooh
Ohh Woah Ooh
Ohh Woah Ooh
Something Big I feel it happening
Ohh Woah Ooh
Ohh Woah Ooh
Ohh Woah Ooh
Something Big

Ohh Woah Ooh
Yeah Yeah

If we stomp our feet the ground will shake
If we clap our hands the walls will break
Yell so loud, won't forget our names
Cause something big is happening
Take this rock and start a fire
Raise this up we're feeling high
They can't tell us anything
Something big is happening

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling, and its grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like
Ohh Woah Ooh
Ohh Woah Ooh
Ohh Woah Ooh
Something Big is happening
Ohh Woah Ooh
Ohh Woah Ooh
Ohh Woah Ooh
Something big I feel it happening
