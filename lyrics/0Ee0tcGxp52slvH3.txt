So long to electric fences
Not much left for me to run from now
Guess I'll turn myself around
I'm putting down my defenses
These wings are gonna take me off the ground
It's freedom's sweetest sound

And I'll admit that I was wrong
and it's obvious that I'm
Finally taking my fist down
Would you stop and take a look at me now
Could you stop and take a look at me now

When your standing right in front of me
Your looking at the positive that was negative
Would you stop and take a look at me now
Don't know what you get tomorrow
Not sure I wanna go too well
Isn't that what life's about
So long for the fear and worry

Lets go and you wont be sorry
I'll be the one that gets you out
Chase the demons out tonight
You can see how fast they run
When you turn the light switch on

Would you stop and take a look at me now
Could you stop and take a look at me now
When your standing right in front of me
Your looking at the positive there was negative

Would you stop and take a look at me now
And it gets more beautiful it gets more beautiful
As the sun turns into rain
And the hurt turns into shame
And it gets more wonderful it gets more wonderful
Can you get this through your brain
That you cannot lose again
Would you stop and take a look at me now
Could you stop and take a look at me now
When your standing right in front of me
Your looking at the positive there was negative
Would you stop and take a look at me now
