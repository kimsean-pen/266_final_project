As I cough out fire
You're lighting up
And you burn me with every maybe
And I cut the chords and I break the locks
But I'm powerless in your slavery

And I curse this hell
And I hate your guts
And I swear I will pay for this craving never again
Never again

But we'll be making love like savages
I'll lick the poison from right off your kiss
Fall on rosy thorns for a taste of lethal bliss
Oh we'll be making love like savages
Savages
Savages

As I choke on flames
You light up your torch
Each of my defeats is your victory
And I walk barefoot on a field of swords
You have mastered the art of cruelty

And I curse this hell
And I hate your guts
And I swear I'll dance with the devil never again
Never again

But we'll be making love like savages
I'll lick the poison from right off your kiss
Fall on rosy thorns for a taste of lethal bliss
Oh we'll be making love like savages
Savages
Savages

Savages
Savages
