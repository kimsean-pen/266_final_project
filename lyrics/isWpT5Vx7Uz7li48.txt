Gold, gold, she looked like she was golden
Think she would have landed me if she got any closer
But as I leaned in, she grew wings
Felt like I was falling through it as she rose then

Gone gone, quickly as the dawn
I was never knowing if she'd ever come home
So with all my might changed my mind
But an angel leaves an imprint on your broken bones

Girl, churl, from out of this world
Slow like thunder rare like pearls
When morning came the darkness stayed
Now all I want to do is shade the shame
Shade the shame
Shade the shame
Shade the shame

And when she's falling
Do you really think you'll waste my time
Her name I am calling
Do you really think I've lost my mind

A study of the girl with wings

Daylight it never felt right
To live inside a bunker for the rest of my life
The mold the rot that you forgot
Is a figure floating has a broken mirror for a mind

Gold, gold, faces you get older
Walk like caramoony, though I know I am a soldier
You had a son, you both moved on
But you know you cast a shadow off the lawn
Off the lawn
Off the lawn
Off the lawn

And when she's falling
Do you really think you'll waste my time
Her name I am calling
Do you really think I've lost my mind
It's been killing me all this time
That we should ever have discovered
Feel like I've wasted all my life
Cause I could never grow feathers

A study of the girl with wings
A study of the girl with wings

Oh, it's been killing me all this time
That we should have ever discovered
Feel like I've wasted all my life
Cause I could never grow feathers, no
For you
