Now's the time, unpack your case
And push your gold in the safest place
So scared, you sweat and run for the hills
While I lay back and cherish my chance to grip my will

There is a train we take downtown
That buckles and bends from the weight underground
You'll slowly lose faith in gravity
And give up the urge to sweat, and charm, and love, and breathe

I hear you dish it out, dish it out, dish it out
I hear you dish it out, dish it out
While you want to remain my friend
No it's not, it's not quite the same

Remember me when you dissolve in the rain
When the rivers run dry through the cold mountain range
When you turn to the name you invented
To keep your identity safe from the smell of defeat
When there is no way to carve your righteous paths of rage
By holding the candle to those half your age

Your jaw will be locked from hornets and bees
And you'll understand why I leave so suddenly with the breeze
