Dark rings 'round her eyes where her face hit the floor
Bleak days, long nights, tensing when she hears the door
Ten thousand secrets locked up in her head
She needs to escape or she's gonna wind up dead

Call me a sinner-man, I would feed him cinnamon
No water in his hands, he needs to understand
I can't forgive a man of so many sins
He broke a mother's heart, he bit into her kids

Violence dripping from your gold ring
Attack her while she's sleeping
Excess to a rifle, it's time to get up and
Run, run, run

Young love was not only then the penny dropped
Face stern, big man, heavy boots, a heavy hand
Lost in the chaos of a million things
All down to the burden of a plain gold ring

Piece by piece, she puts together what is left
Down on my knees, doused in holy water, undressed
Calling on the gods to come and take him away
Take him away, take, take him away

Violence dripping from your gold ring
Attack her while she's sleeping
Excess to a rifle, it's time to get up and
Run, run, run

Violence dripping from your gold ring
Attack her while she's sleeping
Excess to a rifle, it's time to get up and-

Violence dripping from your gold ring
Attack her while she's sleeping
Excess to a rifle, it's time to get up and
Run, run, run
