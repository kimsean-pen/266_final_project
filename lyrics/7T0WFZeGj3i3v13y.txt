The glove compartment is inaccurately named
And everybody knows it
So I'm proposing a swift, orderly change

'Cause behind its door, there's nothing to keep my fingers warm
And all I find are souvenirs from better times
Before the gleam of your taillights fading east
To find yourself a better life

I was searching for some legal document
As the rain beat down on the hood
When I stumbled upon pictures I'd tried to forget
And that's how this idea was drilled into my head
'Cause it's too important to stay the way it's been

There's no blame for how our love did slowly fade
And now that it's gone it's like it wasn't there at all
And here I rest, where disappointment and regret collide
Lying awake at night

And there's no blame for how our love did slowly fade
And now that it's gone it's like it wasn't there at all
And here I rest, where disappointment and regret collide
Lying awake at night, up all night
When I'm lying awake at night
