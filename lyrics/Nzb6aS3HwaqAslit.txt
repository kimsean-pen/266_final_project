It is not a good day if you are not looking good
This is the best damn party that I've ever been to
Today I asked for a god to pour some wine in my eyes
Today I asked for someone to shake some salt in my life

Look every thing's spinning
(We're on the ground)
Never cheer before you know who's winning
(Don't make a sound)

You sniff the glass and let it roll around on your tongue
Let me introduce you to someone before the party is done
Someone to look to in need or in want or in war
If you give him everything, he may give you even more

Look every thing's spinning
(We're on the ground)
Never cheer before you know who's winning
(Don't make a sound)

Look every thing's spinning we're on the ground

Never cheer before you know who's winning don't make a sound
Don't make a sound

Every thing's spinning we're on the ground
Every thing's spinning we're on the ground

This is the best damn party I've been to
This is the best damn party I've been to
This is the best damn party I've been to
This is the best damn party I've been to

Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
