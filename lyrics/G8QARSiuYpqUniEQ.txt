I love my life without you,
You can't say a thing
I feel that I should tell you,
Can't do anything

You're holding on,
To love that's gone
And I'll be gone just as soon

I know that he'll believe me
Best be on your way,
I hope that I won't see you
As you drive away

You're holding on,
To love that's gone
And I'll be gone just as soon

[Ooooh~]

I'm better off alone now,
You might know I'll be
I wish that (here?) would see you
Walk the (wrongful way?)

You're holding on,
To love that's gone
And I'll be gone just as soon

I love my life without you,
You can't say a thing
I feel that I should tell you,
Can't do anything

You're holding on,
To love that's gone
And I'll be gone just as soon

You can't say a thing,
Can't do anything,
You can't say a thing.
