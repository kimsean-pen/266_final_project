Pins, needles and butterflies
Into deeper pools I dive
To re-emerge
Almost submerged
Ultraviolet

Is it slight of hand
Or the surest touch
You caught me as I fell
And put me on a pedestal
Can you be sure thats right?

My king of hearts
Are we the only two
To feel so powerless
And yet so powerful

And all at once
We are all at one
So take my hand and
Well explore a land of mellow truthfulness

Something deep in you
Touches something
So deep in me
And suddenly destiny
Lays down in front of me
Its what I
Was designed to do
To touch something so deep in you
And suddenly awake sleeping sensitivity

I was a run away
But what was I running too
You stopped me in my tracks
When I turned back
All I could see is you

The wind
telling tales of golden histories
Whispering among the trees
Of heaven and its mysteries

And soon
We two will commune
Like the spheres of sun and moon
The perfume of the rose in bloom

Something deep in you
Touches something
So deep in me
And suddenly destiny
Lays down in front of me
Its what I
Was designed to do
To touch something so deep in you
Suddenly awake sleeping sensitivity...
