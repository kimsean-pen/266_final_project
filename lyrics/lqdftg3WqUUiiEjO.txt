I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
No one would believe me

Say it in a whisper
That, baby, it don't get much better
Would I like to see you again?

You name the day
And I will pick the city
We'll fly away
Til then, call me when you miss me
If you're asking if I'd really like to see you again
I say ooh just say when

Tell me that you feel it
This, you and me together
No one would believe me
Even I cannot believe it

You kiss me like you mean it
Oh, baby, it don't get much better
Would I like to see you again?

Oh darlin' just say when

You name the day
And I will pick the city
We'll fly away
Til then, call me when you miss me
If you're asking if I'd really like to see you again
I say ooh, yeah, just say when

Two different worlds
I thought they'd keep us apart
I'm ignoring my head
Followin' my heart

Oh you pick the day, darling
I will pick the city
We'll fly away
Til then, call me when you miss me
I am willing to wait 'cuz I just gotta see you again
So don't ask
No, just say when

You name the day
And I will pick the city (Yeah, just say when)
We'll fly away
Til then, call me when you miss me
If you're asking if I'd really like to see you again
I say ooh
I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
No one would believe me
