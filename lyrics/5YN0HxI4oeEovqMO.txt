1, 2, 3
I'm alone at my house
I'm out on the town
I'm at the bottom of the bottle
I'm there knockin' them down

I can't get back up on my feet,
see the lights all on the streetlights stars

But look what I found
Look what I found
Another piece of my heart just laying on the ground

Another foggy day
I'm looking for a light
And my only prayer is working tonight

I can't get myself out of bed
Hear these voices in my head like a song

But look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what I found
Somebody who carry
Around a piece of my heart
Just laying on the ground

When I met you I was blown to pieces
Heart all over the floor
Ever since you put me back together
I can't believe it, can't believe it

Look what you found
Yeah, baby
Look what I found
Somebody who carries around a piece of my heart
Look what I found, Woo
Look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what we found
Someone who carries around a piece of my heart, heart
Just laying on the ground
