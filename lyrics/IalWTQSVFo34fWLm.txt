Give it away now, girl
Can't hold on to mine
Every black and white
Secrets of blinking light
And like flies on crap
Said she's feeling warm for everyone tonight
Although possible
Said she's feeling good, said she's feeling good

Smiling beautiful
She says I'll make it bad
For everyone to hide
Twisting by my girl
Nothing left to lose
Nothing left to fight

Give it away now, girl
Can't hold on to mine
Every black and white
Secrets of seeking light
In a flash of time
Said she's feeling warm for everyone tonight
Smiling beautiful
She says I'll make it bad for everyone to hide
