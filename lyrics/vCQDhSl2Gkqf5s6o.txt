The light is fading.
Everything dissolves in blue
As we become one with what surrounds.
Crawl back into the womb
But it's getting colder.
There's no comfort in this place
Even now that we're still so far away.
From this point on there's only one direction: down.

From this point on all we do
Is let ourselves sink down
Until the bottom, until we hit the ground.
Sinking towards the unknown inside of ourselves.
Towards me and towards you,
Towards the essence, towards truth.

It's getting dark now
But I'm still trying to follow you.
There is not always a reason
But everything can be traced back to a cause,
So much is sure.
I'm ready to dig it all up
But so far there's not much
I recognize in your dissection of me.

When we're coming close to this familiar place
That has not lost its appeal.
Fears we need to face:
To break out of these cycles
We must rebuild this all from scratch.
Start all over again.

Eyes in the twilight stare at us
As we're going down - not alone.
