I lost at love before
Got mad and closed the door
But you said try just once more
I chose you for the one
Now I'm having so much fun
You treated me so kind
I'm about to lose my mind
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life...

The others were untrue
But when it came to lovin' you
I'd spend my whole life with you
'Cause you came and you took control
You touched my very soul
You always showed me that
Loving you was where it's at
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life...

Thank you baby
Yeah... yeah-yeah...

I love you so much it seems
You're even in my dreams I can hear
Babe I hear you calling me
I'm so in love with you
All I ever want to do is
Thank you baby
Thank you baby

You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life...
You made me so very happy
You made me so so very happy baby
I'm so glad you came... into my life...
Mmm... mmm...
I wanna thank you girl
Every day of my life I wanna thank you
You made me so very happy
I wanna spend my life thanking you
Thank you baby
Thank you baby
Thank you baby
Thank you
