Did you find what you had before
Can you see what you want to ignore
Yes, there's no doubt about it
Did you buy what you can't afford
You're wakin' up on the kitchen floor
Yes, there's no doubt about it
No doubt about it

Trying to figure out who you're supposed to be
How'd you find yourself if you never leave
I live my whole life in a fantasy
And I'm about to let go

What's my motivation
You see so much more than you could see before
It's a permanent vacation
I'm willing to learn but I won't wait my turn
What's my motivation
Woah woah oh oh
To leave this permanent vacation

Can't you drive like we're out of time
You spent your money and you know it's a crime
Yes, there's no doubt about it
So give it up but you don't know why
So kiss goodbye to the summer
Yes, there's no doubt about it
No doubt about it

Trying to figure out who you're supposed to be
How'd you find yourself if you never leave
I live my whole life in a fantasy
And I'm about to let go

What's my motivation
You see so much more than you could see before
It's a permanent vacation
I'm willing to learn but I won't wait my turn
What's my motivation
Woah woah oh oh
To leave this permanent vacation
Woah woah oh oh
To leave this permanent vacation
Oh

It's time to go
It's time to go
It's time to go
I said oh
It's time to go
It's time to go
It's time to go

What's my motivation
You see so much more than you could see before
It's a permanent vacation
I'm willing to learn but I won't wait my turn
What's my motivation
Woah woah oh oh
To leave this permanent vacation
Woah woah oh oh
To leave this permanent vacation
