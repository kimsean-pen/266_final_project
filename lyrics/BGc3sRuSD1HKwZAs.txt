It's been pretty simple so far
Vacation in Athens is calling me
And knock, knock, knock on wood
I thought I'd left you behind

Heaven is yours, heaven is yours
Heaven is yours where I live

I followed the catacombs
Left my soul at home
This letter never sent
And it's so far, it's so dark, I'm so lost

Heaven is yours, heaven is yours
Heaven is yours where I live
(Another story, another story for a while, someone show me)
When I'm moving too fast
Here's my new address

The water's receiving me now
The catacombs are filling in
If my soul was made of stone
No, not, not so dark, dark
And it's so far, it's so dark, I'm so lost
And it's so far, it's so far, it's so far

Heaven is yours, heaven is yours
Heaven is yours where I live
(Another story, another story for a while, someone show me)
Heaven is yours, heaven is yours
Heaven is yours where I live
(Another story, another story for a while, someone show me)
