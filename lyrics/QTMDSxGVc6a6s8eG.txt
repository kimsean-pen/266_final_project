Tell me where these shadows came from
What clouded our reality?
Was is it just too easy, or was it just the pain?
Was it all enough for you to bring us to the end?

Covered up by motion blur
There were no mistakes - yet I feel it burn

Qualified to measure my own misery
I cannot believe there is nothing left for me
Tell me why I even bother, tell me why I sit and cry
You said every word so clear yet I sit here wonder why

Darkness struck by lightning
Divided into half's
No reason nor a purpose
The end just came so fast

All that's left is shadows
Cast by our shallow dreams
But the fire is still burning
So deep inside, inside of me...

I will not give up until
The truth's nailed to the wall
The lies won't serve our purpose
In corruption lies our fall

The overmind is dying
Its eyes can't see us all
But I'll be here when you are gone
I'll make it through the storm...
