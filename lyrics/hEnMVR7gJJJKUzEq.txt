(When all is said and done Where will you be? You'll be staring right back
Right back at me Never, never talk back to me Quiver at the sound
That we scream)

Never been a fan of goodbyes
You know that
I'd rather leave you here to die
You know that

And when you say my name
You get the best of me
I feel, I can feel

(You're bitter You can't get over me Deliver Her body back to sea)

Won't let you be the death of me
You know that
Before it's over you will see
The waves crash

And when you say my name
You get the best of me
I feel, I can feel
You won't be leaving anytime soon
You're sewn into my veins
I'm left with all the memories
Behind the broken frames

(Far away, far away I can see your face
Out of flames you fly Out of broken frames Silence words you cry
Left to wonder why I'm waiting)

And when you say my name
You get the best of me
I feel, (I can feel)
You won't be leaving anytime soon
(You're sewn into my veins)
I'm left with all the memories
(Behind the broken frames)

And when you say my name
You get the best of me
I feel, I can feel
You won't be leaving anytime soon
You're sewn into my veins
I'm left with all the memories
Behind the broken frames
(Behind the broken frames You're sewn into my veins)
