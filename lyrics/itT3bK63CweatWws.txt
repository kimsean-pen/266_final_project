There you go
There you go, there you go

I heard you like what I do
Heard you do what I say
So baby boy, can we get away?
(Get away, get away)

Cause me plus you
Equals everything we shouldn't do
But you plus me
Equals everything I wanna be

Hang up the phone
Hop in your whip
Boy, I'm home alone
In this empty ass crib
And I ain't goin' nowhere
'Cept somewhere with you
'Cept somewhere with you
Drive slow, remember patience is a virtue
There you go at my front door
I ain't goin' nowhere
'Cept somewhere with you
Hang up the phone
There you go, there you go
There you go, there you go
There you go, there you go
There you go, there you go

And I'm not one to accept what has happened
Weird stares now becoming a pattern
It's dark and I'm lost in the sadness
A delusion, we can't seem to grasp it

Me plus you
Equals everything we shouldn't do
But you plus me
Equals everything I wanna be

Hang up the phone
Hop in your whip
Boy, I'm home alone
In this empty ass crib
And I ain't goin' nowhere
'Cept somewhere with you
'Cept somewhere with you
Drive slow, remember patience is a virtue
There you go at my front door
I ain't goin' nowhere
'Cept somewhere with you
Hang up the phone
There you go, there you go
There you go, there you go
There you go, there you go
There you go, there you go
There you go, there you go
There you go
