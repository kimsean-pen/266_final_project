I learned how to fall today
Didn't think it would kill you
To settle the debt I
Thought never would be paid

Found out I was wrong today
Too weak to continue
One final defense to fall
Still unbroken, now I am torn
Thought it was over this time
And we know

There's still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
We're gonna let it burn
Let it burn, 'til the
Image fades away

Knew there was a price to pay
Didn't think it would thrill you
To witness the fallen one
Shattered and ashamed
No, I'm not the only one
Yearning to fulfill you

Unwilling to risk it all
Still uncertain, now I am torn
Thought it was over this time
And we know
There's still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
We're gonna let it burn

Let it burn, 'til the
Image fades away
Yeah!
Now I am torn
Thought it was over this time

And we know
There's still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
That I am torn
Thought it was over this time
And we know
There's still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
We're gonna let it burn
Let it burn, 'til the
Image fades away
