Dead body prepared
to its last judgement
the Book of the Dead
takes him to the tribunal

The Hall of Double Justice
the judges of the dead
face to face with Osiris
the soul will be weighed

The pans of balance
weigh the heart
all the sins will be discovered
by the symbol of truth

Thoth weighs
and writes the result
the Osiris
reads the judgement

The words of Osiris
the words that liberate
no sins committed
the soul is truly pure

The Kingdom of Osiris
now opened to this soul
eternity now ahead
Immortality
