La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

It took too long
For you to call back
And normally I would just forget that
Except for the fact it was my birthday...
My stupid birthday

I played along
Rolled right off my back
But obviously my armor was cracked
What kind of a boyfriend would forget that?
Who would forget that?

The type of guy who doesn't see
What he has until she leaves
"Don't let me go"
'Cause without me know you're lost
Wise up now or pay the cost...
Soon you will know...

You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' with me
You're not winnin' 'til you're winnin'
Winnin' me
You're not gettin' 'til you're gettin'
Gettin' to me
You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' for me

This is the potential breakup song
Our album needs just one
Oh baby please, please tell me

We got along, we got along, we got along
Until you did that
Now all I want is just my stuff back
Do you get that
Let me repeat that
I want my stuff back

You can send it in a box
I don't care just drop it off
I won't be home
'Cause without me you know you're lost
Minus you I'm better off
Soon you will know

You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' with me
You're not winnin' 'til you're winnin'
Winnin' me
You're not gettin' 'til you're gettin'
Gettin' to me
You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' for me

You can try, you can try
You know, I know it'd be a lie
Without me you're gonna die
So you better think clearly clearly
Before you nearly nearly
Bust up the situation that you're gonna miss
Dearly, dearly
Come on

You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' with me
You're not winnin' 'til you're winnin'
Winnin' me
You're not gettin' 'til you're gettin'
Gettin' to me
You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' for me
This is the potential breakup song
Our album needs just one
Oh baby please, please tell me
This is the potential makeup song
Please just admit you're wrong
Which will it be which will it be
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
