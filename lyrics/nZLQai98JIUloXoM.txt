U-oh-u-oh-u-oho

An animal, is what you find
When you cross the line
And can't decide
What you do with this
And you should've know better

Your wise and dress
But you cannot get
It's a game of choice
And you soon forget
What you came away
And you should've know better

You should have know much better
Could have known much better
Too much - it's too much
Cause it would be so much better
If you just want to wait
Sorry to say, but I know that you are thinking...

That I'm better than you
I know it's true
Cause I see it in your eyes
And do you think that I'm an animal?
An animal...
I know it's out of place to think I'm another race
You think that I'm an animal
An animal...

U-oh-u
U-oh-u
I'm an animal
An animal...
U-oh-u
U-oh-u
I'm an animal.

Animal - is a state of mind
It's a drug of choice
And will wake you blind
But you're here tonight
And you could've know better

You mind is set
Like your in mood
When you cross the room
You're a living proof
That you're bound to loose
And you should've known better

You should have know much better
Could have known much better
Too much - it's too much
Cause it would be so much better
If you just want to wait
Sorry to say, but I know that you are thinking...

That I'm better than you
I know it's true
Cause I see it in your eyes
And do you think that I'm an animal?
An animal...
I know it's out of place to think I'm another race
You think that I'm an animal
An animal...

U-oh-u
U-oh-u
I'm an animal
An animal...
U-oh-u
U-oh-u
I'm an animal

So what you want
You living a dream
And you don't wanna wake up
Think you know it all
All you ground has been made
But your mind is made up

You think I'm...

Better than you
I know it's true
Cause I see it in your eyes
And do you think that I'm an animal?
An animal...
I know it's out of place to think I'm another race
You think that I'm an animal
An animal...

U-oh-u
U-oh-u
I'm an animal
An animal...
U-oh-u
U-oh-u
I'm an animal
