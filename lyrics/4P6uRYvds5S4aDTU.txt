Rotten apple to the core
Damn, I been a fuck up
Getting picked for last in gym
I can't even do a lay up
Writing on my sneakers
Being sneaky with my teachers
Smoking weed under the bleachers
Cutting out and glueing pictures
Carrying my CD player
Sucking on a Now or Later
Sour Apple was the flavor
Scribbling on doodle paper
Trying hard to pay attention
But I have no real direction
So I say, "yo, fuck this lesson"
Spark the leaf, my back is stressing
Who I am and where I'm headed
Cutting school and acting crazy
Foster care done got me crazy
Living with a crazy lady

Every day I'm always late
Puffin' on a skimpy j
Staying in my grandma house
Wasn't even far away
But I guess that's what I do
Making life more difficult for me and you

Ay caramba
Bart Simpson with the shits
Ay caramba, man, you can go and suck my dick
Skating down the street, being mischievous as shit

This as good as it gon get
Always cheat on yo tests
Don't you be like the rest
I ain't no teacher's pet

Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
If that don't work then
Deny, deny, deny
Looking to my future is like looking at the sky
Inner city orphan with my hand in apple pie
A liar, a schemer, a cheater, I do it all
I used to switch schools each coming fall
I skipped all my classes and
Still managed to pass them all
Reading comics in forbidden planet
I go home to a place of fantasy outside my own
Always been a loner, never had a solid home
I really like Marvel 'cause characters look just like me
And women don't have roles that make them look too sexually
I lie a lot from getting beaten and put off food, I'm not eating
Eczema so bad I'm bleeding, but I smile and keep it cheesing
A nerdy girl with nymphomanic tendencies
Everyone's offended but nobody here offended me
90's mami dressing like Aaliyah, quite apparently
I'm heavy with the theory, I move with the groove
I'm Black like Shaolin, I tang with the Wu
Africa, my guy, with the bantu do
I'm stupid fucking crazy nuts, loose like a screw
See, I know my money, got raised by the Jews
I'm a New York Puerto Rican like a rough kinda dude
I'ma hit the barrio and eat some Spanish food
And sit in Central Park, I'm in a New York mood

Bart Simpson with the shits
Ay caramba, man, you can go and suck my dick
Skating down the street, being mischievous as shit

This as good as it gon get
Always cheat on yo tests
Don't you be like the rest
I ain't no teacher's pet
