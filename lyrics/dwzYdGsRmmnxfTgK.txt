Down in south Oakland, off east 14th its raining
(oh yeah!)
six a.m. on Sunday and the bums are praying
(oh yeah!)
met her at a party we were drunk now were sober
(oh yeah!)
she said its cold got a long walk home come over
(oh yeah!)

She's a bombshell

she's a bombshell

I've retraced my steps a thousand times
(oh yeah)
seems I've spent hours asking all my friends about her
(oh yeah!)
been six months but ill never be the same
(oh yeah)
nobody remembers her name
(oh yeah!)

She's a bombshell
she's a bombshell
she's a bombshell
(oh yeah!)

She's (she's) she's a bombshell
she's (she's) she's a bombshell
(oh yeah!)
she's (she's) she's a bombshell
she's (she's) she's a bombshell
(ooh yeah!)
