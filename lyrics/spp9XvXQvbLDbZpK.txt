You came down like the news to the valley
An American boy dressed in corduroy
Oh they used to throw parades for the holidays
But it's different nowadays
When there's nothing worth that stays

But life is not about loving anybody else
At first you lose control and then you lose yourself
This life is not about loving honey
At first you lose control then you lose your money

Oh you think so much and live so little
Got your hope stitched on your sleeve
But you're the one that deceives
Turning pain into a perfect product
Modernism is a dream we've been living in between

But life is not about loving anybody else
At first you lose control and then you lose yourself
This life is not about loving honey
At first you lose control then you lose your money

Oh what can you do
When your mind is a palace but your heart is a menace
Oh what can you do
Gonna burn it on a stake to destroy is to create

Oh what can you do
When your mind is a palace but your heart is a menace
Oh what can you do
There is nothing to debate to destroy is to create
