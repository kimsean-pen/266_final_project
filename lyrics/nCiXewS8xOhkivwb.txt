Maybe you don't understand it
But if you're a natural man
You got to ball and have a good time
And that's what I call chooglin'

Here comes Mary lookin' for Harry
She gonna choogle tonight
Here comes Louie, works in the sewer, Lord
He gonna choogle tonight

Keep on chooglin'

Chooglin', chooglin', chooglin'

Waaah, nah, nah

Waaah, nah, nah, nah

Waaah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Keep on chooglin'

If you can choose it, who can refuse it?
Y'all be chooglin' tonight
Go on, take your pick, right from the get go
You gotta choogle tonight

Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Chooglin'

Chooglin', chooglin'
Chooglin', chooglin'

Waaah, nah, nah, nah, nah
