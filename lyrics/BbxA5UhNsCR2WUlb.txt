Twisted dark sister 'round my finger I wish
Streak of blue, linger you, I feel no kiss
Creature of my desire, takes us higher
To not hold your face or feel your embrace, is why I waste

But she's just a phase, just a phase
Boy yeah she's easy to replace
She's just a phase, just a phase
Boy yeah you're tripping out where you lay

Silently delighted, I am poisoned slow
These emerald eyes, reveal that I got to let her go
Bleeding out my reasons, till the red reaches the ceiling
Flock of you, flutters through, I wonder if she knew

But she's just a phase, just a phase
Boy yeah she's easy to replace
She's just a face, just a daze
Boy next to you, she'll never lay
