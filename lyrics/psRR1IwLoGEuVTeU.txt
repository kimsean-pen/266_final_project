you want every day to be like that magic first
when she took shape in your eyes and you in hers
you're going down to see her, it's a big mistake
she got ice she don't want anyone to break
don't call on me to make disguises fade away
'cause honestly I'm more inclined to let them stay
on your faces and over mine

i know how to turn others inside out
i can't stand by here waiting while they dumb me down
i fit the perfect picture that you want for all
the fix is in i'm going where i don't belong

sweet nothing is a something in me
sweet nothing is a something in me
sweet nothing, pretty nothing

when you go talking trash i'm surprised at what you say
why you wanna keep these lies on parade
nothing's gonna make me shy... away

i know how to turn others inside out
i can't stand by here waiting while you dumb me down
i fit the perfect picture that you want for all
the fix is in i'm going where i don't belong
