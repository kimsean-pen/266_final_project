Hello
Hi, it's me.
(What do you want?)
I thought I'm gonna phone to talk things over.
(After, what you've done,
I've got nothing to say to you.)
After what we've been through,
you've got to give me another chance.
(Oh do I?)
Yes, because it's me. I thought you love me.
(Yes... i do.)
I want you - Now and forever
(Then why did you do it!)
I miss you - Now that you've gone
(I'm not a type of girl to mess around with!)
I just called to say: I really love you
(You should have thought of that before!)
And girl, I do regret every single word that I said.

The night is so empty without you,
and lonelyness's falling upon my mind.
I'm trying to touch you in my dreams.
My heart is crying - baby...

Oooh, how I need you
Oooh, how I need you

I'm waiting every nighttime.
(My nights have been so lonely since you've been gone)
I'll kiss you and hold you tight.
(I dream about this feeling every night)
What I mean is: girl, I really changed now.
(I'd really love to believe you!)
I swear to you, I do! Girl, I'll never make you blue.

Oooh, how I need you

- I really love you.
- I really love you.
- Really changed now...
