I've worked in this factory far too long
Can't remember when I last had
Some time to breathe and be on my own
And to do things just for a laugh
To be a clown, to paint the town
Where the sunshine can heal my bones
In five more days I'll be on my way
Then my fantasies will unfold

'Cause there are five more days 'til summer
Takes me away
There are five more days 'til summer
Five more days 'til summer
Five more days 'til summer
Takes me away

I work on the night shift until the dawn
My whole life has been in the dark
I sleep all day 'til the moon's in play
Like a vampire in a box
Without a sound, no one around
I awaken to feel the cold
To do again just like yesterday
With this emptiness in my soul

But there are five more days 'til summer
Takes me away
There are five more days 'til summer
Five more days 'til summer
Five more days 'til summer
Takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away

There are five more days 'til summer
Takes me away
There are five more days 'til summer
Five more days 'til summer
Five more days 'til summer
Takes me away

One, two, three, four, five days 'til summer
One, two, three, four, five days 'til summer
One, two, three, four, five days 'til summer
One, two, three, four, five days 'til summer

Five more days 'til summer
Five more days 'til summer
Five more days 'til summer
Takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away
