Some folks like to get away
Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to miami beach or to hollywood
But I'm takin' a greyhound
On the hudson river line
I'm in a new york state of mind
Seen all those movie stars
And their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the rockies, under the evergreens
But I know what I'm needin'
And I don't wanna waste more time
I'm in a new york state of mind
It was so easy livin' day by day

Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The new york times and the daily news
Comes down to reality
And it's fine with me cause I've let it slide
I don't care if it's chinatown or up on riverside
I don't have any reasons
I've left them all behind
I'm in a new york state of mind
I don't have any reasons
Cause left them all behind
I'm in a new york, I'm in a new york state of mind...
