Behold our beloved revels in tragedy (in tragedy)
Self-denying avarice for bloodshed, behold
Hypocrite
Those who run will be burned
Those who run will be burned
Those who run will be burned
Those who run will be burned

Devoutly wished for blinded eyes
This tragedy's like light to flies
It seems to suit you better
Bleeding out the eyes (bleeding out the eyes)
Hopes left in chain suspension
Holding onto lies to make the truth
