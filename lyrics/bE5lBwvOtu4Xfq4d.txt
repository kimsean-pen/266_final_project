When we feel safe
The rain escapes
Waiting in vain
As water climbs our frame
Drown in this state
Please pull me away
I've known dread to this day
Teach me to swim

Hold my breath to the last drop
I'll breathe with you 'til we stop
Will your silence distract me
From overreacting?

Ooh, there's so much to say
When time is our enemy
Ooh we embrace pains

Will you keep me?
Will you keep me sane?
Will you keep me sane?
Will you keep me sane?
Will you keep me?
Will you keep me sane?

In state of grace
Desire hangs
Spellbound in space
We absolve our pain
I've lived in shade
Afraid of change
'Til I let your tide overtake
And pour me into the break

Hold my breath to the last drop
Will your silence distract me?

Ooh, there's so much to say
When time is our enemy
Ooh we embrace pains

Will you keep me?
Will you keep me sane?
Will you keep me sane?
Will you keep me sane?
Will you keep me?
Will you keep me sane?

Ooh, I have so much to say
When time is our enemy
Will you keep me sane?

Will you keep me?
Will you keep me sane?
Will you keep me sane?
Will you keep me sane?
Will you keep me?
Will you keep me sane?

Will you keep me?
Will you keep me?
Will you keep me?
