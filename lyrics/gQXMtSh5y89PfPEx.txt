suppose my life has its plans
i choose to have women write my plan
and i have my reasons
they'll write that list
of all that i should be
and perfect men would never be
jealous or desperate
my ghost and i in our grave will lie
and we'll read that plan
on how to be perfect men
if anyone succeeds you
this will be her song to know that
i will get it wrong (x2)
be mine
till you're reminded of something better
be mine
until it comes along
be mine
till you're reminded of something better
be mine
until it comes along
