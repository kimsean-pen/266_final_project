Remember those dark nights down Brickfield
Never a blade in sight... (Brickfield Nights)
No youth club, no coffee bar
Saturday was the local cinema night... (Brickfield Nights)

Every night we'd meet at the same place same time...
Late nights spent kicking round a football
We carved our initials on the school wall

Remember those Brickfield Nights
Remember those Brickfield Nights
It seems so long, those days are gone
Dark nights down Brickfield

On summer nights like a sauna
We always met by the corner light... (Brickfield Nights)
Then the girls came with their long hair
High heels and the make up never quite right... (Brickfield Nights)

Every night we'd meet at the same place same time...
Saturdays at the local dance hall
They carved our initials on the school wall
