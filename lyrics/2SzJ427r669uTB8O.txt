A compromise
Between honesty and lies
To lead me past
Their sly disguise

My moves are slow
But soon they'll know
My moves are slow
But soon they'll know

Behind the scenes
They grow their schemes
Hiding intentions
Revealing only fractions

Their moves are slow
But soon you'll know
Their moves are slow
But soon you'll know

They'll keep on whispering their mantras
We'll keep on whispering our mantras
They'll keep on whispering their mantras
We'll keep on whispering our mantras

My moves are slow
But soon they'll know
Their moves are slow
But soon you'll know

They'll keep on whispering their mantras
We'll keep on whispering our mantras
They'll keep on whispering their mantras
We'll keep on whispering our mantras
