Don't ya know
Don't ya know that I'll be there
It's killing me
Everywhere
You're everywhere that I turn to
I will not admit
No, I won't
I won't miss you
Can't go thru this again
Don't ya know
Don't ya know that I'll be there
Lift us with your love
Lift us with your love
Into the gold
Into the gold
Into the golden sunlight
Lift us with your love
Lift us with your love
Into the gold
Into the gold
Into the golden sunlight
You are the only one
That I can rely on
You see, I doubted too much
Pushing me up to the skyline
When you're alone
Don't we know I'll come back
It's killing me
Everywhere
You're everywhere that I turn to
(Lift me up with your love)
(Lift me up with your love)
Lift us with your love
Lift us with your love
Into the gold
Into the gold
Into the golden sunlight
Lift us with your love
Lift us with your love
Into the gold
Into the gold
Into the golden sunlight
Lift us with your love
Lift us with your love
Lift us with your love
Lift us with your love
Into the gold
Into the gold
Into the golden sunlight
Lift us with your love
Lift us with your love
Into the gold
Into the gold
Into the golden sunlight
