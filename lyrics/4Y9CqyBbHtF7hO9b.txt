Passed out in our school clothes so we'd wake up in our Sunday's best
I never asked for your opinion, I just got it and I get it
You move slow like daytime drama
And I'm boring like his songs
So while I'm taking you for granted
We'll be humming along

Well cross my heart and hope to...
I'm lying just to keep you here
So reckless (so reckless), so
So thoughtless (so thoughtless)
So careless, I could care less

Well cross my heart and hope to...
I'm lying just to keep you here
(So reckless)I'll keep you here
(So thoughtless)
But, I could care less

So paint your face up something elegant
And this town maybe a darker shade of red
Cause a long night means a fist fight
Against your pillow and my pearly whites
I want to hear you scream you like me better on my knees
So let us pray
(We don't believe in second chances)
So let us pray

Don't you ask me
Don't you move (anywhere)

Cross my heart and hope to
I'm lying just to keep you here
So reckless (so reckless), so
So thoughtless (so thoughtless)
So careless, I could care less

Well Cross my heart and hope to
I'm lying just to keep you here
(So reckless)I'll keep you here
(So thoughtless)
But, I could care less

Well cross my heart and hope to
I'm lying just to keep you here (I'll keep you here, I'll keep you here)

One of us never said it but we're taking it all (Well cross my heart and hope to)
And tell me why you never promised that you wanted it all (I'm lying just to keep you here.)
And her eyes never batted when she said it
It's a long night, open, knowing...

This glass house is burning down (open all night, knowing...)
You light the match, I'll stick around (open all night, knowing...)
I'll give you everything you want (open all night, knowing...)
And wish the worst of what I was (open all night, knowing...)

This glass house is burning down (open all night, knowing...) (Tonight won't make a difference.)
You light the match, I'll stick around (open all night, knowing...) (Tonight won't make a difference.)
I'll give you everything you want (open all night, knowing...) (Tonight won't make a difference.)
And wish the worst of what I was (open all night, knowing...) (Tonight won't make a difference.)

Tonight won't make a difference
Tonight won't make a difference
Tonight won't make a difference
Well tonight won't make a difference
Well tonight won't make a difference
Tonight won't make a difference
Tonight won't make a difference
Well tonight won't make a difference
