Oh my holy Lord!
She sets my soul on fire
Flames of love and sweet perfume
She's my heart's desire
She's an angel straight from Hell
Draws me to the deep
In the darkness, way below
It's my heart she'll keep

Thunder underground
Watch the castle fall
Sound of wind, it takes the sky
Winter takes us all
Mountain-eye it hits the sky
Watches as we pray
Laughing out and smiling proud
This is where we lay

Lover
Leaver
Taker
Believer

Oh God! Hellfire
Witch of Endor raised
Saul did fall to his knees
Watched the fire blaze
Satan plays his flute for him
The sound it burns his ears
Watches as a piece of man
Slips and disappears

Lover
Leaver
Taker
Believer
