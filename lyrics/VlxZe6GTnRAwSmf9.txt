Take heed, beware
There's something in the air
Grown to an almighty size
It's loud and it gleams
And with fury it screams
See the big pumpkin arise

From out of sight it's been
But growing deep within
To boiling point excited
The fire is ignited

Here we are, here we go
Shout it out, let them know
Like a bright shinning star
Pumpkins united we are

We're red hot
Red hot

Beware, beware
Something's in the air
The Halloween monsters arise
The pieces brought back from the book of the dead
By Doctor Stein brought back to life

Oh my god, we burn
The point of no return
To pleasure pint excited
The fire is ignited

Here we are, here we go
Shout it out, let them know
We're a light in the dark
Pumpkins united we are
And we're riding the sky like the eagle
We wake up the mountain afar
We're blasting the walls down in Jericho
Pumpkins united we are
Pumpkins united

Red hot, red hot, red hot, ah
Red hot, red hot, red hot, ah
Red hot
Red hot

Sing it high, sing it low
Shout it out, let them know
We're a light in the dark
United we are
And we're riding the sky like the eagle
We wake up the mountain afar
We're blasting the walls down in Jericho
Pumpkins united we are

United we are
Red hot
Red hot
Red hot (united)
Red hot
Red hot (we're united)
Red hot
Red hot (united)
Red hot
