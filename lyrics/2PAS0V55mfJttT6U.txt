From the window ledge I fall, watch my necktie whip back in the wind.
From the top of an office building, I can't even see why I should live.
"Don't give up", they all say. But I'm not giving up anything anyway.
On the way down, I see your face laughing at one of my idiot boy mistakes.
Well you can laugh now, 'cause it's over. Have one last laugh watching me go to waste.
'cause I don't need a reason why, does anyone?
