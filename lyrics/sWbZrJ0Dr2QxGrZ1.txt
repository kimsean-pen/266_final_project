Floating in red again
A deepened soil
Nothing
Empty cup
Trade not known

Showing promise of a perfect land
No regrets for a fallen ground
The omen passed woman possessed
Reflect on the duties held

Oceans morph to dust
Chasing the timeline
Bolts of light flash
Original storm god

The atmosphere that floats above the earth
Is corrupt for man This we know
What has dwelt within the early dawn
Has gone away That's okay

Dig
Climb
Ancient elm
Root
Ride the vine of father ground
Our carving

Circle
Made of ash
Betray her presence
Huntress
Gentle breath
Listen to the poison rose
