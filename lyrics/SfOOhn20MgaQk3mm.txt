How many more year
Have you got to wreck my life?
How many more year
Have you got to wreck my life?
Well, the way you done me
Gonna wreck my life

How many more time
You"re gonna treat me like you do?
How many more time
You"re gonna treat me like you do?
You spend all my money
All my lovin' too

Now I'm old and grey
Got no place to go
Now I'm old and grey
Got no place to go
You got yourself a youngster
You can't stand me no more
