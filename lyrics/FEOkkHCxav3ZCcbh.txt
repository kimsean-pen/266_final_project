Now I'm in your basement
I'm laying low to keep out of your way
I hear your footsteps
Move the floorboards above my head
I have my own routine now
I'm keeping busy in my own way
I'm learning ways to not feel
Like I'm down here forever

I hear your footsteps
Move the floorboards above my head
I hope you know that I'm down here
Just for you

I sang a song to you through the floor
To reach you upstairs
I thought I heard you call out for more
I know that's crazy
I'm pretty sure that I'm lost again
It won't get through to you
I won't get through
I think I won't get through

I'm gonna close my mouth now
You don't need more noise in your life
I miss you more than you know
But I know time makes you move on
I hear your footsteps
Move the floorboards above my head
I hope you know that I'm down here
Just for you

I sang a song to you through the floor
To reach you upstairs
I thought I heard you call out for more
I know that's crazy
I'm pretty sure that I'm lost again
It won't get through to you
I won't get through
I think I won't get through

The lights are off
And I'm lost again
[x6]
The Lights are off
