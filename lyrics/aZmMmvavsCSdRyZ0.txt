Back in the 80's both me and my sister are given a personal Walkman
And it was a really big thing
I mean, for both of us
But it was especially a big thing for my sister
She loved house music and listening to stations in Manchester
Would make her own house mixtapes from the radio
And would listen to them obsessively
When she could make her own cassettes
And play them over and over
She would dance endlessly in her bedroom

Beulah loves dancing
Has always loved music yeah

Now most times when Beulah's upstairs dancing
I-I'd be downstairs watching telly with my mom and dad
I must have been about thirteen, yeah
And I kid you not, the whole house would be shaking
But it's not a big house
And especially banging was the living room door
And me dad'd sit there
And he, he tried to be as patient as he could
But there'd be a point where he'd look over at me mum
Then he'd be like, "Janet, I'm gonna go up and say something"
And me mom had looked at him and she's been like
"Don't you say a word!"
