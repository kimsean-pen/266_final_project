Thought it was dead and buried
Then it woke you up last night
Sought it so damn worried
You've been tossin' turnin'

both ends burnin'
I
Want to put your mind at ease again
Make everything alright

I know it's getting underneath your skin
I try to tell you now
Don't look over your shoulder
'Cause that's just the ghost of me

You're seeing in your dreams
Wait
There's no rhyme or reasons

Sometimes there's no meaning
In the visions when you're sleeping
Don't wake up and believe that
You're looking at the ghost of me

You're looking at the ghost of me
Your imagination
And emotion's running wild
Fueling my frustration

Like a fire burning
Clock is turning
I
I know it's getting underneath your skin

I try to tell you now
Don't look over your shoulder
'Cause that's just the ghost of me
You're seeing in your dreams

Wait
There's no rhyme or reasons
Sometimes there's no meaning
In the visions when you're sleeping
Don't wake up and believe that
You're looking at the ghost of me
Whoa
Yeah, you're looking at the ghost of me
Yeah, you're looking at the ghost of me
Don't look over your shoulder
'Cause that's just the ghost of me
You're seein'
Wait
There's no rhyme or reasons
Sometimes there's no meaning
In the visions when you're sleeping
Don't wake up and believe that
Visions when you're sleeping
Don't wake up and believe that
You're looking at the ghost of me
Yeah, you're looking at the ghost of me
Yeah, you're looking at the ghost of me
