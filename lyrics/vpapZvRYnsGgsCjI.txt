It's certainly true, there's better things to do.
And though I don't know everything,
I wouldn't tell you anything if I did.

The last time I saw you act like this we were kids.
The last time I saw you act like this we were kids.

What am I to do?
My heart goes out to you.
Though I don't know everything
I wouldn't tell you anything if I did.

Over reacting, over again... just between friends.
What am I to do?
I won't come between you two.
(What was I to say?)
(What was I to do?)
I gave it, I gave it all, all I could, all I could

Over reacting, over again... just between friends.
I'll bet you never find another friend like me.

What was I to do? I gave in.
What was I to say? I gave it all I could, all I could, all I could.
