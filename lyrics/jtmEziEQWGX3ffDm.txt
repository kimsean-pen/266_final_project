Do the twist, twist for Ice-Cream
C'mon dance, Misdirection
You can take new nicks for Blue Jeans
But its 3 if you're dead

We are trapped, make it violent
The most bright, I'm assuming
Love the smell of your bath
(Back)
Sci-Fi
Half-Time
Mr. you're on fire Mr.
(No sir I'm okay)

By the seaside, near the seashore
Thats where I got lost

We are trapped, make it violent
The most bright, I'm assuming
Love the smell of your bath
(Back)
Sci-Fi
Half-Time
Mr. you're on fire Mr.
(No sir I'm okay)
