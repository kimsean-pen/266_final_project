Oh, give us your vote
Give us your vote
If you know what's good for you

Oh, give us your vote
Give us your vote
If you know what's good for you

These are the lines
That we straighten every year
And it's the second time

[Incomprehensible]

Your future's with us

Oh, give us your vote
Give us your vote

Your English is good
We can see it in your bones
