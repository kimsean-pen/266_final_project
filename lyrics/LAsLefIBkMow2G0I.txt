Wait For something more
Wait You show
I follow

The beacon is calling me
the light that never dies
reflections thrown above the sea
casts shadows in the sky

Standing right in front of you
Is where I need to be
Reliving this is something new
And something finally

Take the deep end
And swim 'til you can stand
Cause it will make a difference in the end

Trip the shudder
And keep the picture close
Save it until you need it the most

(I'm coming home)
I'm coming home
