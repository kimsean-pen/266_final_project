Beware beware, be skeptical
The smiles, the smiles, the painted gold
Deceit so natural
But a wolf in sheep's clothing is more than a warning
Bla bla black sheep, have you any soul?
No sir, by the way what the hell are mortals?
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jill's a little whore and her alibies are turning tricks
So could you...

Tell me how you're sleeping easy, how you're only thinking of yourself
Show me, how you justify-y, telling all your lies like second nature
Listen, mark my words one day (one day) you will pay, you will pay
Karma's gonna come collect your debt!

Oh well, oh well you stalk your prey with criminal mentality
You sink your teeth into the people you depend on; infecting everyone you're quite the problem
Fee fi fo fum, better run and hide, I smell the blood of a petty little coward
Jack be lethal, Jack be slick
Jill will leave you lonely dying in a filthy ditch
So could you...

Tell me how you're sleeping easy, how you're only thinking of yourself
Show me, how you justify-y, telling all your lies like second nature
Listen, mark my words one day (one day) you will pay, you will pay
Karma's gonna come collect your debt!

Maybe you'll change
Abandon all your wicked ways
Make amend and start anew again
Maybe you'll see, all the wrongs you did to me
And start all over, start all over

Ha ha, who am I kidding? Now let's not get overzealous here,
you've always been a huge piece of shit.
If I could kill you I would, but it's frowned upon in all 50 states.
Having said that, burn in hell... ha ha ha ha ha

So tell me how you're sleeping easy, how you're only thinking of yourself
Show me, how you justify-y, telling all your lies like second nature
Listen, mark my words one day (one day) you will pay, you will pay
Karma's gonna come collect your debt!
Karma's gonna come collect your debt!
(oh, oh, oh)
Karma's gonna come collect your debt!
