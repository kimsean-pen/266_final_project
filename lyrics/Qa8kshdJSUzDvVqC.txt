I be on the hotline, like err'day
Making sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low
Rocking my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio
Turning up my radio

I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
Whenever I hear that sound
Whenever I hear that sound

The only one that papa allowed to hang out
in my room with the door closed
We'd be alone
And mama never freaked out
when she heard it go boom-- 'Cause she knew we were in the zone

Hold him in my arms
and look out on my window at the moonlight
And he, deep, keepin' me close so I never let him go
He's got a place in my heart

I think I'm in love with my radio
Because it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
Whenever I hear that sound
Whenever I hear that sound
