Oh, it's ever so funny
Cause I don't think you're special
I don't think you're cool
You're just probably all right
But under these lights you look beautiful

And I'm strugglin'
I can't see through your fake tan
Yeah, you know it for a fact
That everybody's eatin' out of your hands

But what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing!
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Said you don't know nothing!

Well, fancy seein' you in here
You're all tarted up and you don't look the same
Well, I haven't seen ya since last year
Yeah, surprisingly you have forgotten my name

But you know it, yeah you knew it all along
Oh, and you say you have forgotten
But you're fibbing, go on, tell me I'm wrong

So what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing!
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing, no!

I say what do you know?
That you dont know nothing, no!
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
I said what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing!

I fancy you with a passion
You're a Topshop princess, a rock star too
But you're a fad, you're a fashion
And I'm having a job trying to talk to you
But it's all right, put it all on one-side
Oh, cause everybody's lookin'
You've got control of everyone's eyes
Including mine
