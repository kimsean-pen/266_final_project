My baby's riding shotgun
Singing just a little off key
Her feet on the dashboard
Tapping out the back beat

The song on the radio
Is talking about the love we make
I know just what she's thinking
And I can't wait

Oh, my sweet love, keep singing me home
Keep singing, love, keep singing
Oh my sweet love, keep singing me home
Keep singing, love, keep singing

Her tanline's showing
At the waist of her cutoff jeans
Her damp hair blowing out the window
In the summer breeze

Got the sunshine shining through the windshield
Got a hand on her leg the other on the wheel

My sweet love, keep singing me home
Keep singing, love, keep singing
Oh, my sweet love, keep singing me home
Keep singing, love, keep singing

Oh, and when we get together
The love we make together it blows my mind
Every time we touch
Oh, I can't get enough

So slide on in a little closer
And lay your head here on my shoulder

Oh, my sweet love, keep singing me home
Keep singing, love, keep singing
Oh my sweet love, keep singing me home
Keep singing, love, keep singing

Oh, oh my sweet love keep singing me home
Oh, my sweet love keep singing me home
Keep singing, love, keep singing me home

Sunshine's shining through the windshield
Got a hand on her leg, the other on the wheel
Love, love, love, love, love
Sing me home, why don't you sing me home

That's right
