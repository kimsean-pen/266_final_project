Picture this
You're just a kid.
They never noticed you, because no one ever did
You don't know why
But you don't mind.
Your life already gives you a hard time.
They saw you your whole life
Less like an underdog
More like garbage.
Do they know what it's like
To spend every single day with a back like a target?

Trust me I know when you look at me
You see nobody at all.
For the first time I can say that I'm proud to be
Nodoby at all.

We'll never be
We'll never see
Never believe
The fucking lies they tell themselves.

Don't tell me who to be.
I put my faith in those
Who are just like me.
We have no face.
We have no name.
And we never needed any of you anyway.
Any of you anyway!

Trust me I know when you look at me
You see nobody at all.
For the first time I can say that I'm proud to be
Nodoby at all.

Proud to be nobody.
We never needed any of you anyway.
Proud to be nobody.
We never needed any of you anyway.
Any of you anyway!

Trust me I know when you look at me
You see nobody at all.
For the first time I can say that I'm proud to be
Nodoby at all.

We'll never be
We'll never see
Never believe
The fucking lies they tell themselves.
