I was born on the highway
In a trainwreck
With a heart that was beating
Outta my chest

So now I follow it around the world
I can't keep up if I don't get it soon
I know I'll bleed until I drop

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

There's a darkness and a hollow
O the highway
Every cross on the roadside
Tells a story

So now I follow it around the world
I can't keep up
The story never ends as long as we have
Blood and cuts

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

can't get enough
I can't get enough

It ran off the track, 11/79, while the immigrants slept
There wasn't much time
The mayor came calling and got â€˜em outta bed
They packed up their families and headed up wind

A poison cloud, a flaming sky
200, 000 people and no one died
And all before the pocket dial
Yeah

I keep searching and searching
I keep searching and searching

Now I'm stranded, tied on the tracks
There's no hero, there's no villain
There's nobody I can blame, the story's still the same
I'm never satisfied
It's a problem with my brain

I keep searching and searching
I keep searching and searching

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

can't get enough
I can't get enough
