I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
And some kind of madness has started to evolve
And I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah

I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized what you mean

And now I need to know is this real love
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?
And when I look back at all the crazy fights we've had
Like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah

Now, I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized what you need

But now I have finally seen the end
(Finally seen the end)
And I'm not expecting you to care, no
(Expecting you to care)
That I have finally seen the light
(Finally seen the light)
And I have finally realized
(Realized)
I need your love
I need your love

Come to me, just in a dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes, I know I can be wrong
And baby you're too headstrong
Our love is
Madness
