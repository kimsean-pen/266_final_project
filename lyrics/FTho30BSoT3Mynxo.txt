Wake up
You know I feel ok
Go to sleep
It's just another day
I know
Someday you'll find me
Where I
I least expect it
My doctor says
That I should take it
At least I won't
Have to keep faking
I know
Someday you'll find me
Where I
I least expect it
Today I know I feel ok
Baby look at me with those eyes of gray
But I'll keep trying to stay this way
I know it's love that's got me feeling ok
I took my own
Advice for once
I gave it up
I gave it up
I know
Someday you'll find it
Where I
I least expect it
Today I know I feel ok
Baby look at me with those eyes of gray
When I get down I get so down
But I'll keep trying to stay this way
I know it's love that's got me feeling ok
Feeling ok
Feeling ok (e-a-e-a-e-a)
Feeling ok (e-a-e-a-e-a)
Feeling ok
