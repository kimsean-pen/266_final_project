Stuck on the dark side of the moon
Stuck on the dark side, dark side

Our sadness was like
Two ships in the night, ships in the night, passing
Both needing a lighthouse
We were yearning for light, yearning for light
Fill the ocean with tears only I came aground
And if I close my eyes now
I can still hear the sound, I can still hear the sound

There's a message at the bottom of this bottle
And it's calling out to me
There's a message at the bottom of this bottle
Singing I can set you free

My friend, I'll forever have you on repeat
Stuck on the dark side of the moon
Your sadness I hear echoing in the ether
You were the light in every room
If I close my eyes, I can hear you
Like you're singing next to me, you're next to me
Oh, brother, I hear you, I still hear you calling
"I have finally found some peace"

Brother, I still hear you calling
Never been so aware that I'm falling
Brother, I still hear you calling
Never been so aware that I'm falling
Stuck here, I'm forever mourning on the dark side of the moon

There's a message at the bottom of this bottle
And it's calling out to me
There's a message at the bottom of this bottle
Saying I can set you free
There's a message at the bottom of this bottle
Stuck on the dark side of the moon
There's a message at the bottom of this bottle
Stuck on the dark side of the moon

Stuck on the dark side of the moon
Stuck on the dark side, dark side
