I wanna make a deal with you girl
and get it signed by the heads of state
I wanna make a deal with you girl
be recognized round the world
It's my nonalignment pact
Nonalignment pact
Sign it!
Nonalignment pact

At night I can see the stars on fire
I can see the world in flames
And it's all because of you
or your thousand other names
Peggy
Carrie Ann
and Betty Jean
Jill
Jan
Joan
and Sue
Alice
Cindy
Barbara Ann
It's all because of you
It's all because of you girl!
It's all because of you
It's all because of you girl!
Sign my nonalignment pact
Nonalignment pact!
It's my
nonalignment pact
