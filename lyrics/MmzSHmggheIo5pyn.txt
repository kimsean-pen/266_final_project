She fell to the bottom of her life
This wasn't meant for two
She struggles to find herself in time but she can barely move

Just try and get up
You've gotta slowly brush off
I know that words aren't enough but you're better than this

Save your heart for someone that's worth dying for
Don't give it away
Torn apart, never getting what you've been crying for
It's always the same

She turns the pages everyday
Just to change the mood
But every chapter reads the same
So hard to make it through

Just try and get up
You've gotta slowly brush off
I know that words aren't enough but you're better than this

Save your heart for someone that's worth dying for
Don't give it away
Torn apart, never getting what you've been crying for
It's always the same

And you give (and you give)
And they take (and they take)
And it's love that you want but not love that you make

Save your heart for someone that's worth dying for
Don't give it away
Save your heart for someone who leaves you breathless
And I know that you're scared
Seems like someone said you had it in you
All along you said you knew this was wrong but still worth dying for

Save your heart for someone who leaves you breathless
And I know that you're scared
Seems like someone said you had it in you (are you scared?)
All along you said you knew this was wrong but still worth dying for

And you give (and you give)
And they take (and they take)
And it's love that you want but not love that you make
Save your heart for someone that's worth dying for
Don't give it away.
