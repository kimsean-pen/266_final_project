I've been worried 'bout the wrong thing, too long
Sitting on the wrong thing, too long
I don't give a fuck no more
Don't give no fucks no more
Imma do it my way, my way
What you gonna, gonna say?
Oh, yeah
Tell me what to do
I'll walk away from you
I'll walk away from you
'Cause I'm worried 'bout the wrong thing, too long
Worried 'bout the bad things, oh no
What you gonna do?
Imma just live my life
The way that I want to
And Imma do my stupid shit, my space
I'll do what I want to, ooh
I know I'm a fucking problem
I know this is what they say
Well I'm just living my life
Gonna live it my way, my way
Ain't nobody perfect, I know I do wrong
On this land walking, we're all flesh and bones
Learnin' on the way, just learnin' on the way
Imma just live my life
The way that I want to
And Imma do my stupid shit, my space
I'll do what I want to, ooh
I know I'm a fucking problem
I know this is what they say
Well I'm just living my life
Gonna live it my way, my way
I've been worried 'bout the wrong thing, too long
Sitting on the wrong thing, too long
I don't give a fuck no more
Don't give no fucks no more
Imma do it my way, my way
What you gonna, gonna say?
Oh, yeah
Tell me what to do
I'll walk away from you
I'll walk away from you
I'll walk away from you
I've been worried 'bout the wrong thing, too long
Sitting on the wrong thing, too long
I don't give a fuck no more
I know I'm a fucking problem
I know this is what they say
Well I'm just living my life
Gonna live it my way, my way
I know I'm a fucking problem
I know this is what they say
Well I'm just living my life
Gonna live it my way, my way
They say that I'm a problem, oh yeah
