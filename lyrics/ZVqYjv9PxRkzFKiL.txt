Gather 'round all you fire-starters
Whirlwind reapers and comet riders
Come sons of Remus
The beast now calls
Wolf sire children
Daughters of Rome - come!

Gather 'round all you fire starters
Whirlwind reapers and comet riders

Come sons of Remus
The beast now calls
Wolf sire children
Daughters of Rome - come!

Come all you mountain lions
Come to our mountain fire
Come and heed the call
We are what you're looking for

Come all you wild wolves
Women with sharpened claws
Come to our mountain fire
We have what you're looking for
Yes, you are what we're looking for

Gather 'round all you fire-starters
Whirlwind reapers and comet riders
Come to our mountain hall
Come and heed the call
Come all you immoral seizers
Fire starters and whirlwind reapers!
