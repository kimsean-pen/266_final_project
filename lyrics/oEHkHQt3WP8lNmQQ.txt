Yes, to the darkest place that we know
Outside of the rider's domain
To the heart of the wood
To the hidden places beyond the briar thickets

The dance must begin as dusk gathers around

Our skin drum and rattle
know the tune
jaw bone driven through
the skull of a great foe
bested with wooden spear
the tip hardened in fire

Bathe in the clear cold stream
Fresh water from the unsullied endless spring that flows from the
mountain
We will sing the most ancient song
Spark the fire upon dry tinder

The dance must begin as dusk gathers around

Our skin drum and rattle
know the tune
jaw bone driven through
the skull of a great foe
bested with wooden spear
the tip hardened in fire
