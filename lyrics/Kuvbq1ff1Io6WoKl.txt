In the bat of an eye
You always think about yourself
And I don't believe all the lies coming out of my mouth
Try to forget all the things that I did to myself
And in time, I see it fading

One of these things just doesn't belong here
Hey, look at that girl
I just don't belong here
Hey, look at that girl

Aphrodite tonight
She's lifting up her dress and child
Her stomach is so tight
And she feels herself fading

One of these things just doesn't belong here
Hey, look at that girl
I just don't belong here
Hey, look at that girl

And I'll try to catch my own vibe
Leave behind countryside
Ooh I'll be when I'll be
'Cause it's my ride 'till I decide...

One of these things just doesn't belong here
Hey, look at that girl
I just don't belong here
Hey, look at that girl

One of these things just doesn't belong here
Hey, look at that girl
I just don't belong here
Hey, look at that girl
Look at what she wears...
