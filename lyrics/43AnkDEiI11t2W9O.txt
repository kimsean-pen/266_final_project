Stabbing himself in the shins there
Cos he's never been keen on letting up
His shoulders are sinking cos he's dying to stay out
And I wanted him so long if I could choose
You're scared of the dark
You're scared of the darkness
But he's ever so scared when your phone cuts
Show a face, show a place

Well they are coming after me
Well they are coming after me
And he is coming after me
And she is coming back to me, me

Gravedweller
You're feeling at home
Pressed up on the stones
And the soils alone
Gravedweller
Make sure you bury me
Next to the family
Who resembles me
