My days have grown so lonely
For you I cry
For you, dear, only
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you
Body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
Oh I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you
Body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd throw away romance
Are you pretending?
It looks like the ending
Unless I can have one more chance to prove, dear

My life a hell you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you
Body and soul

What lies before me
A future that's stormy
A winter that's grey and cold
Unless there's magic, the end will be tragic
And echo a tale that's been told so often

My life revolves about you
What earthly good am I without you?
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul
