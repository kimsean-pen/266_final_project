La la la la, La la la la, La la la la, La la la
La la la la, La la la la, La la la la la

Eat, sleep, breathe it
You're full of the stuff
Go bag it, tie it up tight
Wheat, meat, dairy free, t-total happy-clappy
High on life
You should try it you know

Go on while no one's looking

Aha! Gotcha now
Caught red handed in the biscuit tin
Cost you to keep me quiet

Golden boy boots
Pocket pedal stool
Picking sharp smart moves
Plastic, tin can, paper separator
Busy bee wave, wave save the planet flag
But sneaky in suburbia

Aha! Candid camera
Hook, line and sinker
For the four-wheel drive
Cost you to keep me quiet
Keep me quiet (keep me quiet)

Nicest, sweetest
Upmost in everythingest
So charming, very charming
Well read, can play the fool
No one's ill at ease
And put their deepest Swiss bank trust in you

No one saw it coming
Aha! Aha! Aha!
You killed a man
Cost you to keep me quiet

Oi!
