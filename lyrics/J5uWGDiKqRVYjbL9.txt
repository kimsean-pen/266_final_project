Love, let my nightmares
Turn into dreams
Love, let the angels into my sleep

Love, let the spirit
Fly out of me
Love, let my love inside go free

Love, let my anger
Turn into peace
Love, let the doves cry out in the streets
Love, let the poison bleed out of me
Love, let my love inside go free

A bloody war
Behind my eyes
I come out right on the other side

Just close the door and shut the blinds
I'll come out right on the other side

Love, let my nightmares turn into dreams
Love, let the angels into my sleep
Love, let the spirit fly out of me
Love, let my love inside go free

Love, let my anger
Turn into peace
Love, let the doves cry out in the streets
Love, let the poison bleed out of me
Love, let my love inside go free
