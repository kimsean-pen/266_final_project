Bitch
Big truck
Too small, too small, don't compromise
So have fast, too fast don't realize
Have hand on wheel, set the sights, drive with me

Too fast, too fast, don't realize
So have fast, too fast don't recognize
Have hand on wheel, set the sights, drive with me

Moving - motion
Said move, said move it

Somebody better come and drive me

Big truck

Ain't no grave gonna hold my body down
Ain't no grave gonna hold, hold my body, hold my body

Big truck, come on
