We had a white and blackish Sheltie
Had a name when we first got him
Shoulda taken better care of him
But he had it OK

I'm sorry when I get unruly
When you carry on so much I get a little tired
Hope you get over your teething
It's not easy when you feel sick

He had a sprightly walk you'd like him
When he keep up along your side
Wrap your peckers what he told us
Me and Mike looked at each other
Like whoa what was that then.

Derek never woke up at night
And in the morning he's ready to go
And he never had a voice like you
To scream when he wanted something
I should have been so much more willing
To help out with all the things
That a dog like you needed.

What do you
See when you
See inside of me

You can count
When you count
Count on me
What do you
See when you
See inside of me
