I've got this feeling a mile wide
I look at it a little
Each side
A portal for to climb inside
How's it feel in here?
Is the water fine?
Fine like cloth or like
Turpentine?
The pattern where our habits hide
Isn't it lovely?
I'll never hold you
To all you held me to
I wanna talk about
All the ways
Every example of
The shapes
We use to communicate
For example when
You're leaning in
To my armageddon
And then you stop
Do you also feel the weight of loss?
Isn't it lonely?
I'll never hold ya
The way you held me up
