Has anybody here seen razor face
I heard he's back looking for a place to lay down, must be getting on
Needs a man who's young to walk him round
Needs a man who's young to walk him round

Oh it must be hard for the likes of you to get by
In a world that you just can't see through and it looks so cold
How does it feel to know you can't go home?
How does it feel to know you can't go home?

Come on razor face my old friend
I'll meet you down by the truck stop inn
With a bottle of booze in the back of my car
You're a song on the lips of an aging star

Razor face, oh amazing grace
Protects you like a glove
And I'll never learn the reason why
I love your razor face
