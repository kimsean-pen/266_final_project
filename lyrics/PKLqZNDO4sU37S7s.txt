Tell the truth, no lies
I can't take it
Burned your breath, just this once
Run your mouth
I bet I can catch it
You sound just like a Judas

And if there's anything I learned
That would keep me standing
If I take you and your word
Than I'm empty handed
And tell my gut I should be burning brandy
So I can see you lie to me
I wish the air would come in red
When you breathing
And so I could have seen it coming
Look in my eyes when you say you love me
So I can see you lie to me

Lost be found
I'm a bloodhound born for seeking
Pour a pray must we die
Soon it will grow
But your act drives a beating
And now it's all off far

If there's anything I learned
That would keep me standing
If I take you and your word
Than I'm empty handed
Tell my gut should be burning brandy
So I can see you lie to me
I wish the air would come in red
When you breathing
And so I could have seen it coming
Look in my eyes when you say you love me
So I can see you lie to me
