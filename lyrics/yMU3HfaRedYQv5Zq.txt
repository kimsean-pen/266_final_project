There's a Cynical feeling saying I should give up
You said everything you'll ever say
There's a moment of panic
When I hear the phone ring
Anxiety's calling in my head
Is it back again?
Are you back again?

Don't wake me up before you leave
Is there the slightest trace of what you once believed (woah, ohh)
I feel your hand unlock the door
Leaving fingerprints of water in the oil
(woah, ohh)

What's the point of saying sorry now
Lost my voice while fighting my way out
(while fighting my way out)
What's the point of saying sorry now
(not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry)
Lost my voice while fighting my way out
(not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry now)
