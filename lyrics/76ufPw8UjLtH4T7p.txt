Babe, you're dressed to kill tonight
I get ahead of myself
If you knew what you do to me, you'll be with someone else

Jump back, be cool
You make me feel like I'm back at school
Make me crazy, crazy for you

Oh, you make me hot
Come on and show me what you got
You're moving slow, baby, don't say no
You move like a rattlesnake and I can't stand no more, oh babe

You're gonna wreck my mind
And I hope you do it all the time
You better give it your best shot
You know I'm crazy
Crazy like a fox

Don't you turn your back on me
You just make it worse
You look just as beautiful when you're movin' in reverse

Come on, be nice
Oh babe, you're gonna wreck my life
Make me crazy, make me jump all night

Oh, you make me die
When I look into your eyes
I'm moving in, I'm coming through
You must be an earthquake 'cause I'm shaking in my shoes, oh babe

You're gonna wreck my mind
I hope you do it all the time
I love your body 'cause it rocks
You make me crazy
Crazy like a fox

Come on, honey, take my hand
'Cause we're out of here
I'm gonna take you home with me, I'm gonna whisper in your ear

Come on, make it quick
Oh mama, hit me with your rhythm stick
It's magic time, but I don't play no tricks

Oh baby, come on
You know I want to get it on
You must be a guitar player
The way you're stringing me along, oh babe

You're gonna wreck my mind
And I hope you do it all the time
I'm gonna knock you out of your socks
Make me crazy
Crazy like a fox

You've been doin' it all the time
You know I love you, love you lots
Crazy like a fox

Oh, you're gonna wreck my mind
I hope you do it all the time
Love your body, it rocks
I know you're crazy
And you're a fox
