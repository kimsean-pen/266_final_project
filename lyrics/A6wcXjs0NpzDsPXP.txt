And it goes 3, 2, done
We always knew that you were the wild one
Oh, oh

But you flew too close to a burning sun
At least we got it in when we were young
I know

It still feels like yesterday
I'll love you always

Do you remember back in the day that party at Dave's?
You said that you had nothing to lose
Oh, no

Then I should've listened up, but I fucked up
Laughed it off and told you you had nothing to prove
(Had nothing to prove)
Oh, oh

It still feels like yesterday
I'll love you always

And I promise I'll see you on the other side
We'll get high and go out for another ride
I promise I'll see you on the other side

Still feels like yesterday
I'll love you always

And when my time's up
I'll come over and
Say what's up
Punch your shoulder
'Cause I'll love you always

I promise I'll see you on the other side
We'll get high and go out for another ride
I promise I'll see you on the other side

We'll get stoned
We'll get drunk
We'll get by
