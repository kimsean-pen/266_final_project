I really should just go home
And play with myself
Better that than stay
And do something else

'Cause we can't be friends, that much I know
I wish it wasn't so
And I can't take my heart some place it won't go
Show me to the door

As if a plane crash were timely
There's no good time for bad news
And these four words don't come easy
I don't love you

So listen to your friends and leave me alone
I'm just a boy, I'm drunk, I'm 24
I don't want to hurt you anymore
Don't waste your tears on me now, pretty girl
When I hate myself for letting you go
You can be the one to say "I told you so"

As if a plane crash were timely
There's no good time for bad news
These four words don't come easy
I don't love you

As if a plane crash were timely
There's no good time for bad news
These four words don't come easy
I don't love you
