This tragedy I blame myself for nothing
And all I really want is just some peace of mind
I'm sabotaged by the words unspoken
Happiness is chasing my own suicide

And I should learn to let this go
And I will never let you go
And I should learn to let this go
And I will never let you go
And I should learn to let this go
And I will never let you go
And I should learn to let this go
And I will never let you go

I think I found a way to kill the sun
I think I found a way to kill the sun

The last of me I keep inside a glass jar
Except memories of you that piece is mine
I guess I haven't gone too far
But heaven knows I fucking tried

And I should learn to let this go
And I will never let you go
And I should learn to let this go
And I will never let you go
And I should learn to let this go
And I will never let you go
And I should learn to let this go
And I will never let you go

I think I found a way to kill the sun
I think I found a way to kill the sun
I think I found a way to kill the sun
I think I found a way to kill the sun
