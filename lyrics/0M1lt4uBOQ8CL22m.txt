There's no need for introductions
No dark corridors of fame
You won't find your fortune
You might find some pain

I wanna lie, lie together
Feels like our last embrace
In a world full of confusion
Yeah, human race

But I'd rather be here than be anywhere
Is there anywhere better than here?
You know these feelings I've found, they are oh so rare
Is there anywhere better than here?

Sometimes life seems to tear us apart
I don't wanna let you go
Sometimes these feelings hit me
I start to cry 'cause I won't ever let you go

My, my, my, my, we're multiplying
Always living under some cloud
Always on the eve of destruction
Make you wanna scream out loud

And as I watch the birds soar
My lives in which it spun
My, my, my, why am I still crying?
Oh, another day has come

'Cause I'd rather be here than be anywhere
Is there anywhere better than here?
You know these feelings I've found, they are oh so rare
Is there anywhere better than here?

Sometimes life seems to tear us apart
I don't wanna let you go
Sometimes these feelings hit me
I start to cry 'cause I won't ever let you go

But I'd rather be here than be anywhere
Is there anywhere better than here?
You know these feelings I've found, they are oh so rare
Is there anywhere better than here?

But I'd rather be here than be anywhere
Is there anywhere better than here?
You know these feelings I've found, they are oh so rare
Is there anywhere better than here?

Sometimes these feelings hit me
Sometimes these feelings hit me
These feelings are oh so rare
