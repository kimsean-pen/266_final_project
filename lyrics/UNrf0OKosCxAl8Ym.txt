My ring kept him on, been learning fast
I just got you wrong, it's not built to last, it's not built to last
Time keeps on tripping on, though I learn my lessons fast
And it was time for me to cut and run
And if I ever do the past, you're not the only one, we're living

Parallel lives
Oh, you're not the only one
We're so entwined to lose it
To the passing of time
Oh, we came undone
We came untied, we came untied

We live separate lives, can't even organise
One more meeting of minds ain't gonna make it right, no
There's more humanity in just letting it be now
'Cause I can't seem to justify when we're living separate dreams
Have we forgotten love, we're lost in

Parallel lives
Oh, you're not the only one
We're so entwined to lose it
To the passing of time
Oh, we came undone
We came untied, we came untied

Parallel lives
Oh, you're not the only one
We're so entwined to choose it
To the passing of time
Oh, we came undone
We came untied, we came untied

Are we chose to give it
Are we chose to live it, our separate lives?
Got too close to heaven
But are we too driven in a parallel light?
All because we chose to live it
Are chose to give in our separate lives?
Got too close to heaven
Well, are we too driven in a parallel light?
What were we destined for, to live in

Parallel lives
Oh, you're not the only one
We're so entwined to lose it
To the passing of time
Oh, we came undone
We came untied, we came untied

Parallel lives
Oh, you're not the only one
We're so entwined to choose it
To the passing of time
Oh, we came undone
We came untied, we came untied
