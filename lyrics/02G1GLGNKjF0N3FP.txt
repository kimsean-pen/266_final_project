She said, she'll take me anyway
She'll take me every way
As long as she stays with me

She said, she'll take me everywhere
She'll take me anywhere
As long as I'm good and clean

Kiss, kiss, Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss, Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss, Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss, Molly's lips

She said, she'll take me every time
She'll take me anytime
As long as she stays with me

She said, she'll take me everyday
She'll take me any way
And it would be free

Kiss, kiss, Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss, Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss, Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss, Molly's lips

She said, she'll take me anyway
She'll take me every way
As long as she stays with me

She said, she'll take me everywhere
She'll take me anywhere
As long as I'm good and clean

Kiss, kiss, Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss, Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss, Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss, Molly's lips
