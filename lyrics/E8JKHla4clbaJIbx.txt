I'm crawling with the rats and the roaches
Never turn my back to the vultures
I'mma need to check all your coats 'cause
You never know when the enemy approaches

Who do you trust?
Tell me who do you trust?
I see 'em coming at us
But when the Molotov drops, tell me, who do you trust?

Everywhere I go, I see people passing by
They keep staring back at me like some freak in paradise
Are you people savage? Pull the knife out from my back
In the company of rich, I'll take loyalty over royalty

Who do you trust?
Tell me who do you trust?
I see 'em coming at us
But when the Molotov drops, tell me, who do you trust?
Who do you trust?
Tell me who do you trust?
I see 'em coming at us
But when the Molotov drops, tell me, who do you trust?

Caught between the thorns and the roses
People going in and out of focus
I'ma need to check all your motives
And see the fire lying under where the smoke is

Who do you trust?
Tell me who do you trust?
I see 'em coming at us
But when the Molotov drops, tell me, who do you trust?

Everywhere I go, I see people passing by
They keep staring back at me like some freak in paradise
Are you people savage? Pull the knife out from my back
In the company of rich, I'll take loyalty over royalty

Who do you trust?
Tell me who do you trust?
I see 'em coming at us
But when the Molotov drops, tell me, who do you trust?
Who do you trust?
Tell me who do you trust?
I see 'em coming at us
But when the Molotov drops, tell me, who do you trust?

Who do you trust?
Tell me who do you trust?
I see 'em coming at us
But when the Molotov drops, tell me, who do you trust?
Who do you trust?
Tell me who do you trust?
I see 'em coming at us
But when the Molotov drops, tell me who do you trust? What?

Who do you trust?
