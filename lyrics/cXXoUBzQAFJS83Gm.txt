Come on a voyage with us
Our quest is callin'
All hear the oceans howlin'
Voices of the Fallen

Under a black moon risin'
We set our sails again
Our hearts are filled with sorrow
Livin' our curse
Oh, how long must we sail
Until we're released?
Oh, set us free!
Come on a voyage with us
Our quest is callin'
All hear the oceans howlin'
Voices of the Fallen
Too long we've roamed these waters
We've blown our hearts down
Our homeland we've forgotten
All we know is gone now
Come along with us

It was a long time ago
We found the hidden gold
A treasure so excitin'
We lost our souls

Oh, now we have to sail
Until we've released
Oh, set us free!

Come on a voyage with us
Our quest is callin'
All hear the oceans howlin'
Voices of the Fallen
Too long we've roamed these waters
We've blown our hearts down
Our homeland we've forgotten
All we know is gone now

When we may go home
We'll take one final life
This blood alone
Will pay our price
Our hunger's neva endin'
Cannot be satisfied
Our thirst is eva lastin'
Within our mouths it all runs dry
Oh, we're lost!
Ghosts in the shadows.
Oh no! Creatures unhallowed
Someday in a final storm
We will get back our mortal lives again

Come on a voyage with us
Our quest is callin'
All hear the oceans howlin'
Voices of the Fallen
Too long we've roamed these waters
We've blown our hearts down
Our homeland we've forgotten
When we may go home
We'll take one final life
This blood alone
Will, will pay our
Will pay our price
