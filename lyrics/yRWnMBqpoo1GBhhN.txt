So empty like sky
Without any sun
Lotus Blossom, don't cry
You and I were meant to be one
And though we're apart
It won't be for long
I come to you
In my song

So happy we two
Like sparrows in spring
Lotus Blossom, it's true
Me and you like bow upon string
I live for the day
My journey will end
So I can touch you again

And in my dream
You are always there with me
A Tahitian fantasy...
But then the film just breaks
And I wake...

Lotus Blossom!

So empty like sky
Without any sun
Lotus Blossom, don't cry
You and I were meant to be one
And though we're apart
It won't be for long
I come to you
In my song
