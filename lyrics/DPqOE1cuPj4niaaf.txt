I'm tired of too much of this
And this is wearing me thin
There are too many hours
And too many ways to fill them in

Fine friend, you're a fine friend
When will I see
Fine friend, you're a fine friend
You've been an anchor for me

I'm tired of holding my breath
There's too much that's been left to say
But I know tomorrow the smile on your face
Will smooth these thoughts away

Fine friend you're a fine friend
When will I see
Fine friend you're a fine friend
You've been an anchor for me

Fine friend you're a fine friend
When will I see
Fine friend you're a fine friend
You've been an anchor for me

I'll never walk into your arms
I'll never walk into your arms
I'll never walk into your arms
...
