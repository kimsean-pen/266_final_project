Step lightly we might sink in
City life, my suburban love
I've been blind and numb
Wondering where all my fire's gone
Where my fire's gone

But I can't slow my thinking
A blur of streetlights
Through my tears
They're beautiful
I might crash my car
Just to feel something
Pull my world apart
Pull my world apart

Ooh-ooh, ooh
We're waltzing on
The water now
Ooh-ooh, ooh
I'm drowning here
On solid ground
Ooh-ooh, ooh
We're waltzing on
The water now
Ooh-ooh, ooh
We're fumbling on
Our common ground

(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
We're waltzing on
The water now
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
I'm drowning here
On solid ground
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh
We're waltzing on
The water now
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh
We're fumbling on
Our common ground

I'll step lightly lest I grow tired
Of the search for the cure
For apathy, was it her?
But by the time she returned
I was fast asleep, come lay with me
Come and lay with me
'Cause I can't slow my dreaming

Ooh-ooh, ooh
We're waltzing on
The water now
Ooh-ooh, ooh
I'm drowning here
On solid ground
Ooh-ooh, ooh
We're waltzing on
The water now
Ooh-ooh, ooh
We're fumbling on our
Common ground

(Waltzing on
We're waltzing on)

(Waltzing on
The water now
The water now
The water now)
I'm drowning here
On solid ground
We're waltzing on
The water now
Ooh-ooh, ooh
