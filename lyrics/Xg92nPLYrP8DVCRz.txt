I'll be stuck chasing time, running all my life
Trying not to lose a fight, burning in my eyes
In a mad mad world, I'm falling in
Little lost to go, trying to start again

Tick tock don't stop
I'm breathing

All that I see is, up down, up down
And I'm barely breathing, but I follow, follow you down
I'm on my knees and spinning, up down, up down
Still fighting my demons, but I follow, follow you down

Through the glass I lose myself, in the darkest deep
Time is just a memory, with its sun's on me
Oh, it's a mad mad world, I'm drowning in
Does anybody know, how to start again

Tick tock don't stop
I'm breathing

All that I see is, up down, up down
And I'm barely breathing, but I follow, follow you down
I'm on my knees and spinning, up down, up down
Still fighting my demons, but I follow, follow you down

Falling faster than heart's beating
Tick tock don't stop, I'm still breathing

Falling faster than heart's beat
Tick tock don't stop, I'm still breathing
Yeah, I'm still breathing

All that I see is, up down, up down
And I'm barely breathing, but I follow, follow you down
I'm on my knees and spinning, up down, up down
Still fighting my demons, but I follow, follow you down

But I follow, follow you down...
