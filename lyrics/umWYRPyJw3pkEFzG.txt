Stay alive, heaven holds, a place for us tonight, I am paralyzed.
Close your eyes, drive away, the cloud that hides the light and leave the pain, behind.
Dead alive, find a way, to bury all the lies, escape the pain, inside.
'Cause I don't want, to fall or let you go.

Love left me, hollow, I'm with you, in the end.
Cold, crippled and shallow, don't leave me here, again.

Fruit of life, I can hear, the voices of the hive, chemicals collide.
Loaded smile, light the way, for those you left behind, set the earth, on fire.
'Cause I don't want enough, I want it all.

Love left me, hollow, I'm with you, in the end.
Cold, crippled and shallow, don't leave me here, again.
I can't go on, you are bound, to break me in.
I come undone, don't you drag me, down again.

I've come, undone!

Love left me, hollow, I'm with you, in the end.
Cold, crippled and shallow, don't leave me here, again.
I can't go on, you are bound, to break me in.
I come undone, don't you drag me, down again.
