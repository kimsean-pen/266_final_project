[Kurt]
A chair is still a chair, even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house, and a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss goodnight

A room is a still a room, even when there's nothing there but gloom
But a room is not a house, and a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart

[Finn]
Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
[Kurt]
But it's just a crazy game
And when it ends, it ends in tears

So darling, have a heart, don't let one mistake keep us apart
Well I'm not meant to live alone, turn this house into a home
When I climb the stair and turn the key
Oh, please be there
Still in love with me
