Living in the dark, crazy with a spark, oh baby
Deep into the blue your love is so cruel, oh baby

So come into the night, I want to get you high, oh baby
Could you take me home? Never do me wrong, oh baby

So let me be your shadow
Let me be the only one
You give me fever, cold fever, like no one

So let me be your shadow
Let me be the only one
You give me fever, cold fever, like no one

Living in a dream
Like amphetamine inside me
The party and the crime, shining like a dime, beside me
Touch me real slow, I'm ready for the blow you gave me
Then I fall apart, look into my heart and save me

What am I gonna do with this fever inside me?
I'm acting like a fool and I follow you blindly

So let me be your shadow
Let me be the only one
You give me fever, cold fever, like no one

Living in the dark, crazy with a spark, oh baby
Deep into the blue your love is so cruel, oh baby

So let me be your shadow
Let me be the only one
You give me fever, cold fever, like no one

So let me be your shadow
Let me be the only one
You give me fever, cold fever, like no one
