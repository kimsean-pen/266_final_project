Walkin' underneath the sun
Because I don't have a place
I'm rockin' just being alone
Everyone in my face
I don't even know what they want

I'm out of time and out of space
Just trying to move it along
Get a little bit ahead of the tricks
I can't stop until I'm home

Waking up early in the morning
Staying up late every night
Disconnect the telephone
Turning off all the lights

Bouncing off the walls
They're caving in
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to begin

I'm closing down
They're closing in
No way to live
No way to win

You made a mess of my head
Now I gotta put it all back together
Piece by piece and over and over

You made a mess of my head
Now I gotta put it all back together
Piece by piece and over and over

You made a mess of my head
Now I gotta put it all back together
Piece by piece and over and over

You made a mess of my head
Now I gotta put it all back together
Piece by piece and over and over

Bouncing off the walls
They're caving in
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to begin

I'm closing down
They're closing in
No way to live
No way to win

You made a mess of my head
Now I gotta put it all back together
Piece by piece and over and over

You made a mess of my head
Now I gotta put it all back together
Piece by piece and over and over

You made a mess of my head
Now I gotta put it all back together
Piece by piece and over and over

You made a mess of my head
Now I gotta put it all back together
Piece by piece and over and over

You made a mess of my head
Now I gotta put it all back together
Piece by piece and over and over

You made a mess of my head
Now I gotta put it all back together
Piece by piece and over and over
