We started off incredible
Connection undeniable
I swear I thought you were the one forever (forever)
But your love was like a loaded gun
You shot me down like everyone
Cause everyone's replaceable
When you're just so incapable
Of getting past skin deep

Guess what, another game over
I got burned but you're the real loser
I don't know why
I've wasted my time with you

You're bad news, a history repeater
You can't trust a serial cheater
You're good at hooking up but you suck at love

You played me like an amateur
then stabbed me like a murderer
I'm left for dead, another one of your victims
It's not like you're unpredictable
But your act is so believable
I know it's nothing personal
It's just business as usual
You're good at what you do

Guess what, another game over
I got burned but you're the real loser
I don't know why
I've wasted my time with you

You're bad news, a history repeater
You can't trust a serial cheater
You're good at hooking up but you suck at love

Now I kinda feel bad for you
You're never gonna know
What it's like to have someone to turn to
Another day, another bed
It's just a game inside your head

Guess what, another game over
I got burned but you're the real loser
I don't know why
I've wasted my time with you

You're bad news, a history repeater
You can't trust a serial cheater
You're good at hooking up but you suck at love

Guess what, another game over
I got burned but you're the real loser
I don't know why
I've wasted my time with you
You're bad news, a history repeater
You can't trust a serial cheater
You're good at hooking up
(You're good at hooking up)
You messed this whole thing up
(You messed this whole thing up)
You were such an awesome fuck
But you suck at love
You suck at love
