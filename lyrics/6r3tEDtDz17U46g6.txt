And if you see me losing ground
Don't be afraid to lie
I know the pain inside my heart
Can't break the fear inside of yours

And if you see me losing faith
In what it means to die
Don't let me leave before I know
What lies behind the stained glass doors

Save sorrow for the souls in doubt
Bleed every care out

Will you carry me down
The aisle that final day?
With your tears and cold hands
Shaking from the weight

When you lower me down
Beneath that sky of gray
Let the rain fall down
And wash away your pain

For every word we never spoke
We have a tear to cry
For every silence like a wall
Between a better you and I

So if you see me losing sight
Of all the death in life
You'll find the peace in every time
I failed to see the death in mine

Let all the fear inside you drown
Tear out the blade and lay it down
Save sorrow for the souls in doubt
Bleed every care out

Will you carry me down
The aisle that final day?
With your tears and cold hands
Shaking from the weight

When you lower me down
Beneath that sky of gray
Let the rain fall down
And wash away your pain

Oh, the blood is rushing out
Oh, I'm better off without
Oh, the walls are closing in
Oh, sing for me again

Will you carry me down
The aisle that final day?
With your tears and cold hands
Shaking from the weight

When you lower me down
Beneath that sky of gray
Let the rain fall down
And wash away your pain

Will you carry me down
The aisle that final day?
With your tears and cold hands
Shaking from the weight

When you lower me down
Beneath that sky of gray
Let the rain fall down
And wash away your pain
