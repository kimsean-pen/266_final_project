Wish I could be the one
The one who could give you love
The kind of a love you really need
Wish I could say to you
That I'll always stay with you

But, baby, that's not me
You need someone
Willing to give their heart and soul to you
Promise you forever
Baby, that's something I can't do
Oh, I could say that I'll be all you need
But that would be a lie

I know I'd only hurt you

I know I'd only make you cry
I'm not the one you're needing
I love you
Goodbye
I hope someday you can

Find some way to understand
I'm only doing this for you
I don't really wanna go
But deep in my heart, I know
This is the kindest thing to do
You'll find someone
Who'll be the one that I could never be

Who'll give you something better
Than the love you'd find with me

Oh, I could say that I'll be all you need
But that would be a crime
I know I'd only hurt you

I know I'd only make you cry
I'm not the one you're needing
I love you
Goodbye
Leaving someone
When you love someone
It's the hardest thing to do

When you love someone as much as I love you
Oh, I don't wanna leave you
Baby, it tears me up inside
But I'll never be the one you're needing
I love you
Goodbye
Baby, it's never gonna work out
I love you
Goodbye
