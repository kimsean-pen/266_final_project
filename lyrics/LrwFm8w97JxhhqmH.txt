it's a very happy day
we are at lots of fun fun fun
and it's ice-cream and jelly
and a punch in the belly
how much can you throw over the walls?

and see how his face glows
it's a bike! what a surprise.
it's a big bike. what a big surprise.
it's a red bike. what a red surprise.
oh, what a surprise.

but the best thing there
but the best thing there
was the wonderful dog chair
was the beautiful dog chair
that could count right up to ten
it could count right up to ten
it went woof, woof, woof, woof, woof,
woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.

and it's another happy day
he was born eleven years ago
and this year it's long trousers
and a very smart tie.
just think in five years he'll be shaving.

and see how his face glows
it's an ninja sword. what a surprise!
it's a samurai sword. what a metal surprise.
he'll remember this day for the rest of his life.

but the best thing there
but the best thing there
is that sensuous dog chair
the immaculate dog chair
that could count right up to eleven

it could count right up to eleven
it went woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof,
woof, woof, woof.

but the best thing there
but the best thing there
was my darling the dog chair
but the rampaging dog chair
that could count right up to eleven
it could count right up to eleven.

and it went round and round the house.
