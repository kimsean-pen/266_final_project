Cannot hide
There's no zone
Slow decline
In your mind
You are not mine
I'm not yours
Why would I try
When you're not sure

I've been falling down
Upstate
Try to save me, it's too late
Voices in my head, talking
So I got the keys, I hop in

Like I'm just a reject
Putting back the pieces
Pushing you away like
I don't even need this
Laying on the freeway
Thinking 'bout what she said
Waiting for a semi truck
I don't even give a fuck
I just need a reason
I can't find a reason
Watching all the cars go
Passing like the seasons
Feeding all my demons
See you when I'm sleeping
I think I like her like the pain became my Jesus

Every damn day when the beat goes bang, oh
Every damn day that I feel like this, oh
Everyone know that I lost my way, oh
Every damn day like it make me sick, oh

There's nothing in me
Like asphalt or concrete
Memories, fifteen
Suffocating in my sheets
I can hear the sound racing
Laying down now, take me
Something in my head, hiding
I see the lights, shining

Like I'm just a reject
Putting back the pieces
Pushing you away like
I don't even need this
Laying on the freeway
Thinking 'bout what she said
Waiting for a semi truck
I don't even give a fuck
I just need a reason
I can't find a reason
Watching all the cars go
Passing like the seasons
Feeding all my demons
See you when I'm sleeping
I think I like her like the pain became my Jesus

Every damn day when the beat goes bang, oh
Every damn day that I feel like this, oh
Everyone know that I lost my way, oh
Every damn day like it make me sick, oh

Every damn day when the beat goes bang, oh
Every damn day that I feel like this, oh
Everyone know that I lost my way, oh
Every damn day like it make me sick, oh

Every damn day when the beat goes bang, oh
Every damn day that I feel like this, oh
Everyone know that I lost my way, oh
Every damn day like it make me sick, oh

Every damn day when the beat goes bang, oh
Every damn day that I feel like this, oh
Everyone know that I lost my way, oh
Every damn day like it make me sick, oh
