Separation
The result of your coming touch
What's motivation if my feelings can't turn into love
I spend my spare time
Frustrated and painting a mask
Fits right to your face
Recovers the thoughts of my past

It pains me to know that all I see
Is a vision to grow
And everything around me's always fading fast
It's what I'd like to see
So now I'll just open the window
Letting the wind blow

Separation
I fear that we're losing such
This conversation is dull and is nothing to love
Where's the passion
Diminished, it lays in the past
And I'm distracted
It's taken me this long to grasp

From far away
I can feel her preparing a place with my name
I awake
This dream's just a scene that I sculpted from pain
I built us a house with wedful desires
A fence that would mend
Protect you from crying

I can't erase
I can't erase
The faith that I corrupt my days through
The look on your face
I can't erase
My mind and heart working different ways
Separate
