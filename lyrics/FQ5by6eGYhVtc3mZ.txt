You really think
That your bigger than this
To the tune of ten thousand lisps
Who'd of thought i'd represent
When i can't take a compliment
Overexposure is the key
And any focus on me
Is appreciated
And it should be

No wonder now
I finally found
The right formula for

You taught me how
To play the fool
Every mistake that i make
I couldn't have made without you
What's said is done
It's plain to see
You take it all too seriously
Here's all you get from me

What better way
To make an honest mistake
Than a televised hand of fate
When the world closes in on you
A decision would be overdue
Now nothing is left out of hand
A stronger jaded man stands
And if the world is ending
We toast to it

I'm stronger now
But not with out
The right formula for

You taught me how
To play the fool
Every mistake that i make
I couldn't have made without you
What's said is done
It's plain to see
You take it all too seriously
Here's all you get from me
Her'es all you get from me

I'm down for whatever
What's there left to wait for

I'm down for whatever
What's there left to wait for
Wait for
I'll wait

You taught me how
To play the fool
Every mistake that i make
I couldn't have made without you
What's said is done
It's plain to see
You take it all too seriously
Here's all you get from me
