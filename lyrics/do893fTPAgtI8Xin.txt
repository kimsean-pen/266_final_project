I'm a loser
I'm a loser
I'm a loser, that's what they said, that's what they said
And now I got their women lyin' in my bed
Buy me a drink wishin' I was dead

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
I'm a loser and I don't know their names, don't know their names
Call me a superstar, play that game
Cost you a million just to sign your name

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
I'm a loser, that's right
Said go
That's right

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
I'm a loser, they're turn me around, turn me around
Big wide smile gonna bring me down
They don't know their ass from a hole in the ground

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
I'm a loser

Same people try to put me down
Trying to tread my band right into the ground
Son of a bitch, you can't steal my sound
