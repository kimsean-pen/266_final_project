This is where your sanity gives in and love begins
Never lose your grip, don't trip, don't fall, you'll lose it all
The sweetest way to die

It lies deep inside
You cannot hide
It's the meanest fire

Oh, it's a strange desire
You cannot lie
That's a needless fight

This is where your sanity gives in and love begins
Never lose your grip don't trip, don't fall, you'll lose it all
The sweetest way to die

When your blood runs dry
You're paralyzed
It will eat your mind

Did you hold it back
It comes to you in slow attacks
Oh, it's the meanest fire

This is where your sanity gives in and love begins
Never lose your grip, don't trip, don't fall, you'll lose it all

This is where your sanity gives in and love begins
Never lose your grip, don't trip, don't fall, you'll lose it all

This is where your sanity gives in and love begins
Never lose your grip, don't trip, don't fall, you'll lose it all
The sweetest way to die
