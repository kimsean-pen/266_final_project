When I get back up, I promise you
I could be great
When I get back up, I promise you
I won't be the same
So I hit that drum to my beat and
I get back onto my feet
When I get back up, I promise you, promise you
(When I get back up)

Hard times, it's a good fight
I got knocked down for the last time
Is there anybody else out there
Feeling like I'm feeling? Maybe life's not fair
Hard times and it's not right
I got knocked down, but I'm just fine
If there's anybody else out there
Feeling like I'm feeling, let it go

When I get back up, I promise you
I could be great
When I get back up, I promise you
I won't be the same
So I hit that drum to my beat and
I get back onto my feet
When I get back up, I promise you, promise you
(When I get back up)

Tough times, it's been a rough ride
I'm always down for the upside
Is there anybody else out there
Feeling like I'm feeling? Maybe life's not fair
Tough times, it's a good fight
I live my life with a black eye
If there's anybody else out there
Feeling like I'm feeling, let it go

When I get back up, I promise you
I could be great
When I get back up, I promise you
I won't be the same
So I hit that drum to my beat and
I get back onto my feet
When I get back up, I promise you, promise you
(When I get back up)

When I get back up, when I get back up
(When I get back up)
When I get back up, when I get back up

When I get back up, I promise you
I could be great
When I get back up, I promise you
I won't be the same
(When I get back up)
So I hit that drum to my beat and
I get back onto my feet
When I get back up, I promise you, promise you
(When I get back up)

When I get back up, when I get back up
(When I get back up)
When I get back up, when I get back up
(When I get back up)
When I get back up, when I get back up
(When I get back up)
(When I get back up, back up)
