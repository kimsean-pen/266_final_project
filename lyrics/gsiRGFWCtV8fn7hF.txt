You can cry a million tears
You can wait a million years
If you think that time will change your ways
Don't wait too long

When your morning turns to night
Who'll be loving you by candlelight
If you think that time will change your ways
Don't wait too long

Maybe I've got a lot to learn
Time can slip away
Sometimes you got to lose it all
Before you find your way

Take a chance and play your part
Make romance, it might break your heart
But if you think that time will change your ways
Don't wait too long

It may rain, it may shine
Love will age like fine red wine
But if you think that time will change your ways
Don't wait too long

Baby, you and I got a lot to learn
Don't waste another day
Maybe you got to lose it all
Before you find your way

Take a chance, play your part
Make romance, it might break your heart
But if you think that time will change your ways
Don't wait too long

Don't wait
Don't wait
