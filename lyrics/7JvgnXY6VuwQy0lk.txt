if you got the reason, the goal is to give you a rhyme
the vacuum of space is akin to perception of time

navigate the swirl of stormy weather
unfurling psychic charts of stars

I won't go!
slip to slide the entropy
before long
the building blocks will crumble

a crushing coercion can corrupt the mumbling mold
project the assertion to love only what you can own
only what you can hold

undulate beneath your lusty lover
click and whir of barren eyes

I will run
hearts, they hanker for mistake
with action
we catalyze disaster

indoctrined assassin berate with the force-feed fear
they tremble with trepidation
no shackle can jail the heart
that's near to me
in love is truth

i won't go
slip to slide the entropy
before long
we catalyze disaster

the queen of compassion
imprisoned by the fiend of greed
her benevolent beauty fogged-up
by the flash of the screen
blue glowing boxes besieged by the standard of being
