Julie, what's your problem?
Won't you tell me what's going on?
'Cause there's a dark cloud hanging over you
You've been down, down, down for too long

You used to sing sha, la, la, la, la, la, I want you
Sing sha, la, la, la, la, la, I do
There's a band outside
And they're playing now for you, for you

Julie, come to your window
Don't let your problems spoil the view
It's not a good day to cry today
So come on change, change, change
Come through the door

You used to sing sha, la, la, la, la, la, I want you
Sing sha, la, la, la, la, la, I do
There's a band outside
And they're playing now for you

You used to sing sha, la, la, la, la, la, I want you
Sing sha, la, la, la, la, la, I do
There's a band outside
And they're playing now for you, for you

Why, why, why do you cry, cry, cry?
You should know by now that the sun comes out for you
Why, why, why do you cry, cry, cry?
You should know by now that the sun comes out for you
that the sun comes out for you

You used to sing sha, la, la, la, la, la, I want you
Sing sha, la, la, la, la, la, I do
There's a band outside
And they're playing now for you, for you

You used to sing sha, la, la, la, la, la, I want you
Sing sha, la, la, la, la, la, I do
There's a band outside
And they're playing now for you, for you

Sha, la, la, la, la, la, I want you
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, I do
