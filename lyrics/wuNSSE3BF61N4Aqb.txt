I'm blue and lonesome
As a man can be
I'm blue and lonesome
Whoa-oh
As a man can be
I don't have headaches
Over myself
My love is gone away from me

Baby, ple-e-ease!
Come on back home to me
Baby, ple-e-ease, yeah
Come on back home to me
Yeah my, heart is full of misery
Baby, you won't be sweet to me

I'm gonna cast my trouble
Down in the deep blue sea
I'm gonna cast my trouble
Yeah, down in the deep blue sea
Let the whales and the fishes
Have a fuss over me.
