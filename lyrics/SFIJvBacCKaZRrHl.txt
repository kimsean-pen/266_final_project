So I've been told
A long, long time ago
A giant lived, now he sleeps
The legend goes that when
The creature shows
He'll bring a gift the world can keep

So we're gonna, so we're gonna
Take it 'til we're satisfied
So we're gonna, so we're gonna
Take it back

You know you wanna,
You know you wanna
You know you wanna join our side
If you want to live past tonight

Now, we're raging on like a locomotive
Shout, we're coming through
We're heading for ya
(We're coming, we're coming)
We are above all of the commotion
We are on track so get back behind us

Here we go
(We're coming, we're coming)
Yeah, here we go
(We're coming, we're coming)

The mortals played
While the beasts have been away
His power and might, a memory
Now here to stay
To make the mortals pay
He'll make it all, it used to be

So we're gonna, so we're gonna
Take it 'til we're satisfied
So we're gonna, so we're gonna
Take it back

You know you wanna,
You know you wanna
You know you wanna join our side
Are you gonna join the fight?

Now, we're raging on like a locomotive
Shout, we're coming through
We're heading for ya
(We're coming, we're coming)
We are above all of the commotion
We are on track so get back behind us

Here we go
(We're coming, we're coming)
Yeah, here we go
(We're coming, we're coming)

Here we go

Come and have a go
If you think you are hard enough
But I doubt you are

Now, we're raging on like a locomotive
Shout, we're coming through
We're heading for ya
(We're coming, we're coming)
We are above all of the commotion
We are on track so get back behind us

Here we go,
Come and have a go
If you think you are hard enough
(We're coming, we're coming)

Here we go,
Come and have a go
If you think you are hard enough

Yeah, here we go
(We're coming, we're coming)
Here we go
(We're coming, we're coming)
(We're coming, we're coming)
