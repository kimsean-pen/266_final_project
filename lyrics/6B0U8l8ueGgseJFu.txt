In a show of hands
Who has said these words before

And a show of hearts on the floor
Who has ever meant them more
Well I'll swallow my pride
If you'll stay for the years

And watch me spin circles as I disappear
And Hearts they don't lie they just quiver in fear
As you say (say)
Tonight we forget everything
And we stay the night
If I was wrong then I'm sorry
I'll stop this fight for the night

And this empty space left in the seat
To my right where you should be says a lot
Don't let it say goodbye

Don't let it say goodbye
Let it say goodbye
Forget everything
And we stay the night
If I was wrong then I'm sorry
I'll stop this fight for the night

And this empty space left in the seat
To my right where you should be says a lot
That today I know
That tomorrow will shine again
golden and bring
Our hearts back home
And today I know
That tomorrow will shine again
golden and bring
Our hearts back home
And today I know
That tomorrow will shine again
golden and bring
Our hearts back home
And today I know
That tomorrow will shine again
golden and bring
Our hearts back home
(And today meant nothing
