Watching a fire
Skipping under thunder
Crossing a wire
Connecting undercover

Be mine
It's a physical thing
I wanna give you
All the love I can give
The love I can give

Cause you make me surrender
With you I'm forced to surrender

Burying rivers
Drowning all our fears
Burning the bridges
Pushing all the gears

Be mine
It's a phsical thing
I wanna give you
All the love I can give

Cause you make me surrender
With you I'm forced to surrender
I'm letting go waving the white flag
I've given up the fight
Given up the fight
Cause you make me surrender

Losing a battle
Head into the shallow
Let go of the haandle
Let us be alone now

Chorus

You make me surrender
With you I'm forced to surrender
