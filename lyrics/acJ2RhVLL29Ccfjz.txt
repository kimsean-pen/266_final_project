That real, that deep, that burning, and amazing, unconditional, inseperable love
That feel like forever, that always emotional and still exceptional love
Can't nobody tell me nothin', said it is what it is
Any mistake you make I-I just might forgive

Right now, right now, in this very moment, I still love him like I loved him then
I love him in and out and up and down and 'round and 'round and over and over again
So rare, they swear that you just don't exist

There's only one person I can think of that makes me feel like this
I'm a fool, such a fool for you
That deep, that sweet, that soft and that wet, that fire, that funky stuff
That up and that down, that front, that back
Baby, I can't seem to get enough
Ooh, baby, let me do it, let me do it 'til I'm satisfied
Oh baby, now, right now, baby, I ain't got no more pride
Sweet sugar, I surrender
I don't want no other man. Baby, you win
And you ain't never got to worry, ever got to worry, you'll never be alone again
There's nothing, there's nothing, ooh that I wouldn't do

I wrote a song about it, daddy
Everybody know who I'm talking to
And I'm a fool, such a fool for you, yeah

I'm a fool, such a fool for you
