Guinnevere had green eyes
Like yours, m'lady, like yours
She'd walk down
Through the garden
In the morning after it rained

Peacocks wandered aimlessly
Underneath an orange tree
Why can't she see me?

Guinnevere drew pentagrams
Like yours, m'lady, like yours
Late at night
When she thought
That no one was watching at all
On the wall

She shall be free

As she turns her gaze
Down the slope
To the harbor where I lay
Anchored for a day

Guinnevere had golden hair
Like yours, m'lady, like yours
Streaming out
When we'd ride
Through the warm wind down by the bay
Yesterday

Seagulls circle endlessly
I sing in silent harmony
We shall be free
