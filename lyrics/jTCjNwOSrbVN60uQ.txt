Power doesn't care what you want
Power just wants to watch
And power doesn't care what you need
As long as you're on your knees

Power pigs
Power pigs
Power kills
Power wills

Power pigs
Power pigs
Power kills
Power wills

Power doesn't care what you think
Power just wants a little piece
And power doesn't care how you feel
As long as you learn how to kneel
