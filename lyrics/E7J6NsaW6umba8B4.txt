You are every part of me
And with every breath I take
Your love will light my way
And for every day I live
The promise that I made
Is I will never let you go babe

I swear I never knew love like this before
And for everything you are
I gotta make you know
For your love

I'd give anything for your love (For your love, yeah)
'Cause baby I'd never make it alone (No)
And forever I'll stand by your side
I just gotta make you see yeah
I only live... for your love

When I was running out of faith
You still believed in me
And never let me fall
And the times I lost my way
You're the one who held me up
And brought me through it all

I swear I never saw it like this before
'Cause baby with your love you gave me
The reason to go on
And for your love

I'd give anything for your love (For your love, yeah)
'Cause baby I'd never make it alone (Don't you know)
And forever I'll stand by your side
I just gotta make you see yeah
I only live... for your love

And everything I am
And all that I could be
Would mean nothing now
If you're not with me
Shinin' your light on me
When night is closin' in
When I was weak
You were the one who made me strong
You gave me faith to carry on (ohh)

And I'd give anything for your love (I'd give anything now)
'Cause baby I'd never make it alone (I'll never make it alone)
And forever I'll stand by your side
I just gotta make you see yeah
I wanna live for your love
Wanna sing for your love
Wanna give your your love

I'd give anything for your love
'Cause baby I'd never make it alone (Oh yeah yeah)
And forever I'll stand by your side...
