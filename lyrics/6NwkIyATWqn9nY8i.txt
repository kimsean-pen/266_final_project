Confused, not anymore
I mean at one point I thought I was wrong
But you see he lied, he cheated,
he betrayed me, then he left
But I won't hurt anymore
Cause now all my pain is gone
So long.

So long to all my pain
Goodnight to my heartache
Goodbye sorrow
I wont cry no more
I'm leaving ...(i'm leaving)

If you would only treat me right
I'd stay here by your side
But I am down to my last cry
So I'm leaving you goodbye
You turned away from opportunities
To sit and talk things through
But now when I'm saying I'm leaving you
You have so much to prove

So long to all my pain
Goodnight to my heartache
Goodbye sorrow
I wont cry no more
I'm leaving tomorrow

Stop writing me sweet letters and
Calling me on the phone
We argued constantly when I saw you
Always left me in the cold
I made the choice to finally go
Cause I cant stand this pain
Its time for my last tear to fall
And me to smile again

So long to all my pain
Goodnight to my heartache
Goodbye sorrow
I wont cry no more
I'm leaving tomorrow

Sorrows and heartache goodbye
I'm leaving you
Don't wanna meet again
Has got to be the end
The end

The sun will finally shine on me
And clouds will drift away
There's something that's in store for me
That's my brighter day

So long to all my pain
Goodnight to my heartache
Goodbye sorrow
I wont cry no more
I'm leaving tomorrow

So long to all my pain
Goodnight to my heartache
Goodbye sorrow

Now I just cant wait
Tomorrow's too late
I'm leaving you today
