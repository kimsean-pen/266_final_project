Stay
And I will turn these unforgiving words into a star
Stay
This scenery would change if we could watch it from afar
Pain
Like icons of our suffering, distilled, the works of art
Pain
A sting of life to bind us to these heavens, torn apart

Celestial violence
In all of us
I fall across the sky
Celestial violence
Feel the unrelenting pulse inside

Sing
And celebrate the chaos of this canvas that is night
Sing
But strike a chord of dissonance when harmony betrays to lure you blind into the light
An emptiness so deep
Even time will disappear
Hand in hand with all the whispers of the intermission
The still anticipation of a scream

Celestial violence
In all of us
I fall across the sky
Celestial violence
Feel the unrelenting pulse inside
Celestial violence
I will turn these unforgiving words into a star
Celestial violence
This scenery would change if we could watch it from afar
Celestial violence
The still anticipation of a scream
Celestial violence
Celestial violence
Celestial violence
Celestial violence
Celestial violence
