"Put your hands up you're surrounded"
They're circling me
'Cause I'm a hustler baby
Come on, I bring it on, can't turn it off

Another day I'm gone again without you
Gotta get it while it's good
I know I'm robbin' the hood
Come on, baby come on

Gonna put it over there
White flag in the air
Gonna get my way when I cease the fire
I wanna be with you
I'm droppin' everything

I'm gonna take it easy
No not gonna do a thing
Gonna take it easy
I'm gonna take it easy
No not gonna do a thing
'Cause I know you miss me

Gonna do it, got to get it perfect
And I'm running out of time
Baby please cut in line
Come on, come get me baby, take me home

So tell me, what's so great about perfect?
I'm perfectly wound
I'm gonna throw in the towel
Come on

I'm gonna take it easy
No not gonna do a thing
Gonna take it easy (with you)
I'm gonna take it easy
No not gonna do a thing
'Cause I know you miss me (I miss you)

Got to get a change of scenery
Got to get a taste of greenery
I'm gonna hit and run
A yummy yum yum
Going underground, I'm gonna hide out with out law
Watch out, you might get what you're after
The less I say about it the better
Got to take it easy

I'm gonna take it easy
No not gonna do a thing
Gonna take it easy (with you)
I'm gonna take it easy
No not gonna do a thing
'Cause I know you miss me (I miss you)

Gonna put it over there
White flag in the air
Gonna get my way when I cease the fire
I wanna be with you
I'm droppin' everything

I wanna be there
I wanna be there
I wanna be there
I wanna be there
