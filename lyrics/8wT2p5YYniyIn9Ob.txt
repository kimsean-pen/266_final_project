Throwing poison seeds into the wind
Make the poison tree growing in me begin
Let your branches dwarf my name
Let your honey harden me
Blood loving, whisper poisoning
Oh, beautiful poison tree, let your flower grow in me
Let your sorrow grow in me
Take away my blood and home
Take your flowers deep inside of me
Place us in comforting
In my insides' a tiny poison tree
Eyes beautiful like my dreams
Tiny Beautiful Poison Tree
Oh beautiful Poison Tree, let your power grow in me
Let your sorrows sow in me
Turn me into a poison tree
Make my shadow go away
Make my branches strong and hard
Make my leaves flower and spread
Make me feel like something powerful is growing deep inside of me
Turn me into a poison tree
