Well she wore you like silk
Bandaged all around
The scars of your love
Became your hollow crown

And she held you through the night
And kissed you through the cold
Blinded by your light
Just waiting to grow

She said love, I give you everything
I give you everything that you need
Love, well I'd do anything
I'd do anything to be seen

So when you packed all of your bags
And left without a word
Well the voices in her head
Were begging to be heard
So she wept all through the night
And slept all through the day
Cos her lonely, lonely heart is caught in every trap you laid

And she said love, I gave you everything
I gave you everything that you need
Love, well I'd do anything
I'd do anything to be seen

So why did we break down
Why did we break down
Was it just cos we weren't ready
Why did we break down
Why did we break down
Was I vulnerable, too unsteady?

Why did we break down
Why did we break down
Was it just cos we weren't ready
Why did we break down
Why did we break down
Was I too vulnerable, too unsteady?

Well, love, I gave you everything
I gave you everything that you need
Love, I'd do anything
I'd do anything to be seen
Love, I'd do anything
Anything to be free, to be free, to be free
