So I'll think of you now when the rain falls
How we burned all those pictures, erased from our memory
You still quoted those lines like a bible made for you
Ironically painful, oh God how I miss you

Now I subsequently lost my mind, love
Apparently I'm going nowhere
I subsequently lost my mind, love
They tell me that I'm going nowhere
'Cause I've got nothing, the clouds have come
I could just melt away, no one would know I'm gone
I subsequently lost my mind, love
Apparently I'm going nowhere

I miss you most, my friend, my love
I miss you most, my friend, my love

You would lace up my shoes, I would polish your boots
It's the strangest of things I hold on to like diamonds
I don't know you now, I don't know who you are
You said I was the sunshine behind your destructions

Now I subsequently lost my mind, love
Apparently I'm going nowhere
I subsequently lost my mind, love
They tell me that I'm going nowhere
'Cause I've got nothing, the clouds have come
I could just melt away, no one would know I'm gone
I subsequently lost my mind, love
Apparently I'm going nowhere
I subsequently lost my mind, love
They tell me that I'm going nowhere

Subsequently subsequently

I miss you most, my friend, my love
Nothing will ever be enough
I miss you most, my friend, my love
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I miss you most, my friend, my love
Nothing will ever be enough
I miss you most, my friend, my love
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

I subsequently lost my mind, love
Apparently I'm going nowhere
I subsequently lost my mind, love
They tell me that I'm going nowhere
