I missed you not giving everything to high
But going out alone
I won't turn my back, I won't look to the side
In the shadows
How's it feeling inside? Keeps on pulling to provide
But won't I survive?
I won't turn my back, I won't look to the side
I won't crawl through the shadows
Bring me down

Cut me loose
I still can't quite
Get over you
I'm crawling home

Bring me to
I wish to
Come back to you
Whole body stoned
Dive into
I always do
Crawl back to you
How can't you see that I won't just run up high?

Girl, let's watch the light
I won't come back this time, keep an open mind
Don't just watch me fly
Bring me down
Cut me loose
I still can't quite
Get over you
I'm crawling home

Bring me to
I wish to
Come back to you
Whole body stoned
Dive into
I always do
Crawl back to you
I'm crawling home

Bring me to
I wish to
Come back to you
Whole body stoned
Dive into
I always do
Crawl back to you
Body stoned

Bring me to
I wish to
Come back to you
Crawling home
Bring me to
I always do
Come back to you
