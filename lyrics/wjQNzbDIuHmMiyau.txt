Foreseen, Half man, Machine I am
Eating from an empty hand
Awaken me, I am a fraction of infinity
As flames arise, I boil, I shake
A destiny of how it's made
It tears in me I need to let it be

As tears are falling from my eyes
I see a world that's upside down
See me bleed I'm one the run
Uoh

Mechanical Illusion
Search through every open door
To end this war
Reset the evolution
Drives us to accept no more
Become what we were before

Repent repeat, The history
I'm half the man I used to be
I walked the line
Enhanced with powers never to be seen
I falter in a darkened dream
A winding path that's haunting me
It's black or white
It's my Eternal life

As tears are falling from my eyes
I see a world that's upside down
See me bleed I'm one the run
