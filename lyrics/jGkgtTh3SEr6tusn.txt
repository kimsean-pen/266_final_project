I'm bored by love
Some ideas of
Wild thing runs free
What could it mean to me?

This is all I've got, it's all I've got
This is all I've got, it's all I've got

Do a watercolor
Of the cat on the front porch
How do you keep talking
When your language is dying?

This is all I've got, it's all I've got
This is all I've got, it's all I've got
