Paint death with colour night
Scream loud your feeling fright
Hear the mercy yell fight
Unchain the beast inside and bite
Face the underworld
This twisted and naked world
Where screams sing the song
The song of the netherworld
We are the fears
We are always near
We are the fears that feed our souls
With frozen tears
We are the fears
We sound clear
We are the fears that nail your soul
With our spears

Weep for me, for you, for thee
Pray in your distress to die
Lay down, obey, vile
Face the enemy and fight
Welcome to our world
To gloomy and dusky world
Where sins sing our song
The song of the netherworld
We are the fears
We are always near
We are the fears that feed our souls
With frozen tears
We are the fears
We sound clear
We are the fears that nail your soul
With our spears

CHORUS
Dark covered era, behold eternal
Beware the quite torment that last eternal
Bloodstained era that last eternal
Fire... Fire...

Dark covered era
Bloodstained era
That last eternal
Fire... Fire...
