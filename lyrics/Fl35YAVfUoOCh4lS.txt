What about them scares you so much?
My standing there threatens your standing too
No longer yearn to be gentle and pure and sweet
Not intimidating yet sure

"If I lived the way you did, I wouldn't be here today"
"You only get to say these words because
We enabled it."

"You only get to speak this way because
We once stood for it."

You will raise your voice and talk aloud but once you didn't have a voice at all
"If you think you' re the only one in this self-made world of yours..."

So long, my old friend

You were only a casualty in my cleaning house again
You were only a casualty in my cleaning up again
