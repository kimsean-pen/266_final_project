When the sun rises silver
If it rises at all
Meet me there across the water
And we'll start an endless storm

Rain falls in love
Rain falls in love

Together we walk the English winter
So caught up in one another
Because if we're under thunder showers
The rain is ours and we are lovers
Heavy Weather

Come on lightning try to strike us
We might be frightened but we won't run
We'd be so happy if we were fearless
And in the darkness we will become

Rain falls in love
We fall in love

Together we walk the English winter
So caught up in one another
Because if we're under thunder showers
The rain is ours and we are lovers
Heavy Weather

Heavy Weather, Heavy Weather, Heavy Weather
Heavy Weather, Heavy Weather, Heavy Weather, Heavy Weather
Heavy Weather

Together we walk the English winter
So caught up in one another
Because if we're under thunder showers
The rain is ours and we are lovers
Together we walk the English winter
So caught up in one another
Because if we're under thunder showers
The rain is ours and we are lovers of
Heavy Weather
Heavy Weather
Heavy Weather
Heavy Weather
