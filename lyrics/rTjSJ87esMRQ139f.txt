Maybe take just one more look around
When you need a friend
To go on the ground
You must fend for yourself
Till you win, win the race
Then you laugh in their face
Swear me in, I'll testify
I'll be the apple of your eye

When you count the million eyes on you
And they're waiting just for what you do
Don't believe all that you read
Caught the news
Like some bad fitting shoes
Hurts when you laugh
As you're singing in the back

You can't pretend that your fortune won't end
You can't believe that you got all you need by your side
When it comes down to your own peace of mind
Lose everything including your pride
And still survive

Maybe take just one more look around
When you need a friend
To go on the ground
You must fend for yourself
Till you win, win the race
Then you can laugh in their face
I'll testify
I'll be the apple of your eye
