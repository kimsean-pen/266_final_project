Take a look at these dirty hands
Take a look at this face, these blazing eyes
Do you see me as a broken man? Oh yeah
Tell me are you really that blind?

You got yourself a load of trouble now
You got yourself a bad deal
You say I've got a bad attitude
Well, how do you think I feel?

You got me locked in a paper cage
You think I'm chained up but I'm just tied down
Step aside, get it out of my way
I won't hurt you, I had enough being pushed around, oh yeah

You got yourself a load of trouble now
You got yourself a bad deal
You say I've got a bad attitude
How do you think I feel?

Don't want a number, I got a name
Take a look at my face
You talk about a bad attitude
Things have got to change, oh yeah

You got yourself a load of trouble now
You got yourself a bad deal
You say I've got a bad attitude
Well, how do you think I feel?

Don't want a number, I got a name
Take a look at my face
You talk about a bad attitude
Things have got to change
