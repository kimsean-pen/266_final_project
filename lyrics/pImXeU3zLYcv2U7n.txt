just
simply
paraphrase
all that you're feeling
into tiny bit sized bits
squeeze them tight so they might fit
over
melodies
these little phrases
come along it's not that hard
you'd be fine if you'd just start

come on get on with it
it's not that easy you must admit
when the words you choose never fit
make do with merely adequate

now you've tried
but they won't wall out your mind

i'm
tired
of all you excuses
force yourself it's worth the fight
it's not as though your hands are tied
option paralysis stole you time
if you don't decide you'll fall behind

come on get on with it
it's not that easy you must admit
when the words you choose never fit
make do with merely adequate

now you've tried
but they won't fall out your mind
do you realise this is bigger than you

words likely have less merit
than the timbre of their sound
so sing anything you feel like
and don't let it get you down
