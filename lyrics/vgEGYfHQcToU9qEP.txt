Telegraph, coast to coast
And it's not
I'm coming in, I'm coming in
I'm coming in
And if I listen to this song
It's out on the wait,
Breaking and says
Bringing me back into your show
To your show

Now I'm walking away
And somebody's talking
If I ever see you again
I'm going to have to give you something
Then I'll see if
somebody's talking
Don't understand, I'll wake up with somebody

I've got a mind like a mirror that makes no mistake
I got a little bit seeing your face again
Don't make me reason, don't pretend
We'll meet in so I'll look and begin again
On your show

On a physical state
Because somebody's talking
If I ever see you again
I'm going to have to give you something
Then I'll see if
somebody's talking
Don't understand, I'll wake up with somebody
Then I'll see if
somebody's talking
Don't understand, I'll wake up with somebody

Somebody's talking
Somebody's talking

Now I'm walking away
And somebody's talking
If I ever see you again
I'm going to have to give you something
Then I'll see if
somebody's talking
Don't understand, I'll wake up with somebody
Then I'll see if
somebody's talking
Don't understand, I'll wake up with somebody
