It's a long, cold walk after midnight
When you send me home
'Cause she comes 'round late, and she hates it
When we're left alone
She's beautiful, and I just can't compete

But I'd ride with you, die with you
I'd spend my life with you
Stuck with me, fuck with me
So come make love to me
I know she's sweet, but she isn't me
Where she lies in your eyes
That's where I wanna be

When a stranger says
We look good together, we just laugh
If you only knew how it hurts
'Cause you're my other half
This nightmare has become
My favorite dream (favorite dream)
'Cause I'm standing in
For a love that is the real thing
You know I need you

'Cause I'd ride with you, die with you
I'd spend my life with you
Stuck with me, fuck with me
So come make love to me
I know she's sweet, but she isn't me
Where she lies in your eyes
That's where I wanna be
That's where I wanna be

On the side of the bed where she sleeps
Driving home with your hand on my knee
Not the one that you want, but the only one you need
That's where I wanna be

Ride with you, die with you
I'd spend my life with you
Stuck with me, fuck with me
So come make love to me
I know she's sweet, but she isn't me
Where she lies in your eyes
That's where I wanna be

Ride with you, die with you
I'd spend my life with you
Stuck with me, fuck with me
So come make love to me
I know she's sweet, but she isn't me
Where she lies in your eyes
That's where I wanna be
That's where I wanna be
That's where I wanna be
That's where I wanna be
That's where I wanna be
