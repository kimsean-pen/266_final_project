Put it in the back of my mind
I don't usually say this but you know i might
Maybe i was wasting my time
Holding shit together so you know i try

I'm moving so slow know i thought i'd feel better
Only been a month but it's taking forever
I don't really know we've had a feel better
You don't really know me so you wouldn't mind

Oooh you thought you knew me like that but you don't
In the middle of the summer here I am, we're still...
I don't think you know me like you thought you did back then
Back then you knew me but right now you just don't

Oooh you thought you knew me like that but you don't
In the middle of the summer here I am, we're still...
I don't think you know me like you thought you did back then
Back then you knew me but right now you just don't
You just don't

People change and is gonna feeling stressed out
I kind of strange that this nothing we can talk about
So what do you say maybe reason's why we lucked
You don't really know this like I thought you did

Oooh you thought you knew me like that but you don't
In the middle of the summer here I am, we're still...
I don't think you know me like you thought you did back then
Back then you knew me but right now you just don't

Oooh you thought you knew me like that but you don't
In the middle of the summer here I am, we're still...
I don't think you know me like you thought you did back then
Back then you knew me but right now you just don't
You just don't

My lover I'm so sad
How am I gonna do?
You know when you feel silence?
I just feel silence now
So sad

You don't know me like like I wish you would or you did last summer
Truth is I'm alone, I'm not happy it's not hard to understand
Put it in the back of my mind
You were missed so much
We been out of touch lately
Maybe I was wasting my time guessing not now and you not like maybe
