Here we go, 1 2 3 4

There's nothing left to hide
You can see it in my eyes
Oh I've tried to be who I thought you wanted

And if it's all a lie
The truth's not far behind
We could try to live right for the moment

Ramona

If only I had known,
It's less than what I felt
Why should I have nothing to fear from?
