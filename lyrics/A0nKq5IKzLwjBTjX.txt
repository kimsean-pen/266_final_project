I'm a good friend and an excellent lover
I can fool myself just like no other person can
I'm turning into a twisted man

I haven't got any time for selfless deeds
What I do for you is indirectly for me
I'm a stubborn boy, there's nothing here that you can break or destroy
Then as I count sheep in my bed
A train of worry pulls us through my head

Last night I dreamt I died alone
Through all my talk of self-defeat
A fearful bomb ticks underneath
Last night I dreamt I died
From now I'll curb the cynical speaking
It seems that dream has sent the biggest chill through me

Someone once said I don't have any feelings
Well I think that emotions can be misleading
And thinking back
I might have nailed the coffin shut with that

As I tend to cry in a room full of laughter
Is the cheese finally sliding off of it's cracker?
I don't know I'll just prepare myself to let it go

As I count sheep in my bed
A train of worry pull through my head

Last night I dreamt I died alone
Through all my talk of self-defeat
A fearful bomb ticks underneath
Last night I dreamt I dieed
From now I'll curb the cynical speaking
It seems that dream has sent the biggest chill through me
It seems that dream has sent the biggest chill through me
It seems that dream has sent the biggest chill through me

Last night I dreamt I died alone
And apart from when I lost my virginity I've never been know to frighten easily
