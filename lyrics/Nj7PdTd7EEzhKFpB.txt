Im so young and you're so old
This my darling I've been told
I dont care just what they say
'Cause forever I will pray
You and I will be as free
As the birds up in the trees
Oh, please, stay by me Diana

Thrills I get when you hold me close
Oh my darlin' you're the most
I love you but do you love me
Oh Diana can't you see
I love you with all my heart
And I hope we'll never part
Oh, please, stay with me Diana

Oh my darlin', Oh my lover
Tell me that there is no other
I love you with all my heart
Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh
Only you can take my heart
Only you can tear it apart
When you hold me in your loving arms
I can feel you giving all your charms
Hold me darlin', hold me tight
Squeeze me baby with all your might
Oh, please, stay by me Diana
Oh, please, Diana
Oh, please, Diana
