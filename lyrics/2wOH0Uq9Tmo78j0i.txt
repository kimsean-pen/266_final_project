Once there was a place I called home
Everything was peaceful there
I remember my childhood
I remember my youth

My head was full of dreams
And I felt so blue
So innocent and pure at heart

Everything has changed...

I am not the man I used to be
And this is not the world I want to live in
This is not my home
Tell me what happened here?

I am not the man I want to be
I can only see my shattered dreams
Tell me why, everything fades to grey

Now winter has come
And everything lies under ice
All my memories are buried under the snow

All the things I have seen
And all the thing that I have done
Made me what I am now
