Observe my obsession with someone new
Don't feel like someone new
The connection is real with someone new

In this tomb I call love
I get so lonesome with you
Or without you, sweetheart
The hellhound's here

Hallucinate my love
Nothing's real in the morn
When I rise, I'll leave you to die
You to die, you to die
