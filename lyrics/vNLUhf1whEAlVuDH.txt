We walk those streets together, oh-oh
It really was my pleasure, oh-oh
Your beauty is so fine
Really turns my mind
And steals my breath away

I'm crazy, and you know it, oh-oh
Although I really show it, oh-oh
Your beauty is so fine
Really blows my mind
And steals my heart away

That's how strong our love is
That's how strong this love is
I don't care what they're saying
That's how strong...

Forever and you know it, oh-oh
And through this life we're rolling, oh-oh
Your beauty is divine
Really blows my mind
It steals my heart away

When sorrows, they consume you, oh-oh
This world has left you so blue, oh-oh
Just take me by the hand
I hope you understand
There is another way

That's how strong this love is
That's how strong this love is
I don't care what they're saying
I'm with you, that's what I'm saying

That's how strong this love is
That's how strong this love is
That's how strong this love is
That's how strong...

Whoa, if we shall move on together
We, we move on together, together, together
Whoa, you feel your sunshine
Breathe the air for last time
We move on, yeah, together
