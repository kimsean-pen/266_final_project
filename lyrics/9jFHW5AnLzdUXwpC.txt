Baby, I'm coming home
Make the fire warm
Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms
Nothing to my name
But my own flesh and bones
A suitcase full of stars
A suitcase full of stars

I've been digging up every constellation
Travelling galaxies without a station
Faithful to my made up mission
I forgot about us
And no I don't need another reincarnation
Losing my mind searching for explanation
Faithful to my made up mission
I never felt like enough

I forgot about us
I forgot about us
I forgot about us

Everything has changed
But everything's the same
I've gained and I've lost
I've gained and I've lost

I've been digging up every constellation
Travelling galaxies without a station
Faithful to my made up mission
I never felt like enough

I forgot about us
I forgot about us
I forgot about us
And no I don't need another reincarnation
Losing my mind searching for explanation
Faithful to my made up mission
I never felt like enough
I was never enough
And no I don't need another reincarnation
Losing my mind searching for explanation
Faithful to my made up mission
I forgot about us
