Time can break my life
Said today will be the day I'll take away
The big old rut out of your heart
Someday I'll walk you in the park

Time can be so cruel
But gave me memories with you
So I guess it's cool, do what you gotta do
Even though it's hard, some day I'll walk you in the park

Run, run when everything's slow
Whenever grass is green I'll be thinking about you
I'm in love wherever flowers grow
As long as water's wet
Everything's a flower

Time, time can be so cruel
But gave me memories with you, dude
I guess it's cool
Do what you gotta do
Do what you gotta

Even though it's hard
Even though it's hard
Some day I'll walk you in the park

Run, run when everything's slow
Whenever grass is green I'll be thinking about you
I'm in love wherever flowers grow
As long as water's wet
Everything's a flower
Run, run when everything's slow
Whenever grass is green I'll be thinking about you
I'm in love wherever flowers grow
As long as water's wet
Everything's a flower

Watch me play guitar
