We unite in a burst of the fight
We're the skyriders, stormbringers
In the light of the burning sky

Moon sets over Eden in dark light colors fade
At the gates of seven kingdoms all the roads lead to pain
In sacremony I'm the benedict of war
Walk the footsteps of the giants
An illusionist of fear

There's a legend told of a ghost in the sky
Hide among the clouds
Is it just a dream or is it for real

It's a curse heaven sent in a dark sacrament
We're the skyriders, stormbringers
By the hand of the king into battle we fly
We unite in a burst of the fight
We're the skyriders, stormbringers
By the hand of the king in the light of the burning sky

Blood red torn horizon pass through my looking glass
I'm an empty vessel waiting for the storm to arise
My sweet surrender to the dark side of my soul
Any last words to the hangman
On your memory I swear

There's a legend told of a ghost in the sky
Hide among the clouds
Is it just a dream or is it for real

It's a curse heaven sent in a dark sacrament
We're the skyriders, stormbringers
By the hand of the king into battle we fly
We unite in a burst of the fight
We're the skyriders, stormbringers
By the hand of the king in the light of the burning sky

It's a curse heaven sent in a dark sacrament
We're the skyriders, stormbringers
By the hand of the king into battle we fly
It's a curse heaven sent in a dark sacrament
We're the skyriders, stormbringers
By the hand of the king into battle we fly
We unite in a burst of the fight
We're the skyriders, stormbringers
By the hand of the king in the light of the sky
In the light of the burning sky
