I'm on the chopping block
Chopping off my stopping thought
Self doubt and selfism
Were the cheapest things I ever bought

When you said it's love d'you mean the back of love?
When you said it's love d'you mean the back of love?
We're taken advantage of breaking the back of love
We're taken advantage of breaking the back of love

Easier said than done you said
But it's more difficult to say
With eyes bigger than our bellies
We want to but we can't look away

What were you thinking of when you dreamt that up?
What were you thinking of when you dreamt that up?
Taken advantage of breaking the back of love

When you're surrounded by
A simple chain of events
Eventually
You'll shack those shackles off

We can't tell our left from right
But we know we love extremes
Getting to grips with the ups and downs
Because there's nothing in between

When you say that's love d'you mean the back of love?
When you said that's love d'you mean the back of love?
Taken advantage of breaking the back of love

What were you thinking of when you dreamt that up?
We're taken advantage of
We're breaking the back of love
Breaking the back of love
