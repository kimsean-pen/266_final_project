Trendy Wendys you know what I mean
Hangin' around with girl who's rolling up her jeans
She watches her street cred 'cause she's no dummy
Saw rockin the microphone and now she's calling me a honey
Says I know what I want, don't move with thugs
Warehouse parties, hip-hop, and smoking drugs
And whoever's been the boss she's down with 'em
She's always on time 'cause the girl got rhythm
To avoid all complications, I'll give some information
About a certain location under Paddington Station
'Cause when I host my show I avoid the girl called Lola
Who's more p-p-popular than the drink they call Coca Cola
I'm just practice posing face is shaded in black
Is dominating as my color, the massive attack
Right now I hit it, kick it, flow smooth hit middle wicket

I take a small step, now it's a giant stride
People say I'm loud, why should I hide?
Only had a small taste, so what a waste
I quietly observe though it's not my space
Bottom end's heavy, you know we're never even
People call me Tricky for particular reason
I've got you, say, and I've got to let you know, see
We're rockin' in your area, rock beneath your balcony
My baby just cares for me, well that's funny
Her touch tickles, especially on my tummy

Now who's got the microphone?

Now who's honey?

A turbo turbo and chant with a charge
Addy Daddy G wild bunch crew at large
Don't call me an officer just call me a sarge
Mashing up the country planning also abroad
Plan to go to America when I get a visa card

But gettin' a visa card nowadays isn't hard

So keep your ears glued listen to every chord
Tokyo City's one place that we toured
Four Technic plus two mixer board
Sharper than a Wilkinson razor sword

When I was a child I played Subbuteo on
My table then I graduate to Studio One
'Cos D's my nom de plume you know but 3's my pseudonym
And around my neck you know I wear the Sony Budokan
Indigo blues you got me in my own shoes
The people dancing in the shape, for what they make they can't lose
Yes waxing lyrical but this time it's not satirical
It's kinda spherical, so jam me in a cir-i-cle
This is the miracle of the dubplate dub selection

So whether you're black or white or half-caste in your complexion

Yes pull out your phono plug and tuck you in you phony
It started by Marconi, resumed by Sony
A summary of wireless history and only
Massive Attack enormé esplosioné

Get away with you gangsters
We don't want it
Get away with you gangsters
We don't like it
Eternal love eternal love
Money money money
Root of all evil
Money money money
Root of all evil
