I see it you in you glance
That you want him
How can I make peace
With this truth?
The truth is this man
He brings out all the lust
and guilt deep within
I'll stand in Hell and say
no same witness in this
town needed proof

Send me to Hell
Or to the gallows
She belongs to the Devil
What could I do?

De you know what it is to lose?
To be the other man
Who stood go chance
To wake in the yarning to black defeat
Waiting in the wings

Send me to Hell
Or to the gallows

I will have his life for this
and I know that I will pay
With the blood of all my young life
but Gabriel what can't you see?
What am I to do?

Cuir gohlfreaing mé
no cuir chun crochta mé
Is leis an Diabhal I,
Cad a Jhéadfaing a dthéanand

I was never one for salvation
Now clid I seek you redemption
So I'll do what i have to do
to see out the day
Blood in streams mixed with rain
Damn you love and damn your lies
and now I'll hang by my father's hand
In the square where your first glance
left my heart in despair
