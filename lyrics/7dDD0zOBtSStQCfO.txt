It doesn't make us strong
It doesn't make us weak
Tongue tied dis-serviced like shy pre-teens
I could only breathe
Live to believe
I'm alone

It didn't come easy, I'm glad it was hard
Worth the wait to give you my heart

Big tease, small kiss
I turn to wax and melt like this

I found you in pieces, you'd been torn apart
A million one reasons to end before you start
But deep down I knew
No matter what in the end, it'd be me and you

Big tease, small kiss
I turn to wax and melt like this
Melt like this

Lavender haze
Djarum Vanilla, Turkish Jade
You and me
We have it made

Caress my knees with your tongue
Teeth on my waist I come undone
It's those hours in the night just before light
Run your hand down my spine
We kiss the dust goodnight
Goodnight

Big tease, small kiss
I turn to wax and melt like this

Lavender haze
Djarum Vanilla, Turkish Jade
You and me
We have it made
