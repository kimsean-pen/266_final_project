Extra clever.
Earthbound spirit.
Ghost in the form, of a mongoose.
And I have hands.
And I have feet.
I'll never die, I am a freak.
Hello, I'm here, I'm living in the wall, I know I might be small, but I am a...
Freak.

Thou wilt never, know what I am.
I am the fifth dimension, and I'll split the atom.
And if you see me, you're paralyzed.
Pillar of salt, you're mummified.
Hello, I'm here, I'm living in the wall. I know, I might be small, but I am the eighth wonder.

And I was born, 1852.
And I was born, in India.
And I shall haunt, like the Buggane.
With such weird noise, and clanking chains.
Hello, I'm here, I'm living in the wall. I know I might be small, but I am a...
Freak.

I stay banished to underground.
Jim, let me go. I watch like Hell.
And I have hands, and I have feet.
I'll never die, I am a freak.
Hello, I'm here, I'm living in the wall. I know I might be small, but I am the eighth wonder.

Eighth wonder of the world.
You'll never get to see.
What in the name of God can I be?
