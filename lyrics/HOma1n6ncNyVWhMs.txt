I guess you never knew, dear boy
What you had found
I guess you never knew, dear boy
That she was just the cutest thing around
I guess you never knew
What you had found, dear boy

I guess you never saw, dear boy
That love was there
And maybe when you look too hard, dear boy
You never do become aware
I guess you never did
Become aware, dear boy

When I stepped in
My heart was down and out
But her love came through
And brought me 'round
Got me up and about

Dear boy
Dear boy, dear boy
Dear boy

When I stepped in
My heart was down and out
But her love came through
And brought me 'round
Got me up and about

I hope you never know, dear boy
How much you missed
And even when you fall in love, dear boy
It won't be half as good as this
I hope you never know how much you missed
Dear boy, how much you missed, dear boy
