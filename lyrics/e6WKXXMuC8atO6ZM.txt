ivory ceilings
burgundy walls
theres blood i can feel it
as we float through the hall
and when you bite my skin
the whole room gets dim
vampire banquet
vampire banquet
vampire banquet
and we're never gonna make it

and we're never gonna make it
and we're never gonna make it
we're locked in a room
we're locked in a room
we're locked in a room
we're locked in a room
we're locked in a room
we're locked in a room
we're locked in a room
we're locked in a room
theres no getting out
theres no getting out
theres no getting out
theres no getting out
we're stuck in this house
we're stuck in this house
we're stuck in this house
we're stuck in this house
this house
vampire banquet
vampire banquet
vampire banquet
and we're never gonna make it
and we're never gonna make it
and we're never gonna make it
we're locked in a room
we're locked in a room
we're locked in a room
we're locked in a room
we're locked in a room
we're locked in a room
and there's no getting out
