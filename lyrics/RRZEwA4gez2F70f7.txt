How timeless is love
Love surrounding a being
All too fateful heart
Evades one from seeing
The number of ways
In a number of ways
To change the pace of the days
Into living breathing
Living breathing

Silence is golden
Yet hiding is dying

Can one find a truth in a star
While peering into the night
No matter how far
Is the flickering light
And one is not what is seen
In all the numbers in every way
How timeless is love
Living breathing
Living breathing

There is a tree (far away)
Living in me
Rooted and high
Kissing the sky
And in the tree (the night is alive)
A night bird sings
Forever song
