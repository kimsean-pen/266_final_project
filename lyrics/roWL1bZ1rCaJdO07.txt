You threw me away
Just like all the others
It's been seven days
And not a single word
You threw me away
(After you it's all the same, all the same)
Just like all the others
(After you it's all the same, all the same)
It's been seven days
(After you it's all the same, all the same)
And not a single word
(After you it's all the same, all the same)
Make everything happen exactly like I know
Just like the ones before, just like the ones before
I hope you know what you are doing to yourself, to yourself
I hope you know what you are doing
After you it's all the same, all the same
After you it's all the same, all the same
After you it's all the same, all the same
After you it's all the same, all the same
I'll take comfort, you'll take security
I'll take comfort, you'll take security
You threw me away just like all the others
It's been seven days and not a single word
Who chooses to keep all these bohemian thoughts alive
It's just the same, the same as yesterday
Don't wake me up if you have nothing to say
Who chooses to keep all these bohemian thoughts alive
Make everything happen just exactly like I know
Just like the ones before, just like the ones before
I hope you know what you are doing to yourself, to yourself
I hope you know what you are doing
What are you but a yellow, purple zebra?
Contacts so I can see clearer
Write these words in stone I'm a magnet
I cause tension and retract it
Please ask me again cause I didn't hear it
Get settled in cause you can't be here yet
All partied out on stranger's favors
How you act like we're friends
But we're only neighbors
Excuse me, pardon the eruption
I walk up press all the buttons
I'll talk down, stress all the functions
I always gotta be starting something
So power to the people
Cause the fight for rights is equal
Power to the people
Cause the fight for rights is equal
After you it's all the same, all the same
After you it's all the same, all the same
After you it's all the same, all the same
After you it's all the same, all the same
After you it's all the same, all the same
After you it's all the same, all the same
You threw me away just like all the others
It's been seven days and not a single word
Who chooses to keep all these bohemian thoughts alive
It's just the same, the same as yesterday
Don't wake me up if you have nothing to say
Who chooses to keep all these bohemian thoughts alive
Content with who we are
Driving in our cars
Through thin lanes on long roads
So much to behold
Greatest country?
Where you been to form that opinion
See it, believe it
Celebrity leadership
