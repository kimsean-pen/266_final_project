like mass text, it gets passed around
what do you call that?
my body cashed out
you say it's on me, no it's not on me
you should've had that
you should've called me

believe it when i say...
there's snipers to the west side
i saw you like a model...
but actually a real one
that was in seattle...
i'd end myself to know you...
i keep pressing on though
the point is yr a charmer...
i talk to you in past tense
is that what you want
yeah

back to the way that you put me in pain
when you say it's not enough
come here baby
in the last two years it was everything i gave you...

i want yr legs wrapped around me tightly and now
my girl is cool like the baddest around
and i will wait wait wait by my phone for you now
calling late
call in passionate sound...

i said i was right though i saw you act elusive in sin
feel me once by yr legs and within
i wait for you to say
i need you more than once
and yr calling me back
it's a question of enough
i say it's adding up...
me is who i love.
