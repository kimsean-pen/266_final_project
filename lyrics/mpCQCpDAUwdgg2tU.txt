Never just get by rule the world by chance
Came so far shout at minutes on hands
And we never, never trust no one
Take it all and leave, us leave us without no one

Visions, they fall apart
Hopelessly lost switch of hearts
When lights back on
Fail forever
Visions
Fall apart and we are all lost
Hopelessly lost when lights back on
He fail forever

Law of the land

Tell your story before old age kills your plans
We all speed it up never losing a dance
Will we ever ever know where to stop
Feel a kiss when lips touch or never get enough

Visions, they fall apart
Hopelessly lost switch of hearts
When lights back on
Fail forever
Visions
Fall apart and we are all lost
Hopelessly lost when lights back on
We fail forever

Lately I have been
Screaming from lungs that a tongue won't follow
Lately I have been (x2)

Visions they fall apart

Visions they fall apart
