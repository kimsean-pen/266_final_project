Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

And if you feel you're sinking,
I will jump right over into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I want you to know

I won't let go (I won't let go)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go (I won't let go)
I'll be your lifeline tonight

Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and that's how we grow
Yeah yeah yeah
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old
I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own

And if you feel you're sinking,
I will jump right over into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into such different places
I still be so patient with you girl
And I hope you know

I won't let go (I won't let go, I won't let go)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go (I won't let go)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
