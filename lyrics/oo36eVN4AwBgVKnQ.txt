Somebody switch the oxygen off and take their games away
Somebody take the plug from the wall
and let them find their own way through
I know it's you, it's the evil you do

Somebody take their platform away and let them stand alone
Somebody cut the fog with a knife down to the knuckle bone
It's true, they lie to you, it's the evil they do

I can't breathe but I CAN SEE THROUGH YOU

Somebody let them know that they're wrong and they're all misinformed
Somebody light the torch of truth
to see the shit they've spawned on you
It's not all true, it's the evil they do

Somebody hold them all to account and un-corrupt our minds
Somebody raise their voice from the din and let the past rewind
It's true, it's in front of you, it's the evil they do

I can't breathe but I CAN SEE THROUGH YOU

In the house where they long to be,
they throw stones through the glass
In the end they wish to be free but they're chained to the past
They're wasting their time away
Left them out in the cold
They've got nothing much left to say
They'll lie down as they're told

I SEE THROUGH YOU (It's the evil you do)
