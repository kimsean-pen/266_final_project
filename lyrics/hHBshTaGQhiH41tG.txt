All American
Evil game of extortion
A sick old man and who would guess
He was once S.S.
A deadly fascination

Of a madman's solution
Six million dead
Poison tales pollute his head

Tell me a story

Will ya? Will ya?
A real good story
I won't leave til ya
Spill your guts, old man
Leave out any secrets, hiding in the...
Any skeletons, and all your other sins
Any skeletons, in the closet
Any skeletons
Any misfortunes
Any skeletons, hiding in the closet!
Any skeletons

Any skeletons in the closet!
It's insanity

Puppet master, boy or Nazi
Apt pupil, he hears the screams
Nightmare turns into wet dreams
Hatred lives, boiling inside
Dealing death it's bumicide
In too deep
Their secret stands but it won't keep
Tell me a story
Will ya? Will ya?
A real good story
I won't leave til ya
Spill your guts, old man
Leave out any secrets
Hiding in the...
Any skeletons, and all your other sins
Any skeletons, in the closet
Any skeletons
Any misfortunes
Any skeletons, hiding in the closet!
Any skeletons
Any skeletons in the closet!
LEAD BREAK
FUN PICKIN' PART
The truth comes out
Conspiracy there is no doubt
His life is ruined, but no not yet
He's still got one card in the deck
A loaded gun, a happy smile
He'll scope the freeway for awhile
King of the world, four hundred rounds
It took five hours to bring him down
Tell me a story
Will ya? Will ya?
A real good story
I won't leave til ya
Spill your guts old man
Leave out any secrets
Hiding in the...
Any skeletons, and all your other sins
Any skeletons, in the closet
Any skeletons
Any misfortunes
Any skeletons, hiding in the closet!
Any skeletons
Any skeletons... yow, yow, yow!
Look out!
Any skeletons... yow, yow, yow!
