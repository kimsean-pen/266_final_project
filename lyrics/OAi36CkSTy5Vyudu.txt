I know most times I'm far away
But still, I'm missing you (But still, I'm missing you)
I've said some things that I regret
But I'll make it up to you
Baby, I can't breathe when you touch my body
When your heart beats it's like music to me
And I can't see my life without you
And baby, it's all up to you

If I could make time stand still
Then I know we'd live this moment forever
Can we stay right here?
You don't have to go baby close that door
I really hate missing you
I rather be kissing you
Don't know what I would do
If I couldn't make love to you
Over and over and over and I wish that I

Could live this moment in time

As of today I put my life completely in your arms
And if you should feel I could do more to please you
Then baby tell me how, oh, oh
Baby, I can't breathe when you touch my body
When your heart beats it's like music to me

And I can't see my life without you
Baby, it's all up to you

If I could make time stand still
Then I know we'd live this moment forever
Can we stay right here?
You don't have to go baby close that door
I really hate missing you
I rather be kissing you
Don't know what I would do

If I couldn't make love to you
Over and over and over and I wish that I
Could live this moment in time

If I could make time stand still
Then I know we'd live this moment forever
Can we stay right here?
You don't have to go baby close that door
I really hate missing you
I rather be kissing you
Don't know what I would do
If I couldn't make love to you
Over and over and over and I wish that I
Could live this moment in time
