She stepped off the bus out into the city streets
Just a small town girl with her whole life
Packed in a suitcase by her feet
But somehow the lights didn't shine as bright as they did
On her mama's TV screen and the work seemed harder
The days seemed longer
Than she ever thought they'd be

But you know you got to stick to your guns
When it all comes down
'Cause sometimes you can't choose
It's like heads they win
Tail you're gonna lose

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, livin' out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rollin' the dice of her life

Now she found herself in the fast lane
Livin' day to day
Turned her back on her best friends, yeah
And watched her family slip away
Just like a lost soul
Caught up in the Hollywood scene
All the parties and limousines

Such a good actress
Hiding all her pain
Trading in memories for fortune and fame
Just a step away from the edge of the fall
Caught between heaven and hell
Where's the girl I knew a year ago

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, livin' out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rollin' the dice of her life

Too much too soon
Or just a little too late
'Cause when her ship came in
She wasn't there and it just wouldn't wait

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, livin' out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rollin' the dice of her life

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, livin' out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rollin' the dice of her life
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, livin' out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rollin' the dice of her life
