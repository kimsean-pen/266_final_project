You got your H. P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allan Poe
You got your unkind of ravens
And your murder of crows
Catty eyelashes
And your Dracula cape
Been flashing triple A passes

At the cemetery gates
Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby
(You're so dark)
(You're so dark)

(You're so dark)
(You're so dark)
And you're so mysterious
Got that obsession with death
I saw you driving your Prius
And even that was Munster Koach-esque
You watch Italian horror

And you listen to the scores
Leather-clad and spike collar
I want you down on all fours

Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby
I know you're nothing like mine
Cause she's walking on sunshine
And your love would tear us apart

And I know I'm not your type

Cause I don't shun the daylight
But baby, I'm willing to start
(You're so dark)
Got your H. P. Lovecraft

(Lovecraft)
Your Edgar Allan Poe
(Poe)
Got your unkind of ravens
(Ravens)
Got your murder of crows
You're so dark,
(You're so dark)
babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark,
(You're so dark)
baby
But I want you hard
You're so dark,
(You're so dark)
oh
But I want you hard
You're so dark,
(You're so dark)
baby
