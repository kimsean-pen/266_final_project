Time flies something beautiful is dead
Your words are still ringing in my head
Chasing shadows that were lost into the night
Think back to when the world was set alight

We're not gonna make it, if we just forsake it
What is there to loose
Now my mind is spinning, this is just a beginning
Love is what I choose

The ruins of Rome
Take the last plane home
The ruins of Rome

Flaming fires, lost years that are to come
Dark days, of knowing that we did wrong
Wake up there's a whole world left to see
One chance to rewrite history
