Somewhat desolate
The story ending
We were a nation wide
Suddenly alone again
Like long ago
Maybe they be gone
No life to found
Any time soon
A family blooming
In the moment
And tomorrow's Sunday
Just one for the moment we're together
With the fire burning higher into nowhere
Wait a minute now
Your life is pending
Why does it seem so hard
Wanna be the best you can
Like long ago
Faintly
Almost gone
No life to be found
Any time soon
A family blooming
In the moment
And tomorrow's Sunday
This one's for the moment we're together
Spite the fire burning higher into nowhere
