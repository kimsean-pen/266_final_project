It's a hard living, tail kicking
Trip that we're all on, but I'm betting
We can find a little sunshine in the night
It's a back breaking, soul taking
Road we walk, so what are we waiting for?
Baby let's turn off the lights
'Cause girl, there's just not enough love in the world

So we should make a little
Generate a little
Maybe even make the world a better place a little
We could turtle dove, Dixie land delight
You know it can't be wrong when it feels so right
It all comes down to you and me girl
There's just not enough love in the world
So we should make a little
Then make a little more tonight

It's a clock punching, cash crunching
And it all adds up to nothing
If you're in this thing long
So don't tease me, it's so easy
To just turn off the TV, and make some headlines of our own
Yeah, and girl there's just not enough love in the world

So we should make a little
Conjugate a little
Maybe even make the world a better place a little
We could turtle dove, Dixie land delight
You know it can't be wrong when it feels so right
It all comes down to you and me girl
There's just not enough love in the world
So we should make a little
Then make a little more tonight
That's right

Yeah, and girl there's just not enough love in the world

So we should make a little
Consummate a little
Maybe even make the world a better place a little
We could turtle dove, Dixie land delight
You know it can't be wrong when it feels so right
It all comes down to you and me girl
There's just not enough love in the world
So we should make a little
Then make a little more
We should make a little
Then make a little more
We should make a little
Then make a little more tonight

Talk about loving all night, yeah
