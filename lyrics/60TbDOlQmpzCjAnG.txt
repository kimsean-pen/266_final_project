This ain't nothing but a summer jam
Brown skin and singing and dance (ohhoho)
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can
Hey-yeah ooh hey-yeah
Summer jam alright
Hey-yeah ooh hey yeah

Tonight heart is wearing prouder skirts
Real tight temperature is rising
Feelin' real hot in the heat of the night
Midnight the party was stopped
into the moonlight
I'm scoping out the honeys with the
light eyes
Be with me tonight

Can't get you out of my mind
I can't lie
Cause a girl like you is so hard to find
I'm waiting for the day to make you mine
Cause I can't take it

This ain't nothing but a summer jam

Brown skin and singing and dance (ohhoho)
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can
Hey-yeah ooh hey-yeah
Summer jam alright
Hey-yeah ooh hey yeah

Moonlight cruisin' down the boulevard
Store light watching your body's tight
Alright looking kinda freaky to me

Can't get you out of my mind
I can't lie
Cause a girl like you is so hard to find
I'm waiting for the day to make you mine
Cause I can't take it

This ain't nothing but a summer jam
Brown skin and singing and dance (ohhoho)
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can
Hey-yeah ooh hey-yeah
Summer jam alright
Hey-yeah ooh hey yeah

This ain't nothing but a summer jam
Brown skin and singing and dance (ohhoho)
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can

This ain't nothing but a summer jam
Brown skin and singing and dance (ohhoho)
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can
Hey-yeah ooh hey-yeah
Summer jam alright
Hey-yeah ooh hey yeah
Summer jam alright
