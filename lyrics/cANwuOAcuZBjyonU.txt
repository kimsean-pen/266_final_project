(Verse 1:)
Well I've been havin' a bad time,
Since I was twenty-two.
I never had a chance in life,
Used to get trodden on in school.
Well now things are different,
Ain't it funny how things can change,
I've been havin' a good time,
Since I've become derranged.
(Gonna give you a)

(Chorus:)
Bad time honey,
Treat you any way I choose.
Bad time honey,
To make up for those days at school.

(Verse 2:)
Well I've been having a bad time,
Since you found out how to be cruel.
I never had a chance at all,
Since I've been hangin' round with you.
But now things are different,
Ain't it funny how thing it can change,
I've been having a good time,
Since I've become derranged.
(Gonna give you a)

(Chorus:)
Bad time honey,
Treat you any way I choose.
Bad time honey,
To make up for those days at school.

(Solo)

(Chorus: x2)
Bad time honey,
Treat you any way I choose.
Bad time honey,
To make up for those days at school.
