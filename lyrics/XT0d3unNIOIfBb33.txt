You're the habit I've been waiting for
You're the one I can't ignore
Can you tell me what it means, it means?
You're the habit I can't live without
You're something I cry about
But I like the way it feels

Now you're under my skin, under my skin, you're under my skin
And I'm letting you in, letting you in, keep letting you in

You're the habit I've been waiting for
You're the one I can't ignore
I need you, I want you, I need you, I want you
You're the habit I can't live without
You're something I cry about
I want you, I need you, I want you, I need you

I keep coming back
You're my habit

You're the rush that keeps me up at night
You're the high I cannot fight
And you can tell me I'm insane, I'm insane
You're the habit that I can't give up
You're the one I'm thinking of
And I can't walk away

Now you're under my skin, under my skin, you're under my skin
And I'm letting you in, letting you in, keep letting you in

You're the habit I've been waiting for
You're the one I can't ignore
I need you, I want you, I need you, I want you
You're the habit I can't live without
You're something I cry about
I want you, I need you, I want you, I need you

I keep coming back
You're my habit

And I keep coming back for more
And I keep coming back for more
I keep coming back
And I keep coming back for more
And I keep coming back for more
I want you, I need you, I want you, I need you

I keep coming back
You're my habit
