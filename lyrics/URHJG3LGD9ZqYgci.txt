Dance!
Back door cracked, we don't need a key
We get it for free
No V.I.P. sleaze

Drink that Kool-Aid
Follow my lead
Now you're one of us
You're comin' with me!

It's time to kill the lights and shut the DJ down
This place about to
Tonight we're takin' over, no one's getting out

This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to...

Now what?
We're taking control
We get what we want
We do what you don't

Dirt and glitter cover the floor
We're pretty and sick
We're young and we're bored

It's time to lose your mind and let the crazy out
This place's about to
Tonight we're taking names 'cause we don't mess around

This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to blow...

Go, go, go, go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them hands
Let me, let me see them hands
Go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them hands
Let me, let me see them hands
We are taking over
Get used to it
