I'm standing til I hit the floor
My legs start losing all control
Let's do this mother, mother yeah
Do this mother, mother, let's go
Break me down, but i don't fall
There's madness in this burning soul
Let's do this mother, mother yeah
Do this mother, mother, let's go

It's killing me, killing me
But the pop-ups are thrilling me
Adrenaline junkie burning, is keeping me hungry
It's a swift left hook, but I'm taking a punch or two
So, I can take a few from you

And we all get down, and we all get high
Cuz everybody, everybody
All just wanna feel it all
Feel something
Cuz everybody, everybody
All just wanna feel it all (feel it all)
Everybody, everybody
All just wanna feel it all (feel it all)
Everybody, everybody
All just wanna feel

I ain't need no sweaty hands
I'm the one to make demands
Let's do this mother, mother yeah
Do this mother, mother, let's go (let's go)
I'm lightning, when the rain falls
I'm thunder, when the challenge comes
Let's do this mother, mother yeah
Do this mother, mother, let's go

It's killing me, killing me
But the pop-ups are thrilling me
Adrenaline junkie burning, is keeping me hungry
It's a swift left hook, but I'm taking a punch or two
So, I can take a few from you

And we all get down, and we all get high
Cuz everybody, everybody
All just wanna feel it all
Feel somehing
Cuz everybody, everybody
All just wanna feel it all (feel it all)
Everybody, everybody
All just wanna feel it all (feel it all)
Everybody, everybody
All just wanna feel
