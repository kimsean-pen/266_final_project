I could bet all of the riches that I ever had,
Rushin' the night like a shockwave wouldn't be bad.
If I had to second heart, cause of the thrills that run up my back,
You're my star' nothing else can lead me off track.

Hey, yeah.
You're like a wildfire, you've got me rising high.
Your innocence, who's brave?
Drowning in, would you save me?
It's a crime if you don't,
You'll despair by the throat. (?)
