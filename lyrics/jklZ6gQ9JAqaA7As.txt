You left, the coffee's burning
You thought that I was sleeping, when you told me you loved me
You'll slip a note in my jeans, and let me know what you mean in pen
Farewell, I'm leaving soon...

All I wanna do is
Nothing with you
In your apartment, on vacation forever
In your apartment

I'll take the subway downtown
We'll slip away, fool around
Let me swim in your thoughts again
We'll write a song no one hears
Bite our lips, fight the tears
So long, farewell, we're leaving
Yeah we're leaving soon...
(We need this but...)

All I wanna do is
Nothing with you
In your apartment, on vacation forever
In your apartment, on vacation forever

Flip your hair
I feel you everywhere
Unaware of just what you do
I'm so scared and loaded with blues, but balanced by you
Flip your hair, I feel you but
I'm so scared and loaded with blues, but balanced by you

All I wanna do
Is a whole lot of nothing with you
In your apartment, on vacation forever
In your apartment, on vacation forever
In your apartment
In your apartment, on vacation forever
