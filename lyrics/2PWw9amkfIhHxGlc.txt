Arise with the new dawn's hour
Breathe in the air so blue
Nightmares of yesterday's sorrows
Disappear into the light anew

Here today, gone tomorrow, it will be
Leave your ghosts behind
For a while

Night came with warm tears
Now the drops of morning dew

Arise with the new dawn's hour
And let your eyes reflect the dark

Away with the first light of the day
Let it wash your tears away today
And all that will remain

Nothing here will stay the same
Nothing here will stay the same
Nothing here will stay the same

Not even this pain

Here today, gone tomorrow
It will pass with time, and leave its mark on you
Embrace this early hour

Silent trees and still horizon
You will find it here
When the wind lifts your broken wings

Arise with the new dawn's hour
And let your eyes reflect the dark

Away with the first light of the day
Let it wash your tears away today
And all that will remain

Nothing here will stay the same
Nothing here will stay the same
