When I was younger, oh, much younger than today
Never needed anybody's help in any way
But now those days are changed, I'm not so self-secure
Now I find I've changed my mind and I've opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you coming 'round
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
Won't you please help me?

And now those days have changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
And every now and then I feel so insecure
Feel like I need you like I never did before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you coming 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please help me?

Here we go
Oh

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you coming 'round
Help me get my feet back on

Oh
