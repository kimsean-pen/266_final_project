I would wait for you
By the light of the moon
You couldn't see me
But I could see you

You were never alone
You were all on your own
I saw it back then
Stickle and all

I'm watching you
Keep on watching you

I would know one now
But one day I could rise
Warmth to your heart
And love in your eyes

I could leave you alone
You know when it's too long
I saw it back then
Stickle and all

I'm watching you
Keep on watching you
Keep on watching you
Keep on watching you
Keep on watching you
