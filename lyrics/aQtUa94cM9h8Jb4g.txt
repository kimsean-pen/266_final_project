Know you ride it right,
Might just die tonight,
But you know i'm still coming through baby.
I know its bad for me,
And you know it tastes so sweet,
I think i need your abuse baby.

Girl you do damage to me,
You know i love it, Yeah i love ya
Aint nothing better for me now.
Girl you do damage to me,
You know I love it, yeah i love ya
Aint nothing better for me now,
than your poison baby.

Angel of the night,
Drown between your thighs,
I'm still here, ain't no excuse baby.
I see you in my sleep.
I'm scarred beyond belief.
Ain't nothing you can't make me do, baby.

Girl you do damage to me,
You know i love it, Yeah i love ya
Aint nothing better for me now.
Girl you do damage to me,
You know I love it, yeah i love ya
Aint nothing better for me now,
than your poison baby.

Girl you know I play my role when i'm inside that,
With my hand around your throat I know you like that.
Girl I'll do anything,
to hear you scream my name, I love your game, I do. I do.

Girl you do damage to me...
You know i love it...
You're poisonous baby
