Falling down can be a rough start
Go to bed, go to bed
Wake up smart, wake up smart
Some time on
And I'm happy now
Listen how
I'm happy now.

Nights spent out, a one way tide
The days crumbled to dust
I lost again but I know I tried
Adjust, adjust, adjust
Retrust, retrust, retrust
I'm a little bit bored by how little I know
I felt reassured for a while at the show
But I don't wanna be polite to bigoted guys
So I'm gonna stop smiling
When it doesn't feel like the right thing

Falling down can be a rough start
Go to bed, go to bed, wake up smart, wake up smart
Some time on, and I'm older now
I listened to the ones that know how
And I'm older now

Nights spent out, a one way tide
The days crumbled to dust
I lost again but I know I tried
Adjust, adjust, adjust
Retrust, retrust, retrust
I'm a little bit bored by how little I know
I felt reassured for a while at the show
But I don't wanna be polite to bigoted guys
So I'm gonna stop smiling
When it doesn't feel like the right thing

I wasted summers then
So I've been here before
I've been here before
A waster round the bend
Leaves you wanting more
Leaves you wanting more
