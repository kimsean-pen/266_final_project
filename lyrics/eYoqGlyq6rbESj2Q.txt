black lung got you down tonight
saving it all for work
suha pins her arms to her side
watching her twin want to die

i hate my body, i hate the desert
please let me escape
when will i be going home
i hate my husband, i hate my children
i'm going to hang myself
when will i be going home

black hair got you down tonight
black love black cuts from your work
weep like the busted girl you are
wash down your hope in that car

my name is suha, i'm 25 years old
i'm going to hump a cop
when will i be going home
