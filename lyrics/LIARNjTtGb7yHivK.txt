I said girl why you keep callin'
I said girl why you keep callin' (yeah)
She said I need new whip (yeah)
'Cause I know you still ballin'
She just wanna go back to the future
So I bought that girl a DeLorean
Twenty one minutes until I gotta go
So I told that girl that I'm gonna slaughter it

I met that girl right up at my show
Left her man in the crowd on the floor
Out of town never saw her before
Tell her, baby we don't got that long
Listen, this is not my city show, but I treat it like my city show
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on (Yeah)
I am not small, these girls just want me 'cause I got the dough
Pass that girl right on my friend give her coke
He pass me her friend so they switching roles

I hit it fast, yeah I hit it slow bye bye
The morning girl I gotta go
I gotta get ready tonight is my show
If you okay you might open my show
Got pointers right under my nose
These niggas mad, cause I got all the dough
These niggas mad, cause I got all the dough
Changing my style cause I got every flow
Got every girl ain't no topping my hoes
I understand that is your girlfriend bro
But you know I gotta keep her close
Open your legs and I keep em closed
Living on a edge, on a tightrope
I am so clean I might start moving soap
Driving a new 'Rari I don't need a new
Drive a Bugatti like it's a Volvo
I got your girl and you already know
Don't really like her we friends for the most
Cuban the truck all on my choker
Don't leave the crumb
Got the bread then you toast
If you start touchin' my gun, got no holst'
I put a coat on top of my coat
Only 20 more minutes
Before the show

I met that girl right up at my show
Left her man in the crowd on the floor
Out of town never saw her before
Tell her, baby we don't got that long
Listen, this is not my city show, but I treat it like my city show
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on (Yeah)
I am not small, these girls just want me 'cause I got the dough
Pass that girl right on my friend give her coke
He pass me her friend so they switching roles

Damn I just started it, man I just started it
Oh my god bitch do not bother me
Don't got enough just to order me
I'm on that tree like an ornament
Money so long like a cardigan
You lied to me wasn't sorry then
On the weekend you was partying
It was just me you was targeting
It was just me you was targeting
Just in the Porsche I might target it
Jump in the Lamb I ain't parkin' it (skrr)
Go to my show they applaud me in
She call my phone with that emergency
She call my phone with that urgency

I said girl why you keep callin'
I said girl why you keep callin' (yeah)
