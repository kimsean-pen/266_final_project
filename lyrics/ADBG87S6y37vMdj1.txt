If your man only knew how you're feeling
I'd see right through you, oh oh
If your man only knew that you still love me
I'd known you love me

I see you're still be wearing that necklace I'd gave you
With that hidden note, saying "forever yours"
I love you, fell in love in the summer
A kiss in the water, 2004, and never let you go

If your man only knew how you're feeling
I'd see right through you, oh oh
If your man only knew that you still love me
I'd known you love me, oh yeah yeah

There is no endless summer, we knew all along
Wonder when it came, you had to go away but
I was your first and that never goes away
First cut the deepest, babe

If your man only knew how you're feeling
I'd see right through you, oh oh
If your man only knew that you still love me
I'd known you love me, oh oh

I saw you on the street today
With that guy you pretend to [?]
Fake smiles and I wish you well
Picked up my car then walked away again
And that never goes away
First cut the deepest, babe
I always feel the same, feel the same

I see you're still be wearing that necklace I'd gave you
I know what it's saying
If your man only knew how you're feeling
I'd see right through you, oh oh
If your man only knew that you still love me
I'd known you love me, oh yeah
You still love me, I know you love me
