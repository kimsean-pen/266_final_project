Driving in my beat up car
Too broke to go very far
Some days I just wanna feel ya
Other days I wanna kill ya
Higher than no other love
Safer than no other drug
If you wanna tell me something
Call me, call me, call me, call me
It all takes time
You don't take time
Everything takes time
It takes time to learn
Yeah, yeah yeah
Call me up again
Yeah, yeah yeah
Call me up again
Thinking on the things I lost
Wrote it down but I still forgot
All the shit I swore I'd remember
Everyone's getting back together
And I wish I could but I just left town
I'll hit you up when I'm back around
You bring me higher than no other love
Safer than no other drug
If you wanna tell me something
Call me, call me, call me, call me
It all takes time
You don't take time
Everything takes time
It takes time to learn
Well, hello my lonely roller coaster
I'm comin' up so please scoot over
Call my sister, call my mom
Call my girlfriend, call the cops
Shut off the world I can't let go
All the shit I think I know
When I am right but I am wrong
You have loved me all along
When I am right but I am wrong
You have loved me all along
Driving in my beat up car
Too broke to go very far
Some days I just wanna feel ya
Other days I wanna kill ya
Higher than no other love
Safer than no other drug
If you wanna tell me something
Call me, call me, call me, call me
