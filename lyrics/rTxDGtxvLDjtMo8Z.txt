If it's all the same to you
Could I fall asleep next to you?
I've been waiting to hear you breathe
Cause without it, I can't sleep

With your hands all through my hair
You're holding onto all the air
And judging from how we've been
You should kiss me like you mean it again
Cause I don't wanna be your friend

Call me "Pretty Young Thing"
Make me weak until I'm speechless
Falling into you
Hear my mad machine gun heartbeat
Pounding right beside you
Giving me away
Giving me away

Did you know that when you laugh
It tears my heart in half?
When I feel you look my way
I keep feeling you all day

God gave to me with just one hand
But He gave to you with all He had
And when our feet are intertwined
I feel your blood in my feeble veins
Oh, how I want you to stay...

Call me "Pretty Young Thing"
Make me weak until I'm speechless
Falling into you
Hear my mad machine gun heartbeat
Pounding right beside you
Giving me away
Giving me away

What was I supposed to do?
Laying right there next to you
What am I supposed to do with you?
...with you?

Call me "Pretty Young Thing"
Make me weak until I'm speechless
Falling into...
Falling in, falling in, falling into you

Hear my mad machine gun heartbeat
Pounding right beside you
Giving me away
Giving me away
