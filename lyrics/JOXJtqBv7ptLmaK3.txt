Take a breath, hold it in, start a fight, you won't, win.
Had enough, let's begin, never mind, I don't care.
All in all, you're no good, you don't cry, like you should.
Let it go, if you could, when love dies, in the end.

So, I'll find, what lies beneath, your sick, twisted smile.
As I lie underneath, your cold jaded eyes.
Now you turn, the tide on me, 'cause you're so unkind.
I will always be here, for the rest of my life!

Here we go, does it hurt, say goodbye, to this world.
I will not, be undone, come to life, it gets worse.
All in all, you're no good, you don't cry, like you should.
I'll be gone, when you fall, your sad life, says it all.

So, I'll find, what lies beneath, your sick, twisted smile.
As I lie underneath, your cold jaded eyes.
Now you turn, the tide on me, 'cause you're so unkind.
I will always be here, for the rest of my life!

Don't, carry me under, you're the devil in disguise.
God, sing for the hopeless, I'm the one, you left behind.

So, I'll find, what lies beneath, your sick, twisted smile.
As I lie underneath, your cold jaded eyes.
Now you turn, the tide on me, 'cause you're so unkind.
I will always be here, for the rest of my life!
