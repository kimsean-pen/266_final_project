I'm creeping and lurking
You niggas deserve it and murder's my purpose (yeah, yeah)
If you hang with the set, bet you niggas go first and it's sacred they worship (yeah, yeah)
I've been through the darkest
I've battled the hell
I've been through the torment (yeah, yeah)
Them niggas ain't worth shit (yeah, yeah)
So I'm bringing the torture
I trap through the portals
My flow is immortal
I come through and rip his body in half like he got a Divortia
You wrecking my force, yeah
We gonna crash on your course
Finish the mission abort
Fuck nigga that's a course
Killin' niggas on a court
Fucking bitches in my fort
We gon' play a different sport
Before we put you in dirt
Clip with a nigga, we ending your days
I will never change, I'm stuck in my ways
My niggas ain't ducking we coming abide
Talk about how i deal with the pain
Talk about flashing them niggas on stage
Niggas ain't pay you but don't want a gang of niggas that are [?] in a second
Pussy niggas need a weapon
Pussy nigga what you wreckin'
Give lil' pussy ill stretch it
Or do you think disrespectful
Your time is up, just a second
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
