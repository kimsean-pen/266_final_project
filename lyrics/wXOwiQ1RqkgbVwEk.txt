Damaged by you
Damaged by me
I'm confused
Confused,
Don't wanna be confused
Stupid attempts
No conclusions
I'm confused
Confused,
Don't wanna be confused

Put the gun to my head
And i don't pull
I'm confused
Confused,
My emotions are bruised

I no longer feel a thing
I no longer want to see
But you can't make me long
For your life and security
Problems stick,
My live drips feelings cut

Stupid feelings
Stupid illusions
I'm confused
Confused,
Don't wanna be confused
Scars for me to wear
I'm confused
Confused,
Don't wanna be confused

Things don't fit
Do i care
I'm confused
Confused,
Don't wanna be confused

I no longer feel a thing
I no longer want to see
But you can't make me long
For your life and security
Problems stick,
My live drips feelings cut
