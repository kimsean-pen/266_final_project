Sad truth
The judges rule
On who you used to be
Not what's new

Old spark
The flame burns out
We're not the same
The smoke pushes out

Was it all just a dream?
Inside a wide-eyed teen

New order
Lay it all down
The old is gone
Put it in the ground

New order
Lay it all down
The old is gone
Put it in the ground

Departure
Departure
Departure
Departure
Departure
Departure
