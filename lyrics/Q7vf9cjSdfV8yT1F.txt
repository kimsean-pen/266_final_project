Physical, spin your body round
You know the way I like
Sugar babe, take me to the moon
'Cause I'm feelin' right

Call me when you're holding it down
Yeah, and I'll come around
Baby if I'm holding a drink
It doesn't mean anything

Baby girl, you don't gotta see me
Any other night
'Cause baby I'm always a step ahead
Of your other guys

Call me when you're holding it down
Yeah, and I'll come around
Baby if I'm holding a drink
It doesn't mean anything

Keep thinking I will be your reason
To call me up, baby don't hold me up
Yeah, 'cause I like it, I like it
So baby don't hold me up
Baby don't hold me up

Sugar babe, take me to the moon
'Cause I'm feeling right

Call me when you're holding it down
Yeah, and I'll come around
Baby if I'm holding a drink
It doesn't mean anything

Keep thinking I will be your reason
To call me up, baby don't hold me up
Yeah, 'cuz I like it, I like it
So baby don't hold me up
Baby don't hold me up

Keep thinking I will be your reason
To call me up, baby don't hold me up
Yeah, 'cause I like it, I like it
So baby don't hold me up
Baby don't hold me up
