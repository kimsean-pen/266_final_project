Why ask
why not it goes with this night
so will it ever stop
will it always be this hard
there will always be a jar of ash
there will always be an unfit mind
there will always be a lonely son
there will always be a humiliated little girl
why ask
is there any reason
why ask
if it'll just let up
why ask
is there any reason
why ask
if it'll just let up
up up up up
there will always be a headless neck
there will always be happiness
there will always be a handless wrist to crush
there will always be a hopeful heart to disrespect
why ask
is there any reason
why ask
if it'll just let up
why ask
is there any reason
why ask
if it'll just let up
up up up up
