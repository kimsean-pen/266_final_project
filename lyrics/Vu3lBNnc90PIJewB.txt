Someone stung me once
The fear caught me up
Forever, forever, forever
Don't comb out my tangles because
I will, i will leave
I will leave you in the lurch my lip
Up and down
Up and down
Up and down
I can't cross the line
To share everyday with you
I can't cross the line
To share everyday with you
I can't cross the line
To share everyday with you
Sorry for the lack of bravery
Sorry for the lack of bravery
Sorry for the lack of bravery
Sorry for the lack of bravery
Sorry for the lack of bravery
Sorry for the lack of bravery
I was stung, I am sting
I was stung, I am sting
I can't cross the line
To share everyday with you
I can't cross the line
To share everyday with you
I can't cross the line
To share everyday with you
I can't cross the line
To share everyday with you
