Here, here in this world
Where do we go, where can we turn
When we need some love it seems that love
Just can't be found
Where, where do we stand
When love's supply don't meet love's demand

We got enough stars to light the sky at night
Enough sun to make the whole world bright
We got more than enough, but there's one thing
There's just not enough of

Not enough love and understanding
We could use some love
To ease these troubled times
Not enough love and understanding
Why? Oh why?

Spend all of our time building buildings up to the sky
Reaching everywhere but where we need to reach the most
Hearts never can win, oh in this race
This race that we're in

We've got enough cars to drive around the world
Enough planes to take us anywhere
We got more than enough, but there's one thing
There's just not enough of

Not enough love and understanding
We could use some love
To ease these troubled times
Not enough love and understanding
Why? Oh why?

We need some understanding
We need a little more love
Some love and understanding

Enough stars to light the sky at night
Enough sun to make the whole world bright
Enough hearts to find some love inside
We've got more than enough(but there's one thing)
There's just not enough of

Not enough love and understanding
We could use some love
To ease these troubled times
Not enough love and understanding
Why? Oh why?

We've got to find love
Got to find some love
To ease these troubled times
Not enough love and understanding
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

Tell me why, tell me why
Love and understanding
Oh why? Not enough love
Why? Why? Why?

(Not enough love and understanding)
(We could use some love)
(To ease these troubled times)
(Not enough love and understanding)
(Why? Oh why?)
(Not enough)
