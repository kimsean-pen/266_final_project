When I was a kid
The mountain was so big
Family seemed so secure
Like it would always endure
Now the purple heather's red
Everyone on Mt. Skull is dead
The black house
My uncle built still stands
But now I'm just a stranger
From suburban wastelands
Now the Shenandoah's red
Everyone on Mt. Skull is dead
Everyone I love
Everyone on Mt. Skull is dead
Everyone is dead
Everyone on Mt. Skull
