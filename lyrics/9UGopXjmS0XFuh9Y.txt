The Best Of Sister Sledge (1973-1985)

Hey Frankie?!
I was walking down the street one day
when I looked up I saw a friend.
Hey
Frankie - do you remember me?
He looked at me and then I blushed
'Cause I remembered I loved you so much.
Way back then we were friends going together
but then you left me.
Frankie - do you remember me? Frankie - do you remember?
You were fifteen
I was twelve
it was summer
we were so in love.
I never loved anyone this much
look at me
I'm thrilled to your touch.
Hey
Frankie - do you remember me?
Frankie - do you remember me?
Oh
how you brought me down - down
down.
All I did was runnin' around - around.
You'll never know how much I loved you.
Frankie - do you remember? Do you remember me? Frankie -
You walked me to the Deli
then we sat in the booth where it all began.
I looked into your big eyes
and I said to myself we coulda have twins.
Hey
Frankie - do you remember me?
Oh
how you brought me down - down
down. . . .
He looked at me and then I blushed
. . .
Frankie - do you remember me? Do you remember me
me?
Frankie
my Frankie
my baby
Frankie - do you remember me?
Frankie - do you remember me? Frankie -
