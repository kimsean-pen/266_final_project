Don't walk too close, don't breathe so soft
Don't talk so sweet, don't sing
Don't lay oh so near
Please, don't let me fall in love with you again
Please let me forget all those sweet smiles
All of the passion, all of the peace, the heat, the pain
All those blue skies where your words were my freedom
Please, don't let me fall in love with you again
Too many times I've cared too much
I stood on the edge and saw that you held my hand
And knowing too well I couldn't hide from those eyes
Please, don't let me fall in love with you again
Don't let me fall in love with you again
