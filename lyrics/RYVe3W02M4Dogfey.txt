Bones sinking like stones
All that we've fought for
Homes, places we've grown
All of us are done for

We live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do, yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world

Bones sinking like stones
All that we've fought for
Homes, places we've grown
All of us are done for

We live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do, yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world

We live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do, yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world

And, all that I know
There's nothing here to run from
'Cause yeah, everybody here's
Got somebody to lean on
