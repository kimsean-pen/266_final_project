Can I hold it down?
Have I been trying my best?
Eternal questions always asking,
feeling distressed, oh
I've been ticking more than time, a selfish man
You're a casualty I can't forget so come on and let me go

A heart glows in the night,
in the day hearts turn to dust
Say it and mean it,
so this heart learns to trust

Can I change my ways?
Can I confront the past?
Eternal questions always asking,
failing the test, oh
I've been ticking more than time,
a selfish man
You're a casualty I can't forget
so come on and let me go

A heart glows in the night,
in the day hearts turn to dust
Say it and mean it,
so this heart learns to trust
And the truth it makes no sense
my senses don't ring true
I'm feeling the pressure distorting you

Tell me we're both done, why should I listen?
Tell me we're both done, the words all go missing

Hold it down, have I been trying my best?
Eternal questions always asking,
feeling distressed, oh
So come on and let me know

A heart glows in the night
in the day hearts turn to dust
Say it and mean it
so this heart learns to trust
A heart glows in the night
in the day hearts turn to dust
Say it and mean it
so this heart learns to trust
