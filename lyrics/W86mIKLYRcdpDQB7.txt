Now you've been bad, and it goes on and on and on
'Til you come home babe, 'til you come home
Now you taste best
the poison I've learned to love has gone

I'm all alone baby, I'm all alone,
I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
And then I give a little more, ooh babe

Give a little more, ooh babe
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you baby

Get a little more from you babe
You were wrong for turning me on and on and on
And on and on

You make it so hard
I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
And then I give a little more, ooh babe

Give a little more, ooh babe
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you baby

Get a little more from you baby
I have no defense
I know you're gonna get me in the end
(gonna get me in the end)
And I cannot pretend

I ever want to feel this way again
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
Till I get a little more from you baby
Get a little more from you babe
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
Till I get a little more from you baby
Get a little more from you baby
