Day break, sun in my eyes
My bones are stiff and your still blurry, kind of like through a disguise
Like a bear in my winter cave, I'm crawling out
Some of us feel way better once the sun is out
Breathe in, Breathe out
Walk with me, tell me a story, let it all out
Breathe in, Breathe out
Everything that makes you worry, just forget about
Let the warm raindrops touch your face
kiss your eyes and lips and veins
Feel your lungs give out
take you high
Way, way closer, to them blue skies
Breathe in, Breathe out
Walk with me, tell me a story, let it all out
Breathe in, Breathe out
Everything that makes you worry, just forget about
Been walking all over this place in my mind
Digging deep, trying hard, here's what I've found
light shines through the hearts of the ones you love
Breathe in, Breathe out
Walk with me, tell me a story, let it all out
