Sunshine coming in through
The open window of my bedroom
Wildflowers at the side of the road
Caught my eye and turned my heart to stone

"Hey man, are you okay?"
That was all that I heard somebody say

Wildflowers, I am shy with a song
Totally devastated for so long

Wildflowers, I am lost in a dream
Why are we still pretending to believe?
