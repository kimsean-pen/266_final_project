Stay With Me (Unlikely) Lyrics

Sick of this mind and the games it plays
mental enemieememieenemies want to push me back again
here they come running wanting me up on that
tree, crucified

(wait a minute)
Whatever words they say (me who said it)
whomever they betray (me who did it)
whenever they're awake it makes me die

There's so much on my mind, we're given so little time
there's no way to hold on as it passes by
so lead me into denial, help me forget for awhile
stay with me, please please don't go

Stay with me, please don't go
I don't want to be alone
stay with me, please

Sick of this mind and the games it plays
mental enemieenemieenemies want to push me back again
here they come running wanting me up on that
tree, crucified

(wait a minute)
Whatever words they say (me who said it)
whomever they betray (me who did it)
whenever they're awake it makes me die

There's so much on my mind, we're given so little time
there's no way to hold on as it passes by
so lead me into denial, help me forget for awhile
stay with me, please please don't go

Stay with me, please don't go
I don't want to be alone
stay with me, please

I don't have much else to say (unlikely)
I'd rather you go away (unlikely)
I don't need something from you (unlikely)

Though some say I will heal over time
it doesn't seem too likely
it seems unlikely
please, please don't go

Stay with me, please don't go
I don't want to be alone
stay with me, please don't go
stay with me, please
