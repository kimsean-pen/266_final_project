My, my
Hey, hey
Rock and Roll
Is here to stay
It's better to burn out
Than to fade away

My, my
Hey, hey
Out of the blue
Into the black
They give you this
But you pay for that
Once you're gone
You can never come back
When you're
Out of the blue
Into the black

The King is gone
But he's not forgotten
This is the story of Johnny Rotten
It's better to burn out than it is to rust
The King is gone but he's not forgotten

Hey, hey
My, my
Rock and Roll
Can never die
There's more to the picture
Than meets the eye
Hey, hey
My, my
