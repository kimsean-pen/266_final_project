Ok, hey

Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a land-slide of emotions

I've had my share of love affairs
But they were nothing compared to this
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky
And there is fire in every kiss
Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire

When you sleep by my side
I feel safe and I know I belong
Still it's making me scared
That my love is so strong
Losing you it's a nightmare
Babe, and to me it's new
Never before did you see me begging for more

Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a land-slide of emotions

I've had my share of love affairs
But they were nothing compared to this
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky
And there is fire in every kiss
Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire

Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a land-slide of emotions
(Kisses of fire, burning, burning)
(I'm at the point of no returning)
(Kisses of fire, sweet devotions)
I'm riding higher than the sky
And there is fire in every kiss
Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire
