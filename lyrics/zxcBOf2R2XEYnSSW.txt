Oh, I'm El Dorado

Hell should be easy, after me
We both goin' anyway
You coming with me?
Now I'm rocking Prada, Hathaway
Let's get the tickets
Spilt them fifty fifty
So tell me if you're down, say it to my face
City of the gold, turn into a maze
Put the top down, I need more space
Yeah, I need more space

Oh, I'm El Dorado
Where I go you follow
We fight then we break up
We live for the make up
You swear that it's just for the sake of it

'Cause no one's gonna do you like me
Lock me up and throw away the key
You hate how much you love it, baby
I'm drippin' in gold you know
I'm El Dorado
Where I go you follow
Oh, I'm El Dorado
You know I know we won't let goIntro]
Oh, I'm El Dorado

I say hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up wait
Know I said I like you
But I really love the chase
But you know I stay a little out of reach
Because you can never get enough of me

Oh, I'm El Dorado
Where I go you follow
We fight then we break up
We live for the make up
You swear that it's just for the sake of it

'Cause no one's gonna do you like me
Lock me up and throw away the key
You hate how much you love it, baby
I'm drippin' in gold you know
I'm El Dorado
Where I go you follow
Oh, I'm El Dorado
You know I know we won't let go

You know I know we won't let go
You know I know we won't ...
'Cause no one's gonna do you like me
Lock me up and throw away the key
You hate how much you love it, baby
I'm drippin' in gold you know
I'm El Dorado
Where I go you follow
Oh, I'm El Dorado
You know I know we won't let go
