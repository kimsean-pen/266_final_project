It's a you-said-this and she-said-that
And before you know, it blows up fast
It's a teardrop falls and a slammin' door
And you don't even know what you're fightin' for

Hey, nobody said love was easy
And I know it can be kinda hard to swallow your pride
You thought "sorry" was the hardest word
You are ever gonna have to say to her in your whole life
Try sayin' goodbye
Try sayin' goodbye

Well, you fought like hell just to get this far
Yeah, you got the girl and she stole your heart
And now you're on a stool shootin' Ninety Proof
But you ain't done nothin' that you can't undo
It ain't too late

Hey, nobody said love was easy
And I know it can be kinda hard to swallow your pride
You thought "sorry" was the hardest word
You are ever gonna have to say to her in your whole life
Try sayin' goodbye
Try sayin' goodbye
Try sayin' goodbye
Yeah, oh yeah

You think you're tough
Try standin' in the dust
While the woman you love
Put you in the rearview
And drives away

Hey, nobody said love was easy
And I know it can be kinda hard to swallow your pride
You thought "sorry" was the hardest word
You are ever gonna have to say to her in your whole life
Try sayin' goodbye
Try sayin' goodbye
Oh yeah
(Try sayin' goodbye)
