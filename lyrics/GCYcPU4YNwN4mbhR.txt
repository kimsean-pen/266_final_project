Unseen, the world is made up from blackest ocean pool
Look - now the wave collapses
You appeared when I was born
Then we were two
Just like the prism pulling color out of sunlight

Entitles separated, then divide in endless twos
My atoms undetected disappear into the fizz of the unknown
Just like the prism pulling color out of sunlight
Projecting on your blinking eye, image of a second just gone by
