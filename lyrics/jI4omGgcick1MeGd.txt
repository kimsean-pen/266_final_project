When it began
Lacking a goal
Ten years I ran
In hunt for a soul

Adhesive flame
Endless it seems
Intriguing shame
Too late to redeem

Everyone knows
Honest and brave
What lies too close
Something to save

Valley in sin
This valley I'm in

Where you are
My secret star

Moving away
Nowhere to run
No one can stay
Vanishing sun

Visibly frail
Easy to see
How to prevail

Still there it lies
In rivers thin
Down in disguise
In my valley within
