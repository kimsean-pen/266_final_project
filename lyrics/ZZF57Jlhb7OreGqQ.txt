I have traveled
So far to find so little
Meaning in tragedy
Or tragedy in the search for meaning
Dark clouds have lead me here

Confined freedom guides us to security
What if everything
I have been taught is a lie
And all of my teachers
Have been wrong this whole time?

Compelling us to fight the battles they would not
They have already won
And we have already lost
If we do not learn from their mistakes
We have already lost

We have already lost
If we do not learn to change
