Your body was the one thing I wanted
You bit your bottom lip, I felt it in my bones
Heart jumps out my chest, I was haunted
I had to shake it off, when can we be alone?
How'd you get me up against the wall?
So I, I never thought that I could take the fall
And now I want it all
Are you shadows in the dark there too
Run my fingers through your hair
'Til every part of me is part of you
Now I want it all
Are you shadows in the dark there too
Run my fingers through your hair
'Til every part of me is part of you
Now I want i all
Your name on the tip of my tongue tastes
Like smoke and you fuck so incredible
You slip through the cracks fill the dead space
I had you every way, but I woke up alone
How'd you get me up against the wall?
So I, I never thought that I could take the fall
And now I want it all
Are you shadows in the dark there too
Run my fingers through your hair
'Til every part of me is part of you
Now I want it all
Are you shadows in the dark there too
Run my fingers through your hair
'Til every part of me is part of you
Now I want it all
All of me is wrapped around you
They will never hold you like I do
A thousand suns will stay and melt
Our shadows into one
Now I want it all
Now i want it all
Are you shadows in the dark there too
Run my fingers through your hair
'Til every part of me is part of you
Now I want it all
Are you shadows in the dark there too
Run my fingers through your hair
'Til every part of me is part of you
Now I want it all
