I'm sick and tired of the way that I feel
I'm sick of dreaming and it's never for real
I'm all alone with my deep thoughts
I'm all alone with my heartache and my good intentions

I work to eat and drink and sleep just to live
Feels like I'm never getting back what I give
I've got a sad song in my sweet heart
And all I really ever need is some love and attention

And I don't want to cry my whole life through
I want to do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and laugh with me

And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah, I want to do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me

Sometimes you've just got to make it for yourself
Sometimes sugar, it just takes someone else
Sometimes you've just got to make it for yourself
Sometimes baby, you just need someone else

And I don't want to cry my whole life through
I want to do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and laugh with me

And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah, I want to do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me

Sometimes you've just got to make it for yourself
Sometimes honey, it just takes someone else
Sometimes you've just got to make it for yourself
Sometimes darling, you just need someone else

But I don't want to cry my whole life through
Yeah, I want to do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and laugh with me

And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah, I want to do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me

But I don't want to cry my whole life through
Yeah, I want to do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and laugh with me

And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah, I want to do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me

But I don't want to cry my whole life through
Yeah, I want to do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and laugh with me

And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah, I want to do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me

But I don't want to cry my whole life through
Yeah, I want to do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and laugh with me

And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah, I want to do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me
