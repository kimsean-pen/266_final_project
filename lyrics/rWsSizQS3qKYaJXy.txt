I've looked outside
But I've never wandered out
I'd like to pull you into me
Intercept you, in between
But I'll never wander out
That way i'll aways
Stay away from you
That way i'll aways
Stay away from you

I've looked inside
But I never wandered in
I'd like to pull you into me
Intercept you, in between
But I'll never wander in, inside

That way i'll always
Stay away from you
That way i'll aways
Stay away from you

The universe, breaking us down
The universe, breaking us down

That way I'll always
Stay away from you
That way I'll always
Stay away from you
That way I'll always
Stay away from you, you, you, you, you
The universe, breaking us down
The universe, breaking us down
The universe, breaking us down
The universe, breaking us down
