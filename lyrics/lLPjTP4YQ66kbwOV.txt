I really
I really

Ohh, I really need to know
(I really, I really)

Ohh, or else you gotta let me go
(I really, I really)
This time I really need to do things right

Shivers that ya give me keep me freezing all night
Ya make me shudder, oh yeah
I can't believe it, I'm not myself

Suddenly I'm thinkin' about no one else
You make me shudder

I really, I really need to know
Or else you gotta let me go, ohh
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I'll give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is you and me always
Give me affection
I need your perfection

Cause you feel so good
You make me sst-stutter, stutter
Ohh

If I could touch you, I'd never let go
Now ya got me screaming and I cannot
Shut up, oh shut up yeah

Now I am lying on the bedroom floor
Barely even speaking and I cannot

Get up
And I really, I really, I really need to know
Or else ya gotta let me go, ohh
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I'll give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is you and me always
Give me affection

I need your perfection

Cause you feel so good
You make me sst-stutter, stutter
Stutter
You knock me down, I can't get up

I'm stuck here, gotta stop shaking me up
I can't eat, can't sleep, can't think
Sinking under, I'm sinkin' under
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I'll give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is you and me always
You just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
Give me affection
I need your perfection
Cause you feel so good
You make me sst-stutter (I really, I really)
You make me sst-stutter (I really, I really)
You make me sst-stutter
