(I vote for you)

I get the feeling that i'm always awake
And that i'm trying to dream but there's no one to take me there
And i vote for you

You get the feeling that you're always asleep
And if you look out and see me and touch me
I'll disappear

But i don't give a damn about your dreams
A whole world that is falling at the seams
Cuz that's what it's supposed to do

And i don't give a damn about the scene
It's my only way back to you
It seems that i'll cry into the night
And make you feel me

You call me on
Now give it up
Give it up
You alone
You call me on
Now give it up
Now give it up
You alone

I get the feeling that i'm always awake
And that i'm trying to dream but there's no one to take me there
And i vote for you

You get the feeling that you're always asleep
And if you look out and touch me and see me
I'll disappear

But i don't give a damn about your dreams
A whole that is falling at the seams
Cuz that's what it's supposed to do

And i don't give a damn about the scene
It's my only way back to you
It seems that i'll cry into the night
And make you feel me

You call me on
Give it up
Now give it up
You alone
You call me on
Now give it up
Now give it up
You alone...
