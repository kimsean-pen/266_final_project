I'm floating in a black balloon
O.D. on Easter afternoon
My mama told me, "Baby stay clean,
there's no in between."

But all you ladies and you gentlemen
Between's all you've ever seen or been
Fit poorly and arrange the sight
Doll it up in virgin white

You disappoint me
You people raking in on the world
The Devil's scrip sells
You the heart of a blackbird

Shine on me baby
'Cause it's raining in my heart

Sun's rising on a choppy glare
Rain dropping acid bought up in the air
A distorted reality is now a necessity
To be free

It's so disappointing
At first I put it all down to luck
God knows why my
Country don't give a fuck, fuck

Shine on me baby
'Cause it's raining in my heart
Shine on me baby
'Cause it's raining in my heart
