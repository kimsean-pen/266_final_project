Oh oh oh oh oh
You don't have to go oh oh oh oh
You don't have to go oh oh oh oh
You don't have to go

Ay ay ay ay ay
All those tears I cry ay ay ay ay
Ooh those tears I cry ay ay
Baby please don't go

When I read the letter you wrote me
It made me mad mad mad
When I read the words that it told me
It made me sad sad sad
I still love you so
I can't let you go
I love you - ooh baby I love you

Oh oh oh oh oh
Every breath I take oh oh oh oh
Every move I make oh oh
Baby please don't go Ay ay ay ay ay
It hurts me to my soul oh oh
It hurts me to my soul oh oh
Baby please don't go

When I read the letter you sent me
You made me mad mad mad
When I read the news that it told me
It made me sad sad sad
I still love you so
I can't let you go
I love you - ooh baby I love you

Oh you hurt me so
That's a big no no
You shouldn't hurt me

Oh oh oh oh oh
You don't have to go oh oh oh oh
You don't have to oh oh oh oh
Baby...
