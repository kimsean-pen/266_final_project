Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much

You know, there ain't no other woman that could make me feel this way (Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much)
Gets up close, you know, I just ain't got a word to say (Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much)

Please don't touch, I shake so much
Please don't touch, I shake so much

Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
You know I got so nervous, when I see his eyes that shine (Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much)
He gets up close, and the chills run down my spine (Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much)

Please don't touch, I shake so much
Please don't touch, I shake so much

Well, I don't know why she got her claws in me
'Cause I ain't fighting, baby can't you see?
Sneaking down the stairway, running like a thief
Spend the night, just shaking like a leaf

I remember the first time, I took you to a cheap motel (Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much)
I woke up drunk you know, I felt like Eskimo Nell (Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much)

Please don't touch, I shake so much
Please don't touch, I shake so much

Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much

Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
