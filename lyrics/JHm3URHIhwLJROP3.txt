Mero
Met Livy in the line
To drown the frog mouths
In the bar I already told you about
They talked of philosophical things
Like transcendence
And the opposite
Of suffering

Mero
Said he could walk
The city only
On hot fry bags, cognac bottles, and used rubbers
Livy recalled when the Giants came
I didn't care about anything
Except warm hands in the cold air
Now I am suffering
The exact opposite
And from the balcony
The sound of Greg Baise laughing
