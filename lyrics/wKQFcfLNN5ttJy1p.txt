The ones with the heart
Can do it right
Don't come to me, boy
If you ain't got the fight
Oh yeah a ha
'Cause the bells are ringin'
Hear the people singinâ€˜
Their voices growin' deeper
Ooh I am the soul speaker

You can break those chains
Right off your feet
You can jump and dance to the beat
Through the darkest night
But if your mind ain't free
It ain't worth a thing to me

A time when everything is for sale
I'm gonna give ya, give ya, give ya
Something you can't put on a shelf
The prophetic fire
Burnin' deep in my soul
Gonna show no mercy
For the new jim crow
And the ones tryin'a get ya
Get ya, get ya under control
Alright, oh yeah-yes

You can break those chains
Right off your feet
You can jump and dance to the beat
Through the darkest night
But if your mind ain't free
It ain't worth a thing to me

You can break those chains
Right off your feet
You can jump and dance to the beat
Through the darkest night
But if your mind ain't free
It ain't worth a thing to me

If your mind ain't free
If your mind ain't free
If your mind ain't free

(woah yeah)

If your mind ain't free yeah
If your mind ain't free all right
If your mind ain't free free free free yeah...
