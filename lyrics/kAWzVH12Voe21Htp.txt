The day I turn 23 I'm getting married
And shortly after
I'm getting buried
Pick up the pace, you know I got big plans
I'm talking dinner with friends, shit, shave, then six feet of sand
At least that's the plan

Once I lit it, they said you'll regret it
Consequence as thin as smoke
I swore to god I won't

This stuff is though
Got a lot more than you bargained for
And you have a hard time doing things you do
When you got so more than you wanted to

My friends are wasted
And I don't even care
I'm in my basement
Texting girls that aren't even real

My youth is gone and I know it
Pushed it too far I've outgrown it

It seems you and me
Have got a tendency
To see past common deeds
And formalities
Lying in the center of the floor
You and me and our 8 bars
Wasting time before we know it's ours

My friends are wasted
And I don't even care
I'm in my basement
Texting girls that aren't even real

My youth is gone and I know it
Pushed it too far I've outgrown it

My friends are wasted
And I don't even care
I'm in my basement
Texting girls that aren't even here

My youth is fine
Until you waste my fucking time
What a waste of fucking time
When you're telling these bitches you love 'em
'Cause you wanna fuck 'em then pay em no mind
What could be missing with pissin blue ribbon
Is this how you want it to go?

First or last, somewhere you've ashed, the cigarette,
That's going to take you down

First or last, somewhere you've ashed, the cigarette,
