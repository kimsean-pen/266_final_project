I have always been your love
I have always been your love
(You know I've been thinking)
When I think of all the places we have been
I don't know if I have been another thing
In our heads there's always been of a dream of all we longed to belong to
I don't know if I will be the same again
The same again
I have always been your love
Hand it down in open love letters
I have always been your love
Let us write ourselves in right now
I don't know if I can look away again
I don't know which way my gaze will fix to mend
In our heads there's always been a dream of all we longed to belong to
I don't know why you don't know my name and I have to remind you
I have to remind you
I have always been your love

Hand it down in open love letters
I have always been your love
Let us write ourselves in right now
I have always been your love
I have always been your love
(You know what I'm talking about
Are you wounded and dying?
I'll always be around
He won't do no harm to us
I've always had your back
So don't feel down
Cause I'll always be around)
I have always been your love
Hand it down in broken love letters
I have always been your love
Let us write ourselves in right now
I have always been your love
I have always been your love
