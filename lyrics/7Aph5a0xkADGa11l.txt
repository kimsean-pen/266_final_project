Love don't keep me waiting
All alone
Let me tell you what I need
I'm anticipating
My own prince
From a Cinderella dream
Then I looked up and there you were
With a sweet love that rocked my world
It felt like a fantasy
Up until the day you had to leave me
I needed more time
I feel cheated

One minute you came
One minute you're mine
One minute of life
One minute you leave
One minute I cry
'Cause with out your love
One minute's too much

Time just seems to stand still

Seconds tick
Each one like eternity
Only you can free me
From this jail
Only our love holds the key
I played with love and thought I'd win,
But found out all good things must end

I wish I would have known
The seconds and the minutes and the hours
It's all precious time,
And I need one more night

One minute seems so long, so long
I can never do without
Your lovin' cause it's so good, so good
You make every minute of lovin' count,

So hurry back home to me,
And love me like you used to do
I'm tellin' you I will not forget it
I won't waste one minute of love
