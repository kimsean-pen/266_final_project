This 4 tha three, this 4 tha house

This 4 tha players doing the most
This 4 tha three, this 4 tha house

I was swangin' and I swerve
Nigga like who need a curve
Old school sittin' on high
Nigga like who need some herb?
Watch for the birds, watch for them laws
Nigga they dirty as dirt
Trying to rough a nigga up, cuff a nigga up
Buss a nigga up, claiming got the work
Just cuz' we flying flossed out
Never been a worker, always bossed out
When you come from the mud, you get it out the mud
Now look at what this mud cost now
Creepin' on A street, Cali Park
Knockin' these doors down after dark
Searching for a cornbread, collared green
Eating thorough bread, thick from the start
Got it from my mama mama, but told her two for the drama
But go to college for a education
They ain't fucking with you with no commas
Goin' places in the south, buy land, own a house
Redline representer, Juneteenth turn ya' out

This 4 tha three, this 4 tha house
This 4 tha crib, this 4 tha South
This 4 tha porch, this 4 tha Sip'
This 4 tha summers, this 4 tha country
This 4 tha coast, this 4 tha buses
This 4 tha players doing the most
This 4 tha three, this 4 tha house
This 4 tha crib, this 4 tha South

What you knew 'bout that grill that chill
That top and bottom, that's invisible set
Even granny had gold for real
Even granny had gold around her neck
Gotta let your light shine
Soon as they start hating at the right time
I went from 300 coming out hard, now I'm worldwide
Ask that, I was king way before rap
Came out the womb like fuck all the rules
If there was a bar then pass that straight where the cash at
Country boy tippy-toeing (uh)
25 on the dresser (yes sir)
Did for the time, I freeze
Now batter that rustle, killing the pressure
Feeling no effort, feel like a wrestler
Put on for the Sip', watch me out rep ya
Moon-walkin', two-steppin', laying back no stretcher
Going places in the side, by land on the highs
Redline representer, queen city turn ya' out

This 4 tha three, this 4 tha highs
This 4 tha crib, this 4 tha South
This 4 tha porch, this 4 tha Sip'
This 4 tha summers, this 4 tha country
This 4 tha coast, this 4 tha buses
This 4 tha players doing the most
This 4 tha three, this 4 tha highs
This 4 tha crib, this 4 tha South
