Now that I found you, not gonna leave you
World keeps me turning
Spirits reflected
My heart beats for you

Outside my body
Tonight, in my mind's eye...
I need you to hold on

Promise the future
Dreaming in colour
Being together
Spirits reflected
Feeling is so real
Beauty is endless

Tonight in my mind's eye...
I need you to hold on

Found our guide, I sold in flight
And time came here
Our scars can't heal

This love, is our God
Our need,
how far,
Life, for a dream
Find truth in dream
Our home, Our home, Our home
Hold on!
