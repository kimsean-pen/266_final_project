Damages define our border
All that matter forged in flame
Knowing little of your wounding
Share our mending all the same

Weight of words and wars we carried
I'm like you, just like you
Eyes of secrets, storm and story
Show and tell, we'll make it through

Sadness like a pendulum
Pulls us 'round and to and fro
Onus fate and undue odium
I'm our anchor, lead and stone

By the telling, will they become?
Will they all be feathers?

Eyes of secrets, storm, and story
Show and tell, we'll make it through
Onus fate and undue odium
I'm our anchor, lead and stone

By the telling, may they become
May they all be feathers
