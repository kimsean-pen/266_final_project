Looking down on the ones who changed
So insecure, the heart is faint
One of those days he projects his rage
It's not the act he wants to stage

He took your heart
With his heart
And then he led
The man on stage is not the same
Man you've met
To the next town up ahead

Catching the feelings you want to forget
Look her on beyond upset
The bland of anger that won't rest
And look already he's on stage

He took your heart
With his heart
And then he led
The man on stage is not the same
Man you've met
To the next town up ahead

He took her heart
With his heart
And then he led
The man on stage is not the same
Man you've met
To the next town up ahead
