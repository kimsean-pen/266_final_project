So you just stepped out
of the front of my house
and I'll never see you again.
I closed my eyes for a second
and when they opened
you weren't there.
And the door shut shut
I was vacuum packed,
shrink-wrapped out of air
And the spine collapsed
and the eyes rolled back
to stare at my starving brain,

And fully clothed, I float away
(I'll float away)
Down the Forth, into the sea
I think I'll save suicide for another day.

And I picture this corpse
on the M8 hearse
and I half run away to sleep
On a rolled up coat
against the window
with the strobe of the sun
and the life I've led
am I ready to leap
is there peace beneath
the roar of the Forth road bridge?
On the Northern side
there's a Fife of mine
and a boat in the port for me,

And fully clothed, I float away
(I'll float away)
Down the Forth, into the sea
I'll steer myself
through drunken waves
these manic gulls
scream it's okay
take your life
give it a shake
gather up
all your loose change
I think I'll save suicide for another year.
