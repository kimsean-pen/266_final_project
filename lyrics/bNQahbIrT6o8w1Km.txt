Scurrying across the broadwalk
Some places I tend to forget
Echoings deep in my throat
It's so cold in this luncheonette, well

Somebody wants to know you
An ordinary boy
Somebody wants to know you
A standard polaroid, well

Here I am
European son
Sometimes the passenger
European son
Here I am

Suffragettes in Washington
Disposable serviettes
Searching for the quiet life
There's no love in this luncheonette, well

Here I am
European son
Sometimes the passenger
European son
Here I am

Here I am
European son
Sometimes the passenger
European son

European son
European son
European son
European son

Somebody wants to know you
European son
An ordinary boy
European son...
