From the mountain tops
Down to the sunny street
A different drum is playing a different kind of beat
It's like a mystery
That never ends
I see you crying and I want to kill your friends

I hear your footsteps in the street
It won't be long before we meet
It's obvious
Just count me in and count me out
And I'll be waiting for the shout
Oblivious

Met Mo and she's okay
Said no one really changed
Got different badges but they wear them just the same
Down by the ballroom
I recognized
That flaming fountain in those kindred caring eyes

I hear your footsteps in the street
It won't be long before we meet
It's obvious
Just count me in and count me out
And I'll be waiting for the shout
Oblivious

I hope it haunts me 'til I'm hopeless
I hope it hits you when you go
And sometimes on the edge of sleeping
It rises up to let me know
It's not so deep, I'm not so slow

They're calling all the shots
They'll call and say they phoned
They'll call us lonely when we're really just alone
And like a funny film
It's kinda cute
They've bought the bullets and there's no one left to shoot

I hear your footsteps in the street
It won't be long before we meet
It's obvious
Just count me in and count me out
And I'll be waiting for the shout
Oblivious

I hear your footsteps in the street
It won't be long before we meet
It's obvious
Just count me in and count me out
And I'll be waiting for the shout
Oblivious
