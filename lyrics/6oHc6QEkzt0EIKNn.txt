Now the time has come for to leave this land
Take my charge with pride sacrifice

Oooh

Lead: Andre

Running and hiding I'm left for the time
To bring back the order of devine
Hunted by goblins no Gandalf to help
With swords in the night
Oh the last part of the game
Decision of death and life
Blood for Sauron they'll call tonight
The final battle cry

Lead: Andre

Running and hiding I'm left for the time
To bring back the order of devine
There exist no tales and hobbits are crying
For all
Children of death

Lead: Andre

I have a dream
The things you've to hide for
Deliver
Our kingdom and our reich
Don't fall in panic
Just give me the thing
That I need or I kill
Don't run away
For what have I done

Refrain:
Oooh Majesty
Your kingdom is lost
And you will leave us behind
Oooh Majesty
Your kingdom is lost
And ruins remind of your time
Now come back

Solo: Andre

Refrain:
Oooh Majesty
Your kingdom is lost
And you will leave us behind
Oooh Majesty
Your kingdom is lost
And ruins remind of your time
Run, run, run

Cries
Cries in a dark land
Hear the voice it's cold as ice
Eyes
They are watching
They look for me but cannot find

Creature is following no place to escape
My last steps will find the right way
Where is the future the call of the blind
Cause there is none to find
Watch the sky you see no light
My weapons burst with fear
With the howling wolves the nazgul will die
For all
Children of death

Lead: Andre

Cries
Cries in a dark land
Hear the voice it's cold as ice
Eyes
They are watching
They look for me but cannot find
Run
Run for the whole world
It's time you cannot wait
Lost
Lost in a dark world
You feel the strange but cannot see

Too many battles we carry along from the war
And too many frightens we feel from his law
For so many victories we're praising so strong
For so many blood we've lost

Lead: Andre

Refrain:
Oooh Majesty
Your kingdom is lost
And you will leave us behind
Oooh Majesty
Your kingdom is lost
And ruins remind of your time
Run, run, run
Behind
Run, run
