Lying in my room quite late one night
Something I could see made me check my sight
Something very strange made walk outside
So I walked outside like this??

Nothing to lose and I knew I should
Ever since she told me that I was no good
It was no good, I knew it would be.

Only a shadow, only a shadow, only a shadow
but she looks like you

Only a shadow, only a shadow, only a shadow
but she looks like you

She looks like you

It's the time of year when the flower dies
It's the kind of night when the ghost will rise
Searching for the girl with the dancing eyes
Who could stay all day but leave next night

Instinct should have told me it never worked out right
Now i'm very nervous I leave on my light
But I walk outside, I walk outside
But it's

Only a shadow, only a shadow, only a shadow
but she looks like you

Only a shadow, only a shadow, only a shadow
but she looks like you

Only a shadow, only a shadow, only a shadow
but she looks like you

Only a shadow, only a shadow, only a shadow
but she looks like you

She looks like you

Listen to her voice going 'round my head
Comes to me at night when i'm in my bed
Could be going crazy, it's what they said
And what they say is i'm no good

Told me to leave, you really think I should
Haunted by your face everywhere I look
But I walk outside, and I walk to find it's

Only a shadow, only a shadow, only a shadow
but she looks like you

Only a shadow, only a shadow, only a shadow
but she looks like you

Only a shadow, only a shadow, only a shadow
