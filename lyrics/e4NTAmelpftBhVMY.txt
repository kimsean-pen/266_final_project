The God of Storms will you hear me
The shore is close but I fear it

Njord

The God of Storms will you hear me
The shore is close but I fear it
I am lost on my course to Gardarike
Caught in a fiery temper

Njord, when you touch the earth
With golden sun rays
Njord, your white palace embraced in gold
Vanir God, I am Njord

Send me waves like silk from the east
And skin of a maiden's cheeks

The ruler of winds will you save me
My hopes are strong but you guide me
I am lost on my course to Gardarike
Caught in a stormy weather

Njord, when you touch the earth
With golden sun rays
Njord, your white palace embraced in gold
Vanir God, I am Njord

Send me waves like silk from the east
And skin of a maiden's cheeks

Nine wave maidens arise

Storm lay down your sword
Silence your breath
Allay your tempest now
Ægir, be aware, be aware

Sea be calm and clear tonight
Silence your waves, Njord

Njord, when you touch the earth
With golden sun rays
Njord, your white palace embraced in gold
Vanir God, I am Njord

Send me waves like silk from the east
And skin of a maiden's cheeks

Njord, when you touch the earth
With golden sun rays
Njord, your white palace embraced in gold

Becalm your anger now

Storm lay down your sword
Ægir, be aware, be aware
