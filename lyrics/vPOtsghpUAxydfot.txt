Can you blow my whistle baby
Whistle baby, let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow

You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby
Whistle, baby, here we go

I'm betting you like people
And I'm betting you love freak mode
And I'm betting you like girls
That give love to girls and stroke your little ego

I bet you I'm guilty, your honour
That's just how we live in my genre
Who in the hell done paved the road wider
There's only one Flo and one Rida

I'm a damn shame, order more champagne
Pulled a damn hamstring, tryna put it on ya
Bet your lips spin back around corner
Slow it down baby, take a little longer

Can you blow my whistle, baby
Whistle baby, let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow

You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby
Whistle baby, here we go

Whistle baby, whistle baby
Whi-whistle baby, whistle baby
Whistle baby, whistle baby
Whi-whistle baby, whistle baby

It's like everywhere I go, my whistle ready to flow
Shorty don't even know, she can get any by the low
Tell me she not a pro, it's okay, it's under control
Show me soprano 'cause girl, you can handle

Baby, we start slow then you come up and park close
Girl, I'm the whistle man, my Bugatti the same notes
Show me your perfect pitch, you got it my banjo
Talented with your lips like you blew out a candle

So amusing
Now you can make it whistle with the music
Hope you ain't got no issue, you can do it
Even if it no picture, never lose it

Can you blow my whistle baby
Whistle baby, let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow

You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby
Whistle baby, here we go

Whistle baby, whistle baby
Whi-whistle baby, whistle baby
Whistle baby, whistle baby
Whi-whistle baby, whistle baby

Go on girl, you can twerk it
Let me see your whistle while you work it
I'ma lay it back, don't stop it
'Cause I love it how you drop it, drop it, drop it on me

Now, shorty let that whistle blow, oh-oh-oh
Yeah, baby make that whistle blow, oh-oh

Can you blow my whistle baby
Whistle baby, let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow

You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby
Whistle baby, here we go

Can you blow my whistle baby?
Whistle baby, whistle, baby
Can you blow my whistle baby?
Whi-whistle baby, whistle, baby

Can you blow my whistle baby?
Whistle baby, whistle, baby
Can you blow my whistle baby?
Whi-whistle baby, whistle, baby
