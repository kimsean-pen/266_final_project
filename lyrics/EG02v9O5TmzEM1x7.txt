You're like spring turned into winter
With you there's no in-between
Some things won't be meant to last
Too much of a good thing
Peaceful, I stepped into your water
Swam until I almost drowned
Now I'm down to one more breath
Hmm, I'm too deep to get out

Love so unkind
Once the sun light hits your eyes
I used to think that

You could be the one, be the one
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
If you look too long it leaves you blind
Baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me

Hate to say we're done, say we're done
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
And that's why I'm leaving you behind
Baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me

Faded pictures, painted like a photograph from yesterday
How could time change us so fast?
Hmm, a memory now past

Love so unkind
Once the sun light hits your eyes
I used to think that

You could be the one, be the one
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
If you look too long it leaves you blind
Oh baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me

Hate to say we're done, say we're done
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
And that's why I'm leaving you behind
Oh baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me

Nightmare dreamer, dreary lover
Used to crave it, now please change it
Only pain heals this condition now

I used to think that

You could be the one, be the one
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
If you look too long it leaves you blind
Oh baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me

Hate to say we're done, say we're done
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
And that's why I'm leaving you behind
Baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me

Oh a little for me
Oh cry just a little for me
