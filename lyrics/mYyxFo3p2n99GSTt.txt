Ooh, let me in or I'll get physical with you
I just gotta dance right now, it's critical to do
No, I haven't had no dope
Lift up the velvet rope
Mr doorman stop teasing
I'm freezing out here
See, I've got friends inside
It's my birthday tonight
And I'm not wearing trainers
Not to mention knickers
It's futile to debate
With St Peter at the gate
Made of protein milkshake
And low carb intake

Cause all in all you're just

Another prick at the door

Ooh, let me in or I'll get physical with you
I just gotta dance right now, it's critical to do
Bouncer, hey bouncer
Bouncer, bounce bounce bouncer
I just gotta dance right now, it's critical.
Ooh, bouncer, empowered and aroused
I see it in your trousers

And in the way you browse her
Look she's in!
What?! Her dress is up to waterline
That bitch is clearly borderline
Nose as white as Snow White's, in moonlight
We stand in awe in front of
Another prick at the door
Ooh, let me in or I'll get physical with you
I just gotta dance right now, it's critical to do
Bouncer, hey bouncer

Bouncer, bounce bounce bouncer

I just gotta dance right now, it's critical.

Bounce bounce bouncer
Ooh, let me in or I'll get physical
I just gotta dance right now, it's critical
So you can play karate
You thick illiterati
I'm a black belt in life
So go home to your ugly wife
You forgotten your wisdom
The window to the ladies room
A whole new possibility for a cat like me
Ooh, let me in or I'll get physical with you
I just gotta dance right now, it's critical to do.
Bouncer, bounce bounce bouncer
I just gotta dance right now, it's critical.
