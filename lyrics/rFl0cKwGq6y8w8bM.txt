Something good, oh something good, oh something good
Oh something good tonight will make me forget about you for now

Get high, hit the floor before you go
Matador, estocado, you're my blood sport

But something good, oh something good, oh something good
Oh something good tonight will make me forget about you for now

Forty eight thousand seeds, please, send rose, for my memories of you
Now that I'm fully clean, the matador is no more, he's dragged from view

Oooooo (effect)

Get high, hit the floor before you go
Matador, estocado, you're my blood sport
Forty eight thousand seeds, please, send rose, for my memories of you
Now that I am clean, the matador is no more, is dragged from view
But something good, oh something good, oh something good
Oh something good tonight made me forget about you for now
