We fail making beats for you to dance to
We fail making rhymes to romance to
We fail we're gonna make it and make it alright

I nosedive
I nosedive
I nosedive
I nosedive

I've got a fiver in a pocket somewhere
I can make it to yours on time
I don't care if this takes me nowhere
I won't and you won't, we won't ask why

I nosedive
I nosedive
I nosedive
I nosedive

You play the drums
You play the drums and we'll make the rhymes
Figured it out
I figured it all and we'll be alright

Who's there?
Who cares?

Go out and dance
I can dance if you do too
Gimme the five
We have our love and we'll be alright

Who's there?
Who cares?
