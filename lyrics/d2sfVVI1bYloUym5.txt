Look out its a space cadet
always arriving after the show has been set
to check and make sure the scene is closed
so he can prowl upon the bigger man it is known

Torturing to his car
torturing the rest to their comfort zones

howling the prey for another chance another brash refrain

Haaaa

I'm schooled and shot

space cadet hit me in the gut

impaling me on his fake intents

who knows whats next

Just a small taste
just a mild taste is all he ever craves
the king of attention gone to waste droppin a mention in conversations critics will will cringe back in hate
as he retaliates with a certain kind of opinion
single minded point of view
all made up just to use you

Oh so don't show him up
don't throw him off his golden throne
for he's the king of attention
dont distract him from his bow
oh its getting old
but you can't forget
he's the king of attention
making sure your where he's a friend

Haaaa I'm schooled and shot
space cadet hit me in the gut
and telling him its in self defence
know I know what to spect

He's a space cadet
