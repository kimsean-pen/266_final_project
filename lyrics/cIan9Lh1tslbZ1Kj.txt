Well, I'm tough, rough, ready and I'm able
To pick myself up from under this table
Don't just stick no sign on me, I got no label
I'm a little sick, unsure, unsound and unstable

But, I'm fighting my way back
Fighting my way back
Fighting

Well, I'm busting out and I'm going in
And I'm kickin' up about the state I'm in
Looking to my future, not my past
I want to be a good boy, but how long can it last?

Fighting my way back
I'm fighting my way back
Fighting

Fighting my way back
Fighting my way back
Fighting

This kid is going to wreck and ruin
And he ain't quite sure of what he's doing
You see it all a little too soon
But it's all here in this here tune

Fighting my way back
Fighting my way back

Fighting my way back
Fighting
Fighting my way back

Well, I'm busting out and I'm goin' in
And I'm kicking up about the state I'm in
'Cos I'm tough, rough, ready and I'm able
To pick myself up from under this table

Fighting my way back
Fighting my way back
