My friend once told me something so right
He said to be careful of thieves in the night
Baby, I've lost you here in the crowd
Open your arms, I want to be found

Maybe I'm calling your name in the night
Open our eyes, we'll feel with our sight

A want is a lack but also desire
A need can be nothing but should be held higher
A need is a want wearing disguise
It can be confused if fueled by desire

Baby, I'm calling your name in the night
No reason with need, look into my eyes

Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always want
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't all want

My friend once told me something so right
He said to be careful of bugs that don't bite
My friend once told me something so right
He said to be careful of thieves in the night

Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always want
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always want

Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always want
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't all want

Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always want
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always want
