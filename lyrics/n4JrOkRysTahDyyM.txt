Have faith in me, cause there are things that I've seen I don't believe
So cling to what you know and never let go
You should know things aren't always what they seem

I said I'd never let you go and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall and I always meant it
If you didn't have a chance then I never did
You'll always find me right there again

I've gone crazy, 'cause there are things in the streets I don't believe
So we'll pretend it's alright (pretend it's alright!)
And stay in for the night, what a world
I'll keep you safe here with me (with me)

I said I'd never let you go and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall and I always meant it
If you didn't have a chance then I never did
You'll always find me right there again

I said I'd never let you go and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall and I always meant it
If you didn't have a chance then I never did
You'll always find me right there again

They've got me on the outside looking in
But I can't see at all with the weight of the world on my shoulders
They just wanna see me fall

They've got me on the outside looking in
But I can't see at all with the weight of the world on my shoulders
They just wanna see me fall

I said I'd never let you go and I never did
I said I'd never let you go and I never did
I said I'd never let you go and I never did
I said I'd never let you go and I never did
