There's a power much bigger than hate
Still lost in the urge to annihilate
But I know I will overcome this
You dragged me through the darkest days
By the skin of my teeth you restored my fate
And I raised myself out of the ashes

Now I'm alive in new light
I'm alive in new light
Now I'm alive in new light
I'm alive in new light

And I was carrying the weight of the universe
The typical brittle perfectionist
Confused by my every decision
One day I was being the hero
The next I was playing the coward
Burnt out by my overreaction

Now I'm alive in new light
I'm alive in new light
Now I'm alive in new light
I'm alive in new light

There were times when I thought that my heart would stop
Running for a bleak horizon
Locked in my obsessions
And now I am the raindrop
I am the tulip
I have learned compassion

Now I'm alive in new light
I'm alive in new light
Now I'm alive in new light
I'm alive
