Yesterday you where in front of me
Woke up this morning
All of a sudden you're a memory.
Oh, if life is as short as they say it is
I guess we'll meet again sooner than we think we will.
They say a picture says a thousand words

But I would trade a thousand pictures to hear one of yours.
I'm not done saying prayers
Like I was writing your letters
Cause if heaven's far like I think it is

You wouldn't get 'em.
I know heaven must be beautiful right now
Since they got you baby
Since they got you babe

I know heaven must be beautiful right now
Since they got you babe
Since they took you babe
They say that god is full of mysteries
Sometimes I wonder if you tell him that you're missing me.
Cause I miss you everyday

Like they took someone away
Like they took color away and it's grey
Needs to get the hell away from me.
And I'm jealous of the angels - cause they see you every day

And I see you when I'm dreaming - but it doesn't feel the same
And I know my heart is broken
You can have it anyway
If I could only see you again

I know heaven must be beautiful right now
Since they got you baby
Since they got you babe
I know heaven must be beautiful right now
Since they got you baby.
Since they took you babe.

(Give my life for one last time with you, with you. 2x)
Got my spacesuit on, Gonna Blast On

Take a vacantion to where you are
Hoping Heaven ain't all that far
And you passed me by on a shooting star
'Cause I wish so bad one last chance
Take me back to the photograph
I close my eyes and I feel you laugh but all I got is a frame and a glass
Is it selfishness? Should made room for the both of us
Loneliness
I'm not lost but I've got no direction
Parachute gone and I'm falling fast
My heart has stopped but I'm still breathing
Gone numb but still I'm feeling
The less I look the more I'm seeing i just lost my hero.
I know Heaven must be beautiful right now

Since they got you baby
Since they got you baby
I know Heaven must be beautiful right know
Since they got you baby
Since they took you babe
I know Heaven must be beautiful right now
Since they got you baby
Since they got you babe
I know Heaven must be beautiful right now
Since they got you baby
Since they took you babe
