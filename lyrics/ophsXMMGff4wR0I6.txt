I saw the colossal landscape
Of which i never was a part
It was a magical day
Of which i'd never seen before

The first time i saw colossal girl
The first time i saw colossal girl

Such glowing mountains before us
Pillars of life all fade away
Of all the things i need to say girl
All of these words are in my way

The first time i saw colossal girl

Well she's running to the hills again
Can you tell me if she'll ever return
She must be mother natures child
Cause she's runnin' to the call of the wild
She's talkin' to the trees again
Tellin' me that she's one of them
Lookin' at the bird in the tree
Though she's never gonna notice me

Oh is my love a confession
Will i just put it back today
If I had love left to give you
Would you still throw it away

The first time i saw colossal girl
The first time i saw colossal girl

Well she's running to the hills again
Can you tell me if she'll ever return
She must be mother natures child
Cause she's runnin' to the call of the wild
She's talkin' to the trees again
Tellin' me that she's one of them
Lookin' at the bird in the tree
Though she's never gonna notice me

Can you remember the first time we met
Living together in colossal times
Some things are given with no reason why
Living together in colossal times

I'm just a gypsy with wondering eyes
I'll tell you secrets that send you to sleep
All i can give you is all of my love
These are the things i can give you to keep
