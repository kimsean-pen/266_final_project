Desolate ain't done no wrong
So I ride along and I write a song
Been goin' on for way too long
And on And on And on

Rain don't bother me tonight
The lights just seem to be so bright
Well, honey babe, maybe you're right
But forgot just how to fight

On and On and On and On,
Honey babe, did I do ya wrong?
On and On and On and On,
Gonna find a place where I belong

I've got a bag of tricks and a box of hats
I'm gonna make you cry; I'm gonna make you laugh
I was broken, do you remember that?
When I laid my head down on your lap

Desolate, ain't done no wrong
Well maybe if I write it in a song
And we can all just sing along
And on And on And on And on
