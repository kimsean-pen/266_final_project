Oh, you're racist
Geez, that's neat
Get the fuck up out my face with that shit
Man let's beat

Your thoughts are ugly
They're not wanted
Aaaaaand they're dumb

See, its MCID and we try to spread love, but
Man, you make me want to take of my gloves, because
Guns don't kill people, white people, kill black people, with guns
Is it hard to hear?

We're all equal
Except for you
'Cause you're an asshole, with an ugly point of view
And your insecurities
Can't you see, they're driving me insane

Maybe one day
Love will conquer all
But in the mean time, uh

Oh, you're homophobic
Wow, what a bitch
I almost wanna blow your mind and just go suck a dick

I see you're clutching that cross pretty hard though
A lot of those motherfuckers are gay
Like in a "hide your kids" kind of way
And Jesus wasn't even white on his whitest days so I guess you just went backwards from the Jump anyway

We're all equal
Except for you
'Cause you're an asshole, with an ugly point of view
And your insecurities
Can't you see, they're driving me insane

Maybe one day
Love will conquer all
But in the mean time, you can try to build your walls
Our generation
We're taking over
Hope we don't die with that
Chip on your shoulder

Maybe one day
