Remember those days, the early 90s?
We both applied for places at the same university
Ended up in London, where we needed to be
To follow our obsession with the music scene
Wherever we went, whatever we did
We knew the songs

They called us the pop kids
'Cause we loved the pop hits
And quoted the best bits
So we were the pop kids
I loved you
I loved you
They called us the pop kids

I studied history, while you did biology
To you the human body didn't hold any mystery
We were young, but imagined we were so sophisticated
Telling everyone we knew that rock was over-rated
We stayed out 'till late, five nights a week
And felt so chic

They called us the pop kids
'Cause we loved the pop hits
And quoted the best bits
So we were the pop kids
I loved you
I loved you
They called us the pop kids

The pop kids
(The pop kids, The pop kids, The pop kids)
Remember those days
Remember those days
Remember those days
Remember those days
Remember those days
Remember those days
Remember those days
Remember those days...

It was a wet Wednesday night
We were worried that no-one would be going out
How wrong we were
When we turned the corner
There was already a queue stretching down the street
We swept straight in
And you said...

Oh, I like it here
Oh, I love it
Oh, I like it here
Oh, I love it
Oh, I like it here
Oh, I love it
Oh, I like it here
Oh I am never going home
I loved you

They called us the pop kids
'Cause we loved the pop hits
And quoted the best bits
So we were the pop kids
I loved you
