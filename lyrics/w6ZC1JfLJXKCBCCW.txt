Dear God, I'm writing this letter to You
'Cause I don't have a clue, can You help me?
I'm sitting here, simply trying to figure out
What my life's all about, can You tell me?

I never wanted to be the person You see
Can You tell me who I am?
I always wanted to die but You kept me alive
Can You tell me who I am?

I lie awake conducting this symphony
That You have gifted to me but I can't ever sleep
Don't be mad but I get weak inside
And I start to fall apart 'cause I feel nothing

I never wanted to be some kind of comic relief
Please show me who I am
I've been tortured and scorned since the day that I was born
But I don't know who I am

And I thank You, man, for everything
Sorry, I'm so frightened about all of this
But I wish I could give You more
And all the lights are shining down on me
And I feel intimated by it all

I never wanted to be the person You see
But thank You

Oh God, please tell me now
Are You disappointed, are You proud?
Haven't I done everything, everything?
I'm so sorry, I'm so weak and I turned into a freak
But I don't know anything, anything

I've lost all self esteem by a billion, everything
And I feel nothing, nothing
Oh God, please tell me now
Oh God, please tell me now 'cause I feel nothing

Dear God, I'm writing this letter to you
I am coming unglued, please help me
