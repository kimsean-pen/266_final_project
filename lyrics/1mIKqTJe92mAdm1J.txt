That how you want to play it
Break my heart and go home
Why'd you want to go do that, but we're not even in the way

That how you want to sing it
I've been having loads of fun
I think I've heard that song before it ends up in a 'book?'

That how you want to see it
If you just have a 'tongue?'
Tunnel vision, have a listen, no we're never going home

You're a good time killer
Why did you end up on your own
Overlook ...

You told the fortune teller
The crystal ball is going to show
... going to tell up the truth so I don't know

Sea has got something stirring
On the currents down below
There's a beach out of reach, gotta get up so we can go

'Crystal leaks?' start all over
Switch it up an overhaul
There's nothing like anytime, speed it up until we wall

...
Scratch the writing on the wall
All the friends on your end call you back from Montreal
