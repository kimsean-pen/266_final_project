You've got some eyes on you
I swear they follow me
They cut so heavily
One look to split my wounds
And every drop put me under
I bleed for you

You've got a mouth on you
Give me the antidote
Stop me disappearing
Bring me the fountain of youth
(Twist?) your pouty lips are made just for
Just for late night, fucked up, dark room fashions

Nobody moves like you do
(And you know my?) tired eyes
Try to find you every night
Nobody else???
6am and do it again, do it again

Slow down and catch your breath
??? still spiralling
At least thats what's in my head
The infinite glowing light of your love for me

Thats when i talk to you
??? fucked up to the pixels?
If i could just talk to you face to face
I'm sure i would say whatever melts your heart
Dont look away
