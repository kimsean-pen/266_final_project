You should've seen by the look in my eyes, that there was something missing
You should've known by the tone of my voice, but you didn't listen
You play dead, but you never bled
Instead you lie still in the grass all coiled up and hissing

And I know all about those men, still I don't remember
Because it was us baby way before them and we're still together

And I meant every word I said when I said that I love you I meant that I love you forever
And I'm gonna keep on loving you
Because it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep, I just wanna keep on loving you

And I meant every word I said when I said that I love you I meant that I loved you forever
And I'm gonna keep on loving you
Because it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep, I just wanna keep on loving you

I don't wanna sleep, I just wanna keep on loving you
