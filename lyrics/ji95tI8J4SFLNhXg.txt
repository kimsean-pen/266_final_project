Cause he's still coming around like an injured bird needing a nest
A place to rest his head in a song you'll regret
Still you take him, Lord knows I don't want to compete
Still I sleep in the very sheets he's been in

Swallow him whole like a pill that makes you choke, steals your soul
You have the nerve to look me in the eyes and lie
Send him back, I won't share the trap that you have me in

Is he still coming around like an injured bird needing a nest
A place to rest his head in a song you'll regret
Still you take him, Lord knows I don't want to compete
Still I sleep in the very sheets he's been in

Swallow him whole like a pill that makes you choke, steals your soul
You have the nerve to look me in the eyes and lie
Send him back, I won't share the trap that you have me in

Still I sleep in the very sheets he's been in
