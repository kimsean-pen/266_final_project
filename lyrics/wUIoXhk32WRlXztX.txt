I kissed the road, I kissed the road
And I came home to the love you gave
And as I walked through my door I saw the stars spelled out: saved
And all the gardens bloomed a flower for each day I was away

Now I'm saved
Baby, saved

And I was alive
And I was alive
And I was alive
And I was alive

You and me, we're more than on the run
Busting at the heavens like the horses of the sun
You and me, we're more than on the run
Busting at the heavens like the horses of the sun

I kissed the road, I kissed the road
And I came home to the love you gave
And as I walked through my door I saw the stars spelled out: saved
And all the gardens bloomed a flower for each day I was away

Now I'm saved
Baby, saved

And I was alive
And I was alive
And I was alive
And I was alive

You and me, we're more than on the run
Busting at the heavens like the horses of the sun
You and me, we're more than on the run
Busting at the heavens like the horses of the sun

You and me, we're more than on the run
Busting at the heavens like the horses of the sun
You and me, we're more than on the run
Busting at the heavens like the horses of the sun
