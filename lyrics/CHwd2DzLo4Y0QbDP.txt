I try my best to keep you here
But it's hard to hold a shadow
You said goodbye but I couldn't hear
Too busy praying for a miracle

And you left me on my knees
You just walked out the door
You didn't even have the decency to intervene
While I was begging God for you to love me

I prayed about us every night, mhmm
Boy I know you had to hear me
You could have stopped me then and told the truth
But instead, you put a pillow over your head

Oh, and you left me on my knees, yeah
You just walked out the door, babe
You didn't even have the decency to intervene
While I was begging God for you to love me

You should have told me it was useless
That I was praying empty prayers, yeah
But you hopped in your car, pulled out your keys
While you were leaving, I was begging God for you to love me

And I know that He has something better to do
Than to sit and listen to a broken-hearted fool
Could have been saving the world from a tragedy
But instead He was listening to me
I was asking, beggin' for a sign
To bring comfort to this lonely heart of mine
But apparently you're not what I need
I guess you walking out was Him answering

You left me on my knees, baby
You just walked out the door
You didn't even have the decency to intervene
While I was begging God for you to love me

I try my best to keep you here
But it's hard to hold a shadow
