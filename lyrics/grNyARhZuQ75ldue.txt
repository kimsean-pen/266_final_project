You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me

I wish we could have another minute
To finish this fairytale
Hear your voice and get lost in it
'Cause all I got is broken details.
You were my world and everything in it
So how did you disappear
I won't say this is over
You're still here

You're my shadow, my shadow
I know you're close
You're my shadow, my shadow
Everywhere I go
So I, I don't see the need to cry cause
You'll never leave my life
You're my shadow, my shadow, oh

You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
No, you'll never leave me

I won't forget, I'll just sit and reminisce
Promise I'll keep all your secrets
To have you back would be my only wish
('cause nobody knew me like you did)
The words will come to life I've written in my diary
Hide and seek but I know you'll always find me
Count to ten and I know you will appear, appear-pear no fear

I'm here, here

You're my shadow, my shadow
I know you're close
You're my shadow, my shadow
Everywhere I go
So I, I don't see the need to cry cause
You'll never leave my life
You're my shadow, my shadow, oh
You'll never leave me

Now your gone and I swear you won't be alone
My heart beat tapping like it's made of stone
I won't let you down, mute the sound
But I can still hear
Yeah
And now I'm breaking
See I'm shaking
But I know you're waiting
Yeah yeah

You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
No, you'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me

You're my shadow, my shadow
I know you're close
You're my shadow, my shadow
Everywhere I go,
So I, I don't see the need to cry cause
You'll never leave my life
You're my shadow, my shadow, oh
Oh oh oh oh

You're my shadow, my shadow
I know you're close
You're my shadow, my shadow
Everywhere I go
So I, I don't see the need to cry cause
You'll never leave my life
You're my shadow, my shadow, oh

You'll never leave me
No
Please don't ever leave me
No, no
No, no
Oh
