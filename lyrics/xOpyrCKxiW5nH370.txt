Leaving home tonight
Gimme a ride
Paint my lips and nails rebel black
I'm not coming back
Leaving home tonight
Gimme a ride
Paint my lips and nails rebel black
I'm not coming back

Yesterday you told me
I'm dying here, let's get outta here

Nothing's here I would miss
With my hair waving on the breeze
Somebody's arm over my shoulder
And no use in having to grow older

Nothing's here to make me stay
When the sun flares in an ashtray
And neon lights shine down right on me
Am I still young and finally free

Gonna make my living on
Writing silly songs
Leaning outta window to cry
Love is not a crime
Gonna make my living on
Writing silly songs
Leaning outta window to cry
Love is not a crime

Yesterday you told me
I'm dying here, let's get outta here

Nothing's here I would miss
With my hair waving on the breeze
Somebody's arm over my shoulder
And no use in having to grow older

Nothing's here to make me stay
When the sun flares in an ashtray
And neon lights shine down right on me
Am I still young and finally free
