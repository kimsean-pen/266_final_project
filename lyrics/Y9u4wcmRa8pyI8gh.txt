Heart of darkness, untouched by the light
No god can forgive these sins
Cleansing ritual, purify
Prepare the sacrifice

Absolution denied
Stains only blood can wash away
A forsaken life
Rid the world of this plague
Lower the blade

No, the hangman's noose won't do for you
Your reign of torment ends in bloodshed
With a fall of the axe your death comes to pass
Staining the ground below crimson red

Absolution denied
Stains only blood can wash away
A forsaken life
Rid the world of this plague
Lower the blade

1000 daggers
Drawn to open your throat
And every drop you bleed
Will poison the earth below

Rotting beneath the spoiled ground
No mourners to visit my desolate grave
And here l remain, buried in hate

Absolution denied
Stains only blood can wash away
A forsaken life
Rid the world of this plague
Lower the blade
