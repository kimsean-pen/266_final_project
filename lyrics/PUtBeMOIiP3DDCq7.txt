Luck loves me not tonight, I'm running out
This four leaf clover's all, but useless now
I've got four wheels that say I'm not alone tonight

I'm always looking for a joy ride through
The brightest part of this town

Break out, break out
As we escape through the windows
Head for the car, and never look back
Singing, singing

Break out, break out
Our time has come and we've got
These big city dreams

Put up or shut up, we're not wasting time again
The credits are rolling and we're getting lost again
In parking lots, to serenading sirens
As the blue lights bathes our smiles

Break out, break out
As we escape through the windows
Head for the car, and never look back
Singing, singing

Break out, break out
Our time has come and
We've got these big city dreams

Let's take a moment to reflect
On the past few years of my life
I haven't worked myself away to stay inside
This is the time to let us

Break out, break out
As we escape through the windows
Head for the car, and never look back
Singing, singing

Break out, break out
Our time has come and
We've got these big city dreams
