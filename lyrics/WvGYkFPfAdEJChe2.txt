I'll bet they say the same damn thing
Got niggas paying top dolla to holla
Talking about they pretty brown frame
And I don't mean the Impala
That you just hopped out of
Go on 'bout ya business
You must be religious
God done took her time
And you're tired of hearing those same old lines

Talk to you 'bout something new
Didn't look the same to you
Talk to you 'bout something new
I don't wanna get home with you
Talk to you 'bout something new
Take a look, the same to you
Talk to you 'bout something new
I don't wanna get home with you

Truth is, I came to know ya
Don't give a damn about the things they told ya
'Cause they don't have a clue
But they don't need you like I do
You don't need champagne
You'd rather be held tight and maintained
I wanna know everything about you
But first I gotta talk to you

Talk to you 'bout something new
Didn't look the same to you
Talk to you 'bout something new
I don't wanna get home with you
Talk to you 'bout something new
Take a look, the same to you
Talk to you 'bout something new
I don't wanna get home with you

If you don't mind
I wanna be the only one on your mind
And if you don't mind
I wanna get the chance to spend some time
Can I talk to you?

Can I talk to you?

Talk to you 'bout something new
Didn't look the same to you
Talk to you 'bout something new
I don't wanna get home with you
Talk to you 'bout something new
Take a look, the same to you
Talk to you 'bout something new
I don't wanna get home with you
