Half-mast land grants homesteading laws
Past Dodge Summit toward Athabasca Falls
Practicing our Avocets and Gnatcatcher calls
I laid down my guns where the soldierfish swam
And slept inside the shoe of the world's tallest man
I saw Charlotte Corday with the knife in her hand
"It was nothing new"
I've perched on Steele Dakota's sandhill crane
I flew among the Paiute before the Mormon rain
I was in Virginia City for the stringing up of Clubfoot Lane
But I've never seen anything like you

All untied, by and by
But I'd pour the matrimony wine
All untied, by and by!
So if you're ever so inclined
Oh if you're ever so inclined
Oh if you're ever so inclined
While low in a lodgepole branch nearby
A lovesick Barnyard an amorous eye

What unprecedented gift does this afternoon provide
What from the air now calls to water on the land
What from my seclusion does this charlatan demand
What to do now with my best-laid eremetic plans

I've been to the Arfaks where the Sicklebills fly
Seen Tangier's acrobatics nine stories high
I was there at Appomattox back in '65
When the General arrived
But I've never been in this room before

All untied, by and by
That same old dream's trapped in my mind
All untied, by and by
I'm bound in ropes and on the firing line
All untied, by and by
well I wake up disappointed every time
I wake up disappointed every time
I wake up disappointed every time
I wake up disappointed every time
I wake up disappointed every time

If the weather ever withers up your vine
Jacob knows a ladder you can climb
If that old thorn is still buried in your side
Jacob knows a ladder you can climb

Well if your pacific rivers all run dry
Their clouds will fill my loud corrupted sky
And if the pleasures of your heavens ever end
That very ladder just as well descends

If the weather ever withers up your vine
Jacob knows a ladder you can climb
If that old thorn is still buried in your side
Jacob knows a ladder you can climb

Well if your pacific rivers all run dry
Their clouds will fill my loud corrupted sky
And if the pleasures of your heavens ever end
That very ladder just as well descends
