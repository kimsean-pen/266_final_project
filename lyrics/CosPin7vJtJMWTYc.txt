Ripped jeans, only drinks whiskey
I find him by the fire while his girl was getting frisky, oh...
I say we go this road tonight

He smiles, his arm's around her
But his eyes are holdin' me, just a captive to his wonder, oh...
I say we go this road tonight

And now, I know that that's your girl, I mean no disrespect
The way that shirt hugs your chest, boy, I just won't forget
I'll be sittin' here, drinking my whiskey
I won't say goodnight unless I think ya might miss me, oh...

Be my All-American boy tonight
Where everyday's the 4th of July
It's alright, alright
And we can keep this up till the morning light
And you can hold me deep in your eyes
It's alright, alright
So be my, be my
My All-American boy

Ripped jeans, tight shirt
He lights a cigarette - you know
I'm glad that she can't stand it, oh...
I drink the moonlight from his eyes

Now hold there, just a moment
I want to take this in now, we don't need no photo of it, no...
We should go this road tonight

Now, I know that that's your girl, and I don't give a damn
She's been cursin' and cryin', she don't know what she has
So I'll be sittin' here, tryin' hold down my whiskey
You tell your girl "good night"
'cause somebody'd like to kiss me, oh...

Be my All-American boy tonight
Where everyday's the 4th of July
It's alright, alright
And we can keep this up till the morning light
And you can hold me deep in your eyes
It's alright, alright
So be my, be my

My All-American boy
Of all the girls and boys to look my way
Ain't nobody ever hit me this way
So won't you come back with me
And lay with me awhile
I'm gonna wrestle you out of them clothes
Leave that beautiful body exposed
And you can have my heart and my soul and my body...

Oh, be mine!
Be my All-American boy tonight
Baby, you light my fire
I'll make you feel alright, alright
And we can keep this up till the morning light
And you can hold me deep in your eyes
It's alright, alright
So be my, be my
Just...
Be my, be my
My All-American boy...
