FEAR

We're still struggling
Halfway through this journey
Our eyes are burning but we're not slowing down
I wish we could have all the time in the world
But we have come too far
To give up who we are

We fear nothing

We fear nothing
Life long
Road blocks
High walls
Teardrops
Nothing stands in our way

Blood stained
Stock crash
Mistakes
Heart breaks
Nothing stands in our way

We're still running
We are not afraid the thrill is on
Speed up without any brakes
Oh no
'Cause sometimes we still have to hit the wall
To see things that are right before our eyes

We fear nothing

We fear nothing
Life long
Road blocks
High walls
Teardrops
Nothing stands in our way

Blood stained
Stock crash
Mistakes
Heart breaks
Nothing stands in our way

We fear nothing
We fear nothing
Now that we've come so far
Do you still remember our dreams
The need to have it all?
Don't give up
I feel we are almost there

LIFE LONG
ROAD BLOCKS
HIGH WALLS
TEARDROPS
Nothing stands in our WAY
BLOOD STAINED

STOCK CRASH
MISTAKES
HEART BREAKS
Nothing stands in our WAY
Life long

Road blocks

High walls
Teardrops
Nothing stands in our way
Blood stained
Stock crash
Mistakes
Heart breaks
Nothing stands in our way
That's our way
That's our way
That's our way
That's our way
That's our way
That's our way
That's our way
