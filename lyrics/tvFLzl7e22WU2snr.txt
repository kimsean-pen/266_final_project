I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where they drink champagne
And it tastes just like cherry Cola C-O-L-A cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
L-O-L-A Lola Lo lo lo lo Lo - la

Well I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she almost broke my spine
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walks like a woman but talks like a man
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candle light
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said "little boy won't you come home with me?"
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy,
But when I looked in her eyes, well I almost fell for my
Lola Lo lo lo lo Lo - la Lo lo lo lo Lo - la
Lola Lo lo lo lo Lo - la Lo lo lo lo Lo - la

I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I went down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at me

Well that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Girl will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up muddled up sup world except for Lola
La-la-la-la Lola

Well I left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said "Little boy, I'm gonna make you a man"

Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad that I'm a man
And so is Lola
La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
