No sleep tonight
We're on the night train
To anywhere but here
It takes us far
Into a fantasy
Where all the good things are

And it all makes sense when we close our eyes
'Cause we are looking through pink cellophane, cellophane
All those years we've spent running away, we'd never meet
That it was meant to be
That it was meant to be

No time to find
We're always losing
Without a single care
It makes us fear
We're in a movie scene
And nothing else is real

And it all makes sense when we close our eyes
'Cause we are looking through pink cellophane, cellophane
All those years we've spent running away, we'd never meet
That it was meant to be
That it was meant to be

All those years we've spent running away, we'd never meet
That it was meant to be
That it was meant to be

And it all makes sense when we close our eyes
'Cause we are looking through pink cellophane, cellophane

That it was meant to be
That it was meant to be
(All those years we've spent running away)
That it was meant to be
That it was meant to be

No sleep tonight
We're on the night train
