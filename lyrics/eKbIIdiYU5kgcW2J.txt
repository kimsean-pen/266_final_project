Tough times never last though people always do
And so being tough is something you will have to choose
Choose to abandon the fear of your own death
Accept a future you can hold in own your hand
You will be the first to find the edge of what is possible
For a man

I will live for a thousand years
I will live for a thousand years
No more will I be ruled by fear
I will live for a thousand years

Removing all your fear of mortality
A million precious moments can survive eternally
With a mind that will endure and overcome
Ten hundreds lifetimes become your to live as one
You will be the first to find the edge of what is possible
For a man

I will live for a thousand years
I will live for a thousand years
No more will I be ruled by fear
I will live for a thousand years
