Digging deeper for a way out
Nightfall comes but we're not done
Falling further to the future
Reminisce where we belong

We are stranger to ourselves
We are stranger to ourselves
We are stranger to ourselves
We are stranger to ourselves

Sleeping through another season
Troubled by what falls away
Symbols pass for no good reason
Hidden world that I can tame

We are stranger to ourselves
