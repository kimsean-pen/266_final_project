The second someone mentioned you were all alone
I could feel the trouble coursing throught your veins
Now I know, it's got a hold
Just a phone call left unasnwered, had me sparkin' up
These cigarrettes won't stop me wonderin' where you are
Don't let go, keep a hold
If you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill
Guidin' like a lighthouse to a place where you'll be
Safe to feel our grace 'cause we've all made mistakes
If you've lost your way...
I will leave a light on
Well I will leave a light on
Well I will leave a light on
I will leave a light on
Tell me what's been happening, what's been on your mind
Lately you're been searchin' for a darker place
To hide, that's alright
But if you carry on abusing, you'll be robbed from mine
I refuse to lose another friend to drugs
Just come home, don't let go
'Cause If you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill
Guiding like a lighthouse to a place where you'll be
Safe to feel our grace 'cause we've all made mistakes
If you've lost your way...
Well I will leave a light on
Well I will leave a light on
Well I will leave a light on
Well I will leave a light on
If you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill
Guiding like a lighthouse, it's a place where you'll be
Safe to feel our grace and If you've
lost your way(If you've lost your way)
And I know you're down and out now, but I need you to be brave
Hiding from the truth ain't gonna make this all okay
I feel your pain if you don't feel our grace
And you've lost your way
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
Well I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
