Whoa!
It started on a weekend in May
I was looking for attention
Needed intervention
Felt somebody looking at me
With a powder white complextion
Feeling the connection

The way she looked was so ridiculous
Every single step had me waiting for the next
Before I knew it, it was serious
Dragged me out of the bar
To the backseat of her car

When the lights go out,
She's all I ever think about
The picture burning in my brain
Kissing in the rain
No, I can't forget my English love affair
Today, i'm seven thousand miles away
The movie playing in my head
Of her king sized bed
Means I can't forget my English love affair
Uh uh uh uh
My English love affair!

Next thing, we were back at her place
A hideaway in Mayfair
All the great and good there
Drinking all the way to third base
Princess getting naked
(Falling on their faces)

The storyline is so ridiculous
Every single step
Had me begging for the next
Before I knew it, it was serious
Dragged me up the stairs, and it wasn't ending there

When the lights go out
She's all I ever think about
The picture burning in my brain
Kissing in the rain
No, I can't forget my English love affair
Today, i'm seven thousand miles away
The movie playing in my head
Of her king sized bed
Means I can't forget my English love affair
Oh oh oh oh

When I got out I knew
That nobody I knew would be believing me
I look back now and know
That nobody could ever take the memory

When the lights go out
She's all I ever think about(think about)
The picture burning in my brain
Kissing in the rain
No, I can't forget my English love affair
Today, i'm seven thousand miles away
The movie playing in my head
Of her king sized bed
Means I can't forget my English love affair

Oh oh oh oh
My English love affair!
Oh oh oh oh
My English love affair!
