Walking through the night
I see you away
Lady of the waters I'm here

A woman in the stars
Praise a new age
Drawing sings on the moon

And for 2000 years
A new time awaits
Glory, Harmony and Truth

On pisces only cries
In Crete Zeus acclaimed
The dawning of the Age of Aquarius!!!

Ganymede was the son of Tros
Phrygian Youth, the king of Troy
The symbol of the Aquarius constellation

While tending to his father's flocks
On the Mountida was spotted
By Jupiter deity God's lightning bolt

New times havecome bring light to your soul
(Bring light to your soul Aquarius
New times have come the son of God)
Aquarius the son of God

We gotta change. Change
Now is time to change. Change.
You are the leader to your dreams enlightenment
Change!
Now is time to change. Change.

You got to free your mind and keep your spirir strong
According t.o the prophets warning
Theres's an age of shadows coming
The displeasure of God in premonitions
Around us, swords, arrows and lances weapons of all kinds
To tame us but we're willing to win new resistence

New times havecome bring light to your soul
(Bring light to your soul Aquarius
New times have come the son of God)
Aquarius the son of God

We gotta change. Change
Now is time to change. Change.
You are the leader to your dreams enlightenment
Change!
Now is time to change. Change.

You got to free your mind and keep your spirir strong. Go!

Aquarius the son of God
We gotta change. Change
Now is time to change. Change.
You are the leader to your dreams enlightenment
Change!
Now is time to change. Change.

You got to free your mind and keep your spirir strong.

Aquarius
