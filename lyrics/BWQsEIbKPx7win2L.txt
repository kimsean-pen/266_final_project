Back to you
It always comes around, back to you
I tried to forget you, I tried to stay away
But it's too late

Over you
I'm never over, over you
Something about you
It's just the way you move
The way you move me

Yeahhh I'm so good at forgetting
And I quit every game I play
But forgive me, love
I can't turn and walk away

Back to you
It always comes around, back to you
I walk with your shadow
I'm sleeping in my bed
With your silhouette

Yeahhh, should have smiled in that picture
If it's the last that I'll see of you
It's the least that you
Could not do

Leave the light on
I'll never give up on you
Leave the light on
For me too, for me too
For me too

Back to me
I know that it comes back to me
Doesn't it scare you
Your will is not as strong
As it used to be
