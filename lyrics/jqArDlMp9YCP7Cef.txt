You run through the forest
Away from it all
You soak in the current
With your back to the wall
You swim through the tides
When the summer calls
You follow the sounds of
The waterfall

I follow to the edge
And I fall to the floor
I swim in circles
And I drift evermore
It seems I can't remember
Who I was before
I'm floating in an ocean
That I can't explore

But I can hang on to the surface
In flowing, oscillated time
My lungs are filling up with water
But I won't sink to the void

I climbed to the top
Of the fiery wall
I swallowed my emotions
And embraced the fall
Exploring through the silence
Of the shadows call
I'm swimming through the current
And I feel it all

But I can hang on to the surface
In flowing, oscillated time
My lungs are filling up with water
But I won't sink to the void
