It's not that I don't want you here (yeah, yeah)
It's something about the way you stare into my eyes
I know that I don't make things clear (no)
I fall for you every time I try to resist you

We can get away
Palm trees, beach views
Ordinary day
All I wanna hear is inner visions on replay
And sit right next to you, you
I try not to show how I feel about you
Thinking we should wait, but we don't really want to
I just wanna get away
And sit right next to you, you

I don't wanna kiss you
Yeah, I just wanna feel you
Feel you

I want you around (around)
Around
I want you around (around)
Around ('round, 'round, 'round)
I want you around
Around
I want you around
Around, around, 'round, 'round
(I want you around)

Come through, I think I need you here
(But) I swear it's hard to keep these feelings to myself
Now you're the one I'm thinking of
My higher ground, my rocket love
Fuck gravity, I'd rather stay up here, but...

We can get away
Palm trees, beach views

I just wanna get away
And sit right next to you, you

I don't wanna kiss you
Yeah, I just wanna feel you
Feel you

I want you around (around)
Around
I want you around (around)
Around ('round, 'round)
I want you around
(Darling, I want you, yeah, yeah)
Around
I want you around
(I want you around, yeah, yeah)
Around, around, 'round, 'round

(I want you around)
('Round, 'round, 'round, 'round)
(Oh, 'round)
('Round, 'round, 'round, 'round)
('Round, 'round, 'round)
(Want you around)
