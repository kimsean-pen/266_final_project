All this time
I'd never let you go
And never seem chasing kept you in there
Holding down my soul
I set you up
I give you life
I dragged you out the fire
Now you knock me down and shut me out
And I can see it in your eyes

So, now you've got it in your head
That you could make it on your own
You were sheltered, loved and fed
But you just couldn't leave it alone

Leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone

But your heart was here
Resting on my lap
And I'd do it all again
But I'll never coming back
Well, I know I'm lying
Lying in the cold
Yeah, the snow on the ground
And if I know myself
I'll be leaving down the road

I've been all around the world
But I've got no were to go
I give into this lonely life and you can't change me now

So leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone
Leave it alone

The ghosts are on the green
Each and every night
Oh, the distant light
That's the hardest part to take
That's the heart of all my pain
Lying in the cold
Ah, the distant light
Yeah, in here we can't describe
Still we know

Could it all be over now?
We've seen it all the while
There's no dimension to the clouds
The moon and world around
That's the heart of all my pain
'Cause I don't wanna go
Oh, the distant light
Yeah, in here we can't describe
Still we know
