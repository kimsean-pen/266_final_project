How long will I fly out until I listen
Truth is I'm used to making it up on my own
How long will I climb out I never listen
I'm in remission

No more wide eyes
I can't pretend
I can't pretend
No morning cries
I can't pretend
It's not the end

How long will I say yes over my conscience
Truth is I'm wasted before I take it all in
How long will I blame it all on past life tragedy
There's no remedy

No more wide eyes
I can't pretend
I can't pretend
No morning cries
It's not the end
No, It's not the end
No more wide eyes
I Can't pretend
No, I can't pretend
No morning cries
It's not the end
No, It's not the end
