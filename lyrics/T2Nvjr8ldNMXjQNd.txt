As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
And looked down and noticed I got a flat

So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a stranged feeling like a mist, so

I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said 'Don't you worry my friend I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there'

(Ooo!)

Take me to a place without no name
(no name)
Take me to a place without no name
(without no name)

As she took me right through the fog (Ah)
I've seen a beautiful city appear
Of where kids are playin' and people are laughin'
and are smilin' and nothin' to fear

She said this is the place where no people have pain
with Love and happiness
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'
and grabbed my hand, 'You've got a friend'

(Woooo!)

Take me to a place without no name
(A place without no name) (no name)
Take me to a place without no name
(A place without) (A place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name
(Take me) (Take me) (A place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name
(A place without) (Hooo)

(Yeah) (Doggone) (Hoh)

She started liking me, kissing me and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen and things I've never done
It really looked like a lot of fun

I've seen the grass and the skies and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with Love and happiness
I wonder where could I wanna leave

So then I went in my pocket took my wallet all out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world

(Oooh)

Take me to a place without no name
(Doggone) (Take me) (no name)
Take me to a place without no name
(See, a place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name
(Take me) (Doggone) (A place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name
(See, a place without)

(No-No-Nooo!)
