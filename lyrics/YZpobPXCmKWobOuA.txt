They said this fun is near the end
You've worn out welcome way too fast
You better bite your tongue

I need an island
And I need it fast
Some little island
Is all I ask

To put you on
To put you on

Stay there don't move
I think it's got fangs
Watch if they turn
Become the villains

Are you allowed to know
Are we allowed to know
Are you allowed to know

Just an island
Is all I ask
Some little island
A spot to cast

To put you on
To put you on

Force you to go

Some little island
One little island

To put you on
To put you on
To put you on
To put you on
