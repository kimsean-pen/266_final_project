I've been giving favours left and right
I've been wasting days and wasting nights
I left the window open wide
I let the air release my mind

My body's changing
My body's changing
My body's aching

I'll cut the strings from your hand
I'll start to walk again
(Give up or give in)
I'll shut you out if I can
Don't owe you anything

I shouldn't wait, I shouldn't doubt
I can't be arsed with you right now
I have a chance to take it out
I want it all, I want it now

My body's changing
My body's changing
My body's aching

I'll cut the strings from your hand
I'll start to walk again
I'll shut you out if I can
Don't owe you anything

I'll cut the strings from your hand
I'll start to walk again
(Give up or give in)
I'll shut you out if I can
Don't owe you anything
(You get what you're given)

I'll cut the strings from your hand
I'll shut you out if I can
Give up or give in
You get what you're given
Give up or give in
You get what you're given
