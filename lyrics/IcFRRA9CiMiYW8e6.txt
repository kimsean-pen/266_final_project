And it's a combination of reality and my imagination
I cannot tell you my anxiety for the moment
I get angry at myself for trying to impress you
I cannot rectify my embarrassment on the subject

Always on a knife's edge here with you
We're faded I love you
You know my worry only comes from wanting more for you
I get low with you
I hate it when we're blue
You know my worry only comes from fear of what I do

I just really wanted to feel accepted
I just really wanted to feel connected
Ahh I'm selfish and maybe I'm a little bit narcissistic
To be ever grateful with the end characteristic

Always on a knife's edge here with you
We're faded I love you
You know my worry only comes from wanting more for you
I get low with you
I hate it when we're blue
You know my worry only comes from fear of what I do

I love that I can say I wouldn't feel this way without ya
I love that I can say I wouldn't feel this way without you

I'm willing to get better from no disease at all
I'm evicted and conflicted at my very core
The love is loving on and on and on
Achievable intellectual and emotionally viable

Always on a knife's edge here with you
We're faded I love you
You know my worry only comes from wanting more for you
I get low with you
I hate it when we're through
You know my worry only comes from fear of what I do

I love that I can say I wouldn't feel this way without ya
I love that I can say I wouldn't feel this way without you
