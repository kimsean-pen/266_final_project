All the clever
Things I should say to you
They got stuck somewhere
Stuck between me and you

Oh, I'm nervous
I don't know what to do
Light a cigarette
Only smoke when I'm with you, oh

What the hell do I do that for?
Oh, you're just another guy
Oh, okay, you're kind of sexy
But you're not really special

But I won't mind
If you take me home
Come on, take me home

I won't mind
If you take off all your clothes
Come on take 'em off

'Cause I like you so much better when you're naked
I like me so much better when you're naked
I like you so much better when you're naked
I like me so much better when you're naked

All the clever
Things I should say to you
They got stuck somewhere, stuck somewhere
Stuck between me and you

Oh, I'm nervous, I'm so nervous
I don't know what to do
Light a cigarette
Only smoke when I'm with you, oh

What the hell do I do that for?
Oh, you're just another guy
Oh, okay, you're kind of sexy
Oh, but you're not really special

But I won't mind
If you take me home
Come on, take me home

I won't mind
If you take off all your clothes
Come on take 'em off

'Cause I like you so much better when you're naked
I like me so much better when you're naked
I like you so much better when you're naked
I like me so much better when you're naked, alright

I won't mind
If you take me home
Come on, take me home

I won't mind
If you take off all your clothes
Come on take 'em off

'Cause I like you so much better when you're naked
I like me so much better when you're naked
I like you so much better when you're naked
I like me so much better when you're naked
