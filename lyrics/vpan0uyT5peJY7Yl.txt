Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty
Knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down
The whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!

Snap back to reality
Oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
He won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's...
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
You better never let it go
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
You better never let it go
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo (You better)

The soul's escaping
Through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring
But superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows he's grown farther
From home, he's known father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner, but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da da da

You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
You better never let it go
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
You better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo (You better)

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the...
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder trying to feed and water my seed plus
Teeter totter, caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on her, too much
For me to wanna stay in one spot
Another day of monotony has gotten me
To the point, I'm like a snail, I've got to formulate a plot
Or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option
Failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
You better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
You better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo (You better)
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
