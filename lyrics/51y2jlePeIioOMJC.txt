That's it,
I've had enough
It's time to get a job
I need money for bills and stuff
It's time to get a
job
It's time to get a job

In exchange for money
you will trade your very soul

That's it
I've had enough
It's time to get a job
I need money for bills and stuff
It's time to get a,
Job
It's time to get a job
