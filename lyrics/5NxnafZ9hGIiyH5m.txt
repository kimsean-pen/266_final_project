September we met
I could tell by your smile
You hadn't been with
A good girl like me in awhile
Yeah, you were impressed
Couldn't leave me alone
Text me everytime
That you pick up the phone
And I had control in the drivers seat
But my hands are slippin' off the wheel
Now the tables have turned, now I'm up all night
I'm picturin' you actin' like a fool
I'm on the other side, you're like a full moon
And I'm up all night, howlin' at you
Tables have turned
Tables have turned
Tables have turned
Tables have turned
I used to be chill
Now I can't catch my breath
When you say my name
I feel tight in my chest
Can't handle the space
I need you here by my side
You make me sweat
In the coldest of nights yah
And I had control in the drivers seat (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But my hands are slippin' off the wheel
Now the tables have turned, now I'm up all night
I'm picturing you actin' like a fool
I'm on the other side, you're like a full moon
And I'm up all night, howlin' at you
Tables have turned
Tables have turned
Tables have turned
Tables have turned
Feels all turned upside down
I guess I'm the needy one now (now)
Feels all turned upside down
I guess I'm the needy one, needy one
Now the tables have turned, now I'm up all night
I'm picturing you actin' like a fool
I'm on the other side, you're like a full moon
And I'm up all night, howlin' at you
Tables have turned
Tables have turned
Tables have turned
Tables have turned
Tables have turned
Tables have turned
