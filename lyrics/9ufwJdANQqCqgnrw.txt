If you want me, the cherry on top
The pick of the pack, the crème de la crop
If you want me you better do better than that tonight, oh, oh

If you want me, it takes more than a wink
More than a drink, more than you think
If you want me, you're gonna have to break the bank tonight (oohh)

'Cause, some don't have the patience
Some call me high maintenance
But you pay the bill, 'cause, that's the deal

If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me, for me
'Cause, I can be bought, but you pay the cost
If you can afford me

If you want me, I'm not a piece of ass
A one night stand, a storage shed
I think you better walk by tonight, oh, no
If you want me, then stop begging
I don't put out for charity
If you want me, there's no discount price tonight (oohh)

But I don't need your dollar bills
I just want something real
'Cause, nothing's free except loving me

If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me, for me
'Cause, I can be bought, but you pay the cost
If you can afford me

If you want me, the cherry on top
The pick of the pack, the crème de la crop

If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me, for me
'Cause, I can be bought, but you pay the cost
If you can afford me

If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me, for me
'Cause, I can be bought, but you pay the cost
If you can afford me
