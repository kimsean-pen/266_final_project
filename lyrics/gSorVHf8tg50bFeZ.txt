I've got your picture
that you gave to me
and its signed with love
just like it used to be
the only thing different
the only thing new
i've got your picture
she's got you
I've got the records that we used to share
and they still sound the same as when you were here
The only thing different
the only thing new
i've got the records
She's got you
I've got your memory, or has it got me.

I really don't know
but I know it won't let me be
I've got your class ring
That proved you cared
It still looks the same as when you gave it dear
the only different
the only thing new
i've got these little things
She's got you
I've got your memory, or has it got me?
I really don't know. But I know it won't let me be
I've got your class ring, that proved you cared
and it still looks the same as when you gave it dear
The only thing different
The only thing new
I've got these little things
She's got you
