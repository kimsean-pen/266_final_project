Once upon a time I knew,
How to make you happy or make you blue,
Guess I'll be the same again,
But it's not that easy to just be friends.

Look at where we are today,
With our pointless efforts to lay the blame,
Maybe things can never work,
After so much betrayal and so much hurt.

We're in the same position,
But a million miles apart,
Maybe things will work eventually,
But I just don't know where to start.

When love has gone away,
Something takes its place,
Does it really have to be hate?

So what's it's gonna be?
It's up to you and me,
I just hope it isn't too late.

Things we say to.
. all the pain,
All it does is get us nowhere,

Yes, maybe in the end,
We can be good friends,
I want to but it isn't easy.

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

So, love has been and gone,
How do we go on?
Is there something still worth saving?

Well, what's it gonna be?
We can wait and see,
Tell me do you think we'll make it?

Let's stop the silly games,
Dishing out the blame,
I know that you feel the same way,

This doesn't have to be,
Such a tragedy,
Everything will work out someday.

Well, maybe in the end,
We can just be friends,
I want to but isn't easy,
Yes, maybe in the end,
We will be good friends,
This is how it really should be.
