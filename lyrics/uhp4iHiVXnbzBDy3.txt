Waiting for the sunlight to grow me through the floor
I'm still waiting for the sunlight to grow me through the floor

We won't go walking and we won't see summertime
We won't imagine that we can't run on

Waiting for the sunlight to grow me through the floor
I'm still waiting for the sunlight to grow me through the floor

We won't go walking and we won't see summertime
We won't imagine that we can't run on
We won't go walking and we won't see summertime
We won't imagine that we can't run on
We won't go walking and we won't see summertime
We won't imagine that we can't run on
