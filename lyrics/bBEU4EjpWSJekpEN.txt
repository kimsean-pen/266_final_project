Previous wars made billionaires out of millionaires
Today's wars make trillionaires out of billionaires
Tomorrows wars will fuel generations of hate
Generations of hate

I'm losing my grip on reality
I cannot simply agree that we are civilized
Acting like this life is infinite
It's a chess board of lies that will generate stalemate
It will generate stalemate

So yes, I've gone to the hills again
So yes, I've gone away

Money is made while bombs are dropping in Afghanistan
And white phosphorous falls in Palestine
Pouring weapons out at a reckless pace
Arming anyone who wants a taste of disgrace
Wants a taste of disgrace

So yes I've gone to the hills again
So yes I've gone away
So yes I've gone to the hills again
So yes I've gone away, hey

Oh, so I've drifted away, I've drifted away in this body
I've drifted, I've drifted, I've drifted away in this body
So yes I've, yes I've gone to the hills again

Oh, so I've drifted away, I've drifted away in this body
I've drifted, I've drifted, I've drifted away in this body
Yes I've, yes I've gone to the hills again
Yes I've, yes I've gone to the hills again

And I'll live out this fantasy
And I'll live out this fantasy
I'll live this fantasy
I'll live this fant

And I'll live out this fantasy
And I'll live out this fantasy
I'll live this fantasy
I'll live this fant

And I'll live out this fantasy
And I'll live out this fantasy
I'll live this fantasy
I'll live this fantasy
