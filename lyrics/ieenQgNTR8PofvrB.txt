時を越えて 解き放て Far Away
走り続け遥か彼方 Run Away
(This time we're taking about to the north)
The wind blows, the wind blows

Fly higher in the sky (Makes us star gazers)
Fly higher in the night (Makes us star gazers)
Starlight, Starlight, 光照らすその先へ
Starlight, Starlight

捜し求め, 駆け抜けて Get Away
記憶の欠片 デジャヴ メジャヴ Fade away
(This time we're taking about to the north)
Dreaming now, Dreaming now

Fly higher in the night (Makes us star gazers)
Fly higher in the sky (Makes us star gazers)
Starlight, Starlight, 光放つあの場所へ
Starlight, Starlight

Wherever we are, we'll be with you
We'll never forget shining starlight
Wherever you are, live in my heart
We'll never forget shooting star
Wherever we are, we'll be with you
We'll never forget shining starlight
Wherever you are, live in my heart
We'll never forget shining star...

Fly higher in the sky
Fly higher in the light
Fly higher in the sky
Starlight shining in the night
