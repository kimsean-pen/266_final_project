While my hands are tied behind my back
You save the best and put me last
I've given up on giving you my heart
I fuckin' hate it
I waited
Think about all the times we faked it
Realize that we tore this place apart

But there's no reply from you
No matter what I do
I'll never get away from you
We're not finished

With my fingers crossed behind my back
I let your words slip through my cracks
This person you perceived is dead and gone
I fuckin' hate it
You're jaded
We can scream for the hell we created
This time I won't let you get me wrong

'Cause there's no reply from you (no reply from you)
No matter what I do
I'll never get away from you
There's just no reply from you (no reply from you)
No matter what I do
I'll never get away from you (I'll never get away)

Oh, you wanna hurt me?
Before I go, you wanna break me down?
But you'll never, hear me
You'll never feel the way I feel (feel the way I feel)
We're not finished here

'Cause there's no reply from you (no reply from you)
No matter what I do
I'll never get away from you (never get away from you)
There's just no reply from you (no reply from you)
No matter what I do
I'll never get away from you
We're not finished here
