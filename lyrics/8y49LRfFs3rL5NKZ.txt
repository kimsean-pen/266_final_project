Hey it's Saara,
I know I should have called but you know how I really feel
You let me be me, I'm just not ready for the world to know... not yet

You, you got me good, you got me bad
You make me run but I keep running back
We're on and off, I'm gone I'm stuck on you

Sometimes it hurts so much
But I still want it, I want it, I want it
I know my heart enough
Let's be honest, be honest, be honest

It's like I'm walking on nails my hands in the fire
Waiting for your lips to make me liar
Making me burn in beautiful pain
Loving you's the same as walking on nails
Wa-a-a-a-wa-a walking on nails
Loving you's the same as walking on nails
Wa-a-a-a-wa-a walking on nails
Loving you's the same as walking on nails

You, you're on my mind, I'm on my back
You bend me up baby but I won't crack
It never stops, I need your touch on me

Sometimes it hurts so much
But I still want it, I want it, I want it
I know my heart enough
Let's be honest, be honest, be honest

It's like I'm walking on nails my hands in the fire
Waiting for your lips to make me liar
Making me burn in beautiful pain
Loving you's the same as walking on nails
Wa-a-a-a-wa-a walking on nails
Loving you's the same as walking on nails
Wa-a-a-a-wa-a walking on nails
Loving you's the same as walking on nails
Wa-a-a-a-wa-a
Loving you's the same as walking on nails
Wa-a-a-a-wa-a walking on nails
Loving you, loving you

It's like I'm walking on nails my hands in the fire
Waiting for your lips to make me liar
Making me burn in beautiful pain
Loving you's the same as walking on nails
Wa-a-a-a-wa-a walking on nails
Waiting for your lips to make me liar
Wa-a-a-a-wa-a walking on nails
Loving you's the same as walking on nails
Wa-a-a-a-wa-a walking on nails
Loving you's the same as walking on nails
