Each day it gets a little worse
Trying so hard to follow my dreams
You know I need life insurance but I can barely pay my rent
I'm a millennial son of a bitch
I'd rather die poor than give in
I'm not lazy, I just don't give a shit about material things

So take a pill to make you smile
And go buy shit you don't need
'Cause don't you know that Jesus Christ loves America?
That's why we're always winning
And don't forget to lock your door
And board up the window pains
'Cause you got to defend yourself
From anyone who doesn't think the same

Fuck yeah, I've always been anxious
'Cause I've always been in debt
And when I was eighteen two planes flew into a fucking building
And we've been at war ever since
We destroyed the environment
Fuck the government, it's an embarrassment
We're all going die in debt

So take a pill to make you smile
And go buy shit you don't need
'Cause don't you know that Jesus Christ loves America?
That's why we're always winning
And don't forget to lock your door
And board up the window pains
'Cause you got to defend yourself
From anyone who doesn't think the same

Forget everything they tell you that you need
It's all in your head, it's all in your heart
Forget everything they tell you that you need
It's all in your head, it's all in your heart
Forget everything they tell you that you need
It's all in your head, it's all in your heart

So take a pill to make you smile
And go buy shit you don't need
'Cause don't you know that Jesus Christ loves America?
That's why we're always winning
And don't forget to lock your door
And board up the window pains
'Cause you got to defend yourself
From anyone who doesn't think the same
(You fucking idiots)
