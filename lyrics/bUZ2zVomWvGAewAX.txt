Oh, what a wonderful thing love is
Oh, I can see you standing there now
And your the prettiest thing in the crowd
And guess who be laughin' loud, but me
You made me see the love that you're givin' me

Baby, won't you hold my hand?
Now, that kinda makes a fool understand
Just let me know that I'm your man
And show I'm not ashamed
I walk the floor when you leave me

Hey baby, I don't know 'bout you
But let me tell what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna try to make my dreams come true
With you
With you, baby

Yeah, I wanna say
I been cryin' without your love
The night time find me
Wetting my pillow, but I

Yeah, I don't
I don't mind, no, but if you
You just let me say it again, I've been cryin'
I wish our trouble would leave me alone
But I've been cryin'

Oh, come on and stop the rain right now
Yeah, stop the rain, stop the rain, stop the rain
Yeah, yeahyeah, Baby
Yeah
Oh, what a wonderful thing love is
