Dust...

I was carried on a wolf's back
To corrupt humanity
I will pummel it with opulence
With corpulence and greed

In God you trust
My mummy dust
Dust
My mummy dust

Your cavalier of crapulence
To this feast of rapacity
I'll murder you in treasures
Just to feed your incapacity

In God you trust
My mummy dust
Dust
My mummy dust

In God you trust
My mummy dust
Dust
My mummy dust

Dust...

You're the possessee of avarice
I'm the ruler of the earth
I will smother you in riches
Till you choke on sordid mirth

You are surrounded in cupidity
From purulence and lust
I'm the magnet for stupidity
And divine you feel my thrust

In God you trust
My mummy dust
Dust
My mummy dust

In God you trust
My mummy dust
Dust

In God we trust
My mummy dust

In God we trust
My mummy dust

In God we trust
My mummy dust
