I wanna walk with you when someone cheers
From somebody else's point of view
It looks like I'm changing

I wanna be the star without the skies
We'll be running, running, running with the same old crowd
And I'll be myself

And I can't begin to tell you
He says, if there's money on your mind
And the drugs don't work
As you'll be lying on your own
You won't know where you stand

I'm a selfish man in a selfish world
There's a world we choose and a friend we lose
It looks like I'm changing

I've been told to sit down when I just stand up
It wouldn't mean that much just to hear me say
That I've been myself
I'm all of yourself

And I can't begin to tell you
He says, if there's money on your mind
And the drugs don't work
As you'll be lying on your own
You won't know where you stand

And I can't begin to tell you
He says, if there's money on your mind
And the drugs don't work
As you'll be lying on your own
You won't know where you stand
