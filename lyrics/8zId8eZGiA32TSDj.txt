Tell me now if you came sneaking up behind
Would you know me and see behind the smile
I can change like colors on a wall
Hoping no one else will find the lies beneath it all
I think I had it all so well
Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can't erase in my life
Everybody knows
Standing out, so you won't forget my name
That's the way we play this game of life
Everybody knows
Looking through the crowd
Search for someone else
Every time I turn around
I run into myself
Here I stand
Consumed of my surroundings
Just another day
Of everybody looking
Swore they'd never see me cry
Never see me cry
Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can't erase in my life
Everybody knows
Standing out, so you won't forget my name
That's the way we play this game of life
Everybody knows
Say I'll pay the price
There's a chance that I'll take it
Though you may think I'm telling lies
I'm just gonna get it by
Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can't erase in my life
Everybody knows
Standing out, so you won't forget my name
That's the way we play this game of life
Everybody knows
Everybody knows
Everybody knows
I'm just barely getting by
Everybody knows
I'm just barely getting by
Everybody knows
I'm just barely getting by
Everybody knows
I'm just barely getting by
Everybody knows
Everybody knows
