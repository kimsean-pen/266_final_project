Take me to the night
I'm tippin' topsy turvy turning upside down
Hold me tight and whisper what you wish
For there is no one here around
Oh you may sing song me sweet smiles
Regardless of the city's careless frown
Come watch the no colors fade blazing
Into pedal sprays of violets of dawn
In blindfold wonderments enchantments
You can lift my wings softly to fly
Your eyes are like swift fingers reaching out
Into the pockets of my night
Whirling twirling puppy warm
Before the flashing cloaks of darkness gone
Come see the no colors fade blazing
Into pedal sprays of violets of dawn
Some prince charming I'll be
On two white steeds to bring you diamond crowns
And climb your tower sleeping beauty
Before you ever know I've left the ground
You can wear a Cinderella Snowhite
Alice Wonderland gown
Come watch the no colors fade blazing
Into pedal sprays of violets of dawn
But if I seem to wander off in dream like looks
Please let me settle slowly
It's only me just staring out at you
A seeming stranger speaking holy
I don't mean to wake you up
It's only loneliness just coming on
So let the no colors fade
Blazing into petal sprays
Of violets of dawn
Like shadows bursting into mist
Behind the echoes of this nonsense song
It's just chacing whispering trail
Of secret steps see them laughing on
There's magic in the sleepiness
Of waking to a childish sounding yawn
Come watch the no colors fade blazing
Into pedal sprays of violets of dawn
