I've been twisting and turning
In a space that's too small
I've been drawing the line and watching it fall
You've been closing me in, closing the space in my heart
Watching us fading and watching it all fall apart

Well I can't explain why it's not enough, 'cause I gave it all to you
And if you leave me now, oh just leave me now
It's the better thing to do
It's time to surrender, it's been too long pretending
There's no use in trying, when the pieces don't fit anymore
The pieces don't fit here anymore

You pulled me under
I had to give in
Such a beautiful myth
That's breaking my skin
Well I'll hide all the bruises
I'll hide all the damage that's done
But I'll show how I'm feeling until all the feeling has gone

Well I can't explain why it's not enough, 'cause I gave it all to you
And if you leave me now, oh just leave me now
It's the better thing to do
It's time to surrender, it's been too long pretending
There's no use in trying, when the pieces don't fit anymore
The pieces don't fit here anymore

Oh don't misunderstand
How I feel
'Cause I've tried, yes I've tried
But still I don't know why, no I don't know why
I don't know why... why

Well I can't explain why it's not enough, I gave it all to you
And if you leave me now, just leave me now
It's the better thing to do
Well it's time to surrender, it's been too long pretending
There's no use in trying, when the pieces don't fit anymore
The pieces don't fit here anymore

The pieces don't fit anymore
