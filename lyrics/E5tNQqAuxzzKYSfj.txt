Out of sight
I'll be forgiven
In the forefront
I'm forced to break away

I'm trying to be someone
But I don't even know what that means
And I'm trying to do something
But I don't even know what that is

How cold must you be
To do the things you do
Out of sight?

Out of sight
I'll keep you satisfied
In the dark we speak in tongue

I'm trying to get started
But I can't find a man on the run
And I'm trying to get going
But I already see that I'm done

How low must you stoop
To bow before the throne?

On your own
Out of sight
On your own
Out of sight

She had me
Run run run run run run run run run run run run running away
Can't catch me
Run run run run run run run run run run run run running away
Gotta keep on
Run run run run run run run run run run run run running away
Gotta keep on
Run run run run run run run run run run run run running away
