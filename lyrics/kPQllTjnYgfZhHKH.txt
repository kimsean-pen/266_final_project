If we could live in this moment
And just hold it
Keep my head on your chest
I'll never leave this bed
The flowers will be blooming
The leaves will be turning
And snow will be falling
While we're making love

And the sun will be shining
The flowers still are blooming
Then leaves will turn again
But time will be frozen for us (ha, ha)
Time will be frozen for us (ha, ha)
Time will be frozen for us

Cover the window and come uncover me
Let's forget the world even exists
Cause nothing compares to this
The flowers will be blooming
The leaves will be turning
And snow will be falling
While we're making love

And the sun will be shining
The flowers still are blooming
Then leaves will turn again
But time will be frozen for us (ha, ha)
Time will be frozen for us (ha, ha)
Time will be frozen for us

The flowers will be blooming
The leaves will be turning
And snow will be falling
While we're making love
And the sun will be shining
The flowers still are blooming
Then leaves will turn again
But time will be frozen for us (ha, ha)
Time will be... (ha, ha)
Time will be frozen for us
