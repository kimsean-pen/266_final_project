I cannot erase it, the cut is deep
But I can let it go
I cannot undo it, but dare a leap
'Cause love is all around me

I chased the pain, no glory
Prepared to crucify myself
A pale and painful story
In moments of despair

A shattered voice that whispers
A wandering soul that fades away
Sometimes it seems I've vanished
But I am here to stay

Did I find my way out of the dark

All is written in blood, I'm buried alive
Down on my knees, I'm begging you please
Take me away, wherever you go
Something has counterfeit my soul

Don't leave me alone, out in the cold
I'm all for by myself, in a cage of gloom
I failed to succeed, to live my life
Please come and purify me, purify me

Quivering and chill, my being
Willing to suffer in my grief
I was carving my skin to deep
Forever to be seen

Each cut was a little deeper
But I found no bliss in what I did
A fragile soul is easy broken
And demise easy sealed

Did I find my way out of the dark

All is written in blood, I'm buried alive
Down on my knees, I'm begging you please
Take me away, wherever you go
Something has counterfeit my soul

Don't leave me alone, out in the cold
I'm all for by myself, in a cage of gloom
I failed to succeed, to live my life
Please come and purify me, purify me

Is there a land over the rainbow
And in the end a paradise
Is there a moral to the story
Or is it just another lie

All is written in blood, I'm buried alive
Down on my knees, I'm begging you please
Take me away, wherever you go
Something has counterfeit my soul

Don't leave me alone, out in the cold
I'm all for by myself, in a cage of gloom
I failed to succeed, to live my life
Please come and purify me, purify me
