I was waiting so long, forgot what I was waiting for
I was waiting so long, forgot what I was waiting for
Now I'm feeling lots of feeling
I don't wanna feel no more
I was waiting so long
I was waiting so long

But I want it right now
Or I don't want it at all
No waiting in my place if I can't have it all the way
I want it all, I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
I want it all

I was waiting so long, forgot what I was waiting for
I was waiting so long, forgot what I was waiting for
Now I'm feeling lots of feeling
I don't wanna feel no more
I was waiting so long
I was waiting so long

But I want it right now
Or I don't want it at all
No waiting in my place if I can't have it all the way
I want it all, I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
I want it all

If you see the kingdom call
Tell me what you think about when our days are done
'Cause I'm not done, don't tell me it's too late
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
I want it all
I don't wanna wait
