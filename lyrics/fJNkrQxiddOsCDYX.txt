She's going out to forget they were together
All that time he was taking her for granted
She wants to see if there's more
Than he gave she's looking for
He calls her up
He's trippin' on the phone now
He doesn't want her out there
And alone now
He knows she's movin' it
Knows she's using it
Now he's losing it, she don't care

Everybody put up your hands
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Feel the beat now
If you've got nothing left
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Back it up now

You've got a reason to live
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Feelin' good now
Don't be afraid to get down
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love

He was always giving her attention
Looking hard to find the things she mentioned
He was dedicated but most suckers hate it

That girl was fine but she didn't appreciate him
She calls him up
She's trippin' on the phone now
He had to get up
And he ain't comin' home now
He's tryin' to forget her
That's how we come with him
When he first met her
When they first got together

Everybody put up your hands
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Feel the beat now
If you got nothing left
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love

Back it up now
You got a reason to live
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Feelin' good now
Don't be afraid to get down
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
To the beat, to the beat, to the beat
You got nothing to lose
Don't be afraid to get down
We break up, it's something that we do now

Everyone has got to do it sometime
It's okay, let it go
Get out there and find someone
It's too late to be trippin' on the phone here
Get off the wire, know everything is good here
Stop what you're doin', you don't wanna ruin
The chance that you got to find a new one

Everybody put up your hands
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Feel the beat now
If you got nothing left
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love

Back it up now
You got a reason to live
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Feelin' good now
Don't be afraid to get down
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
No, no
Now you know what to do
So come on, get up, girl
