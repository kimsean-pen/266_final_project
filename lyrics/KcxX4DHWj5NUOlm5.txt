Paralyzed from the neck down.
Can't move, can't scream, can't make a fucking sound.
The shadows move and enclose the room,
creating the familiar silhouettes that
stalk and linger throughout the nights.
Wake up.
Teasing, they aim to mangle your perception of reality.
Staring back at you, making sure you see and feel their presence.
Numb from fear,
they reach over and hover above to
remind you what you've always been told.
You'll never get rid of them and your life is a lost soul.
Wake up
I'll never sleep again.
I'll never be the same.
I'm crawling out of my own skin, I'm drowning in pain.
They watch, they wait,
they accumulate incontestably through the dying
light, to fulfill my miserable construct, my every night
I am imprisoned to the shadows of a different realm.
Realize that this is hell
I am imprisoned to the shadows of a different realm.
This is the darkest form of mental torture, this is hell.
My body is numb,
only my eyes can move and witness the hateful
energy that stares back into the depths of me
Paralyzed paranormal paralysis Preying on perception and wretchedness
I am the hopeless
I am one with the night
Take me
I'll never sleep again.
I'll never be the same.
I'm crawling out of my own skin, I'm drowning in pain.
They watch, they wait,
they accumulate incontestably through the dying
light, to fulfill my miserable construct, my every night
I am imprisoned to the shadows of a different realm.
Realize that this is hell
