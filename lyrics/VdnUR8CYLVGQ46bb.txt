Sin in my heart
Sin in my heart
Sin in my heart
Sin in my heart
Sin in my heart flying like a dart
Oh sin in my heart
It's beginning to start
It's beginning to start
It's beginning to start
When you're lying like a tart
Oh sin in my heart
When you grovel at my feet
Oh sin in my heart
It's short and sweet, oh
Oh oh oh
Sin in my heart
Sin in my heart
Sin in my heart
Sin in my heart
Oh, swift as a dart sin in my heart
Oh sin in my heart
When you grovel at my feet
Keep it short and sweet
Oh sin in my heart
Sin in my heart
Sin in my heart
Sin in my heart, oh
Oh oh oh
