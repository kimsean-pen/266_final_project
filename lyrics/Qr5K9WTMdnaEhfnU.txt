Have you ever stared into the rain
Thought the clouds would never disappear?
Have you ever screamed out in the dark
Thinking no one else could hear?

I was leaving footprints tainted by my past
On this winding road to you

I'd lost my faith in love
Tonight I believe again
My heart was a broken place
And now I feel whole again

And you bring me honesty
And that's worth believing in
And I believe, I believe again

Have you ever spun out of control
Like you never saw the road ahead?
Have you ever just kept looking back
Ever closer to the edge?

I was praying for the light I see in your eyes
I had all but given up

I'd lost my faith in love
Tonight I believe again
My heart was a broken place
And now I feel whole again

And you bring me honesty
And that's worth believing in
And I believe, I believe again

I believe the impossible
Is possible to overcome
I believe in the miracles
Born from love in everyone

I believe the impossible
Is possible to overcome
I believe in the miracles
Born from love in everyone

I believe the impossible
Is possible to overcome
I believe in the miracles
Born from love in everyone

I believe the impossible
Is possible to overcome
I believe in the miracles
Born from love in everyone

I'd lost my faith in love
Tonight I believe again
My heart was a broken place
And now I feel whole again

And you bring me honesty
And that's worth believing in
And I believe
And I believe, I believe again
