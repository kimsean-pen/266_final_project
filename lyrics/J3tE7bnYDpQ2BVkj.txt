All my visions of sweet tomorrow
It's cracking and fading away
Hopes of glory are drowned in sorrow
This distension expels us to the yesterday

Leave the truth to your lust of pride
They fight so brave a heart
Or cast the oak of Endiaside
And keep the land from falling apart

Do you hear the clarion call
It's calling out to one and all
Who will live and who will fall
Who will walk the golden hall
Do you hear the clarion call
It's calling out to one and all
Who is right and who is wrong
Whose side is god really on

What are the alliances and treaties for
As pretenders haven't look to the sky
All the trumpets will sounds once more
And victory will be given another try

Do you hear the clarion call
It's calling out to one and all
Who will live and who will fall
Who will walk the golden hall
Do you hear the clarion call
It's calling out to one and all
Our blood must be spilled
So the nobles' visions

Can be fulfilled
The Knight harvests our land
While the good citizens reach for their dreams
The nation split by force hands

While their pride slowly vaporise
Into a steam that escapes their eyes
A fool is he who can not foresee
Hell is what this our land will be
Yes, hell is what this our land will be

Do you hear the clarion call
It's calling out to one and all
Who will live and who will fall
Who will walk the golden hall
Do you hear the clarion call
It's calling out to one and all
Who is right and who is wrong
Whose side is god really on

Do you hear the clarion call
It's calling out to one and all
Who will live and who will fall
Who will walk the golden hall
Do you hear the clarion call
It's calling out to one and all
Which side will finally prevail
While the other side will fail

How many pretenders can we endure
The land is bleeding so not many more
Who may better the royal swept a sway
Questions, questions
You'll see at the end of the day
