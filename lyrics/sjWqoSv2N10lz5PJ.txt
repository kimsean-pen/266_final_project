sometimes i know it isnt right to wake you up coming home at night
but it isnt easy keeping up with the deep friends chemicals and candy
dont know what they do to me but i know ive got a soul
to come home to youre up baking bread,
im still sleeping dont know what i did
is it deceiving

i know i keep you lonely
it all just means too much to me dont know why i build them up those
situations
im coming home now
im coming home now
sleep easy
sleep easy
im coming home now
im coming home now
sleep easy sleep easy
youre dancing through the day whatever takes your pain away im living
through the fray do you believe me
i know i keep you lonely
it all just means too much to me dont know why i build them up those
situations
im coming home now
im coming home now
sleep easy sleep easy
