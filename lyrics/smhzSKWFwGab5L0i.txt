I was never really into music
'Til I was about nine years old
Now I can't control myself from groovin'
It is time for me to show

'Cause today oh
I'll show ya
I'll blow ya mind
Oh, let's hear the vibe go crazy
The vibe go crazy

I was always on the run I tell ya, it was not an easy road
But now I'm ready to bring joy and
fire, the best things in life, for sure
I do know what it's like to feel sad all the time
But, you see, wicked vibes bring that joy in your life

'Cause today oh
I'll show ya
I'll blow ya mind
Oh, let's hear the vibe go crazy
The vibe go crazy

'Cause today oh
I'll show ya
I'll blow ya mind
Oh, let's hear the VIbe go crazy
The vibe go crazy

The rhythm is magic, and it gets me up, again and again
I feel like I'm flying, it lifts me up, again and again
Do you know what it can do to you Crazy vibes
You must know what it can do to you, Crazy vibes

'Cause today oh
I'll show ya
I'll blow ya mind
Oh until the vibes go crazy
The vibes go crazy

'Cause today oh
