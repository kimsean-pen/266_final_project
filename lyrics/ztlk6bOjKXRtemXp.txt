Roll the bones and dice
A pagan sacrificed
A fleeting state of mind
My hair begins to rise
I pay my demons price
The tree was shaken thrice
The spell was dealt the crone
The knuckle and the stone
(chorus;)
The blood on my clothes
My family's demise
A cryptid wolf lunatic
The witch and the christ
She's traded the root of me
For carnivorous eyes
The baffling truth of it
The witch and the christ
The bloody pentecost
The true belief is lost
Lurker in darkest forests
The thirst for blood is quenched
(repeat 1st verse)
