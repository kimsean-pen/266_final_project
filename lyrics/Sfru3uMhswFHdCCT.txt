Threatening and cold
A poem from the underworld
Where shadows walk
Beyond redemption

Dante's Inferno
Dante's Inferno

Minos wraps his serpent
Tail around himself
To mark a sinner's level
His prison cell.
The famous poet Dante
Is passing through the gates
The only living being
In this accursed place.

Threatening and cold
A poem from the underworld
Where shadows walk
Beyond redemption

Dante's Inferno
Dante's Inferno

The greedy pay the price
Their wealth is cursed
The wrathful fight each other
Covered with slimy mud
The flames are burning heretics
And for the violent ones
Red blood is boiling.
As thieves will turn to vipers
And vipers will turn to thieves

Ninth, the lower plain.
Who could ever guess?
It is a frozen lake!
An angel in his past, a fallen one
Right on the spot he crashed
For aeons is lying down...
