What am I doing with my life?
I feel like I should be hitting some kind of mark
The man, the house, the car
But it all feels kinda off

Outside, walking the streets at night
Trying to get these fears out of my mind
You don't know what it's like
Trying to please a million people all the time

I've always done exactly what I'm told
But that ain't gonna work for me no more

I blame it on society
Trying to tell me who I'm supposed to be
Why they always got to put these clothes on me?
The ones that care the most, well, they ain't even close to me

I blame it on society
I need a break from this anxiety
I just want someone to love me quietly
For who I'm for real and not for who I try to be

I blame it on society

Sitting in a lukewarm bath, blowing bubbles
Stinking rays of thoughts
My body's aching, I'm all alone
I call you up and I cry for home

But what is home anymore
What is this life we're looking for?
I feel I want to make it known
But I might disappoint you
And I'm sorry if I do

I've always done exactly what I'm told
But that ain't gonna work for me no more

I blame it on society
Trying to tell me who I'm supposed to be
Why they always got to put these clothes on me?
The ones that care the most, well they ain't even close to me

I blame it on...

I've always done exactly what I'm told
But that ain't gonna work for me no more

I blame it on society
Trying to tell me who I'm supposed to be
Why they always got to put these clothes on me?
The ones that care the most, well they ain't even close to me

I blame it on society
I need a break from this anxiety
I just want someone to love me quietly
For who I'm for real and not for who I try to be

I blame it on society
