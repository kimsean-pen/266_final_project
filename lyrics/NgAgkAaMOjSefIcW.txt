Oh, if you only knew
What we've been up to
I guarantee you'd keep it secret

So give it to me now
We're lost in a dream now
Do it (five, four, three, two) one more time

In the Vegas lights
Where villains spend the weekend
The deep end
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown

The Vegas lights
The lies and affectations
Sensation
We're winning 'till the curtain's coming down

Ain't it so, ain't it so perfect?
Our cynical minds will make it totally worth it

So give it to me now
We're lost in a dream now
Do it (five, four, three, two) one more time

In the Vegas lights
Where villains spend the weekend
The deep end
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown

The Vegas lights
The lies and affectations
Sensation
We're winning 'till the curtain's coming down

Woah
(Five, four, three, two, one)
Woah

Woah
(Five, four, three, two, one)
Woah

And we're all not here for nothing
And we're bored with looking good
We gotta be starting something

Would you change it if you could?
Would you change it if you could?
Would you change it if you could?
Would you change it if you could?

In the Vegas lights
Where villains spend the weekend
The deep end
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown

The Vegas lights
The lies and affectations
Sensation
We're winning 'till the curtain's coming down
