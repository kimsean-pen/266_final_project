Lies that I told ya
Lies that I told ya
Answers I owe ya
Answers I owe ya

See you run into the night
Runnin' like a streaming light
I see you fade into the blue
But babe I love to watch you move

In the end, there's nothing I can do
(You, you, you, you)
In the end, it's always you
(You, you, you, you)

Waves that are broken
Words unspoken to you
This guitar plays forever
When it's playing for you

Feel you drift away from me
Till there's nothin' I can see
See you fade into the black
But babe I love to watch your back

In the end, there's nothing I can do
(You, you, you, you)
In the end, it's always you
(You, you, you, you)
(You, you, you, you)
