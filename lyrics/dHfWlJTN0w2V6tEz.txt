Hey

Whenever I step outside
Somebody claims to see the light
It seems to me that all of us have lost our patience

'Cause everyone thinks they're right
And nobody thinks that there just might
Be more than one road to our final destination

But I'm not ever going to know
If I'm right or wrong
'Cause we're all going in the same direction

And I'm not sure which way to go
Because all along
We've been going in the same direction

I'm tired of playing games
Of looking for someone else to blame
For all the holes in answers that are clearly showing

For something to fill the space
Was all of the time I spent a waste
'Cause so many choices point the same way I was going?

But I'm not ever going to know
If I'm right or wrong
'Cause we're all going in the same direction

And I'm not sure which way to go
Because all along
We've been going in the same direction

Going in the same direction
Same direction
(Same direction)

So why does there only have to be
One correct philosophy?
I don't want to go and follow you
Just to end up like one of them

And why are you always telling me
What you want me to believe?
I'd like to think that I can go my own way
And meet you in the end
Go my own way and meet you in the end

I'm not ever gonna know
If I'm right or wrong
'Cause we're all going in the same direction

And I'm not sure which way to go
Because all along
We've been going in the same direction

Going in the same direction
Going in the same direction
Same direction (same direction)
