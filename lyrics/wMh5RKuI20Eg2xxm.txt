Done, done is all the love, love that I had saved for you
Gone, gone with my heart, locked inside a cage for you
And once this that has become, has become of poor old me
Tried, so hard to believe in something that will never be, never be

Believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe

All, all that I could give, all I had to offer her
Is gone, simply locked away, no longer there to bother her
Now look, look at what's become, what's become of poor old me
Tried, so hard to believe in something that will never be, never be

Believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe
Feeling so confused
You don't know what to do
Afraid she might not love you
Anymore

And though she says she does
And hasn't lost your trust

Who could that be
Knocking at her door?

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves

The feeling never stops
And neither does the clock
Wishing for tomorrow
Today

She still said she's true
So you start coming, too
Just as that old knocking
Comes to stay

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
