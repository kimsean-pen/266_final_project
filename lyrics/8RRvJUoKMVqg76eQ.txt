Sugar smile savvy, the king of the kerb
Got a temper in the style of a bomb
Got his friends in his pocket or safe behind bars
All the local boys know what he? s done

He turns it on
He turns it on
He turns it on

Same boys doin' it for themselves
There? s somebody out there doin' it for you
Safe white, you? re paying out for your health
They? re the kings of the kerb
And everybody knows what they? re worth

Sugar smile savvy, the king of the kerb
Keeps the order in this part of the town
All the shadows in the alley, the shapes at the bar
Like to service him when he does the round

He turns it on
He turns it on
He turns it on

Same boys doin' it for themselves
There? s somebody out there doin' it for you
Safe white, you? re paying out for your health
They? re the kings of the kerb
And everybody knows what they? re worth

Safe from home and safe from greed
A little protection is all that you need
Safe from home and safe from greed
They? re just a rocket machine

Same boys doin' it for themselves
There? s somebody out there doin' it for you
Same boys doin' it for themselves
There? s somebody out there doing it for you

Same boys doin' it for themselves
There? s somebody out there lookin' it for you
Safe white, you? re paying out for your health
They? re the kings of the kerb

They? re the kings of the kerb
They? re the kings of the kerb
And everybody knows what they? re worth
