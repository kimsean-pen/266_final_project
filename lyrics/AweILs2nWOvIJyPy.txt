Gods
Flesh is hanging in sun
Purple sky and this war
Women shooting their guns
Men protecting their shores
Running red as these ships
Made for cargo and death
Is a taste on the lips
Kissing any ground left
To the sky with them all
Not a one left on land
Traded in for steel hauls
And they singing like:

True believer, that I know when I'm goin' home
True believer, that I know when I'm goin' home
True believer, that I know when I'm goin' home
I've been afraid

Three siblings have been to the gods
And they fight as siblings do
The world was only water then
The universe was fresh and new
And [?] poisoned [?] food
Once just to see what he would do
He vomited the sun which dried
The water leaving land and soon
After came moon
And stars and animal
And man of many hues
The white one in the image of
A sickly god
Would get his dues

True believer, that I know when I'm goin' home
True believer, that I know when I'm goin' home
True believer, that I know when I'm goin' home
I've been afraid

Man walks moon
And he makes time come to a standstill
One gloved hand
Diamonds are flickering like candles
This one slip
Registered worlds away
In vandals
Raised to find
This race of beings that could handle
Time inside other bodies
So they could sell it
The one thing
In the universe
No one held yet
Gifts in blood that had been shed as long as time had
Time and he are inseparable in his mind, sad
He must carry the burden of being the one
That time chose
Situates him in front of the gun
Talk that talk
Stay outta the head and become the best
Then times stops
And finally there he be, rest

True believer, that I know when I'm goin' home
True believer, that I know when I'm goin' home
True believer, that I know when I'm goin' home
I've been afraid
