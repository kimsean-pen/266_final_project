Stupid

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me pick up with sign get park
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me pick up with sign get park
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just

I got the big beat
I hear the sound
I got the big beat
I get on down

I've heard the gossip from the street to the slammer
They're tryin' to see if Dizzee stays true to his grammer
Being a celebrity don't mean shit to me
Fuck the glitz and glamour, hey I'm with the blicks and gamma

Because they're talking 'bout rushin'
Talk behind my back but to my face they say nothin'
Stand up in the parks, keep a firm, steady stance
Keep the beanies touchin', keep the beanies hot flushin'

Flushin' M.Cs down the loo
If you don't believe me bring your posse, bring your crew
Feel free to hate 'coz I ain't tryin' to be your mate
Be serious you would'nt last a hour in my shoe

It's an Air-Force-One
Trainers by the truck load, trainers by the tonne
Don't be dazed when I catch you by your J's
Chump, best to act like Forest Gump, best to run

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me pick up with sign get park
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me pick up with sign get park
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just

I got the big beat
I hear the sound
I got the big beat
I get on down

I stay sweet as a nut, sweet like Tropicana
When the hammer hits, your head splits like banana
You're not ready for this girl
You better send your best soldiers, 'coz this is Captain Rosco

More destructive and troublesome than ever
I'll probably be doing this, probably forever
Fellas wanna stop me, they'll probably come together
It's probable they'll stop me, probably never

You top-boy, top-man, or toppa toppa
Come to me with an attitude, come a copper
I'm old school like happy shopper
I fight old school, bring your bat and your chopper

And a first aid kit and some antiseptic
This could get hectic
I'm a done accept it, you got a bright future
Dont let my wrath affect it

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me pick up with sign get park
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just

Fix up look sharp
Don't make me pick up with sign get park
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just

I got the big beat
I hear the sound
I got the big beat
I get on down

Fix up
