I'm not okay
With the distance that's been growin girl, I'm not okay
I love you never show it
And I'm not afraid
Of the future what it's holdin
Girl I'm not afraid
Let me shut my eyes I'm zonin
Turn the radio down
And lay you down too
I could be the one for you
Turn the radio down
And lay you down too
I could be the one for you

I know we're not in love
Love is vivid
No we're not in love
You fall right in it for a week a month or maybe just a minute or a lifetime
What's the difference big bang or collision love is blind

We had a vision though
Now we dead roses
We had a vision though
Now we dead roses

I'm not okay
With the distance that's been growin girl, I'm not okay
I love you never show it
And I'm not afraid
Of the future what it's holdin
Girl I'm not afraid
Let me shut my eyes I'm zonin
Turn the radio down
And lay you down too
I could be the one for you
Turn the radio down
And lay you down too
I could be the one for you

I know we're not in love
Love is vivid
No we're not in love
You fall right in it for a week a month or maybe just a minute or a lifetime
What's the difference big bang or collision love is blind

We had a vision though
Now we dead roses
We had a vision though
Now we dead roses

I'm not okay
With the distance that's been growin girl, I'm not okay
I love you never show it
And I'm not afraid
Of the future what it's holdin
Girl I'm not afraid
Now why did she send them
These broken down, wilted, beat up, rotten looking flowers
You know she actually called a florist and did the whole thing
And had them send, she must have had them send
Send a dead, a dozen dead roses
