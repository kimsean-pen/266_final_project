Meme machine
I'm a motherfucking meme machine
Meme machine
Meme machine
Without memes, I will die

Give me the memes
I need the memes
I smell the memes
I need all the memes, the memes to survive
I need the memes
I breathe the memes
I smell the memes
I need all the memes, the memes to survive

They call me the meme machine
I catch the memes, I spread the memes
I eat the memes, I shit the memes
Without memes, I will die
Inhale the memes
Exhale the memes
Inject the memes into my bloodstream
There are good memes, and there are bad memes
Why has God abandoned us? (Help me)
Smoke the memes, snort the memes
Take the memes until you OD
If you borrowed my memes then you owe me
A new fresh pair of memes

I'm a motherfucking meme machine
Meme machine
Meme machine
Without memes, I will die

Give me the memes
I need the memes
I smell the memes
I need all the memes, the memes to survive
I need the memes
I breathe the memes
I smell the memes
I need all the memes, the memes to survive
