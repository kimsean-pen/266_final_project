I'll linger here
Your ring upon my finger, dear
And sing till dawn
A song of you and me and what and why

For time is all
I have to keep
Between these walls
And half asleep

The days go by
A million little nights
And days go by
And I don't mind
Parades go by
So many beautiful parades go by
Leave me behind

I'll sit and stare
How could I venture anywhere?
And let the centuries fall where they may
But never die

For I have loved
And so I lost
The world above
Beyond the moss

The days go by
A million little nights
And days go by
And I don't mind
Parades go by
So many beautiful parades go by
Leave me behind

The days goes by
(Goes by)
Parades go by
And I don't mind
Parades go by
(Parades go by)
Parades go by
Leave me behind
