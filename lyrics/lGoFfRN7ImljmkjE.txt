For tonight it's just the two of us
Dim the light now just the two of us
Like how you roll whisper in my ear
Your breath like ghosts that disappear

Hold me close
Hold me close
Hold me tight now
Need you more
Want you most
Feels so right now
Like how your hands feel me up and down
Like how your touch send me off the ground

Spread my wings out in to the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart

ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart

Baby can't believe you were sent to me
Like a postcard for my memory
Your body feels like a fantasy
This moment's all that i can see

Pull me close
Strip me down
Hold me tight now
Need you more
Want you most
Feels so right now

Like how your hands never let me down
Like how your touch send me off the ground

Spread my wings out in to the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart

ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart

Trip to your eyes
Trip to your arms
Trip to your kiss
Trip to your lips
Trip to your tongue
Trip to your voice
Trip to your dark
Trip to your heart

Trip to your head
Trip to your chest
Trip to your breath
Trip to your skin
Trip to your sin
Trip to your touch
Trip to your tears
Trip to your heart

Spread my wings out in to the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart

ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
