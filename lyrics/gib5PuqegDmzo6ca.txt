You know it when you see it
You know it when it's there
Like Michael Jackson Thriller
Like Farrah Fawcett Hair
It's good shit
It's good shit
It's good shit
Oh yeah

Solar Energy
Nutella
Democracy
My voice
Enjoying ceviche in Peru and seeing a double rainbow
While listening to Bitches Brew as recorded by Miles Davis

Andre 3000

Full length mirrors and her hair in a bun
Kids with big glasses that laugh when they run
Girls with old-school names like Ruby May
How infants with baby breath, yawn in your face (oh yeah)
You'll be tucked in every night for a month
By all of the American Apparel ad girls
American... American Apparel, and ad girls
You know what I mean?

I like it when you're under the ocean and all you can feel is calm
I like it when I'm sleeping
I like it when I'm listening to music because that's the only thing that takes me to another world
I like it when public bathrooms have scented candles
I like it when you talk to me like that
I like it when my hair is fluffy
I like it when it rains at night and I'm curled up in bed with a good book
I like it when I turn my head around and I catch you looking back

You know it when you see it
You know it when it's there
Like Michael Jackson Thriller
Like Farrah Fawcett Hair
It's good shit (I like it when you play with my hair)
It's good shit (I like it when you play with my hair)
It's good shit (I like it when you play with my hair)
Oh yeah

You know it when you see it
You know it when it's there
Like Michael Jackson Thriller
Like Farrah Fawcett Hair
It's good shit
It's good shit (Oh, it's good shit baby)
It's good shit
Oh yeah
