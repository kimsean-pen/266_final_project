We are the chosen ones, we sacrifice our blood
We kill for honor
We are the holy ones, our armors stained with blood
We killed the dragon
In glory we return, our destination's end
We slayed the dragon
No more living in fear it's time to raise our king.
We made it happen we're the chosen ones!

We are the chosen ones, we sacrifice our blood
We kill for honor
We are the holy ones, our armors stained with blood
We killed the dragon
We're the chosen ones!

Riding through thunder and lighting once again
We slayed the beast we brought an end
Now we have left the kingdom of the damned
Heroes of the day, legends forever!

We are the chosen ones, we sacrifice our blood
We kill for honor
We are the holy ones, our armors stained with blood
We killed the dragon
We're the chosen ones!

It seems to me like a journey without end
So many years, too many battles
We've finally arrived, now we're standing at the gates
Heroes of the day, legends forever!

In glory we return, our destinations end
We slayed the dragon
No more living in fear, it's time to raise our king
We made it happen
We're the chosen ones!

We are the chosen ones, we sacrifice our blood
We kill for honor
We are the holy ones, our armors stained with blood
We killed the dragon
In glory we return, our destinations end
We slayed the dragon
No more living in fear, it's time to raise our king
We made it happen
We're the chosen ones!
We are the chosen ones, we sacrifice our blood
We kill for honor
We are the holy ones, our armors stained with blood
We killed the dragon
In glory we return, our destination's end
We slayed the dragon
No more living in fear it's time to raise our king.
