By the eyes of the very young
It's a sudden good attack
Born of the weakness my oys and I
Carry anger forth and back
But we'll make it somehow
You've all what's mine
And your leading me now

On the gallop to mother's few
We will lose our breath and fight
And you give me the look of thorns
We get liars every night
But I get you somehow
Leave the reins inside
'Cause your leading me now

Every time we wonder
What we left back in your heart
Could you see we're dreaming
Though our minds just fall apart

To the side where I flew from you
When your pace just scared me blind
We would come back and joke of days
When I sold you to the unkind
We will end up somehow
With a peaceful mind
And you're leading me now

And every time we wonder
What we left back in your heart
Could you see we're dreaming
Though our minds just fall apart
But we will end up somehow
With a peaceful mind
And you're leading me now
