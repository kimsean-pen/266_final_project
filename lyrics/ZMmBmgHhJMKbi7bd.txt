These are the days with the sun
We escape into night, to the haze of the bright lights
We become stars under gold painted eyes
And are dreaming the template for our lives

These are the kisses that burn on our lips every time
Every night we fall in love again
This is the touch that remembers tonight could be the end
So let's go 'til the sunrise

Our time is indestructible
We are put in as lights in the sky
We are gods tonight

(Need to know...)
We own the night
And when we come together
We shake up the ground underneath our feet
No one can say we're too young to decide

That we go where the fire's in the street
Our time is indestructible
We are put in as lights in the sky

We are gods tonight
(Need to know...)
We are free to dream

(This is our time)
Of our becoming
Our time is indestructible
We are put in as lights in the sky
We are gods tonight
(Need to know...)
This is the night to wish, to die, to fall, to show
(Who we are...)
Oh, this is our time and our time is indestructible
Our time is indestructible
