Don't stop
Isn't it funny how you shine?
Don't stop
Isn't it funny how you shine?

Here sea spray give
I was with her
We're under the ship
So get me over

Now that was me
Listen
Now she fishes now
Listen

There was no one out there we used
There is the news for me useless
Now so much waste
How we'll be teased

Ohh, don't stop
Isn't it funny how you shine?
Ohh, don't stop
Isn't it funny how you shine?

Ohh, won't you just ask me?
You're an imbecile
Ohh, What's the matter
For everyone I feel

Pain blue singer
He's pain
Just a guitar
From the top

I, I wake, I still look, I feel loose
We're all here now who's the first
He's into my heart
He must be one of us

Ohh, don't stop
Isn't it funny how you shine?
Ohh, don't stop
Isn't it funny how you shine?
