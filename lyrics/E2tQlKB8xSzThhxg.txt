Beneath the dance hall lights
You see my girl so sound
Lights up the ground

If you give up New York
I'll give you Tennessee
The only place to be

The cowboys burning eyes
Don't like the sight of me
Just straight enough to breathe
I like your point of views
So don't you shy away

Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave

Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave

You had me holding on
All of the time in place
Ride out the wave
Bury yourself away
The one and only face

Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
