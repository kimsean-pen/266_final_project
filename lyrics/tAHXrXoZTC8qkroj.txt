Oh, lover, hold on
'till I come
back again
For these arms
are growing tired
and my tales
are wearing thin

If you're patient
I will surprise
When you wake up
I'll have come
All the ache will
settle down
and we'll go do
all the things we should have done

'Cause I remember what we said
as we lay down to bed
"I'll be here, if you would only come back home"

Oh, lover, I'm lost
Because the road I've chosen
beckons me away
Oh, lover, don't you roam
Now I'm fighting words
I never thought I'd say

But I remember what we said
As we lay down to bed
"I'll forgive you all, if you'll just come back home"

Oh, lover, I know
you'll be out there
and be thinking just of me
and I will find you
down the road
We'll return back home
to where we're meant to be

'Cause I remember what we said
as we lay down to bed
"we'll be back as soon as we make history"
