I slipped
Didn't mean
Didn't mean to do it that way
But I blew in on a whim, gone tomorrow
(shit) I'm gone today

Oh yeah, Oh yeah, oh oh yeah

Come, lets play along
And let each other lose
A win would cause an alarm
Don't matter to me
Doesn't matter to you

Oh yeah, Oh yeah, oh oh oh yeah

I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So free yourself
I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So free yourself

A self-inflicted wound, your gift
Impeccable aim
Can really clear a room
All the bodies piled up in your way

Oh yeah, it hurts
So bad, and it must
I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So free yourself
I could keep you all to myself
I know you gotta be free
To kill yourself
