Stole, ooh ohh, stole

He was always such a nice boy
The quiet one, with good intentions
He was down for his brother
Respectful to his mother, a good boy
But good don't get attention
One kid with a promise
The brightest kid in school
He's not a fool
Reading books about science and smart stuff
It's not enough, no
Cause smart don't make you cool

He's not invisible anymore
With his father's 9 and a broken fuse
Since he walked through that classroom door
He's all over primetime news

Mary's got the same size hands as Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints at Mann's Chinese Theatre show
She coulda been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole, ohh
Now we'll never know
No, no, no, no (stole) ooh, ooh

They were cryin' to the camera
Said he never fitted in
He wasn't welcome
He showed up to the parties we was hanging in
Some guys were puttin' him down
Bullying him 'round, 'round
Now I wish I woulda talked to him
Gave him the time of day
Not turn away
If I woulda then it wouldn't maybe go this far
He might have stayed at home playing angry chords on his guitar

But he's not invisible anymore
With his baggy pants and his legs in chains
Since he walked through that classroom door
Everybody knows his name... ohh oh, oh, oh

Mary's got the same size hands as Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints (ooh)
at Mann's Chinese Theatre show (she coulda been a movie star)
She coulda been a movie star (oh, ohh, ohh)
Never got the chance to go that far (ohh)
Her life was stole (stole), ohh
Now we'll never know
(Now we'll never know, oh, oh)

Greg was always getting net from 20 feet away (20 feet away)
He had a tryout with the Sixers
Couldn't wait for Saturday (Saturday)
Now we're never gonna see him slam
Flying high as Kobe can
His life was stole, ohh (ohh)
Oh now we'll never know
(Now we'll never, never, never know)

Mmm, now we'll never, never, never, never know

Her life was stole (stole), ohh (stole)
Now we'll never know
