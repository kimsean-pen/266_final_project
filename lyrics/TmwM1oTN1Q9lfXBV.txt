A windy day, the cars in slow formation
Not far away a final destination
One mother's son
his father's distant gaze regretting
where they went wrong
He always found it too upsetting

Me and my friend
we lived our lives completely
from start to end
you and your friend so sweetly
with strength and pride
in spite of everything and swimming
against the tide
to obstinately hope of winning

And, at the end, your funny uncle staring
at all your friends with military bearing
And stopped to stand
to smile and speak of you directly
'Good-bye', shake hands
like you did everything correctly
to wipe away the tears
No more pain, no fear
No sorrow or dying
No waiting or crying
These former things have passed away
Another life begins today
