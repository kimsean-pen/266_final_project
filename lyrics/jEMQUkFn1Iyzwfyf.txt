This breaking vow
Rests so near to my tongue
Anchor on the cloud
Shade upon the sun
You took my word for it
The vanishing of doubt
Will unfold my empty space
Your time froze over

I must lead the way to this conclusion
I let you inherit these words I think
Do you see how death will bestow seclusion
The one you are looking for is hidden from you

In my absence now
When time will pass
And nothingness abide
See the evening rise
And take my word for it
Focuses beyond your vision
Will unfold my empty space
Your time froze over

I must lead the way to this conclusion
I let you inherit these words I think
Do you see how death will bestow seclusion
The one you are looking for is hidden from you

Do you remember when it didn't used to be so dark?
And everything was possible
Still?
