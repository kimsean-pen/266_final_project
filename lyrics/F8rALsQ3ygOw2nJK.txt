Katie kept the list of times
Now that she had really done it, done it
So we swarmed like flies
Pretending that we weren't terrified

'Til we snuck out that night
Rolled the Chrysler down the driveway
But once we were inside
Couldn't figure out where we were off to

That was before we had made
Any terrible mistakes

Well, that's just teenage talk
Pink swear that you won't go changing
Drank so much that night
Carved the state of Texas in our forearms

You know I never loved you more
Than when we were hiding from those sirens, sirens
Oh, we laughed so hard
Threw up in your mom's azaleas

That was before we had made any terrible mistakes
That was before we had made any terrible mistakes

That's just teenage talk
I don't think the past is better, better
Just cause it's cased in glass
Protecting us from our now and later

You know I never loved you more
Than when we were hiding from those sirens, sirens
Drank so much that night
Carved the state of Texas in our forearms

How do you see me now?
Now that I'm a little bit older, older
Nevermind the albatross
Smoldering on my shoulder, shoulder
Shoulder, shoulder
