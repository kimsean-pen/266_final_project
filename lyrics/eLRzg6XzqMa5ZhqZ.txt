All the wildlife has disappeared
And earthquakes are always feared
Everywhere one sees explosions
But the ground is still frozen
Some people here have all the power
The rulers in an ivory tower
Constructing a new kind of life
But these creatures are not alive

Chorus:
It's the city of darkness
It's the city of hate
A system without emotion
It's the city of darkness
It's the city of hate
It's just a cruel police-state

The language in the streets is strange
From day to day their meanings change
Everywhere beggars can be found
Collecting things from filthy ground
Useless things dumped in the streets
All this stuff which no one needs
What a contrast between rich and poor
So much poverty, there is no cure

Chorus:
It's the city of darkness
It's the city of hate
A system without emotion
It's the city of darkness
It's the city of hate
It's just a cruel police-state
