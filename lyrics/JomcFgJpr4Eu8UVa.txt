Still protecting the magic feather
Holding tight to a supporting crutch
Writing scripts on worn out leather
Still waiting on a divine touch
Try to ride on waves of activity
In every direction
You're the center and you're always free
In every direction
Feeling safe enough to abandon the void
Ban the zero. ban the noise
Quiet sounds picked up and dissected
All faint shadows reï¬‚ected
Try to ride on waves of activity
In every direction
You're the center and you're always free
In every direction
In every direction
In every direction
In every direction
In every direction
Still protecting the magic feather
Holding tight to a supporting crutch
Writing scripts on worn out leather
Still waiting on a dinive touch
Try toride one waves of activity
In every direction
You're the center and you're always free
In every direction
You're the center and you're always free
In every direction
In every direction
In every direction
In every direction
