Hey (hey hey)
Tell me your weakness
Oh I keep it a secret.
Oh come on just one vice
All right, it's vodka on ice.
But then there's women on bikes,
or just the women who straddle.
Oh now you are a handfull.
I forgot about handfulls.

Tell me your fears.
Okay, it's everyone here.
You mean just all of the people?
Yeah, and all of their peers,
and all of their pets, and their chandeliers,
and their cigarettes,
I haven't smoked in years!

I can hardly stand the sight. (Of it all.)
I can hardly stand the sound. (Of it all.)
I can hardly stand the taste. (Of it all.)
I can hardly stand the smell. (Of it all.)

I can hardly stand the sight. (Of it all.)
I can hardly stand the sound. (Of it all.)
I can hardly stand the taste. (Of it all.)
I can hardly stand the smell. (Of it all.)

Talk about space.
Well it's a beautiful place!
But it's so damn cold!
Just for the human race,
but for the planets and the stars,
and everything else and Mars.
It's like paradise,
spread out with a butter knife.

I can hardly stand the sight. (Of it all.)
I can hardly stand the sound. (Of it all.)
I can hardly stand the taste. (Of it all.)
I can hardly stand the smell. (Of it all.)

I can hardly stand the sight. (Of it all.)
I can hardly stand the sound. (Of it all.)
I can hardly stand the taste. (Of it all.)
I can hardly stand the smell. (Of it all.)

I can hardly stand, I can hardly stand!
Everyone's f*cked and they don't even know.
Everyone's f*cked and they don't even know.

I can hardly stand the sight. (Of it all.)
I can hardly stand the sound. (Of it all.)
I can hardly stand the taste. (Of it all.)
I can hardly stand the smell. (Of it all.)

I can hardly stand, I can hardly stand!
Everybody's f*cked and they don't even know.
Everybody's f*cked and they don't even know.
