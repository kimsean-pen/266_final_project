Darling, since we've been broken
I've been ravaged and stolen
Baby, it hurts like crazy
I've been walking the same road
Don't know which way I'm going
Wasted, lost in a daydream

Long gone, broken from now on
Long gone, been dead for so long

I wanna burn in the fire of love, alright
I wanna burn in the fire of love tonight

Your kiss rips through the shadows
Lipstick poisons this black rose
Haunted and torn from the heavens
You pull the petals from my mouth
They fall and tenderly black out
Baby, it's been so lonely

Long gone, broken from now on
Gone wrong, been dead for so long

I wanna burn in the fire of love, alright
I wanna burn in the fire of love tonight

I'm not your lover
I'm not your saint
I'm not your baby
The bitch to blame

I'm not your honey
I'm not your doll
I'm the one who dies in the fire of love

I wanna burn in the fire of love, alright
I wanna burn in the fire of love tonight

I wanna burn in the fire of love, alright
I wanna burn in the fire of love tonight
