Must cross, destroy, all that you've built
Thieves, break in and steal your green heart
My red heart, turns white as snow
Every new dawn yours could would you know

All you own is gonna burn

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Let's lose it all; buy something beautiful
What next will you sell?
Peace while you sleep

Small green heart
Engraved on a dollar bill
Tell me, could it build a whole universe?
Can it speak or answer your prayers like you hope it will?

Let's lose it all; buy something beautiful
What next will you sell?
Peace while you sleep

All you own is gonna burn

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You're not just a body of flesh, bones and bread
You are alive, his precious child
And your soul will forever live on

Will forever live on
