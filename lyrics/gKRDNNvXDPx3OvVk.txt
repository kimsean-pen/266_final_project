I sit and relax, to come for the light
Welll everyone tries to keep me alive
Look at the sun and look at the sky
Watch how birds fade into the night
Go away, into the night
Go away, into the night

Mistakes have gone, time taken its toll
All that remains, is a emptier hole
Break it down, you break it down
Mistakes have gone, time taken its toll
All that remains, is a emptier hole

Once your children answers their own
Into the night, the fears are gone
Watch your ...i dont hear of the noise
Escape from that mouth
Go away, into the night
Go away, into the night
x 2
Mistakes have gone, time taken its toll
All that remains, is a emptier hole
Blew me down, you blew me down
Mistakes have gone, time taken its toll
All that remains, is a emptier hole
Break it down, you break it down.
