I'll write a book about you, or some fictional character like you
Music to your ears, and deep like a million years
Like a scene in a movie you'll never forget
A song that will stick, which you haven't heard yet
I'll write a book about you, or some fictional character like you
And I'll know you, better than I know myself
And the things you say, will be touching me from far away
Quietly and slow, like the poets blur their words of love
I'll write a book about you, or some fictional character like you
Short and sweet, and covered with chocolate treats
And the end is pure class
Poetry disguised as chemistry and math
I'll write a book about you
I'll write a book about you, or some fictional character like you
I'll write a book about you
I'll write a book about you
When it's over, it's over
Poems must end, to start over again
