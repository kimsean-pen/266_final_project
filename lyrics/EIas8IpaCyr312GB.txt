Maybe I could swim into your thoughts like your drugs do
Paralyze your body
Sick and tired of waking up too
Burning eyes and cigarettes
I'm falling through the couch like a suicide mission tonight
My God, here comes the downside
Wild eyes of terror pray for sex on the beach while
Oceans of kerosene will soak into me
I'm not meant for this world, I just don't see the point
So I don't think about it, don't over think about it
And life is a joke
But everything's riding on me tonight
Been counting the stars and scars
How I'm becoming a work of art
In desperate times and desperate measures
I come so close, my hopes are severed by the downside
A million waves in the ocean crash at once to make you smile
The whispered words "You'd better hide the bullets"
You stayed on the phone and talked to me day and night
Trigger my nightmare once again
And it's fucking loaded in hand
And we'll let the fire rage
The smoke and the drowning flames
My bedroom computer light is the only menace to my new faux wooden blinds
In desperate times and desperate measures
I come so close, my hopes are severed by the downside
A million waves in the ocean crash at once to make you smile
Now, I only pray when it all goes down
I'll be surrounded by all of the ones I've loved and cared about
And then burn it down
And life is a joke
But at least I can love you, naked and tattooed
Counting the stars and scars
And if the pain is a sound, let's slow it down
Desperate times and desperate measures
I come so close, my hopes are severed by the downside
A million waves in the ocean crash at once to make you smile
Now, I only pray when it all goes down
I'll be surrounded by all of the ones I've loved and cared about
And then burn it down
Your serotonin's gone
The kerosene is gone
The sunset is gone
So hold on
