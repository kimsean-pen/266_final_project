I know it's a simple story
But where you gonna hear another one just like this?
Another minute passing, waiting 'round for something to hit...
And then I start to exist, when you were looking for me
Why'd I have to leave and make you thought I'd run?
Maybe I need to be on something
To figure out just what all this means to me
I should have played her something
Shoulda said something then
But it's too late
I know it's a simple story
Gonna have to be a man someday
Let's start a vicious cycle
Let me off the leash and watch me run in the grass
But then I disappear and I show up a few days later
With my foot in a trap
But it's only my heart that's bleeding
I'm howling at the moon just hoping someone understands
That I only came into season when I smelled the blood on the wind
And heard the beat of the band
I know I give no reason to give me something old or give me something new
Why do I even need this?
Gonna have to do what I need to
Just like a teenage summer
The sun beats down and cracks the flags left and right
But it's not just the heat
My body and my head are full of things that keep me up on a night
Like it's only time and distance
You're in a black box and I can't even wait outside
You'll just have to tell me about it
Gonna have to sleep
It's too light...
Let's start a vicious cycle
Let me off the leash and watch me run in the grass
But then I disappear and I show up a few days later
With my foot in a trap
But it's only my heart that's bleeding
I'm howling at the moon just hoping someone understands
That I only came into season when I smelled the blood on the wind
And heard the beat of the band
I know it's just a feeling
Shouldn't even have these thoughts
But it's too late
I know it's a simple story
Gonna have to be a man someday
