We didn't stop to recognize
The thundering fog
Going down with all the lies
Anonymous

Cubes of marble waiting to be
Shaped into grace
Hiding what you'll never see
Victorious
Victorious...

Forgive my tears
When they turn to salt
After facing your fears
It's time to revolt

Symptoms of vanity
Referring pain
Seeming to come from inside

Based on the bad side
I only see
The things you are trying to hide

Forgive my tears
When they turn to salt
After facing your fears
It's time to revolt

Forgive my tears
When they turn to salt
