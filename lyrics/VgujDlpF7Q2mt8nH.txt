I wanna live in the hidden parts of your skin
I wanna be inside, I wanna get locked in
I just wanna dip you in honey
My Japanese bazooka, my alley cat
I like it when you're good but I prefer the bad
And I just wanna dip you in honey

Baby, we were made out of sunshine
Baby, we were made out of stars
Tame the thunderclouds in my mind
'Cause the sunshine won't shine around here no more

I saw my eyes in your eyes and they looked back
I detected life but focused in on the black
I just wanna dip you in honey

Baby, we were made out of sunshine
Baby, we were made out of stars
Tame the thunderclouds in my mind
'Cause the sunshine won't shine around here no more
(Won't shine around here no more)

I just wanna dip you in honey
I just wanna dip you in honey
I just wanna dip you in honey
I just wanna dip you in honey
I just wanna dip you in honey
I just wanna dip you in honey
