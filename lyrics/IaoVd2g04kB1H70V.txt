I keep asking: "What's your lie?"
It is disturbing, this eases my mind
Days keep passing, one notch at a time
I don't feel right, please God let me sleep tonight

Every day confronted, circumvents giving in, I just wanna know why
Want to give it up, no, I can't escape
Want to give it up, no, I can't escape
Want to give it up, no, I can't escape
Want to give it up, no, I can't escape

I keep asking: "Will you again please try?"
It is haunting, this takes my mind
Days keep passing, line after line
I don't feel right, please God don't let me die tonight
Die tonight, die tonight, die tonight

Every day confronted, circumvents giving in, I just wanna know why
Want to give it up, no, I can't escape
Want to give it up, no, I can't escape
Want to give it up, no, I can't escape
Want to give it up, no, I can't escape

Please, God; please, God
Please, God, help me; please, God, free me
Please, God, help me from my painful situation
Please, God, help me; please, God, free me
Please God save me from my painful situation
Please, God, help me; please, God, free me
Please God save me from my painful situation

Please, God, don't let me give in tonight, please, God
Oh, please, God, don't let me give in tonight, please, God
Oh, please, God, don't let me give in tonight, don't let me die
Please, God, don't let me give in tonight, don't let me die
