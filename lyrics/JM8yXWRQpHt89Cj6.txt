The way you're dancing
Makes me come alive
Makes me shiver and perspire
Your surreptitious glancing
The way you crack a smile
You really start a fire

So move closer
I want to feel your touch
So come over
Come on

Love of mine
This fortress in our heart
Feels much weaker
Now we're apart
Love of mine
This fortress in our heart
Comes crashing down

I need a change of skin
I need a change

The way you're moving
Hips from side to side
Makes you all that I desire
Bathsheba of my choosing
I'm so unsatisfied
You've got what I require

So move closer
I gotta feel your touch
So come over
So come on

So move closer
I gotta feel your touch
So come over
Come on

Love of mine
This fortress in our heart
Feels much weaker
Now we're apart
Love of mine
This fortress in our heart
Comes crashing down

I need a change of skin
I need a change

I need a change (I need a change)
I need a change of skin
I need a change (I need a change)
I need a change of skin
I need a change (I need a change)
I need a change of skin
I need a change
I need a change of skin

Love of mine
This fortress in our heart
Feels much weaker
Now we're apart
Love of mine
This fortress in our heart
Comes crashing down
