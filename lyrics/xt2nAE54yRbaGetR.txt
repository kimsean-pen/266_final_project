In every quiet moment
In every little silence
Every small reminder where you find her
With every left light on
Let alone

Every little loving word
Said out of love
Going cold

Little by little I'm laid down
Little by little I'm laid down

I can go wherever
Still the same
Every small reminder of a name
Any half measures
Any pleasures
Every new encounter that's not her
Leaves you cold

Little by little I'm laid down
Little by little I'm laid down

Some day you're going to wake up
And think you went a day without
Going cold
