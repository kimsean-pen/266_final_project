i think youre kute
ill keep you in the cellar
show you to the children
kill me after dinner
youre alright
you look like someone i could bury
in the garden
cover you in diamonds
when i die
and when i die
ill dig you up
ill tear out all your feathers
cook you in the oven
burn myself
what is mommy cookin
she looks like a baby
you love me
do you love me
you wanna die
you really wanna see us laughin
at your body
floating down the river
baby youre pathetic
you are god
you are god
