So falling I again in the aiding tar,
So stall the light and speak to me in the car.
Say something to stop the sound of the siren calls,
Say something to silence all of the sounding stalls away.

So bye, so bowing on again,
To go where the April Isle I know,
Bowing on again and so.

So falling I again in the sinking arc,
So stall the night and drive to the aiding dark.
Say something to stop the flash of the siren calls,
Say something to silence all of the sounding stalls away.

So bye, so bowing on again,
To go where the April Isle I know,
Bowing on again and so.
