She cuts her hair
And calls his name
Wishin' everything could be the same
Like when she had him

I'll give you fish
I'll give you candy
I'll give you everything I have in my hand

Walking out of Korvettes
Package in her hand
Motions to all the seabirds
Throws divinity on the sand

I'll give you fish
I'll give you candy
I'll give you everthing I have in my hand

Give me, give back my man
Give me, give back my man

Her head's in a whirlpool
Spinnin' round and round
If she don't get her man back
She's gonna drown

I'll give you fish
I'll give you candy
I'll give you everything I have in my hand

Give her, give back her man
Give her, give back her man
