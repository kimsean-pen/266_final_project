Light
Blistering, so bright
Re-align my core
Lenses open wide
Coming into form
The imprint of a life

Too late you're calling out my name
To raise me up out of my grave
Alive in memory I'll stay
If you shun these waters where I lay

Night
Curtains coming down
Into the shade I stray
Losing all I've found
To my own dismay
My season has come to an end

Too late you're calling out my name
To raise me up out of my grave
Alive in memory I'll stay
If you shun these waters where I lay

Leave me to rest
Too drained to rise
To try to detect
Any light at the end of the tunnel...

Too late...
