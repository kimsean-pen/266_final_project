I was out the other day
and I saw you in your big black car
I was waving as you were passing
'cause I know who you are.

You had this look that of an angel.
It was such a bad disguise
and did you think for a second I would not realize?

Tripping hard, falling down onto the ground
'cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down
'cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this.

wooh hooh ooh oh
I was out the other night
and I saw you, so we had a fight
It was late and I was lonely

and it was such a long way home.
So I asked you if you'd join me
for a single last call drink
so you turned and bought us two

and you didn't even blink.
You had this look that of an angel
it was such a bad disguise.
When you drink it makes you angry.

When I drink I want you more and more and more.
Tripping hard, falling down onto the ground
'cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down

'cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this.
Tripping hard, falling down onto the ground
'cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down
'cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this.
(Somewhere in the middle)
You know I find it hard

I always try to find the sane life
(Somewhere in the middle)
well I don't like the way things are.
I keep falling to my knees
Somewhere in the middle of this
'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this.
Tripping hard, falling down onto the ground
'cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down
'cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this.
ooh hooh wooh oh
'cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this
Somewhere in the middle
hmm mmm
