I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
Tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some, they may go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flyin' too high with some girl in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flyin' too high with some girl in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick
Hmm, you give me a boot
I get a kick out of you
