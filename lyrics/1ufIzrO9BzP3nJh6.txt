Taking your time
Taking your time
Making your mind up
What you remind
What you remind
What you remind me of
If you in my bed
Feeling so ready to make it out
Don't wanna hold
Don't wanna hold
Don't wanna hold on
Making it hard
Making it, making it hard to know, oh
You, I do it again
You and I, beautiful pain

Hold me so closely
Take charge like you own me
My heart locked in chains
It bends and it breaks
How long can I stay here
Mind hazy, so unclear
Maybe I should raise a glass, or two
Reminisce about the good times with you

I gotta go, I gotta go now
You wanna know
You wanna know why I can't see this out, no
You I won't do this again
You and I beautiful pain

Hold me so closely
Take charge like you own me
My heart locked in chains
It bends and it breaks
How long can I stay here
Mind hazy, so unclear
Maybe I should raise a glass, or two
Reminisce about the good times with you

Taking your time
Taking your time
Making your mind up
What you remind
What you remind
What you remind me of
I gotta go, I gotta go now
You wanna know
You wanna know why I can't see this out
Beautiful pain, I

Hold me so closely
Take charge like you own me
My heart locked in chains
It bends and it breaks
How long can I stay here
Mind hazy, so unclear
Maybe I should raise a glass, or two
Reminisce about the good times with you
