Walkin' down this rocky road wonderin' where my life is leading
Rollin' on to the bitter end
Finding out along the way what it takes to keep love living
You should know how it feels my friend
Ooh...
I want you to stay...

Ooh...
I want you today

I'm ready for love
Oh baby I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Oh baby I'm ready for love
Yeah

Oh-oh
For your love
Now I'm on my feet again
Better things are bound to happen
All my dues surely must be paid...
Many miles and many tears

Times were hard but now there changing

You should know that I'm not afraid
Woo hoo
Ooh...
I want you to stay

Ooh...
I want you today
I'm ready for love

Oh baby I'm ready for love
Ready for love

Oh baby I'm ready for love
Ooh... ooh-ooh
Oh I'm ready for love
Hey-h-e-y...
Ready for your love
Ooh...
I want you to stay
Ooh...
I want you today
I'm ready for love
Oh baby I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Oh baby I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Oh baby I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Oh baby I'm ready for your love
(ooh...) I I I I (ooh... ooh...)
Whoa oh-oh-oh
For... whoa oh
I'm ready for your love

Mmm... hmm-hmm
