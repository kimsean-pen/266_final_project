Dog Day Sunrise
Every day of my life
I'm working on a scheme
Working overtime underground
Girls work under floors
The failures tend the moors
But once the seem is cut
They find out what is learned

Drag your feet through hollow streets
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Drag your feet through hollow streets
