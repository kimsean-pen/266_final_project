Another world
Another time
In the age of wonder
Another world
Another time
This land was green & good
Until the crystal cracked
Once more
They will replenish themselves
Cheat death again
The power of their source
The crystal

I've got the understanding of a 4-year-old
I've got the peice of mind of a killer soul
I've got the rationale of a new york cop
I've got the patience of a chopping block yeahtrip like I do

Trip like I do (oh my God this is the best)

Uh
I want you to trip like me I want you to have fun
Me & you

I've got the accumen of a seasoned pro
I've got the lack of say of a billion souls
I've got the world on my back but I don't seem to care
I've got the comprehension of a world unaware yeah

Trip like I do
Trip like I do (oh my God this is the best)
Trip like I do (mm.i want you to trip like I do)

Can't you can't you trip like I do
Can't you can't you trip like I do

Laid down my back I can't sleep cause I'm falling
Eyes in my teeth I can't see cause I'm eating
Head full of noise I can't think cause it's crushing
Back on my feet like a freight trian I'm coming
Can everybody feel like I do
Can everybody feel like I do (oh my God)

Can't you can't you trip like I do
Can't you can't you trip like I do (oh my God)

Can't you trip can't you think can't you feel like I do
Can't you walk can't you breathe can't you trip like I do... like me...
