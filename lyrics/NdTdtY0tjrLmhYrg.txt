As the pressure grows
and these feelings flow
Trample on bodies,
bodies in holes of faith

Times I've asked the lord
for forgiveness
while kept under a spell
of a sweating locust's breath

No need to tell me
'cos its written on your face
Sliding down now
with the black lights shining

I don't care where you go you won't get away from me
Black as the night is day filled with no sympathy
Marching down the hall for a misery
I don't care where you go you won't get away from me
You won't get away from me X2
Get away from me
You won't get away from me

Mouth tastes of sick
my stomach twisting inside
Everything's wrong
and I can't get away

The gravity of fear
you can feel it coming near
It's coming straight for you,
it'll twist and drag you down

I don't care where you go you won't get away from me
Black as the night is day filled with no sympathy
Marching down the hall for a misery
I don't care where you go you won't get away from me
You won't get away from me X2
Get away from me
You won't get away from me
