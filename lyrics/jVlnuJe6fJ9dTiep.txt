The Crossbreaker, the pain reliever,
I'll rip the nails from your veins.
To the believers who shout deceiver: Dare you to spit in my face.
Offered you a finer truth, a realm beyond your shallow pain.
The universe becomes a pulpit lose yourself in infinity space.

Crossbreaker

Are you caught up in the storm? Or do you watch the rain pour?
Time is nothing for the Crossbreaker, the pain reliever.
I'll put you straight in your grave.
True power cast in stone.
The ether shifts to any form

Crossbreaker

Are you caught up in the storm?

A warrior reborn; with the knowledge to guide him home
Become the center of the void and let go.

Crossbreake
