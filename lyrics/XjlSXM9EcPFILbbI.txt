Paint it red and yellow, white
And don't forget the skull
Give it just some mellow vibes
Try not to make it dull
Give it time and she'll be all mine
Just like Juliet
Keep on wondering if she has
Fallen in love with me yet

Don't make me cry
I need a woman in my life

Make her soul glow silver
Just like the rings she wears
Take away every little thing
She don't even care
Give it time and she'll be all mine
Just like Juliet
Keep on wondering if she has
Fallen in love with me yet

Don't make me cry
I need a woman in my life
Don't make me cry
I need a woman in my life
