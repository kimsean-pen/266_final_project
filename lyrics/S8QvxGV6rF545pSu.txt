Oh have I been too discreet
How long am I supposed to wait
I think about you nightly
Oh can you tell I'm losing sleep

Oh what am I supposed to do
It's hard to stay cool
Oh when you smile at me
And I get nervous every time you speak

My bed's too big for just me
When you turn your eyes
I promise I won't care
Oh standing by your sister fair

Oh baby baby baby please
My heart sinks to my feet
Oh what am I supposed to do
I think about you nightly

My bed's too big for just me
When you turn your eyes
I promise I won't care
Oh standing by your sister fair When I look in your eyes
I tend to lose my thoughts
But don't forget your stare
Oh what was that you said
Would you let me know
'Cause I can't read your mind
Oh can you tell
I can't even explain

Oh baby I can't even explain
Oh what am I supposed to do
It's hard to stay cool
Oh when you smile at me
And I get nervous every time you speak
Oh, standing by your sister fair
