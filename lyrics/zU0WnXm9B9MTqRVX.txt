Coercion and threats
Made there dernans
Held the past over my head
One mistake has made me there tool
Blackmailing a means to the end, I'm forced into the pact

Murderer
Is that what I am?

Hornicide
How can I stop this?

Not a violent man but now I'm forced to kill
Seems to be no other way
Trapped by an accident, tragic and fatal
The crime was unintentional, but this I cannot prove

Murderer
Is there no way out?

Suicide
Is that the answer?

Desperation
Deal has been made
No turning back
I'm bound to kill by the murderer's pact

Steel myself for the task at hand
Preparing the tools that I need
Sharpen the blades, make thekill quick
Extortion drove me to the dead, I take from it no joy

Murderer
Now I will do this

Hornicide
I have made choice

Sins of the past
Haunt me today
Should have confessed

Motive concealed
Undetected
Hunting him down
His life will end
I'm bound to kill by the murderer's pact

Thrust of the blade repulses
Commit the heinous crime
Stabbing him repeatedly
Gouge his neck, slash his face

See his look of terror
He knows his time has come
Cannot show him mercy
Make him die, finish it

Blodd on the knife
His body slumps
Corpse left to rot
The dead is done

But in my mind
There is no peace
Two dark secrets
That I must keep
I'm bound to kill by tthe murderer's pact
