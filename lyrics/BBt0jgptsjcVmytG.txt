Well, if you listen you will hear that sound right there in my mind, tonight
And, if you listen you will hear that sound right there in my mind
Well, if you listen you will hear that sound right there in my mind, tonight
But, if you listen do you hear that sound right there in my mind?

Old man in my face
Hoped to save the greater child
Hot as the day is long
Hot as the smoking gun

But, if you listen you will hear that sound right there in my mind, tonight
And, if you listen you will hear that sound right there in my mind
Well, if you listen you will hear that sound right there in my mind, tonight
But, if you listen do you hear that sound right there in my mind?

Now let the careless out
Let's let the place go away
We're near the comforted rocks
We both could close their eyes
We both could close their eyes
We were this close to time
Oh, let the place go

Well, if you listen you will hear that sound right there in my mind, tonight
And, if you listen you will hear that sound right there in my mind
But, if you listen you can hear that sound right there in my mind, tonight
But, if you listen do you hear that sound right there in my mind?

Old man in my face
Hoped to save the greater child
Hot as the day is long
Hot as the smoking gun

Well, if you listen do you hear that sound right there in my mind, tonight?
And, if you listen you will hear that sound right there in my mind
But, if you listen do you hear that sound right there in my mind, tonight?
But, if you listen do you hear that sound right there in my mind?
