Golden brown texture like sun
Lays me down with my mind she runs
Throughout the night
No need to fight
Never a frown with golden brown

Every time just like the last
On her ship tied to the mast
To distant lands
Takes both my hands
Never a frown with golden brown

Golden brown finer temptress
Through the ages she's heading west
From far away
Stays for a day
Never a frown with golden brown

Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Never a (never a frown) frown
With golden brown (with golden brown)
Never a (never a frown) frown
With golden brown (with golden brown)
Never a (never a frown) frown
With golden brown (with golden brown)
Never a (never a frown) frown
With golden brown (with golden brown)
Never a (never a frown) frown
With golden brown (with golden brown)
