Always crashing to the ground
Always from the same height
Always falling down
And if you start a fashion now
Make me a believer
The seas will part somehow

Staring at a silver sun
I'm blinded
I can see you almost in my town
Nothing but a seat of blue
Seperating seasons
And I think of you

Burning in the face of love
Burning in the face of love

Walking through a paper town
Counting all the reasons to burn the others down
Seems like every chance I take
Brings me ever closer to being far away

Black out
Keep your colours dim
So nobody can see you
And let the ghost back in
Leave me heading to the ground
Always from the same height
And always falling down

Burning in the face of love
Burning in the face of love
Burning in the face of love
Burning in the face of love

(Falling
I'm Falling
Falling
I'm Falling
Falling
I'm Falling
Falling
I'm Falling)

(Building
Building
Building gone
Buildng bones are hard to hold
Mould is forming on the ground
Nobody is lost
Nobody is found)

(Building
Building
Building gone
Bulging bones are hard to hold
Mould is forming on the ground
Nobody is lost
Nobody is found)

Burning in the face of love
Burning in the face of love
Burning in the face of love
Burning in the face of love
