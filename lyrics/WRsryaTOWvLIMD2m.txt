I wrote a letter to the MTV
What's goin' on
Don't you care about me
Sent the same letter to the radio
But my party went dead
Like a shot in the head

We all like it, rock and roll
We all want it, on your show
Play it loud, don't play it low
Blow your speakers with rock and roll

We got lots of stations
Around the nation
And the stuff they're playin'
It just ain't worth sayin'
People want music
To get 'em movin'
We don't want labels
We want music on the table

We all like it, rock and roll
We all want it, on your show
Play it loud, don't play it low
Blow your speakers with rock and roll

We all like it, rock and roll
We all want it, on your show
Play it loud, don't play it low
Blow your speakers with rock and roll

We got lots of stations
Around the nation
And the stuff they're playin'
It just ain't worth sayin'

We all like it, rock and roll
We all want it, on your show
Play it loud, don't play it low
Blow your speakers with rock and roll

Blow your speakers with rock and roll
Blow your speakers with rock and roll
Blow your speakers with rock and roll
Blow your speakers with rock and roll

Blow your speakers with rock and roll
Blow your speakers with rock and roll
Blow your speakers with rock and roll
Blow your speakers with rock and roll
