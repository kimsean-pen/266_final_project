We try to go back
But it's not the same
You can call back
But I don't know what to say
Was it my fault?
I guess things fade
So when we part ways
Just remember my face

We try to go back
But it's not the same
You can call back
But I don't know what to say
Was it my fault?
I guess things fade
So when we part ways
Just remember my face

And I'm so low
Tired of feeling like I'm never worth it
Anti-social
I only see the world looking through my curtains
Time wasted
This will never work out, time to face it
No patience
Push you away, jealousy and self-hatred

We try to go back
But it's not the same
You can call back
But I don't know what to say
Was it my fault?
I guess things fade
So when we part ways
Just remember my face
We try to go back
But its not the same
You can call back
But I don't know what to say
Was it my fault?
I guess things fade
So when we part ways
Just remember my face

Why do we keep acting like we're okay?
Feel like someone's always walking out the doorway
All I do is bring you down when I'm with you
I can't call you every time I start to miss you
So tell me
Will I sink or will I swim?
It's like I'm trapped in my skin

We try to go back
But it's not the same
You can call back
But I don't know what to say
Was it my fault?
I guess things fade
So when we part ways
Just remember my face
We try to go back
But it's not the same
You can call back
But I don't know what to say
Was it my fault?
I guess things fade
So when we part ways
Just remember my face
