You're worthless to me!

Have you nothing to say?
Can't you see what you're doing to me?
You keep breaking me down
But I won't let you get the better of me
I can't take anymore

Look at me!
Is this what you want?
Look at me!
Am I what you need?
One more word and I'm taking this all away
I won't take anymore

You can keep all your apologies
Those words are worthless to me
And I don't wanna hear that you're sorry
Your words mean nothing to me

Has this opened your eyes?
It was only a matter of time
I can tell by that look on your face
on your face
That you know the tables have turned
No one's fault but your own

Look at me!
Tell me what you see
Look at me!
Am I what you need?
One more word and I'm taking this all away
I won't take anymore

You can keep all your apologies
Those words are worthless to me
And I don't wanna hear that you're sorry
Your words mean nothing to me

No I don't wanna hear that you're sorry
Your words are worthless to me

You can keep all your apologies
Nothing to me!

You can keep all your apologies
Those words are worthless to me
And I don't wanna hear that you're sorry
Your words mean nothing to me
No I don't wanna hear that you're sorry
Your words mean nothing to me
And I don't wanna hear that you're sorry
Your words are worthless to me!
They mean nothing!
