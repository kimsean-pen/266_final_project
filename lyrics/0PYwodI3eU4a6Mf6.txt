I went down to the local gypsy
And I handed her the same line
You know what I want from you
So honey, won't ya gimme number nine?

'Cause you know lately I ain't feelin' so great
Last time she gave me love potion number eight
And you know pretty baby, how I think you're pretty smart
But one sip from this bottle and I'll tear you all apart

The gypsy told me that the first thing
That would happen you get dizzy
Second thing you better make sure
That your boyfriend isn't busy

'Cause you don't wanna eat
And you won't wanna drink
You won't wanna talk
And you don't wanna think
My mother used to tell me not to kiss on the first date
This time when I see you, you know I ain't gonna wait

I'll kiss you, gonna corner you and not let you go
I'll kiss you, don't tell me nothin', I don't wanna know
And twidely-dee and twidely-dum
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you

Hopped into a taxi and I told the driver
Got to get me cross town
Killed the bottle, started seeing double
When the driver turned around

And though I was a failure with love potion number eight
Number nine was different and the hour's getting late
Now I'm standin' on the corner, everyone looks great to me
And if you come and get me take me where I want to be

I'll kiss you, gonna corner you and not let you go
I'll kiss you, don't tell me nothin', I don't wanna know
And twidely-dee and twidely-dum
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you

'Cause you know lately I ain't feelin' so great
Last time she gave me love potion number eight
And you know pretty baby, how I think you're pretty smart
But one sip from this bottle and I'll tear you all apart

I'll kiss you, gonna corner you and not let you go
I'll kiss you, don't tell me nothin', I don't wanna know
And twidely-dee and twidely-dum
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you

Oh, you know lately I ain't feelin' so great
Last time she gave me love potion number eight
And you know pretty baby
Oh, I don't wanna talk and I don't wanna think
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you
Stop twidely--dee and twidely--dum, oh yeah
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you
Oh, I don't wanna talk and I don't wanna think
I was a failure with love potion number eight
But number nine was different and the hour's getting late
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you
Oh, I don't wanna talk and I don't wanna sleep
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you
