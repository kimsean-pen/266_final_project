You moved like honey in my dream last night
Yeah, some old fires were burning
You came near to me and you endeared to me
But you couldn't quite discern me

Does that scare you?
I'll let you run away
But your heart will not oblige you
You'll remember me like a melody
Yeah, I'll haunt the world inside you

And my big secret -- gonna win you over
slow like honey, heavy with mood

I'll let you see me, I'll covet your regard
I'll invade your demeanor
And you'll yield to me like a scent in the breeze
and you'll wonder what it is about me

It's my big secret -- keeping you coming
slow like honey, heavy with mood

Though dreams can be deceiving
like faces are to hearts
they serve for sweet relieving
****when fantasy and reality lie too far apart****

So I stretch myself across, like a bridge
and I pull you to the edge
And I stand there waiting
trying to attain
the end to satisfy the story
Shall I release you?
Must I release you?
As I rise to meet my glory

But my big secret --
gonna hover over your life
gonna keep you reaching
when I'm gone like yesterday
when I'm high like heaven
when I'm strong like music

Cause I'm slow like honey, and
heavy with mood
