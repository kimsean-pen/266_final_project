This is for my dream
This is for my love

I'll do anything I wanna do
You already know
On my grind I put in work
Determination in my soul
부족한 점 많아 갈 길이 멀었어
쉽게 포기하지 않아 No

위로
Is the only path I'm choosing
위로
Is the only way I'm going
앞길은 선명해 성공할 거 분명해
Yeah yeah

I'm running 그곳으로 가고 있어
조금만 지나면 다 보일 텐데
힘들 땐 어두운 긴 터널과 같아
Let's say
It's another beautiful night

And this is for my dream
This is for my love
Every time I run
I'm just movin' on and on and on

This is for my dream
This is for my love
Every time I run
I'm just movin' on and on and on

I'm walking down the hallway
Been waiting for the D-day
No matter what they say
Go at my own pace

Believing I can make it yeah
Spotlight shining at me
One day yeah
Ambition be my compass
I row, I row
Like no tomorrow

I'm running 그곳으로 가고 있어
조금만 지나면 다 보일 텐데
힘들 땐 어두운 긴 터널과 같아
Let's say
It's another beautiful night

And this is for my dream
This is for my love
Every time I run
I'm just movin' on and on and on

This is for my dream
This is for my love
Every time I run
I'm just movin' on and on and on

There's beauty in the struggle
그래서 나는 빛나
미룬 적 없어 Right now
매 순간에 My rhyme
Hate or love it, I'm so blessed
Hate or love it, I'm so blessed

If you tell me why 난 나의 삶을 살아
누가 기대하든 말든 Keep it my way
Hate or love it, I'm so blessed
Hate or love it, I'm so blessed

And this is for my dream
This is for my love
Every time I run
I'm just movin' on and on and on

This is for my dream
This is for my love
Every time I run
I'm just movin' on and on and on
