Don't let em take it away from you
You give up and .you through
Don't let em take it away from you
Away from you, away from you.

What's wrong with this world today
Don't get it, .admit it.
We let em take every day for free
Don't get it, .admit it.

You're the light, break the pads,
Take this back. Before will erase.

White lights, who'll be told
when they pass out the blindfolds
We're out of pace, out of time
But the lucky ones are see first light
Show show show, show show show.

What's wrong with anxiety
Don't get it, .admit it,
Stand up for what you believe
Don't get it, .admit it,

You're the. break the pace. the face.

White lights, who'll be told
when they pass out the blindfolds
We're out of pace, out of time
But the lucky ones are see first light
Freedom will.so pass out the black walls
But out of place, out of time,
But the lucky ones are see first light

2 x
Don't let em take the freedom away
You wanna give what they take every day.

I pray for you, generation without a clue
I'll pray for you
Generation without a clue
