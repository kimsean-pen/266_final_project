Held down, strangled and abused
Cut down to half a member
Left with his hand tied
Everything points in the wrong direction

All the joy disappeared
The negative has penetrated
Once he was in control
What's left, the faintest laughter

(Chorus)
We're out of focus, we've lost control
I blame our ego and you call me names

You're told that you are trapped below
And dark signs helped to prove
You got to reach further
For what life shall provide

Feeling pressure from the fold
He believes the dream is over
Drained blue eye, scorching fire
The whole meaning becomes undone

(Chorus)
We're out of focus, we've lost control
I blame our ego and you call me names

You're told that you are trapped below
And dark signs helped to prove
You got to reach further
For what life shall provide

(Chorus)
We're out of focus, we've lost control
I blame our ego and you call me names

You're told that you are trapped below
And dark signs helped to prove
You got to reach further
For what life shall provide
