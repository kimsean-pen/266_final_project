Look at me down to every pixel
Do you really get the whole picture?
Watching 3D, color by color
There's more than all this pretty
If you looking better, cover

I do this for you
I only do this for you
I do this for you
I only do this for you

Can you say me I'll go down later
I'm not hiding under no filter
I set my heart on fire
To make my love shine brighter
I give it only if you ready to take it

I do this for you
I only do this for you
I do this for you
I only do this for you
I do this for you
I only do this for you
I do this for you
I only do this for you

I give it all and turn it inside out
I'm giving up if you don't know right now
Your everything I see
Why don't you see me?
You know I really need
Is you to need me
I do it, I do it, I do it, I do it

I do this for you
I only do this for you
I do this for you
I only do this for you
I do this for you
I only do this for you
I do this for you
I only do this for you

I do this for you
