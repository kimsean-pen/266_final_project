Time slows and fills me with feeling
A blood moon that the sun is concealing
And each night, when my thoughts are congealing
It's here again

So here I stand with my head in hand
Trying to heal my sunburnt soul
A sword and shield on the battlefield
Trying to take back some control
'Cause I can't see through this
Black hole

Storms swell in a tide of emotion
A typhoon rising up from the ocean
The day kneels in its ceaseless devotion
It's here again

So here I stand with my head in hand
Trying to heal my sunburnt soul
A sword and shield on the battlefield
Trying to take back some control
'Cause I can't see through this

Wave after wave before me to strike me down
Bound for the grave without much to keep me 'round
Hold back these tears or else I will drown in them
And reach out a broken hand for help and I'll start again
Yeah

So here I stand with my head in hand
Trying to heal my sunburnt soul
A sword and shield on the battlefield
Trying to take back some control
'Cause I can't see through this, someone help me

Oh, trying to heal my sunburnt soul
A sword and shield on the battlefield
Trying to take back some control
'Cause I can't see through this
Black hole
