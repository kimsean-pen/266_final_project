I've seen times when I used hang out all night
Girls back to back, I knew it wasn't right
Never thought that I would ever meet a girl
So fine so fresh, who could rock my world
Oh God, I'm hooked into her web
Fellas, I apologize but I have to step
Gotta feeling, a hunch, by the look in her eye
She's my inspiration, I need her in my life

You know that it's true
You can call me crazy
You can call me crazy

You know I'm hooked on you
I guess I'm strung out
Whatever you may call it, it's love without a doubt
Perfect this feeling so strong, I need her love tonight
I don't care what you say, I know this love is right

You know that it's true
You can call me crazy, you can call me crazy

You can call me crazy, you can call me crazy, you can call me crazy
You can call me crazy, you can call me crazy
You know that it's true
You can call me crazy, you can call me crazy
You can call me crazy, you can call me crazy
You know that it's true
You can call me crazy, you can call me crazy
You can call me crazy, you can call me crazy
You know that it's true
You can call me crazy
