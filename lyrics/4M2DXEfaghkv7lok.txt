I got that comeback
The hubba bubba
I got the run back
Run back and tell you mother
I throw the RA-RA
Only up when they go all the way down
I got a lifetime warranty
Guaranteed
You'll never leave

Warning
Beware, handle with care
If you're lucky
There's a chance you'll make it there
This is serious
Girls like me is so rare

Once I get that
Imma put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him

Now I know what I'm doing
Whatchu gon' do with this?
I'll let you catch a feeling
With just a little bit
Don't wanna rush into it
And catch a sugar fit

Once I get that
Imma put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him

I got that comeback
The hubba bubba
I got the run back
Run back and tell you mother
I throw the RA-RA
Only up when they go all the way down
I got a lifetime warranty
Guaranteed
You'll never leave

Caution
Keep away from open flames
Cause it's hot hot hot
Fire marshals can't contain it
You need rehab
Cos this thing is so addictive

When you put that on her
Put that on her,
Put that, put that, put that on her

Now having lines with pleasure
You're now too close behind
I won't give you directions
You better read the signs
I'll reach my destination
You better fall in line

Once I get that
Imma put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him

I got that comeback
The hubba bubba
I got the run back
Run back and tell you mother
I throw the RA-RA
Only up when they go all the way down
I got a lifetime warranty
Guaranteed
You'll never leave

Don't ask me questions about
you thinking what I'm 'bout to do
Don't be all clingy on me
I'm sure I'll finish with you
I'll leave you traces of me
But you better have a clue
Or I ain't coming back to you

I got that comeback
The hubba bubba
I got the run back
Run back and tell you mother
I throw the RA-RA
Only up when they go all the way down
I got a lifetime warranty
Guaranteed
You'll never leave

Thinking it's the wrong truth?
You can go away now, but you gonna return
Thinking it's the wrong truth?
You can go away now, but you gonna return
Return to me

Once I get that
Imma put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him

Hey!
