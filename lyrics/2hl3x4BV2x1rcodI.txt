Sometimes the bad guys go right on top
Sometimes the good guys lose
We try not to lose our hearts, not to lose our minds

Sometimes the bad days may take their grip
Sometimes the good days fade
But the rain today hurts the drink to drink

But nothing ever stays the same
Nothings explained
Cause this isnt the road we know
Lose no more time
No time
Cause its been fun
I heard that you called me
From far away, far like the king Tut
Having the force to make it right
So I just cry

I fell to stay good
So been away
Before couldnt see
And were gone
But nothing ever stays the same
Nothings explained
Lose no more time
No time
Cause it's been fun

But nothing ever stays the same
Nothings explained
Lose no more time
No time
Cause it's been fun
Cause it's been fun
Cause it's been fun
Cause it's been fun
Cause it's been fun
Cause it's been fun
