I run a comb through my hair
And step out in the street
And the city's the color of flame
In the mid-summer heat

Oh yeah
Jennifer's got her daddy's car
She's playing "Uptown" on the stereo
We go cruisin' so close

The way they did long ago
My darlin'
(Turn) turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close never let me go

(Keep) keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control
Baby, baby
(When) when I look in your eyes, I go crazy

Fever's high with the lights down low
(So take) take me over the edge
Make me lose control
We put the top down and park 'neath the moon

In the sky
And the wind is so hot in our hair, like a fire in July
Whoa yeah
Jennifer's singin' "Stand By Me,"

And she knows every single word by heart
Was love always this good?
Or could this be just the start?
Whoa darlin'

(Turn) turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close never let me go
(Keep) keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control

Baby, baby
(When) when I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low

(So take) take me over the edge
Make me lose control
"Be My Baby" comes on, and were movin' in time
And the heat from your touch makes me feel

Like I'm losing my mind
Whoa yeah
(And then they played) "Back In My Arms" again
(We close our eyes) we start rememberin' when

(We start to kiss) and now the feeling's intense
And we just pray that this night never ends
Wohohoho, my darlin'
(Turn) turn the radio up for that sweet sound

Hold me close never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control
Baaby

When I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
(So take) take me over the edge
Make me lose control

Baby, baby
(Turn) turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close never let me go
(Keep) keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control
When I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
(So take) take me over the edge
Make me lose control
Baby, baby
(Turn) turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close never let me go
(Keep) keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control
