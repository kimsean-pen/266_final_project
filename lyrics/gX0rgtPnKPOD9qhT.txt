Something that you do
Hypnotizes me
Sets my soul at ease
Every time you're near me
I'm in Heaven baby

I don't know how you do it
Never felt like this before
I don't wanna lose it
Give me all your love
(More and more and more)

Something that you do
Mesmerizes me
Sets my body free
Every time you touch me
I'm in Heaven baby

I don't know how you do it
Never felt so sweet before
I don't wanna lose it
Give me all your love
(More and more and more)

I just wanna be around you
Tell me are you feelin' the same, oh baby
I just wanna be around you
(Every minute of the day)
Oh I never gonna let you go

Ohh baby
Every time you smile
Captivates my mind
And it lifts me to the sky
Oh anytime you touch me
I'm in Heaven baby

I don't now how you do it
Never felt so sweet before
Oh I don't wanna lose it
Give me all your love, oh

I just wanna be around you
Tell me are you feelin' the same
(Tell me are you feelin')
Oh baby
I just wanna be around you
Every minute of the day
Oh I never gonna let you go

I just want
(To be the only one you live for, baby)
I just want
(To give you all my love)
More and more and more

I just wanna, wanna give it to you
Gonna give you my love
I just wanna, wanna give it to you
Gotta give you my love
I just wanna, wanna give it to you
(Gotta give you)
Gonna give you my love
I just wanna, wanna give it to you
(Gotta give you)
Gotta give you my love

I just want
To be the only one you live for, baby
I just want
To give you all my love
(More and more and more)

I just wanna be around you
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Tell me are you feelin' the same
(Are you feelin')
Oh baby
I just wanna be around you
(Every minute of the day)
Oh I never gonna let you go

I just wanna be around you
(No, no)
Tell me are you feelin' the same
[Incomprehensible]
Oh baby
I just wanna be around you
(I just wanna be near you)
(Every minute of the day)
Oh I never gonna let you go
