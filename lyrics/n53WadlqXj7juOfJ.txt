Hey Girl
Come wander in the cool breeze
And hey world
Give it up with deep breeze
Cause I know that you
Wanna swing your hips in the solar eclipse
And watch this new day rise
Hey Girl
Move right across a country
And hey Girl
Don't listen to your mommy
Cause I know that you
Wanna show the rest that you're movin'out west
And hey Girl
I'm really gonna miss ya
