As a kingdom drowns, spirals into the sea
We think that we are the highest of the evolved
How many times have we been here before
Why did we think this could never happen to us

History doesn't lie
False stories told to subdue the flock
Minds opened
Cities fall as fast as they're built
History doesn't lie
The landscape will tell the true story

This earth had the power to provide for all
Soon it will provide for none

Our precious dreams set to explode
The illusion that once was now gone
Time to drink from this poisoned well
The day will come that our reign will end

Innocence a false claim
All guilty in part
False hopes handed down through generation
Premonitions been told for centuries
Falling on our deaf ears
Our secrets buried in the dust of time
A warning for future man
But will they observe or will they continue
Replicating in a new age
