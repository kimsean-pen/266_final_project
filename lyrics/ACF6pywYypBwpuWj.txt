I'll be trying too hard when I already lost
I can't bet on these cards, cause I know what they'll cost
If I get a scent that's meant to trip my reason
I'm sold, I can't be told to pass what I had last

I don't wanna get down in the flame
Why you gotta make me play this game?
Just like a honest liar, taking on heavy fire
I don't wanna melt down in the heat
Like I got the devil at my feet
Just like a funeral pyre, taking on heavy fire

(...eh uh, uh-uh, eh uh, uh-uh, eh uh, uh-uh)

So give it to me, throw me some shade
Why can't I see this conclusion I've saved?
When I think about the doubt that I depend on
I'm sold, I can't be told to pass what I had last

I don't wanna get down in the flame
Why you gotta make me play this game?
Just like a honest liar, taking on heavy fire
I don't wanna melt down in the heat
Like I got the devil at my feet
Just like a funeral pyre, taking on heavy fire

(fire! oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah yea-yeah eh, oh oh oh oh oh yeah eh, oh oh oh oh)

Just like an honest liar, taking on a heavy fire

(uh-uh, eh uh, uh-uh, eh uh, uh-uh, eh uh, uh-uh, eh uh, uh-uh, eh uh, uh-uh, eh uh, uh-uh, eh uh, uh-uh, eh uh, uh-uh, eh uh, uh-uh, eh uh, uh-uh)

I feel so complete, just like an honest liar, taking on heavy fire
