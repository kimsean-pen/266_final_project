Head down
Walk the line with no opinion
First time
Full collapse, no conversation
Hey now, what are we fighting for?
Hey now, what are we lying for?

Bent back
No belief and no religion
Storm crack
Say goodbye to indecision
(We own) Hey now, what are we fighting for?

(We own) Hey now, what are we lying for?
(We own the night)
We own the night, we burn the light
Feel it come alive
We own the night, we set the fire
Feel it come alive
Deny it, Defy it
I'll stand and still defy it
Thee have realized, There shall be light (?)
Go every mile, We own the night

Strict line
Feel alive, no inhibitions
Cave in
Lotta' breathe, no hesitation

Hey now, what are we fighting for?
Hey now, what are we lying for?

Well try
Fuel the fire of our addictions
Slow ride

Twist the line from correlation
(We own) Hey now, what are we fighting for?
(We own) Hey now, what are we lying for?
(We own the night)
We own the night, we burn the light
Feel it come alive
We own the night, we set the fire
Feel it come alive
Deny it, Defy it
I'll stand and still defy it

Thee have realized, There shall be light (?)
Go every mile, We own the night
Turn out the audio
Lose yourself in all control tonight
I'll keep on coming my way
Until there is a change
Caught in the undertow
Ride along and added more to life

I'll keep on counting my days
Until I start again
(We own) (We own)

We own the night
We own the night, we burn the light
Feel it come alive
We own the night, we set the fire
Feel it come alive
Deny it, Defy it
I'll stand and still defy it
Thee have realized, There shall be light (?)
Go every mile, We own the night
Hey now, what are we fighting for?
Hey now, what are we lying for?
(We own the night)
Deny it, Defy it
I'll stand and still defy it
Thee have realized, There shall be light (?)
Go every mile, We own the night
