I Think it's turning back around
And I think I like it
I think it's turning back around
Though I don't know why it is

I think it's turning back on me
I'm down on the upside
I think it's turning back on me
Now I'm on the good ride

And nothing's gonna put me out
It's backing down and under
I'm down on the upside now
It's turning back around
Turning back around, ooh

I think it's coming on the wind
Just like you said it
I think it's coming on the wind
And I'm gonna let it

I think it's turning back on me
Everything's easy
I think it's turning back on me
Everything's real to me

And nothing's gonna put me out
It's backing down and under
I'm down on the upside now
It's turning back around
Turning back around
Turning back around, ooh

I think it's coming on the wind
Just like you said it
I think it's coming on the wind
And I'm gonna let it

And nothing's gonna put me out, yeah
It's backing down and under
I'm down on the upside now
It's turning back around
Turning back around
Turning back around

Turning back around (turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin')
Turning back around (turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin')
Turning back around (turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin')
Turning back around (turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin')
Turning back around, oh, ooh
