My man don't want me no more
He said he needed his time
To clear his mind.
Meanwhile I'm losing mine

We're at the crossroads my dear
Where do we go from here?
Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you either way
Its such a lonely road

Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears

Oh! When I cry your name am I calling in vain?
Or am I waiting only to drown in pain?
Oh! Don't you do it, no, said don't you leave me this way
I don't know if I can lift my head and face another day
Ooh, its such a lonely road

Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears

Usually not the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
Who could this be staring at me?
When I'm looking in the mirror try'na find a resolution
Are we too far gone to find our way home?

Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears, oh
Where do we go from here?
(Maybe you wont go, maybe you'll stay)
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears
(Follow either way)
