You don't have to say you're sorry
All the lights are getting blurry
Cry yourself to sleep and in the morning we can start it over
Say your prayers and count your blessings
Turn away as you're undressing
All the girls with your eyes you have been, cause they will never know you
Held down by the devil's hand
Dressed up like a gentleman
You got me crying on every time
There must be something wrong
Lights on in the middle of the night
If I give a little more will it make it right
You know I'm trying, in the end
There must be something wrong
On the floor my head is ringing
All the words you said are stinging
Courage to the bone but then you say that you cannot remember
I'm no match to wanna fight you
Everything I say ignites you
Try to let it lie but then I find that you will not surrender
Held down by the devil's hand
Dressed up like a gentleman
You got me crying on every time
There must be something wrong
Lights on in the middle of the night
If I give a little more will it make it right
You know I'm trying, in the end
There must be something wrong
There must be something wrong (what's wrong with being wrong)
There must be something wrong (what's wrong with being wrong)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Held down by the devil's hand
Dressed up like a gentleman
You got me crying on every time
There must be something wrong
Lights on in the middle of the night
If I give a little more will it make it right
You know I'm trying in the end
There must be something wrong
I'm taking the devil's hand
He's been such a gentleman
He's got me crying on every time
There must be something wrong
Lights on in the middle of the night
If I give a little more will it make it right
You know I'm trying in the end
There must be something wrong
There must be something wrong (what's wrong with being wrong)
(what's wrong with being wrong)
There must be something wrong (what's wrong with being wrong)
(what's wrong with being wrong)
There must be something (what's wrong with being wrong)
(what's wrong with being wrong)
