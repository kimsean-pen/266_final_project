Shy kid, knees always bruised
The daddy's girl that because you
In the front seat you pulled me close
Kissed my lips, it tasted like home

Flashes of cross words and camomile
The years pass like a ferris wheel
Tiny fractures in the form
The days we live so much more

We got a little place near the beach
We watch the sailboats out a sea
And we ride along the Palisades
Love is just a summer day

If you hold too tight it starts to fade
Let it go then, then it floats away
In time will you remember me
For a second we had everything

Half awake and sunburned...
Searching vines of summer...
Aimless and upwards...
