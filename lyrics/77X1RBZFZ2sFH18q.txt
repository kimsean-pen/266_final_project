So you found out today
You're life's not the same
Not quite as perfect
As it was yesterday
When you were just
Getting in the groove
Now you're faced with something new
And I know it hurts
And I know you feel torn
But you never gave up
This easily before
So why do you choose today
To give it all away

Well it's not so bad y'all
Together we all fall
Just as long as we get up
We'll stand tall
We shouldn't waste another day
Thinking 'bout the things
That we forgot to say
I'm hitting back y'all
I'm kicking these four walls
Just as hard as I can
Till I can't crawl
I won't waste another day
With all these silly things

Swimming in my brain

There's no giving up now
Do you really wanna give this all away?
Can't you ever see things in a different way somedays...
Such a beautiful thing to throw away
You should think things through
Over and over again

All over again

So your scars fade away
You soaked up the pain
A better person 'cause you
Lived through those days
And now you know what it's like to prove
You can overcome anything that gets to you
Well it's alright
We're saying our goodbyes
To the past and everything that ain't right

We won't waste another day
With all these silly things in our way

There's no giving up now
Do you really wanna give this all away?
Can't you ever see things in a different way somedays...

Such a beautiful thing to throw away
You should think things through
Before you give it up now

I know we have given
All that we can give
When there's nothing to lean on
Well, I'd remember this

All we make of this lifetime
Is always here within
And remembering that's why
We should never give in

Do you really wanna give this all away?
Can't you ever see things in a different way somedays...
Such a beautiful thing to throw away
You should think things through
Over and over again
All over again
There's no giving up now!
