Step into my fractured fairytale
It is magical but dark as well
But stars cannot shine without darkness
There lies beauty within darkness
Dream away with me
To a world of dark creation
Leave reality
To my imagination
Step into my gothic novel
It is romantic but also awful
But passion grows even when you're heartless
Dream away with me
To a world of dark creation
Leave reality
To my imagination
Dream away with me
To a world of dark creation
Leave reality
To my imagination
Be my beautiful disaster
My tragedy ever after
My happily happily tragedy
My happily ever after
Dream away with me
To a world of dark creation
Leave reality
To my imagination
Fly away with me
Spread your webby wings
Dream away with me
To a world of dark creation
And leave reality
To my imagination
