Placed behind door number 3
I lay (shaking) will he pick me?
Don't be alarmed or misinterpret
For it's his anonymity that put me here
I should decide whether it's the dopamine
Or someone hitting "refresh" on my spine-al Cord is aching as if the earth
Like me's, been shaking, shaken up.

Door number 3 has opened up
And like that the world pounces on the knobs of one and two
"If we can't have it all, then why have anything at all?"
They chant,
Their song sending shivers up and down,
Around my spinal cord is aching as if
The earth like me's been shaking, shaken up
And out into the place we know will give the verdict:
Them finding that there's something in the water.
But I can't seem to put my glass down
Maybe because soon I'll be inside
Drowning in its confines
Pounding on the glass like I were five.

I can't remember what it was I felt
Or heard, or saw, or touched after hearing the word "hello".
Dancing figures, intimate, I know
But there was more involved that made me
Believe that there were two of them and only one of me.
It gets harder to see them as the water rises.
As I criticize it, it's his eye
It fills the glass
It's all that I could ask for he is drowning in the same room as me
And it's the very thing that makes me believe that there are two of him and only one of me.
Let me drown amidst my ignorance as if I were asleep
