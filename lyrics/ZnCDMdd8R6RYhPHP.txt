DINAH
Back off girls - he's mine.
GREASEBALL
Here comes the diesel train
With its steel refrain,
Hear me knocking.
The diesel's on its way,
It's gonna win the day,
Hear me knocking.
Listen to the chatter of the diesel force,
Generating twenty seven hundred horse,
Camshaft rolling while the rockers rock,
Hear me knock.
See me hustle,
Feel my muscle,
Pumping Iron.
Trying to build my body,
Trying to lose my mind.
See me straining,
I'm in training,
Pumping Iron.
I'm a diesel engine,
I'm knocking, I'm knocking, I'm knocking,
I'm Pumping Iron.
COACHES
Well he's the one they'll choose,
You know he just can't lose,
Hear him knocking.
There ain't another rig
That's even half as big,
Hear him knocking.
Everybody's gonna say "that train is smart",
The mighty diesel engine is a work of art.
The undisputed leader of the Rolling Stock,
GREASEBALL
See me knock.
GREASEBALL AND COACHES
See me hustle,
Feel my muscle,
Pumping Iron.
Stretching my bullworker,
I'm heaving on my weights.
See my flex my delts and pecs - I'm
Pumping Iron.
I'm a diesel engine,
Hey, I'm knocking, you know I'm knocking, said I'm knocking hey-
Heading for the rally (heading for the rally)
Gonna win the first race (gonna win the first race)
I'm gonna run the longest (the biggest and the strongest)
I'm knocking, said I'm knocking, you know I'm knocking.
Well - I'm so beautiful -
I'm PUMPING IRON!
