When leopards
Say they can change
They don't mean a single word
That they say

No

Because leopards
Promise the earth
For all they're worth, swear blind
They feel the same

Making the same mistakes
As long as they realise
That's all they can do (Promise)
That they're going to keep trying too

Join the spots (Dot to dot)
Revealed the hidden picture
Now comes clearly into view (Hey it's you!)
Cross your heart (Hope to die)
Should they ever tell a lie
Oh my, oh my

Join the spots (Dot to dot)
Revealed the hidden picture now
Comes clearly into view (Hey it's me too!)
Cross our hearts (Hope to die)
Should we ever tell a lie

Oh my, oh my
As long as we realise
That's all we can do (Promise)
That we're going to keep on trying
(Be honest) Yes, that's the way that we'll pull through
If you try, I promise I will keep trying... too

Hey leopard
What do you say leopard?
