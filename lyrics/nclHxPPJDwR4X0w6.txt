The steel that sleeps the eye
Needs nor tax nor toll
The kings with men might lie
Swollen and haloed

Her sweetest skin burns

Now I've buried all the gold beneath my hide
Now I'll swallow breath with blood

Of pole and anchor
Of stone and mitre
God and beast and
Wine and fish and man

The virgin ground stains

Now we've wandered through the polestar's dusty floe
And my crown is breath and blood
