You're strutting into town, like you're slinging a gun
Just a small town dude, with a big city attitude
Honey are you looking for some trouble tonight
Well alright
You think you're so bad, drive the women folk wild
Shoot 'em all down with a flash of your pearly smile
Honey but you met your match tonight
Well that's right

You think you'll knock me off my feet till I'm flat on the floor
Till my heart is crying Indian and I'm begging for more
So come on baby

Come on baby

Come on baby show me what that loaded gun is for
If you can give it I can take it
'Cause if this heart is gonna break, it's gonna take a lot to break it
'Cause I know tonight, somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough, come on and prove it

Your heart is down for the count and you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames

Just like Jesse James ...
You're an outlaw lover and I'm after your hide
Well you ain't so strong, won't be long till your hands are tied
Tonight I'm gonna take you in dead or alive
That's right

You break the laws of love in the name of desire
Take ten steps back, 'cause I'm ready baby, aim and fire
Baby there's nowhere you're gonna run tonight

Ooh that's right
Well you've had your way with love, but it's the end of the day
Now a team of wild horses couldn't drag your heart away
So come on baby

Come on baby

Come on baby you know there ain't nothing left to say
If you can give it I can take it
'Cause if this heart is gonna break, it's gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight, somebody's gonna win the fight

So if you're so tough, come on and prove it

Your heart is down for the count, and you know you'll gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James ...
You can knock me off my feet, till I'm flat on the floor

Till my heart is crying Indian, and I'm begging for more
So come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on
If you can give it I can take it
'Cause if this heart is gonna break, it's gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight, somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough, come on and prove it
Your heart is down for the count, and you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James
I'm gonna shoot you down Jesse James.
