Thousand lights passing by
Stories floating around
Silence is long gone by now
All the wishes we had
Dreams that we shared

I remember the time
Closing down open doors
Making fences grow strong
Burning the plants that I've grown
Deep inside from the time
When love was our life
Now it's goodbye

All of the lies
Just passing us by
I'm holding to keep it inside
Why no wrong can't be right
All the wonders are gone
No more flowers will fall tonight
All of the lies
Just passing us by

Threads of life going by
Precious moments run by
Tossing and turning our minds
All the magic is gone
No more feelings of hope

Will we ever forgive
Will the wounds start to heal
I'm tired of pushing the day
Putting down all behind - moving away

All of the lies
Just passing us by
I'm holding to keep it inside
Why no wrong can't be right
All the wonders are gone
No more flowers will fall tonight
All that is gone
Just passing us by

Lies
Just passing us by
I'm holding to keep it inside
Why no wrong can't be right
All the wonders are gone
No more flowers will fall tonight
All that is gone
Just passing us by
