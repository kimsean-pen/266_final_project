Save me
The heavens have opened
The storm is over
So let's start the parade
Raindrops
Will turn to laughter
Forever after
In your technicolor heartbeat
And they say
That it helps you forget everything...

Sweet charity
Sweet charity

You drink your poison from a cup of gold
Your gift keeps on giving and giving
Perfect photographs
Of Everest days
And postcard nights
Tearing through the paper walls of time
With sunset eyes
Telethons, Grand Canyon hearts
You numb your mind
With gloves of white and turpentine
Even the bombs and scarecrows will sing!

Sweet charity
Sweet charity
Sweet charity
Sweet charity

Save me
The heavens have opened
And I'm alone
Sweet charity
Save me
The heavens have opened
I'm coming home
Sweet charity
Save me
The asylums have opened
I'm coming home
Sweet charity
I'm home free...
