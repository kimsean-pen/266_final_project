Gods
Are raining down
They flood the town
With their holy water
Gods are everywhere
Pollute the air
With their everafter
Gods
They're all around
They're in the cloud
They're on my television
Gods
You can't escape
They'll do no fate
Always their next religion

And I don't understand why they want me
And I don't understand why they need me
Why I feel like a flaw in the system
Why I don't get a chance to resist them
And I don't understand how they got me
And I don't understand why they hold me
Please, oh god, nothing more I can give them
And I don't get a chance to resist them

Gods
They'll come for you
They're on the news
Front, back and center pages
Gods
I will pray
They're on the chase
They put our kids in cages

And I don't understand why they want me
And I don't understand why they need me
Why I feel like a flaw in the system
Why I don't get a chance to resist them
And I don't understand how they got me
And I don't understand why they hold me
Please, oh god, nothing more I can give them
And I don't get a chance to resist them

And I don't understand why they want me
And I don't understand why they need me
Why I feel like a flaw in the system
Why I don't get a chance to resist them
And I don't understand how they got me
And I don't understand why they hold me
Please, oh god, nothing more I can give them
And I don't get a chance to resist them
