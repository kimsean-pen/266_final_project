(Time to break through the anger
Look for the remains of the everlasting me)

Incinerating hands that touched your graceful face
In the mysterious ways
These scorching scars are last the everlasting visual drains
Never minding, and rewinding

(Time to break through the anger
Look for the remains of the everlasting me)

Cherish your hunger for resentment and dismay
And then come out to play
Cascading colors, meticulously I'll wash away
Time for choosing, not for losing

Defying the fire reviving within

Time to break through
Your walls are soaring high
They are disarranging the surface
And we're tripping in our own lie

(Time to break through the anger
Look for the remains of the everlasting me)

Your wish for virtual perfection seems in vain
It's trying to evolve
Your paragon possessed your inner self to no avail
No more waiting, no depending

Defying the fire reviving within

Time to break through
Your walls are soaring high
They are disarranging the surface
And we're tripping in our own lie

Don't throw your life away
You know the sin

Watch your back
Now feel the heat
Look for the world
One more time
And now can't you see with open eyes
All of us are incomplete?

It's time to break through
Your walls are soaring high
You can even try to break through
A perfect state of mind
And now you break through
You reach beyond the sky
You should never, ever burn out
The surface is made of light

(Time to break through the anger
Look for the remains of the everlasting me)
