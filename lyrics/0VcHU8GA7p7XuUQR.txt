Come on without
Come on within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
Come on without
Come on within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

Everybody's building
Ships and boats
Some are building monuments
Others dummy pound notes
Everybody's in dispair
Every girl and boy
But when Quinn the eskimo gets here
Everybody's gonna jump for joy

Come on without
Come on within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

I like to go just like the rest
I like my sugar sweet
But jumping queues and making haste
Just ain't my cup of meat
Everyone's beneath the trees
Feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the eskimo gets here
All the pigeons gonna run to him

Come on without
Come on within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
Come on without
Come on within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

Let me do what I wanna do
I can't decide on my own
Just tell me where to put 'em
And I'll tell you who to call
Nobody can get no sleep
Cause there's someone on everyones toes
But when Quinn the eskimo gets here
Everybody's gonna wanna doze

Come on without
Come on within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
Come on without
Come on within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
