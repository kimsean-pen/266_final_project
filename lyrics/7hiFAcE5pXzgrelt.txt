I've grown indifferent, sideways,
Like I've seen you before.
(Wake Up!) The clock strikes twelve.
Can your hear the bells, these
Hearts kiss and tell!

(Fall short! Conform!)

Can't talk to your way out of anything.

Mindless, like I've been here before.
(These words) are irrelevant.
You don't intimidate, you don't incorporate, you...

Load. Click. Shoot! OH MY GOD! 911
CALLING ALL CARS!

Never lay down, lay down... Lay down!
