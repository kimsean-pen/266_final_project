Can I, can I put in something like...
"This is "American Music"... take one." 1-2-3-4!
Do you like American music?
I like American music.
Don't you like American music, baby?

I want you to hold me, I want your arms around me.
I want you to hold me, baby...
Did you do too many drugs? I did too many drugs.
Did you do too many drugs, too, baby?

You were born too late, I was born too soon,
But every time I look at that ugly moon, it reminds me of you.
It reminds me of you... ooh-ooh-ooh.

I need a date to the prom, would you like to come along?
But nobody would go to the prom with me, baby...
They didn't like American music, they never heard American music.
They didn't know the music was in my soul, baby...

You were born too soon, I was born too late,
But every time I look at that ugly lake, it reminds me of me.
It reminds me of me...

Do you like American music? We like American music.
I like American music... Baby.
Do you like American music? We like all kinds of music.
But I like American music best... baby.

You were born too late, and I was born too late,
But every time I look at that ugly lake,
it reminds me of me...
it reminds me of me
it reminds me of me
