Death by chocolate is myth, yeah yeah
This I know because I did, oh
I've been around for broken hearts and how
Lay your head in my hands little girl, this is only right now
And death by crying doesn't exist, oh
Though the headaches feel a bit like it
You might explode but you reach the end of the road
And you little tree, I'm certain you will grow
Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again
Oh my weeping willow, let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling, the seasons are your friend
And death by anger this is true, oh
Just let him go, he can't hurt you, oh
Oh little girl, this is such a cruel, cruel world
This is the first of a million broken hearts
Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again
Oh my weeping willow, let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling, the seasons are your friend
Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong up, up and away
Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong up, up and away
Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong up, up and away
Oh, he's but a falling leaf
He's but a falling leaf, he's but a falling leaf
Yeah, he's but a falling leaf
He's but a falling leaf, he's but a falling leaf
