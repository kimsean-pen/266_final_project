Beryl,
was on another level
When she got her Booker medal*
She was dead in her grave
After all she gave
After all she gave
Beryl,
every time they'd overlook her
When they gave her, her Booker*
She was dead in her grave
After all she gave
After all she gave
It's all too late now
It's all too late now
It's too late to dabble it is all too late
It's too late to dabble it is all too late
Beryl,
the tobacco overtook her
When they gave her, her Booker*
She was dead in her grave
After all she gave
After all she gave
It's all too late now
It's all too late now
It's too late to dabble it is all too late
It's too late to dabble it is all too late
Beryl,
was on another level
When she got her Booker medal*
She was dead in her grave
After all she gave
After all she gave
After all she gave
After all she gave
Beryl
