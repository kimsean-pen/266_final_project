I'm back, I'm back, I'm back
Don't know how to act
What I got is what you lack
I give it up, you hold back
Stuck with the slack, I go and stack my stacks
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back
Rolling up the pack, party sound wack
Think I have to pass, park, I'm smoking gas
Mom jean on my ass
Get the last laugh 'cause my name you'll never drag
Miss me, boy, the best you ever had
Drawstring on my bag
Let the pants sag
Petty, never mad
Leave it in the past
If I dwell I'ma never have the life I worked hard for
The city to explore
The money come in more
Stuck in the crib, stuck in the crib
I'm a big little kid
I'm the bottle, the bib, the baby food lid
The nipple, the lid, and I did what I did
'Cause I live how I live (how I live, I live how I live)

For $2.50 I could go anywhere I want
Even if they check my bags
I'm hiding weed from the cops
I was on the six, green line chick
I was on the six

For $2.50 I could go anywhere I want
Even if they check my bags
I'm hiding weed from the cops
I was on the six, green line chick
I was on the six

For $2.50 I could go anywhere I want
Even if they check my bags
I'm hiding weed from the cops
I was on the six, green line chick
I was on the six

Fuck with the kid, you don't fuck with the kid
And I show ya my world and ya seen how I live
From the womb to the crib
And the crib to the school
And the school to the rave
And the rave to the games

Patsies for the eats
Casablancas for the meats
La Tropenzas for the bread
Went to Hajis got a philly cheese instead
Round the corner to Ollin 'cause you know I'm Mexican
Drink horchata with my peeps
Hug my auntie in the street

You could find me and jeff on the court
Playing ball, football, and track
And I still play them all even though that I'm wack

Pleasant Ave, Italianos, Glottis, and the Lucianos
Raos sitting on the corner, ever been inside
There's a guy at the table, eats fazul as he cry

For $2.50 I could go anywhere I want
Even if they check my bags
I'm hiding weed from the cops
I was on the six, green line chick
I was on the six

For $2.50 I could go anywhere I want
Even if they check my bags
I'm hiding weed from the cops
I was on the six, green line chick
I was on the six

For $2.50 I could go anywhere I want
Even if they check my bags
I'm hiding weed from the cops
I was on the six, green line chick
I was on the six
