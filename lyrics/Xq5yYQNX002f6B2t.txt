Girl you drive me crazy
Why you never come around
Why you never come around

Now you're such a lady
Why your feet don't touch the ground
Why your feet don't touch the ground

Tell me pretty baby
Say you'll never let me down
Say you'll never let me down

Autumn clearing
All the leaves are falling down
All the leaves are falling down

I can see you clearly now
