If you got Jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up

I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patrón
I want a girl on my lap and a Jägerbomb
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And I'mma make it rain on the girl who serves me
I'll drink a fifth of Vodka till it's gone
And if it feels so good, then it can't be wrong
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And we be taking shots, and if not, you're nerdy

We only leave a pre-party to go party some more
I'm already shitfaced before I walk in the door
This girl's rubbing on my leg, I've never met her before
And now she's making her way down to my gentleman's sword
It might be the drugs talking or the shots of Patrón
But these bitches look like models, and they're ready to bone
I'll take 'em back to my parents' house, we'll be Home Alone
I'll slap them chicks and have 'em yelling like Macaulay Culkin
She's tearing it up, yeah, she's dancing her ass off
This girl's like a Mac, the way she's riding my laptop
I'm trying to get my rocks off, so don't try to cock-block
Or I'll grab my sawed-off, and I'll blow your cock off
You know we drink so much, we getting drunk for weeks
We drink so much Goose, we turning into geese
Me and my crew fly the V through VIP
These bitches play my skin flute like they're Kenny G

I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patrón
I want a girl on my lap and a Jägerbomb
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And I'mma make it rain on the girl who serves me
I'll drink a fifth of Vodka till it's gone
And if it feels so good, then it can't be wrong
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And we be taking shots, and if not, you're nerdy

If you got Jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up
If you had too much, don't throw it up
And if you ain't got shit, throw your hands up

Get gone with it, there's nothing wrong with it
Take shots, don't stop, sing along with it
I wanna feel you bounce, girl, go up and down
Take shots, won't stop till I'm passing out
So girl, get down, you can have more
And you can shake your hips around on my man sword
You're gonna have to rock this house, I'm your landlord
So let your sweat drip down on the dance floor
I ain't trying to go home with nolla, nolla
We can hit the dance floor when you wanna, wanna
Girl, you know you're feeling me so holla, holla
'Cause everyone compared to me is nada, nada
Okay, dawg, this has gone on for way long
Can't quit my day job till I'm played on K-ROQ
It's chaos, I'm in the club with my shades on
And I'm about to Smack That like I'm Akon

I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patrón
I want a girl on my lap and a Jägerbomb
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And I'mma make it rain on the girl who serves me
I'll drink a fifth of Vodka till it's gone
And if it feels so good, then it can't be wrong
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And we be taking shots, and if not, you're nerdy

If you got Jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up
If you had too much, don't throw it up
And if you ain't got shit, throw your hands up
If you got Jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up
If you had too much, don't throw it up
And if you ain't got shit, throw your hands up

I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patrón
I want a girl on my lap and a Jägerbomb
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And I'mma make it rain on the girl who serves me
I'll drink a fifth of Vodka till it's gone
And if it feels so good, then it can't be wrong
I'm coming in hot, you heard me

If you got Jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up
If you got Jack in your cup, go raise it up
