Luminescent stains of the wasp splayed so yellow and benign
Never had a fighting chance
The true definition of a sad state of affairs
Pregnant with hope
A fever running hot against the wind
Only to end up
Painted thin against the glass against the frame
Feeling aimless to an end

I hope this glance is a trigger for you
An urge with couldn't subside
Refletion of every seedy desire
Cannonading through placid eyes

The first venture
A meddling tepid toe dip towards a pulse
Seeking danger seemed so modest
We lost sight as the tensions thickened
Aquiescing to carnal thought
Each furtive letter a crumbling brick
Peeled back the wings of the crippled insect
Blindly shattered in one fell swoop
This hand grenade detonates with the pinpull of truth

I hope this glance is a trigger for you
An urge with couldn't subside
Refletion of every seedy desire
Cannonading through placid eyes
This is a trigger
This is despair
These eyes are poision
A sad state of affairs
(Nothing ends well with a start like this)
