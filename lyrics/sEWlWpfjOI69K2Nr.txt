You want me, it's changing
You want, everything's changing
You want, sky would open up
You want, eyes could open up

Mess, worst, best, heard

Come so far, close together
Don't tear apart what we have worked for

Right or wrong, here we are
I wanna know what you are
What you are

Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, don't you go
I'll head out the fences
Head out the door

Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, don't you go
I'll head out the fences
Head out the door

I don't know what you want
But I got

Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, don't you go
I'll head out the fences
Head out the door

Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, don't you go
I'll roll with the punches
Roll out the door
