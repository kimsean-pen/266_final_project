And though I have these scars
I hold no grudges, it's my destiny
I got so used to winning
And now I do my best baby
To take it on the chin

I've made mistakes
But I'm not haunted
Because your love gives me the strength

Sometimes I lose my focus
And my core beliefs just overpower me
But the truth is I need others
To find the will
To find the point in anything
