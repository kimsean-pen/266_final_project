("What's that?")
("It's four, five, six, seven...")
You can't hear me.
You can't hear me.
You can't hear what I'm saying.
You can't hear what I'm saying to you.
You watch the clock
Move the slow hand.
I should have been home
Hours ago,
But I'm not here.
But I'm not here.
You can't hear me.
You can't hear me.
You can't feel me
Here in the room with you now.
You can't hear what I'm saying.
You don't hear what I'm saying, do you?
Can't let you know
What's been happening.
There's a ghost in our home,
Just Watching You Without Me.
I'm not here.
("You don't hear me.") [backwards]
But I'm not here.
(You can't hear me.)
But I'm not here.
(You don't hear what I'm saying.)
"Don't ignore, don't ignore me,
Let me in, and don't be long"*
"Don't ignore, don't ignore me,
Let me in and don't be long"
"Don't ignore, don't ignore me,
Let me in and don't be long"
"We see you here." [backwards]
"We see you here."
"We see you here."
"We see you here."
"We see you here."
"We see you here."
"We see you here."
"We see you here."
You don't hear me come in.
"Help me, baby! Help me, baby! Talk to me! Listen to me,
listen to me! Talk to me! Help--"
("You can't hear me.") [backwards]
"Listen, baby! Listen to me, baby! Help me, help me, baby!
Talk to me! Talk to me! Please, baby, talk to me!"
("You can't hear me.") [backwards]
You won't hear me leaving.
