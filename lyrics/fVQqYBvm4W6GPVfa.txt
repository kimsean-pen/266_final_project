Turn it up all over
As high as it can get
Spray perfume on my sternum
It mixes with my sweat

All right, yeah
All right, yeah
All right, yeah
All right, yeah
Minimum medium
Maximum cool

Breathing hard
I'm sticky
I'm dancing in bare feet
I'm tongue-tied
I can't lie
All I can say is that I know I'm gonna get free

All right, yeah
All right, yeah
All right, yeah
All right, yeah
Minimum medium
Maximum cool

All through the night
Mosquitoes bite
How'd they get inside

Legs like silvery eels
Come on touch how it feels

All right, yeah
All right, yeah
All right, yeah
All right, yeah
Minimum medium
Maximum cool

The rhythm of the fan as it oscillates
But like even the hardest heart
This wave is gonna break

I'm butter
I'm melting
Next to the barbecue
Oh pour me
I'm a drink
I bet I taste really really really really good

All right, yeah
All right, yeah
All right, yeah
All right, yeah
Minimum medium
Maximum cool

All through the night
Trying to catch a breeze
Up on the roof
Down on my knees
