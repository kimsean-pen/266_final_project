Kissing in the hallway
Turn off all the lights
Fragments of a lost love
Dissolve into the night

And I'll never get this feeling out of my head
And I never wanna be the one you forget

Blood hits the pavement from your eyes
Under the streetlights
But I've got you
Your restless limbs are going wild
But come into mine
'Cause I've got you

Climb into the backseat
Sitting on each other's knees
Wanna be on repeat
Acting like real ladies

And I'll never get this feeling out of my head
And I never wanna be the one you forget

Blood hits the pavement from your eyes
Under the streetlights
But I got you
Your restless limbs are going wild
But come into mine
Cause I've got you

I (I got you)
I (I got you)

And I'll never get this feeling out of my head
And I never wanna be the one you forget

Blood hits the pavement from your eyes
Under the streetlights
But I've got you
Your restless limbs are going wild
But come into mine
Cause they've got you

I (Yes, they've got you)
I (Got you)
