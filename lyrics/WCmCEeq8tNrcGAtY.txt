Swing low, sweet cherry
Make it awful
It's your life, it's your party, it's so awful
Let's start a fire
Let's start a riot! Yeah, it's awful
It was punk

They know how to break all the girls like you
And they rob the souls of the girls like you
And they break the hearts of girls

Swing low, cherry, cherry

Like candy, he's so beautiful
He's so deep like dirty water
God, he's awful
You're lost, oh, where's your daddy? It's so awful

And they royalty rate all the girls like you
And they sell it out to the girls like you
To incorporate little girls

Hey, run away with the light
Run away its divine
Let's run away, yeah, tonight, and
We'll steal the light of the world

Swing low, sweet cherry, yeah, it's awful
You're gonna ripe for the picking, it's so awful
You've got your youth
Don't waste your money

I was punk!

With one song
If the world is so wrong yeah you take it all
With one song
Swing low, sweet cherry
Make it awful
Hey bought it all, just build a new one.
Make it beautiful, yeah
