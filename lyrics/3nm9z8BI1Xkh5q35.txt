Brownskin honey, said won't you creep into my bedroom?
You lookin' real good now, tell me what it do
I heard you got a girl though, what's it got to do with me?
Oh, she don't have to know
I'll meet you, quarter to three

You know my roommates ain't home
And its really cold outside
You know I hate bein' alone
Bet I'll get you right
You know my roommates ain't home
And its really cold outside
You know I hate bein' alone
Bet I'll get you right

You pull the back of my hair, you rock my body out
We had a little affair upon daddy's couch
I ripped ripped yo pants, there's no keepin' it down
I worked you worked you real good, you turn my monster out
And if you got a problem I'll be the one to solve it
Be the one to solve it, be the one to solve it

Cause my roommates ain't home
And its really cold outside
You know I hate bein' alone
Bet I'll get you right
Roommates ain't home
And its really cold
