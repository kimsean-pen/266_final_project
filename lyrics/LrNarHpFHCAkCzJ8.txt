Won't you stop, take a breath
Find a moment to reflect
On the pure and simple choices

That we fail to see
From the worst to the best
From the East Coast to the West

On an never ending quest
To end our misery

So cut to the chase, it's time to escape
Before it's too late
Yeah, pick up the pace and catch up with fate
It's slipping away
So get off my road, no, I won't be told

'Cause I got my own
Definition of destiny
Yeah, take back control, and don't let it go

The future's unknown
Definition of destiny

Punch the clock to a own
While our lives are put on hold

When did all our childhood dreams
Begin to disappear?
Well, a long time ago
We had passion, we had goals
Why is life so set in stone
It doesn't have to be?
So cut to the chase, it's time to escape

Before it's too late
Yeah, pick up the pace and catch up with fate
It's slipping away
So get off my road, no, I won't be told

'Cause I got my own

Yeah, take back control, and don't let it go
The future's unknown

So get off my road, no, I won't be told
'Cause I got my own
Definition of destiny
Yeah, take back control and don't let it go
The future's unknown
Along the way, we lost our way
So will you change?
Or stay the same
So in between, reality
And fantasy is destiny
So cut to the chase, it's time to escape
Before it's too late
Yeah, pick up the pace and catch up with fate
It's slipping away
So get off my road, no, I won't be told
'Cause I got my own
