You've been away for so long
You walked out on me
There's no communication
No letters for me
And I wish that I could break this chain of reaction
Turn my feelings into action
If I only had you here now

I could show you how
I could show you, I could show you how
I could show you how

No longer talking to me
No more do I see
The dream I had disappeared
Why couldn't you see?
And I wish that I could break this chain of reaction
Turn my feelings into action
If I only had you here now

I could show you how
I could show you how I love you
I could show you how

If I only had you here now

I could show you how
I could show you how I love you
I could show you how
I could show you how I love you
I could show you how
I could show you how
I could show you how
