Land only for this fate.
The skyline is not seen for many a day.
It feels as though we're never turning back here.
The land returns to the dust.

Is there any way to get this weight off my skin
And find another one?
Is there anyone to get this writing off the wall
And find a new one?
And find it...

And just like the wind blows into the great unknown,
We're on our way, we're on our way.
Moving west may bring us better days.
We're on our way, we're on our way.

Is there any way to get this weight off my skin
And find another one?
Is there anyone to get this writing off the wall
And find a new one?
And find it...
