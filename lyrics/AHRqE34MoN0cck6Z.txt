I know it's dark here, you know that I'm scared too
For some reason right now of everything but you
Right now you're all that I recognize

You know I came here when I needed your soft voice
I needed to hear something that sounded like an answer
And I wait here, and sometimes I get one

It's nothing I'll forget when the moon gets tired
You are stuck to me everyday
Believe in what I am because it's all I have today
And tomorrow who knows where we'll be

From here I can hardly see a thing
But I will follow anyone who brings me to you
For now, forever, for on and on and on

You know it starts here, outside waiting in the cold
Kiss me once in the snow, I swear it never gets old
And I will promise you I can make it warmer next year

You know I came here when I needed your soft voice
I needed to hear something that sounded like an answer
Now I stay here, and every day I get one

It's nothing I'll forget when the moon gets tired
You are stuck to me everyday
Believe in what I am because it's all I have today
And tomorrow who knows where we'll be

From here I can hardly see a thing
But I will follow anyone who brings me to you
For now, forever, for on and on and on

So go plug in your electric blanket
We can stay in 'till our southern summer wedding day
Go plug in your electric blanket
We can stay here
