Pagan baby, won't you walk with me?
Pagan baby, come on home with me
Pagan baby, take me for a ride
Roll me, baby, roll your big, brown eyes

Yeah, ooh

Pagan baby, make me make your name
Drive it, baby, drive your big love game, oh
Pagan baby, what you got I need
Don't be savin', spread your love on me

Aaah, ah, ha, ha
Mm-mm-mm

Pagan baby, now won't you rock with me?
Pagan baby, lay your love on me

Yes, ah, ah, yeah

Aaah

Ah, ah

Hey, hey

Aaah

Hey

Aah

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
