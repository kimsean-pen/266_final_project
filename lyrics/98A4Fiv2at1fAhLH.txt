Dark brown hair and eyelash
Reappear in a flash
Now's the only time I know

Early morning's greatest deed
What's forsaken, I do not need
There is water, there is snow

Settling down door and room
Keep it tidy, keep it like a home
Now's the only time I know

Come here, sparrow
Watch my hand
Black and blue seeds
That is what my hand can
Now's the only time I know

Do my hair, paint eyelash
Reappear in a flash
There is more I'd like to know

Nine-fifteen, then I'm done
Quiet front seat, then drive around
Through the water, through the snow
