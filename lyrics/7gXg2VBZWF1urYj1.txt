If I was to stand in a General Election
Would you tell me about your close inspection
And how I never stood for detection
Or would you take another man?
If I told you I had the solution to starvation
All the nations would be their own salvation
And those that lead us lead us not into temptation
Or they pick another man?

Sweetheart
It's affecting me
Sweetheart
It's so effective
Sweetheart
Do you detect in me
A sacred sweetheart

If I told you about my plan would you believe me?
This is my body, my blood, would you receive me?
Or would you be the first to deceive me
And take another man

If I told you that I'm not the man to worry
Would you believe me when I said I was really sorry?
Or would you rush off in a hurry to take another man?

Sweetheart
Disconnect from me
Sweetheart
You have got no respect for me
Sweetheart
It's affecting me
My sacred sweetheart

And when you're troubled and when you're ill
You know I'll help, I always will
And when you're troubled and really down
You know I'll always be around
And when you're troubled and really broke
There is hope, there's hope, there's hope

Sweetheart
It's affecting me
Sweetheart
You've got no respect for me
Sweetheart
It's so effective
My sacred sweetheart
Sweetheart
Disconnect
Sweetheart
It's so effective
Sweetheart
It's affecting me
My sacred sweetheart
Sweetheart
Sweetheart
Sweetheart
