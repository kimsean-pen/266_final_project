Oh oh... No no... All right

You like to be seen at every party at the Playboy Mansion
Fun... sad, I know I gotta draw the line
You wanna be in the flashes of light, holding me tight
With your phoney laugh, I guess you gotta be photographed

You can say it's real but I know where it's at

Just don't tell me that
You are gonna love me
I don't wanna hear it, baby
You don't have to tell me that it's gonna be your last lie
No baby, I won't go for that
Even if you did say you were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love
Just dont tell me that

You like to drive in my Jag and spend every dollar of my credit, baby
Guess what? Hit me with your golden eye
I guess you wanna be part of the ride, live for the night
But I've seen it through, I've had enough of being close to you

You can say it's real but I know where it's at

Just don't tell me that
You are gonna love me
I don't wanna hear it, baby
You don't have to tell me that it's gonna be your last lie
No baby, I won't go for that
Even if you did say you were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love
Just dont tell me that

No, no... It's not about love... No no

You wanna be in the flashes of light, holding me tight
Girl, it's all up to you
But whatever you do, I don't wanna hear it

You're not gonna love me
I won't go for that, it just won't happen
Even if you say, you were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love
Just don't tell me that
You are gonna love me
I don't wanna hear it, baby
You were gonna tell me that it's gonna be your last lie
No, no baby, I won't go for that
Even if you did say, you were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love
Just don't tell me that
