You were a business
I was a startup
You were like high speed
I was a dial up
I needed caffeine
You were a Starbucks
A Starbucks
(A double shot)
You were a record
I was a remix
You were the sunshine
I was a raincheck
You needed time, but
You were my Rolex,
My Rolex
(my rolley)
I couldn't get it right
'Till you opened up my eyes
You turned my whole world upside down.

Things are looking up
Things are looking up
I couldn't find the star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking up
(Even when I'm down)
Had about enough
(Looking at the ground)
I couldn't find the star in the sky
But now that I found us
Things are looking up
You were a diamond
I was a coal mine
You were a freeway
I was a stop sign
I was a paycheck
You're like a gold mine,
A gold mine
(Money, honey)
I couldn't get it right
'Till you opened up my eyes
You turned my whole world upside down.

I've been up and I've been down
Girl you make my whole world go 'round
There's nothing like the high I found
