I don't want to see your worth
Wrap it up, hide it away from me
No, I don't see that much at all these days
And I wonder if you're the same
I don't want to feel you out
Decipher every word out of your mouth
No, I don't feel that much at all these days
And I wonder if you're the same
Caught in a maze, unending
I wasn't there to be what you needed me to be
Under a weight, oppressing
I bent without a break, and you were a world away
I don't want to hear your voice
Cutting through all of the white noise
No, I don't hear that much at all these days
And I wonder why I'm this way?
Caught in a maze, unending
I wasn't there to be what you needed me to be
Under a weight, oppressing
I bent without a break, and you were a world away
I don't want to feel you out
Decipher every word out of your mouth
No, I don't feel that much at all these days
Just get away
I don't feel that much at all
I don't feel that much at all these days
I don't feel that much at all
I don't feel that much at all these days
I don't feel that much at all
No, I don't feel that much at all these days
