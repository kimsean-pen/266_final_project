A common line
I close my eyes
but couldn't let it go
the perfect time
I dropped my guard
and lost but won somehow

It's rather sad
it feels like we've never
made it together since

One word ahead
and you'd be dead
I held you in my throat
I stumble by
attached to you
I couldn't let it go

It's rather sad
it's really sad
it feels like we've never
made it together since

We'll never have the guts
to discover
we'll choke on it and die
