I'm gonna say what I need
If it's the last thing I do
I do, I do, I do
I'm in that kind of mood
I've thrown my hat in the ring
I've got nothing to lose
With you, with you, with you
I'm in that kind of mood

I'll go under your wing
I'll slot right in between the
Cracks between you and him
I don't wanna go home
Shall we drive from zone to zone
I wouldn't do this on my own
But I'm not on my own tonight

Oh, you're going to New York?
I'm going there
Why don't I come with you
Oh, you've changed to L.A.?
I'm going there, I could go there too

I'm gonna say what I need
If it's the last thing I do
I do, I do, I do
I'm in that kind of mood
I've thrown my hat in the ring
I've got nothing to lose
With you, with you, with you
I'm in that kind of mood

I'll go under your wing
I'll slow right in between the
Cracks between you and him
I don't wanna go home
Shall we drive from zone to zone
I wouldn't do this on my own
But I'm not on my own tonight

Oh, you're going to the brink?
I'm going there
Why don't I come with you
You don't care what they think
I'm getting there, I could get there too

I'm gonna say what I need
If it's the last thing I do
I do, I do, I do
I'm in that kind of mood
I've thrown my hat in the ring
I've got nothing to loose
With you, with you, with you
I'm in that kind of mood

I'll go under your wing
I'll slow right in between the
Cracks between you and him
I don't wanna go home
Shall we drive from zone to zone
I wouldn't do this on my own
But I'm not on my own tonight
