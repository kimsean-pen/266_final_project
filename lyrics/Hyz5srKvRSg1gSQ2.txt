There's a feeling in the air
Girl, I really wanna go
Cause I'm dreaming once again
And the meaning now I know

I love you yeah, I love you yeah
Everything is alright
I love you yeah, I love you yeah
But I want to be loved

Alex the kid in miracle land
Alex the kid in miracle land
Do anything when I think that I can
Alex the kid in miracle land

Now I'm leaving here today
With the music in my head
To a secret place
To remember what I said

I love you yeah, I love you yeah
Everything is alright
I love you yeah, I love you yeah
But I'm going out?

Alex the kid in miracle land
Alex the kid in miracle land
Do anything and sing anything
Oh...

Alex the kid in miracle land
Alex the kid in miracle land
Do anything and know who I am
Alex the kid in miracle land.
