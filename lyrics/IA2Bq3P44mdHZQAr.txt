Kicking off is the hardest part
Nothing's certain at the start
Letting go, so something can begin
Figure out how to get a life
Leave tomorrow, live tonight
Gotta throw, throw your heart right in

Cause we all fall down

Everybody knows the end
When the curtain hits the floor
Everybody knows the end
Don't wanna get there wishing that you'd given more
It's not over, till it's over
So how do we begin?
When everybody knows the end

I need to live with nothing fixed
Don't tell me what's gonna happen next
I'm alright, I like the way this feels
Leave behind all the things I miss
The next stop isn't where you think it is
Cause tonight I'm riding off the rails

Cause we all fall down

Everybody knows the end
When the curtain hits the floor
Everybody knows the end
Don't wanna get there wishing that you'd given more
It's not over, till it's over
So how do we begin?
When everybody knows.

The end is were you hope you never say
"I coulda done it better"
I'm gonna keeps what counts
& throw away what doesn't really matter
& I wanna die (& I wanna die)
On the highest high (On the highest high)

It's not over (it's not over)
till it's over
I wanna stay here forever

Cause we all fall down

Everybody knows the end
When the curtain hits the floor
Everybody knows the end
Don't wanna get there wishing that you'd given more
It's not over, till it's over
So how do we begin?
When everybody knows the end

Everybody knows the end
Everybody knows the end
