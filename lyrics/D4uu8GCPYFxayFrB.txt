I grew up by the sea
I played under the sun
Come to me, come into my dreams
This is my light of life

Between the bluebells
Sits a girl with blond braids
A blue-eyed angel
With strawberry cheeks

The spell has bound me
I was living a dream
Norwegian homeland
My heart belongs to you

The spell has bound me
I was living a dream
Norwegian homeland
My heart belongs to you

I climbed mountains so high
I discovered the deep
Long to be long, to be part of this dream
This is where my heart beats

Between the bluebells
Sits a girl with blond braids
A blue-eyed angel
With strawberry cheeks

The spell has bound me
I was living a dream
Norwegian homeland
My heart belongs to you

The spell has bound me
I was living a dream
Norwegian homeland
My heart belongs to you

Between the bluebells
Sits a girl with blond braids
A blue-eyed angel
With strawberry cheeks

The spell has bound me
I was living a dream
Norwegian homeland
My heart belongs to you

The spell has bound me
I was living a dream
Norwegian homeland
My heart belongs to you
