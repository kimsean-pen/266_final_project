Strange love
even though you hurt me I feel
blessed love
baby I'm your puppet
on a string
making me tumble and swing
trouble's what you bring
strange love
strange love

strange how
you control my every little
move now
hanging from your strings
is all I know
starring in your puppet show
never let me go
strange love

all the things
you've said and done
there's no space
for me to run
baby I've lost and you have won
cause' all I really want is

strange love
even though you hurt me I feel
blessed love
baby I'm your puppet
on a string
making me tumble and swing
trouble's what you bring
strange love
strange love
strange how
