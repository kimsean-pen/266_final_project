I wanna dedicate this song
To all the women, all over the world
That have to still deal with this issue
You know I've been there too I had to deal with it with you
But come on now ladies how many times he got to say
Her name? Listen

You came home late last night
You smelled just like the scent of her
Not only that but you had lipstick all over your shirt
I'm thinking to myself this man has no respect for me
I knew it all along 'coz you were talking in your sleep

It's a wrap
Why you gonna do me like that?
I thought the love was good
But I misunderstood, baby

It's a wrap
And I am not surprised
How you could sit right here?
And look me in my eyes and tell a lie

I heard you call her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do?
'Coz I'm through with you

I heard you call her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do?
'Coz I'm through with you
I heard you

What you were sayin' in your sleep it violated me
No doubt about it but theres nothing left for you and me
Because your busted and I might as well go on
Boy it's gonna take a long time to make this a happy home
You know

It's a wrap
Why you gonna do me like that?
I thought the love was good
But I misunderstood, baby

It's a wrap
And I am not surprised
How you could sit right here?
And look me in my eyes and tell a lie

I heard you calling her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do?
'Coz I'm through with you

I heard you calling her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do?
'Coz I'm through with you
I heard you

All you had to say is I don't wanna be with you but
Why don't you tell the truth? 'Coz I already got the proof
And it'll never be the same you know it's a kinda shame
Because now I am disgusted but you are so corrusted

I heard you calling her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do?
'Coz I'm through with you

I heard you calling her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do?
'Coz I'm through with you

I heard you calling her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do?
'Coz I'm through with you

I heard you calling her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do?
'Coz I'm through with you
I heard you

Why you gonna do me like that?
I thought the love was good
But I misunderstood, baby

It's a wrap
And I am not surprised
How you could sit right here?
And look me in my eyes and tell a lie
