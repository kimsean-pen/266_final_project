Cow-skin cowboy boots donned, but you aren't from Texas
Strawberry lemonade made, but you're not a child
And so you saved it, and you made it into an adult beverage
Called it "twin's twist"
'Cause it's the simple tricks that help you seem wild
Sure, it's the sugar surfacing on the sour
Masking a moment with a happiness hour

The lemon rind can reek in the summer heat
But then seem so sweet later on

Got that 'Chronic 2000'-high-school state of mind
Burning mom's gas, you're smashed
And it's fueling your rhymes about the 2-liter hits
That you get with a little help from gravity
The high keeps you on the ground
When your favorite one in town isn't around
Kissing other people and trying not to fall in love
Dancing in the darkness, but in the daytime, it's just a shrug

The lemon rind can reek in the summer heat
But then seem so sweet later on
Finding fruit to eat in February
Dreams of losing teeth in a month, so sleep off that one

Good morning, boring town
Buy your disguise for a dollar down
We're putting on your crown and singing you happy birthday
And force feeding you meringue

The lemon rind can reek in the summer heat
But then seem so sweet later on
Finding fruit to eat in February
Dreams of losing teeth in a month, so sleep off that one
