With you inside my palm
It's clearer
We're aching for them all

If you're afraid
I know
With you inside my bones
You're bigger

So until
I get it right
Still it was a wild ride

The night was always long
I see it
We're aching from the fall

When you're alone
You know
With me inside your bones
I'm near it

So until
I get it right
Still it was a wild ride

So until
I get it right
Still it was a wild ride

So until
I get it right
Still it was a wild ride

So until
I get it right
Still it was a wild ride

So until
I get it right
Still it was a wild ride
