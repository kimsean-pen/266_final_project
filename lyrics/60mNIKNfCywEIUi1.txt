Wish I didn't know
Wish I didn't know, oh
Wish I didn't know
Wish I didn't know, oh

Wish I didn't know
I didn't know
I didn't know, know, know, know

I've never ever had someone I could call the one
Nobody's ever moved me quiet the way you've done
Why would I ever think of you not by my side
Impossible to picture you not in my life

So why am I sad here, wiping away these tears?
And why am I lying, trying to unveil this fear?

Seeing the laughter in your eyes
Seeing the smile I thought was mine
Watching you kiss her lips goodbye
Things I wish I didn't know

If I could wipe this memory
Go back to when that girl was me
The day that I should've stayed at home
And I wish I didn't know

Wish I didn't know
Wish I didn't know, oh
Wish I didn't know
Wish I didn't know, oh

Wish I didn't know
I didn't know
I didn't know, know, know, know

I'm lying here beside you, trying to block it out my mind
Just knowing that she touched you, kills a little more inside
Oh, I don't wanna confront you 'cause you're only gonna lie
But what's it gonna do, just sit around and watch love die?

So why am I sad here, wiping away these tears?
And why am I lying, trying to unveil this fear?

Seeing the laughter in your eyes
Seeing the smile I thought was mine
Watching you kiss her lips goodbye
Things I wish I didn't know

If I could wipe this memory
Go back to when that girl was me
The day that I should've stayed at home
And I wish I didn't know

Wish I didn't know
Wish I didn't know, oh
Wish I didn't know
Wish I didn't know, oh

Wish I didn't know
I didn't know
I didn't know, know, know, know

I've been busy denying
That my heart still needs to know

Seeing the laughter in your eyes
Seeing the smile I thought was mine
Watching you kiss her lips goodbye
Things I wish I didn't know

If I could wipe this memory
Go back to when that girl was me
The day that I should've stayed at home
And I wish I didn't know

Wish I didn't know
Wish I didn't know, oh
Wish I didn't know
Wish I didn't know, oh

Wish I didn't know
I didn't know
I didn't know, know, know, know

Wish I didn't know
Wish I didn't know, oh
Wish I didn't know
Wish I didn't know, oh

Wish I didn't know
I didn't know
I didn't know, know, know, know
