She said, ketamine don't mean a thing to me unless you love me
Yoy can suffocate on milk and honey
Wash it away, the air we breathis not some gift to me
It's always scarce each time we meet
And if you could hold me close
And feel this noose around your throat
Just look me one last time in the eye
Just to say goodbye
When you hold me close it's like being choked by a velvet rope
When you hold me close it's like being choked by a velvet rope
And you wanna survive? Well don't look me in the eyes
When you hold me close it's like being choked by a velvet rope
By a velvet rope
It's that look in your eyes as you
try to survive this wave of desolation
It's impossible to save them
Turn the knife on all the world, turn on every boy and girl
Watch the noose slip round your neck
As you close your eyes and draw a breath
And if you could hold me close
And feel this noose around your throat
Just look me one last time in the eye
Just to say goodbye
When you hold me close it's like being choked by a velvet rope
When you hold me close it's like being choked by a velvet
And you wanna survive? Well don't look me in the eyes
When you hold me close it's like being choked by a velvet rope
By a velvet rope
Into the arms of everyone you've ever loved
At the same time one last kiss from a million lips you once loved
As you drift and drift and drift away
Drift and drift and drift away, drift and drift and drift away
Drift away one last time
When you hold me close it's like being choked by a velvet
When you hold me close it's like being choked by a velvet rope
And you wanna survive? Well don't look me in the eyes
When you hold me close it's like being choked by a velvet rope
By a velvet rope
