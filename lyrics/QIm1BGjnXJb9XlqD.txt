Rockets

Oh when I look through the door of my lean-to

I don't know another lean room from my room
Should I pull up the floor of my kitchen
So I can feel the dirt while I'm doing all my dishes
To live in a house that is breathing
Is a luxury when you understand its meaning
But even in a box am I dreaming
Of a galaxy of stars above the ceiling
In my eye isn't understanding of what I see

It's hard to think about the time it takes
To get from space to me
And it may take a while
It may take a while when I never know where I should be
And then I start thinking, and I think and
Of the many dirty pennies and
Different motion
Mine'll be kind of sticky lately stuck inside the ocean
Oh, city grind

It's hard to sit myself down
And just think about the notion
Oh, I'm crying

Shouldn't I be content with what I've got
and not seek dimes?
Or am I denying myself it's

Something that I'd enjoy if I acquire
And I wonder if it's me who's just a thief
Taking the stash the stash that was in the grass

Digging a hole and digging it deep
And you'll dig for a while
Yeah, I'll dig for a while

Cause I'll never know when I plant the seed
And then I start thinking, and I think and
Of the many dirt pennies
It's going to be a good night tonight, it's going to be a fine day tomorrow
And if I have some kind of need
Maybe the thing I need is the thing I've got
And if I look inside of me
I'll find the thing that can't be took or bought
And I know that there are needy
Some are good, yeah but some are rotten
Why should I motivate my needs
When I know my greed should be forgotten
Is it alright if we feel good?
