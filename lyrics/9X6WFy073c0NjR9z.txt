A little bit just a little bit...

World's on turn around
Music make no sound
Where is sweetness found
When love is gone

Sun don't come around
Don't make a sound
Where can love be found
If your heart won't feel

Shivers
Up and down my spine
Breaker
Not on my mind

How could it end this way
Don't leave me, love me
Just a little bit longer

How could it end this way
Don't leave me, love me
Just a little bit longer

Day don't turn to Night
Morning don't bring light
Where is sweetness found
Where love is gone

Won't you stay tonight
Let the truth shine bright
Where can love be found
If your heart won't feel

Memories
Emotions that we share
Teardrops
Signing my face

How could it end this way
Don't leave me, love me
Just a little bit longer

How could it end this way
Don't leave me, love me
Just a little bit longer

How could end this way
