She's a long gone Demerol
She'll make you forget
Something about the time
The time she took you downtown
She's a long gone Demerol
She'll make you forget
Something about
Not living life
Her past times
In your room

Wandering to find the waterfall
That was shut behind an idle heart
God said, you know I'm so confused
That you'd let yourself fall apart
You want it more
For what it is
You're not alone
You should wait
Later on
Hate yourself
Hideaway
Life is hard
On everyone

She's a long gone Demerol
She'll make you forget
Something about the time
The time she took you downtown
Oh no, you can't remember it
You're hanging upside down
As a sun related offering
To the night time
To the night time
To the time
Violence and liars are a likely pair
When the pool is filled with empty air

Wandering to find the waterfall
That was shut behind an idle heart
God said, you know I'm so confused
That you'd let yourself fall apart
You want it more
For what it is
You're not alone
You should wait
Later on
Hate yourself
Hideaway
Life is hard
On everyone
