Get your money, keep fighting, go all in
I want to be your high when you're falling
Don't be stupid and feel like you want me
We can be one, don't fight it, just show me

Going in back and forth, the rain gon' drop
Going in back and forth, it ain't gon' stop
Going in back and forth, the rain gon' drop
Going in back and forth, it ain't gon' stop

Till the rain goes drop
Till the rain goes low (low)
Till the pain just drops
And there ain't no love

I want to be, be with you, no other
Argue with me, then make up like others (like others)
Queen of sorrow, I borrow your guidance
Till you get me, I hear you in silence

Going in back and forth, the rain gon' drop
Going in back and forth, it ain't gon' stop
Going in back and forth, the rain gon' drop
Going in back and forth, it ain't gon' stop

Till the rain goes drop
Till the rain goes low (low)
Till the pain just drops
And there ain't no love

Till the rain goes drop
We gonna fight till the rain
We gonna rise, push away all ourselves
We gonna ride till the pain goes back, yeah
Till the rain goes up and there ain't no fighting
