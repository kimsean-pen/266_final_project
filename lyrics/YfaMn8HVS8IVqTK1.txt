Time to die
Time to die

Time to die

Silhouetting, complicating
Whom to dare? I do not care
What is form and exploration
Everything is everywhere
Increase time and spin around it
Ready for another day
Power up and memorize it
Snap the mag and blow away.

Pin Eyed God
Get away
Pin Eyed God
Here to stay, yeah
Pin Eyed God
Break on you
Pin Eyed god
Coming free, yeah

Time to die
Time to die
Time to die
Time to die

I rejecting; back and building
Where you stare I do not care
What is crawling and competing
Everything is everywhere
Deep inside you get around it
Reaching back another day
Jump it up and feel the heat
You snap the mag and blow away.

Pin Eyed God
Get away
Pin Eyed God
Here to stay, yeah
Pin Eyed God
Break on you
Pin Eyed god
Coming free, yeah
