Traitor, hear the king's call in the night
Feel it piercing through your soul
From your heights now you must fall
And bow to the Wolf God
The Wolf

Tremble as the moon grows every night
Now it's shining like a dagger
In your eyes fall to your knees
And bow to the Wolf God
He's the Wolf
The Wolf God
He's the Wolf

Fools run as he slays all usurpers
Hiding in the night
Wolf God, reigning forever
Run, now he's free

The Wolf God
He's the Wolf
The Wolf God
He's the Wolf
The Wolf God
The Wolf
The Wolf God
The Wolf
