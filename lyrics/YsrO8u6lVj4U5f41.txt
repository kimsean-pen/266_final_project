We came together to honor an old friend
Lets talk about music good times
And those moments in between
It felt like they didn't matter
They'd go on forever played on repeat
We shared a heartbeat lets have one more

One more crucial moment
One more crucial moment

We came together to honor a dear friend
Your presence was bigger than anything i've ever seen
It felt like it didn't matter we'd go on forever
Played on repeat we shared a heartbeat
Lets have one more one more (One more)

One more crucial moment
One more crucial moment
One more round one more sound spin it round
One more crucial moment

These chords stick with me
This ink etched on me
These crucial moments played on repeat on and on
This beat it will be forever giving me
These crucial moments played on repeat on and on
On and on

One more crucial moment
One more crucial moment
One more round one more sound
Spin it round never coming down
One more crucial moment
One more crucial moment
One more crucial moment
One more round one more sound
Spin it round
One more crucial moment
