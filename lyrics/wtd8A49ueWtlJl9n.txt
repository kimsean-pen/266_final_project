Boys, now the times are changing
The going could get rough
Boys, would that ever cross your mind

Boys, are you contemplating
Moving out somewhere
Boys, will you ever find the time?

Here we are stranded
Somehow it seems the same, beware.
Here comes the quiet life again?

Boys, now the country's only miles away from here
Boys, do you recognise the signs?

Boys, when those driving hands push against the tracks
Boys, it's too late to wonder why

Here we are stranded
Somehow it seems the same, beware.
Here comes the quiet life again?

As you turn to leave
Never looking back
Will you think of me?
Will you ever, could it ever stop?
