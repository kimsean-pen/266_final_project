How could I ever know you?
When everything lies in disguise
How could I ever forget?
Those eyes looking for my weal

How could I ever know more?
When everything is held by threat
How could I ever feel you?
Once again, without losing my mind

Oh empty note
Shadows of my past
Made it to the end

Oh empty note
Shadows of my past
Made it to the end

How could I ever know you?
When you are miles and miles away
How could I forgive myself?
How blind and scared I was

Oh empty note
Shadows of my past
Made it to the end

Oh empty note
Shadows of my past
Made it to the end

Oh empty note
Shadows of my past
Made it to the end

Oh empty note
Shadows of my past
Made it to the end
