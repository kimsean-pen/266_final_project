The air in your lungs is like thunder
I can see the clouds breaking in front of me
And it won't be much keeping us under
But I don't ever wanna go back
To where I used to be

Now I know what I know
It won't have to be so -
You break the surface, take the wheel
No, no, no, no - no, nothing left for me to breathe
No, no, out of the blue you came to me
No, no, no, no, I can't believe, still can't believe

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Hear you come, my heart's only drummer
I've been holding out for your symphony

The air in my lungs is like thunder
And I can't fight what you've made of me

Now I know what I know
It won't have to be so heavy
You break the surface, take the wheel
No, no, no, no - no, nothing left for me to breathe

No, no, out of the blue you came to me
No, no, no, no, I can't believe, still can't believe
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Well, here it is, my last defense
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

I must send all of days ill spent
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Well, here it is, my last defense
No, no, no, no

No, no, no, no
The promises I never kept
You break the surface, take the wheel
No, no, no, no - no, nothing left for me to breathe
No, no, out of the blue you came to me
No, no, no, no, I can't believe, still can't believe
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Well, here it is, my last defense
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
I must send all of days ill spent
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Well, here it is, my last defense
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
The promises I never kept
