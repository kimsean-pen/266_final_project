Found my way to the highway
I don't wanna tell you the state I'm in
I've had too much to smoke
Too much to drink, where have I been?

I feel like stars are getting closer
And the sky is closing in
And I don't know where to begin

We're all looking for something
To take away the pain

Me and you and my medication
(Making the best of it)
Love is just a chemical creation
(Will it be permanent?)
Synthetic sensation
Me, you and my medication

The way back to the right track
Maybe you can help me find the door
Is it too much to ask
Too much too fast, too much to ignore?

It feels like your body's getting closer
But you seem so far away
Medicine make it okay

We're all looking for someone
To take away the pain

Me and you and my medication
(Making the best of it)
Love is just a chemical creation
(Will it be permanent?)
Synthetic sensation
Me, you and my medication

So can you feel it? Do you feel it coming down?
You gotta get up, can you get up off the ground?
Can you hear it? Can you hear me screaming?

So can you feel it? Do you feel it coming down?
You gotta get up, can you get up off the ground?
I wanna hear it, wanna hear you breathing
We're all addicted to something
That takes away the pain
Me and you and my medication
(Making the best of it)
Love is just a chemical creation
(Will it be permanent?)
Synthetic sensation
Me, you and my medication
