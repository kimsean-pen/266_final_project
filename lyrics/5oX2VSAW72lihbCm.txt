Oh, I am growing tired
Of allowing you to steal
Everything I have
You're making me feel

Like I was born to service you
But I am growing by the hour
You left us far behind
So we all discard our souls

And blaze through your skies
So unafraid to die
'Cause I was born to destroy you

And I am growing by the hour
And I'm getting strong in every way
Yeah, yeah

You led me on
You led me on
You
Oh, and I'm getting strong in every way
Yeah, yeah
