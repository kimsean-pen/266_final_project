The actress is always breaking things
The things you made she took you for
And I'm so tired I'd be lying
I hope the prarie buys you more
The fitness coast is growing near
The shores they don't stay blond this year
That's why the marblelawn stays clear and warm in time
I want to stay but my time is wasting
Magic lands call my name
They want to fire a missle launcher to the sky
I know I need to stay
And we all know that by staying here
It will be a good high this year
So what's the use of staying there
If you've got no use for time
The fitness coast is growing near
The shores they don't stay blond all year
The continent moves with growing fear
It's all for expensive lawn
I want to stay but my time is wasting
Magic lands call my name
They want to fire a missle launcher to the sky
I know I need to stay
I know I need to stay and fight the day
I know I need to stay and fight the day
I know I need to stay and fight the day
