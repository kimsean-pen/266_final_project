It's easy to forget that our days are numbered
It's easy for a slip to turn into a stumble
I didn't even feel when I took my eyes off you
I fell into my fear, and took a lie for a truth
Now I'm wondering around
Wondering without a clue
Can you remind me who I am
When I act like someone else
And can you help me understand
Why these cards were dealt
Can you shatter my mirror
To see outside myself
And I hope to see it clearer
The place from where I fell
I'm waiting for a sign
Waiting for direction
I'm ready to build a wall
Behind every step I've taken
So I can't turn back around
And doubt my destination
Can you remind me who I am
When I act like someone else
And can you help me understand
Why these cards were dealt
Can you shatter my mirror
To see outside myself
And I hope to see it clearer
The place from where I fell
Can you remind me who I am
When I act like someone else
And can you help me understand
Why these cards were dealt
Can you shatter my mirror
To see outside myself
And I hope to see it clearer
The place from where I fell
