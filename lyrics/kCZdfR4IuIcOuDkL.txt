Soak up the sound of the ageless whisper
Let buried memories form
The shadow of doubt
All those years when
Your senses would proliferate
You shut the doors but unleashed the hounds

You spoke the words of reason
You fired your instincts at will
You married the rain through the seasons
Of everlasting thrills

Still waiting for a call
As darkness shall befall
The one who never settles within

Do you remember choosing death
When we were young
We let the darker moments flourish
And kept our destiny shunned

And now there is nothing left from
When we used to run
In the valleys of our dreams
We'd already sold the sun

Two worlds colliding in a merciless winter
Wearily fires burning inside your soul
Imaginations thrusting your guidelines
And steals the light beyond control

You spoke the words of reason
You fired your instincts at will
You married the rain through the seasons
Of everlasting thrills

Still waiting for a call
As darkness shall befall
(As darkness shall befall)
The one who never settles within
(Settles within)

Do you remember choosing death
When we were young
We let the darker moments flourish
And kept our destiny shunned
Now there is nothing left from
When we used to run
In the valleys of our dreams
We'd already sold the sun

Do you remember choosing death
When we were young
We let the darker moments flourish
And kept our destiny shunned
Now there is nothing left from
When we used to run
In the valleys of our dreams
We'd already sold the sun
