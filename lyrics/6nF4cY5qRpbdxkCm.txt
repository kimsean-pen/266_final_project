The windmills of your mind
The windows in the night wide open
A jet black summer sky
A setback in my life, I'm hopeless
That glimmer in your eye
Like Paris in July
I notice, yeah
And the streets all come alive

I'm floating away
Over the car lights
I'm floating away
Glowing in starlight, yeah

My friends all wonder why
Yet no one takes the time
To ask me any questions
I read between the lines
Of symbols in the sky
I'm happy, any questions?
I leave this world behind
As I ascend a moonbeam pathway, yeah
And the streets all come alive

I'm floating away
Over the car lights
I'm floating away
Glowing in starlight
Time will not let me stay
Staying up all night, all night
Glowing in starlight, alright
Starjumper comes alive

Oh, there was dancing in the streets
Just like how we used to be
Faces smiling up at me
Now I'm free

I'm floating away
Over the car lights
I'm floating away
Glowing in starlight
Time will not let me stay
Staying up all night, all night
Glowing in starlight, alright
Starjumper comes alive

Staying up all night
All night, all night, yeah
Glowing in starlight, alright
Starjumper comes alive
