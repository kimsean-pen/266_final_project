Soft touch, warm skin
Nothing like my ex-man
Slowly falling, I don't want a next-man
I've never felt this way before
He never called me beautiful,
Like you do, like you do
Now I'm in uncharted water
Territory getting hotter
And I think I like it, I think I like it, 'cause

Only a girl
Knows how a girl feels
Only a girl
Can make me feel this way
It's getting better, nothing like two girls sticking together
Only a girl
Can make me say make me say
Oh ooh oh ooh ooh
Only a girl
Ooh ooh oh ooh oh
Only a girl

Dark eyes, pink lips
Now my heart is racing
Hot fingertips, don't know what I'm facing
Everything is new to me, I like what you do to me
Now it's you, only you
Now I'm in uncharted water
Territory getting hotter
And I think I like it, I think I like it, 'cause

Only a girl
Knows how a girl feels
Only a girl
Can make me feel this way
It's getting better, nothing like two girls sticking together
Only a girl
Can make me say make me say
Oh ooh ooh oh ooh
Only a girl
Ooh ooh oh ooh oh
Only a girl

And now I'm open like I've never been
I didn't know I need it
I love the way she treat it
Everything is happening
Only only, only

Only a girl
Knows how a girl feels
Only a girl
Can make me feel this way
It's getting better, nothing like two girls sticking together
Only a girl
Can make me say make me say
Oh ooh ooh oh ooh
Only a girl
Ooh ooh oh ooh oh
Only a girl
