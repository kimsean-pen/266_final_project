Oh Pamela what did you do
You touched the ground now i'm falling in love with you
Oh Pamela
What did they say?
I reached for your hand but you turned and walked away

Tell me what you wished to read about my main
Pamela
So annoyed but she loves her fella
One wink and a drink in the other one
At night she only wears Yves Saint Laurent
Watch black and white movies to get through
'cos her hair is just like Marilyn
Oh what an enigmatic woman
My touch just some through this album

Oh, Pamela what did you do
You touched the ground now i'm falling in love with you
Oh Pamela
What did they say?
I reached for your hand but you turned and walked away

Can you lend your ears for a man in trouble?
She told me up til now I see double
I asked her what her life was missing
and if she'd like to go trout mouth kissing
Said go get high with the other ones
I looked around like so, phenomenal
Oh what an enigmatic woman
My gosh this is so much better

Oh Pamela what did you do
You touched the ground now i'm falling in love with you
Oh Pamela
What did they say?
I reached for your hand but you turned and walked away

Oh Pamela what did you do
You touched the ground now i'm falling in love with you
Oh Pamela
What did they say?
I reached for your hand but you turned and walked away

You waled away...

Na, na, na na na
Na na, na, na na na na
Na, na, na na na
Na na, na, na na na

Take it away

Oh glad you have lemons in the morning
By noon her nurse comes calling
Limousine with the structure in the back
They strap her down, when she has a panic attack
I followed her down to the hospital
No visitors allowed on a bicycle
So I threw up sat at her window
I touched the glass so she could feel the wind blow

Oh Pamela what did you do
You touched the ground now i'm falling in love with you
Oh Pamela
What did they say?
I reached for your hand but you turned and walked away

Oh Pamela what did you do
You touched the ground now i'm falling in love with you
Oh Pamela
What did they say?
I reached for your hand but you turned and walked away

Walked away
Hey you walked away
Oh Pamela
Pamela
Walked away
