Your smile? so very happy
You look familiar
Reminds me of somethin' good
I once felt

Thinking something mellow
I dreamed of someone like you
Thinking something mellow
I dreamed of someone like you

Good times, good conversation

I look at myself
Maintained by the completion
Hm? of being stoned

I wanna thank you for being what I needed
I dreamed of someone like you
Thank you for being what I needed
I dreamed of someone like you

I dreamed of someone like you (repeat to end)
