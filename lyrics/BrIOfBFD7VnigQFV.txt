Well it was just me in my wooden room
But all I could see in it was just my own tune ball
How I needed some air, how I don't needed some care
But it was only me in my chair in my wooden room
I say

I keep spinning around where the first needs to last
I keep singing out loud if this is all that's past
A joker's son my coat's somewhere around town
I never won but I rest assure
That I can endure
The spinning (x4)

You did bring the fire to my wooden room
You did bring the flame to line it's gloom
How I sang

I keep spinning around where the first needs to last
I keep singing out loud if this is all that's past
A joker's son my coat's somewhere around town
I never won but I rest assure
That I can endure
The spinning (x4)

Hold up your flame in my wooden room (x8)
