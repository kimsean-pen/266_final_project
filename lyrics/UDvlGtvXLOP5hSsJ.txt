Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
I've never seem to get a lot

Take a jumbo across the water
Like to see America
See the girls in California
I'm hopin', it's going to come true
But there's not a lot, I can do

Could we have kippers for breakfast
Mummy dear, Mummy dear
They got to have 'em in Texas
'Cos everyone's a millionaire

I'm a winner, I'm a sinner
Do you want my autograph
I'm a loser, what a joker
I'm playing my jokes upon you
While there's nothin' better to do
Hey

Papararam pano daram no no no
Papararam pano daram no no no
Na na na nana na na na

Don't you look at my girlfriend
(Girlfriend)
She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
(Girlfriend)
I've never seem to get a lot
(What she got in another land)

Take a jumbo cross the water
Like to see America
See the girls in California
I'm hoping it's going to come true
But there's not a lot I can do

Hey
Papararam pano daram no no no
Papararam pano daram no no no
Hey aham
