This is the last take for the night
Understand it's kinda like
And I gotta get home to my son
'Cause he's so special to me

I mean I gotta see him, I need to breathe him
That's my baby, don't call me crazy
I love this studio but I love him more
Let me give you what I got so

I woke up in the morning feeling fresh to def
I'm so blessed, yes, yes
I went to sleep stressed, woke up refreshed
I'm so blessed, yeah, yes

Water in my face
And everything is in its place
Peace of mind, even my grace
I'm so blessed, yes, yes, yes

My grandma almost lived to see 92
I'm so blessed, yes, yes, yes, yes
My son was born healthy and beautiful
I'm so blessed, yeah, yes

My mama's on my right side, daddy on my left
My son father doing his absolute
I'm so blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
Yeah, yeah, yes

And I know what I know
And I know what I know
I know, yeah

Yeah, yes, trouble gon' happen
It's just the way it be
Ain't nothing coming easily in this life
Sometimes you gotta work
And you gotta fall and it gotta hurt
I'm sure you know, take a look around

Woke up this morning listening to this song
It's so blessed, yes, yes
Gonna rock this joint all night long
It's so blessed, yes

To be up in here with our hands up in the air
Waving like we just don't care
We're so blessed, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah

I woke up in the morning feeling fresh to def
I went to sleep stressed, woke up refreshed
My mama's on my right side, daddy on my left
I'm so blessed, yes, yes, yes
