I feel the anguish
I feel the hate
I feel your touch
It's getting late

Arbeit was machst du da
Arbeit was machst du da

I feel you presence
You're cold to me
Final inception
A trap for me

I am in your clutches
Just set me free
You drive a nail
Inside of me
This skill is yours
I feel this pain
You make this mortal insane

This could be the end of your life
This could be the end of your fight

I feel your breath
Your cold desire
I feel your hand
I feel the fire
No more control
In my mind
Final solution
We're driving blind

Arbeit was machst du da
Arbeit was machst du da

This could be the end of your life
This could be the end of your fight

No more communication
The lines are down
There's no resistance
They've all gone underground
Humanity is solvent
As warlords rule the Earth
Just one final message
Humans ruined the Earth
