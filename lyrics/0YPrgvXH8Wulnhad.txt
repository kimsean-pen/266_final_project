Oh, pull on the rein and haul me in
Back to the start where eyes first blink to see
A flowing mane a cut-glass limb
And they're falling soaring so rhythmically

Oh, pull on the rein and haul me in back to the start
Rebirthed in ecstasy with cherubim and seraphic
When I was falling soaring so rhythmically
Falling soaring falling for you so completely

The Rapture unfurling blues and greens
The Rapture a swirling violet stream
Mystic majestic entangled
In a web of curling vapor thread

Encaptured by forces unseen
Enraptured an eclipse intoxicating
Strangely not inside strangely not outside
Drowning in the middle of an eerie transition

And I don't know your name
Never been alive yet I haven't died
I hover disembodied in a semi-wakened haze
Floating far above the cloud, sinking far below the ground

Only my senses remain
The Rapture unfurling blues and greens
The Rapture a swirling violet stream
Mystic majestic entangled
In a web of iridescent curling vapor thread

Floating far above the cloud, sinking far below the ground
No form only my senses remain
Wondering if I dare to say your name
Wondrous thoughts embalmed a vow you came

By the crescent disc rising Amethyst
How can love remain the same unchanged?
Moonlight plays upon this sunken brow
Midnight ink bleeds wet mercurial clouds

By the crescent disc rising Amethyst
Somnambulist unharnessed storms the plough
By the crescent disc rising Amethyst
How can love remain the same unchained?
