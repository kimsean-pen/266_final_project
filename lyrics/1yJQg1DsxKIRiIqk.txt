I dont stand stand a chance againts the claw of answers
Fighting off your face across the pillow landscape
The list of things I feel is crazy amused
To me that i would need a second wake up
Its all that happening like their sayin like
And all we could fumble and fight
And what makes our love so hard to beat
Is it you, or is that you with me
But just a posibility, I have given anything
We played on me so much, only so much we cab tell ourselves
Is it you, or is that you with me
You like magnets, crowd of static
For everything is punishing but nothing happens
Scared to say it, even to yourself
And now, we could fumble to hell

And what makes our love so hard to beat
Is it you, or is that you with me
But just a posibility, I have given anything
We played on me so much, only so much we can tell ourselves
Is it you, or is that you with me
Coin of certain, and sad to think of
Expecting different outcome with the better question

Fear and comfort are the one the same
And now we could fumble away

And what makes our love so hard to beat
Is it you, or is that you with me
But just a posibility, I have given anything
We played on me so much, only so much we can tell ourselves
Is it you, or is that you with me
We played on me so much, only so much we can tell ourselves
Is it you, or is that you with me
You with me, you with me
You with me, you with me
Is it you, or is that you with me
You with me, you with me
