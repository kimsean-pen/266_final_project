Dead on the inside

Raised by wolves in sheep's clothes that abandoned me
But taught me to get up when I fall to my knees
Man makes monster, monster kills man
Taking your crown's always been part of the plan
If you weren't so stuck in your own head
You'd be where I am now instead

Nobody's gonna hear you
When you're calling for help, when you're calling for help
Nobody's gonna hear you
'Cause the sound of my screams are gonna drown you out
Drown you out

I've learned a lot, but it took me too long
To find out who I am and to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside?
Dead on the inside

If you want an enemy, I'll be the last one that you ever meet
But I can tell you now that you don't stand a goddamn chance against me

Nobody's gonna hear you
When you're calling for help, when you're calling for help
Nobody's gonna hear you
'Cause the sound of my screams are gonna drown you out

I've learned a lot, but it took me too long
To find out who I am and to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside?

Fuck that, fuck this; if you're gonna burn a bridge
You better hold your breath and learn to swim
Fuck that, fuck this; if you're gonna burn a bridge
You better hold your breath and learn to swim

I've learned a lot, but it took me too long
To find out who I am and to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside?
I've learned a lot, but it took me too long
To find out who I am and to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside?
Dead on the inside
Dead on the inside
