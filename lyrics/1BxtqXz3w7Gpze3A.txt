You're gonna lie to me anyway
You're gonna lie to me anyway
Charmer, charmer, charmer

You're gonna fight with me anyway
You're gonna fight with me anyway
Harder, harder, harder

And beg for more
Shout down the devil 'til your throat's red raw

I got my eye on you anyway
Got my eye on you anyway
Sharper, sharper, sharper

You don't know what the things I've done
You don't see where it gone wrong
Burn all the books you burned
Praying for you it never comes

Few tall tales and you go giddy
Me and my boys coming round look busy
Me and the boys got a lot we wanna change
And just like riding a bike
You're telling porkies, little piggy
Screamed down the market and cried all the way home
Don't be about when the boys get silly
Just like riding a bike

You're gonna lie to me anyway
You're gonna lie to me anyway
Charmer, charmer, charmer

You're gonna fight with me anyway
You're gonna fight with me anyway
Harder, harder, harder

And beg for more
Shout down the devil 'til your throat's red raw

I got my eye on you anyway
Got my eye on you anyway
Sharper, sharper, sharper

Who and the where and the when sounds iffy
Who and the where and the made all of it up
Calling you out I'm a traitorous hippy
Just like riding a bike
Just like riding a bike
Just like riding a bike

You're gonna lie to me anyway
You're gonna lie to me anyway
Charmer, charmer, charmer

You're gonna fight with me anyway
You're gonna fight with me anyway
Harder, harder, harder

And beg for more
Speak of the devil knocking down my door

I got my eye on you anyway
Got my eye on you anyway
Sharper, sharper, sharper

And you don't know the things I've done
You don't see where it gone wrong
Bury all the books you burned
Praying for you it never comes
I don't know what you've been told
And I won't guess what you been owed
See the truth between the code
Praying for you we save your soul
