One, two, three, four

Do I wanna be here?
Do I have to?
What a difference in life since last June
Grandma told me "slow down on the tattoos"
I'm just tryna make all my damn cash blue
And my baby walked out, said a mistake
Every god damn town, it's the same thing
I'm a fighter, don't know how to love
And maybe that will never change

Tomorrow's just another day
To wash all of these fears away
Thought's too loud, no words to say
Rest your eyes, you'll be okay

There's some people in my heart who've died
Drugs or to suicide
Think I'm 'bout to lose my mind
What's it mean to be alive?
What's it mean to pray to God?
Isn't that idea so odd?

I'm just a skeptic, don't know how to believe
And maybe that'll never change

Tomorrow's just another day
To wash all of these fears away
Thought's too loud, no words to say
Rest your eyes, you'll be okay
Rest your eyes, you'll be okay
