Going through the motions feels like drowning in the ocean
And I can't seem to get my feet back to ground
You're saying that you love me and how you're always thinking of me
But when you're near we're so disconnected now

I want that girl that I knew before to come right back and knock on my door

I know you're pretty cool and you've got a lot of friends
But I can be a pretty cool girl too
You say that I'm your number one but we both know that you have more fun
When you're running off with that older funner crew

I want that girl that I knew before to come right back and knock on my door

She's my best friend, but I'm not hers
Because she's got more than she had before
She's my best friend, but I'm not hers
Because she's got more than she had before
She's my best friend, but I'm not hers
Because she's got more than she had before

Every time you say hello it feels so fake and plastic
Babe you better know hearts aren't elastic
You say things will be better but you've been saying this forever
I don't want to wait because things won't change

I want that girl that I knew before to come right back and knock on my door

She's my best friend, but I'm not hers
Because she's got more than she had before
She's my best friend, but I'm not hers
Because she's got more than she had before
She's my best friend, but I'm not hers
Because she's got more than she had before

I want that girl that I knew before to come right back and knock on my door
