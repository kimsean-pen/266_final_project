We ride The Wild Sea
And if you want adventure,
It's the place to be
The sea wolves and the giant squids
Are coming up from The Wild Sea
And here's where I'll stay
For ten years and a day
We're on a quest to find hidden treasure
And mystery on The Wild Sea

Now the Sun she's shining for everyone
But we'll set sail and we'll be gone
We're sailing on
We're sailing on

Sailing on and on and on and on
Into the ocean, Into the sun
My boat, A Viking, My dad and me
On The Wild Sea
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la (x2)

Now we're taking on water
In the Dead Dog's Galley
A man overboard everyday
Captured by pirates
In the isle of donuts
Rescued by some maidens
Who then ran away
And here's where we'll be
We never know what we'll see
We can battle ghosts
On the bottom of the ocean
Or ride the waves
Of The Wild Sea

Now the Sun she's shining for everyone

But we'll set sail and we'll be gone
We're sailing on
We're sailing on

Sailing on and on and on and on
Into the ocean, Into the sun
My boat, A Viking, My dad and me
On The Wild Sea

Captain's Log: 1978
We've been on the sea now for over three years
And the unbelievable things we've found and seen,
No man can write.
Things like the discovery of the Purple Pearl of Pinoche,
The mysterious island of Bigfoot Women,
The SeaGhost in the Isle of Dread,
Pirates on the sea - pirates that no man can name -
The underwater bison family . . . and much more . . .

Sailing on and on and on and on
Into the ocean, Into the sun
My boat, A Viking, My dad and me
On The Wild Sea

Do you hear that son?
That's the voice of the Sirens calling from the sea.
Quick! Put some cloth in your ears!
Don't steer towards the island!

The Wild Sea is calling me
The Wild Sea is calling me
The Wild Sea is calling me
The Wild Sea is calling me
