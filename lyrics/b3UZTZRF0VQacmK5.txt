She wants to wipe her tears on my cold shoulder
I've tried but I can't keep on telling her it's over

She's been crying almost for three months
Stuck in bed, drinking red at home
All alone, all alone

But this shit it ain't my problem
He broke your heart, I'm sorry
But life ain't like no chocolate box
You got to quit acting so blue
And please stop dragging me down with you
Girl, go find somebody new

She talks for hours, says she'll never love again
I said you'll move on soon and forget this whole thing

But she's been crying almost for three months
Stuck in bed, drinking red at home
All alone, all alone

But this shit it ain't my problem
He broke your heart, I'm sorry
But life ain't like no chocolate box
You got to quit acting so blue
And please stop dragging me down with you
Girl, go find somebody new
