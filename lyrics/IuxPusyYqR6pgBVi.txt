Are you ready for a real good time my love
Are you ready for a really good treat
There'll be so much as it singing (...)
Are you the girl meant to me
So, do't be messing around
Don't be messing around
Don't be messing around

So, don't be messing around
Don't be messing around
Don't be messing around

Then we started (...)
We can say this little angel cloud
I'll be so proud if you'd let me know you girl
Let me love you for a little a while, my sweet

Don't be messing around
Don't be messing around
Don't be messing around

So, don't be messing around
Don't be messing around
Don't be messing around

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

Now she's started to bring a problem to the beat
I said let's move out on the plan

She said to keep your mind on lesson
Won't be no more messin'
No, No, don't mess with me, are we clear

Don't be messing around
Don't be messing around
Don't be messing around

So, don't be messing around
Don't be messing around
Don't be messing around

Da-na-na-na-na...
Pa-pa-ra-pa-ra...

So, don't be messing around
Don't be messing around
Don't be messing around

So, don't be messing around
Don't be messing around
Don't be messing around

So, don't be messing around
Don't be messing around
Don't be messing around

So, don't be messing around
Don't be messing around
Don't be messing around
