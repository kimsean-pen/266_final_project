Make you love me again (love me again, love me again)
Make you love me again (love me again, love me again)

Fifty girls at the door
And they all wanna roll, wanna roll, but I gotta say no
One girl that I'm looking for, there, there she go
I knew you'd be back for another round
Give me a chance to lay you down

The night is young
We're having fun
Show me love, hit me up
You're so beautiful

When we dance
Heaven opens up
Girl I just thought that I should let you know (let you know)

Baby, when the night is done, I'll let you go
But I promise you'll be back for more
I wanna touch you like I did before
So baby take my hand, take my hand

I'm a make you love me again (make you love me again, love me again)
I'm a make you love me again (make you love me again)
I'm a make you love me again

Tell me what you like on the floor, on the floor
All night what you wanna do
Baby girl, it's up to you, up, up to you
I knew you'd be back for another round
The way that you move just knocks me down, oh girl

The night is young
We're having fun
Show me love, hit me up
You're so beautiful

When we dance
Heaven opens up
Girl I just thought that I should let you know

Baby, baby, when the night is done, I'll let you go
But I promise you'll be back for more
I wanna touch you like I did before
So baby take my hand, take my hand

I'm a make you love me again (make you love me again, love me again)
I'm a make you love me again (make you love me again)
I'm a make you love me again
I'm a make you love me again

Baby, when the night is done, I'll let you go
But I promise you'll be back for more
I wanna touch you like I did before
So baby take my hand, take my hand

I'm a make you love me again (make you love me again, love me again)
I'm a make you love me again (make you love me again, love me again)
I'm a make you love me again

Ey ey
Love me again
Ey Ey
Love me again
Ey Ey
Love me again
(Make you love me again, love me again)
