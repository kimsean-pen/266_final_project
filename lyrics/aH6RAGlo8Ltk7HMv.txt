I never thought that I was so blind
I can finally see the truth
It's me for you
Tonight you can't imagine that I'm by your side
'Cause it's never gonna be the truth
So far for you

But can you hear me say?
Don't throw me away
And there's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow

I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday but all I have is time
Our love's the perfect crime

I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me

Take everything that I know you'll break
And I give my life away
So far for you

But can you hear me say?
Don't throw me away
And there's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow

I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday but all I have is time
Our love's the perfect crime

I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me

Tonight I'm weak (tonight I'm weak)
It's just another day without you
That I can't sleep (I can't sleep)
I gave away the world for you to

Hear me say
Don't throw me away (don't throw me away)
And there's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow
All I wanna do is touch you

I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday but I all I have is time
Our love's the perfect crime

I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me

I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too (everyday)
But I all I have is time
Our love's the perfect crime

I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you (I wanna)
You wanna touch me too (I wanna)
Every way and when they set me free (I wanna)
Just put your hands on me
