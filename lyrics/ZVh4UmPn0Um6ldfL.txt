Well I just lost a lover, who done found somebody else
I get cool and lonely, feelin sorry for myself

Private World

Oh you call that drivin then see us dream
How could it last, I'm tryin hard not to scream

Private World
Private World

The joint start shakin, its ready to crumble
The boys are dukin, lookin for a rumble

Oh, you know I want some money, she replies
When uptown comes downtown, better take her for a ride

Private World
Private World

How many called, called my name
I'm tryin to explain, that I'm not the same

In a Private World
In a Private World

Well I just lost a lover, who done found somebody else
I get cool and lonely, feelin sorry for myself

In a Private World
In a Private World

One that is movin, at least I'm movin

(Better keep it confidential)

You got to keep it confidential
You got to keep it confidential
When I says hush
Child dont you cry
I'm beggin you hush
And dry those tears from your eyes
You gotta hush
Dontcha know you gotta hush

(Oh, alright)
