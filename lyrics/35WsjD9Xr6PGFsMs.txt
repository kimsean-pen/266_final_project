Took a little breather of my own
I might be too far gone
Little fragments of my life
Are slowly dying
Trying not to be so far from home
But will I be there alone?
Fragile pieces of my mind
I'm feeling paralysed
Compromised

So let it out, let it go
Just spit it out straight till I'm not breathing
Get it out, take it all
Just let it all find a way to be
So let it out, let it go
Just spit it out straight till I'm not breathing
Get it out, take it all
Just let it all find a way to be, way to be

Critical decisions took too long
My promises are strong
Watching loyalties divide
So I'm taking back my life
Golden visions from now on
Can't carry you along
No more explanations why
I've erased the dramatised
Neutralised

So let it out, let it go
Just spit it out straight till I'm not breathing
Get it out, take it all
Just let it all find a way to be
So let it out, let it go
Just spit it out straight till I'm not breathing
Get it out, take it all
Just let it all find a way to be, way to be

So let it all out, let it all go
Let it out, let it all out
So let it all out, let it all go
Let it out, let it all out
So let it all out, let it all go
Let it out, let it all out (let it all go now)
So let it all out, let it all go
Let it out, let it all out (let it all go now)
Let it out

So let it out, let it go
Just spit it out straight till I'm not breathing
Get it out, take it all
Just let it all find a way to be
So let it out, let it go
Just spit it out straight till I'm not breathing
Get it out, take it all
Just let it all find a way to be
