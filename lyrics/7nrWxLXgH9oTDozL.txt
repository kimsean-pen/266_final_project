You're an image pale that points and laughs
A white mistress in a fiery bath
Now tie me down and take me home
I'm not afraid to go

Now tie me down and take me home
I'm not afraid to go

Shake the roots off of the trees
Your conscience fades
Eyes have no vision to see
Your soul degrades
Grey follows in front of me
You've lost your way
Every life is but a death to me

Eventually the jokes aren't free
And nothing's ever funny
Nothing's funny

Blunt self belief, too big to fall
Lead shadow stands just inches tall
I hope to God you never die
Your joke is just my type

Shake the roots off of the trees
Your conscience fades
Eyes have no vision to see
Your soul degrades
Grey follows in front of me
You've lost your way
Every life is but a death to me

Eventually the jokes aren't free
And nothing's ever funny
Nothing's funny

But now I see that the joke's on me
And nothing's ever funny
Nothing's funny

Don't be scared
Don't be scared
Don't be scared
Don't be scared
Don't be scared
Don't be scared

Eventually the jokes aren't free
And nothing's ever funny
Nothing's funny

But now I see that the joke's on me
And nothing's ever funny
Nothing's funny

Your joke is just my type
