It must be something that we call love
Wherever I go I'm coming back
And time cannot knock me off my track
This resolution is final

It must be something that we call love
It's when you're craving to say her name
And my reality seems to break apart
With her arrival

No need to worry, rain falling down
It's our happiest story
And there's no one around
We will go for it and I know
You'll be mine forever

Windows wide open, flying so high
Both of us roaming
Through magnificent sky
Rain keeps on falling and I know
You'll be mine forever

It must be something that we call dream
When all you told me I know by heart
The type of beauty I call supreme
And how it's driving me crazy

No need to worry, rain falling down
It's our happiest story and
And there's no one around
We will go for it and I know
You'll be mine forever

Windows wide open, flying so high
Both of us roaming
Through magnificent sky
Rain keeps on falling and I know
You'll be mine forever

You'll always sing me something new
I will always follow
When I first saw you here I knew
That I was blind before you

No need to worry, rain falling down
It's our happiest story
And there's no one around
We will go for it and I know
You'll be mine forever

Windows wide open, flying so high
Both of us roaming
Through magnificent sky
Rain keeps on falling and I know
You'll be mine forever
