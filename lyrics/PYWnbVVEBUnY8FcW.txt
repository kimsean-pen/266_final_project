I want someone to love me
For who I am
I want someone to need me
Is that so bad?

I want to break all the madness
But it's all I have

I want someone to love me
For who I am
Nothing makes sense
Nothing makes sense anymore

Nothing is right
Nothing is right when you're gone
Losing my breath
Losing my right to be born

I'm frightened to death
I'm frightened that I'll won't be strong
I want someone to love me
For who I am

I want someone to need me
Is that so bad?
I want to break our madness
But it's all I have

I want someone to love me
For who I am
Shakin' it off
I'm shaking off all of the pain

Breaking my heart
Breaking my heart once again
I want someone to love me
For who I am

I want someone to need me
Is that so bad?
I want to break our madness
But it's all I have

I want someone to love me
For who I am
Are you going to love me?

Yeah
For who I am?
I want someone to love me
For who I am
I want someone to need me
Is that so bad?
I want to break our madness
But it's all I have
I want someone to love me
For who I am, yeah, who I am
