Mmm

I saw you yesterday,
It's been a while.
You tried, but failed
At holding back your smile right then (then).
It's not over yet.
I knew, for you.
I couldn't sleep,
I thought of nothing else,
I needed help.
Everyone was telling me
You were movin' on with someone else.
But what we had was so special,
People can be jealous.
Oh, I had to see it for myself.

I can see it in your eyes.
You feel the same about us as I.
There is no way the truth can be disguised.
You're still in love with me.
You were never really out of love with me.
Your eyes don't lie.

I know I hurt you,
I know you're hurtin' still.
But I'll make it up to you,
Yeah, baby, I will.
'Cause what we had was so special.
You know we can't give it up.
Now that I'm lookin' at you,
I can see

I can see it in your eyes (your eyes)
You feel the same about us as I
There is no way the truth can be disguised(there's no way)
You're still in love with me.
You were never really out of love with me.
Your eyes don't lie.
And they never will, girl

Ooh, now that I know.
We were apart, but your heart never let go.
So thank you for showing me with one look,
What used to be and still is a possibility.

I can see it in your eyes.
You feel the same about us as I.
There is no way the truth can be disguised.
You're still in love with me.
You were never really out of love with me.
Your eyes don't lie.
Your eyes don't lie.
