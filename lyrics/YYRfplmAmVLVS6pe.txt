Take me by the hand
Will you guide me through this phase
Of not really knowing where I am
Or knowing who I am

I could think of it as
I gave all my best in loving you
But I know it's not true
It's just my way of getting through

We experience the love that we think we deserve
And I guess I thought
I didn't need much from this world
So I left you

But you're exactly what I like
I will give you my whole life
Mmmm you taste so nice
Oh this feels so right

Take me by the throat
Will you push me up against this wall
And spit all your hurt on me
So I can feel my reach
I have these dreams
Of you laying it on me

We experience the love that we think we deserve
And I guess I thought
I didn't need much from this world
So I left you

But you're exactly what I like
I will give you my whole life
Mmmm you taste so nice
Oh this feels so right

We can't explain why
We hurt the ones we love most of all
Deep in the iris
You see a place of hope again
