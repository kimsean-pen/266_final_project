Somehow I've failed in your eyes
Somehow I've gone stale
Is that all that you wanted from me?
I've seen the weight of regret
In the look you give me when we're alone
It wasn't there the day we met
How could we have ever known?
Am I not all that you wanted?
At all?
Sometimes I hear you crying
When I'm pretending to sleep
Is it that hard to love me,
Or is love just hard to keep?
I think it is.
Yeah
