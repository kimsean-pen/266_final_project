There's a quiet place
That gives me peace when I'm alone with You
There's a hiding place
Your Spirit's always there when I'm confused
Only You can purify
All this world won't ever satisfy
My heart, it cries

As the deer pants for the water
So my soul, need You Lord
When thirsty God, You're the living water
And my soul, need You Lord
I need You Lord
I need You Lord
I need You Lord
I need You Lord

I'm a stranger here
Thirsty 'cause I know it's not my home
Like a desert here
I need Your living Word for these dry bones
Jesus fill us up again
With Your presence flowing deep within
Now life begins

As the deer pants for the water
So my soul, need You Lord
Thirsty God, You're the living water
And my soul, need You Lord
As the deer pants for the water
So my soul, I need You Lord
Thirsty God, You're the living water
And my soul, need You Lord
I need You Lord
I need You Lord
I need You Lord
I need You Lord

Quench our hearts and fill this space with Heaven like a flood
Holy One reign down on us with Your consuming love
Quench our hearts and fill this space with Heaven like a flood
Holy One reign down on us with Your consuming love

As the deer pants for the water
So my soul, I need You Lord
Thirsty God, You're the living water
And my soul, Jesus, it needs You Lord
I need You Lord
I need You Lord
I need, I need, I need you Lord
I need You Lord

I need You Lord
I need You Lord
I need You Lord
