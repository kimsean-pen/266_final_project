Can you believe it?
It's been almost ten years now
And I'm getting that feeling
As we're driving 'round this town

Passing by the old school yard
Everything just looks so small
Before the drums and the guitars
Way back when we knew it all

And she's sitting right next to me
Hand in the wind
That old white Cherokee I grew up in
Yeah, it's crazy, crazy but it's true

That you never get a second chance at the first time
We will never be 18 again
No, you never get a second chance at the first time
Feels so good to see you, my old friend
It's good to see you again

Can you believe it?
How much everything has changed
Well, they shut down the old diner
And they put in some new chain

You know, it's so good to see
Whoa, man, your hair has got so long
Feels like it's been forever
We're still signing that old song

Well, she's sitting right next to me
Hand in the wind
That old white Cherokee I grew up in
Yeah, it's crazy, crazy but it's true

That you never get a second chance at the first time
We will never be 18 again
No, you never get a second chance at the first time
Feels so good to see you, my old friend

Well, you know they say that growing up is hard
Well, it's so hard to think of how we almost got so far
Well, do you remember the night of our first kiss?
Well, baby did it feel a little just like this, ooh

Well, she's sitting right next to me
Hand in the wind
That old white Cherokee I grew up in
Yeah, it's crazy, crazy but it's true

Well, you never get a second chance at the first time
We will never be eighteen again
No, you never get a second chance at the first time
Feels so good to see you, my old friend
It's good to see you again

It's good to see you again
It's good to see you again
It's good to see you again
It's good to see you again
It's good to see you again
It's good to see you again
