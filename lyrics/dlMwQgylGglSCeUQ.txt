(How I lost my boy)
(How I lost my boy)
The king in I died
He kept floating past my eyes
Singing his songs
Life was good, now death's all wrong
Cause you can't feel a thing
No heart flutters in the spring
You just drift and pray
For sun kissed golden days
And I can't hold what's in my hand
Don't do any good to say this isn't what I planned
Little kids sliding down the steel park slide
Little kids can't play with things that have died
Sometimes all I want is one favorite song
But two to three minutes doesn't seem that long
Where's my mom? I wanna hold her tight
She's so far away from crowded nights
I'm going cuckoo, cuckoo
cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo
We're all goin cuckoo, cuckoo
cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo
We're all goin'
I said please stay
You can see me, don't go away
I can't see the landscape
Please describe its amaranthine haze
It's hard where I am
There are people, you're not like them
They just look away
For rain quenched golden days
My tears quench five feet of lawn
I just creep I cannot yawn
People gonna come and people gonna cry
He just woke and ate, and dreamed and died
Don't try to erase what you have done
Put your fingers in your mouth and kiss it if it wants
And where's my friend? I wanna hold him tight
He's so far away from mountain lights
I'm going cuckoo, cuckoo
cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo
I'm going cuckoo, cuckoo
cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo
We're all goin'
And, I can't hold what's in my hand
Don't do any good to say this isn't what I planned
Little kids sliding down the steel park slide
Little kids can't play with things that have died
Sometimes all I want is one favorite song
But two to three minutes doesn't seem that long
Where's my mom? I wanna hold her tight
She's so far away from crowded nights
I'm going cuckoo, cuckoo
cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo
We're all goin cuckoo, cuckoo
cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo
We're all goin'
(cuckoo)
