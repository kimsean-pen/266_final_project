I am desire but you are weak
And I despise the sound of leaks
in veins to quiet to even speak
Just bleed despair but never scream
I am revenge and disbelief
And I regret the tracks I leave
in snow that isn't even deep
I hold the blade, sharp as can be
You had me going out of my head
With all the things that you said
You had me going out of my head
But now I walk away from you instead
I am on fire but you retreat
With arteries so tense they shriek
anemic secrets that won't keep
A heart that numb must choose deceit
I am mayhem and treachery
And dead-ends never bothered me
Your hollow voice shouts, "Victory!"
But whispers, restless, when you sleep,
"She had me going out of my head"
I did descend but now I'm free
And I confess you still seem sweet
But you no longer disarm me
You had me going out of my head
With all the things that you said
You had me going out of my head
But now I walk away from you instead
