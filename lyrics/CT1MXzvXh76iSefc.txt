You are a star
You wear it well
You blow my mind tonight
So we can dance all night

Nothing I could tell you
You look good when you wear it well
Nothing I could tell you
You look good when you wear it well

Nothing I could tell you
You look good when you wear it well
Nothing I could tell you
You look good when you wear it well

Tonight tonight you're a star
Won't you stay a while
You wear it well, wear it well, wear it well
Sing me your song
So we can dance all night

Nothing I could tell you
You look good when you wear it well
Nothing I could tell you
You look good when you wear it well

Nothing I could tell you
You look good when you wear it well
Nothing I could tell you
You look good when you wear it well

Nothing I could tell you
You look good when you wear it well
Nothing I could tell you
You look good when you wear it well
