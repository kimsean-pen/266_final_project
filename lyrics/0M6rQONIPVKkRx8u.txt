Giving birth to belief
Heard a voice suffocate behind the trees
Felt us tremble to speak
Then we drove all the words into a dream

A crash remembered
Lying in a pool on the street
So young and tender
A life floating next to me

Full of hate pure of heart
Nothing good ever came so easy
From above you were caught
What a shame that you won't believe me

Fear's a love song
Flooding our brains
On we must go
Like we already knew
Still our hearts are lonely
