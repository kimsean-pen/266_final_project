Everything I do
Surrounds these pieces of my life
That often change
Or hey, maybe I've changed

Sometimes seeming happy
Can be self-destructive
Even when you're sane
Yeah you're only insane

But don't bother waking me today

Here I am
I'm so young
I know I've been bitter
I've been jaded
I'm alone
Everyday, I bite my tongue
If you only knew
My mind was full of razors
To cut you like a
Word if only sung

But this is my song
This is my song

I live everyday
Like they'll never be a last one
Till they're gone
And they're gone
I'm not too proud to beg for
Your attention and your friendship
And your time
So you could come and get it from now on

Here I am
I'm so young
I know I've been bitter
I've been jaded
I'm alone
Everyday, I bite my tongue
If you only knew
My mind was full of razors
To cut you like a
Word if only sung

This is my song
This is my song

And it's you
It is you

Here I am
I'm so young
I know I've been bitter
I've been jaded
I'm alone
Everyday, I bite my tongue
If you only knew
My mind was full of razors
I'm not sure I can take it
I've nothing strong to hold to
I'm way too old to hate you
My mind is full of razors
To cut you like a
Word if only sung

But this is my song
