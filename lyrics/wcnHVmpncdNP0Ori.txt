Living a dream
Having fun
Love is my addiction
I don't care what they say
This life I'm gonna live it
My life can get so crazy
Oh yeah oh oh
Our life is so amazing
It's like forever
Only time will tell
How I feel about you
Own the world, overdose my heart
Cause boy you sailed right through

You make me smile
You make me dream
You make me feel alive
You make me dance
You make me feel it
You make me come to life
You make me come alive
You make me feel alive
You make me come alive
You make me come alive

Come here dream girl
I'll be your princess
Whatever you choose
I'll travel the world just to be with you
Oh oh oh oh
I'll put on a show when it's all for you
You baby oh yeah
Can't stop thinking of this
Love is true
I just wanna be
I just wanna live in the moment

Only time will tell
How I feel about you
Own the world, overdose my heart
Cause boy you sailed right through

You make me smile
You make me dream
You make me feel alive
You make me dance
You make me feel it
You make me come to life
You make me come alive
You make me feel alive
You make me come alive
You make me come alive

Here's my heart
Laying on the light
Know that nothing's perfect
Never giving up
Gotta live my life
No regrets, no worries
This could be our last dance to feel alive

You make me smile
You make me dream
You make me feel alive
You make me dance
You make me feel it
You make me come to life
You make me come alive
You make me feel alive
You make me come alive
You make me come alive
