I sense the darkness
The desire overtakes
My devotion endeavors
Habitation changing course

Repentance, oh no
No shame or remorse
Will I ever authorize
On this treasured path

I am warm by this fire
And its flaming desire
For what I cannot fulfill
My destiny completes

I believe my truth to be
A much greater thing
Than a manufactured lie
Too great to comprehend

Where I come from
There's no higher authority but me
Being my own god
Is all I was meant to be
