Molly

I see you naked in the bath
Cigarette stains on your hands
Wilted flowers in a vase
I ask how are you
Yeah, how are you?

I see your lipstick on your glass
And I think you're drunk,
I start to laugh
And i find the note
The letters ran
And it said i loved you
Yea i loved you

Don't ask why
(Don't ask why)
Don't ask why
(Don't ask why)
Don't ask why
(Don't ask why)
Don't ask why
Don't ask why

Sixteen candles down the drain

I watch you passed out for awhile
I touch your face and start to smile
And on your note is my reply
I wish I loved you
I wish I loved you

Don't ask why
(Don't ask why)
Don't ask why
(Don't ask why)
Don't ask why
(Don't ask why)
Don't ask why
Don't ask why

Sixteen candles down the drain

The drain
Sixteen candles down the drain
The drain
Sixteen candle down the drain
The drain
Sixteen candles down the drain
The drain
The drain
The drain

Don't ask why
(don't ask why)
(Don't ask why)
(Don't ask why)
Don't ask why
(Don't ask why)
(Don't ask why)
(Don't ask why)

Sixteen Candles down the drain

The Drain
