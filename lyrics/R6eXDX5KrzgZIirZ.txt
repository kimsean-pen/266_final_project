tear the world in two
and choose a half
but(?) look inside you
you are what you are
i've seen it through
and you will too
I can tell that you
feel these things too

?
and teach yourself to walk
into the hole
exploding in your heart
i've seen it through
and you will too
I can tell that you
feel these things too

i've seen it through
and you will too
I can tell that you
feel these things too
you tear the world in two
i'll destroy you
