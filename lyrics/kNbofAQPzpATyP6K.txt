Lay your head down on me
I believe we made it out
Bury your head in my heart now
When its too loud
Take another ride and hold it in
Chemicals rise and grace your skin
Bury your head in my heart now
And take me down
We are hardly sober
Young, light, and over feeling low
When your heart is so hard
And you are all alone
All I need now
Is the light from the afterglow
All I see now
Is the smoke from the aftershow
All I need now
Is the light fromthe afterglow
All I see now
Its all I see, you're all I need
Lay your head down on me
I can see theres something else
Open your heavy eyes
I will lead you underground
Take another dive and wath me die
A blooming love a beautiful lie
Bury your head in my heart now
All I need now
Is the light from the afterglow
All I see now
Is the smoke from the aftershow
All I need now
Is the light from the afterglow
All I see now
Its all I see you're all I need
