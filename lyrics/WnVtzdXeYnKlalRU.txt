Don't know what you're doin'
But you're doin' somethin' I think I like
Not sure what I'm feelin'
But it feels like somethin' so right

The sound of your sigh the touch of your skin
Is takin' me places I've never been
I wanna go there again and again
'Cause you give me

Satisfaction, when you're touchin' me
You start a chain reaction deep inside of me
Satisfaction I just never knew
That I could feel this way oh babe, I love you

Holdin' you close now
I keep thinkin' of times before
When nothin' was good enough
I was always left wantin' more

You took my world, turned it around
I know you won't be lettin' me down
'Cause baby, you showed me
That love could be found when you gave me

Satisfaction, when you're touchin' me
You start a chain reaction deep inside of me
Satisfaction I just never knew
That I could feel this way oh babe, I love you

Satisfaction, when you're touchin' me
You start a chain reaction deep inside of me
Satisfaction I just never knew
That I could feel this way oh babe, I love you

Satisfaction, when you're touchin' me
You start a chain reaction deep inside of me
Satisfaction I just never knew
That I could feel this way oh babe, I love you
