By the time that we woke up,
We couldn't stop the sparks,
We couldn't see outside,
When the curtains fell apart.

We couldn't hear the books
When the pages curled away.
We should shut that window we both left open now.

We lost our chance to run,
Now the door's too hot to touch.
We should hold our breaths with mouths together now.
