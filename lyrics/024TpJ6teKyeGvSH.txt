OOO AAA, OOO AAA,
AAA, AAA
OOO AAA, OOO AAA,
AAA, AAA

Taking the backseat, you ardent and pleading so back
AAA, AAA, AAA, AAA
Open my seems tell me
Somebody needs, so do I

Moving you sweat, drip and thumb
We would dance, sing and charm
When we decide
Whether you're somewhat my tongue
And my mouth of my love
Open wide

And I want to go, and I want to stay
And I want to beg, and I don't know why
I get open wide, like a broken grave
But I need to know, after all we gave

But I take you home, and I'll only wait
I will give that up, if for a moment just stay
And I make it rush, like an open grave
I will lay you down, if for a moment just stay
OOO AAA, OOO AAA
OOO AAA, OOO AAA
OOO
For a moment just stay
OOO AAA, OOO AAA
OOO AAA, OOO AAA
OOO

Taste all my senses, you know where I've been
So alive
Tell me your secret, it's all I can keep,
How do I?

And I want to go, and I want to stay
And I want to beg, and I want you know
If I hold your love, like a broken game
But it's not enough, no, it's too late

But I take you home, and I'll only wait
I will give that up, if for a moment just stay
And I make it rush, like an open grave
I will lay you down, if for a moment just stay
If for a moment just stay
Won't you let me drown?

But I take you home, and I'll only wait
I will give that up, if for a moment just stay
And I make it rush, like an open grave

Just stay, just stay
If for a moment just stay
