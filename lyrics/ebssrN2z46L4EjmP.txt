Do you know what this is
No, I don't
But whatever it is
It's very powerful
Have you felt this way before
Oh, I thought I knew
Do you know that I love you now
Oh yes, I do

Love is...
You've got the softest lips

You know that I cannot stay
Yes, I know
It has nothing to do
With you or with love
Oh, yes it does
Do not call or come around here
Do not tell
You know that I loved you then
Oh well...

Love is...
You've got the softest lips
Love is...
The touch of your fingertips
Love is...
Knowing you won't let go

She awakens things
That he said he thought were dead
He says, are you happy now
Oh yes, I am
But when it's over
How then will you feel
Will you miss those arms that used to go
Around you

So she stood there in the hallway frozen
In the dark
And her heart broke down
She cried
She fell to the floor

One tear slid across her lips
To the corner of her mouth
Love is...
And dropped to the floor

Love is...
You've got the softest lips
Love is...
The touch of your fingertips
Ooh, she says love is
Knowing you wont let go
Love is...
Watching you go

You're so very powerful
Love is...

Am I happy
Yes I am
Do I know you love me now
Yes I do
Do I know you cannot stay
I know
All about love
All about love

You're so very powerful
