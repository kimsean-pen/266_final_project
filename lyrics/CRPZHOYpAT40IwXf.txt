Yesterday
Any way you made it was just fine
Saw you turn your days into night-times
Didn't you know
You can't make it without ever even trying
And something's on your mind, isn't it

Let these times
Show you that you're breaking up your mind
Leaving all your dreams too far behind
Didn't you see
You can't make it without ever even trying
And something's on your mind, isn't it

Maybe another day you'll want to feel another
way
You can't stop crying
You haven't got a thing to say
You're feeling you want to run away
There's no use trying anyway
I've seen the writing on the wall
Who cannot maintain will always fall
Didn't you know
You can't make it without ever even trying
And something's on your mind, isn't it
Something's on your mind, isn't it
Something's on your mind
