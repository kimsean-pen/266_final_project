Swinging man
I'm hanging around
Hangin' 'round I'm the swinging man and my feet
Never touch the ground
Swinging man
Swinging man
I swing back and forth
Back and forth
Back and forth
Back and forth
I was looking for a little warmth
But I didn't find nuthin'
So now I'm hanging around
Swinging man
Feeling no pain
No pain
No pain
No pain
All the girls know my name
I go by; swinging man
Swinging man
I tell you what - you get yourself together
And you go downtown, you come on home
And I'll still be hangin' around
Because I'm the swinging man
And my feet never touch the ground
Now if you love me, you'll cut me down
But if not, I'll still be hangin' around cause
I'm the swinging man and my feet
Never touch the ground I'm the swinging man.
