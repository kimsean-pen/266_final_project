Hello Baaaay... beeee!

U.S. Prime, Grade A, stamped guaranteed
Grease it up, and turn on the heat
You got to throw it down, and roll it over once, maybe twice
Then chow down, and down, and down, and down

Cause she's good enough, good enough to... huh!
Me, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
When it's good enough to... huh!

Hey, oh me, I been working up an appetite
It seems like the harder I work the more my body needs
I like to open up, come on give me six on the half shell
Cause it's 3-6-9 time!

Cause she's good enough, good enough to... huh!
I cant get enough, I can't get enough

Wow
She's good enough
She's good enough
Good enough
She's a, she's good enough to ooh!

(Guitar Solo)

Hey waitress, looka here mam!
You got any specials here tonight
Me and the fellas might be interested in?
What's that, what? ... Rack a' what?
Well I'll have some of that!

Hey, hey, hey
I'll be the first to say that I'm blind to the world
(blind to the world)
Cause I'm two days gone, and I just cant see
(just can't see)
But I ain't no fool, and honey I know a good thing
(good thing)
And she's comin, now she's comin
Now come on, come on, come on, come on
Cause she's good, good, good enough
Good, good, good enough
Good, good, good enough
Good, good, she's good enough
Good, good, good!
Good enough to... love!
