They say that no man is an island
And good things come to those who wait
But the things I hear are there
Just to remind me
Every dog will have his day

The spirits they intoxicate me
I watched them infiltrate my soul
They try to say it's too late for me
Tell my guns I'm coming home

I swear I'm gonna live forever
Tell my maker he can wait
I'm riding somewhere south of heaven
Heading back to Santa Fe

It's judgement day in Santa Fe
Once I was promised absolution
There's only one solution for my sins
You gotta face your ghosts and know
With no illusions

That only one of you is going home again
And I blame this world for making
A good man evil
It's this world that can drive a
Good man mad
And it's this world that turns a killer
Into a hero
Well I blame this world for making

A good man bad
Now I ain't getting into heaven
If the devil has his way
I swear I'm gonna live forever
Heading back to Santa Fe
Got debts to pay in Santa Fe

It's judgement day in Santa Fe

Solo
So I save a prayer
For when I need it most
To the Father, Son
And the Holy Ghost
And sign it from a sinner

With no name
When I meet my maker
When I close the book
On the hearts I broke
And the lives I took
Will he walk away
'Cause my soul's
Too late to save
Now I ain't getting into heaven
If the devil has his way
I swear I'm gonna live forever
Heading back to Santa Fe
Got debts to pay in Santa Fe
It's judgement day in Santa Fe
