I know you'll stay, but I don't know how long
Is it ok or do you think its wrong?
Half opened eyes, wake me with your voice
Full hearted sighs now don't make a noise

I'll wait a long time to really understand
Promise its worth it though it not what you planned
Don't let me keep you from doing what you want
A soul you can see through, hold on until you're gone
Hold on until you're gone
Hold on until you're gone
Hold on until you're gone
Hold on until you're gone
Hold on until you're gone
Hold on until you're gone
Hold on until you're gone
