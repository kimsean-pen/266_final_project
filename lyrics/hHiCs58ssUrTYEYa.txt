Hotel Angelterre
A case for Nathan Adler
Loss or romance?

False God
I see you
I know your name
I love you
I am you

The aperture
Reveals less than what it hides
Lest you echo

False God
I see you
I know your name
I love you
I am you

All over again

The lyric fetishized
Immortal word
Admire, but isolate
Beware! Idols!

The rest are only ones and zeros
Shootings stars
Kill your heroes where they sleep

The idol threat
The lazy creep of double speak
Kill yours heroes where they sleep
