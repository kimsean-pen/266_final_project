After the great flood, all washed away, I still stayed
And through the crashing waves you'd promised me that you would wait cause,
I was the white light in your sad, desperate loneliness yet,
You left me swimming in circles as you rescued yourself.

Waking up so paralyzed
Sunlight poured through the blinds
Wishing I could shut my eyes
Wishing I could just shut my eyes

When you look back you'll turn into- this I promise you-
A pillar of salt that I'll walk through and I'll scatter you
Into the wind back to the day we met where you'll settle into
A standing pile of stones I'll skip across that ocean we knew

One by one till there's nothing left of you
One by one by one by one
Bye Bye Bye
