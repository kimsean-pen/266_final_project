Empty and sweating
head lying in your hands
shaking in the corner
done too much alcohol
gotta get away from it all
'cause it feels my blood is freezing
my self insanity has taken its toll
frustration has taken its control
Now i'm far from home
spending time alone
it's time to set my demons free
been put to the test
my mind laid to rest
i'm on a psycho holiday
Shot down on sight
you are the target of attention
one woman here another there
you can't please all the people all the time
can't tell the strangers
from the friends you know
frustration has taken it's control
Now you're far from home
spending time alone
it's time to set your demons free
been put through the test
your mind laid to rest
you're on a psycho holiday
I'm strapped in for life
is this where i lived
or where i died
you want my money
you take my space
my mind is telling me
to leave this place
my self insanity has taken its toll
frustration has taken its control
Now you're far from home
spending time alone
it's time to set your demons free
been put through the test
your mind laid to rest
you're on a psycho holiday
Now you're far from home
spending time alone
it's time to set your demons free
been put through the test
your mind laid to rest
you're on a psycho holiday
