You're pulling me in, and peeping me out
I can admit, i had my doubts
A shock to the heart, i'd never expect
You gave me life back frome the dead

Ah uh ah uh ah uh, i'm the perfect man
Ah uh ah uh ah uh, then i'm nothing
Ah uh ah uh ah uh, help me understand
Ah uh ah uh ah uh, what's the purpose?

If you where me, what would you say?
Perfect pretense to cast your shade
I can recall a time from before
You were the one who needed more

You're not alone, you're here with me
I can feel your breathing
The dawning sun will heal your pain
Until you come back home to me
