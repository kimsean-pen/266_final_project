Hey, Josie, you never say sorry
Did I do something to upset you?
You know that I tried to keep it simple
So persistent I'm making things so difficult

You keep trying to play me
Making me feel crazy now, now
But every time I see you, you say you wanna date me
Why you always changing now, now?
You're talking through your teeth to me

You say things you won't mean tomorrow
And I'm chasing a path you wouldn't follow
You will have to try to keep it simple
Every word that you say is just so typical

You keep trying to play me
Making me feel crazy now, now
But every time I see you, you say you wanna date me
Why you always changing now, now?
You're talking through your teeth to me

It's the same old thing
Like every single day
You tell me that you're trying
But I know that you're lying
'Cause every time I see you
You're talking through your teeth to me

Hey, Josie, you never say sorry

You keep trying to play me
Making me feel crazy now, now
But every time I see you, you say you wanna date me
Why you always changing now, now?
You're talking through your teeth to me

It's the same old thing
Like every single day
You tell me that you're trying
But I know that you're lying
'Cause every time I see you
You're talking through your teeth to me
