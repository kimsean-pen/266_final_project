well you shouldn't doctor yourself
well i pictured somebody else
someone who looks like
what i look like
would you say that the one of your dreams
got in you and ripped out the seams
that's what i'd say
that's what i'd say
he was a sucker for your double dose
motherf***er turned white as a ghose
don't you say hi
don't you say hi
with your broken sink for a face
in a head that just takes up space
he's not half right
he's not half right
it's already half past
and it won't last
i was sticking up for my friend
well there's nothing much to defend
it's a lost fight
it's a lost fight
cos when i talk to you on the phone
well, it's just like being alone
it's not half right
it's not half right
