In the depths of the underground
Through the nurseries of real metal sound
Governing the molten core
No more slavery anymore

THE WINDS! THEY CALLED - THE DUNGEON SHAKER
THE WINDS! THEY CALLED - THE DUNGEON SHAKER

We are older and wiser (and) the underground thrives
(but) posers are the same with their metal lies
In a seance of insanity with maniacal screams
Does your metal knows what metal really means?

THE WINDS! THEY CALLED - THE DUNGEON SHAKER
THE WINDS! THEY CALLED - THE DUNGEON SHAKER
To the Bone!
