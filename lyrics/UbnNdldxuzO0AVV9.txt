Strange brew, kill what's inside of you

She's a witch of trouble in electric blue
In her own mad mind, she's in love with you
With you, now what you gonna do?
Strange brew, kill what's inside of you

She's some kind of demon messin' in the glue
If you don't watch out, it'll stick to you
To you, what kind of fool are you?
Strange brew, kill what's inside of you

On a boat in the middle of a raging sea
She would make a scene for it all to be
Ignored, and wouldn't you be bored?
Strange brew, kill what's inside of you

Strange brew, strange brew
Strange brew, strange brew
Strange brew, kill what's inside of you
