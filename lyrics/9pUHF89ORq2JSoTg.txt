Heartbreak
Heart heart heartbreak

Girl don't say you love me when you're out the door
Whoa yeah,
'Cause I know things are different than they were before

Whoa yeah,
You kill me with your kiss
It's so hard to resist you
When you look me in the eyes tonight
And say we're heading for a heart heart heartbreak
And I don't ever ever wanna hear you say

Don't say you love me
Don't even
Don't say you love me
You're leavin'
We're heading for a heart heart heartbreak
I'm gonna go and turn around and walk away

Don't say you love me
Don't even
Don't say you love me
You're leavin'
You say we stick it out through the thick and thin (whoa yeah)

When the walls came down you wouldn't let me in (whoa yeah)
We've been through it all

My backs against the wall
It's crashin' down on me tonight

And we're headin' for a heart heart heartbreak
And I don't ever ever wanna hear you say
Don't say you love me
Don't even
Don't say you love me
You're leavin'

We're headin' for a heart heart heartbreak
And I'm gonna go and turn around and walk away
Don't say you love me
Don't even

Don't say you love me
You're leavin'
I'm sick and tired of this whole situation
Here comes another fight
Beating me down with the same conversation
No don't say you love me tonight
And we're headin' for a heart heart heartbreak

And I don't ever ever wanna hear you say
Don't say you love me
Don't even
Don't say you love me
You're leavin'
And we're headin' for a heart heart heartbreak

And I'm gonna go and turn around and walk away
Don't say you love me
Don't even
Don't say you love me
You're leavin'
Said we're headin' for a heart heart heartbreak
And I don't ever ever wanna hear you say
Don't say you love me
Don't even
Don't say you love me
You're leavin'
