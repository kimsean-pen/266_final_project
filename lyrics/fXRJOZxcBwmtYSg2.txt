When I breathe and I breathe into you
And I feel you right to the bone
And I give what you give
And we go even higher than we are strong
And the cracks in the walls
Covered up by the sheets we live underneath
All the sex, all the nights we stay up
Yeah we're stuck, but we're more than free

Ooooh, Aaaah
Oooooh, Aaaaah

Got the world in our hand like our land
Good enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
And we live like legends now know that will never die

We got love, we got love
Good enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
And we live like legends now know that will never die

We got love, we got love
I can feel that you feel what I feel
And I feel it all in your hands
When we touch it's too much
And you're making me move
Yeah, now you make me dance
Going body to body for good
Saying nobody gets it right

We don't plan, we don't care
Got the fume and the flame

We don't let it die
Ooooh, Aaaah
Oooooh, Aaaaah
Got the world in our hand like our land

Good enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
And we live like legends now know that will never die
We got love, we got love

Good enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
And we live like legends now know that will never die
We got love, we got love
(Lo-o-ove)
Perfect like a picture
I know we are one and the same
(Lo-o-ove)
Perfect like a picture
Even when they look through the grains
(Mm-mm-mm-mm)
Good enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
And we live like legends now know that will never die
We got love, we got love
Good enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
And we live like legends now know that will never die
We got love, we got love
(Lo-o-ove)
We got love, we got love
(Lo-o-ove)
We got love, we got love
(Lo-o-ove)
