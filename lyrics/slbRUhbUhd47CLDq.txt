Sweeping the void - like sin
Treachery penetrates my skin
Serpent shapes in the depths
Obsolete acts of kindness

The Wolf I feed, in cloaks of decency
The Wolves I feed
Invoke the blessing of peace

Supply lines of the swarm ensuring
Danger and harm
As the first wave diminishes,
Depleted stronghold vanishing

The Wolf I feed in cloaks of decency
The Wolves I feed,
Provoke war-waged capacities

The Wolf I feed, to ward off wildfires
Blind alleys lead,
Violating cease-fire

Domain of the parish
That march in Eden
Corridors of sadness
Embrace the Masses

Truths transcends time beyond
The stones of destiny
Celestial land mines
Of sacred geometry

The Wolf I feed to ward off wildfires
Blind alley freed,
Violating cease-fires

A wake up call,
Traverse the wilderness
Death by design with
Cosmic significance

Immobilized in its path
Bearing the bulk of the burden
Authoritarian trails between
The colony and queen

The Wolf I feed
Outweighed, policed and rationed
The Wolves I feed
Our liberties seized and blackened
