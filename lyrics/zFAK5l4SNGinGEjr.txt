Don't fall asleep
To the weeping of the birds
Don't fall asleep
In this room of the fallen

Don't fall asleep
To the breathing of the walls
Don't fall asleep
In this room of loss
Don't fall asleep
In the arms of dead air
Don't fall asleep
In this symphony of the damned

"Time stands still in this chamber of pain
The clock stops and the horror comes
The children cry and weep
In this room of the unforgiven
Lie down because you'll never leave
Lie down, but don't fall asleep"

The signs show slowly with the dark
They glow brighter as the shadows grow deeper

Blood marks on the walls and the ceiling and on the floor and the doors, oh how they flow!

Little voices like the whining of the birds

As the closet door opens

I still can hear them screaming
And the shape... Is it me on the piano?

Playing the symphony of the damned
