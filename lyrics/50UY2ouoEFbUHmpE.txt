Though it hurts to go away it's impossible to stay
But there's one thing I must say before I go
I love you (I love you) you know
I'll be thinking of you in most everything I do
Now the time is moving on and I really should be gone
But you keep me hanging on for one more smile

I love you (I love you) all the while
With your cute little way will you promise that you'll save your kisses for me?
Save all your kisses for me
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Don't cry honey, don't cry

Gonna walk out that door, but I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Don't you dare me to stay, 'cause you know I'll have to say

That I've got to work each day and that's why I go away
But I count the seconds till I'm home with you
I love you (I love you), it's true
You're so cute honey gee
Won't you save them up for me?
Your kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Gonna walk out that door, but I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Don't you dare me to stay, 'cause you know you've got to save

Your kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Won't you save them for me even though you're only three?
