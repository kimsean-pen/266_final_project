I love my god, god made love
I love my god, god made love
I love my god, god made hate
I love my god, god made hate
I love my god, god made good
I love my god, god made good
I love my god, god made man
I love my god, god made me

But I don't wanna pray to my maker
I just wanna be what I see
Not just who I am but the pink and darling land
And that fiery wild sky over me
Help me through the sun
Hey, I'm looking everywhere
See I'm looking to become not the pray-er but the prayer

And now I don't wanna pray
I say I don't wanna pray
Hey now I don't wanna pray
I don't wanna pray

I love my god, god made love
I love my god, god made love
I love my god, god made good
I love my god, god made hate
I love my god, god made man
I love my god, god made, god made war

But I don't wanna pray to my maker
I just wanna be feeling free
Not like in a book or the leaves of trees that shook
For the word that means only not a thing
Darling, darling mom what I'm saying isn't fair
See I'm looking to become not the pray-er but the prayer

And now I don't wanna pray
You say I don't wanna pray
Hey now I don't wanna pray
You don't wanna pray

Not much good to talk, better to walk it
Not much good to take, better to give
We have both forgiven and forgotten all our sins
Yeah I promise you my friend all the gods will live again
Yeah darling, darling, mom what I'm saying isn't fair
See I'm looking to become not the pray-er but the prayer

And now I don't wanna pray
You say I don't wanna pray
Oh now I don't wanna pray
You don't wanna pray

I love my god, god made love
I love my god, god made love
I love my god, god made hate
I love my god, god made hate
I love my god, god made good
I love my god, god made good
I love my god, god made man
I love my god, god made me
