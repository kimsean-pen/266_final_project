My skin is like a map
Of where my heart has been
And I can't hide the marks
But it's not a negative thing
So I let down my guard
Drop my defenses
Down by my clothes
I'm learning to fall
With no safety net
To cushion the blow

I bruise easily
So be gentle
When you handle me
There's a mark you leave
Like a love heart
Carved on a tree
I bruise easily
Can't scratch the surface
Without moving me
Underneath
I bruise easily

I bruise easily

I found your fingerprints
On a glass of wine
Do you know you're leaving them
All over this heart of mine too
But if I never take
This leap of faith
I'll never know
So I'm learning to fall

With no safety net
To cushion the blow

I bruise easily
So be gentle
When you handle me
There's a mark you leave
Like a love heart
Carved on a tree
I bruise easily
Can't scratch the surface
Without moving me

Underneath
I bruise easily
I bruise easily

Anyone who can touch you
Can hurt you or heal you
Anyone who can reach you
Can love you or leave you

So be gentle

So be gentle
So be gentle
So be gentle
So be gentle
Oh oh oh oh oh

I bruise easily
So be gentle
When you handle me
There's a mark you leave
Like a love heart
Carved on a tree

I bruise easily
Can't scratch the surface
Without moving me
Underneath
I bruise easily
I bruise easily

I bruise easily
(Anyone who)
So be gentle
(Can touch you)
When you handle me
(Can hurt you)
There's a mark
(Or heal you)
You leave
(Anyone who)
Like a love heart
(Can reach you)
Carved on a tree
(Can love you)

(Or leave you)
I bruise easily
Can't scratch the surface
Without moving me
Underneath
I bruise easily
I bruise easily
Yeah yeah yeah
I bruise easily
Oh yeah oh
I bruise easily
