I was a little too tall, could've used a few pounds
Tight pants points, hardly renowned
She was a black-haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points of her own, sittin' way up high
Way up firm and high

Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues

Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves
In the summertime
Ummm, in the sweet summertime

We weren't in love, oh no, far from it
We weren't searchin' for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Livin' by the sword

And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, to the alley or the trusty woods
I used her, she used me
But neither one cared
We were gettin' our share

Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
Mmm, and it was summertime
Mmm, sweet, summertime, summertime

Ohh, wonderin', felt the lightning, yeah
And I waited on the thunder, waited on the thunder

I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered?
Started hummin' a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves, with autumn closin' in

Mmm, night moves, mmm (Night moves)
Night moves (Night moves), yeah
(Night moves) I remember
(Night moves) Ah, I sure remember the night moves
(Night moves) Ain't it funny how you remember?
(Night moves) Funny how you remember
(Night moves) I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember
(Night moves) Ohh, ohh, ohh
(Night moves) We were workin'
Workin' and practicin' (Night moves)
Workin' and practicin' (Night moves), oh, on the night moves
Night moves (Night moves)
Oh (Night moves), I remember
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember (Night moves)
Oooh (Night moves), I remember
Lord I remember, Lord I remember (Night moves)
Ha, ha, ooh-hoo
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh huh, uh huh
I remember, I remember
