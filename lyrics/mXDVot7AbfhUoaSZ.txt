Someone take these dreams away
That point me to another day
A duel of personalities
A stranger to reality

They keep calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me

When figures from the past stand tall
And mocking voices ring the hall
Imperialistic house of prayer
Conquistadors who took their share

They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me

Calling me
Calling me
Calling me
Calling me

They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
