I turned up with my cap on back to front
Trying to be someone I saw on TV once
You were sitting by the window looking out for me
We were trying to find a way to say 'Hi'
That didn't seem strange but it didn't work out
Maybe that was just the way that it felt to me

It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could be more than friends
But maybe I'm just too shy, too shy

It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could be more than friends
Maybe I'm just too shy, too shy

Walking home down the Uxbridge Road
Headphones on I got a cigarette rolled
I know

I shouldn't light it cause I haven't smoked one for weeks
Conversations running through my head
'Til I get stuck on one thing you should not have said but you said
And now it's all that I can think about

It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could be more than friends
But maybe I'm just too shy, too shy

It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could be more than friends
Maybe I'm just too shy, too shy

Let's go find a corner we can sit in
And talk about that film instead of us
Even though throughout it I was thinking
I was gonna say I love you afterwards

It's taken me so long
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could be more than friends
But maybe I'm just too shy, too shy
It's taken me so long (It's taken me so long)
Maybe I'm just too shy to say it
We could be more than friends (Maybe I'm too shy)
Maybe I'm just too shy (Maybe I'm, maybe I'm), too shy
It's taken me so long (it's taken me so long)
Maybe I'm just too shy, too shy
We could be more than friends (too shy)
Maybe I'm just too shy (Maybe I'm, maybe I'm), too shy
