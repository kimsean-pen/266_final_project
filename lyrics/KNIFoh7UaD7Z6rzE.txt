Eh-eh-oh, eh-eh-oh.
Eh-eh-oh, eh-eh-oh.

Some gas is on. I'm driving.
I am in control under fifty miles an hour.
I don't mind the speed, no, but I've got my demons.
I am in control: call that human power.

I will walk there,
Eh-oh, eh-eh-eh-oh.
Is there anybody out there?
Eh-oh, eh-eh-eh-oh.

And I only want to drive,
Want to go far, far away.
I only know that I,
I'm alone, I'm leaving today.
Eh-eh-oh, eh-eh-oh.
And I only want to drive and move on.

Got no brakes, I'm flying,
Never losing control, moving at the speed of light.
Exactly what I need, oh, and I don't need no sleep, no,
'Cause I am in control and I will never stop.

I will walk there,
Eh-oh, eh-eh-eh-oh.
Is there anybody out there?
Eh-oh, eh-eh-eh-oh.

And I only want to drive,
Want to go far, far away.
I only know that I,
I'm alone, I'm leaving today.
Eh-eh-oh, eh-eh-oh.
And I only want to drive and move on.
Eh-eh-oh, eh-eh-oh.

Never looking back, never looking back,
Never looking back, never looking back.

Want to go far, far away.
I only know that I,
I'm alone, I'm leaving today.
Eh-eh-oh, eh-eh-oh.
(Never looking back, never looking back.)
And I only want to drive and move on.
(Never looking back, never looking back.)
Eh-eh-oh.
