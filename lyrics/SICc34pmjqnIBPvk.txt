I wonder how you're feeling
There's ringing in my ears
And no one to relate to except the sea

Who can I believe in?
I'm kneeling on the floor
There has to be a force, who do I phone?

The stars are out and shinning
But all I really want to know
Oh, won't you show me the way everyday?
I want you, show me the way

Well, I can see no reason
You're living on your nerves
When someone drops a cup and I submerge

I'm swimming in a circle
I feel I'm going down
There has to be a fool to play my part

Well someone thought of healing
But all I really want to know
Oh, won't you show me the way everyday?
I want you, show me the way
Ohh, I want you day after day

I wonder if I'm dreaming
I feel so unashamed
I can't believe this is happening to me

I watch you when you're sleeping
And then I want to take your love
Oh, won't you show me the way everyday?
I want you, show me the way one more time
I want you day after day, hey
I want you day after day, hey

I want you, show me the way everyday
I want you, show me the way night and day
I want you day after day hey, ohh
