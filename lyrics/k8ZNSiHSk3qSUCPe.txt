I? m going round, I? m going down
To my friend's house to get myself high
It takes me to a different place
Where nothing leaves my mind

But the men in blue knocked on my door
He said I? ve come to kill off your kind
It? s the killing of the mind

The circus came then packed up their things
When there? s no one around
We? ll be high as kings, without the things
Like jewels and gold

I? m rolling down, I? m rolling down to my hotel
Between the lines
The paperboy still looks the same
As the old get old and the young are feeling fine

A soldier came, knocked on my wall
He said I? ve come to kill off your kind
It? s the killing of the mind

The circus came then packed up their things
When there? s no one around
We? ll be high as kings, without the things
Like jewels and gold

The circus came then packed up their things
When there? s no one around
We? ll be high as kings, without the things
Like jewels and gold
