It ticks fast - Tick tack doom
Lithium fills this whole room
It's flooded there in front of us
It's close to us
Let it fight -- Win win loss
A prostitute for the thrust
A starlet yearns for death and lust
She is one of us
I will never
Never forgive
Never ever forgive
Arclight
And the living will see
Arclight
How their death will be
Look at the past -- It's tip top black
A burnt life behind your own back
It will never let you go there alone
It's your flesh and bone
Here it comes -- Take it -- Bang!
Stuck with your neck in it's fangs
It's a copy of human dust
It's sure one with us
I will never
Never forgive
Never ever forgive
Arclight
And the living will see
Arclight
How their death will be
All the lives I have lived
Will die now
And the stars lost their grace
It's sulphur mixed with rain
Dig down your heart...
Dig down your heart in this soil
Dig it down next to me
Feed the flames so the serpents uncoil
And let the arclight free
