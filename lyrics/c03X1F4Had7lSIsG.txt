(Jim McGuinn & David Crosby)

I see you la la la la la la la la la la la la I see you
I see you la la la la la la la la la la la la I see you
I see you la la la la la la la la la la la la I see you
Sun smiling sun through the cave of your hair
wind washing tulips out of space sitting there
I love you
At your door second floor first world war
I love you
Who listens
Tell your friend I*m aware that she care
who listens
Green specks bright spiraling out in the sky
catch my eye turn my head have to look don*t know why
I see you
Everywhere behind your hair over there
I see you
I see you though your eyes can tell lies I sympathize,
I see you
Sun smiling sun through the cave of your hair
wind washing tulips out of space sitting there
I love you
(Guitar solo)
I see you
Everywhere behind your hair over there
I see you
I love you at your door second floor first world war
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
