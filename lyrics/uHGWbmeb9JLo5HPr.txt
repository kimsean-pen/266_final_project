Go back ten years ago sunbeams dancing round
Go back ten yeas ago sunbeams dancing down
Autumn's child Autumn's child

Autumn's child got a loophole round her finger
Halo rings her head
Cornhusk hair makes me linger
A cat's stare meet s my dare
A man's chair greets my stare
Gonna be my wife she sang she said
Gonna be my wife gonna spice my life she said
Go back ten years ago sunbeams everywhere
Go back ten years ago sunbeams fill the air

Harvest moon be nimble
Apples bob and tremble
Fish pond streaks love kind
Found the child I have to find
Apples shine share together
Got the time to make her mine
Fish pond streaks love kind
Found the child I had to find

Autumn's child, I met her at a balloon bust picnic
She caught me with the beauty queen
With jade-green eyes buttons and bows and fancy ties
The feet of dust under trees of rust
Make them sandals gambol under knees of trust
Gonna be my wife gonna spice my life she sang she said
Gonna be my wife gonna spice my life she said

Go back ten years ago sunbeams shining down
Go back ten years ago sunbeams glancin' round...
Autumn's child...
