Cycle of wasted years
Selfish ways and constant fear
Cut through the fog of a grand design
That serves itself

Dig a ditch for the dead
Dump 'em in
Cover them
But the pain doesn't decompose
And the promises that you made
Start to
Burn brighter than they ever have
Pure torment
Void of emotion
More than I can take

I bleed myself dry
Trying to bury the hurt inside

Destroying Aphrodite
With the grip of Zeus
Prisoner of desire
Love on fire

Take back what you wasted
That precious seed
Self-induced pleasure coma
Is the killer you seek

Over and over
With all the same results
Bleed myself dry
From self-induced assault
Every fucking time
The screen lures me in
And I'm back again
In the blink of an eye

Bright screen
Bodies meet
Dissolve my heart
Paralyze my thoughts
Bled dry
Every time
Bodies meet
In a blink of an eye

Destroying Aphrodite
With the grip of Zeus
Prisoner of desire
Love on fire

Take back what you wasted
That precious seed
Self-induced pleasure coma
Is the killer you seek

Dig a ditch for the dead
Dump 'em in
Cover them

Cycle of wasted years
Selfish ways and constant fear
Cut through the fog of a grand design
That serves itself

No the pain doesn't decompose
And the promises burn bright
The pain doesn't decompose
The promises just burn brighter
And brighter
Now they burn
Always and forever after
