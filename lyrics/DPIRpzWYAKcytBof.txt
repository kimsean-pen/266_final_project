Oh that girl can kill you with a smile
She'll see you coming from a mile
So don't leave nothing in your pockets.

Oh where she'll make your [something] change
And she'll put poison in your brain
[something]

I want you to know
I'm telling you she's cold to her soul
Everything ain't glitter and gold,
even though it's blinding.

She's a kleptomaniac, she'll steal your heart.
Such a maniac, under her control.
Kleptomaniac.
Give your all, she wants more and more and more

Maniac x6

[something] in disguise
So don't leave nothing in your pockets
[something]

Oh where she'll make your [something] change

And she'll put poison in your brain
[something]

I want you to know
I'm telling you she's cold to her soul.
Everything ain't glitter and gold,
Even though it's blinding.

She's a kleptomaniac, she'll steal your heart
Such a maniac, under her control
Kleptomaniac.
Give your all, she wants more and more and more
