Don't let me darken your door
That's not what I came here for
No it's not what I came here for

And I won't hear you cry when I'm gone
I won't know if I'm doing you wrong
I never know if I'm doing you wrong

A constant reminder of where I can find her
Or a light that might give up the way
Is all that I'm asking for without her I'm lost
Oh my love dont' fade away
So watch the world tear us apart

A stoic mind and bleeding heart
You never see my bleeding heart
And your lights always shining on

And I've been traveling oh so long
I've been traveling oh so long
A constant reminder of where I can find her
Or a light that might give up the way
Is all that I'm asking for without her I'm lost
Oh my love don't fade away
Oh my love don't fade away
