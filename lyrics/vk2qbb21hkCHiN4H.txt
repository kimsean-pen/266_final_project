I don't know you but I know what you did to her
She told me and I happen to believe her too

They will be three steps behind
You will not know what's got you
Oh so you're sorry now
All is not well, it's not ended

Hold your breath til it's over
There's something left underwater

You've been quiet, there are things that you do not speak of
But if you stay gone a little longer your keys won't work

Cause I will be two steps behind
You will not know what's got you
Oh so you're sorry now
All is not well, it's not ended

Hold your breath til its over
There's something left underwater
Hold your breath til its over
There's something left underwater
Hold your breath til its over
There's something left underwater
Hold your breath til its over
There's something left underwater
