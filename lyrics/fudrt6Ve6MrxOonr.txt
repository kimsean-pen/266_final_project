If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me.

You got designer shades,
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me.
And you never say hey,
Or remember my name.
Its probably 'cause,
You think you're cooler than me.

You got your high brow,
Shoes on your feet,
And you wear them around,
Like it ain't shit.
But you don't know,
The way that you look,
When your steps
Make
That
Much
Noise.

Shh, I got you,
All figured out,
You meet everyone's eyes just to feel seen.
Behind your make-up
Nobody knows
Who you really are
Who you think that you are

If I could write you a song,
And make you fall in love,
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used up all my tricks,
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't,
You think you're cooler than me.

You got designer shades,
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like,
You're cooler than me.
And you never say hey,
Or remember my name.
It's probably 'cause,
You think you're cooler than me.

You got your hot crowd,
Switch in your walk,
And you don't even look when you pass by.
But you don't know,
The way that you look.
When your steps make
That
Much
Noise.

Shh, I got you,
All figured out,
You meet everyone's eyes just to feel seen.
Behind your make-up
Nobody knows
Who you really are
Who you think that you are

'Cause it sure seems
You got no doubt
But we all see
You got your head in the clouds

If I could write you a song,
And make you fall in love,
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used up all my tricks,
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't,
You think you're cooler than me.

You got designer shades,
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like,
You're cooler than me.
And you never say hey,
Or remember my name.
Its probably 'cause,
You think you're cooler than me.
