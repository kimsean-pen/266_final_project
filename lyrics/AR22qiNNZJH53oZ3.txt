We wander the fields of death... In eternity wandering our own path
Which has been the quest of immortality
Yet to conquer for me - but dreams shall not be torn
He is spirit
He is stone
And he is immortality
The king of the shadowthrone
And he will then conquerer (of death)
Fall as a stone from the mountain
And die, led to destruction
Once he left in you then in the past
Then the sea should be worthless
Spirit rise from you rest and return for them
I am spirit
I am stone
And I am immortal
