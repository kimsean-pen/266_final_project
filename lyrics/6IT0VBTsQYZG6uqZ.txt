You're afraid to love me
You're afraid to even know me
We walk on the street at night
You tell your friends that I'm a fright
I'm green when you kick me
Your man thinks he's bigger than my law
You're ashamed of me
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do!
You're afraid to bite me
You're afraid to even touch me
We walk in the zoo at night
You tell your bears that I'm a fright
I'm green when you kick me
Your man thinks he's bigger than my law
You're ashamed of me
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do!
Your guns
Are made of
Deadly feathers
My death
Asfixiates your
Golden matters
Henry Miller
Goes in deeper
Deep like a scab
Reach like a knife!
Your eyes are steep
My love is cold
I'm green when you kick me
Your man thinks he's bigger than my law
You're ashamed of me
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do!
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do!
