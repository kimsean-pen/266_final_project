Starting up a riot
one mans escalation
turns to something bigger
he was looking for adventure

a man on a mission
to create his illusions
his life lacking substance
crying for adventure
Looking kind of anxious
Trying for attention
looking for affection
lacking his own conscience
Trying for attention
looking for affection
lacking his own conscience

A Life that leaves an echo
something to remember
to follow your own footsteps
you wind up walking in circles

So take my hand we'll follow
our thirst of wanderlust
i'll guide you through so be strong
so I can hold on fast/you can hold on fast

If you only take his hand
and follow his wanderlust
she'll guide you through

Looking for affection
trying for attention
prying out an answer
looking for adventure
Finding it in others
lacking his own conscience
