Give me an open game
Don't let it get too far away
This world is not to blame
You've got to protect your name
When everything, everything, everything goes down
All the dust will settle in this new world now
We can make it our own together
We can make it our own together
Give me a second chance
Don't let it fade so fast
This life isn't made to last
You've got to run while you can
When everything, everything, everything goes down
All the dust will settle in this new world now
We can make it our own together
We can make it our own together
Everything, everything
