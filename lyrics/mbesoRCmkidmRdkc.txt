Being crushed from your closing walls.
I never thought it would have come to this.
I'd try to tell you but my lungs are being crushed.
My voice is the last thing that I thought I'd ever miss.
I hope this makes you see just how you destroy me.
Now I guess I'm just a liar.
Would I be lying if I said I don't know?
Now I guess that this is over
and I'm sorry that you have nothing to show.
I hope this makes you see just how you destroy me
and I can't do what you please
when I haven't been standing on my own two feet.
I'll come running back to you just like you knew I'd do.
