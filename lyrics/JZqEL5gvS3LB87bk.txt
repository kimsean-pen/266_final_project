All the girls on go, get your money on your own
Let me see you get low on the floor

I got on my dress
I plan on going in tonight
I'mma give you my best
I was waiting on you
'Cause when I dro-dro-drop it down
Everybody gon' see
Are you li-li-liking now?
All eyes on me
'Cause the way this thing rollin'
And the smoke that you're smoking feels good, uh-huh

At the end of the night
Girls just wanna have fun
Hair swinging in the air
Show 'em, show 'em what you working with
At the end of the night
Girls just wanna have fun

'Cause we don't really care, we don't really care
Girls just wanna have fun

Now see I got your attention
I'mma play upon it
In the club, and I'm choosing
You gon' be that one tonight
'Cause when I dro-dro-drop it down
Everybody gon' see
Are you li-li-liking now?
All eyes on me
'Cause the way this thing rollin'
And the smoke that you're smoking feels good, uh-huh

At the end of the night
Girls just wanna have fun
Hair swinging in the air
Show 'em, show 'em what you working with
At the end of the night
Girls just wanna have fun

'Cause we don't really care, we don't really care
Girls just wanna have fun

Girls just wanna have fun

All the girls on go, get your money on your own
Let me see you get low on the floor
'Cause you got a one-night pass
Need more, my glass
Pull me baby this your song
And if you do it up real big
Ain't worry about, turnt up, we'll be all night long
Give it to 'em
Give it to 'em

At the end of the night
Girls just wanna have fun
Hair swinging in the air
Show 'em, show 'em what you working with
At the end of the night
Girls just wanna have fun

'Cause we don't really care, we don't really care
Girls just wanna have fun

Girls just wanna have fun
