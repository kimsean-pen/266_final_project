What do you want me to say?
I ain't got nothing left for you

Hands lie still
'cause you still look good
When you lie to me
And anything in between

when you walk so mad

lay it down hard and *you hit my up and?*
she's addicted to the prettier things
all but over you
over you
over, baby, whatcha gotta lose?

come and stay ay ay ay with me
leave it on the low
but lady don't lie ie ie ie to me
no, you really don't, really don't
hurt so bad, hurt so bad
when you move, your lips move your body like
come on, over you, over you
over, baby, whatcha gotta lose?

come and stay ay ay ay

you're burning in my eyes
*and buring in my hands
and burning to my hands
and burning to my head
and burn into my eyes?*

we're hung up on these lights
you're hung up on these like
