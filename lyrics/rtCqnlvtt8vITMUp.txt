Take it slow
Keep it on the low
Focus on yourself babygirl
'Cause now it's time to grow
Don't miss the boat
We are 'bout to blow right now
Take care no float right now, right now

My soul, my soul
But it won't look better on you no, noo
Now you know more
Now you know more

Take the flight
'Cause see yourself some different vibes
Make sure you're alright
Get your money straight
'Cause these boys don't love right now
Nurture your faith right now
(You gotta)

My soul, my soul
But it won't look better on you no, noo
Now you know more
Now you know more
Had a tough time
But don't let it mark you
You don't need no one
To comfort yourself, embrace yourself
All of this by myself
All of this without no help
