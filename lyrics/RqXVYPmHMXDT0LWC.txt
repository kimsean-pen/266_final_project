You say you really know me
You're not afraid to show me
What is in your eyes
So tell me 'bout the rumours
Are they only rumours?
Are they only lies?

Falling out of a perfect dream
Coming out of the blue
Is it true? (Is it true?)
Is it over?
Did I throw it away?
Was it you? (Was it you?)

Did you tell me
You would never leave me this way?
If you really knew me
You couldn't do this to me
You would be my friend
If one of us is lying
There's no use in trying

No need to pretend
Falling out of a perfect dream
Coming out of the blue
Is it true? (Is it true?)
Is it over?

Did I throw it away?
Was it you? (Was it you?)
Did you tell me
You would never leave me this way?
Is it true? (Is it true?)

Is it over?
Did I throw it away?
Was it you? (Was it you?)
Did you tell me
You would never leave me this way?
(Is it real?)
(Did I dream it?)
Will I wake from this pain?
Is it true? (Is it true?)
Is it over?
Baby, did I throw it away?
Ooh... is it true?
