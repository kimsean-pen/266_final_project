Now here we go dropping science dropping it all over
Like bumping around the town like when you're driving a Range Rover
Expanding the horizons and expanding the parameters
Expanding the rhymes of sucker M.C. amateurs
And Naugels, Isaac Newton and Scientific E.Z.
Ah Ben Franklin with the kite ah gettin' over with the key
Now rock shocking the mic as many times times the times tables
Rock well to tell dispel all of the old fables
'Cause I've been dropping the new science
And I've been kicking the new knowledge
An M.C. to a degree that you can't get in college
Now the dregs of the earth and the eggs that I eat
I've got pegs through my hands and one through my feet
Shea Stadium the radium E M D squared
Kicked out of the Palladium you think that I cared
It's the sound of science
The sounds of science
Science.

Rope a dope
The newest in new
"Right up to your face and dis you"
Waxin' and milkin'
All of ya'll square heads

Time and money for girls covered with honey
You lie and aspire to be as cunning
Reeling and rockin' and rollin' B size D cup
Order the quarter deluxe why don't you wake up
My mind is kinda flowin' like an oil projector
Had to get up to get the Jimmy protector
Went berserk and worked and exploded
She woke up in the morning and her face was coated
Buddy you study the man on the mic
D. do what you like huh D.
Well Drunk a skunk am I from the celebration
To peep that freak unique penetration
Well I figured out who makes the crack
It's the suckers with the badges and the blue jackets
A professor of science cause I keep droppin' it
I smell weak cause you keep poppin' it
And people always asking what's the phenomenon
"Yo what's up" yo what's goin' on
No one really knows what I'm talking about
Yeah that's right my name's Yauch

Ponce De Leon constantly on
The fountain of youth not Robotron
Peace is a word I've heard before
So move and move and move upon the dance floor
'Cause I'm gonna' die gonna' die one day
Cause I'm goin' and goin' and goin' this way
Not like a roach or a piece of toast
I'm goin' out first class ain't goin' out coach
Rock my Adidas never rock Fila
"I do not sniff the coke I only smoke the sinsemilla"
Well with my nose I knows and with my scopes I scope
What I live I write and that is strictly rope
I've got science for any occasion
Postulating theorems formulating equations
Well Cheech wizard in a snow blizzard
Eating chicken gizzards with a girl named Lizzy
Droppin' science like Galileo dropped the orange
