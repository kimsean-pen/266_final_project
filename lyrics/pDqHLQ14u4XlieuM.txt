Crowded streets are cleared away one by one
Hollow heroes separate as they run
You're so cold, keep your hand in mine
Wise men wonder while strong men die

Show me how it ends, it's all right
Show me how defenseless you really are

Satisfied and empty inside
Well that's alright, let's give this another try
If you find your family don't you cry
In this land of make believe, dead and dry
You're so cold but you feel alive

Lay your hand on me one last time
Show me how it ends, it's all right
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside

Well that's alright, let's give this another try
*Instrumental*

Show me how it ends, it's all right
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well that's alright, let's give this another try
It's alright

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right...
