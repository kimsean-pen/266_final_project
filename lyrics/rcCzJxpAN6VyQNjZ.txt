I rub the sleep out of my eye
In bed at morning light
Can't be arsed today, but of course there's mega bills to pay
"I've got to get up" he declared
She turns her head and looks at him
She don't know why he's here
It was last night [?] last night a dream more terrible
"I've got to get out" she said, to herself
And he's like "Don't go [?]"
Maybe somehow break tea with me will chemically cause her heart to skip a beat
Maybe our hearts will outshine the moon
Unconvinced she turns to leave
Hovis slice between her teeth
Keys, once lost, now found with glee
Jumps, skip, hop now out the door
Now he ain't the one
He just ain't the one man, you just know innit

It's just you're forgettable
It's just you're forgettable
I think that's the issue, babe
I want to feel magic and stars
Is that too much to ask? x2

She's out of bed, she's checking in
I don't know why she cares
All just swings and roundabouts and I just want to shout
"Sick of this game" she sighed to herself
He's like on and looking up, can't believe his luck
Thought there was a spark of some sort, I guess we made it up
"I'd better give up" he said, in defeat
But he's like "No way, maybe some day
Walking streets she may pass my way
And obviously see the real me, change of heart
Next thing she's falling into my arms
So convinced but foolishly
Some things just ain't meant to be
Life goes on, or so I'm told
I guess that girl weren't for me
She just ain't the one man, you just know innit

It's just you're forgettable
It's just you're forgettable
I think that's the issue, babe
I want to feel magic and stars
Is that too much to ask? x2
