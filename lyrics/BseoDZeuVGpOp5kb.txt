Every morning when I woke up
I was choked up
I was living without a purpose
Always jumping over hurdles
Doing circles in the dark with a broken compass

I can't explain the way it feels
I could trip on my own words
I make mistakes, that much is clear
But I made it here, my love
Yeah, I made it here, my love

You are the one thing that I got right
It's a fickle world, yeah, it's a fickle world
You turned the darkness into sunlight
I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
And if I mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
'Cause you are the one thing that I got right
Right, right, right

Ey, ey, ey
One thing I got right
Ey, ey, ey
One thing I got right

Every morning when you wake up
I want to hold you
I just need to be wrapped around you
It's kinda funny when you think that you just got here
Now I know I can't live without you

I can't explain the way it feels
I could choke on my own words
Sometimes it seems like it ain't real
But you're really here, my love
Yeah, you're really here, my love

You are the one thing that I got right
It's a fickle world, yeah, it's a fickle world
You turned the darkness into sunlight
I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
And if I mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
'Cause you are the one thing that I got right
Right, right, right

Every time I see your smile
Every time I hear your laugh
Baby, you bring a new sunshine over my way
You are that little dream I had since I was a child
My fairy tale comes true when I look at your face

I may not be here forever
But it'll be a long road together
I already know
We're gonna be fine, fine, fine
We're gonna be just fine, fine, fine

You are the one thing that I got right
It's a fickle world, yeah, it's a fickle world
You turned the darkness into sunlight
I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
And if I mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
'Cause you are the one thing that I got right

You're the one thing that I got right
And if I mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
'Cause you are the one thing that I got right
You are the one thing that I got right

Ey, ey, ey
One thing I got right
Ey, ey, ey
One thing I got right
