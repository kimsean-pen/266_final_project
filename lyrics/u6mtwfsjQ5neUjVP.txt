We all start with the beautiful
Hope, pride, and love
It's never meant to feel so difficult
Your dreams become your drug
I'll give you something to believe in
I'd rather fail than never try

Broken pieces will fall apart
Promises will tear down the trust
Find a reason to give your heart
But I'll find a reason for us

Whoa (I'll found a reason)
Whoa (I'll found a.)

We all wish for a miracle
The shines bright in the dark
Never fall for the ritual
Of pride, killing the art

Broken pieces will fall apart
Promises will tear down the trust
Find a reason to give your heart
But I'll find a reason for us

I remember when we dreamt of lives and
Now we only pray one of the known
I remember when we lived for everything
Looking back now, but it's all gone

Broken pieces will fall apart
Promises will tear down the trust
Find a reason to give your heart
But I'll find a reason for us

Whoa (I'll found a reason)
Whoa (I'll found a.)

Whoa (I'll found a reason)
Whoa
