I'd lose my way, yeah, I'd lose my mind
If I faced one day on my own
I knew I was saved, the night that she gave
This drifter's heart a home

Every night I should be on my knees
Lord knows how lucky I am
I'll never say it near enough
Thank God for this woman, amen

This world has a way of shakin' your faith
I've been broken again and again
But I need all the cracks in my shattered heart
'Cause that's where her love gets in

Every night I should be on my knees
Lord knows how lucky I am
I'll never say it near enough
Thank God for this woman, amen

She gives me faith, she gives me grace
She gives me hope, she gives me strength
She gives me love, love without end
Thank God for this woman, amen

Thanks for the moon and the stars up above
Forgiveness of sin and your undying love
Every twist, every turn for the way you made sure
All my roads led to her

So, tonight I will fall down on my knees
'Cause Lord knows how lucky I am
I'm gonna shout at the top of my lungs
"Thank God for this woman, amen!"
Yeah, thank God for this woman, amen

She gives me faith, she gives me grace
She gives me hope, she gives me strength
She gives me love, love without end
Thank God for this woman, amen
