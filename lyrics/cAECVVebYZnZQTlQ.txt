Hearing sounds
In open doors
Brings a heart-shaped smile
Many lives
Just tiny dots
On earth's great surface shine

It's all here just a moment
One breath and then it's gone
It's all here just a moment
A trick of space and time

Telegraphs
Along the road
Feeding one to one
Sending thoughts
In binary
Til all the power's gone

It's all here just a moment
One breath and then it's gone
It's all here just a moment
A trick of space and time
