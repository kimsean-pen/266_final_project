Land of the free, home of the strange
From shining sea to mountains grey

Didn't get your number
Couldn't catch your name
But you got me under
Girl, you got me tamed

Do what you want to
Do what you please
You are Queen of the ocean
Her majesty

Land of the free, home of the strange
From shining sea to mountains grey
From emperor waves of fame, I will not change
Come put me in my grave, in my grave

I crave your wonder
I shout your name
Feal fists of thunder
Electric rage

Do what you want to
Take what you need
Let me live in the moment
Let freedom be

Land of the free, home of the strange
From shining sea to mountains grey, hey hey
From emperor waves of fame, I will not change
Come put me in my grave, in my grave

In my grave
Come put me in my grave, in my grave
You can put me in my grave, in my grave
Come put me in my grave, in my grave
