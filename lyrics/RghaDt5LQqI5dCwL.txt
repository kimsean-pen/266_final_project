things change yet so much stays the same
life's just a dream we have of reality
love's strength enhances what we have
and then it strips us of our sanity

still i stay
growing strong
every day
closer to you

it's strange
but somehow obvious
that what we want the most
we must let go
your head is freer still than mine
and not so cluttered with morality

still i stay
growing strong
every day
closer to you

closer to you

memories cloud our minds
invading too much time
we build our very own cages
blame's of no significance
in love it's of no relevance to life
this very moment
i'm trying every day
to live each moment new
and free my heart in stages

so i stay
growing strong
every day
closer to you

closer to you

still i stay
growing strong
every day
closer to you
closer to you
closer to you
