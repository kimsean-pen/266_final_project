I'm looking for the words that I've lost on you
Been digging in the dirt
And rewind every day, reminiscence

I can't breathe on my own
(I can't breathe on my own)
Life support, such a bore

I've cried for you, for me, a stranger
I've cried in every room
When will it end, relentless adolescence?

Disappointment and grief come easy
Forgiveness is a mystery
Forgiveness is a mystery, a mystery
Forgiveness is a mystery
(Remind every day)
A mystery (Adolescence)
