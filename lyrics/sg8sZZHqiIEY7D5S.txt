The Faces I've Been
The Edges Of Your Day
Where there is a dream there is a hope for you
Where there is a love there is a way
Coming from the edges of the night to you
Coming from the edges of your day
Waiting in all your towers, keeping all my flowers

If you need me come close now and receive me

While there is a moment there is a time for you
Even though your time is far away
Deep within the night I send my love to you
Reaching for the edges of your day
Spending all my hours, dreaming of your towers
If you need me come close now and receive me
