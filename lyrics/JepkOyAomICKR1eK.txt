There's always something else
No, I'm never really happy when I get it out, too hard on myself
The suffering left you behind
Well, you never made it up but you could blame it on me all night

Have you ever had those dreams where you can fly?
'Cause it hurts you too much, you know we're all gonna die

I won't sleep until Sydney knows my name
I just wanna see my name light up the streets
Or it was all for nothing, all, all for nothing

Life is like a double-sided coin
We play it off as if we ever really had the choice
The difference is what I did with mine
I got something I can hold in my hand, you got nine to five

Have you ever had those dreams where you can fly?
'Cause it hurts you too much, you know we're all gonna die

I won't sleep until Sydney knows my name
I just wanna see my name light up the streets
Or it was all for nothing, all, all for nothing

I won't sleep until Sydney knows my name
I just wanna see my name light up the streets
Or it was all for nothing, all, all for nothing

I won't sleep until Sydney knows my name
I just wanna see my name light up the streets
Or it was all for nothing, all, all for nothing
