You try to run me, but it's not happening
Is this on purpose? Are you an accident?
You try to tell me, tell me, you try to push me round
You're just like gravity, you keep me on the ground

You can't tell me what to do
Last time I checked, I don't belong to you
If you try, just know you will always lose
We just met, I'm already over you

You don't know me, I'm not who you think I am
You don't own me, your wish is not my command
Oh oh oh oh
You think you're in control
You think you're in control
Control, control, control
You think you're in control

You want my cherry kisses, I'm like a purple rain
Caus' I'm your fantasy, the one that you can't contain
Watch how you talk to me, when you speak my name
Who do you think you are, not falling for your game

You can't tell me what to do
Last time I checked, I don't belong to you
If you try, just know you will always lose
We just met, I'm already over you

You don't know me, I'm not who you think I am
You don't own me, your wish is not my command
Oh oh oh oh
You think you're in control
You think you're in control
Control, control, control
You think you're in control

I have no clue who crowned you
King of this world, you don't rule me

Think you're in control
Control, control, control
Think you're in control
Control, control, control, control

You don't know me, I'm not who you think I am
You don't own me, your wish is not my command
Oh oh oh oh
You think you're in control
You think you're in control
