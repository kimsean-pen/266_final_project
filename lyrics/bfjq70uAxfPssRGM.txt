Holding heaven in my hand
It lives and dies by my command
I've stayed too long
Yeah

Put to rest
It's all the same
The dying pull of fascination
Sacrifice
A promised peace
I'm digging a hole while the promise evades

The call has lasted a lifetime
The changing tide calls my name

I have no price to pay
I fear no reprisal

Push away
Piece by piece
The conflicted reservations
Bed of nails
Take a piece of me
I can finally see

I'll turn this world to stone
The wanderer bows to no one

I have no price to pay
I fear no reprisal
A single life to live
I fear no reprisal

Obey
True sanctity
Obey
It's calling me
Obey
The changing of the seas

Obey
True sanctity
Obey
It's calling me
Obey
The changing of the seas

Put to rest
It's all the same
The dying pull of fascination
Sacrifice
A promised peace
I'm digging a hole while the promise evades

I'll turn this world to stone
The wanderer bows to no one

I have no price to pay
I fear no reprisal
A single life to live
I fear no reprisal
