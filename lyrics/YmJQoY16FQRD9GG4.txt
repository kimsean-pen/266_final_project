Everything keeps changing
for the worst,
its not the first.
The only thing that stays the same
is i'm lonely, so lonely.
And im sorry that i cant change.
It's not the same, its not the same.
Lets stop time, before it ends.
Its not the end.
Break these laws and run through halls.
I'll be laughing, you'll be laughing.
These are the times, you read them first.
For all our lives, all our lives.
I'm just a kid, who keeps dreaming.
I'm not ready, I'm not ready
for what the world has talked about
for me to see, for me to see.
