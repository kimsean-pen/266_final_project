Broken
Yeah you been livin' on the edge of a broken dream

So take some good advice, you better stop and think twice
Before you take your first step out that door

If you wanna step up (step up)
You're gonna get knocked down (knocked down)
If you wanna step up (step up)

You're gonna get knocked down
