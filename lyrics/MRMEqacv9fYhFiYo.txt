Soft sound so soothing whisk her away.
Far from the border, towards brighter days.
The City is something that sits so deep in the back
of her head while she's asleep: "Find home, again".

I caught her running down by the stream.
With all types of creatures she'd never see
in The City she left.
With something that sits so deep in the back of her head while she's
asleep: "Find home,
somewhere so far away" knowing you could not spend another day.
In a City that slowly intoxicates with every
breath that we would take. Found home, again.
