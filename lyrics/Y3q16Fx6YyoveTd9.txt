We're feeling alright, yeah
We're feeling good, we're feeling alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh it's about that time for us, to look around, and meet somebody new
Well let's all welcome in, familiar faces, perhaps somebody who
Has a conflict in their life
Oh alright

Tell them you're sorry, but there's ways to change, the wrong to right
See we can sit in a distant haze and watch rain clouds
Pour thoughts of greatness, to help our troubles sail real far away
Oh yeah

Well it's a struggle, every day we're stressin'
But what's a life without dedication?
I'm, I'm gonna pick up that soul's intention
To soak in music, relaxation

We're feeling good, we're feeling alright, yes
We're feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah
We're feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah
We're feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah, yeah, yeah

In a moment I'll be on my way, to better days, while life is changing
And even though I've had my share of pain
I've been sympathizing and realizing
I've got a feeling we could be a better friend simply complementing every now and then

'Cause in the morning I wake up and miss the night before
'Cause I love the music more and more
Yeah we can sit in a distant haze and watch rain clouds
Pour thoughts of greatness, to help our troubles sail real far away
Oh yeah

Well it's a struggle, every day we're stressing
What's a life without dedication?
I'm, I'm trying to pick up that soul's intention
To soak in music relaxation

We're feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah
We're feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah
We're feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah
We're feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah, yeah, yeah

Alright, woah yeah
We're feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah
Well alright, won't you move with us, yes
We're feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah
Well alright, woah yeah

We're feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah
We're feeling good, we're feeling alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
