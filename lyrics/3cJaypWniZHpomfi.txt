眼を輝かせて
手を差し延べようが
I hate, hate, hate you
It's shape, shape of your soul
飾り立てた美辞麗句
聞き飽きたBGM
Erase, delate yourself
I know what you want

憧れてた
場所はどこへ？
Should I pay back to you?
I just pray your greatful dead

潰れそうな心
ひたすら守るため
覆い隠す大事な両目さえ
温度の無い言葉
笑う声さえ冷たく
いっそ消えてしまいたくなる
So what？
I hate, hate, hate you
It's shape, shape of your soul
You lose, lose in your game
Because I noticed that
What you really wanted

I got you
Can't escape everywhere
Can't erase all your past

夢を見た幼き日
疑う術さえ持たずに
開いた心は全てを信じ
I hate, hate, hate you
It's shape, shape of your soul
You lose, lose in your game
It doesn't matter to me

わずかな夢
枯れぬように
Should I pay back to you?
I just pray your greatful dead

いつか消えるならば
全て信じていたい
せめて最後の時までは

嘘まで真実に聞こえそうな世の中で
自分の声失わぬように
矛盾だらけの世界
感情とざす言葉
このまま光失うなら
明日なんて要らない
I hate, hate, hate you
It's shape, shape of your soul
You lose, lose in your game
It doesn't matter to me
