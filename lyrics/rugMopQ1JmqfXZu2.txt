Wherever you go
You will be with me
And when you'll talk
You'll be talking to me

But your secret world
As we walk on by
With the sky full of birds
And the dusk go approaching

Climb the long grassy track
to the top of Winter Hill
Climb the real rocky track
I'll see you back on Winter Hill

Wherever you go
You will return safe
And when you will walk
You'll be walking with me

But if comes the day
You meet someone new
You will be wth them
But I'll be thinking of you

Climb the long grassy track
to the top of Winter Hill
Stay with me see so far
at the top I'll see you back
I'll see you back on Winter Hill

Where she traveled far
Yeah we stayed apart
But she crashed alone
On Winter Hill

Climb the long grassy track to the top
I can't turn back
Climb the real rocky track
to the top of Winter Hill
I'll see you back on Winter Hill
