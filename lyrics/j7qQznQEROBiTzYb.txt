Unlike the water in the deepest ocean
Or Picasso in 1902
Unlike the color of a sky so open
Me, I'm no longer blue

Once was a slave to
The sapphire kingdom
That was overthrown when I met you
Now, unlike the iris in the Garden of Eden
Me, I'm no longer blue

Me, I'm no longer blue

Some people dance
By dangerous seaside
Some people just can't hold through, oh
But the old guitarist now holds his head high
Oh, 'cause I have you

Oh, I'm no longer blue

The tranquil hue of a turquoise gemstone
The talisman of shamans and kings
Ain't worth the treasure
You bring me on your own
Nothing else means a thing

Some people dance by dangerous seaside
Some people just can't hold through, oh
But the old guitarist now holds his head high
Oh, 'cause I have you

Oh, I'm no longer blue

Yeah

Unlike the water in the deepest ocean
Or Picasso in 1902, yeah
Unlike the color of a sky so open
Me, I'm no longer blue
