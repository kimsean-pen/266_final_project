Can't you see
Tell me why
You still linger in a world of strife
Your heart bleeds
You're dead inside
Love to you is like cyanide

Here we go, once again
Nothing's changed, all remains the same
Sharpened words cut like knives
In this state where only frenzy thrives

Can't find a way
We're all lost anyway
Every day's the same
We are all broken

Can't you see
Tell me why
You still linger in a world of strife
Your heart bleeds
You're dead inside
Love to you is like cyanide

All remains unchanged
Lunacy lingers
Tell me who's deranged
Who pulls the trigger
Distant and estranged
Emotionless
Our minds in chains
Revived hopelessness

The candle's burning
Down way too fast
Trauma transcends
Dead ends

Come undone, fallen one
Your spirit and your hope's long gone
Battles lost, none are won
You're hailing from a broken home

Can't find your way
We're all lost anyway
Different day, same pain
We are all broken

Can't you see
Tell me why
You still linger in a world of strife
Your heart bleeds
You're dead inside
Love to you is like cyanide

Can't you see
Tell me why
You still linger in a world of strife
Your heart bleeds
You're dead inside
Love to you is like cyanide
