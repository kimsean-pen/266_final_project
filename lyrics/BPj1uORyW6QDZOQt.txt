Better hold your
Breath
Don't say a prayer for me
Leave me to rest
Sip half an OE then fill it with OJ and drink up the rest
I am alone
I want a place to call home
Aye
You're not alone
I weep a lot more than I like to show

Sick of giving a fuck about the number of times somebody click a bunch of words in blue on top of a line
I never wanted to be a slave to vanity but now look at me ima piece of daddy I never wanted to be and I'm
Tryna find my way to the top of a mountain
But I cannot escape here alive
You cut me and left me to die

Black
Mage
Tat on my Face
Black balaclava it cover my face
Burn
Sage
John
Dee
Reincarnated I'm Aleister Crowely on his worst of days
Stay away
I don't worship Satan I'm just saying that we get along

When I was a lil jit I used to think that I was never gna ever be shit
Now I'm grown
And I still don't know which way I'm goin
Life's a bitch

When I am gone
Summon my soul
Tie me to the floor
Don't let me go
Do what you want
I'm one with my ghost

Fuck
I don't got a thing that I wouldn't leave to be six feet deep
Find me a top of a mountain and let me just conjure up something to help me
(Breathe)
