I've been working with adhesives
Chains and locks and ropes with knots to tether
But nothing's taking to the pieces
I can't seem to hold it all together

But you should know
'Cause that explains why it all just fell apart

It's not the end of the world
Just you and me
We're a part of it, everyone
We're a part of it, everything
And if a nightmare ever does unfold
Perspective is a lovely hand to hold

I've been trying to ingest this
But everything to me just seems like nonsense
And I'm not sure if I can get it
I guess it's time for me to grow a conscience

To combat the lapse
That explains why all of this simply collapsed

It's not the end of the world
Just you and me
We're a part of it, everyone
We're a part of it, everything
And if a nightmare ever does unfold
Perspective is a lovely hand to hold

It's been forever since I've gone
But I'm the Cusack on the lawn of your heart

It may be forever 'til I go
But before then you should know
That I could tear that place apart
If you tear that place apart

I swear this to you

I wish that this was not the truth
But is something that you fell into
Crawling out is hard when you
Are not so sure it's what you want to do

I'm not convinced it's what you want to do

It's just the weight of the world
Giving out under the string
And we're a part of it, everyone
We're a part of it, everything
And when a nightmare finally does unfold
When a nightmare finally shows

It's not the end of the world
Just a calamity
And we're a part of it, everyone
We're a part of it, everything
And when a nightmare finally does unfold
Perspective is a lovely hand to hold
