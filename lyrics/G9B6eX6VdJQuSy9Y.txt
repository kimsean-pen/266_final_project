Bathe myself in the afternoon
Won't get out until the water's cold and I am blue
I see it, I'm killing doubts
So I just open up the door and I ring it out

Don't you get too far from yourself
You're so hard on yourself
Oh, you'll get through
Only hard when you say it's too hard

Colour in, colour in
Feeling empty outside of your outline
You scratch at the door of the divine
Within, colour in
You can't stand the greatness of sunshine
You hide in the bones of a stock image

Shave my head in your bathroom
Sweep my hair under your bed
Look in the mirror till I forget
Everything I know, everything I did
Was just a way to make the time feel faster

Oh, you'll get through
Only hard when you say it's too hard

Colour in, colour in
Feeling empty outside of your outline
You scratch at the door of the divine
Within, colour in
You can't stand the greatness of sunshine
You hide in the bones of a stock image
Of a stock image
You hide in the bones of a stock image

Bathe myself in the afternoon

So I just open up the door

Colour in, colour in
Feeling empty outside of your outline
You scratch at the door of the divine
Within, colour in
You can't stand the greatness of sunshine
You hide in the bones of a stock image
Of a stock image
You hide in the bones of a stock image
