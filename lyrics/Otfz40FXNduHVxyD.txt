In case you never look back
I want you to know that you will love like mad
I hope you live long enough
To change your mind

Where do you think you're going?
I wanna go with you, can I come too?
Nobody knows you better
Nobody loves you quite like I do

In case you ever look twice
Over your shoulder, no, I'm on your side
If you ever open your eyes
Even one more time, oh

Where do you think you're going?
I wanna go with you, can I come too?
Nobody knows you better (nobody knows you better)
Nobody loves you quite like I do

(I'm with) I wish you the best (I'm with, I'm with)
Oh, I hope you have it all (I'm with)
But if you should fall from grace
I'll be waiting at the bottom for you

Where do you think you're going? Woh
I wanna go with you, can I come too? (Ooh)
Nobody knows you better (nobody knows you better), oh, no
Nobody loves you, not like I do
I do love you
