Bombs away... Bombs away...
All is in its place
It's time to lay...
It's time to lay... everything to waste

I'll walk away
Won't hesitate

By the way...
Honesty is everything I've ever wanted
Strip it away... today's the day
In what I do there's no disgrace
Calling you out
Calling!

Calling...
Long may we Reign...
This is Relentless
This is our World
This is Relentless
