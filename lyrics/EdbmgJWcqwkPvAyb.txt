In this world all of our sins are simple
We choose death over innocent life
And in this world it's not our money that's evil
It's the ones who choose it over life
And in my heart I can not believe in this murder
And I will not be fed by the lies,
Or the life that is created just to be murdered
It's murder

No matter how hard they try
And no matter how loud they cry
They can't buy their way into heaven
No matter how hard they try
And no matter how high they climb up the ladder
They won't reach up into heaven

And they can't see the innocent lives
The pointless suffering
And in my heart I wanna undo all this murder
And give back the innocent life
Open cages and stop their luxurious murder
It's murder

No matter how hard they try
And no matter how loud they cry
They can't buy their way into heaven
No matter how hard they try
And no matter how high they climb up the ladder
They won't reach up into heaven

Murder
Innocent life
Innocent
What have we done?

No mercy (no matter how hard they try) for beautiful
(And no matter how loud they cry) Money for blood
(They can't buy their way into heaven) Is murder
No matter how hard they try
And no matter how high they climb up the ladder
They won't reach up into heaven
No matter how hard they try
And no matter how loud they cry
They can't buy their way into heaven
No matter how hard they try
And no matter how high they climb up the ladder
They won't reach up into heaven, heaven, heaven
