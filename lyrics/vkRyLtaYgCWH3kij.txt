Leave, go on and leave, you said
Turn and walk away
Life's not worth it anymore
You stopped shaking and you slowly faded away
Now you're lying on the floor

I can't hear your heart beating anymore, no
I can't hear your heart beating anymore, no

It's all over now
What am I gonna do with all this time I set aside for you
(Aside for you)
I won't be needed now
To pick up the phone and call you
Like I'm supposed to know
You were all alone

Gone, memories gone
I know I was the one
Who was ignoring you for way too long
I hope while sleeping
I know that if you're finding solid ground
You'll know everything is, everything is sound

I can't hear your heart beating anymore, now
(Everything is sound)
I can't hear your heart beating anymore, now

It's all over now
What am I gonna do with all this time I set aside for you
(Aside for you)
Now I won't be needed now
To pick up the phone and call you
Like I'm supposed to know
You were all alone

(Over now, over now)
Maybe someday I can meet you there

It's all over now
What am I gonna do
What am I gonna do

It's all over now
What am I gonna do with all this time I set aside for you
(Aside for you)
I won't be needed now
To pick up the phone and call you
Like I'm supposed to know

No I won't be needed now
To pick up the phone and call you
Like I'm supposed to know
You were all alone
