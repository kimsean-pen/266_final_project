Yeah, no, I had to slow it down 'cause,
Like, my babymother's stressing me out, innit
She just always giving me mad headache,
Like bare passa and that
I just thought, no, like, can't be dealing with that right now
So I just thought, let me come studio
Just listen to some music and that
Like, obviously I play it for you,
But it's for me too, you get me
It's like therapy, innit
It's soothing
