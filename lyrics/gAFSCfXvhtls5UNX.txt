I can't keep pacing
I need your blood tonight
You're so far from me
And I'm so weak inside
Come fly to me, I'll show you what it's like
When the full moon shines
We'll stop hearts together

When we're conjoined at the lips
I feel alive, I feel undead
Pumping new life through these veins
Holding onto the finest thread

Take my hand, grip it tightly (Don't let go)
I promise pain will pass you silently, silently
Take my hand, grip it tightly (Don't let go)
With your neck, I'll kiss you violently, violently

To kiss my lips will leave you cold tonight
You'll need my blood
And I'll devote my life
Come fly to me, I'll show you what it's like
When the full moon shines
We'll stop hearts together

It's just like me to attach affection to a second chance
So pull me any closer and I can tell you how it ends

Take my hand, grip it tightly (Don't let go)
I promise pain will pass you silently, silently
Take my hand, grip it tightly (Don't let go)
With your neck, I'll kiss you violently, violently

Pull away from this embrace before it's too late
Pull away from this embrace before...

Take my hand, grip it tightly
I promise pain will pass you silently
Take my hand, grip it tightly
With your neck, I'll kiss you violently, violently

Pull away from this embrace before, before it's too late
