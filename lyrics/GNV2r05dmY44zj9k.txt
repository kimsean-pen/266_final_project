We Share the Moon, We Share the Stars
When the rain falls, it falls in all
In the Right Place at the Right Time
You Can See the Rainbow Being Defined

Is it Yours, Is it Mine, Is it Ours to Devide
It's Not Yours, It's Not Mine, It Belongs to Us... Sunset Sunrise

Fathers and Daughters, Mothers and Sons
Children of all Children There is Only One Love
We Live Together But We Die Alone
And We Toil the Earth Into the Earth We Returns

Is it Yours, Is it Mine, Is it Ours to Devide
It's Not Yours, It's Not Mine, It Belongs to Us... Sunset Sunrise

Sunrise...
Open Your Eyes...
Open Your Eyes...

We Plant a Tree, We Build a House
And We Write a Book, Take a Long-Long Look
Nothing Lasts Forewer, We Must Come Together
The Only Constant is Changed and the Earth Remains

Is it Yours, Is it Mine, Is it Ours to Devide
It's Not Yours, It's Not Mine, It Belongs to Us... Sunset Sunrise (2x)

You Cant Buy the Moon, You Cant Buy the Starts, You Cant Buy the Earth by a ... (?) Coins
But You Can Buy the Tree With The Grass That's Green
It's Not yours to Deteriorate, Is it Ours to Appretiate
It's Not Yours (Sunset), It's Not Mine (Sunrise), It's Not Ours (Sunset) to Devide

Sunset...
Sunrise...
