You are the subject of many conversations
From three points of light to the fourth
I sang a song that lasted a year
You are the subject of sketches
I made for a sculpture in sound
When you pass the black foliage
Imagine an eternity wrapped in silver sound
When you pass the black extension
Imagine you are the subject eating, walking, making love
Dressing for the universe
There are several layers of meaning,
Hundreds of different aspects of the soul
We cannot simply seek to be known, high points, low points,
All around the globe
You are the subject of sketches
I made for a sculpture in sound
When you pass the black foliage
Imagine an eternity wrapped in silver sound
when you pass the black extension
