You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in

You bring light into a dark place
Walking in light, glowing walking in light
Gold ring around you, the hues of you
The golden sunlight of you

Cool wind following, following after you
Rising for you, your skin beautiful
Everything comes natural, fantastic fan
Rocking, rocking, floating

You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
