It's reborn
Fight with folded hands
Pain left below
The lifeless live again

Roar, roar, roar
Red cold river
Roar, roar, roar
Red cold river

I can't feel anything at all
This life has left me cold and down
I can't feel anything at all
This love has led me to the end

Stay reformed
Erase this perfect world
Hate left below
The dark stream war

Roar, roar, roar
Red cold river
I can't feel anything at all
This life has left me cold and down
I can't feel anything at all
This love has led me to the end
Roar, roar, roar
Red cold river

Try to find a reason to live
Try to find a reason to live
Try to find a reason to live

I can't feel anything at all
(Try to find a reason to live)
This life has left me cold and down
(Try to find a reason to live)
I can't feel anything at all
This love has let me to the end
Roar, roar, roar
Red cold river
