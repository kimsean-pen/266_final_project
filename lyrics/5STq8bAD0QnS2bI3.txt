Scratched a ticket
With a leg of a cricket
And I got triple Jesus
Cashed it in
For a Siamese twin
At the family firing range
Went to bed
And woke up inside another man's head
Nobody noticed
I'm so excited
The senator's a fighter

Don't tell me nothing's changed
Return to the moon
I'm dying

Return to the moon

Please
Bought a saltwater fish
From a colorblind witch cause
She said she loved it
Couldn't tell her the part
That would break her heart
But it loved me
She said, "I think you're
Getting too far from your

Family's house to find it
You should know if you're
Running away and I touch you
You freeze"
Return to the moon
I'm dying
Return to the moon
Please

Return to the moon
I'm dying

Return to the moon

Please
Don't make me wait for you
At the corner of Eden Park

Don't make me wait for you
At the Serpentine Wall
Wish I could have been there
When you were driving away
For California
If you've got to go somewhere

Then you better go somewhere
Far
Did you really think I could
Ever go on without you?

I'm not a genius
I imagine myself being cool
In the backseat

Of your car
Return to the moon
I'm dying
Return to the moon
Please

Return to the moon
I'm dying
Return to the moon
Please
Don't make me wait for you
At the corner of Eden Park
Don't make me wait for you
At the Serpentine Wall
