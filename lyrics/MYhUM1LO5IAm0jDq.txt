Lips like semaphore to my heart
We slither and slide and slip
Stings like aerosol in my eyes
And nothing compares to this

And it's ever so clear
And it's ever so plain
For the strangers, the strangers
And it's ever so clear
And it's ever so plain
For all the strangers out there

Pips from oranges spat away
To gutters and drains and bins
Left like promises on a tray
When you delivered yourself to him

And it's ever so clear
And it's ever so plain
For the strangers, the strangers
And it's ever so clear
And it's ever so plain
For all the strangers out there

A paper trail on the road
That was left for the gulls
And like the birds flying north
It's been growing cold

And it's ever so clear
And it's ever so plain
For the strangers, the strangers
And it's ever so clear
And it's ever so plain
For all the strangers out there

For all the strangers
For all the strangers out there
For all the strangers
For all the strangers out there
For all the strangers
For all the strangers out there
For all the strangers
For all the strangers out there
