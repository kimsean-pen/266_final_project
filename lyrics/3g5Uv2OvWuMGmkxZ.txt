Tonight
I want to give it all to you
In the darkness
There's so much I wanna do
And tonight
I want to lay it at your feet
'Cause boy I was made for you
And boy, you were made for me

I was made for lovin' you, baby
You were made for lovin' me
I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

Tonight
I want to see it in your eyes
And feel the magic
There's something that drives me wild
And tonight
We're gonna make it all come true
'Cause boy I was made for you
And boy, you were made for me

I was made for lovin' you, baby
You were made for lovin' me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

Tonight
I want to give it all to you
In the darkness
There's so much I wanna do
