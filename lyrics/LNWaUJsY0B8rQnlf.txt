If you want me, you would try
Now take your time, wasting time
Soon the patience's gonna dry
I'm chasin' life, faith is life

But I'm not wishing on maybes
Those don't turn into a thang
Yes, I'm angry and in pain, but know what
I could find a, another love
Another lover
Another lover (lover, lover, lover)
I could find a (lover, lover, lover)
Another lover (lover, lover, lover)
I could find a (lover, lover, lover)

Got too much on my plate
Too worry 'bout them love games
You wildin' out but [?]
Got too much on my plate
Too worry 'bout them love games
You wildin' out but [?]

Have me thinking it was fun
Let go of my pride, go of my pride, hmm
I'm regretting all those time
I hit you twice, [?] lies, ay

But I'm not wishing on maybes
Those don't turn into a thang
Yes, I'm angry and in pain, but know what
I could find a, another love
Another lover
Another lover (lover, lover, lover)
I could find a (lover, lover, lover)
Another lover (lover, lover, lover)
I could find a (lover, lover, lover)

Do your thing, I cannot change your ways
I'm escaping from this toxic place
Turn the page now it's different [?]
Hittin' my zone, [?], know where he come from, [?]

Another lover
Another lover
Another lover (lover, lover, lover)
I could find a (lover, lover, lover)
Hittin' my zone, [?], know where he come from, [?]
