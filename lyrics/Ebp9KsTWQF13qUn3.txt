Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
(Want you in my world)
But how can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl

What am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
(Want you in my world)
But how can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl

First time that I saw you boy
It was a warm and sunny day
All I know is I wanted you
I really hoped you'd looked my way
Then you smiled at me so warm and sweet
I could not speak
You make me feel like a lil bitty girl
What do you do to me

Now what am I supposed to do (now what you want me to do)
When I want you in my world
(Want you in my world)
But how can I want you for myself (oh no)
When I'm already someone's girl
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
No hard feelings
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
I'm gon' be there

Your energy, feels so damn good to me
It picks me up don't wanna come down
You got me spinning all around (oh) yeah
You need to know, I've got somebody
But, you're beautiful, shh
But still it ain't that type of party now

Now what am I supposed to do (what you want me to do)
When I want you in my world
(Want you in my world)
But how can I want you for myself (I can't help my feelings)
When I'm already someone's girl (oh no)

Now what am I supposed to do (I know)
When I want you in my world (I know I'm selfish but I)
(Want you in my world)
But how can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl (wait a minute)

I guess I'll see you next lifetime
Maybe we'll be butterflies
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
That sounds so divine
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
I guess I will now
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
Wait, wait a little while

See, it ain't nothin' wrong with dreamin'
But boy don't get me wrong
Cause every time (every time) I see you
(Every single time)
It lets me know just how strong
(Every single time)
That my love is for my baby
But emotions just don't lie
Well I know I'm a lot of woman
But not enough to divide my pie, ooh

Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
(Want you in my world)
But how can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl

I guess I'll see you next lifetime
You know I want to stay around
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
I'm so confused now

Now what am I supposed to do (what you want me to do)
When I want you in my world
(Want you in my world)
But how can I want you for myself
When I'm already someone's girl

I guess I'll see you next lifetime
I'm all ready, I'm gon' be there
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
I'm gon' look for you

Now what am I supposed to do (oh babe)
When I want you in my world (I got somebody right now)
(Want you in my world)
But how can I want you for myself (I, I)
When I'm already someone's girl (ohh... ohh.ohh... ohh... ohh)

I guess I'll see you next lifetime
Ohh, oh baby, oh baby
I guess I'll see you next lifetime

Now what am I supposed to do (what do you want me to do)
When I want you in my world
(Want you in my world)
But how can I want you for myself (I can't have you baby)
When I'm already someone's girl

I guess I'll see you next lifetime
Cuz what we got is so divine
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
Next time I'll make you mine, ooh
