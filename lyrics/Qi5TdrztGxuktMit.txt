I never claimed to be your saviour.
I said I had a dirty mouth.
Stop analysing my behaviour,
If you're too dumb to work it out.

I've got to keep myself together.
You know I hate to disappoint.
A masochistic lamb to slaughter,
Maybe you miss the point?

I'm feeling small.
Climbing the walls.
Don't let it show.

Now that you know what you know,
I bet you wish you could let it go.
You'll never come sucking your thumb.
Better off dumb.

Maybe I could write a letter
To help me with my self-esteem.
You should get to know me better.
No one's ever what they seem.

I'm feeling small.
Climbing the walls.
Don't let it show.

Now that you know what you know,
I bet you wish you could let it go.
You'll never come sucking your thumb.
Better off dumb.

You still don't know what you think of me.
You still don't know what you need from me.
You still don't know what to think of me.
You still don't know what you think of me.

Now that you know what you know,
I bet you wish you could let it go.
You'll never come sucking your thumb.
Better off dumb.

Now that you know what you know,
You're gonna reap what you sow.
Nothing will come sucking your thumb.
Better off dumb.

You still don't know what you think of me.
You still don't know what you mean to me.
You still don't know what to think of me.
You still don't know what you think of me.
You still don't know what you think of me.
You still don't know what you think of me.
You still don't know what you think of me.
You still don't know what you think of me.
You still don't know what I think of me.
You still don't know what you think of me.
