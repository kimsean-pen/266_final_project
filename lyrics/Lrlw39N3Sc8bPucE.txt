Down by that place you met her
I hope that you feel better
No worries here on out to me, it's all fine by me
So don't think too much about it
I hope that you don't doubt it
Leave everything alone for me

Damn that old serenade
Makes you worry bout she said
Makes you worry bout she said
Damn that old serenade
Makes you worry bout she said
Makes you worry bout she said

Down by that place you met her
I hope that you feel better
No worries here on out to me, it's all fine by me
So don't think too much about it
I hope that you don't doubt it
Leave everything alone for me

Damn that old serenade
Makes you worry bout she said
Makes you worry bout she said
But when it's time for this, you'll move along
A true romance cant last too long for me

Down by that place you met her
I hope that you feel better
No worries here on out to me, it's all fine by me
So don't think too much about it
I hope that you don't doubt it
Leave everything alone for me
