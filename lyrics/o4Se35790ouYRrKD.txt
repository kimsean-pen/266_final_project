Deck shoes, part green, part burgundy
Your size, gone gone gone
A healthy body, emergency, flesh of
Flesh gone gone

A mind of gold, joyful, careful
Bespoke, gone gone gone
All of every single urgency
Nothing gone gone gone

I'm washed up, washed out, the surf's up, I'm made of doubt
For what I need to say
Explain all has happened to me and you
It just won't wash with you, it won't wash with you
