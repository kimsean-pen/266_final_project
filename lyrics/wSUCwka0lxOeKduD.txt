I took a taxi
From LA to Venus in 1985
I was electromagnetically sucked back
Into the party going on that night

And it was the glory of the 80's
With karma drawn up in lines
And two bugle boy models saying
"Baby, it's a freebie you sure look deprived'

I had the Story of O in my bucket seat
And my wanna be Mustang
Auditioning for reptile
In their Raquel Welsh campaign

In the glories of the 80's
You said, "I'm not afraid to die"
I said, "I don't find that remotely funny
Even on this space cake high"

And then when it all seemed clear
Just then you go and disappear, disappear

Silicone party, Barbies to the left
And Joan of Arcs to the right
No one feeling insecure we were
All gorge and famous in our last lives

In the glories of the 80's
You said, 'The end is nothing to fear'
I said, "Blow the end, now, baby
Who do I gotta shag to get outta here"

And then when it all seemed clear
Just then you go and disappear, disappear

Sure you're out there orbiting around
Sure you're out there orbiting around
Wish I had you back now
Sure you're out there orbiting around
Sure you're out there orbiting around
Wish I had you back now

I met a drag king called Venus
She had a velvet hologram
She said, 'My husband ran off with my shaman
But they love me as I am"

In the glories of the 80's
I may not have to die
I'll clone myself like that blond chick
That sings Bette Davis Eyes

And then when it all seemed clear
Just then you go and

Sure you're out there orbiting around
Sure you're out there orbiting around
Wish I had you back now

And then when it all seemed clear
Just then you go and disappear, disappear

I took a taxi
From LA to Venus in 1980
1980, 1980, 1985
