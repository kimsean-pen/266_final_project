I count the falling tears
They fall before my eyes
Seems like a thousand years
Since we broke the ties

I call you on the phone
But never get a rise
So sit there all alone
It's time you realize

I'm not your fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's foooool
I'm no fooool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
Never again no no

You take your road I'll take mine
The paths have both been beaten
Searchin' for a change of pace
Life needs to be sweetened

I scream my heart out just to make a dime
And with that dime I bought your love
But now I've changed my mind

I'm not your fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
I'm no fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
Never again no no
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
I'm no fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool

I count the falling tears
They fall before my eyes
Seems like a thousand years
since we broke the ties

I'm not your fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
I'm no fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
I'm not your fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
I'm no fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool

Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
