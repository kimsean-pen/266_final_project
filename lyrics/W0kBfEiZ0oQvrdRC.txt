Kid, don't lose your cool
It's still too soon to have to choose a brighter doom
It's hard to believe
But I can see how there could be so little left to lose
Momma's not okay
She lights a candle for every day that you're away
Today could be the one she burns the motherfucker down
The final act of grace in a pointless endless race

Kid, you're under fire
Your life is coming down to the wire
Baby, you'll take the captains hand
Carry a ship through burning sands
Cradle your rifle like a man

Momma, she said to wait
She's lost it all, slowly got the stay to make you pay
She throws the fiend upon the floor to get those suckers full of stone
Till the day he dies alone

Succumb
Succumb
Succumb
Succumb
Succumb
Succumb
Succumb
Succumb
