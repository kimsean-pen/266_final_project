Take it slower, take it slower
Take it slower, take it slower

What's good for you, not good for me
Call it true clarity
Faded view, a window seat
What's good for you, not good for me

Ooh, the fields are swingin'
Ooh, the mountains ringin'
Ooh, I hear them prayin'
Swayin', so ever-changin'
Ooh, the buildings ringin' (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Them clouds singin' (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Ooh, I hear them prayin'
Swayin', so ever-changin' (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

Take it slower, take it slower
Take it slower, take it slower
Take it slower, take it slower
Take it slower, take it slower

Take it slower, take it slower
Take it slower, take it slower
Take it slower, take it slower
Take it slower, take it slower

Open up, open arms
One with you, nature's art
Got my view, these faded walks
What's good for you, not good for me

Ooh, the fields are swingin'
The mountains ringin'
Ooh, I hear them prayin'
Swayin', so ever-changin'
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh

Take it slower, take it slower
Take it slower, take it slower
Take it slower, take it slower
Take it slower, take it slower

So, I'm changin'
So (So, so, so)
So (So, so, so)
So (So, so, so)
So (So, so, so)
