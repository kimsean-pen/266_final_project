Landed alone in a city that used to love me
Running from a six month winter that wants me back
I know it's Summer
But Sydney's December is
More cold blooded than I remember and
These two bags are all that i have left

I got friend's.
They don't love me
Like I love them

I love them

A snap glance between yourselves
When I don't get it right
Where do you go when i'm around?
These days are like the old days but
You just care a little less
I don't blame you
I don't really like myself that much as well

Pack of cigarets didn't stand a chance
Domestic airport on my own
Welcome home

Daydreamer
No ones going to love you like you love them
It's like your old man said
It's not their fault
You're just different
Alone and different
