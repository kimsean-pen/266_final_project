Talk around your holiday
You know the details will always escape
But I tried to hang on every word
For something steady to remember
Stories to the scars only if I could recall where they were

"Don't hate yourself" makes sense if you're not
always fucking up even when you're sitting still
Calling home making sure I've not been a disappointment
Pour out just another drink maybe forgetting
tonight means rationing what little's left of my memories
I promise I am listening

Talk around your holiday
You know the details will always escape
But I tried to hang on every word
For something steady to remember
Stories to the scars only if I could recall where they were

I knew your eyes
Now they've closed
So with time
I'll forget that they were green
I let you beckon in the person that I am
In happiness I am incomplete
Remembering the fact you laid your own traps
Duality is that I've never broken any bones

Talk around your holiday
You know the details will always escape
But I tried to hang on every word
For something steady to remember
Stories to the scars only if I could recall
Only if I could recall where they were
