Waiting is like
We haven't the time for alright

Unraveled home, we are
pulled out our strings from hearts,
and shattered stars.
Slip through our fingertips
and lost on our pride's mind,
that season's gone.

We sit alone
Wait for the world to give up

Waiting is like
we haven't the time for alright,
but I'm here for you.
Living this lie
we haven't the time for alright,
but I'm here for you.

Live half a lie, we told
stories to grow close,
to what we owe.
Our friendly fire burns,
screaming to let you in
and come back home.

We sit alone
Wait for the world to give up

Waiting is like
we haven't the time for alright,
but I'm here for you.
Living this lie
we haven't the time for alright,
but I'm here for you.

Your heart circles my bones,
and steals my skin.
Leave it all buried within.
I stand the fool,
who follows the moon.
Leave me still hanging on
Leave me still hanging on
Leave me still hanging on

Waiting is like
we haven't the time for alright,
but I'm here for you.
Living this lie
we haven't the time for alright,
but I'm here for you.
Waiting is like
we haven't the time for alright,
(But I'm here for you)
Living this lie
we haven't the time for alright,
but I'm here for you.
