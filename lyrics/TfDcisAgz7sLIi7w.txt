There is a house built out of stone
Wooden floors, walls and window sills
Tables and chairs
Worn by all of the dust
This is a place where I don't feel alone
This is a place where I feel at home

And I built a home for you
For me
Until it dissapeared
From me
From you

And now it's time to leave and turn to dust

Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
There is a tree as old as me
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Ground had arose and passed its knees
By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
I climbed the tree to see the world

When the gusts came around to blow me down
I held on as tightly as you held on to me
I held on as tightly as you held on to me

And I built a home for you
For me
Until it dissapeared
From me
From you
And now it's time to leave and turn to dust
