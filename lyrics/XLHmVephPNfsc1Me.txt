All these people don't mean shit to me
I pay them no mind
In a world so sick I found the chosen few
We'll walk through fire 'til the end of time

Don't say a word
Don't need a reason why
Just point them out
Your enemies, they are mine

I'll do anything to keep you free from hurt
Your pain is mine
This is not misdirected trust
We'll walk through fire 'til the end of time

Don't say a word
Don't need a reason why
Just point them out
Your enemies, they are mine

Tear down everything that you love
Take away all your self-worth
I'll bring you damage, I owe you pain
I pray to watch you burn
Tear down everything that you love
Take away all your self-worth
I'll bring you damage, I owe you pain
I pray to watch you burn
