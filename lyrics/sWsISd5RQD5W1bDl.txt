My sweetness
Where do you go?
When your friends tell me that you're out
When you told me you're at home
So I follow
You into the ground
I'll follow you anywhere, my baby
I'll follow you round and round

Smoke my last cigarette
You run me dry
And I try and catch your name
You leave me wondering why
You got my heart
With just one look
As I laid my eyes on you, yeah
You read me like a book
Don't take me for a fool
'Cause I'm not a pretty fool
I may seem kind to you
But I'll rip your heart in two
(I'll rip your heart out)

My sweetness
Where do you go?
When your friends tell me that you're out
You got me on my tip-toes
I'll follow
You into the ground
I'll follow you anywhere, my baby
Yeah, I'll follow you round and round

Dance around my room
In your underwear
Oh, you look at me like you
You just don't really care
I loved you madly
All the time
I loved you madly, yeah
I loved you blind

Don't take me for a fool
Yeah, I'm not your petty fool
I may seem kind to you
But I'll rip your heart in two
(Oh no)

My sweetness
Where do you go?
When your friends tell me that you're out
You got me on my tip-toes
I'll follow
Yeah, you into the ground
I'll follow you anywhere, my baby
I'll follow you round and round

Mrs. Infamous
Mrs. Infamous
Mrs. Infamous
Mrs. Infamous

Yeah, I finally figured out
What I'm singing about
About a guy, that loves a girl so much
He's gonna put her in the ground
(No, really)

My sweetness
Where do you you go?
When your friends tell me that you're out
You got me on my tip-toes
I'll follow
Yeah, you into the ground
I'll follow you anywhere, my baby
Yeah, I'll follow you round and round

Mrs. Infamous
Mrs. Infamous
Mrs. Infamous
Mrs. Infamous
