There's always something, somewhere
That's running through my mind
I know it's going nowhere but I still chase it
There's always something, somewhere, that I'm supposed to find
It's like a piece is missing, and I can't place it

But I wanna fell the ocean's spray
Drink in the sun as it surrounds me
But something, somewhere's always pulling me away

Stay deep in the moment, just breathe
Feel the flow of all things in the moment's sway
Why don't you stay?

There's always something, somewhere
That's breathing down my neck
And I could run forever and never shake it
There's always something, somewhere
That's pressing on my chest
And I don't really know if I'm gonna make it

But I wanna feel the wind's embrace
Each blade of grass between my fingers
But something, somewhere's always pulling me away

Stay deep in the moment, just breathe
Feel the flow of all things in the moment's sway
Why don't you...
Stay deep in the moment, just breathe
Feel the flow of all things in the moment's sway
Why don't you stay?
Why don't you stay?

But something, somewhere's always pulling me away
Why don't you stay?
Why don't you stay?

(Stay deep in the moment, just breathe)
(Feel the flow of all things in the moment's sway)
(Why don't you stay?)

Stay deep in the moment, just breathe
Feel the flow of all things in the moment's sway
Why don't you...
Stay deep in the moment, just breathe
Feel the flow of all things in the moment's sway
Why don't you stay?
