I write mostly on hotel paper
Knowing that my thoughts will never leave this room
I'd be out of line telling you, "leave her"
So I lie lonely surrouded by you (by you)

Lately I can't be happy for no one
They think I need some time to myself
I try to smile but I can't remember
I know tomorrow there'll be nothing else

And I, I wanted to be
Giving you everything she's not giving
And I, I wanted to see
Cause I didn't believe what I'd been hearing

You turned out to be more than I bargined for
And I can tell that you need to get away
Forgive me if I admit that I'd love to love you
We both realized it was way too late

And I, I wanted to be
Giving you everything she's not giving
And I, I wanted to see
Cause I didn't believe what I've been hearing

Maybe this wind blowing in just came from the ocean
