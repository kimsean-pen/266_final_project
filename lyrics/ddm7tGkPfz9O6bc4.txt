Heavenly shades of night are falling
It's twilight time
Out of the mist your voice is calling
'Tis twilight time

When purple colored curtains
Mark the end of the day
I hear you my dear at twilight time

Deepening shadows gather splendor
As day is done
Fingers of night will soon surrender
The setting sun

I count the moments darling
Till you're here with me
Together at last at twilight time

Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendez-vous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then

Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
Like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me
With dreams untold

Each day I pray for evening just
To be with you
Together at last at twilight time

Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendez-vous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then

Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
Like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me
With dreams untold

Each day I pray for evening just
To be with you
Together at last at twilight time
Together at last at twilight time
