He was throwing grain into the ground below, ground below
With dreary circles of his arm, going slow, very slow
His cap pulled down round his ears
To hide the smile and watery tears

My loving wife, it's so wonderful
How small seeds gracefully do grow
Into beautiful things that spring from these rows
With their musical names and musical sounds

Dreary birds parade across the dreary sky, but down below
The woman absent mindedly begins to sow, how she sows
The seeds her husband loved so much
But he's no longer here with us

But her life is so beautiful as memories continue to grow
Into beautiful things that spring from these rows
With their musical names and musical sounds
And this beautiful things that spring from these rows
With their musical names and musical sounds, and musical sounds

Distant though I am orange, gold and green
Firing, flaming, colors surround me
I'm always wondering where you are
I'm always wondering where you are

Darling shouldn't I be the one?
Wondering after all I'm the one who is gone
I'm always wondering where you are
I'm always wondering where you are

Darling shouldn't I be the one?
Wondering after all I'm the one who is gone
I'm always wondering, I was just wondering
I was just wondering, I'm the one who is gone, who is gone

But, there's beautiful things that spring from these rows
With their musical names and musical sounds, and musical sounds
