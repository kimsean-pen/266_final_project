Work all day, as men who know
Wheels must turn to keep, to keep the flow

Build on up, don't break the chain
Sparks will fly, when the whistle blows

Never stop the action
Keep it up, keep it up

Work to the rhythm
Live to the rhythm
Love to the rhythm
Slave To The Rhythm

Axe to wood, in ancient time
Man machine, power line

Fires burn, heart beats strong
Sing out loud, the chain gang song

Never stop the action
Keep it up, keep it up

Breath to the rhythm
Dance to the rhythm
Work to the rhythm
Live to the rhythm
Love to the rhythm
Slave To The Rhythm
