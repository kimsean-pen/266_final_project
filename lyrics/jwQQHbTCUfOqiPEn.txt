Kiss the blade of sharp, cold steel
Hold your breath when I die
I will leave my mark
You will know when I go

Living in the shadows
Crawling in the dark
Another face – you will never see
Another voice – you will never hear

Erase my mortal shell
To feed my dying soul
Morbid glory shines on me
I will leave my mark

You will know
When I go
You will see
Exist to exit

Suicide - Escape oblivion
Kiss the blade of sharp, cold steel
The perfect day for my final exit
Hold your breath when I die

Art, action, reincarnation
Evolution through ritual death
Reborn as an infamous legend
Forever immortal, post-mortem fame

You will know
When I go
You will see
Exist to exit

You will know
When I go
You will see
Exist to exit
