Well you got me boy
Feeling just like a fool
Hey I'm not your toy
Don't you treat me cruel

Don't you stop me now
Doing what I wanna do
Boy, you're out of line

Now this life is mine
I can do it alone
And I'm feeling fine
Now I'm here on my own

Don't you see my eyes
Are looking 'round for something new
Boy you're out of line

I can't live another day with you
Another day with you

Well I've seen the light
And I'm getting out soon

Cause you've tired me out
And my loving is through

I can tell no lies
There is nothing left for you
Boy you're out of line

Now this life is mine
I can do it alone
And I'm feeling fine
Now I'm here on my own

Don't you see my eyes
Are looking 'round for something new
Boy you're out of line
