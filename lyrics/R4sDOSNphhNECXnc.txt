Every storm in the sky,
Started out light,
Started out light.

And the cold and I,
We're both outside,
We're both outside.

Oh lady I, I have met you,
So alone oh, I know,
Oh lady I, softly aloud,
Sang the words of some drowned song.

And so, how long,
Must I await you,
And the sun that won't come out.

Oh lady I, I'll forget you,
I alone know cold nights,
Oh lady I, I'll regret you,
In time, oh in time.
