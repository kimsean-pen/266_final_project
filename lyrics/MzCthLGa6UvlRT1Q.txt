Life means more since I stopped thinking
Life means more because you keep me going
I dreamed that we had another moment, still
We could be the champions of art
I killed myself because I was stupid
Great things come, but only as a blessing
It took so long because nobody told me
The Son of God is nothing more than this

I think I have it, I'm an angel
Humbled as such to learn from you
the truth of Life is never spoken
And sleep hasn't ever done me any good yet

Sleep is a curse
Remember that moment the music led
our dying minds to Heaven?
The promises of Life are tragic
The one for me will never have those things
That night, the forest was seething
So many things, but her face was all I saw
You're so good, your face is all I see.

I think I have it, I'm an angel
Humbled as such to learn from you
The truth of Life is never spoken
And sleep hasn't ever done me any good yet
