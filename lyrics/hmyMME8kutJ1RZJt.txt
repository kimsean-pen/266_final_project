Silence is a frustrating answer
When all you want is a sign
Silence is a frustrating answer
When all you wanted is a sign

It's hard to be surrounded by the ones that you love
When they keep passing you by (passing you by)

Beneath the tough facade
I know that we are getting through
None of us are ready to just remember you

Whenever you are lost, I know that we can find you
Standing outside screaming at the sky

Don't let the tears of agony consume your heart
Let it beat on in hopes and dreams of a new start

No one knows the weight on your shoulders
No one knows the burdens you bear
These thoughts won't stop

It'd be so easy to take the easy way out
It'd be so easy to take the easy way out

Compassion is a beautiful thing, so show some for yourself
Rock solid from the outside looking in
Rock solid from the outside looking in
Inside you're praying for help
Rock solid from the outside looking in
You're praying for help

It's hard to be surrounded by the ones that you love
When they keep passing you by (passing you by)

Beneath the tough facade
I know that we are getting through
Life is a gift
Remember this, remember this

Break free
Break free
Break free

I know silence is a hard answer
When all you want is a sign
Patience is a virtue (a virtue)
You will be revived
