Come to me, come to me
Come to me, come to me

Come to me, come to me
You're the only one
Give me love, give me love
From dusk till dawn
Come to me, come to me
Boy, we can get along
Give me love, give me love
From dusk till dawn

Falling through the floor
Baby, this is Devil's door
Burning in the flame
Wanna know my secret

Bang!

I'm so high
Love me, love me, love me boy
I'm so fine
Love me, love me, love me boy

Falling through the floor
Baby, this is Devil's door

Come to me, come to me
You're the only one
Give me love, give me love
From dusk till dawn
Come to me, come to me
Following my voice
Give me love, give me love
You don't have a choice

Do you know me?
Let's take it really slowly
Falling through the floor
Ask the Devil's door
You gotta know me
Just get the rhythm slowly
Burning in the flame
Wanna know my secret

Bang!

I'm so high
Love me, love me, love me boy
I'm so fine
Love me, love me, love me boy
I'm so high
Love me, love me, love me boy
I'm so fine
Love me, love me, love me boy

Bang!
