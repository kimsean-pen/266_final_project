Skyscrapers please forgive me I didn't mean a word I said
Skyscrapers I was just tangled up in my own head
And somehow in all the madness I thought that I was seeing straight

It ain't always pretty but it seemed there was no other way
And I guess all I ever loved was standing right before my eyes
And I, oh I, I was blind

So skyscrapers please forgive me I'm standing here repentative man
Oh skyscrapers I'll never look down again, again
Oh 'cause I guess all I ever loved was standing right before my eyes

Oh yeah, I guess all I've ever known was standing,
was standing, was standing here all the time
And I, yeah I, I was blind
I was blind
I was blind

You were right here all the time
You were right here all the time
I was blind
I was blind
I was blind
