Lord Of The Flies (Harris, Gers) (Commentary)
I don't care for this world anymore, I just want to live my own fantasy
Fate has brought us to these shores, what was meant to be is now happening
I've found that I like this living in danger
Living on the edge it feels, it makes feel as one
Who cares now what's right or wrong, it's reality
Killing so we survive wherever we may roam
Wherever we may hide, we've got to get away
I don't want existence to end, we must prepare ourselves for the elements
I just want to feel like we're strong, we don't need a code of morality
I like all the mixed emotion and anger
It brings out the animal, the power you can feel
And feeling so high with this much adrenaline
Excited but scary to believe what we've become
Saints and sinners, something within us
We are lord of the flies
Saints and sinners, something willing us
To be lord of the flies
(3: 17-Solo: Janick Gers)
Saints and sinners, something within us
We are lord of the flies
Saints and sinners, something willing us
To be lord of the flies
Saints and sinners, something within us
We are lord of the flies
Saints and sinners, something willing us
To be lord of the flies
