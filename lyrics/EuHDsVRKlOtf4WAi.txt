(Nobody close to me
move a little close to me, close to me)

Hey lil' fella', get you're show together
I was listening before, now I don't care no more
Look around now (look around now)
It's always that is gonna get me down
It's only begun...

One look, is all it took
Uhhh I remember, that sweet surrender
I recall, do you
That sweet surrender

Sweet surrender

My determination
Came a creepin' across the nation
A sure mistake for any one
So you can take home everyone
Cos it's only just begun

One look, is all it took
Uhhh to remember, that sweet surrender
And I recall, do you
That sweet surrender

I don't know, I don't care
Cos I'm living without you baby
And even when I know what's going on, yeah
All it took...

One look, one glance
Uhhh you set my heart, set for romance
Do you believe, my sweet
Surrender
My sweet surrender

Listen

Hey lil' fella', now your show's together
I never wanted you to listen before
So why should I walk out of the door
Stick around now (stick around now)
And so the story goes on through the night
It's only begun...

One look, is all it took
Uhhh I remember, that sweet surrender
Do you recall, cos IIIII do
My sweet surrender

I don't know, I don't care
Cos I'm living without you baby
Even when I know what's goooing on, yeah
All it takes...

One look, one glance
Uhhh to set my heaaart for romance
One look is all it took
My sweet surrender
My sweet surrender

One look
is all it took
to remember
to remember

Listen

(I don't know, I don't care)

Oh no no no no no no

*FADING*

(I don't know, I don't care)

My sweet surrender
