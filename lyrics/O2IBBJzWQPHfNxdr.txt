Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darlin
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Or am I only dreaming
Is this burning, an eternal flame

I believe
It's meant to be, darling
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong to me
Do you feel the same
Or am I only dreaming
Is this burning, an eternal flame

Say my name, sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
Then come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling, oooh

Oh oh

Say my name, sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
Now come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling, oooh

Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Or is this burning, an eternal flame

Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand (do you understand)
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming (dreaming)
Or is this burning, an eternal flame

Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darling (Give me your hand)
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand (Give me your hand)
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming (dreaming)
Is this burning, an eternal flame
