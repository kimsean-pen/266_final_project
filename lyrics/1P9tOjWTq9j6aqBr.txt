I try to count my blessings, lying on my couch
Tiny little pieces falling out my mouth
I try to break my bones to fit inside the spaces
The smallest confines of what I created

It's how I rest my head on your chest
And the combination of guilt and regret
I will learn to suspect
It's my fault I can't rest
Anymore, more

Try to come up
Try to come up
Try to come up, come up
Try to come up, come up

Tell myself it's love when I can't sleep alone
I tell myself enough when I know it's not home

It's how I rest my head on your chest
And the combination of guilt and regret
I will learn to suspect
It's my fault I can't rest
Anymore, more
It's how I rest my head on your chest
And the combination of guilt and regret
I will learn to expect
That you're gone
I can't rest anymore, more

Try to come up
Try to come up, come up
Try to come up
Try to come up, come up
Try to come up, come up
Try to close my eyes
Try to come up, come up
Try to close my eyes
Try to come up, come up
Try to close my eyes
Try to come up, come up
Try to close my eyes

It's how I rest my head on your chest
And the combination of guilt and regret
I will learn to suspect
It's my fault I can't rest
Anymore, more
It's how I rest my head on your chest
And the combination of guilt and regret
I will learn to expect
That you're gone
I can't rest
Anymore, more

Try to come up
Try to come up, come up
More
Try to come up, come up
Try to come up
More
Try to come up
Try to come up, come up
More
Try to come up
Try to come up, come up
More
