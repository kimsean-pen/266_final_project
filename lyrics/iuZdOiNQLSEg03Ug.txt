Leave me with no words
If you call again, subside
And I know I've made it all a lie
Shuffled back and forth, it's only in my eyes
And I always wanted to resit
Everything I bought into is no man
Fool me once, it's fair
The floodgates leave me there
I count on you in a way
There's nothing left besides
And I want to hide it all away
Taking back all of the silly things I used to say
And I'll give you all of my time
Because I'm foolish and never know how to resign
Looking back and forth, turn around
One that makes no sense but feels good anyhow
And I'll leave it all as it should be
Where you are you and I stay me
