Head on fire
Turns you on to be loved like that
Any higher
Makes you feel you could be loved less

In your eyes
I see the ones - made a mess
Crucifying
You'll run away the rest of your life girl

Make us feel like a drug
More like it was
Hold out your hand
Take all this love

Truly, I don't know what they did
Gotta to do with me
Truly, I don't know what he did
Got to do with me?
Got to do with me?

Eh yeeh
I need you for the rest of my life girl
Eh yeeh
Try to get the best of your life girl

Morning comes
Stars that drip shy, hideaway
Black to orange
Through the blue light, you orchestrate

In your eyes
I've become
Just like them
Like clouds that grey
The hours of the rest of your day girl

Make us feel like a drug
More like it was
Hold out your hand
Take all this love

Truly, I don't know what they did
Gotta to do with me
Truly, I don't know what he did
Got to do with me?
Got to do with me?

Eh yeeh
I need you for the rest of my life girl
Eh yeeh
Try to get the best of your life girl

Truly, I don't know what they did
Gotta to do with me
Truly, I don't know what he did
Got to do with me?
Got to do with me?

Eh yeeh
I need you for the rest of my life girl
Eh yeeh
Try to get the best of your life girl

Behind the lashes
Are tears and little flashes
And from the corner
You Overflow

Behind the lashes
Are tears and little flashes
And from the corner
You overflow

Truly, I don't know what they did
Gotta to do with me
I Don't know what
Truly, I don't know what he did
Got to do with me?
Got to do with me?

Eh yeeh
I need you for the rest of my life girl
Eh yeeh
Try to get the best of your life girl
