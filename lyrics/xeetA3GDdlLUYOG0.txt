We wonder through each others lives
Just like the rivers, constant flow
And signs of life in all our eyes
Keep this city on the go

The sun will rise, the sun will set
Seven days, five and two
From this life in to the next
We're all just tryna make it through
We're all just tryna make it through

In every class, in every school
At every desk where time's well spent
Waking up to break the rules
Waiting for the week to end

The same old tale repeats itself
9-5 year on year
Thoughts and hopes left on the shelf
Escape on Friday
Get caught on Monday
Escape on Friday
Get caught on Monday

The sun will rise, the sun will set
Seven days, five and two
From this life in to the next
We're all just tryna make it through
We're all just tryna make it through
