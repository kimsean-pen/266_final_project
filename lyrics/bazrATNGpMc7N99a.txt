I'm thinking deeper now that my eyes are red
Breathing in the clouds cause I'm over it
There is nothing I have to answer for
'Cause I am not faced by them anymore
Will you ever know the truth hidden from yourself
Keep your heart away for your mental health
'Cause I know you understand how it goes

It's the only time of day I'm always
It's the only thing I feel thats always
If or only you can feel this with me
Maybe it will change your mind and tell me

I'm counting down the days until you realize
That you can't pretend to know without open eyes
Take this chance to understand how it goes

It's the only time of day I'm always
It's the only thing I feel that's always
If or only you can feel this with me
Maybe it will change your mind and tell me

She pulled me in and said:
Oh darling you're right
You need to fix yourself
I thought I told you last time
I'm going back again
You can't change my mind
You never made no sense

It's the only time of day I'm always
Its the only thing I feel thats always

It's the only time of day I'm always
It's the only thing I feel thats always
If or only you can feel this with me
Maybe it will change your mind and tell me
