I'll look around just for today
Except that's fun to say, you know, every thought
It's what you get, they told me that
It's for a while, it seemed a dream
I hear your voice instead of mine
Just for one or two seconds long, looked like forever so
I think I'm bored
I hear your voice inside a dream
I hear your voice inside of what I thought was a dream
Hoping to never end everyone and so

Call me, forever be
Call me, forever (everyone)
Call me, forever (everyone)
Call me, forever

Forever be
Forever be
Forever be
Forever be

Just for a while inside of me
I hear your voice inside a dream
Just for a while inside of me
I hear your voice inside a dream
I'll look around just for today
Instead of staring at everyone, open your eyes
And what for? You could say
I'll never be as everyone, hoping to hide that I'm
Bored, don't think that's true
Because of you, don't say that's true
I hear your voice inside of what I thought was a dream
Hoping to never end, hoping to never end
