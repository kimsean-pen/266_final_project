White turns to black
空が 少しずつ淀んでく
待ち受ける未来を写す
The coat of paint that you had drawn on me will wash away
流れる涙も雨と一緒に
消えていく with all of your colour tonight

精一杯逃げても no change 拒んでみても
I know now that it's gonna follow me

How can I stop the rain?
Somebody close the gate
この雨を止ませる様に教えてくれ
I'll do anything

The clouds are rushing in
Everything fading grey
The lights 絶望の中に吸い込まれてく

君の笑顔が消えたその瞬間
空は黒い雲に覆われた
君がいない明日を嘆くだろう

Somehow thought I was climbing over, I can't feel me now
I'm getting deeper and my cries are drowning out
このまま終わるのか oh no

No change 拒んでみても
I know now that the ending will stay the same

How can I stop the rain?
Somebody close the gate
この雨を止ませる様に教えてくれ
I'll do anything

How could I've stopped the end?
There's nowhere left to stay
Baby, you paint over my life
Without you, don't really know if I'll be alright

The clouds are rushing in
Everything fading grey
The lights 絶望の中に吸い込まれてく
