From chaos to eternity
Dead space all around
Grey shades, not one sound
Dark thoughts, half-alive
Chaos born, life denied

Dead space all around
Grey shades, not one sound
Dark thoughts, half-alive
Chaos born, life denied

I'll live!
(Make me live)
I'll feel!
(Let me feel)
I'll be!
(Make me be)
Set me free

(Save my soul)
I need him, I see him
A new emotion fills me

(Save my world)
Inside me, beyond me
Expanding to his cosmic will

AN ANGEL SPOKE
HIS SOUL WILL SOAR FROM RUINS OF HATE
SILENT PAIN, ENDLESS WAR
LED FROM CHAOS TO ETERNITY
MORTAL DESTINY
HIS BLEEDING RHYME OF DIVINE TRAGEDY
A NEW TRACE OF HOPE IS CARVED IN HIM
THE SECRET OF MY UNIVERSE, MY SIN

From chaos to eternity
Darkened entity
Chasing loneliness
Nowhere I can hide
One choice: truth or lie?
