Oh no, it's me
Caught up again
Inside my tomb
Making plans
I give you more
Than I have
This wrecking game
Feels so bad

Who can see behind their eyes?
Who can tell what is wrong or true?
Is it just you?
To hold out till the end, alone
Must I own my will
To be strong and hang on

I will hang on
When the rains come
And wash away
All I've come from
The burning spear
Of desire
No longer takes me
Any higher

Who can see behind their eyes?
Who can tell what is wrong or true?
Let it be you
From the start
Cause you know what to live for
Never goes, it just knows
And makes you move on

I will hang on
I will hang on

Oh, I feel free
When idle time no longer coils
'round this heart of mine
I now can see
What light looks like
The battlefield's
Just in your mind

Who can see behind their eyes?
Who can tell what is wrong or true?
Let it be you
To be pushed
And to never stop giving
You must own your will
To be strong and hang on
To be strong
