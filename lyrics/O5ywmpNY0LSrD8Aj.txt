You think you know what you want
But you don't
You think you know how to love
But you don't
Is that really what you call love
You are too selfish for that
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I've conquered the sun
I'm out of here hun

King of the heart
King of the gun
King of the sea oh (sailing away)
Gotta be brave
Better nourish the roots of your ego
That you slowly caress

Don't mess with tarot
The cards they will speak
I pull thee empress
Inside my sleeve
Told you that I was the one of your dreams
Watching you when you're asleep

Stop, leaving chases
You had your chances
Oh close in my chambers
Oh you, oh you, oh you
You are dangerous

King of the heart
King of the gun
King of the sea oh (sailing away)
Gotta be brave
Better nourish the roots of your ego
That you slowly caress
