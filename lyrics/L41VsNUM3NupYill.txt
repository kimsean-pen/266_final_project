They say that thirteen is just a number
A double agent funded in the secret of the hive
And the workers and their lives
All sweet and honeycombed
A hunger ravenous and funded incognito

Razor burns talcum powered fingerprints
All sweet and honeycombed
Go stick your tongue on the North Pole
Read the graffiti splattered on the convertible

This bullet x-marked the rumors
Jet-lagged, stab you with this pitchfork

Forget, forget, forget
All sweet and honeycombed
Forget, forget, forget
Sweet and honeycombed

Forget, forget, forget
All sweet and honeycombed
Forget, forget, forget

Part your hair on the grassy knoll
A cavity of candy in Havana captivity
We heard the mug shots, a patsy inclined
Let the pollen make you sneeze

All sweet and honeycombed
All sweet and honeycombed
All sweet and honeycombed
All sweet and honeycombed

Forget, forget, forget
All sweet and honeycombed
Forget, forget, forget
All sweet and honeycombed

"Hasta la Victoria Siempre"
Manana hay misa para los sordos
"Hasta la Victoria Siempre"
Manana hay misa para los sordos
Victoria Siempre

Forget, forget, forget
All sweet and honeycombed
Forget, forget, forget
All sweet and honeycombed

Forget, forget, forget
All sweet and honeycombed
