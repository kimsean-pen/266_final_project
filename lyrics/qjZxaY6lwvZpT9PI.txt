Make this and reshape it
Pictures of some cute girls' faces
Some sort of stupid inspiration,
while we're running, running down
Graze until the grass is brown, then just leave it

Spilled my guts from my chest
It's like there's less and less left

You know I really want to
be unconditioned
You know I really want to
turn & go & turn
You know I really want to
be completely different
You know I really want to
really know it all

Reshape and erase this
Funny people, funny places
It's boring everything is shapeless
While we're running, running down
