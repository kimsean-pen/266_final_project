I know the outcome
and I'm not blind
I've been standing right here before
and I do it every time

I never think I'll lose
but it's a losing game
and I'm breaking all the rules
thinking that I'm gonna change

Oh, it's good
that these men don't know each other
I got one who's working undercover
trying to solve my mystery

Look at what mistake
I'm making now
I'm jumping right on in
When I know it's gonna end somehow
(cause you know it, cause you know it)
Look at what mistake
I'm making now
I'm jumping right on in

When I know it's gonna end somehow
I've told these stories
and I've said these lies
I ignore what my heart tells me

and I break it every time
I never think I'll lose
but it's a losing game
and I'm breaking all the rules

thinking that I'm gonna change
Oh, it's good
that these men don't know each other
Well, every time I lose one, I can just move on

I always find another
Look at what mistake
I'm making now
I'm jumpin' right on in
When I know it's gonna end somehow
('cause you know it, 'cause you know it)
Look at what mistake
I'm making now
I'm jumpin' right on in
When I know it's gonna end somehow
(cause you know it, cause you know it, cause you know it's gonna end somehow)
Look at what mistake
I'm making now
Cause I know it
Cause I know it's gonna end somehow, yeah
Look at what mistake
I'm making now
Cause I know it
Cause I know it's gonna end somehow
Look at what mistake
I'm making now
Cause I know it
Cause I know it's gonna end somehow
