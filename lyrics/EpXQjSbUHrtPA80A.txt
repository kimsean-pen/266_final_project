4AM and I hear that cry
Look through the curtain but no sign of life
She stumbles, longing over
All the secrets she hides
And suddenly sweeps it all under the rug

How many times have I heard that sound?
The hair on the back of my neck stands tall
Everybody slowly starts closing the blinds
Am I the only one who can recognize?

I hope I never become him
Stuck behind the morning light
I've had enough to define me, yeah

WATCHING, WAITING
Black and white surveillance
I hope that nothing's going wrong
I hope that nothing's going wrong

And when he sees me look him eye-to-eye
Only in the off-hand chance that he strikes
A pantomime motion where I am
Miscast a play in the antemasque

I hope I never become him
Stuck behind the morning light
I've had enough to define me, yeah

WATCHING, WAITING
Black and white surveillance
I hope that nothing's going wrong
I hope that nothing's going

WATCHING, WAITING
Black and white surveillance
I hope that nothing's going wrong
I hope that nothing's going wrong

Sharp shock
Yeah, I'm gonna put up
Never looking back
Never looking back
Sharp shock
Yeah, I'm gonna put up
Never looking back
Never looking back
Sharp shadow
Break that mirror
Never looking back
I'm never looking back
Yeah, I'm never looking back

WATCHING, WAITING
Black and white surveillance
I hope that nothing's going wrong
I hope that nothing's going

WATCHING, WAITING
Black and white surveillance
I hope that nothing's going wrong
I hope that nothing's going wrong
