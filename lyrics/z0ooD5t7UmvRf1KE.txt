House full of angled mirrors
Navigate as forms bend shift and change
Stretched thin, cracked glass reflection
Sent back from which you once remained
Unable to decipher
Traits and facets- funhouse antics
Oaths and shadows lead way to stagnance
Not so fun now, constant imbalance

I'm found and lost, distorted and shaped
In vision and action, we can not escape

I'm crawling my way back to you, my love
From the depths of this bottomless pit
Enveloped by every obstacle
Seeking level ground that does not exist
Night shades have burned down before my very eyes
The carnival has passed and left
With every empty night in my heart and soul
I have contended with every last breath

Restless hand grenade
With a penchant for being used
Complicated, albeit atropheied
Bearing salt for endless wounds

I'm crawling my way back to you, my love
From the depths of this bottomless pit
Enveloped by every obstacle
Seeking level ground that does not exist
Night shades have burned down before my very eyes
The carnival has passed and left
With every empty night in my heart and soul
I have contended with every last breath

I'm crawling my way back to you, my love
From the depths of this bottomless pit
Enveloped by every obstacle
Seeking level ground that does not exist
