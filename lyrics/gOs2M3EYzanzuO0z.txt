I know your kind
The same as mine
You wear a smile
With frown combined

We see the end
Every second
What a waste
What good taste

I see you mourning the moment
While in the midst of the moment
Some have a tendency for it
And don't we love each other for it

We're always mourning the moment
While in the midst of the moment
(ooooh)
Fatalist love
(ooooh)
Fatalist love

Why must things end so bad
After all the good times had
Sentiment doesn't help
But still I can't help myself

I see you mourning the moment
While in the midst of the moment
Some have a tendency for it
And don't we love each other for it

We're always mourning the moment
While in the midst of the moment
(ooooh)
Fatalist love
(ooooh)
Fatalist love
(ooooh)
My fatalist love
