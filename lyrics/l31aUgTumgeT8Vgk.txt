I am a king of honor
Gold and glory
But every king must also die
Have I been just and righteous
What is glory
I know I've torn and taken life

And here I stand
A small and simple man

Who will trade his karma for my kingdom
A sacrificial rite to render truth
The fire in my soul rejects my wisdom
Cause all you do in life comes back to you

I am a king in crisis
Counting minutes
There is an ending to my reign
My sins have come to face me
I can feel it
That I have lived my life in vain

And now I know I'll reap
The seeds I've sown

Who will trade his karma for my kingdom
A sacrificial rite to render truth
The fire in my soul rejects my wisdom
Cause all you do in life comes back to you

Am I mad
I feel so void and cold
Who can tell
Who holds the stories untold
Tired and trembling
I am descending
Will I have to stay here
And live this life again
Who will trade his karma for my kingdom
A sacrificial rite to render truth
The fire in my soul rejects my wisdom
Cause all you do in life comes back to you
