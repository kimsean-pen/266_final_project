So bold and fine
I've known you for some time
Whole life changed while
Bones like yours and mine
Go dance in the woods and
Down we go, down, down
Oh boy, you're mine
Do you remember old times?

Oh dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh dear boy, it's so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do

Oh dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh dear boy, so shallow without you
It's our time for everything and I call you

Sweet love of mine, destruction ain't a crime
For those who find love as a game like you and I
Go dance in the waters of all the tears we've cried
Oh boy, you're fine, do you remember old times?

Oh dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh dear boy, it's so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do

Oh dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh dear boy, so shallow in the blue
It's our time for everything and I call you
