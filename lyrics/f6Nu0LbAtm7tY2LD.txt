There's something missing here lately
I sense it when the sun goes down
Caught myself slip into a daydream
You went away and pulled me out
I heard you were thinking of leaving
I promise it won't feel so long
One thing you needed was healing
But now that you're gone, what can I fall back on?

I feel it all around, were you calling out?
I hate myself for never being there to help
I feel it all around (Your time was running out)
Your last breath I'll never forget

Is death a normal thing to fear?
Does the hurt and the love disappear?
Sometimes I pretend like you're still here
Will you meet me in the troposphere?

Will I ever learn to grow?
Is it something I'll never know?
What if I'm not strong enough?
What if I can't do this?
Do I let go of the pain I feel or battle through it?
(Now that you're gone)

I feel it all around, you were calling out
I wish I could've been there for you
I feel it all around (Your time was running out)
Your last breath I'll never forget

Is death a normal thing to fear?
Does the hurt and the love disappear?
Sometimes I pretend like you're still here
Will you meet me in the troposphere?

Please stay, will you wait?
(Will you wait, will you wait for me?)
Please stay, will you wait?
(Before it's too late)

Is death a normal thing to fear?
Does the hurt and the love disappear?
Sometimes I pretend like you're still here
Will you meet me in the troposphere?

I feel it all around, you were calling out
I wish I could've been there for you
I feel it all around (Your time was running out)
Your last breath I'll never forget
