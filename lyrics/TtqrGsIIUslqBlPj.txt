The words made flesh
And I could touch their skin
A landscape of desperation
No great army, no soldier of fortune
Could get me through that day
The action was so revealing
That the feeling will never go away
Hold on to me and I'll give you
my pulse
I find the need so appealing
Untie the knots in my soul

Until I feel the secret unveiling
I reach up for any face
I was never good at concealing
But I have the nerve I've pushed before
If only to bury the fear
You wear a coat of armour
I'll take the chance
And break through that shield
Hold onto me I'll give you my pulse
I find myself reaching too far
