Ace on an unbroken line
Ace of hearts
Mariner of the time
Another ace of hearts
Sweet possessions of cards
That you take
From each Victoria box
That you break

You break the ace of hearts
But break too much
Hearts that cannot be refused
On your watch
Break the ace of hearts

You should draw closer to me
Ace of hearts
Aces among the team
Another ace of hearts
Hearts to make yourself free
Yes you will
Make free of the cities
Where time stands still

You break the ace of hearts
But break too much
The bombs that cannot be defused
By your touch
Break the ace of hearts
Break aces of hearts
Break all aces of hearts...

Break the ace of hearts
Break aces of hearts
Break all aces of hearts
