Skyscrapers, earthmovers, ground breakers
Our buildings rival the heavens
Our bridges span the seas

Ingenuity is so cunning
Innovation is not ours, creativity is a luxury
We build with our hands what we have in our hearts
Fight the avalanche
You'll be buried every time
We run and run and run
Keep falling behind
Fight the avalanche
You'll be buried every time
We run and run and run
Always last in line

Before lines were lines
Before time was time
The author wrote a story in he sky, and earth below
Little do we know, we have only what we're given
Light up the sky
We're going where no man has ever gone
Little do we know, we have only what we're given
Light up the sky
We're going where no man's forgotten
All you are is all we want
It burns inside us all
We're finding heart in giving soul
We're walking home into thin air singing

We are justice fighters with faces of fire
Many walk away, but we stand firm
We are justice fighters with faces of fire
Our decisions affect our descendants

We are justice fighters with faces of fire

Skyscrapers, earthmovers, ground breakers
Our footsteps bringing purpose
Changing history
Skyscrapers, earthmovers, ground breakers
Our footsteps bringing purpose
Changing history
