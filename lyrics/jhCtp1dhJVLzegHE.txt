Now that we're done with introductions
You know a little more about me
You're convinced that I've been honest
But I never touched on my dreams of drowning
Addiction and self-loathing
Obsessive compulsive routine of burning
The memories of all my failings so I don't flinch at my reflections
Everyone's got something they wish that they could change
And I spent my life trying to be
More like you, less like me
More like you, less like me
More like you, less like me

I never asked to be born in this skin draped over me
Am I as ugly on the outside as what's living underneath?
How can you tell me that I'm special when I'm just another man?
Is this everything I'll know?
Is this everything I am?
More like you, less like me
More like you, less like me
More like you, less like me
More like you, less like me
More like you, less like me
The only thing that I'm afraid of is I will live forever
The only thing that I'm afraid of is I will live forever
Everyone's got something they wish that they could change
And I spent my life trying to be
More like you, less like me
More like you, less like me
More like you, less like me
More like you, less like me
More like you, less like me
More like you, less like me
More like you, less like me
More like you, less like me
More like you, less like me
More like you, less like me
This life's too long for me and I can't take it
Wanna be somebody else then I can make it
This life's too long for me and I can't take it
Wanna be somebody else then I can make it
Wanna be somebody else then I can make it
