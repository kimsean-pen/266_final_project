Who cares for the life we've earned?
Someone's sold all the truth you yearned
Remember when you used to shine
And had no fear or sense of time
It creeps up on you

You can't cry now there's nothing to feel
No one's noticed our loneliness
Remember when you used to tease
And made us scream in eternal joy

I believed that you'll always be here
Cause once you promised a life with no fear
Please don't break my ideals
And say what's fake was always real
I was the one, now I'm gone
Take me back again
