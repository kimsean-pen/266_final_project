P-P-P-P-Push me in that corner you've been sitting in, yah
These days, I'm so numb that I can't feel a thing, uh, yah

I came to my senses and realized that I work better alone, yah
Niggas be switching on me, just like how I be switching my phones, yah
Plotting and planning,
I don't get distracted, I stick to my goals, yah
I don't need nobody's help, I'm fine on my own

I can't trust a motherfucking soul anymore, aye
I can't trust a motherfucking soul anymore, aye
I can't trust a motherfucking soul anymore, aye
I can't trust a motherfucking soul anymore, aye

You're pushing me, you're pushing me 'til I lose control
Just let me be, just let me be, here on my own
