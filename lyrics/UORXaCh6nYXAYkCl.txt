I'm gonna tell you what you need to hear
And I'm a little too late by three or four years
And it may not make much sense now that we are apart
But I'm going to stop pretending that I didn't break your heart

You see I never thought enough of myself
To realize that losing me could mean something like the tears in your eyes
And I want to tell you I'm sorry and it's too late to start
But I'm going to stop pretending that I didn't break your heart

And it's Christmas eve, years down the line
Sitting here, wishing I'd treated you better when you were mine
And I have no way of knowing where you are
But I'm going to stop pretending that I didn't break your heart

I didn't mean to hurt you
I didn't know what I was doing
But I know what I have done
