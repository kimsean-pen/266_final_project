It's only doubts that we're counting on fingers broken long ago
I read that with every broken heart we should become more adventurous
if you banish me from your prophets and if I get banished from the kingdom up above
I'd sacrifice money and heaven all for love
Let me be loved, let me be loved

And if my brain quits well I guess then that's just it
And if my hands stop working you can call me lazy
And if I get pregnant I guess I'll just have the baby
Let it be loved, let me be loved

I've been trying to nod my head but it's like I've got a broken neck
Wanting to say I will as my last testament
For me to be saved and you to be brave we don't have to walk down that aisle
Cause if marriage ain't enough
Well, at least we'll be loved.

I've felt the wind on my cheek coming down from the east
And thought about how we are all as numerous as leaves on trees
And maybe ours is the cause of all mankind
Get loved, make more, try to stay alive

I've been trying to nod my head but it's like I've got a broken neck
Wanting to say I will as my last testament
For you to be saved and me to be brave we don't have to walk down that aisle
Cause if marriage ain't enough
Well at least we'll be loved
