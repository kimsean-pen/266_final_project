Left you, falling on the floor
Headed for the door, went straight to Philadelphia
Oh no, what have I begun?
Called my mother, said I love her, had another and another one

Questions, questions, suddenly suggestions
Where was anyone at the start of this thing?
Hold that gold up over your shoulder
All I need's a place to grieve

Oh, it's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance

Oh Lord, I feel alive!
I've gone and saved my soul!
If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go!

But now I'm over my head
Acting like I never started over again
I am the city I'm from
Always wanting more than just a word on my arm

Oh, I know, I can't believe that I'd let it get to me
Good to know, I won't become everything I'm afraid of

Oh, it's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance

Oh Lord, I feel alive!
I've gone and saved my soul!
If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go!

Mama, don't cry
I was once your little baby boy so full of love and light
By the time I turned 25
I was lost among the pavement, lower than the basement

And I couldn't stand to smile, I thought of taking my own life
But mama, don't cry
I found songs among the tragic, hung my hat on sadness

Mom, I think they're trying to keep the grand romantic in me
Now that we got bottom lines
But mom, I think I'm ready to free this grand romantic in me
La di da, la di da, la di da

Look out, look out!

Oh Lord, I feel alive!
I've gone and saved my soul!
If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go!

Oh Lord, I feel alive!
It's right here in my soul!
So if all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go!
