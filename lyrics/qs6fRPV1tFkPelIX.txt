Double B, fresh

Party

Party

That's my, that's my party

All right, Just me

And you, Party

All right, Just me

And you, Party

A! I know what you want from me
오늘 밤은 다 같이 We party
Call your friends, bring them in
And you know that
걱정 No 끝까지

But 난 오늘 주인공이 되니까
해 뜰 때까지 Turn up
우리는 달릴 거니까

내 친구 말고 필요 없어
So back in your way
오늘은 내 사람들만
We don't need enemies

Party

All right, Just me

And you, Party

All right, Just me

And you, Party

Party

오늘 밤 모두가
Everything 싹 잊어야지
Living on top
시작 때부터 나 여기였지
이 세상 내건 데 너의 자리 없지
I came from nothing
Now I got everything

You better show some respect
If you don't you
Better leave then
You're never ever gonna make it
신경 끄고 난 Do my thing
오늘 밤은 I just wanna have fun

That's my party
Party
Get it
That's my party

All right, Just me

And you, Party

All right, Just me

And you, Party
