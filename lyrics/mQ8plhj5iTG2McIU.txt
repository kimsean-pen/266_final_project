We are subject to an end
The human condition
Make a symbol of yourself, now

When will our wisdom corrode?
Decline and die
Wiped from the canvas
Remap, rewire
Memories on file

Reanimate!

Reading dream - weeding out the secrets
Seeking strength - something stronger than faith
Reading dreams - reaching deep into our cortex
We welcome the incorporation of steel

We're ever changing - increasing networks
Millions of miles - interlaced like trees
Come on the voyage - what's stored in the forest
Explore the connectome, discover yourself
Discover yourself

When will our wisdom corrode?
Decline and die
Wiped from the canvas
Remap, rewire
Memories on file

Man is forever advancing
Creating his own gods
The layers are stacking
The limits are long gone
We'll see the future intact or torn
Wealthy preserving the wrong resource
Between love and hate
The layers are stacking
