My car's a rental
Not presidential
I got no diamonds on the doors of my house
Above my level
You're something special
And I know I gotta get you somehow

No sterling silver
No greenback fountains glittering down
I'm waiting on my day to come
No champagne dinners
Cause I can't pay the bill
When we're out

I got nothing in my pockets
Tell me baby do you judge me
I got money problems
I got money problems
I been thinking way to often
Maybe only gold is flawless
I got money problems
I got money problems

Hey
Whether you started from the bottom
Or you're coming from the top of the chain
You're either looking for a way to get it
Or a way to cover your safe
But don't sweat it
When they take their percentage
Cause what goes baby comes around

No sterling silver
No greenback fountains glittering down
I'm waiting on my day to come
No champagne dinners
Cause I can't pay the bill
When we're out

I got nothing in my pockets
Tell me baby do you judge me
I got money problems
I got money problems
I been thinking way to often
Maybe only gold is flawless
I got money problems
I got money problems

Benjamin's in Vegas
Falling from the sky
Where you been your face it's
Always on my mind
I can't pretend
I dream of when I get some ends
And all my friends are screaming
Money, money, money
(Money, money, money)

No sterling silver
No greenback fountains glittering down
I'm waiting on my day to come
No champagne dinners
Cause I can't pay the bill
When we're out

I got nothing in my pockets
Tell me baby do you judge me
I got money problems
I got money problems
I been thinking way to often
Maybe only gold is flawless
I got money problems
I got money problems

I got nothing in my pockets
Tell me baby do you judge me
I got money problems
I got money problems
I been thinking way to often
Maybe only gold is flawless
I got money problems
I got money problems
