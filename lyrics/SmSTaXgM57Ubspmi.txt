Sacriledge and blasphemy
Sets the stage today
The more insatiable the sex
The more swelled our tongues became

As prehistoric as it seems, this is now, today
As prehistoric as it seems, this is now

Talkin' 'bout no vision
Talkin' 'bout no dream
The Harlot puddles for her lies
From where she speaks

I look above and see entrails in the sky
This one ain't over 'til the fat lady dies

One man rules the world
And rides the seven-headed beast
Ten diadems, to crown them all
The world, religion at his feet

Dreams are told of dreams of old
This day will surely come
So, run my child and hide your face
Once you've been marked it's finished, done

You'll become one
You're mine
You're one

I saw a new earth today
I saw a former pass away
I saw a new earth today
I saw a former pass away

Vengeance is mine
Vengeance is mine

The Netherworld and Sheol are never satisfied
So the eyes of Man are never satisfied

I saw a new Earth today
I saw a former pass away
