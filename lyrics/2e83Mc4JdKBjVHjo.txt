What is for?
What is sacred?
In my circle of regrets
Circle of regrets

Today I'm drawing circles
In my memory, in the pages of my life

That's me for a long time
I can't run away...(long time)

These stone tears are falling down on me, all my regrets
My regrets (I don't want this feeling)

I need more
All I want is to break
My circle of regrets
Circle of regrets

Is there any solution?
I want to find the way to escape... to go away
That's me for a long time
I can't run away long time

These stone tears are falling down on me, all my regrets
(My regrets... I don't want this feeling)
These stone tears are falling down on me, all my regrets
(My regrets... I don't want this feeling)
These stone tears are falling down on me, all my regrets
(My regrets... I don't want this feeling)
These stone tears are falling down on me, all my regrets
(My regrets... I don't want this feeling)

These stone tears are falling down on me, all my regrets
(My regrets... I don't want this feeling)
These stone tears are falling down on me, all my regrets
(My regrets... I don't want this feeling)
These stone tears are falling down on me, all my regrets
(My regrets... I don't want this feeling)
These stone tears are falling down on me, all my regrets
(My regrets... I don't want this feeling)
