She don't know that I'm crazy
She don't know that I'm lazy
Cause I don't know, I want you close, where no one else goes, we gotta go
I'm not crazy, I'm just saying I'm not going oh no
We've been over this lately
When I go home she hates me
Cause I don't know, I want you close, where no one else goes, we gotta go
I'm not crazy, I'm just saying I'm not going oh no
Oh I know
On my own
Oh I know
On my own
I'm not crazy, I'm just saying I'm not going oh no
