A piece of mail
A letter head
A piece of hair
On a human head

They're sayin' to me
I should've killed it
I should've killed it
I should've killed it
I should've killed it before

You're right, you're right
Kill the body and the head will die
They're laughin' at me
I should've learned it
I should've learned it
I should've learned it
I should've learned it
I should've learned it before
I should've learned it before

What a day, what a day
If you can look it in the face
And hold your vomit

What a day, what a day
If you can look it in the face
And hold your vomit

A wet sneeze and a no left turn
A row teeth and an encouraging word
Beneath a mile of skin
I should've noticed it
I should've noticed it
I should've noticed it before
noticed it before
noticed it before
noticed it before

What a day, what a day
If you can look it in the face
And hold your vomit

What a day, what a day
If you can look it in the face
And hold your vomit

What a day
What a day
What a day
What a day
What a day
What a day
What a day
Don't you touch it
Don't you touch it
What a day
What a day
No!
Don't you touch it
What a day
