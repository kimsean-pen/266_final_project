Mmm, mmm
Right now I feel like a bird
Caged without a key
Everyone comes to stare at me
With so much joy and revelry
They don't know how I feel inside
Through my smile I cry
They don't know what they're doin' to me
Keepin' me from flyin'

That's why I say that I know
Why the caged bird sings
Only joy comes from song
She's so rare and beautiful to others
Why not just set her free?
So she can fly, fly, fly
Spreadin' her wings and her song
Let her fly, fly, fly
For the whole world to see

Mmm, mmm
Hey, hey
Mmm, mmm
She's like a caged bird
Fly, fly
Ooh, just let her fly
Just let her fly, just let her fly
Spread wings, spread beauty
Hmm
