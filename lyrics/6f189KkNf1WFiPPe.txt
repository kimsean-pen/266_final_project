I can't get in
Straight on your mind!
What may be nice
Ripping all the way!

You make yourself so loud
When voice your hopes!
Your wishes got tough!

I know all evil will go
Leaving your loneliness at home
Your wishes got tough!

Denied and fired!
You're just trying to forget
To forget
Denied and fired!
You're just trying to forget
To forget

Only you know
If will be better to!
I wish you enough happiness!
Only you know
If will be better to!
I wish you enough

I can't get in
Straight on your mind!
You make yourself so loud
When voice your hopes!
Your wishes got tough!

Denied and fired!
You're just trying to forget
To forget
Denied and fired!
You're just trying to forget
To forget

Only you know
If will be better to!
I wish you enough happiness!
I wish you enough
Only you know
If will be better to!
I wish you enough happiness!
I wish you enough
I wish you enough happiness!
I wish you enough happiness!
