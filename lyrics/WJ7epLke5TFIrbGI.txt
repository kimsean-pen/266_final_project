Every moment, I need you around
Long nights in the valley
Make a good girl go down
Night drive lover, ridin' blue million miles
I'd go forever babe
Make a good girl go wild

Baby, who's your man?
Baby, who you dreaming of?
Only wanna do it like you want to do
Baby, who's your man?
Baby, who you dreaming of?
Only wanna do it like you want to do
But honey.

All we got to lose
Is just some love that'll never survive
And all we got to lose
Is just some love that'll never survive

You got me feeling like I'm lost
And now there's nothing else
You got me feeling like I'm lost
And now there's nothing else
You got me feeling like I'm lost
And now there's nothing else (in your eyes)
You got me feeling like there's no one else
You got me feeling like I'm -

I lost my head in Japan, yeah
Midnight in Tokyo
Permanent love from a one-night stand
Cross my heart, hope to die
Our love in technicolor
Beams so bright

But have I failed?
Have we grown apart?
(Baby, who's your man? Baby, who you dreaming of?)
For modern lovers
(Baby, who's your man? Baby, who you dreaming of?)
It's just the start
(Baby, who's your man? Baby, who you dreaming of?)
Of the end
(Baby, who's your man? Baby, who you dreaming of?)
There's no road ahead

You got me feeling lost
And now there's nothing else (in your eyes)
You got me feeling like I'm lost
Without your love (in your eyes)
You got me feeling like I'm lost
And now there's nothing else (in your eyes)
You got me feeling like there's no one else
You got me feeling like I'm
