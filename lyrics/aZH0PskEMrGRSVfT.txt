A crumbling altar, how dim the glow
Buried it far below
Stumble and falter within the bone
This heaven is overthrown
In every direction we're torn apart
So ineffectual

Send the fire down
The sun consumes the ground
Wash it all away
In lakes of flame

Eternal horizon, salt the earth
Sever the nearest nerve
A fading reflection to pierce the heart
Of what's amendable

Send the fire down
The sun consumes the ground
Wash it all away
In lakes of flame

Send the fire down
The sun consumes the ground
Wash it all away
In lakes of
Send the fire down
The sun consumes the ground
Wash it all away
In lakes of flame
