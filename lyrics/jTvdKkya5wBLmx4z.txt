Cut through the country, speed through the dark
A child in a train, tristessa departs
It's only the start

Filigree circles round her young wrist
Her mother is frowning at something she missed
She fixes her hair

At the failing of the day she heard her father always say
"Remember, it's only the start"

When she drifted off to sleep she had the whole world at her feet
Because it's only the start

Before they fell away it seemed to matter all the same
But it was only the start
It's only the start
