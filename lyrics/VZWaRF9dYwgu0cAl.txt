You were like an angel
When i first met you
Made me feel so good inside
You showed me what i could do
It was all so beautiful then
We were as one
But now i feel, baby
Like somethings gone

Why don't you love me like you used to do
Oh baby, baby
Why don't you love me like you used to do
OIh baby, my baby

Its been so long now
Between you and me
I thought i wanted to be part of you
Now i want to be free

Why don't you love me like you used to do
Oh baby, baby
Why don't you love me like i want you to
Oh baby, my baby
