I've been here alone
waiting for someone,
climbing going over,
getting on, on, on,
getting on, on, on.

I've been miles away,
gone back I can't tell you why,
I'm crying for nobody else,
getting on, on, on
getting on, on, on.

I'm a fucked up version
Cause monsters are gone
I know you won't believe it
but I'm dancing on my own
And I'm like alright, Oh my God
Yes I'm like alright, Oh my God
But I'm still here
I'm drinking like I'm sober

I've been thinking how
How to say goodbye to you
How to love myself today
Getting on, on, on
Getting on, on, on.

Now you think I'm done
but don't underestimate
I'm maybe broken but I'm satisfied
Getting on, on, on
Getting on, on, on

I'm a fucked up version
Cause monsters are gone
I know you won't believe it
but I'm dancing on my own
And I'm like alright, Oh my God
Yes, I'm like alrigh, Oh my God

The girl you used to know,
her monsters are gone.
I know you won't believe it
but I'm dancing on my own
And I'm like alright, Oh my God
Yes, I'm like alright, Oh my God.
I'm still here
I'm drinking like I'm sober
I'm drinking like I'm sober
Drinking like I'm sober
I'm drinking like I'm sober

I'm a fucked up version
Cause monsters are gone
I know you won't believe it
but I'm dancing on my own
And I'm like alright, Oh my God
Yes, I'm like alrigh, Oh my God

The girl you used to know,
her monsters are gone.
I know you won't believe it
but I'm dancing on my own
And I'm like alright, Oh my God
Yes, I'm like alright, Oh my God.
But I'm still here
I'm drinking like I'm sober.
