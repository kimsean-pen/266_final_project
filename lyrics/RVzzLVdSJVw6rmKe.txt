What's the point of fame if it's been abused?
What's a kid like me even got to lose?
Here I am on your bed again
It's too big for the room it's in.

Watch your face and laugh just a little bit,
Everybody knows that you're good at it,
But nothin' hurts like an answer phone
Drinkin' some, wakin' up alone.

Maybe if i try just a little more,
I can take myself from this dirty floor
and walk through buildings of elegance
Just like you are intelegent

But still i fall from grace with this microphone
How'd you fing yourself if you never roam?

But, Certainly, I'm indebted baby,
Certainly, certainly, yeah.

I know my place
but it don't know me

I know my place
but it don't know me

No one wants to hear that you're breakin' up,
It wasn't long ago we said 'start me up'
Now all your dreamin' will have to wait
While you discern, you'll anticipate

Play your 45 with this late at night
Open all the windows, turn out the light
Mysterious creatures will fill the room
A midnight show just put on for you.

But still i fall from grace with this microphone
How'd you find yourself if you never roam?

Certainly, I'm indebted baby,
Certainly, certainly, yeah.

I know my place
but it don't know me

I know my place
but it don't know me

Cold fame in my brain, but
It's okay cuz i know it's the best for me
