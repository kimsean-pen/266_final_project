Stripped of life alone
In the midst of something that I
Want to play with your evil inside
Wanting, letting go, of what never could be again
Lost and alone
Imprisoned now inside your mind
With the way you tried
To destroy me again
You were waiting and living for no one
With the way you tried
To completely refuse all your life
Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me

Awaken you
With a little evil inside
Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me
I've stricken you
I wanna live with the lie
Feed on your nothing and
You'll never live up to me

Awaken you, ooooh no
Can not live up to me
I've stricken you
Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me

Stripped of life alone
In the midst of something that I
Want to play with your evil inside
Wanting, letting go, of what never could be again
Lost and alone
Imprisoned now inside your mind
With the way you tried
To destroy me again
You were waiting and living for no one
With the way you tried
To completely refuse all your life
Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me

Awaken you
With a little evil inside
Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me
I've stricken you
I wanna live with the lie
Feed on your nothing and
You'll never live up to me

Ah, awaken you
Oooh no, can't live up to me
I'll stricken you
Oooh, can't live up to me

There isn't a thing that I can do
watching this whole thing just wash away
making me long

There isn't a thing that I can do
watching this whole thing just wash away
making me long
Making you strong

Awaken you
With a little evil inside
Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me
I've stricken you
I wanna live with the lie
Feed on your nothing and
You'll never live up to me
Can't live up to me
Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me
