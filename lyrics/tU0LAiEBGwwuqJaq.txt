What I said is what I meant, I'm just tongue tied
Waiting in the back of my mind, cannot say that
Daily dose of my own regret
An unset feelings that I won't forget
So I speak the truth and the empty things in bottle

With everything I have a diary but put into to a song
Everything I ever meant to say but always said it wrong
Every day I dialed your number, I just never made the call
It's like standing on the edge so I can contemplate the fall
Did you forget you said forever when I asked how long you'd stay?
And how we always make you ever would have stayed
what we call your way
stumbling in everything you say

So I'm contemplating the fall
I'm contemplating the fall

What I said is what I meant, I'm just tongue tied
not left untied

With everything I have a diary but put into to a song
With everything I have a diary but put into to a song
Did you forget you said forever when I asked how long you'd stay?
with everything you say
