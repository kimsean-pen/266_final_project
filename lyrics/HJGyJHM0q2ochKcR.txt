listen close and don't be stoned
i'll be here in the morning
cause i'm just floating
your cigarette still burns
your messed up world will thrill me
alison i'm lost
alison i said we're sinking
there's nothing here but that's okay
outside your room your sister's spinning
but she laughs and tells me she's just fine
i guess she's out there somewhere
and the sailors they strike poses
the TV covered walls answer slowly
with your talking and your pills
your messed up life still thrills me
alison i'm lost
alison i'll drink your wine
and wear your clothes when we're both high
alison i said we're sinking
but she laughs and tells me it's just fine
i guess she's out there somewhere
