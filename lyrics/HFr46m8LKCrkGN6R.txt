I had you by my side
It's been such a long time
Where you had to go?
I'm leaving with my heart

The way you want to play
The way you want to play
Ever want to know how
We could be this play

The heat in my heart
been there such a long time
Where you had to go to
you needed it so

How we feel what we had
the way we used to
Never going back
to the world we knew

I am in the days
from your love
So many ways
from your love
I am in the days
from your love

I had you by my side
It's been such a long time
Where you had to go?
I'm leaving with my heart

The way you want to play
The way you want to play
Ever want to know how
We could be this play

I am in the day
from your love
I am in the days
from your love

So many ways
from your love
I am in the day
from your love

I am in the day
from your love
