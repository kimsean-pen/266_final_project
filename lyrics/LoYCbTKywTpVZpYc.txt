Hot summer streets
And the pavements are burning
I sit around
Trying to smile but
The air is so heavy and dry
Strange voices are saying
(What did they say?)
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort
This heat has got
Right out of hand

It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
You're not the only one
It's a cruel

The city is crowded
My friends are away
And I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle
So I got to get up and go
And go

It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
You're not the only one
It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
You're not the only one
It's a cruel

Now don't you leave me, mmm
Now don't you leave me
Now don't you leave me
Come on, come on
Now don't you leave me, mmm
Now don't you leave me
Now don't you leave me
Come on, come on

It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer (Cruel summer)
Leaving me here on my own (Leaving me here all alone)
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel),
cruel summer (Leave me here in this summer)
You're not the only one (You're not the only one)
It's a cruel, (cruel),
cruel summer (Cruel summer) (You're not the only one)
Leaving me here on my own (Ooh-ooh)
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel), cruel summer (Cruel summer) (Ooh-ooh)
Now you're gone
You're not the only one (It's a cruel summer)
It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer (Cruel summer)
(It's a cruel summer)
It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer (Cruel summer)
(It's a cruel summer)
