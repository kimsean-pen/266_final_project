In this house where I grew up
With cozy chairs and broken cups
Memories piled up to the ceiling
Can they tell what I am feeling
I know this house outside and in
But three birds fly upon my skin
Lay my head down in the darkness
Like so many nights before this

In this bed where I rest
I'm homeless
This house I know best
But I'm homeless
My hunger it grows
And it won't let me go
And it burns in my chest
I'm homeless

Heavy steps on hardwood floors
Into my room through broken doors
Try to leave this day behind me
But peace will never find me

In this bed where I rest
I'm homeless
This house I know best
But I'm homeless
My hunger it grows
And it won't let me go
And it burns in my chest
I'm homeless

I have a place I can call my own
That's where I go til the night is gone
I travel my mind and into my heart
Nobody knows when I go that far

In this bed where I rest
I'm homeless
This house I know best
But I'm homeless
My hunger it grows
And it won't let me go
And it burns in my chest
I'm homeless
