One, two, three, forever
I will not sleep, never
Five, six, seven, hate, lover!
I will wait forever...

Forever
You and the void

Close to freedom now
Douse me with sound

You are what's constant
Everflowing
You are the water to my fire

And I will not sleep until you hold me For I cannot dream anymore
Of you and your absence so haunting
I won't sleep, I won't dream anymore

One, two, three, forsaken
Insanity awakens
Five, six, seven, fate shaken
Sanity forsaken

Close to freedom now
Douse me with sound

You are what's constant
Everflowing
You are the water to my fire

And I will not sleep until you hold me For I cannot dream anymore
Of you and your absence so haunting
I won't sleep, I won't dream anymore

You are the water to my fire
You are the answer in search of the void

Void
Let your kingdom call my name
Death
Can you see me searching for you?

And I will not sleep until you hold me For I cannot dream anymore
Of you and your absence so haunting
I won't sleep, I won't dream anymore
