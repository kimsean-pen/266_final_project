I hear that tune and it takes me back
To when everything was in it's place exact
And we were smiling to be free
And you were smiling back at me
You should always remember, not try to forget
No matter how much they tell you
Don't live and expect
It must be something I don't see
It must be something I'm missing
Ain't no medicine for the weak
Gonna have to be strong on your...
Sing song, dear!
And no it won't be long 'till you're with me
Yeah I know you're getting near
By the beauty on the breeze
On a ship with no anchor and no direction to go,
Yet we all have a room, we're staying afloat
Could it be like this in my sleep
The future's hard to receive
Ain't no medicine for the weak
Gonna have to be strong on your...
Sing song, dear!
And no it won't be long 'till you're with me
Yeah I know you're getting near
By the beauty on the breeze
Oh, oh, oooooh uuuh... Ain't no medicine for the weak
Uhhhh
Gonna have to be strong on your...
Sing song, dear!
And no it won't be long 'till you're with me
Yeah I know you're getting near
By the beauty on the breeze
