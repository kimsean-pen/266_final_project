In your eyes I could be anyone
But I'm no one
I left you without saying goodbye
You won't remember what we've said and done
And the storm won't come
I will put apart so push me aside

We can't always grow
From the seeds we sow
But stilll you watch them from your window
There's no wounds to heal
No pain to kill
Don't you break
Don't break your heart on me

You would've asked why I was leaving
When I stopped believing
In the morning rain my courage had run dry
But I'm not weaving in the shadow
Where the devil goes
He knows me well but you'll be alright

We can't always grow
From the seeds we sow
But still you watch them from your window
There's no wounds to heal
No pain to kill
Don't you break
Don't break your heart on me

Don't break your heart on me

We can't always grow
From the seeds we sow
But still you watch them from your window
There's no wounds to heal
No pain to kill
Don't you break
Don't break your heart on me

Don't break your heart on me
