Auction off what you love
It will come back sometime
Lock it up, what you love
And it says "let me be mine"

Oh, auction off what you love
It will come back sometime
Lock it up, what you love
And it says "let me be mine"

Let me be mine

You're gonna take another chunk of me with you when you go
Go ahead and take another chunk of me, yeah just go
Mmhmm, just go

Sharp extensions, set to stun
Bathing beauties lie down where I run
Like some heavy notion that's gone untouched
Meanwhile I'm still thinking about it
Mmm, I'm still thinking about it

You're gonna take another chunk of me with you when you go
Go ahead and take another chunk of me, yeah just go
Yeah, just go

Auction off what you love
It will come back sometime
How they want you to run, you to run
Too bad they want you to run
How they want you to run, you to run
Just how they want you to

Auction off what you love
It will come back sometime
Lock it up, what you love
And it says "let me be mine"
Let me be mine

How they want you to run
You to run
Oh, they want you to run
