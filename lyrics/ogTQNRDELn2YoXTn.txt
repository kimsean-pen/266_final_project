Yeah so far it's alright
Alright, baby
Yeah so far it's alright
Alright, baby
Yeah so far it's alright
Alright, baby
Yeah so far it's alright
Alright

Yeah it's the way we are
We were smoking by 11
And knocking round town
Bleeding bumps on my arm
We were never good at selling
Couldn't cut down
And I stay with my father
While his friends die of heart attacks
He's got a heart made of stone

But he never gets cold because

The sun's always on his back
"I used to think you were cool
I believed you had a wonderful vision
But I soon found out you were telling your friend
That your mother's on the television"
Gives a go on your bike

How you getting along with your life?
It's alright

Yeah it's alright

Yeah so far it's alright
Alright, baby
Yeah so far it's alright

Alright, baby
Yeah so far it's alright

Alright, baby
Yeah so far it's alright
Alright, baby

"Oh well I'm coming to the end of 23"
She said
"Is that alright?"
"And it's coming to the end of you and me"
She said
"Is that alright?"
And how can you complain about life
And talk about being bored
If you just sit at Pete's house
Playing video games
Doing sniff that you can't afford?

I can't be picking up in the town
So get me one off Adam if he's sorting you out
I don't really care what all your friends are about
I was always looking for a way to get out

It's just a reflection on the size of your house
A silver spoon and a zoot in your mouth
But you're alright

Yeah, it's alright

Yeah so far it's alright
Alright, baby
Yeah so far it's alright

Alright, baby
Yeah so far it's alright
Alright, baby
Yeah so far it's alright
Alright

So here we are
It's quarter to 11
We're knocking round town
I'm pushing in, in the bar
You can cry until 11
It's a quarter of an hour
And why stay
If you hate it so much?
You think you're well cool
You just write about sex and

Killing yourself
And how you hardly ever went to school
And don't you want to take me up in the clouds?
Pretend that I'm the one
And you can show me about?
She was talking marriage

So we had to get out
Now he's making up for it by sleeping about
The ultimatum's a ridiculous joke
I'm gonna pick the option that allows me to smoke
But I'm alright
Yeah it's alright

Yeah so far it's alright
Alright, baby
Yeah so far it's alright
Alright, baby
Yeah so far it's alright
Alright, baby
Yeah so far it's alright
Alright, baby
