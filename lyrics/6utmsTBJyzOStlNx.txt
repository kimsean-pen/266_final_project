We can't keep anything
Words lose our minds
The sky is getting crowded
But it's a different kind.

Where is my shelter from this storm
Nothing in nature can make my body warm.
There is no shelter from this kind of cold
Give me your body and anything it holds.

Let's get alone again, so far away
Let me show all my friends
And won't even kiss me for a day!
We can't keep anything
. our minds,
The sky is getting clouded
But the clouds are different this time...

Where is my shelter from this storm
Nothing in nature can make my body warm.
There is no shelter from this kind of cold
Give me your body and anything it holds.

Must be a long day so far away
...love my friends,
