Are we a fantasy?
Swimming in theocracy
We are far from holy
The wholeness of one, repeat after me

We lost the key of sight
Now blind, we fear in flight
We are far from love
But silence is golden, please observe

Fighting your empire
Defending your vampires
Far away
We're going too far

Bombing your ignorance
We're feeding your insolence
Far away
We're going too far

We're going too far

If today I die, I cannot deny
The life that I Iive
For what I say not befit myself in time
No time, to die or kill (live)

No structures of a pyramid
No train, horses to arise
Surmise my position, my words define
Fighting your empire

Defending your vampires
Far away
We're going too far
Bombing your ignorance

We're feeding your insolence
Far away
We're going too far
We're going too far

We go forward

We go backward
Living, dying
We're dying, we're living
We're living, we're dying

We're crying, we're seeing
We're living, we're breathing
Dying, seeing
Fighting your empires
Defending your vampires
Far away
We're going too far
Bombing your ignorance
We're feeding your insolence
Far away
We're going too far
We're going too far.
