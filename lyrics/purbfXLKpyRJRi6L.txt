Do not waste this evening
Baby I'm begging you
Your big imagination's playing its tricks on you
If you think my up and leave is something I'm gonna do
Feel my chest when I look at you
Baby you

You got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only
Only heart

So hard to be so far out
Lliving our separate lives
You phone was really broken
I tried your number twice
If you need confirmation, baby I understand
It's alright if you want me to
Tell you, you

You got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only
Only heart

And you love like your hand's on the horn, baby
I adore you but there's a hole in the cup that should hold your love
(Hold my love)
If you let, if you let, if you let me leave
I swear I never will

Oh, remember now you
You've got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
