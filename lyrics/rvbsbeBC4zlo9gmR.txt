A crack forms in the foundation
Well fault line through your defenses
Illuminating the essence
Once clouded by the myth

Store bought conformity
Force-fed duality
I warp reality

The comfort that you will find
As you remain hidden
The light betrays
Casting your true self away
You'll remain blind

As vanity possesses me
I am floating further away
Gripped by the belief in empty words
Driven by the need to prove

Store bought conformity
Force-fed duality
I warp reality

The comfort that you will find
As you remain hidden
The light betrays
Casting your true self away
You'll remain blind

The shell may wither
But the fire burns eternal
The shell may wither
But the fire burns wild

You hide behind, cower
The light that blinds, blinds

The comfort that you will find
As you remain hidden
The light betrays
Casting your true self away
You'll remain blind

We'll never find what burns inside
You'll remain blind behind the light
