I feel so helpless now, my guitar is not around
And I'm struggling with the xylophone to make these feelings sound
And I'm remembering you singing and bringing you to life
And it's raining out the window and today it looks like night

You haven't written to me in a week, I'm wondering why that is
Are you too nervous to be lovers-- friendships ruined with just one kiss
I watched you very closely and I saw you look away
Your eyes are either gray or blue, I'm never close enough to say

But your sweatshirt says it all with the hood over your face
And I can't keep staring at your mouth without wondering how it tastes
And I'm with another boy, he's asleep, I'm wide awake
And he tried to win my heart, but it's taken... time

And I know the shape of your hands because I watch 'em when you talk
And I know the shape of your body 'cause I watch it when you walk
And I want to know it all but I'm giving you the lead...
So go on, go on and take it, don't fake it, shake it

Crazy eyes have you
Are they gray or blue
I won't make the move
You must make the move
If you make the move
I will then approve
If you do not move
We will surely lose

Don't second guess your feelings, you were right from the start
And I notice she's your lover, but she's nowhere near your heart
This city is for strangers, like the sky is for the stars
I think it's very dangerous if we do not take what's ours

I'm winning you with words because I have no other way
I'd love to look into your face without your eyes turning away
Last night I watched you sing because a person has to try
I walked home in the rain because a person cannot lie
