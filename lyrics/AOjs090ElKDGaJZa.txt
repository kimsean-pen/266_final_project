War games inside your brain
You gotta find alone
Falling back

Your sanity has gone
Why do you everything that you can?

Run away from pain
Sorry, man
Your tries were all in vain
Wondering 'round

Like a phantom in the dark
And you're waiting for the night to come
Lunacy attacks
And you strumble to hit back

You'll be waiting for the morning sun
I'm the voice commanding you
Divided we're nothing
United we're breaking the rules

I'm the voice commanding you
Someday the madness will lose control
Over you
Dream it all

You can fly in a never-ending story
Where the sun will shine
Every passing day
Free your mind
Let your spirit go free to fly high

Let the menace be gone
Fly away
Coming in it all
The confusions in your mind

Going crazy as the night moves on
Playing with your head
Now you're wishing to be dead
And you're praying for the dawn to come
I'm the voice commanding you

Divided we're nothing

United we're breaking the rules
I'm the voice commanding you
Don't let the madness assume control
Over you
Over you
Over you
I'm the voice commanding you
(Laying down the law)
Divided we're nothing
United we're breaking the rules
Were breaking the rules
I'm the voice commanding you
Can make me go away
Over you
I will never surrender!
I'm commanding you
Laying down the law
Over you
For the light
And you can't hide
The voice commanding you
