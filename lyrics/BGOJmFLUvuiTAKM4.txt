Now listen, I think you and me
Have come to the end of our time
What d'ya want, some kind of reaction?
Well okay, that's fine
Alright how would it make you feel
If I said you never made me come?
In the year and a half that we spent together
Yeah, I never really had much fun
All those times that I said I was sober
Well I'm afraid I lied
I'd be lying next to you and you next to me
All the while I was high as a kite
I could see it in your face as you break it to me gently
Well you really must think you're great
Well let's see how you feel in a couple of weeks
When I work my way through your mates
I never wanted it to end up this way
You've only got yourself to blame
I'm gonna tell the world you're rubbish in bed now
And that you're small in the game
I saw you thought this was gonna be easy
Well you're out of luck
Yeah, let's rewind, let's turn back time
To when you couldn't get it up
You know what? I shoulda ended it there
That's when I shoulda shown you the door
As if that weren't enough to deal with
You became premature
I'm sorry if you feel that I'm being kinda mental
But you left me in such a state
Now I'm gonna do what you did to me
Gonna reciprocate
I never wanted it to end up this way
You've only got yourself to blame
I'm gonna tell the world you're rubbish in bed now
And that you're small in the game
You're not big, you're not clever
No, you ain't ya big brother, not big whatsoever
You're not big, you're not clever
No, you're not ya big brother, not big whatsoever
I'm sorry if you feel that I'm being kinda mental
But you left me in such a state
But now I'm gonna do what you did to me
Gonna reciprocate
I never wanted it to end up this way
You've only got yourself to blame
I'm gonna tell the world you're rubbish in bed now
And that you're small in the game
You're not big, you're not clever
No, you ain't ya big brother, not big whatsoever
You're not big, you're not clever
Not big whatsoever, no you ain't ya big brother
You're not big, you're not clever
Not big whatsoever, no you ain't ya big brother
You're not big, you're not clever
Not big whatsoever, no you ain't ya big brother
