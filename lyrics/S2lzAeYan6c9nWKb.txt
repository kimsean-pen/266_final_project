Another secret for ya
I've been told if you want to make it in this game
You got to have the luck
You got to have the look

To make what I quite like to make it through the night
My heart beats slow fast, I dont feel right
With a sleight of hand I might die
What about you over there?
Don't you think I care?
Well I know you know I know you know I know
And to the man who would be king
I would say only one thing
And to the man who would be king
I will say only one thing
la la la-la-la-laa la la la-la-la-laa

I lived my dreams today
And I have lived it yesterday

And I'll have lived it tomorrow
No don't look at me that way
Well I heed the words you say...
But my heart has gone astray
I watched friendship slip away
But it wasn't s'posed to be that way
I lived my dreams today I lived it yesterday
And I'll be living yours tomorrow
Anything else to say?
I lived my dream today I lived it yesterday
And I'll be living yours tomorrow
So don't look at me that way!
What's about you man, Nancy my dear
What's about you man, Nancy my dear
What's about you man, Nancy my dear

What will you do when she comes here?
Oh she'll kill me
Oh, I don't wanna kill me
And to the man who would be king
I would say only one thing
And to the man who would be king
I would say only one thing
la la la-la-la-laa la la la-la-la-laa
Perish the day when they heed what you say
They'll take you away if they don't like what you say
They don't like what you say

So come what may but I'll never stay

I'll never stay
