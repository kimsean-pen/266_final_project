I got a brand-new baby and I feel so good
She loves me even better than I thought she would
I'm on my way to her house and I'm plumb out of breath
When I see her tonight, I'm gonna squeeze her to death

Claudette, pretty little pet
Claudette, never make me fret, Claudette
She's the sweetest little girl that I've ever met
Got the best love that I'll ever get from Claudette
Pretty little pet Claudette

Well I'm a lucky man
My baby treats me right
She's gonna let me hug and kiss and hold her tight
When the date is over and we're at her front door
When she kiss me goodnight I'll holler "More, more, more!"

Claudette, pretty little pet, Claudette
Never make me fret, Claudette
She's the greatest little...
Greatest little girl that I've ever met
Got the best love that I'll ever get from Claudette
Oh, oh, Claudette
Yeah, yeah, Claudette

When me and my new baby have a date or three
I'm gonna ask my baby if she'll marry me
I'm gonna be so happy for the rest of my life
When my brand-new baby is my brand-new wife

Claudette, pretty little pet, Claudette
Never make me fret, Claudette
She's the greatest little girl that I've ever met
Get the best loving
That I'll ever get from Claudette

Oh, oh, Claudette
Yeah, yeah, Claudette
