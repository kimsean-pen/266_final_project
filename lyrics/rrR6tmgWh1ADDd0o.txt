This is nothing new, but now you know
The promise of what you believed to be
Has been stricken long before
The faceless are gone, we all fit their mold
The careless, impulsive rats of this world
The careless, impulsive rats of this world
Strike fear, concede, control
We are all guilty, strike fear
We are all guilty, concede
We are all guilty, control
They'll put it together
We are all guilty
We are all guilty
We are all guilty
They'll put it together
All faces down
We pledge allegiance to
All faces down
Halves stand divided fall
All faces down
A scored distraction to
All faces down
The tyranny has come
Now we are all their game
Fear strikes the rights of fools
Halves stand divided fall
A scored distraction to enslave
The storms come
The watchers rule
They aim to save the world
The watchers rule
Now we are all their game
Fear strikes the rights of fools
Halves stand divided fall
A scored distraction to enslave
The storms come
The watchers rule
They aim to save the world
The watchers rule
They aim to save the world
The watchers rule
A scored distraction to enslave
Strike fear, concede, control
Halves stand divided fall
The storms come
The watchers rule
