I felt you wear me thin
Remind me of a heart that once caved in
And a pulse that felt so distant
I begged you for silence than
Digging deeper at the thorns under my skin
From a head that wouldn't listen

I don't feel anything
My mind tells me I can't get out of this
I won't fall for it
Never show them what weakness is
I don't feel anything
My mind tells me I can't get out of this
I won't fall for it
I feel my bones as they're tightening

I thought you'd set me free
You faded when I pleaded leave me be
Left my vision toe to toe with broken soul remission
Oh have I been deceived
A giant lying silent inside me
I need to face the truth
It's hard to hide what's inside of you

I don't feel anything
My mind tells me I can't get out of this
I won't fall for it
Never show them what weakness is
I don't feel anything
My mind tells me I can't get out of this
I won't fall for it
I feel my bones as they're tightening

I'm just a shell
Holding in these shattered nerves
A skeleton that's lost its skin
And I want back in

I don't feel anything
My mind tells me I can't get out of this
I won't fall for it
Never show them what weakness is
I don't feel anything
My mind tells me I can't get out of this
I won't fall for it
Feel my bones as they're tightening
