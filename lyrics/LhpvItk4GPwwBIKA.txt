I'm a raw nerve in the sunlight
After two weeks in the dark
If you've gotta tell me you're not using
It's probably 'cause you are

I saw you there
Just a block off the sea, you're a rowhome
On an empty street where the others have been torn down
And you're the last one standing

It must get lonely
It must get lonely

When the grace starts to swallow grey
Where the sky meets the Irish sea
Like a suit that's been to too many funerals
And starts fraying at the seams
I saw a bag of clementines split right open on an English street
And the contrast made me feel so goddamn dizzy

I saw you there
A block off the sea, you're a rowhome
On an empty street
The others have been torn down
You're the last one standing

It must get obvious enough that I'm not ever gonna change
It must get obvious enough
I'm the one who stays

But it must get lonely
It must get lonely
But it must get lonely
But it must get lonely

I'm a specter in the dim light on the flowers by the grave
In the Montmartre in Paris
Where the crows seem to know my name
And they left footprints in the snow
Along the fence on Palmer Street
Cigarette butts on the headstones
That you left for me

I saw you there
Just a block off the sea, you're a rowhome
On an empty street where the others have been torn down
And you're the last one standing

It must get obvious enough that I'm not ever gonna change
It must get obvious enough that I'm the one who stays
It must get obvious enough that I'm not ever gonna change
It must get obvious enough, that you're the one who stays

But it must get lonely
It must get lonely
(it must get lonely)
It must get lonely
(it must get lonely)
It must get lonely
(it must get lonely)
It must get lonely
It must get lonely
