There is only so far these cold tales will reach
And I can go it alone but my shoulders are growing so weak
And you walk in the steps of the men that you grew up with
But maybe they're better equipped at dealing with this

And I'm starting to realize
I'm out on my own
I'm starting to realize
I'm out on my own

Yeah, I am a man, I'm a man of my word
I don't talk in tongues, I don't close my lungs when I curse
Talk to me, talk to me, I am alone in here
And walk in the steps of the men that you grew up with
But maybe they're better equipped at dealing with this

And I'm starting to realize
I'm out on my own
I'm starting to realize
I'm out on my own

And I'm starting to realize
I'm out on my own
And I'm starting to realize
I'm out on my own
And I'm starting to realize
I'm out on my own
