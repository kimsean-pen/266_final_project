She's taking it down in cap size increments
She'll have one more, take her medicine
She hopes for some more and soon she will pray
Today's tomorrow, tomorrow's today

She ties, ties, ties her self in knots
She's down at the bar taking some shots
One leads to four and four leads to five
She's numbing herself till I'm not alive

I pamper myself with a couple more
The streetcars sound like the waves on the shore
The traffic tide pulls me slowly away
Today's tomorrow, tomorrow's today

I won't be coming down, I'm busy mending my broken heart
I lie, I lie, I lie, you don't need to start
I dumb myself down, thinking it's smart
Maybe we're better off alone and apart

I was wrong
You were wrong
In each others eyes
I was right
You were right
in our own eyes

I stare at the bottles with canceled eyes
The drunks, the dogs, and the children have truth in their lies
I'd hope one would come and show me the way
Today's tomorrow, tomorrow's today

I'm stumbling home gonna pay the price
I'll try not to be cold, I'm gonna make it nice
I poured my heart out with the bottle I've filled
Walking home to you is always uphill
