You were the one to visit my darkness
You were the brightest way
You dropped a stone into the well
We'd wait for the sound it made
When it got quiet, you could hear your heart
Tell me, what did it say?
I was a bird, you opened the cage
It felt like a clean white page

You came along
You light up my days, my personal sun
Showing me all the ways I could fall
You made me feel new
I'm crashing, I'm crashing right into you
Baby, feel me crash
I'm crashing, I'm crashing right into you
Baby, feel me crash

You came along
You light up my days, my personal sun
Showing me all the ways I could fall
You made me feel new
I'm crashing, I'm crashing right into you
Baby, feel me crash
I'm crashing, I'm crashing right into you
Baby, feel me crash
