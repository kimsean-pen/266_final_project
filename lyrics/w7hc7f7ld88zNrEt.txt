Searching for the answers
I never thought I'd find
Fascination, inspiration
Corners of my mind

Feed my, feed my fire
Hold me, pure desire
Waiting, waiting for the time

We will be mine
You will be mine
You will be mine

Picking up the pieces
Of the heart you left behind
Put me back together
This new love of mine I've found
Basking in the glory
Masking out the pain
These memories in my head
Will never be the same again

Feed my, feed my fire
Hold me, pure desire
Waiting, waiting for the time
Feed my, feed my fire
Hold me, pure desire
Waiting, waiting for the time

We will be mine
You will be mine
You will be mine

I'm running just to find you
And my feet won't touch the ground
Aching for the time to change
It's coming back around
I'm running just to find you
And my feet won't touch the ground
Aching for the time to change
It's coming back around
Coming back around

Feed my, feed my fire
Hold me, pure desire
Waiting, waiting for the time
Feed my, feed my fire
Hold me, pure desire
Waiting, waiting for the time

We will be mine
You will be mine
You will be mine

Oh, I love you baby, please
Never leave me, it's true love you see
Oh, I love you baby, please
Never leave me, it's true love you see
