You will get demonized
All actions have their price
(Choose well and carefully)
We can not tolerate intractability
(As you will see)

Drown
Tonight
But I'd rather hunt you down
We'll strike
Know
Your pride
That I'll never let you go
Stands in your way

We have to bear the weight of truth
We have to deal with our own moral sense
That is how life has to be
Let's spin the wheel of destiny

You cannot prove those facts
We'll cover all out tracks
(Choose well and carefully)
If we can't obviate
That you will tempt your fate
(You'll need to bleed)

None will restrain us here
We'll drive a bargain now
(Choose well your enemy)
And justice will be done, the righteous will prevail
We will proceed

Drown
Tonight
But I'd rather hunt you down
We'll strike
Know
Your pride
That I'll never let you go
Stands in your way

We have to bear the weight of truth
(Have to bear the weight of truth)
We have to deal with our own moral sense
(With our own conscience)
That is how life has to be
(How we need this life to be)
Let's spin the wheel of destiny

As we will bathe in silence, dreaming
You can keep going on
Meanwhile the gravy train keeps rolling
We will not rock the boat

We have to bear the weight of truth
(Have to bear the weight of truth)
We have to deal with our own moral sense
(With our own conscience)
That is how life has to be
(How we need this life to be)
Let's spin the wheel of destiny

We have to seek the source of truth
(Have to mind the source of truth)
We have to face our sphere of influence
(With our own conscience)
That is what life means to be
(How we need the world to be)
Let's change the wheel of destiny
