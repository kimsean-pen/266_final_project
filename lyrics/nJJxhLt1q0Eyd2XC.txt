You speak to me through dreams
Your love transcends mortality, oh
The thread of life is barely in my grasp
For I crave to be with you more than anything

I'm longing ocean deep
There's no remedy
Chasing ghosts and dreams
Lost felicity
Somewhere ocean deep
In my memories
The wound inside won't heal
Until we join in eternal sleep

You reach to me so serene
From beyond, where you rest in peace, oh
You stay a while then fade away with a smile
But never truly disappear

I'm longing ocean deep
There's no remedy
Chasing ghosts and dreams
Lost felicity

Somewhere ocean deep
In my memories
The wound inside won't heal
Until we join in eternal sleep

Longing ocean deep
There's no remedy
Chasing ghosts and dreams
Lost felicity
Somewhere ocean deep
In my memories
The wound inside won't heal
Until we join in eternal sleep

Longing ocean deep
There's no remedy
Chasing ghosts and dreams
Lost felicity
Somewhere ocean deep
In my memories
The wound inside won't heal
Until we join in eternal sleep
