You're homeward bound for wisdom, because you've seen the webs you've spun,
You're versed in vice and virtue but this time your vice has won,
But when hopelessness would tell you that your better days are done,
Have no fear you'll overcome.

There are times where you might feel that there is nothing left to hold,
That every time you lift your chin your faults have laid you low,
But mercy's in the mightiest and mighty is the judge,
He will lift you up above.

And you'll cry.

'Now I am a heart with a head on my shoulders and I can say that I'm a different child!'
