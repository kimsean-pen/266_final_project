There was way too much water, but these rivers refused to run dry
All worlds wisdom lies buried beneath, but these rivers... ...they refused to run dry
There was way too much water, but these rivers refused to run dry
All worlds wisdom lies buried beneath, but these rivers... ...they refused to run dry

Disabled and unarmed we are adrift on this sea of life
A shoreless tide of disorder, just to perish, just to sink
We reach the bottom faster than we thin, we run out of breathe
Pass the realm of shades and reach their end, which is death...

Oh these rivers of nihil, so called rivers of no return
Swallowed and will not disgorge me for quite some time
They know their courses leading up the happy hunting grounds
They know the time of day, know, dead people won't return...

I'M HAUNTED BY WATERS
Drawn together till the end of days
My dear, it will find me, wherever I may roam...
I feel enamoured, like moths are attracted to flames
I'm the deluge, the greatest flood of all, my own nemesis...
...I AM THE FLOOD...

DRY THE RIVER...
DRY THE RIVER...
DRY... THIS RIVER...

You can stop now, leading me up the garden path
I'm awoken, I see all people behind their masks
All these pale corpses hurrying along a winding path
Hurrying down these rivers, to their end, which is death...
