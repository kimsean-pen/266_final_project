Me and Valentina went down to the chapel
But the gates were shut
I had my vows on my pocket
And a gold plated ring for my honey love

We headed down Tropicana to the corner
With a late night restaurant
We sat across from each other
When I looked her in the eyes there was something gone

Was it something that I said or did?
Was it something that I should have kept hidden?
If you leave me hanging, I don't know what I'll do

It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
In the clear of a blue moonlight
You got me on my knees, Valentina, this is not like you

I got a job in the nugger
And I'll save a thousand dollars for a brand new start
She said, "I didn't wanna do it but I did it
'Cause I didn't want to break your heart"

The way they whisper when they said
We had to take the conversation to the parking lot
Please baby, please Valentina
Baby, you're the only thing I got

Was it something that I said or did?
Was it something that I should have kept hidden?
If you leave me hanging, I don't know what I'll do

It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
In the clear of a blue moonlight
You got me on my knees, Valentina, this is not like you

I heard the church bells ringing in my head
And I'd take them everywhere I'd go
Valentina met a dealer
And I heard they had a baby five months ago
Was it something that I said or did?
Was it something that I should have kept hidden?
If you leave me hanging, I don't know what I'll do
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
In the clear of a blue moonlight
You got me on my knees, Valentina, don't say it's true
This is not like you
