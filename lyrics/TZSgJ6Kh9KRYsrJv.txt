You wanna know
Used to see it coming
Used to see it turn from within
I wanna know
A nickel for your thoughts
A dime for a touch on your skin
Never get enough
A touch from the soft and the rough
Even we know
It's not the way we do things
Not the way they do around here

Calm down my love
When we play the soft and the rough
Calm down my love
when loving you just isn't enough
I'm cornered underneath and above
For loving you just isn't enough

What do we know
Used to see it coming
Used to see it turn on its own
We go along
But don't see where to end
It's a straight line that we have bend
So, we stick to what we know
With stolen alibis we won't blow
We calm the rush
The praising or the blame
All stays the same to us

Calm down my love
