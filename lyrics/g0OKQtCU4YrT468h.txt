Dark horizon, darkest sky
No light is present
Freezing winds of lands unamiable
Haunts the wastes of Neverwhere

Life doesn't belong here

Limitless, unmeasurable - time is not
As the end so is the beginning
Always was, always will be
This is where the journey ends
This is what no one returned to tell

Neverwhere

Life doesn't belong here

Dark thoughts, darkest mind
no light is present
I now put aside my crown of thorns
Time has come to join eternity
And rest my eyes on a darker shade of color

Eager to be erased
Innumerable stare behind frozen eyes
Wanderers strayed from eternity's path
longed for to come, to rest at last

Limitless, unmeasurable - time is not
As the end so is the beginning
Always was, always will be
This is where the journey ends
This is what no one returned to tell

Dimensions warped in times of motionless storm
Now frozen worlds collide
As the womb of cold opens wide
Childhood has passed
Now birth will come of ages dreamed of by none
Now awaited, the circle to close
We wait for the call, Lazaraus come out

Now awaited, the circle to close
We wait for the call - Lazaraus come out
We wait in the shadows of Neverwhere
