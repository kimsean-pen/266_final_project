Without your makeup, I'm confused
Oh I think you look amazing, but I'm not sure I do
What is it? I'm drunk and I don't see
When it's you that I want
Don't even know what's good for me
Don't know what I've got

What kind of man am I?
Drunk on my own supply
I should get over myself
Time to get over myself

'Cause if it's cool then it's cool
Won't fuck around no more
And if it's cool then it's cool
Won't fuck around no more
I'll put my tie at your door
If this ship goes down
I'm going down with it
Ship goes down
I'm going down with it
I'm aboard

It's like a badge of honour that you know me well
Perhaps you know me better
Than I know myself
How long will thicker lies keep rolling
Rolling dice
How long will you be happy to pay the price

What kind of man am I?
Drunk on my own supply
I should get over myself
Can't I get over myself

'Cause if it's cool then it's cool
Won't fuck around no more
And if it's cool then it's cool
Won't fuck around no more
I'll put my tie at your door
If this ship goes down
I'm going down with it
Ship goes down,
I'm going down with it
I'm aboard

Stay with it, stay with it
When the ship goes down

Eyes on floor 'cause I keep seeing ghosts when there ain't none
And when I look around, see no complication
Why am I tryna to make one?
(Make one)
On script, this is where I jump ship
But I won't run

But if it's cool then it's cool
Won't fuck around no more
And if it's cool then it's cool
Won't fuck around no more

I'll put my tie at your door
If this ship goes down
I'm going down with it
Ship goes down
I'm going down with it
I'm aboard

I'll put my tie at your door
If this ship goes down
I'm going down with it
Ship goes down,
I'm going down with it
I'm aboard

And I'm here to stay
I'm here to stay
I'm aboard
Oh I'm aboard
