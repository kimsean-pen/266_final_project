Well I know I'm just an ignorant Englishman
But I'd like to make America great again
So if you'll forgive my accent and the cheek of it
Here's some suggestions from the special relationship

Let's make America great again
By making racists ashamed again
Let's make compassion in fashion again
Let's make America great again

Well I've been fortunate to go 'round the continent
From California through the midwest and Providence
And I've mostly only encountered common sense
Hospitality and warmth from Americans
But I wish it was a bit less significant
The program and the name of the President
Because it seems to me the truth is self-evident
You fought our king to be independent

Make America great again
By making racists ashamed again
Let's make compassion in fashion again
Let's make America great again

Ellis Island take me in
Everyone can start again
In the shining city on the hill
Where nobody can be illegal

Let's make America great again
By making racists ashamed again
Let's make compassion in fashion again
Let's make America great again

Let's be a friend to our oldest friends
And call them out when they're faltering
Remind them of their best selves and then
We'll make America great again
