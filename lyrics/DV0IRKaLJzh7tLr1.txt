Laying to rest
My Sunday best
Calling you up
On an empty threat

Laying to rest
My Sunday best
A Sunday best
That I never will forget

Laying to rest
My Sunday best
Calling you up
On an empty threat

Laying to rest
My Sunday best
A Sunday best
That I never will forget

She's looking up
Into the broken sun
Skin's burning all night long
Until the bone

She's cold to you
Cause you're the only one
That makes her realize
That she is all alone

Laying to rest
My Sunday best
Calling you up
On an empty threat

Laying to rest
My Sunday best
A Sunday best
That I never will forget

Broken sun...
