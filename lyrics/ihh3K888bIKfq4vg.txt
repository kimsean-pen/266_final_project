Don't even wanna fix it now
Should know better than to wait around
All in a haze
Couldn't shake it for the rest of the day
And if you shoot it down
You better get back up
You better get back up

And I'm sorry babe, that's not where I'm at
Shouldn't be here when you get back
Just to stand in line
Wait for you and then waste my time

And if you spill your guts
And try new clothes
And try new clothes

And in full control
I'm not lost
Even when it's love
Even when it's not

And hold your breath when you hold the door
I never think about it anymore
Now when I lay back
It goes to nothing and it goes to black

And if you spill your guts
I hope he's enough
I hope he's enough

And in full control
I'm not lost
Even when it's love
Even when it's not

Even when it's love
Even when it's love
Even when it's love
Even though it's not
