The magical potion of reanimation
Bittersweet cranberry flavoured euphoria
Rise from bed my darling

So I can see you again
So I can kill you again

My brains accelerate
And I'll
Reassemble you again

The witches can't be loved
So bravely I fought
They fell and failed
My Lady doesn't wilt

Lata lulila lulula lilula ta
Lata lulila lulula lulalila
Lata lulila lulula lilula ta
Lata lulila lulula lulalila

Poisoned sandwich tea party starts now

Eat up
If you're lucky you won't rot

Eat up
It's your turn
Eat till you drop

Eat up
Maybe this time you'll be caught

Eat up
Fill your stomach till it pops

Eat up
Eat it all just eat it all
Cause there's no poison after all

I've cleared mountains and dungeons
Iron maiden
My Lady has spoken
"Ga1ahad, you will shall never collapse"
So I charged up my lasers

Talila lulila
That makes your bones stronger than steel
Tulila talila
That backs up your thoughts to the cloud

Truth or false
It's the logic that dictates it all
Rising edge ticks the clock
Stimulates you flip-flop
Generate
Oscillate
Let your blood fill the gates
Multiplex
Process registration

Wipe off your pus
Grind down your vitamins
The end justifies the means
Open the book
Turn to page 617 â€” Scientific Witchery

Someday
I'll conquer the land have you slayed

Blast away
Blast away
Don't be like Lancel0t
You are the new upgrade

I appriciate your thoughts
But you've given me too much to tolerate

I've done so much for you
But you treat me this way

No forgiveness for this endless love
My goddess never looked at me

Finally our wounds closed
Our wounds closed
Turned into
Purple scabs
Kiss me tenderly gently violently

There's no undo and there's no repeat
Can't go back to how we used to be
There's no restart but only proceed
Take up from where we've left off and see
