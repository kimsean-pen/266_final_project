Elevator's on the rise
Riding me up into the sky
Lifting to you sudden
Numbers up above the door
Counting down but going up
Climbing floor to floor

I wear my highest heels
I want to feel proximity
When you're with me
All, all I wanna do
Is level off, level it off with you

Everyone can see
That you got inches on me
But when we're lying down
The difference diminishes

What goes up must go down
Looking up at the love we found
Gotta get to you somehow
I can barely reach you now

I'm on my tippy-toes
Cause eye-to-eye is challenging
Ooh, I'm balancing
(well you know how it goes)
I put my lips where they belong
A kissing marathon

Let's meet up there next time
And level out when we arrive
The size will equalize us
All, all I wanna do
Is level off, level it off with you

And my condition is clear
The height of an absurdity
But when we're lying down
The difference is minimal

What goes up must go down
Looking up at the love we found
Gotta get to you somehow
I can barely reach you now

What goes up must go down
Looking up at the love we found
Gotta get to you somehow
I can barely reach you now

Opposites attract you know
No rules, no right or wrong
Cause when the love is strong
Everybody fucks Tall John

Learn, you never learn
You never leave me in the park
Dinner after dark

Learn, you never learn
You never riding to the floor
Coming back for more
