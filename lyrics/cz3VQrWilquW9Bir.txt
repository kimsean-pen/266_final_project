Lost in a dream perpetually
I'm tired of pretending
Gently you cut me, the blade leaves a sting
The pain is unrelenting

There is nothing left beneath the skin
My heart bleeds underneath a skeleton

Your voice in the breeze carries ominously
I need you to release me
Suffering so deeply if only Ii could
Disappear completely

There is nothing left beneath the skin
My heart bleeds underneath a skeleton

This wound's too deep
If I sleep
Will you think of me
This wound's too deep
When you sleep
Will you dream of me
