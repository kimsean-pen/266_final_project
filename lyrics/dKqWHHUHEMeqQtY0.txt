you're lost in post traumatic love

warm hands caress you
under the waves
fall on the rocks
you don't want to be saved
sorry for sadness
wash all your fear
save your last breath now
the water is clear
you're lost in post traumatic love

you're lost in post traumatic love
you're lost in post traumatic love

swallowed in promise
diamonds and pearls
bury your treasures
time to be sure
under the surface
he's not what he seems
stay here with me
I don't care where you've been
you're lost in post traumatic love

you're lost in post traumatic love
you're lost in post traumatic love
you're lost in post traumatic love
you're lost in post traumatic love
