I had some brand new shoes
They were all red but they gave me the blues
And they're running away, they left me a letter

It's just like you told me it'd be
It's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing at all

We are all made of air
There's stars in my eyes and there's sun in my hair
And I'm running away, it makes me feel better

It's just like you told me it'd be
It's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing at all

When it comes down to this
I'm neither sorry nor cross nor unfit
And I'm running away, there's smoke on my sweater

It's just like you told me it'd be
It's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing at all
