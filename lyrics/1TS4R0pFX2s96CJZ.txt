Lessons learned and bridges burned to the ground
And it's too late now to put out the fire
Tables turned
And I'm the one who's burning now
Well I'm doing all right till I close my eyes
And then I see your face and it's no surprise

Just like that, I'm crawling back to you
Just like you said I would, yeah
Swallow my pride, I'm crawling back to you
Yeah, I'm out of my head, can't wait any longer
I'm down on my knees, I thought I was stronger
Just like that, like you said I'd do
Yeah, I'm crawling back to you

Time can heal, but the scars only hide the way you feel
And it's hard to forget how I left you hanging
Holding by a thread, when everything is said
I regret it
Yeah I was doin' all right, thought I could make it
Then I see your face and it's hard to fake it

Just like that I'm crawling back to you
Just like you said I would, yeah
Swallow my pride, now I'm crawling back to you
Yeah, I'm out of my head, can't wait any longer
I'm down on my knees, I thought I was stronger
Just like that like you said I'd do
Yeah, I'm crawling back to you

If you could find a way to give everything, I know you would
And I would take it all back if only I knew that I could

Lessons learned and bridges burned to the ground
And it's too late now to put out the fire

Just like that I'm crawling back to you
Just like you said I would, yeah
Swallow my pride, I'm crawling back to you
Yeah, I'm out of my head, can't wait any longer
I'm down on my knees, I thought I was stronger
Just like that like you said I'd do
Yeah, I'm crawling back to you
Yeah, I'm crawling back to you
Ohhh, yeah, yeah!
Oh!
Crawling back to you
I'm crawling back to you
