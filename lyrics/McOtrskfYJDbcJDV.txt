I don't want to wonder if this a blunder
I don't want to worry whether we're going to stay together till we die
I don't want to jump in unless this music's thumpin
All the dishes rattle in the cupboards when the elephants arrive

I want to love you madly
I want to love you now
(I want to love you)
I want to love you madly
(wait)
I want to love you love you love you madly

I don't want to fake it,
I just want to make it
The ornaments look pretty but they're pulling down the branches of the tree
I don't want to think about it,
I don't want to talk about it
When I kiss your lips I want to sink down to the bottom of the sea

I want to love you madly
I want to love you now
(yeah)
I want to love you madly
(wait)
I want to love you, love you, love you madly

I don't want to hold back,
I don't want to slip down
I don't want to think back to the one thing that I know I should have done
I don't want to doubt you,
know everything about you
I don't want to sit across the table from you wishing I could run

I want to love you madly
I want to love you now
I want to love you madly
(oh wait)
I want to love you, love you, love you madly
