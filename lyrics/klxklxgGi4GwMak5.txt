Open your eyes
Let battle begin
Fight for your life
The awakening
All you see is propaganda
All you hear is propaganda
Should I believe propaganda
Over my dead body
In the cold light
Deep passions begin
Moon bathed in fire
Retribution
A religious propaganda
Political propaganda
Force-fed propaganda
Over my dead body
Over my
Dead body
Over my
Dead body
Unholy Propaganda
Heavenly Propaganda
Blasphemy, propaganda
Over my dead body
