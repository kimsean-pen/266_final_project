Aaaa yyeeeaahhhaaa yyeeaaahhhaaa
Do you wonder
What will come
And you know
When the fire goes down
Takes us all
And moves us closer.
Where there's nothing there
Nothing closer by
Is there's nothing there
Cause the whole is inside
The world we come
The only six...
To be heard
The understanding
There's nothing left
Only a whisper guarded
Is there's nothing left
...
Moments behind
The lies
...
Is there nothing left
Of this mess we made
Is there nothing left
Of the love...
And I know
In the end it never shows
...
I want to run
Til I can't feel it
...
I wanna go
Til I never stop(5x)
