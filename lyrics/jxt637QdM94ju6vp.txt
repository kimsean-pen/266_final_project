Delusional
I believed I could cure it all for you dear
Coax or trick or drive or
Drag the demons from you
Make it right for you
Sleeping beauty, truly thought
I could magically heal you

You're far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
Failing miserably to rescue
Sleeping beauty

Drunk on ego, truly thought I could make it right if I
Kissed you one more time to help you face the nightmare, but you're
Far too poisoned for me
Such a fool to think that I could
Wake you from your slumber, that I could actually heal you

Sleeping beauty
Poisoned and hopeless

Far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
Failing miserably to find a way to comfort you
Far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
Hiding from some poisoned memory

Poisoned and hopeless
Sleeping beauty
