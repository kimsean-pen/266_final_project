Oh yeah
Well I get rattled every time we meet
I get rattled even in my sleep
I get rattled baby, over you

Yeah, I get twisted, I get turned around
I get twisted and I'm up and I'm down
I get twisted baby, over you

Well baby, baby, baby won't you save one night for me
Baby, baby, baby is there something wrong with you
Baby, baby, baby this is outta my control
It looks like nothing's wrong, but deep down in my soul

I'm twisted
Shaken
Rattled
I get rattled baby, over you

Rattled baby, over you

Oh baby, baby, baby won't you save one night for me
Baby, baby, baby is there something wrong with you
Oh baby, baby, baby this is outta my control
It looks like nothing's wrong, but deep down in my soul
I'm rattled (rattled)
Twisted (twisted)
Shaken (shaken)
I get twisted baby, over you

Whoa, I get shaken, I get torn up by the roots
Yeah, I'm shakin' way down in my boots
I get rattled baby, over you

Yeah I get rattled baby, over you

Yeah I'm rattled baby
Over you
