Aboard a craft bereft of oar, I rowed upstream to find Lenore
Abducted by a bandit or a king from some forgotten war
And mindful of his larval craze, the rhinotropic micro-gaze
Ignored it and to my amazement rode to Paris in twelve days

This is the work of the guelah papyrus
Stranded for a moment on the ocean of Osyrus
Absorbing all she can for every member of her clan
Expanding exponentially like some recursive virus

She take me on, I never fail to ride on the redundant rail
'Cause when I know she's switched a track there's always one to take me back
And through the bedroom door intrude a fretful frown and spoil the mood
'Cause though I never really stand that tall she tilt my frame, she watch me fall

chorus
*** Instrumental interlude is THE ASSE FESTIVAL ***

So maybe I could be a fly and feed arachnid as I die
And view the ritual from within the silken tunnel that they spin
And through the bedroom door intrude a fretful frown and spoil the mood
'Cause though I never really stand that tall she tilt my frame, she watch me fall

chorus 3x
