Lori Meyers used to live upstairs
Our parents had
Been friends for years
Almost every afternoon
We'd play forbidden games
At nine years old there's no such shame.

It wasn't recognition of her face,
What brought me back was a familiar mark
As it flashed across the screen.
I bought some magazines,
Some video taped scenes
Incriminating act
I felt that I could save.

Who the hell are you to tell me how to live?
You think I sell my body,
I merely sell my time
I ain't no Cinderella,
I ain't waiting for no prince
To save me in fact until just now
I was doin' just fine
And on and on

I know what degradation feels like
I felt it on the floor
At the factory where I worked long before,
I took control
Now I answer to me
The 50k I make this year
Will go anywhere I please
Where's the problem?
