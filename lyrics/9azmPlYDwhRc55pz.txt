Pull it out, turn it up, what's your favorite song?
That's mine, I've been crying to it since I was young
I know there's someone out there feelin
just like I feel I know they're waiting up
I know they're waiting to heal

And I've been holding my breath
Are you holding your breath
For too many years to count?

And we waited for the sirens
That never come
And we only write by the moon
Every word handwritten

And to ease the loss of youth
And how many years I've missed you
Pages plead forgiveness
Every word handwritten

Let it out, let me in, take a hold of my hand
There's nothing like another soul
That's been cut up the same
And did you want to drive
Without a word in between?

I can understand
You need a minute to breathe
And to sew up the seams
After all this defeat

And we waited for the sirens
That never come
And we only write by the moon
Every word handwritten

And to ease the loss of youth
And the many, many years I've missed you
Pages plead forgiveness
Every word handwritten

Here in the dark, I cherish the moonlight
I'm in love with the way
You're in love with the night
And it travels from heart to limb to pen

And we waited for the sirens
That never come
And we only write by the moon
Every word handwritten
Every word handwritten

And with this pen, I thee wed
From my heart to your distress
