The day vanished in the night, soon the children pray
Pray themselves alone, the hate built from their pride
You can't take away, can't take what they own!

The eyes watching from the sky, guides them through the haze
Calling far away, the rain is black as black, black as night
Oh let them pray!

False sense of pride, satisfies
There's no reason for suicide
Use your mind, and hope to find
Find the meaning of existence...

The crys answers wonder why, why it's time to die
Time to die alone, cause I'm wasting too much time
Wandering down the live reasons why I go my own!

False sense of pride, satisfies
There's no reason for suicide
Use your mind, and hope to find
Find the meaning of existence...

The eyes watching from the sky, guides them through the haze
Calling far away, the rain is black as black, black as night
Oh let them pray!

False sense of pride, satisfies
There's no reason for suicide
Use your mind, and hope to find
Find the meaning of existence...
