I rest my case every time we kissed it left a bitter taste
On your cold lips, baby it was something that we couldn't fix
No way no way, no way no way
I can't change, can't change my ways

I hate to see you leaving but I love to watch you go
Keep staring at the ceiling when my world's about to blow
And I could chase the melody, but I let you down
I play the darkest symphony when you're around

Let the walls come down and face the fire
The end of my empire
The end of my empire
And I could chase the melody, but I let you down
I play the darkest symphony when you're around
Let the walls come down

Eighteen and life, did you ever think it would be like this?
He's got my eyes as well as whatever habits, let it be a bliss

No way no way, no way no way
You can't change, can't change your ways

I hate to see you leaving but I love to watch you go
Keep staring at the ceiling when my world's about to blow
And I could chase the melody but I let you down
I play the darkest symphony when you're around

Let the walls come down and face the fire
The end of my empire
The end of my empire
And I could chase the melody, but I let you down
I play the darkest symphony when you're around
Let the walls come down

I hate to see you leaving, but I love to watch you go
Keep staring at the ceiling when my world's about to blow
And I could chase the melody, but I let you down
I play the darkest symphony when you're around
The end of my empire
The end of my empire
The end of my empire
