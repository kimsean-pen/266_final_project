Two, three, four

We could fly to the moon
Get there by tomorrow afternoon
I don't wanna speak too soon
But I think I love you
I'm red, look inside
Check out all the things I try to hide
I don't wanna speak too soon
But I think I'd like you to

Yeah, we got magic in our hands
We play in the stars when the sun comes up
Get into my bed
I don't wanna speak too soon
But I think I love you
I don't wanna speak too soon

We could swim in the sea
Beyond where we should be
Maybe could go back in
Thought I saw a shark fin
We could live in a haunted house
See how long 'til we move out
I don't wanna speak too soon
But I think I want you

Yeah, we got magic in our hands
We play in the stars when the sun comes up
Get into my bed
I don't wanna speak too soon
But I think I love you
I don't wanna speak too soon

We got magic in our hands
Magic in our hands

Yeah, we got magic in our hands
We play in the stars when the sun comes up
Get into my bed
I don't wanna speak too soon
But I think I love you
I don't wanna speak too soon

I don't wanna safe
I don't wanna safe
When the sun comes up
Get into my bed
