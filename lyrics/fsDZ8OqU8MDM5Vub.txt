God won't talk to me
I guess she's pretty busy lately
I'd like to believe
She's listening

I'm starting to feel
All of my bruises imagined or real
I'll get through each day
I dig through the bad ones
To get to the good ones
Who's keeping score anyway?

And this is my beautiful life
The only thing certain is everything changes
the lows and the highs
And all those goodbyes
As hard as it gets I know it's still amazing
To be alive
It's a beautiful life

I talk in my sleep
That's the one place I know no one can hear me
I tell myself things
Don't walk in the shadows, there's always tommorow
And I'm right where I wanna be

And this is my beautiful life
The only thing certain is everything changes
The lows and the highs
And all those goodbyes
As hard as it gets I know it's still amazing
To be alive
Oh it hurts while it happening I want to feel everything

How will you know till you try?
And this is my beautiful life
My beautiful life

The only thing certain is everything changes
The lows and the highs
And all those goodbyes
As hard as it gets I know it's still amazing
To be alive
It's a beautiful life
