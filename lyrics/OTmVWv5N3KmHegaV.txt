You hold me down, right on time, love of my life
You showed up, and showed me so wrong, you were right
Alone in this ocean, floating in the moonlight
At home with the notion it's me, myself, and I

I was the live fast, car crash, Mulholland Drive
Open the flood gates, this love-hate is making me cry
But tears fill the tub with the blood from your wrist that night

If we should live forever
Like sweet vampires
When we can reign together
Our own empire
Now we should try to sever
All our past ties
But it's me and you
And the skies are blue
Both bleeding from our eyes

I was a love-sick, dumb dick, top off the stock
Came to shove, when you push and locked his keys in his car
I feel like an animal that's been kicked around too long
In me, loose electric circuitry that's been wired all wrong

If we should live forever
Like sweet vampires
When we can reign together
Our own empire
Now we should try to sever
All our past ties
But it's me and you
And the skies are blue
Both bleeding from our eyes

Now where the hell have you
Gone off and flown away to
Some shithole you call home
(Some asshole)
Told me I won't survive
Somehow, I'm scraping by
We're reduced to ruin
Rubble, rags and bones

If we should live forever
Like sweet vampires
When we can reign together
Our own empire
Now we should try to sever
All our past ties
But it's me and you
And the skies are blue
Both bleeding from our eyes

Both bleeding from our eyes
Both bleeding from our eyes
Both bleeding from our eyes
Both bleeding from our eyes
