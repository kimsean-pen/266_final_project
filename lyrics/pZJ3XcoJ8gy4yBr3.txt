Theres a place in the back of my head
I keep it dark, let no one in
Theres a heart somewhere in my chest
Is there a beat? Does it exist?

Will I ever feel anything
Will I ever see the end of my story

I'm so haunted by who I used to be
A brighter version that I left behind
Wasted my innocence
Seeing anger with my open eyes

Bring me back to a time where I didn't tear things down
Bring me back to a life where I wasn't so let down

Am I here to live like I'm broken
Am I here to lose my way?
Separate me from the sorrow
Give me hope for another day

I feel a space in the back of my head
I don't feel the same, I just feel ashamed
Everyday pounding in my chest
Like a title wave that I can't escape

Bring me back to a time where I didn't tear things down
Bring me back to a time where I wasn't so let down

Am I here to live like I'm broken
Am I here to lose my way?
Separate me from the sorrow
Give me hope for another day

I can't turn back time, but I can let it go
I'm fighting back against the poison in my soul
I'm fighting back against the poison in my soul

Bring me back to a time where I didn't tear things down
Bring me back to a life where I wasn't so, wasn't so let down

Am I here to live like I'm broken
Am I here to lose my way?
Separate me from the sorrow
Give me hope for another day, day
Give me hope for one more day
