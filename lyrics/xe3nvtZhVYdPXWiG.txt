It's so easy, but I can't do it
So risky, but I gotta chance it
It's so funny, there's nothing to laugh about
My money, that's all you want to talk about
I can see what you want me to be, but I'm no fool

It's in the lap of the Gods, ooh
I can see what you want me to be, but I'm no fool

No beginning, there's no ending
There's no meaning in my pretending
Believe me, life goes on and on and on
Forgive me when I ask you where do I belong
You say "I- (You can do it)
Can't- (You can do it)
Set you free- (You can go and set him free)
From me", but that's not true

It's in the lap of the Gods
Wo, wo, la, la, la, wo
I can see what you want me to be, but I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
Wo, wo, la, la, la, wo
Wo, wo, la, la
Wah, wah, ooh
But that's not true
It's in the lap of the Gods

Wo, wo, la, la, la, wo
Wo, wo, la, la
Wah, wah, ooh
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods

Wo, wo, la, la, la, wo
Wo, wo, la, la
Wah, wah, ooh
It's in the lap of the Gods

Wo, wo, la, la, la, wo
Wo, wo, la, la
Wah, wah, ooh
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods

Wo, wo, la, la, la, wo
Wo, wo, la, la
Wah, wah, ooh
