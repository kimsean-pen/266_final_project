I see him dive towards me
Through an angelic canopy
And when he sounds patience breath
He pours himself into my lungs, my savior has come
What's luck?
What's luck got to say to questions of fate, my love?

For I've been tryin' my best to keep
Keep up above
And I'd be lyin' if I said
Never questioned what it's worth
'Cause I'm tryin', I'm tryin', but I'm dyin'
I feel life break beneath the waves

But won't let them hold me
No, won't let them hold me down, no more
I breathe the breath of light

See her rise with beauty
Indifferent to mortality
Holding my severed wrists
Like a mountain made to fall
She collapses in a motion to drown me
And I wouldn't take this breath
If he hadn't dove down and found me

For I've been tryin' my best to keep, keep up above
And I'd be lyin' if I said
Never questioned what it's worth
I'm tryin', I'm tryin', but I'm dyin'
I feel life break beneath the waves

But won't let them hold me
No, won't let them hold me down
No, won't let them hold me
No, won't let them hold me down

It's all I got
(Iron walls of waves are breakin' over me)
But it's enough to breathe the dyin' light of love
(Iron walls of waves are breakin' over me)
And it's enough to breathe the dyin' light of love
(Iron walls of waves are breakin' over me)
And it's enough to breathe the dyin' light of love
(Iron walls of waves are breakin' over me)

But won't let them hold me down
No, won't let them hold me
No, won't let them hold me down
No, won't let them hold me
No, won't let them hold me down
No more
I breathe the breath of light
