I'm so glad that I got her
to think of
she's fine as any valentine
I think about her all the time
cross my heart and hope to die

She sends me silly messages
and pictures
directing traffic in the mall
or posing with some brand new shoes
she never fails to surprise

She makes me laugh
she makes me smile
and I could hang out
with her all day and night
She makes me laugh
she makes me cry
and I would like to be with her for a while

I'm so glad that I got her
to think of
we'll have a dinner date tonight
and play some scrabble with the guys
and wear our pink party hats

Maybe I should take her on Safari
you'll see us wave from our Canoe
If that's what she wants to do
tell me what's wrong with that

She makes me laugh
she makes me smile
and I could hang out
with her all day and night
She makes me laugh
she makes me cry
and I would like to be with her for a while

No matter whatever else I do
she's still the girl I should hold on to
No matter whatever else I do
she's still the girl I should hold on to
No matter whatever else I do
she's still the girl
still the girl

She makes me laugh
she makes me smile
and I could hang out
with her all day and night
She makes me laugh
she makes me cry
and I would like to be with her
for a while
