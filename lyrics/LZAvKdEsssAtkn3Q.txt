Add nice sugar and spice
I'll take you on a cruise
To somewhere nice
You haven't been before
Love was meant for more

You moved up close
I could feel your sweat
I kissed you on the neck
And you got wet
It's a shallow treat
For a guy like me

Everybody's looking at you
Like they want to
Like they want to
Go home with you

Everybody's looking at you
Like they want to
Everybody's looking at you
Like they want to

Everybody's looking at you
Like they want to
Like they want to
Go home with you

I've got nothin'
Keeping me here
I've wasted all the love
That I hold dear

I'll throw a dart, L.A
The wolf has run away
The guy you know
Thinks he's so slick

He'll kiss you on the lips
But he'll get sick
Lothario
He's a creep you know

Everybody's looking at you
Like they want to
Like they want to
Go home with you

Everybody's looking at you
Like they want to
Everybody's looking at you
Like they want to

Everybody's looking at you
Like they want to
Like they want to
Go home with you

I'm on your trail
I can smell your blood
I've had enough
With unrequited love

It's the coast I crave
Leads me to my grave
Fill in my head
Was the sick of my spine

Give it up
And I will make you mine
I will buy you things
Like diamond rings

Everybody's looking at you
Like they want to
Like they want to
Go home with you

Everybody's looking at you
Like they want to
Everybody's looking at you
Like they want to

Everybody's looking at you
Like they want to
Like they want to
Go home with you
