Half a mind to leave the ground
Our days like silk, all spun around
You kept me close, one inch off the cosmos
Where you're never alone
Blue wings to lift me up
(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)
Under the wire comes my love
(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)
Blue wings to lift me up
(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)
Under the wire comes my love
(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)
All my fears in a steam room stall
I sweat and sweat 'til I've had enough
'Til I'm in first place
'Til our horse comes out ahead
And my chest is full
Blue wings to lift me up
(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)
Under the wire comes my love
(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)
Blue wings to lift me up
(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)
Under the wire comes my love
(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)
There goes my life
There goes
