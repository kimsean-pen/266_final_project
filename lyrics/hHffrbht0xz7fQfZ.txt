Choice was made for me
Now I don't know when I should leave
Never guess too late
Or you will be the one to wait

Is it right to stay?
Is home a trap and growth a phase?
Never guess too late
Or you will be the one to wait

To wanders my reprise
Death a drift of western grey
Leave it behind
Dissolve it into dusk away

And you know that I will miss you
But I'm selling everything
And you're easy to come back to
But its much more work to leave

Choice was made for me
Now I don't know when I should leave
Never guess too late
Or you will be the one to wait

Is it right to stay?
Is home a trap and growth a phase?
Never guess to late
Or you will be the one to wait

And you know that I will miss you
But I'm selling everything
And you're easy to come back to
But its much more work to leave

Or you will be the one to wait...
