I caught you by the boats at night
Satchels bobbing in the tide
I knew, I felt my words desert me
I caught you where the boats get tied
Off to live a different life
I knew, I felt myself get angry
I caught you where the boats sail off
Like you tied me to the dock
I fold, I felt the world desert me
I caught you where the boats get gone
Waterline slow rise above
My neck, like all the water burning
But in that fire you caught my gaze
Put a hand up to my face
"Get in, you know you're coming with me."
We left the other boats behind
Old town bobbing in the tide
I knew that you would not desert me
I caught you by the boats at night
Satchels bobbing in the tide
I knew, I felt my words desert me
I caught you where the boats get tied
Off to live a different life
I knew, I felt myself get angry
But in that fire you caught my gaze
Put a hand up to my face
"Get in, you know you're coming with me."
We left the other boats behind
Old town bobbing in the tide
I knew that you would not desert me
I knew that you would not desert me
