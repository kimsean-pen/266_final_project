All the beauty in your face
And all the anger seperates us
Smile when you're not afraid to die
But I'm afraid with each goodbye

Lost the sun above my head
Lost myself in things I said
And why is all you ever see
Your why behind the scream
And all it means to me

Will you rely?
I'm forgiven
I'm forgiven

When you've been gone
Lost and elapsed again
Lost and elapsed again
I'm forgiven

Naahaaaa

Lost and elapsed again

Lost and elaps...

And you've been gone
Lost and elapsed again
Lost and elapsed
