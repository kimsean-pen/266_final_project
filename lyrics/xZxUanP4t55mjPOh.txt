Walkin' down the kings road,
I see so many faces
They come from many places
They come down for the day
They walk around together
And try and look trendy
I think it's a shame
That they all look the same
(Chorus):
Here they come
la la la la la la
la la la la la la
The part time punks!
Here they come
la la la la la la
la la la la la la
The part time punks!
Then they go to Rough Trade
To buy Siouxsie and the Banshees
They heard John Peel play it
Just the other night
They'd like to buy the O Level single
or Read about Seymour
But they're not pressed in red
So they buy The Lurkers instead
Here they come
la la la la la la
la la la la la la
The part time punks!
Here they come
la la la la la la
la la la la la la
The part time punks!
They play their records very loud
And pogo in the bedroom
In front of the mirror
But only when their mums gone out
They pay 5 pence fares on the buses
And they never use toothpaste
But they got two fifty to go and see The Clash.
Tonight!
Here they come
la la la la la la
la la la la la la
The part time punks!
Here they come
la la la la la la
la la la la la la
The part time punks!
The part time punks!
The part time punks!
The part time punks
