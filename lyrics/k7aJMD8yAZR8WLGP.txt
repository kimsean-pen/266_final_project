The unfolding of the year
and now our season is here
All the balances are clear
now that our time is here
In our perfect present tense
through our wide rose tinted lens
When the words have all been spent
will we still have learned it?

Through your window see the place
like a fond and sweet embrace
For a moment face to face
in the sweetest embrace

ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

The unfolding of the year
and now our season is here
All the balances are clear
now that our time is here

now that our time is here
