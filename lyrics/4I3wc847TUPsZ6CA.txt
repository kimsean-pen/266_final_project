I dont like to be alone in the night
And I dont like to hear Im wrong when Im right
And I dont like to have the rain on my shoe

But I do love you, but I do love you
I dont like to see the sky painted gray
And I dont like when nothings going my way
And I dont like to be the one with the blues
But I do love you, but I do love you

Love everything about the way youre loving me
The way you lay your head
Upon my shoulder when you sleep
And I love to kiss you in the rain
I love everything you do, oh I do
I dont like to turn the radio on

Just to find I missed my favorite song
And I dont like to be the last with the news
But I do love you, but I do love you
Love everything about the way youre loving me
The way you lay your head

Upon my shoulder when you sleep

And I love to kiss you in the rain
I love everything you do, oh I do
And I dont like to be alone in the night
And I dont like to hear Im wrong when Im right
And I dont like to have the rain on my shoes
But I do love you but I do love you
But I do love you but I do love you
