Trees of green and red roses too
I'll watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Well I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white
And the brightness of day I like the dark
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands saying "How do you do?"
They're really saying "I, I love you"

I hear babies cry and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than we'll know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands saying "How do you do?"
They're really saying "I, I love you. I love you"

I hear babies cry and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than we'll know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
What a wonderful world
