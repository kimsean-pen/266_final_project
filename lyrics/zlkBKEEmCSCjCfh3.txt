Suddenly it came for me
Like a shock to the core
It's not like we
Stand up and leave
But I thought I was free
Someone could have told me
You're lost in the headlights
But I cant help it
When I am solo
Pretending like I have a purpose
Well now that's long gone
Something's missing

When I am
Solo, solo, solo, solo

Come back to me
You begged of me
Well you don't have to be
What they ask you to be
It's true I'm afraid of the morning
I'm afraid of the evening
But I can't help it
When I am
Solo
Pretending like I have a purpose
Well now that's long gone
'Cause something is missing

When I am solo
Solo, solo, solo, solo

Oh, ohhh

Something's missing
When I am
Solo, solo, solo, solo
When I am
Solo, solo, solo, solo
Solo, solo, solo, solo
Solo, solo, solo, solo

Solo, solo, solo, solo (I'm afraid of you)
Solo, solo, solo, solo (I'm afraid of the evening)
Solo, solo, solo, solo
Solo, solo, solo, solo

Solo, solo, solo, solo
Solo, solo, solo, solo
Solo, solo, solo, solo...
