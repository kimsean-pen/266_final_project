Teach your kids
To recognize and despise all the propaganda
Filtered down
By the dead echelons mainstream media

Hey, hey, hey, hey, you know me well
My love, I'd do anything for you
Society's hell
You need me just like I need you

Weren't we all
Born to mourn and to yawn at the occupations
That control
Every day of our lives we can't live as we wish
Live as we wish, live as we wish

You know me well
My love, I'd do anything for you
Society's hell
You need me just like I need you
Oh, oh, you know me well
My love, I'd do anything for you
Society's hell
You need me just like I need you

We all go
Our own ways separately in the same direction
And here am I
Every night of my life always missing someone

I'd like to be
Rotted out just before I become aware of the pain
The more I wish
In my heart for someone less likely they come
