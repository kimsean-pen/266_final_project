Sunshine in the distance
Making plans, oh-mh
Heavenly clich√© in the sky
I think I'm back in love

Every house in the distance
They volunteer, they wanna see love
They wanna settle down now
And if we wait there time will sink you
So volunteer, you wanna see love
You wanna settle down now

They volunteer, they wanna see love
They wanna settle down now
They volunteer, they wanna see love
They wanna settle down now

And if we're gonna make it
Make it proper
Cause even if the sun burns out
You'll find I'm gonna love you
I'm over the rain
I wanna settle down a little
So we can breathe again

Every house in the distance
They volunteer, they wanna see love
They wanna settle down now
And if we wait there time will sink you
I volunteer, I wanna see love
I wanna settle down now

They volunteer, they wanna see love
They wanna settle down now
They volunteer, they wanna see love
They wanna settle down now

All I want
Is to get out to the country
Where everything is green
And the blues they don't follow me, ah no

(They volunteer, they wanna see love
They wanna settle down now
They volunteer, they wanna see love
They wanna settle down now
They volunteer, they wanna see love
They wanna settle down now
They volunteer, they wanna see love
They wanna settle down now)
