Vultures descend
Feeding on us
There's no sympathy
Breeding the hate
Turn away, run away from
All the things we have to do

And it tears away our hearts and our soul

It's like we're on our own
To figure out, cast out
Paralyzed, rewind, there's no time
And the wasteland, it's an indication

We're only taking turns
Passing around the world
It's how it's always been

Out of excuses
Will we understand?

That we are on our own
To figure out, cast out
Paralyzed, this time
We have found the wasteland

Out of excuses
Will we understand?

It's like we're on our own
To figure out, cast out
Paralyzed, this time
We have found the wasteland
The wasteland, yeah
