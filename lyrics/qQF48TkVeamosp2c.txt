Someone's gonna get hurt
Someone's gonna get hurt
And it's not gonna be me

Good morning gorgeous
I drove your truck in the lake last night
Hope she was worth it
Don't worry, I slept just fine
You keep throwing punches but you won't win this fight
You're just fucking yourself when you don't read the signs
I'm going to the kitchen, coming back with a knife
'Cause I've had enough this time

This is your final warning
There's a dark cloud overhead
This is your final warning
Just remember what I said
'Cause someone's gonna get hurt
Someone's gonna get hurt
And it's not gonna be me

Good afternoon, dear
How does the rope feel around your neck?
Just one more error
Could be a fatal step
You keep throwing punches but you won't win this fight
You're just fucking yourself when you don't read the signs
I'm going to the kitchen, coming back with a knife
'Cause I've had enough this time

This is your final warning
There's a dark cloud overhead
This is your final warning
Just remember what I said
'Cause someone's gonna get hurt
Someone's gonna get hurt
And it's not gonna be me

'Cause your the one thing
You are, you are
The one thing
'Cause your the one thing
You are, you are the one

This is your final warning
There's a dark cloud overhead
This is your final warning
Just remember what I said
'Cause someone's gonna get hurt
Someone's gonna get hurt
And it's not gonna be me

'Cause your the one thing
You are, you are
The one thing
'Cause your the one thing
You are, you are
The one thing
