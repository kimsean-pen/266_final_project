They say music is the food of love
Let's see if you're hungry enough
Take a bite, take another
Just like a good boy would

Get a sweet thing on the side
Home cooking, homicide
Side order, could be your daughter
Finger licking good

Come on baby, eat the rich
Put the bite on the son of a bitch
Don't mess up, don't you give me no switch
Come on baby, and eat the rich
Come on baby, and eat the rich

Sittin' down in a restaurant
Tell the waiter just what you want
Is that the meat you wanted to eat?
How would you ever know?

Hash browns and bacon strips
I love the way that you lick your lips
No fooling, I can see you drooling
Feel the hunger grow

Come on baby, eat the rich
Put the bite on the son of a bitch
Don't mess up, don't you give me no switch
Come on baby, and eat the rich
Come on baby, and eat the rich
Come on honey, here's your supper
Come on baby, bite that sucker

I'll eat you, baby, you eat me
Eat two, baby get one free
Shetland pony, extra pepperoni
Just pick up the phone

Eat Greek or eat Chinese
Eat salad or scarf up grease
You're on the shelf, you eat yourself
Come on and bite my bone

Come on baby, eat the rich
Bite down on the son of a bitch
Don't mess around, don't you give me no switch
Come on baby, and eat the rich
Come on baby, and eat the rich
Sittin' here in a hired tuxedo
You wanna see my bacon torpedo

Eat it baby, eat the rich
Eat it baby, eat the rich
Eat it baby, eat the rich
Eat it baby, eat the rich
