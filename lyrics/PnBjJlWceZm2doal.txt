You came up to me, persistent as can be
You've done this thing a hundred times
I can never tell, had me under your spell
I fell for all your stupid lines

Everyone told me
That I should know my worth
And then when you hold me
I know it shouldn't hurt

And so I took the nights and heights
And I just threw 'em in the trash
They didn't matter at all
And I played my favorite song
Turned up the volume and I danced
I didn't care anymore

I'm better than I've ever looked
And boy, I never felt this cool
I saw you with that other girl
And all I thought was, ooh
I dodged a bullet with you

Selfish little mess, you hated all my friends
You always had to get your way
Every night at 3 AM
You had another reason why you couldn't stay

Everyone told me
That I should know my worth
And then when you hold me
I know it shouldn't hurt

And so I took the nights and heights
And I just threw 'em in the trash
They didn't matter at all
And I played my favorite song
Turned up the volume and I danced
I didn't care anymore

I'm better than I've ever looked
And boy, I never felt this cool
I saw you with that other girl
And all I thought was, ooh
I dodged a bullet with you

Dodged a bullet with you

And so I took the nights and heights
And I just threw 'em in the trash
They didn't matter at all
And I played my favorite song
Turned up the volume and I danced
I didn't care anymore
I'm better than I've ever looked
And boy, I never felt this cool
I saw you with that other girl
And all I thought was, ooh
I dodged a bullet with you
