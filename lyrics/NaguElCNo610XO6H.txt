Midnight, on a forgotten cemetery
No stars, just a black sky
The moon shines red
Horrible sounds in the night, it is Sabbath

Why are you here?
You've disturbed the Sabbath
You know the punishment
There's only one solution
Death!

Wolves howl
Witches dance around the stake
Serene holy Hell, preachers pray
They pray to Satan, his majesty is here

Why are you here?
You've disturbed the Sabbath
You know the punishment
There's only one solution
Death!

You look confused and I know why
Now you see sacrifices, feel the flames, feel the fear

Now it's too late, you can't escape
Your fear builds up, look at death â€“ Where's your God now?

Why did you come?
The ceremony has ended
You know the punishment
Death, death, death!
