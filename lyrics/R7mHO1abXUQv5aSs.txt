Can't you hear me calling your name, girl
i'm standing, standing in the red, red Rain
in the morning, standing in the red, Red Rain
can't you hear me? can't you hear me calling your name, girl?
in the morning, when i'm standing in the red, Red Rain, girl
in the morning, i'm standing in the red, Red Rain
can't you hear me? can't you hear me calling your name, girl?
in the morning, when i'm standing in the red, Red Rain, girl

you think not telling is the same as not lying, don't you?
then i guess not feeling is the same as not crying to you
you think not telling is the same as not lying, don't you?
then i guess not feeling is the same as not crying to you

in the red, in the rain, in the rain
in the red, in the red, in the rain, in the rain
in the red, in the red, in the rain, in the rain
in the red, in the red, in the rain, in the rain

if there is a lie, then there is a liar, too
and if there is a sin, then there is a sinner, too
and if there is a lie, then there is a liar, too
and if there is a sin, then there is a sinner, too

in the red, in the red, in the rain, in the rain
i'm in red, i'm in red, in the rain, in the rain
in the red, in the red, in the rain, in the rain
i'm in red, i'm in red, in the rain, in the rain
i'm in red, i'm in red, in the rain, in the rain

can't you hear me? can't you hear me calling your name, girl?
