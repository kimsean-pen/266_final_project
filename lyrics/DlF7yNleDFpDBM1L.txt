You went away
Cause you said that you can't stand me
So I went away
I was sure that you can't stand me
Well I don't think we have to be like this
forever
Is there more to life than love and being
together?
You went away
Cause you said you couldn't love me
I went away
Cause all I do is love you
Well I don't think we have to be like this
forever
There's more to life than love and being together
When my loud guitar comes in
My thumpin' drums come through
When my loud guitar comes in
My thumpin' drums come through
My loud guitar comes in
My thumpin' drums come through
Well I don't think we have to be like this
forever
There's more to life than love and being together
There's more to life than love and being together
Is there more to life than love and being
together?
I went away
