Stop and stare
You're leaving here for the last time...
Disappear...
Without a fear
It's been a long time coming

Only the good die young
But it's the ones that are found
Who've seen it all come around
Dream on without a sound
It's been a long time coming

Wasting your call
Tainted after all...
Breaking your fall
Just to sever that...
Just remember that

Only the good die young
But it's the ones that are found
Who've seen it all come around
Dream on without a sound
It's been a long time coming
