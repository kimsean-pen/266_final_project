Drive me slow, down the road
Sound the horn on every bend.
Bow your heads, respect the dead
For he had many, many friends.
Now follow the road, through the tunnel of trees
To the big, wide open field.
And take a left, up the muddy track
To the house where I grew up...

And here is the place, when I die,
I want you to bury me
Beneath this old, willow tree
Enough of an epitaph for me.
And here is the place, when I die,
I want you to bury me
These friendly roots will hold my bones
And I will never be alone.

Stop the car, on the track
Stoop to kiss me - I can't kiss you back
Shed no tears, for all the years
You've made up for what I lacked.
And heave me up, to head height
On the shoulders of my friends.
And lay me down, on the lawn
When all the curtains have been drawn...

And here is the place, when I die,
I want you to bury me
Beneath this old, willow tree
Enough of an epitaph for me
And here is the place, when I die,
I want you to bury me
These friendly roots will hold my bones
And I will never be alone.
