Hiding from the one I need the most
A secret I've kept locked away that might have saved us both
All the lies, we're turning for the worse
The truth might not be what you want but what you deserve

If you just let me in
I'll tell you everything

The heart of mine you thought you owned alone
I've lost it on the way so long ago
And now all I ask of you
Opening the wounds

If you just let me in for the last time, my love, I swear
I'll tell you everything one more time, just one more time
But all the things I said before they only made you close that door
So just let me in, just let me in

I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know, you're better off alone

If you just let me in
I'll tell you everything
But all the things I said before they only made you close that door
So just let me in, just let me in
