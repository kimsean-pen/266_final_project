(L. Reed)

Ginni said when she was five years old
You know there's nothing going down at all
She turned on that radio
And there was nothing happenin' at all
She turned on that LA station
Couldn't believe what she heard at all
She started dancing to that fine fine music
Her life was saved by rock and roll

Despite all the complications
You could just dance to that rock and roll station
And it was alright
It was alright
It was alright
It was alright, you betcha

Ginni said when she was five years old
You know our parents will be the death of us all
Two TV sets and two cadillac cars
Well they don't mean nothin' at all
She turned on that LA station
Couldn't believe what she heard at all
She started dancin' to that fine fine music
Her life was saved by rock and roll

Despite all the complications
You could just dance to that rock and roll station
And it was alright
It was alright
It was alright
It was alright, you betcha
