I don't believe it
I won't believe it
I'm not sad
I understand that's how it goes

Take it easy
There's no time to be mad
That's their job
Blood on their teeth
Death on their mind

Pretty baby
Please just get out of the way
Where it's safe

Eyes will follow you
Weapons can't break through
Tears will swallow you
They all can see right through...

Bulletproof glass
Bulletproof glass
Bulletproof - you won't have any trouble now
But who knows
But who knows

Please don't deceive me
I'm just so easily fooled
But there's some things they do not want the answers to
Don't wanna bring all that up
But they keep leaving it out
What to do?
We'll just let it be until they all need...

Bulletproof glass
Bulletproof glass
Bulletproof - you won't have any trouble now
But who knows
But who knows

If you wanna know somebody
Might take a quick look at their best friends:
Diamonds are hers / a dog is his
You can lie to yourself
But don't lie to me
That's what they want:
Dominance and loyalty / romance and security
Just stay behind...

Oh, Oh
