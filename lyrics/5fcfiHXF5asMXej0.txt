I haven't seen a Jesus in my life
No wonders and no golden paradise
Are you still too blind to see the truth?
Your gods are dead and they will never rise

Submission to illusions of your fear
Afraid to be alone if doom is near
Worship your gods and pray your love
Keep silent derision from above

Aversion for your failed gods
Religion has bloody thorns

Naive belief in "holy" lies
Ignore the sad truth - close your eyes
Adherrence to a cross - symbol of death
Follow a dead mean with thousand voices
