Picked yourself up
Stop loving, start living
Don't get held back
That's where they want you to be

I never paid much attention to them

Every time they pushed us aside
We got back up again
Yeah we made it through the rain
Just to live another day without them

Pick yourself back up and learn to live
Stop caring, stop thinking
Picked yourself back up and learn to live
The grass is greener on the other side, so don't give up on life

Never back down, do this for yourself
You don't need anyone to get you where you deserve

I never paid much attention to them

Every time they push us aside
We jump back up again
Yeah, we made it through the rain
Just to live another day without them

Every time they push us aside
We jump back up again
Yeah, we made it through the rain
Just to live another day without them

We are the ones you left out in the rain
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again
We are the ones you left out in the rain
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again

We are the ones you left out in the rain
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again
We are the ones you left out in the rain
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again

Here againâ€¦

We made it through the rain just to live another day
We made it through the rain just to live another day
We made it through the rain just to live another day
We made it through the rain, the rain
