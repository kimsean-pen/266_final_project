Push back beyond the need, the thing you want to be.
You're trying to break us down.
Glitter, shine, Overrun everyone.
The only thing that matters in your twisted mind –
success at any cost – ongoing fight.
I wanna have control.

Cold, so cold and distant is that goal of your dreams
(Inside us – walls inside us).
In time you'll face the menace that will demolish your life in bliss
(Inside us – walls inside us).

Lay down. Hide yourself. Hold your breath.
You built a wall around yourself.
Feel the burden of the stones.
Mind is secured and sealed.
Oblivion forevermore.
The only thing that matters in your twisted mind,
admiration at any cost ongoing fight.
I wanna have control.

Unstoppable oblivion.

Im not gonna take it any- more.
You'll never have control.
You'll never see us fall.
You'll never make the rules.
You'll never have it all.
