I don't know,
what am I doing here?
Theres a shadow in my place

Maybe now
Everything will be so clear
You shed a light into this empty space

And all I am
all I have
doesn't even matter now
I can't understand why I feel this way
But I do
I do

I just wanna love you when the goings tough
I just wanna hold you when your not enough
I just wanna give you everything I got
I do
I do

I don't know
what am I saying here?
Theres a hole in my heart and its begging please
Maybe now
Everything will be so clear
Cos your all I'll ever need

All I know is
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna touch your soul
I do
I do

I just wanna hold you when the goings tough
I just wanna love you when your not enough
I just wanna give you all that I can give
I do
I do

I just wanna kiss you in the morning sun
I just wanna love you when the day is done
I just wanna hold you just because I can

I just wanna fold you up into my arms
I just wanna listen to your beating heart
I just wanna love you just because I do
I do
I do
