We know where all the red ferns grow
Two feet against me, but beyond my reach
Six keys, one whole heart for each, one whole wave for me
Grass stains cut my bloody knees, it's goodpain it means I can't be phased

That little death inside my sides won't make it right
He wins every time I find myself inside, alone all night
I'll be howling keeping you between my eyes, there I'll be alright
I'll be howling keeping you between my eyes, there I'll be alright

Rorschach the pieces that I lack
I felt stained, cold beneath the waves, behind my suchered face
Cursed down, throw my certain doubt, let me let you down

That little death inside my sides won't make it right
He wins every time I find myself inside, alone all night
I'll be howling keeping you between my eyes, there I'll be alright
I'll be howling keeping you between my eyes, there I'll be alright
