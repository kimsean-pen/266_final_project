Movement was the thing that made me stop
It made me stop
Movement was the thing that sent me off
It sent me off
Movement was my only tell
Runnin' through the door yelling what the hell
I'm moving while you talk ya talk
Don't talk shit gon' break ya jaw
Movement was my only chance
Full speed ahead was my only plan
I'm moving while you talk ya talk
Don't talk shit gon' break ya jaw
I'm moving up and on the run
Somebody better help me son
I'm moving up and on the run
Somebody better save me son
Who cares if ya trace my same steps
Some days I wake up brain dead
me up on life support
Will somebody tell me what I'm fightin' for
Same shit still rich now I'm runnin' up
Same shit, risin' I'm comin' up
Same shit still rich now I'm runnin' up
Same shit, risin' I'm comin' up
I'm coming up
My movements coming up
Bitch I'm coming up
My movements coming up
Movement was my only tell
Runnin' through the door yellin' what the hell
I'm moving while you talk ya talk
Don't talk shit gon' break ya jaw
Movement was my only chance
Full speed ahead was my only plan
I'm moving while you talk ya talk
Don't talk shit gon' break ya jaw
I'm movin' up and on the run
Somebody better help me son
I'm movin' up and on the run
Somebody better save me son
I speed up I go faster
No shit I just rolled right past ya
me up on life support
Will somebody tell me what I'm fightin' for
Same shit still rich now I'm running up
Same shit, risin' I'm coming up
Same shit still rich now I'm running up
Same shit, Risin' I'm coming up
I'm coming up
My movements coming up
Bitch I'm coming up
I'm movements coming up
