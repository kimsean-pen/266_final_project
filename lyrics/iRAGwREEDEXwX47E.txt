You're such an inspiration for the ways
That I will never ever chose to be
Oh so many ways for me to show you
How your savior has abandonned you

(Fuck your God)
Your Lord, your Christ
(He did this)
Took all you had and
(Left you this way)
Still you pray, never stray, never
(Never taste of the fruit)
Never thought to question why

It's not like you killed someone
It's not like you drove a hateful spear into His side
Praise the one who left you broken down and paralyzed
He did it all for you
He did it all for you

Oh so many ways for me to show you
How your dogma has abandonned you

(Pray)
To your Christ, to your God
(Never taste of the fruit)
Never stray, never break, never
(Choke on a lie)
Even though he's the one
(Who did this to you)
Never thought to question why

Not like you killed someone
It's not like you drove a spiteful spear into His side
Talk to Jesus Christ as if he knows the reasons why
He did it all for you
He did it all for you
Did it all for you
