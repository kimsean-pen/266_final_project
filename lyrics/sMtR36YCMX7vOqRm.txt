Pretending everything is fine won't help
You say you happy with the shit that sells
This fucken life really sounds like hell
I hope you're happy with the Lies Yxu Tell yourself
Don't act like you're no sinner

This time, I shall not forget, this time I rise from the dead, this time I'm not afraid
I don't see the meaning in these fucken games

Change facts live fast it helps us to forget pain
Reach back no thanks I still got against grains
Point fingers away don't blame till they break
Hype up and see your life's covered in flames

I'm so done with the waiting
Will I find my relief from this mind
My whole body is craving
A better way of living my life

Mind your business
Lost control of all my feelings
I'm still sat here in this building
Fucken dying, fucken breathing
You're not happy you're still bleeding
Your existence has no meaning
And it makes you fucking sick

I hope you're happy with the Lies Yxu Tell yourself
