Is everything alright?
I just called to say
How lost I feel
without you
Miles away
I really can't believe I'm here
And how I still care about you.

Hearts can break and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts can cry
When love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way.

Is everything the same?
Do you ever think of me
And how we loved one another
Will you change your mind
Will you want me back again
Or have you found yourself a new lover?

Hearts can break and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts can cry
When love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way.

Is everything ok?
I just thought I'd write a song
To tell the world
How much I miss you
'Cause each and every day
I think of all the words I never said
And all the chances that I had to.

Hearts can break and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts could cry
When love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way

Hearts can be that way
Hearts can be
Is everything alright?.
