I see problems down the line
I know that I'm right
There was a dirt upon your hands
Doing the same mistake twice
Making the same mistake twice

Come on over and be so caught up
It's not about compromising

I see problems down the line
I know that I'm right
I see darkness down the line
I know it's hard to fight
There was a dirt upon your hands
Doing the same mistake twice
Making the same mistake twice

Come on over
Don't be so caught up, it's all about colonizing

I see problems down the line
I know that I'm right

Don't let the darkness eat you up
Don't let the darkness eat you up
Don't let the darkness eat you up
Don't let the darkness eat you up
Don't let the darkness eat you up
Don't let the darkness eat you up
Don't let the darkness eat you up
Don't let the darkness eat you up
