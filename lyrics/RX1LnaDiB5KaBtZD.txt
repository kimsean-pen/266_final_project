All that I know is that time's moving slower than ever before
I can't get to know her and everything's always a drunk mess in hallways
It never feels right in the end
Maybe when I'm older this weight on my shoulders will sink down beneath me
You'll whisper so sweetly that nothing was ever pretend
And I know in my heart
When you pick me apart
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better
And I know in my heart
When you pick me apart
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better
All that I know is that time's moving slower than ever before
I can't get to hold her and everything's always a drunk mess in hallways
It never feels right in the end
Maybe when I'm older this weight on my shoulders will sink down beneath me
You'll whisper so sweetly that nothing was ever pretend
And I know in my heart
When you pick me apart
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better
And I know in my heart
When you pick me apart
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better
