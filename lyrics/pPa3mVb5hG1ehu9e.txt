Get back on track, pick me up some bottles of booze
Fickle freshman, probably thinks she's cooler than you
A hay ride at five, everybody's comin' around
So go press you skirt, word is there's a new girl in town.

I call shotgun, you can play your R 'n B tunes
The fellowship time, it always comes a little too soon
The land of the creeds, freshened up from baby faced shame
Put your eyes on me, and I know a place that we can get away.

Just say I want you, just exactly like I used to
'Cause baby this is only bringin' me down.

Home-boy's so proud, he finally got the video proof
The night vision shows, she was only duckin' the truth
It's heavy I know, the black guy with the gift down below
A choke and a gag, she spit up 'n came back for more.

She said I want you, just exactly like I used to
And baby this is only bringin' me down.
She said I want you

I want you, just exactly like I used to
And baby this is only bringin' me down.
I said I want you, just exactly like I used to
And baby this is only bringin' me down.
