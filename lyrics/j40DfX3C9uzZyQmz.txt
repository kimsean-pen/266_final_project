Your name in lights
Vibrating to your ringtone
My world begins to dance

We discuss important stuff
The rendezvous is set up
To catch a film and dinner

Snug in a cinema or
Saving me from a car you'll
Suddenly realize and fall into my arms
Working you undercover
Softly, slowly gotcha
Any moment now you're gonna swoon, into my arms

The same you, the same me
Spoon feeding the groundhog song
The friend too good to go there with
Let's shake it up and get it on

Mmm well I know you know you do
And maybe you've not said in so many words
You've always got your reasons
You're right little know-it-all

Snug in a cinema or
Saving me from a car you'll
Suddenly realize and fall into my arms
Working you undercover
Softly, slowly gotcha
Any moment now you're gonna swoon

Let me be the Great Scott, tip top pit stop in your ocean
I could be the shipmate what got you down and dirty with the lotion

This is where I was going to sing your name
Over and over again but I chickened out in the final minute

Cause I thought you probably wouldn't like it

Swoon and fall into my arms

Let me be the Great Scott, tip top pit stop in your ocean
I could be the shipmate what got you down and dirty with the lotion

Let me be the Great Scott, tip top pit stop in your ocean
I could be the shipmate what got you down and dirty with the lotion
