I can't let go

When I'm with you I believe
That your love is true
When we love you turn me out
You know what to do
Visions really blow my mind fantasizing all the time

When your body's next to me I begin to sweat
When we touch I lose control
Now you know what's next
Fantasizing all the time move your body next to mine
Well I need your love
I need your love
I need your love

Don't make me wait too long
Ooh I need your touch
Don't make me wait for your love

I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
