Haunt me, I just want to say that you should hold me
Like Veni Vidi Vici,
Don't let me be your escapee
Oh oh oh
Love me
Get it, get it, hold me
Follow me in 3D
Let us dance under the Judas tree
I wanna be your girl
I wanna take it seriously
I wanna be your girl
I wanna take you home
Just let me be your
Love me
Get it, get it, hold me
Google me and pin and pin me
I won't tell nobody
Serve me
Baptize me and save me
Let me be your only
I ain't looking for a résumé
I wanna be your girl
I wanna take it seriously
I wanna be your girl
I wanna take you home
Just let me be your girl
I wanna be your girl
I wanna take it seriously
I wanna be your girl
