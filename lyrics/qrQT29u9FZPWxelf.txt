The scattered pages of a book by the sea
Held by the sand and washed by the waves
A shadow forms cast by a cloud
Skimming by as eyes of the past
But the rising tide absorbs them
Effortlessly claiming

They told of one who tired of all
Singing, "Praise him, praise him"
"We heed not flatterers," he cried
"By our command, waters retreat
Show my power, halt at my feet"
But the course was lost
Now cold winds blow

For from the north
Overcast ranks advance
Fear of the storm
Accusing with rage and scorn
The waves surround the sinking throne
Singing "Crown him, crown him"

"Those who love our majesty show themselves!"
All bent their knees

But he forced a smile even though his hopes
Lay dashed where offerings fell
Where they fell

"Nothing can my peace destroy as long as none smile
More opened ears and opened eyes
And soon they dare to laugh"

See a little man with his face turning red
Though his story's often told, you can tell he's dead
