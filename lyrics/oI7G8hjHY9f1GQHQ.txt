Every little part of you won't have nobody
Loving, but we don't meant to
Can't have no money
Everything we used to do can it hurt somebody
Never really wanted to
Every little part of you

It hurts to love you like I do
Give me all of you, in the night I'm looking for heart
Hard to be with my body?
Everything you needed at the right time
Looking for love regardless, you're leaving
Give me all of you, in the night I'm looking for heart
How do you leave my body?
Everything you needed at the right time
Looking for love regardless, every little part of me
Won't hurt no more
Everything you want to be, we've been here before
Was it just a way to leave?
Oh, loving every little part of you
Every little part of me.

Nobody loves me like you do

Give me all of you, in the night I'm looking for heart
Hard to be with my body?
Everything you needed at the right time
Looking for love regardless, you're leaving
Give me all of you, in the night I'm looking for heart
Hard to be with my body?
Everything you needed at the right time
Looking for love regardless, regardless

Give me all of you, in the night I'm looking for heart
Hard to be with my body?
Everything you needed at the right time
Looking for love regardless, you're leaving
Give me all of you, in the night I'm looking for heart
Hard to be with my body?
Everything you needed at the right time
Looking for love regardless, regardless
