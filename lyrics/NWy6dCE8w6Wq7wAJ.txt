Roll out! I got my twin glock .40's, cocked back

Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that
Twin glock .40's, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that
Now where'd you get that platinum chain with them diamonds in it?
Where'd you get that matchin Benz with them windows tinted?

Who dem girls you be with when you be ridin through?
Man I ain't got nothin to prove, I paid my dues
Breakin the rules, I shake fools while I'm takin a CRUISE!
Tell me who's your weed man, and how do you smoke so good?
You'se a superstar boy, why you still up in the hood?
What in the world is in that BAG, what you got in that BAG?
A couple a cans of whoop ass, you did a good-ass job
of just eyein me, spyin me
I got my twin glock .40's, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that

We rollin on twenties, with the top back

So much money, you can't stop that
Twin glock .40's, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that
Man, that car don't come out until next year
Where in the fuck did you get it?
That's eighty-thousand bucks GONE!
Where in the fuck did you spend it?
You must have eyes on your back, cause you got money to the ceiling
And the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin
The better I'm feelin, the more that I'm chillin
Willin, drillin and killin the feelin
Now who's that bucked-naked cook fixin three-course meals?

Gettin goosebumps when her body tap the six inch heels

What in the world is in that ROOM, what you got in that ROOM?
A couple a gats, a couple of knives
A couple of rats, a couple of wives, now it's time to choose
I got my twin glock .40's, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that
Twin glock .40's, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that

Are you custom-made, custom-paid, or you just custom-fitted?

Playstation 2 up in the ride and is that Lorenzo-kitted?
Is that your wife, your girlfriend or just yo' main bitch?
You take a pick, while I'm rubbin the hips
touchin lips to the top of the dick and then WHOOO!
Now tell me who's your housekeeper and what you keep in yo' house?
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in yo' mouth?

What in the world is in that CASE, what you got in that CASE?
Get up out my face, you couldn't relate, wait to take place
at a similar pace so shake, shake it
I got my twin glock .40's, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that
Twin glock .40's, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that
