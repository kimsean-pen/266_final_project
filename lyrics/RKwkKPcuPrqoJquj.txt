She's 22
and she's loving you,
and you'll never know how it makes me blue,
does she make you happy?
I'm holding on, to the thing that's wrong
cause we don't belong,
do you like my songs?
and it makes me happy.
does she make you happy?
you can throw away
every word I say.
I'm standing still, on this hidden hill
and I'm looking around
for the right way down
to your distant valley
your flowers grow
in the frozen snow
and I'd like to know
is it all a show,
are you really happy?
are you really happy?
cause you can throw away
every word I say
you just throw away
