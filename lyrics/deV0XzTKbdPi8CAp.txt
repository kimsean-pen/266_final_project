You arrive, in the rising sun
The hidden passenger, that I've been taking
Close your eyes, let's forget again
As you drag me down, I will take you in

What are you waiting for
Just surrender here tonight
What are you waiting for
As we go towards the light

When everything is said and done
To looking for answers, if only one
Turn my back the edge has gone
Left with no reason, we've come undone

I am cold, in your slow release
Seems like your traveler is eager to move me
My reflection will slowly fade
To another time until my head escapes

What are you waiting for
Just surrender here tonight
What are you waiting for
As we go towards the light

When everything is said and done
To looking for answers, if only one
Turn my back, the edge has gone
Left with no reason, we've come undone
