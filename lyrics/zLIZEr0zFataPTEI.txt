Why do you spend all your time
watching life pass you by
hanging onto your pride
All that you can anticipate
hoping all your mistakes
will some how fade away

*bridge*
what are you to do with this
it's either hit or miss
you know the answer now
come on give your heart away
i know you hurt inside
i know the reason why
don't wait a moment
come on and give you heart away

*chorus*
why the hesitation
God is ever waiting
gotta stop procrastinating
can you feel me
why the hesitation
you can pick your destination
and the risk is so worth taking
can you hear me

your heart will never be the same
giving up drama's days
letting go uneasy ways
when will you ever realize
letting go all your lies
all the pain will subside

*bridge*
what are you to do with this
it's either hit or miss
you know the answer now
come on give your heart away
i know you hurt inside
i know the reason why
don't wait a moment
come on and give you heart away

*chorus*
why the hesitation
God is ever waiting
gotta stop procrastinating
can you feel me
why the hesitation
you can pick your destination
and the risk is so worth taking
can you hear me
(repeat chorus)

Did you
know it's so easy
so why'd you say
you're too busy
you know you need him
come on and give your heart away
letting go
why you waiting?
you're wasting time
hesitating
you know you need him
are you ready to belive?

*chorus*
why the hesitation
God is ever waiting
gotta stop procrastinating
can you feel me
why the hesitation
you can pick your destination
and the risk is so worth takin
can you hear me

whatcha need, whatcha need
whatcha want, whatcha want
whatcha need, whatcha need
(what you need is something genuine)
whatcha want, whatcha want
i'm just wondering why

*chorus*
why the hesitation
God is ever waiting
gotta stop procrastinating
can you feel me
why the hesitation
you can pick your destination
and the risk is so worth takin
can you hear me

*chorus*
why the hesitation
God is ever waiting
gotta stop procrastinating
can you feel me

why the hesitation
you can pick your destination
and the risk is so worth takin
can you hear me
(repeat chorus)
