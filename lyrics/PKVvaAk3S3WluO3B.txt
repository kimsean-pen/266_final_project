You'll be okay
You'll be alright
You'll get well soon
Sleep through the night
You'll go outside
Enjoy the sun
Soon you'll feel fine to see everyone

He's gonna thrive
He'll be just fine
Hurt for a while
Cured with time
Don't know how he's doing
But that's what you get
You can't be the one to hold him when you were the one
Who left

He's got good friends
They'll pull him in
Take him out dancing
Help to begin again
Don't know how he's doing
But that's what you get
You can't be the one to hold him when you were the one
Who left

Are you thinking of me, too?
I was so happy all those years with you

I'll be okay
I'll be alright
I'll get well soon
Sleep through the night
Don't know how you're doing
But that's what I get
I can't be the one to hold you when I was the one
Who left
