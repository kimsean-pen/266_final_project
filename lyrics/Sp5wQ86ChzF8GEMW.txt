Open my eyes first thing I see
Your lovely smile smiling at me
Kiss my forehead up out of bed
Off to start your day, here in bed I stay

Thinking 'bout last night playing in my mind
When you touch me there
Ooh, it feels so right

[Incomprehensible]
What am I doing?
Get up out of bed
To myself thinking

This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b, oh

This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b, oh
This can? t b good

What? s going on? What? s happening to me?
Promised myself that I would never let this be
Never again, never that way
Cut me so deep that I haven? t been the same

Way I feel right now, I felt before
When I hear your name and my feelings are floored
I fight it if I can but I don? t know if I should
The one thing I know
This can? t b good, babe

This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b, oh

This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b good
This can? t b

Oh, I think I? m falling in love again
(Oh no)
Told myself I never would
(Told myself I never would)
Oh, I think I? m falling in love again
This cannot b good
(This cannot b good)

This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b, oh

This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b, oh

This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b, oh

This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b good
(This can? t b good)
This can? t b, oh

This can't b good
This can't b good
This can't b good
This can't b good
