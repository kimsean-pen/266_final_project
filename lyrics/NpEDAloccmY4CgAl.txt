I was woken from silence
Torn from my dreams
A life less than perfect
More rips at the seams
You can't sew me together
To fix what's been done
I've felt it all but I can't feel numb
I've felt it all but I can't feel numb
I've felt it all but I can't feel numb

So stay away
We've been down this road before
Been barely holding on for so long

So keep spitting me out
A bad taste in your mouth
You always say to yourself
That you'll change

So stay away
We've been down this road before
Been barely holding on for so long
It's safe to say
I can't do this anymore
And I'm not the only one
It's so wrong

Take this for what it's worth
You should know
This is cutthroat
Cutthroat

So stay away
We've been down this road before
Been barely holding on for so long
It's safe to say
I can't do this anymore
I'm not the only one
It's so wrong

So stay away
We've been down this road before
Been barely holding on for so long
It's safe to say
I can't do this anymore
And I'm not the only one
It's so wrong
