Gradually I feel*
Getting to know you well
As the daylight comes
As the daylight falls
Somehow we see
No matter how we feel
If it all breaks down
Will you be standing by me
Don't want to fall in love
Again and again
Just want to let you go and
Numb the pain
We have to say goodbye and
Just be friends
Leaving, loving you has to be the hardest thing
Gradually I feel
Getting to know you well
As the walls break down
And the daylight comes
Don't want to fall in love
Again and again
Just want to let you go and
Numb the pain
We have to say goodbye and
Just be friends
Leaving, loving you has to be the hardest thing
Been around
And been around
And been around
And been around
Again and again
Again and again
I hit the wall again
Again and again
Again and again
Don't want to fall in love
Again and again
Just want to let you go and
Numb the pain
We have to say goodbye and
Just be friends
Leaving, loving you has to be the hardest thing
Don't want to fall in love
Again and again
Just want to let you go and
Numb the pain
We have to say goodbye and
Just be friends
Leaving, loving you has to be the hardest thing
