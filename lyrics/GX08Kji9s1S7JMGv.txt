She's got a box full of things
and a lot of them don't work
You don't get to see them all
see them all
see them all
today

She's got a room full of boys
and a lot of them are cute
but they don't give her what she wants
what she wants
what she wants
today

So giddyup now
she's going on a trip
she won't let them tears
fall down and drip
How ya feeling today
Oh never better
It's a chance now
She won't let it slip
She will stand up straight
and tighten her grip
The adventure will start
today -

She's got a lot on her mind
even more inside her heart
You won't get to see them all
see them all
see them all
today

She's got her eyes
on the light
getting ready for the flight
All she wants is the big blue sky
Big black sky
orange sky
purple sky

Rising up now
We're coming back to life
We are reaching for the stars tonight
Have you noticed
the sun's again on time
Yeah
Take a look now
We're finally on the clouds
We can sing of love and truth out loud
The adventure will start
Today -

Ooh â€“
I'm a free bird
Yai hoo -
Don't care what they say
I'm a free bird
Ooh
