The two minds of mine, howling again
It wakes me up
I lie outside the moonlit stress
To pick me up

Lately I am in over my head
Lay me out to watch the sun instead

Say how that it's different, you hide, I stay
The winter's rough
I move to a distance, here comes a wave
To wash you off

(You off)

Lately I am in over my head
Lay me out to watch the sun instead
Lately I am in over my head

I move to a distance, I move to a distance
Say how that it's different, say how that it's different
(Lay me out to watch the sun instead)
I move to a distance, I move to a distance
Say how that it's different, here comes a wave

(Lay me out to watch the sun instead)
