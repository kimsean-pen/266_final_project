There is just enough Christ in me
To make me feel almost guilty
Is that why God made us bleed
To make us see we're Humans Being?

You break this, I'll break all that
You break my balls with all your crap
Spread your disease like lemmings breeding
That's what makes us Humans Being

Shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on

Yeah, some low life flat head scum infects
The sickness in his eyes reflects
You wonder why your life is screaming
Wonder why we're Humans Being

Shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on

Humans, Humans Being, we're just Humans
(That's what makes us)

Humans Being
(That's what makes us)

We're just Humans
(That's what makes us)

Humans Being
(That's what makes us)
We're just humans
(That's what makes us)
Humans Being
(That's what makes us Humans Being)
We're just humans
(That's what makes us)
Humans Being
(That's what makes us Humans Being)
