When you get the rhythm and words all make you cold
When you break it down and this world is all you know
Hands up, you're waving it around
Now get yourself together
When you count the dominos fall, it's time to go

Now I'm feeling so far away
I see the colors and all the kids going home
Night is crawling into the day
I hear my voice ringing
The summertime's singing

Just want to stay up all night with you
Just want to stay up all night with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do
Just want to stay up all night with you

I'll keep it moving
Don't wait for nothing now
I gotta keep it moving
Don't wait for nothing now
I'll keep it moving
Don't wait for nothing now
I gotta keep it moving
Don't wait for nothing now

1,2, what you doing?
I've been jumping through some hoops
Want to get my body loose
Want to tell you, tell you what to do
I've been running on the grass like an animal struggling
Looking for a diamond
I'm trying, I'm fighting
Back into the rhythm now

I just want to stay up
I just want to stay up all night with you
With you, with you

Just want to stay up all night with you
Just want to stay up all night with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do
Just want to stay up all night with you

Hands up in the air
If you don't really care
Living on [?] there
If you got the climb to take it up there

Hands up in the air
Living out on a prayer
Never know that you're there
Nothing that I want but rather be there
