It's that time of the season
When the blood runs hot
And God must have a reason
When the temperature drops
One more nameless baby
And a momma in shame
Not one of the fathers
Of the churches came

For a motherless child in the wild, wild city
It ain't no place for a girl
So young and pretty
A motherless child in the wild, wild city
Cause the city ain't no place for a lonely girl

It could happen to me
It could happen to you
It's the luck of the draw
It's the blow of the dice
There ain't nothin' that you can do
She took too many daddies
Took too many home
Tryna find the one, someone else's son
She couldn't weather those streets alone

For a motherless child in the wild, wild city
It ain't no place for a girl
So young and pretty
A motherless child in the wild, wild city
Cause the city ain't no place for a lonely girl

For a motherless child in the wild, wild city
It ain't no place for a girl
So young and pretty
A motherless child in the wild, wild city
Cause the city ain't no place, no no
The city ain't no place
The city ain't no place for a lonely girl
