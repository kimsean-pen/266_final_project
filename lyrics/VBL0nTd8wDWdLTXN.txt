I can't remember the last time I saw your face
I feel so lonely without the crowded space
You left me without direction

'Cause I've gone from place to place
Trying to bring you back
I've walked for days and days
'Cause I can't face the fact
That nothing is better than you

I'm coming because I need to find you
Is anybody there who can rescue
Somebody like me?
'Cause I'm just waiting
For somebody like you
Somebody like you

Without you I'm a lost boy
Without you I'm a lost boy
Come find me I'm a lost boy
'Cause without you I'm a lost boy(boy, boy, boy)

I can't remember the last time I heard your voice
I've sat in silence living in a world of noice
'Cause you were perfection

'Cause I've been from place to place
Trying to bring you back
I've walked for days and days
'Cause I can't face the fact
That nothing is better than you

I'm coming because I need to find you
Is anybody there who can rescue
Somebody like me?
'Cause I'm just waiting
For somebody like you
Somebody like you

Without you I'm a lost boy
Without you I'm a lost boy
Come find me I'm a lost boy
'Cause without you I'm a lost boy

Come find me
Come find me
Come find me
Come find me
Come find me
(I've been from place to place)
Come find me
Come find me
Come find me
Come find me
Come find me
Come find me
Come find me
Come find me
Come find me

Without you I'm a lost boy
Without you I'm a lost boy
Come find me I'm a lost boy
'Cause without you I'm a lost boy

I'm coming because I need to find you
Is anybody there who can rescue
Somebody like me?
'Cause I'm just waiting
For somebody like you
Somebody like you

'Cause without you I'm a lost boy
Without you I'm a lost boy
Without you I'm a lost boy
Without you I'm a lost boy
