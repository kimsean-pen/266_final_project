Say, we'll run away
When things get better, better than today
Blind leading blind
Never knowing what we find

Where are we going and who are we now?
Let's decide

This time you've got to make up your mind
This life you're living
This time you've got to make up your mind
This life's worth living

Get up, we got our ways to go

We are only getting better
Where we were that doesn't matter
Lately everything is hazy but I know what's true
Lately everyone seems crazy but I believe in you

Sun shines in the eyes
Of those who know how to leave the past behind

This time you've got to make up your mind
This life you're living
This time you've got to make up your mind
This life's worth living

Get up, we got our ways to go

We are only getting better
Where we were that doesn't matter
Lately everything seems hazy but I know what's true
Lately everyone seems crazy but I believe in you

This time you've got to make up your mind
This life's worth living

Get up, we got our ways to go

We are only getting better
Where we were that doesn't matter
Lately everything seems hazy but I know what's true
Lately everyone seems crazy but I believe in you
