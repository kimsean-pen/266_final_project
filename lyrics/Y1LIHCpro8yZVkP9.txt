When we kiss my heart's on fire
Burning with a strange desire
And I know, each time I kiss you (Whoehoe)
That your heart's on fire too

So, my darling, please surrender (Surrender)
All your love so warm and tender (Surrender)
Let me hold you in my arms, dear
While the moon shines bright above

All the stars will tell the story (Ahahaa)
Of our love and all its glory
Let us take this night of magic
And make it a night of love

Won't you please surrender to me (Surrender)
Your lips, your arms, your heart, dear (Surrender)
Be mine forever
Be mine tonight (Ahahaaa)
