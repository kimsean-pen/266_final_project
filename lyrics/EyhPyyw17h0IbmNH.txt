These days it's crucial to be silent and comfortable
The exploitation of humanity that learn to accept it all
In my generation I would never fit in
I should be saint but I want to murder, murder everyone

Babes of the late 80s why are you looking so random?

Without pasture there's no movement
In my pathetic age group there's confusion
Through section to a mental institution
There's a criminal of illusion

You would fantasize about the world's elimination
I didn't agree but now I must say at least you had imagination
People of my age have no attitude
I should give in but I want to murder, murder everyone

Babes of the late 80s why are you looking so random?
Without pasture there's no movement
In my pathetic age group there's confusion
Babes of the late 80s if you could on could from?
How can absence be improvement?
Ooooh well, in my age group there's confusion.
