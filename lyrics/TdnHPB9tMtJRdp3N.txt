Tug on my heart with a cheap little string
Shots at the bar but I know it's a sting
Oh darling, those puppy dog eyes are doing that thing
I try to resist but I don't stand a chance
Wrapped 'round your finger, now I'm ready to dance
Oh darling, the next thing I know is I'm all in your hands

Baby you know how to get to me
(Yeah, we've been here before)
Just look at the state you got me in
(Stop and give me some more)

Uh oh, uh oh, I can't say no
Uh oh, uh oh, I can't say no
Swinging your lasso at my rodeo
You're pulling me in with another low blow

When I wanna leave, you know what song to play
A little heartbeat, my hips start to sway
Oh darling, I hate to admit that you've blown me away

Baby you know how to get to me
(Yeah, we've been here before)
Just look at the state you got me in
(Stop and give me some more)

Uh oh, uh oh, I can't say no
Uh oh, uh oh, I can't say no
Swinging your lasso at my rodeo
You're pulling me in with another low blow

Mmm mmm, now sing with me
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
(O oh oh, oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
(O oh oh, oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
(O oh oh, oh oh oh)
Oh, oh, oh, ah

Uh oh, uh oh, I can't say no
Uh oh, uh oh, I can't say no
Swinging your lasso at my rodeo
You're pulling me in with another low blow
Uh oh, uh oh, I can't say no
Uh oh, uh oh, I can't say no
Swinging your lasso at my rodeo
You're pulling me in with another low blow
