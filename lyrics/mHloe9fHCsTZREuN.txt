So what if I was just a painter
Painting houses on the rich blue coast
Would you ever try to leave me
For somebody who deserves you most
'Cause darling I am just a painter
I'm painting houses for the rich old folks

I'm gonna make a million dollars
'Cause nobody's gonna steal you, no
For diamonds & gold
For diamonds & gold
I've broken bones for you

& for you only
I make money, but we just can't keep this home
Give me your heart & your hand, & we can run
We can run, we can run, baby, run now
We can run, baby, run

She's like a bullet through an ocean
I still remember how you moved so slow
You tried to kill me with a shotgun
Bang, now we're even
We don't stop 'til someone's bleeding

We don't stop 'til someone's bleeding
I've broken bones for you
& for you only
I make money, but we just can't keep this home
Give me your heart & your hand, & we can run
We can run, we can run, baby, run now
We can run, baby, run, you're my hope
Permanately yours
Sometimes the moon looks brighter then the sun
As times like this run up my wrists

She hates all of the guts & blood
Splash around with me
While we move like flames on burning sheets
& your doctor won't stop calling me
Her medication
But baby, no, sometimes things don't work out the way we planned
To live is just to fall asleep
To die is to awaken
Maybe we're meant to lose the ones we love
But I'll fight for you 'til then
& if they stole you from you me, on my arm
There's a tattoo of your name
I've broken bones for you
& for you only
I make money, but fuck money
We want love
Give me your heart & your hand
& we can run
