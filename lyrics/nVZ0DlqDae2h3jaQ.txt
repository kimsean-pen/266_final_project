A turning tide
Lovers at a great divide
Why do you laugh?
When I know that you hurt inside?

And why do you say?
It's just another day
Nothing in my way
I don't want to go
I don't want to stay
So there's nothing left to say

And why do you lie?
When you want to die
When you hurt inside
Don't know what you lie for anyway
Now there's nothing left to say

A tell-tale sign
You don't know where to draw the line

And why do you say?
It's just another day
Nothing in my way
I don't want to go
I don't want to stay
So there's nothing left to say

And why do you lie?
When you want to die
When you hurt inside
Don't know what you lie for anyway
Now there's nothing left to say

Well for a lonely soul you're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul you're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul it seems to me
That you're having such a nice time
You're having such a nice time

For a lonely soul you're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul you're having such a nice time
For a lonely soul it seems to me
That you're having such a nice time
You're having such a nice time
