Letra De Dressed For Friend Requests
See through the wreckage
Into the fire inside my heart
Bullet to the head soon you'll be sleeping
Pull this trigger to you antidote

She's Dressed To Kill
I don't know what to wear
She's Dressed To Kill

She had the eyes of angel with a heart like a traitor
And a gun with a trigger in her hand pointed at her
We always knew you'd go up in flames
we always knew you'd go out with a band

We're goin' nowhere fast
We're goin' nowhere fast
