My own mind got me fallin' off the deep end
Seepin' in the crevice it's not much [?] creepin'
If you tryna stay alive
Don't bother voices been speaking
'Cause the reapers tear you face until your blood is leaking
On the pavement I've been laying low
I'd rather lay alone
I'd rather sit and contemplate my fade and fuckin' zone
Wear a mask and cut my wrist until I feel the flow
I wanna kill myself so bad and you don't even know
Never cared about the money or the fame
'Cause the money fill my tummy but my pockets stay the same
I've been slowly craving happiness and I should be ashamed
I ain't let myself feel anything, these thoughts are all to blame
Yeah, and I'm probably fucking up by speaking out about my life
But I'm sick of hiding in the dark just gripping at the knife
And all the chances to erase and put an end to all the strife
And if you ask if I'm okay I'll prolly tell you I'm alright, yuh
Can't breathe unless there's doja in my lungs
I ain't makin' sense, it's like my mind's speakin' in tongues
Concious but my spliff is burning, murder with these guns, Violence
Ain't gonna stop this shit I think I'm fucking done, yeah
