Baby, Darling, Doll Face, Honey
No I don't mean to cause you worry
It's only hands in my pocket
And the Queen on my money

Did you know I've been wanting you?
So leave your locks on the latches
If you bring the water
I'll bring the matches

'Cause we are fires in the night
We are fires in the night
Let us bathe you in our heart
'Cause we are fires in the night

Come on get up, Romeo
Don't you know what the time is?
It's the fall of rock 'n roll
That's what the news said

Did you know I've been wanting you?
So leave your locks on the latches
If you bring the water
I'll bring the matches

'Cause we are fires in the night
We are fires in the night
Let us bathe you in our heart
'Cause we are fires in the night

We are fires in the night
We are fires in the night
Let us bathe you in our light
We are fires in the night
