Showed up, shot down same day
Deep breaths, short steps same way
Your house I know it's okay
I left but I wish I had...
Stayed up, slowed down, it's too late
I still have more to say
How much could my words weigh
I left but I wish I had stayed
The night, the night, the night, the night

A little bit broken, I'm not the only one
A little bit desperate, I'm not the only one
I've got a feeling that you feel the same
We've got a sickness and we know its name
A little bit broken, I'm not the only one

Old glass still sees same face
Bad blood, deep cuts, same place
I just wanna be okay
You left but I wish you had stayed here
I can't see straight
I need to hear you say
We caused this hurricane
We're gone but I wish we had stayed
The night, the night, the night, the night

A little bit broken, I'm not the only one
A little bit desperate, I'm not the only one
I've got a feeling that you feel the same
We've got a sickness and we know its name
A little bit broken, I'm not the only one

I couldn't go home right away
I didn't want to see anybody I knew
I just wanted to be a ghost
Completely anonymous

And in this moment, I need the past
You burnt the bridge, I built a home in the ashes
Why should I forgive you?
It's been a long night, I've had enough
I made my bed in the dirt and the dust
Swear I never meant to stay
The night, the night, the night, the night

A little bit broken, I'm not the only one
A little bit desperate, I'm not the only one
I've got a feeling that you feel the same
We've got a sickness and we know its name
A little bit broken, I'm not the only one

I'm broken
But I'm not the only one
