Don't let life consume you
It could eat you up inside
Can you see the human spirit?
Tell me why should I have to hide?

And with my heart in my hand
And with my hand upon my heart
And with my heart in my hand
It's not like we planned

Don't betray your lover
You will just betray yourself
Can you see the human spirit?
Is there emptiness inside?

And with my heart in my hand
And with my hand upon my heart
And with my heart in my hand
It's not like we planned

Can you see the human spirit?
Is there emptiness inside?
Can you see the human spirit?
Is there loneliness inside?

And with my heart in my hand
And with my hand upon my heart
And with my heart in my hand
It's not like we planned
