I heard you got a car and you're gonna go far
You probably should get out but there's not much going on
A man as smart as you could be set to be a star
You're a star amongst a few but we wonder who you are
You shoot them to the floor with a whistle and a laugh
They'll never get your jokes 'cos you're smarter than they are
You spend your time online being somewhat of a star
You're a star amongst a few and we wonder who you are
People call you mean 'cos you tease them with the truth
Twisted for a laugh by a wit as sharp as you
Wasting all your time playing farces with the few
You could be something great
But something great is nothing new
