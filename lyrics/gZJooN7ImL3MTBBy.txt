War cries pierces the autumn mist
Gunfire penetrate front lines
Panzers storming as an iron fist
Gunfire penetrate front lines

Steel and fire collide with a crash
Panzers plunge into the front
Crushing the bodies of the foes with a splash
Panzers plunge into the front

Scorched earth
The soil soaked with blood
On the ground nothing more can burn
Scorched earth
The absence of god
A mistake the enemy will learn

Blowtorch battalion burning the flank
As fanatics the foes the attack
The thousand soldiers with battle tanks
As fanatics the foes they attack

Through the Losheim pass striving on to the west
They seal their fate and their souls
Leaving their prisoners in eternal rest
They seal their fate and their souls

Attacking - the holy cause must be fulfilled
No mercy - take pride in the thrill of the kill
Omens - the horoscope of time shows war
Victory - forevermore

Indefatigable battalions of storm
Destined to kill and be killed
Spearheads which rolling relentless they form
Destined to kill and be killed

The griffin protects us with beak and with claws
No enemy can bring forth our death
We must win to save us forth our death
We must win to save us from the plagues grasping jaws
No enemy can bring forth our death

Scorched earth
The soil soaked with blood
On the ground we draw our last breath
Scorched earth
We meet our god
But our banner is greater than death

Scorched earth - two hundred thousand men have died
Scorched earth - tunnel of light in high tide
Scorched earth - nothing new in history
Scorched earth - massive death for our glory
