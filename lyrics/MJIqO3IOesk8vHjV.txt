You just got knocked the fuck out
The punishment fits the crime
So keep your hand held high and you'll find out why
That this raised fist ain't afraid to fly
You just got knocked the fuck out
The punishment fits the crime
So keep your hand held high and you'll find out why
That this raised fist, it ain't afraid to fly

77 since the 88
Had to look at my phone 'cause I couldn't believe the date
It's 2017 but in a 40's trend
With a racist president that's "making everything great again"
But tell me when that this was fucking okay
All the streets and the screens popping triple K's
You want the peace? Uh-uh, nah, that won't fly here
'Cause if you blink they're pushing you back 300 years
Call it what you want but it's an eye for an eye
I'll mark you with a down right down - right up right
They're trying to censor that they're the fucking oppressor
And all you say is that it's wrong when they're swinging at Spencer?
Brand yourself like a bull when it sees red
Make the lie big, that's what he said
Fuck him and fuck you too, and appreciate
That if you preach hate, then expect hate

You just got knocked the fuck out
The punishment fits the crime
Keep your hand held high and you'll find out why
That this raised fist ain't afraid to fly
Yeah, you just got knocked the fuck out
The punishment fits the crime
So keep your hand held high and you'll find out why
That this raised fist, it ain't afraid to fly

Lowest of the low, rats out of their holes
We never used to let these dickheads have any control
Speech is "free" but it comes with a price
And if you're speaking out some bullshit, I'll give you advice
Hit 'em with a left a left and a right
Got 'em dropping like flies with the stars in their eyes
Yeah, so fuck them and fuck you too and appreciate
That if you preach hate, then expect hate

You just got knocked the fuck out
The punishment fits the crime
Keep your hand held high and you'll find out why
That this raised fist ain't afraid to fly
Yeah, you just got knocked the fuck out
The punishment fits the crime
So keep your hand held high and you'll find out why
That this raised fist, it ain't afraid to fly

What makes you think that this is okay?
What makes you think you're the superior race?
What makes you think that this is alright?
Goodnight alt-right
If you preach hate, then expect hate
If you preach hate, then expect hate
Nazi punks fuck off
Well, now you've heard it from me and the Dead Kennedys
Nazi punks fuck off
Nazi punks fuck off
