It's an hour past midnight
And you're driving 'round the block
We'll be chasing our heartaches
And you needed to be safe to know

And so whatever you'll do with it
You'll come back even stronger
You've got the power, so use it
Don't wait any longer

Then you turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
Do you really think you want to play this game?
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
When you think it will be safe it will go away
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
You still control the fire within my heart
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
Well, the night is young
This is where we start, this is where we start

Now we thought we could be lovers
It was as easy as can be
On that night we would discover
All the tears flooding the streets. But I know

I know you're planning to roll with it
You'll come back even stronger
You've got the power, so use it
Don't wait any longer

Then you turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
Do you really think you want to play this game?
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
When you think it will be safe it will go away
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
You still control the fire within my heart
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
Well, the night is young
This is where we start

Lights out, Not a single angel on the interstate tonight
Hold on, I can't shake the feeling that we'll never get it right
This time, Seeing is believing and I'm holding on for life
You know, You're all I ever wanted but I just can't win this fight
As you turn, turn, turn

Then you turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
Do you really think you want to play this game?
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
When you think it will be safe it will go away
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
You still control the fire within my heart
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
Well, the night is young
This is where we start
