You beloved...
Were to me everything love stood for...
To love one another for awhile was enough
It was all that I lived for...

How can I go on without you
Can I go on without you.
I tell myself this time
I'm gonna have to move on

It's like Bombay sapphires
Hey, I can take you higher
Whatever you desire
I can mend your heart

It is green
It is aquamarine
It is colors I have never seen
I can see past you
To the white sand

It is blue
It is not about you
It is all true
You know who I am

The sea never changes not really
It is the constant in my life
I always return here
To the flash of those colors
Through every window
Wind through the night

Here I am dramatic
Here I am not waiting
Here I am not listening
To the call of the wild

It's like Bombay sapphires
Hey, I can take you higher
Whatever you desire
I can mend your heart

It's like purple haze
It's there every day
It's passion never fades
You know what I mean

It's like Bombay sapphires
Hey, I can take you higher
Whatever you desire
I can mend your heart

I can mend your heart
I can mend your heart
I can mend your heart

Whatever you desire
