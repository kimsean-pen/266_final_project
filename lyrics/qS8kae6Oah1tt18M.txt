Ten years ago on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall lights
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

She walks these hills, in a long black veil
She visits my grave, when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows, but me

The Judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
For i'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

Now the scaffold is high, and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd, and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night, when the cold wind moan
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

She walks these hills, in a long black veil
She visits my grave, when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows, but me
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows, but me
