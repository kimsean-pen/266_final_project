- PART I: LO SPIRITO DELLA FORESTA

King Uriel
The horns of war were sounding
On icy winds the echoes of ancient fears will breathe again
Soon on the edge of the Northlands
The future of our world would be decided

Nel timido soffio del vento
Al nuovo sorriso del sol
Si scopre la valle dorata
Incanto d'anima e cor

Sentiero ce ormai ti nascondi
Rivela la via che fu
Tra quercia, castano ed abete
Al nostro passo silente

Odori sfumati nel senso
Colori ormai senza eta'
Tra resine ed erbe inebrianti
Tra ombra e verita'

Leggiadra visione di sogno
E di parallela realta'
Transcendi l'umana coscienza
Pacando il mio fiero ardore

OR SPLENDE IN ME LA TUA LUCE
NEL SUO RIFLESSO PACE ED AMOR
IL VERDE INTIMO MANTO
E DELLA ROCCIA IL GRIGIO PUDOR
INCANTO E PURA ENERGIA
RICOLMA D'ANTICA SAGGEZZA

IO CANTO LA TUA MERAVIGLIA
DIVINA E MISTICA ESSENZA
INCANTO E VERA MAGIA
TRA NEVE, RUGIADA E TEMPESTA
NEL SOGNO, MITO E LEGGENDA
LO SPIRITO DELLA FORESTA

Ti amo o madre natura
O vita che data mi fu
Or splendi scintilla infinita
Tra il verde, il grigio ed il blu

Vi amo creature dei boschi
Pulsanti di vita e ancor piu'
Custodi d'astrali pensieri
Che a noi si celano arcani

OR SPLENDE IN ME LA TUA LUCE
NEL SUO RIFLESSO PACE ED AMOR
IL VERDE INTIMO MANTO
E DELLA ROCCIA IL GRIGIO PUDOR
INCANTO E PURA ENERGIA
RICOLMA D'ANTICA SAGGEZZA

IO CANTO LA TUA MERAVIGLIA
DIVINA E MISTICA ESSENZA
INCANTO E VERA MAGIA
TRA NEVE, RUGIADA E TEMPESTA
NEL SOGNO, MITO E LEGGENDA
LO SPIRITO DELLA FORESTA

- PART II: REALM OF SACRED WATERFALLS

Warriors and dragons from the middle lands
Knights from the Western far rocky plains
Elves from the wide majestic green lakes
Bravehearts from the South and the icy North

The astral alignment will show all its might
Be ready to get the stars' holy sign
They'll show us all one true face of the sin
The century's last... last great eclipse

March from the corners of the Earth
(March for the Earth... all march)
For the fate of your world

In this day of doom and blazing rage
Of clashing titans, anger, hate
May the hells collapse again

Acqua ch'or scendi
Or ruvida or stanca
Nel quieto singhiozzo
Tu scavi la roccia

Or lava la mano
Di quel mezzo uomo
Che 'si trasparente
Ti ruba al suo pianto

IN BETWEEN AMAZING LAKES
AND BREATHTAKING WATERFALLS
VALIANT HEROES FOUND THEIR FATE
RODE AND FACED THE BLACK STORM

IN THE FURY OF THE WIND
AT THE HARDEST CLASH OF STEEL
VALIANT HEROES RAISED THEIR SWORD
FOR THE SAKE OF THE WORLD

ERIAS, THARIN, ARDUN, MORLA

Mighty Earthquake, invincible thunder
Now unleash your utmost power
Lift the wings, the wings of our angels
In this new and horrific war

Send the North wind to freeze
Any fear in our hearts
Finally allied for an angel who spoke
Against the unborn

March from the corners of the Earth
(March for the Earth... all march)
For the fate of your world

In this day of doom and blazing rage
Of clashing titans, anger, hate
May the hells collapse again

Acqua ch'or scendi
Or ruvida or stanca
Nel quieto singhiozzo
Tu scavi la roccia

Or lava la mano
Di quel mezzo uomo
Che 'si trasparente
Ti ruba al suo pianto

IN BETWEEN AMAZING LAKES
AND BREATHTAKING WATERFALLS
VALIANT HEROES FOUND THEIR FATE
RODE AND FACED THE BLACK STORM

IN THE FURY OF THE WIND
AT THE HARDEST CLASH OF STEEL
VALIANT HEROES RAISED THEIR SWORD
FOR THE SAKE OF THE WORLD

- PART III: THANOR'S AWAKENING

King Uriel
The news of victory spread like lightning across the land
This battle ended with the army of darkness in total defeat
Their unholy blood spread across the snow
And dried black in the glorious sun of the Northlands

Solo

The moment has come
We must hurry!

Take the eyes

Alright
Aelin fits perfectly on the left
And Mornir on the other side

The angels will speak

These vibrations

As I said it is the time of the angels
No... no my brothers! Look at the statue
Look at Thanor... look!

The spirit of Thanor rose from the abyss
Where Nekron tortured his body and soul
After his betrayal in the last of the primordial wars
When the spirt reached the statue, the Earth quaked

- PART IV: NORTHERN SKIES ENFLAMED

Fly... fly mighty Thanor
For your revenge and our freedom!

A prophecy trapped between icy winds
The words of an angel now cleary revealed
The day of the last terrific eclipse

Spit of the abyss, dark slaves of the beast
Who creep in the shade of bleeding dark worlds
Face us if you dare, we challenge you all

Epic clash of immortals
Demons, angels and men
Fire raining from Heaven
Chaos storming from hell

A dragon condemned to abandon his world
Could open his eyes, awake and reborn
Led by the angels he could finally rise
Enflaming the air of the Northern skies

A battle too hard to be faced by a man
A fight for who owns the magic of Earth
A sacrifice needed to stop a new hell
A mystical weapon, the forbidden spell

Gods of light, angels of the highest cosmic spheres
My friend Etherus, master wizard of the White Dragon's Order
Thanks to him Koras, the mightiest of the seven demons, was defeated
Gave his life for the beloved lands
Thanor returned victorious after destroying the six other winged demons
In the darkness of the eclipse
Guided by the divine light of angels he killed them all
One by one, foiling Nekron's dark plans
And for what would be the last time he entered the main hall
And magically returned to stone

Solo

In between amazing lakes
And breathtaking waterfalls
Valiant heroes found their fate
Rode and faced the black storm

In the fury of the wind
At the hardest clash of steel
Valiant heroes raised their sword
For the sake of the world

IN BETWEEN AMAZING LAKES
AND BREATHTAKING WATERFALLS
VALIANT HEROES FOUND THEIR FATE
RODE AND FACED THE BLACK STORM

IN THE FURY OF THE WIND
AT THE HARDEST CLASH OF STEEL
VALIANT HEROES RAISED THEIR SWORD
FOR THE SAKE OF THE WORLD

FOR THE SAKE OF THE WORLD

- PART V: THE SPLENDOUR OF ANGELS' GLORY
(A FINAL REVELATION)

Thanor opened his eyes once again
Aelin and Mornir were brighter than ever
He stared at Dargor
Still not finished

No, no
Why me? Why?

It is the decision of the gods and the angels

But I am half demon
There is evil blood pounding in my heart
You know it!

That is the reason why
You have met darkness and light... and you chose
You are the most powerful of us all
The elected... the chosen one

So... so be it
I accept my fate

King Uriel
Dargor's destiny was finally clear
His death was only physical
But from the rest of the shadowlord's body
A new form of life was born

Erian's angelic spirit now embraced Dargor's immortal soul
Combining the supreme energies of the cosmos
To become pure divinity
A god of cosmic light
Did breathe on the Earth... again
