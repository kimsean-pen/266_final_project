I'm so tired of fighting
I'm so tired of being wrong
I hate to see you crying
I wish that I could right
My wrongs
And make it about us, again
Me and that girl ain't
Nothing more than friends
Tonight I'm gonna make
You forget all about her
Tonight I'm gonna make
You forget all about her

That night between us,
It keeps me up
I can't stop thinking about it, oh
I tell her nothing's wrong,
This can't go wrong
I'm done with all this
Sneaking around
I can't wait

I'm so tired of hiding
I know you're tired of
Sleeping alone
You always think I'm right
I say I'm working hard to
Never come home
And make it about us again
Me and that girl ain't nothing
More than friends
Tonight I'm gonna make
You forget all about her
Tonight I'm gonna make
You forget all about her

That night between us,
It keeps me up
I can't stop thinking
About it, oh
I tell her nothing's wrong,
This can't go wrong
I'm done with all this
Sneaking around
I can't wait

That night between us,
It keeps me up
I can't stop thinking about it, oh
I tell her nothing's wrong,
This can't go wrong
I'm done with all this
Sneaking around
I can't wait

Don't wait 'til tomorrow
I can't wait 'til tomorrow
(I don't know why)
Don't wait 'til tomorrow
I can't wait 'til tomorrow
(I don't know why)
I can't wait

I'm so tired of fighting
I'm so tired of being wrong
I hate to see you crying
There's no way
I can't right my wrongs
And make it about us again
Me and that girl always
Been more than friends
Tonight this gonna make
You forget all about me
Forget all about me
