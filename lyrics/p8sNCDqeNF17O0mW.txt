Everyone has their obsession
Consuming thoughts, consuming time
They hold high their prized possession
That defines the meaning of their lives

You are mine
You are mine
You are mine, all mine
You are mine

You are mine
You are mine
You are mine, all mine
You are mine

There are objects of affection
That can mesmerize the soul
There is always one addiction
That just cannot be controlled

You are mine
You are mine
You are mine, all mine
You are mine

You are mine
You are mine
You are mine, all mine
You are mine

You are mine
You are mine
You are mine, all mine
You are mine

You are mine
You are mine
You are mine, all mine
You are mine

You are mine
You are mine
You are mine
You are mine
Everyone has their obsession
Consuming thoughts, consuming time
They hold high their prized possession
That defines the meaning of their lives
You are mine
You are mine
You are mine, all mine
You are mine
You are mine
You are mine
You are mine, all mine
You are mine
