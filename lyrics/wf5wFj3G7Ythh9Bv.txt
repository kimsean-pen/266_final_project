Forgive me for running off to find the one thing I have to do.
Each night you can fall asleep assured that someday I'll be coming home to you.
These constant reminders in everything I see.
The chance of a lifetime... what a great place to be.

Oh Amy, don't hate me, for running away from you.
Oh Amy, don't hate me. I'm still in love with you!

I'm sorry I can't be everything to you.
Your place is at the heart of what I do.
Everything's for you.

Oh Amy, don't hate me, for running away from you.
Oh Amy, don't hate me. I'm still in love with you!
Oh Amy, Oh Amy!
Oh Amy, Oh Amy!
Oh Amy, don't hate me. I'm still in love with you!

Every time I run away, it's easier to stay.
At the heart, the heart is you in everything I do.
Every time I run away, it's easier to stay.
At the heart, the heart is you in everything I do.
