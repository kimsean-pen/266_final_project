Ever since I met you girl, you been on my brain
I can't think of nothing else but you all night and day
It's like I got a first class seat up on Ozzy's train
It's driving me insane

5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I'm goin' crazy, thinkin' 'bout you baby
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco
I'm goin' crazy, think I love you baby

I gotta get your number girl, I gotta call you up
I gotta get you ridin' shotgun in my truck
This little bit of you I've got, it ain't good enough
Yeah, you got me all messed up

5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I'm goin' crazy, thinkin' 'bout you baby
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco
I'm goin' crazy, think I love you baby

Cause I, ain't never felt like this, no
And I, I just need one kiss, from you
And I'll be good as new
If I don't get some of your sweet lovin' no tellin' what I might do

5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
Think I'm losin' my mind, girl
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I'm goin' crazy, thinkin' 'bout you baby
5-1-5-0, spinnin' my head like a yo-yo
I'm goin' crazy, think I love you baby
