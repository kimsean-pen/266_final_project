94 hours of regret
For me to realize what I held
Unfading beauty, not just a face
I held its innocence within my heart
Go!

Now I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
(Now I...) I won't let go
(Now I...) I won't let go

The torment of your eyes
Has awakened my soul

The torment of your eyes
Has awakened my soul
The pain of a moment's time
Will forever beg your forgiveness
Forgiveness

94 hours
For me to realize
I held the unfading beauty
I held your innocence
