I forget about my friends
But they come 'round and ask me where the fuck I've been
And all I say is, Desperate times come with special treasures
Now it's hard to not think about it
To not think about it
To not think about it, about it

Tell me how you feel
Tell me how you feel
Do you take it seriously?
Tell me how to feel
Tell me how to feel
Should I take it seriously?
I found myself dropping everything for you
Nobody else matters as much as you do

So don't make me a fool
So don't make me a fool
So don't make me a fool
So don't make me a fool

Why do we confuse ourselves
I'm so done with always feeling like this, like this, like this
But special ones call for desperate measures
Now it's hard to not live without it
To not live without it
To not live without it, without it
Without it

Tell me how you feel
Tell me how you feel
Do you take it seriously?
Tell me how to feel
Tell me how to feel
Should I take it seriously?
I found myself dropping everything for you
Nobody else matters as much as you do

So don't make me a fool
So don't make me a fool
So don't make me a fool
So don't make me a fool

String me along, tie me down
Shame on you
But if I come back around, shame on me

Tell me how you feel
Tell me how you feel
Do you take it seriously?
Tell me how to feel
Tell me how to feel
Should I take it seriously?
I found myself dropping everything for you
Nobody else matters as much as you do

So don't make me a fool
So don't make me a fool
So don't make me a fool
So don't make me a fool
