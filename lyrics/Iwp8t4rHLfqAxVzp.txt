Am I a stranger in the dark?
Or am I someone you can trust indeed?
Am I following too close?
Or am I right where I'm supposed to be?
Am I a million miles away?
Or am I so close I can almost reach?
Did I do it to myself?
Or did I really mean what I believe?

All I ever wanted was the blinding
Because all I ever saw was just the name
And all I've ever wanted was to find it
It's time, I finally know just what it means

To go off the rails
To go off the rails
To go off the rails
To go off the rails

Am I the fire, or the spark?
Or am I here to be the room You heat?
Am I everything You hoped?
Or was my channel way too hard to reach?
Is it more than I can take?
Or is it everything I'll ever need?
What if I don't know what to say?
What if I'm not who I'm supposed to be?

All I ever wanted was the blinding
Because all I ever saw was just the name
And all I've ever wanted was to find it
It's time, I finally know just what it means

To go off the rails
To go off the rails
To go off the rails
To go off the rails

To go off the rails
To go off the rails
To go off the rails
To go off the rails
