It will come right back to you

I will come right back to you
Come right back
Come right back to you

No one sees what it's like
You and me, you and I
Never go, never hide
You and me, you and I

If you let my soul out

You let my soul out
It will come right back to you

If you let my soul out
You let my soul out
You let my soul out
It will come right back to you

If you let my soul out
You let my soul out
You let my soul out
It will come right back to you

If you...
