Let's go!
The prophet speaks his language, reeks,
A vile dogma that schemes and sneaks,
His blood is weak, he's an oil sheik,
Information leak, operation tweek

There's no security in the battlefield,
Metal cannons shape the human shields,
A brand new country, they're gonna build,
One more riot thats selfwilled

State out of control!
It's out of control!
State out of control!
We're outta control, we're outta control,
We're outta control, we're outta control!

Inject the poison into the bloodstream
Pick up your shovel, do what you're told,
The probe is out,
The watchdog grows to incredicble lengths to incredible lows

Well off your target now you have missed,
Deliberate lying and recklessness,
Don't get crushed in the iron fist,
Resist, resist, resist, resist!

State out of control!
It's out of control!
State out of control!
We're outta control, we're outta control,
We're outta control, we're outta control!
Control!
