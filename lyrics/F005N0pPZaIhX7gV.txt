Office trip on saturday night
Must you turn off all the lights
And they spin a web unseen
The dark is quiet a scream
Unaware's the people sleeping
Languid on the bedroom ceiling
Flip my cuff and wipe my feet
On your faces while you sleep
Woo
Sticking blood upon my sleeve
In the darkness underneath
Look up here at high above you
Look to sleep and drop my cub
All you love I shall infringe
Down my web I drop right in
Underneath the human skin i'm
Drilling holes and lingering
Woo
Office trip on saturday night
Must you turn off all the lights
And they spin a web unseen
The dark is quiet a scream
Unaware's the people sleeping
Languid on the bedroom ceiling
Flip my cuff and wipe my feet
On your faces while you sleep
Woo
