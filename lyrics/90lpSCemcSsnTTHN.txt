Needles were stabbed in to the walls
The executioner's curtain call
Fighting back he found his life drowning
And there was no way out
Cause Richard hung himself, Richard hung himself
It happened just the other day
Jesus come and pushed him off the shelf
He thought he'd find a better way than
Stealing and slamming and maiming and ramming
The death who wears black curtains wears clothes what's right
The roof kicked out the rope tied to the rafters
A quick kick of the chair and it was all through
If Richie only knew

Cause Richard hung himself, Richard hung himself
It happened just the other day
Jesus come and push him off the shelf
He thought he found a better way

His life suddenly flashed!
Right before his eyes
What a swingin' guy
Turnin' grey with mold, yuck
This is how he died
Give it up, give it up, throw it all away

Boiling acid bath
Pulmonary wrath
Feel the pulling surge
It won't let you go

Throw it all away, throw it all away, throw it all a. throw it all a. Throw it all away

Swingin' in his room Richard won't come out to play
Cause Richie hung himself the other day
Oh how the world seems to fly by
His death the final high?

Cause Richard hung himself, Richard hung himself
It happened just the other day
Jesus come and push him off the shelf
He thought he found a better way by
Stealing and tearing and ripping and slamming and tripping and scoring and
Laughing and laughing and screaming and hurting and tearing and being and
Taking the body goodbye to you Richard
I gotta get out
What do I do? Die
Richard hung himself... cause Richard... swung himself... Richie hung himself.
