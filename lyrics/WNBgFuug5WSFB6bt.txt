Such a waste I'm waiting out in this space
Such a waste I'm waiting out in this
Such a waste I'm waiting out in this place
Such a waste I'm waiting out in this
Ohhhh... you're waiting in my mind
Ohhhh your face is all I'll find
Oh, on my way
Such a waste I'm waiting out this time
Such a waste I'm feeling all of this now
So many ways to turn this all around
So many ways to make those hidden things found
There's something in the air
We're going through them changes
We're going through them changes babe...
You're going through them changes babe...
We're going through some changes
Hold my heart
It doesn't have a season especially not a fall
I'm giving you my all, mm
It doesn't need a reason to make sense at all
I'm giving you my all
Oh, my love cave into this space
Oh, my love cave into this space
Oh, my love cave into this space
Oh, my love cave into this...
