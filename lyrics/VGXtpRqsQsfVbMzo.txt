I wanna live in dreamland
Just like a star I shine bright for you
Where I can rest in his hands
And keep in staying hearts with him
He takes the time in highlands
Caress behind a pipe in for you
And watch the falling stars that
Feeling in this weakness and thrill
I am the hottest old fire reach out
I am not burning like lighting you up
I am not having all your scars
All the dreams until world will be house
I've been waiting for you
I keep looking for you
I've been waiting for you
I keep looking for you
My shining world will try you
And then you keep the darkness from light
And all the things that you do
I'll stand by you and be by your side
You made me dreams that aren't true
I picture you in this bed so right
No other people like you
Can feel me or hold me so tight
I am the hottest old fire reach out
I am not burning like lighting you up
I am not having down your scars
All the dreams until world will be house
I've been waiting for you
I keep looking for you
I've been waiting for you
I keep looking for you
I keep looking for you
I keep looking for you
