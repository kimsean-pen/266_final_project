Would you open the door
Son I know the way
Soon the flickering light
Will grow
Leave it to me now
Unchained
Unchained

Would you open the door
Enter the here and now
A new horizon
You'll rise you'll fall
And learn to live
Keep the faith - keep the pace

Your soul's like water but
Your fate is like the wind

Here's the new order
Hope shall be your guide
Praise the new order
Now let my spirit go

Do you remember
When we were moon knights?
We've slain the dragon
In the room
Now yours is the future
Your quest for the truth
How will it end up
I really do not know

This is no wonderland
Just keep in mind
Like a spell in certain books
Time will change it all

Away
oh please embrace me
Away
I will be gone
I'll take a look to see
What lies beyond
The break of dawn
Would you open the door
There is so much more to say

Keep the faith
Keep the pace
The soul's like water but
Your fate is like the wind

Here's the new order
Hope shall be your guide
Praise the new order
Now let my spirit go

Will you remember the old rule?
Will you fulfill this sacrifice?
Done for the future
Space for the new
How will it end up?
That's up to you

You're on the bridge
On the borderline
No matter how
You'll never ever leave it

Here's the new order
Hope shall be your guide
Praise the new order
Now let my spirit go

Times will change

The soul's like water and
Like rain it will return

Live on in healing rain

The past shall find release
