It's a magic night
Cause you know I'm with her
We keep sleeping alright
Yeah I better not stare
Night drive
Night drive
Your eyes are giving me life
I can go sleep with the tide
I've got no more drinks
And I got no more lies
Night Drive
Night Drive
Night Drive
Night Drive
Someone sleep with the tide
I say they're good for a ride
City woman talk about her
But you better not cry
Too afraid to move
You can not give me a chance
You say let's go for a ride
I say I want romance
Night Drive
Night Drive
Night Drive
Night Drive
