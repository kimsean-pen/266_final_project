It stands out on a highway
Like a Creature from another time.
It inspires the babies' questions,
"What's that?"
For their mothers as they ride.
But no one stopped to think about the babies
Or how they would survive,
And we almost lost Detroit
This time.
How would we ever get over
Loosing our minds?
Just thirty miles from Detroit
Stands a giant power station.
It ticks each night as the city sleeps
Seconds from anniahlation.
But no one stopped to think about the people
Or how they would survive,
And we almost lost Detroit
This time.
How would we ever get over
Over loosing our minds?
The sherrif of Monroe county had,
Sure enough disasters on his mind,
And what would karen Silkwood say
If she was still alive?

That when it comes to people's safety
Money wins out every time.
And we almost lost Detroit
This time, this time.
How would we ever get over
Over loosing our minds?
You see, we almost lost Detroit
That time.
Almost lost Detroit
That time.
And how would we ever get over...
Cause odds are,
We gonna loose somewhere, one time.
Odds are
We gonna loose somewhere sometime.
And how would we ever get over
Loosing our minds?
And how would we ever get over
Loosing our minds?
Didn't they, didn't they decide?
Almost lost Detroit
That time.
Damn near totally destroyed,
One time.
Didn't all of the world know?
Say didn't you know?
Didn't all of the world know?
Say didn't you know?
We almost lost detroit...
