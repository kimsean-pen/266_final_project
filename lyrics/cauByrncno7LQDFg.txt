Our voices echo on a quiet night
Silver faces, an unholy cathedral
Moon and sun
A birthing rite in this duality

Embrace the feeling of our human skin intertwining now in ecstasy
Lie in the circle of a few who stain our bodies with their own blood

The blessing is given as the child grows
A family burdened with a line full of evil
Sacrifice
Now you can live to see another day

Embrace the feeling of our human skin intertwining now in ecstasy
Lie in the circle of a few who stain our bodies with their own blood

Embrace the feeling of a soul within
Lie in the circle of a few who stain our bodies with their own blood

Our voices echo on a quiet night
Silver faces, an unholy cathedral
Moon and sun
A birthing rite in this duality

These voices echo so violently
A congregation with a line full of evil
Sacrifice
Now you can live to see another day
