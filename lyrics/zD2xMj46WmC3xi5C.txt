I can feel the memory in my brain
I can feel the cold running through my veins
Like it's been, been this way, all of our life
Looking in the mirror through your eyes
Nothing makes sense, these tears won't dry
I let you down, down and out, never thought twice

But than was then
And this is now
I know I said I never, but I know I let you down
And it feels dead, in this town
So tell me when will you bring love back around
Bring love back around
Love back around

Funny how you never quite realise
That you already have paradise
Til it's gone, all the way, out of your life
Looking in the mirror, don't know myself
Nothing makes sense, this feels like hell
I let you down, down and out, never thought twice

But than was then (that was then)
And this is now (this is now)
I know I said I never, but I know I let you down
And it feels dead, (it feels dead) in this town (in this down)
So tell me when will you bring love back around
Love back around
Bring love, oh love, oh love
Bring love back around, yeah
Back around, (bring love), oh oh
Oh, love love love
Bring love back around, yeah

Who can I touch? (with nobody)
Who can I trust? (with nobody)
Who can I love? (with nobody)
If it ain't you, you, you
Who can I touch? (with nobody)
Who can I trust? (with nobody)
Who can I love? (with nobody)
If it ain't you, you, you

But than was then (was then)
And this is now (this is now)
I know I said I never, but I know I let you down
And it feels dead, (it feels dead) in this town (in this town)
So tell me when will you bring love back around
Back around
Bring love, your love, your love
Bring love back around, yeah
Back around, (bring love), oh oh
Oh, love love love
Bring love back around, yeah
Your love back around
