Through the jungle by the river Styx
I've journed long and far this day
Lurking shadows in the parapets

Darkened city veiled in crimson mist
Entombed in time without decay

Lost in Necropolis, lost in Necropolis

I know now that I am

The light of love shines ever more
In the crypt of Atlantean Kings
I found what I was looking for
Magik Trident of Volusia's Sea
I know it's like living inside a dream
But don't you ever get

Lost in Necropolis, lost in Necropolis
Lost in Necropolis, lost in Necropolis
