There's a notebook on the table
You can take it to the store
So you won't forget the groceries anymore

There's a rifle in the cabinet
That I used to fight a war
But to this day I don't know what I was fighting for
Been fighting for

Will you
Show me love as we get older
And I'm falling at your feet
After 30 years of service
And one to fit our need
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
That our older bones are missing
But our hearts will never need

There's a blanket on the sofa
That I use to keep you warm
When I find you fast asleep at half past four

There's a record we keep turning
That reminds us of our youth
But there's still nothing as beautiful as you

(As we grow colder
Love provide the heat
Older bones are missing
Hearts will never need)

Because your hand
Belongs in my hand
Belongs in your hand
Belongs with...
With me!

(Blanket on the sofa
That I use to keep you warm
There's a record we keep turning
That I used to turn you on)

Will you
Show me love as we get older
And I'm falling at your feet?
After 30 years of service
And one to fit our need.
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
That our older bones are missing
But our hearts will never need.
