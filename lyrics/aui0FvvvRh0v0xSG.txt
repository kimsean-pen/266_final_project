I don't wanna be friends
I wanna spend my love and I wanna waste all my time with ya
Is that cool with ya?
But I don't wanna be friends
I want the highs and lows
Everywhere that you go I'mma come with ya
Is that cool with ya?

I don't wanna be more than friendly
'Cause a friend would never think like I do
About you
And lotta thinking lately
That it's different when I'm hanging with you

Every day's the same
Tryna find a way to your body
Something in the way
I feel like I gotta say this

I don't wanna be friends
I wanna spend my love and I wanna waste all my time with ya
Is that cool with ya?
But I don't wanna be friends
I want the highs and lows
Everywhere that you go I'mma come with ya
Is that cool with ya?

I don't wanna be
Just any
Being anybody ain't good enough
For me

Every day's the same
Tryna find a way to your body
Something in the way
I feel like I gotta say this

I don't wanna be friends
I wanna spend my love and I wanna waste all my time with ya
Is that cool with ya?
But I don't wanna be friends
I want the highs and lows
Everywhere that you go I'mma come with ya
Is that cool with ya?

I don't wanna be friends
I wanna spend my love and I wanna waste all my time with ya
Is that cool with ya?
But I don't wanna be friends
I want the highs and lows
Everywhere that you go I'mma come with ya
Is that cool with ya?
But I don't wanna be friends
