I hustled my ass off, they started to listen
So rappers don't diss me
I creep on the weak and your ass can go missing
So boy who you kidding
Got game like I'm Scotty, I ball and I'm pimping

You crossing the road like a chicken
Her pussy my land and I stick it
Feelin' froggy, nigga ribbit

Eat these rappers, now I'm shitting
Flow numb, can you feel it?
Flow dumb, do you get it?

I awake, play a beat and slay
Get out my space, you could never stay
I be touching down in every state
It was thrown, now watch me break away
Superhero, Imma save the day
I work so hard and I can't take a break
I'm in the nature talking to the rain
They poison the youth, they should be ashamed
Tell these niggas we ain't playing games

We need the animals out the cage
The hair is coming, we gon bring the rage
