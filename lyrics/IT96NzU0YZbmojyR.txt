Crawling back into my shell
I'm running
Thawing through winter to haul me to hell
And I know I should know better
But I am not a thorn for you ever
I'm not a thorn for you ever

Falling back into myself
I'm running
Waiting on someone to reach out again
And I know I should know better
But I am not a thorn for you ever
I'm not a thorn for you ever

And all you wanted was to see for yourself
Hollow-eyed without a low to repeat for myself
How will I hide

So give me something for the shame
I'm running
Holding my colour to see through the pain
Now I know I should know better
But I am not a thorn for you ever
I'm not a thorn for you ever

Just say the word and I'll go, if that's what you're saying

All the years I self-proclaimed
And yet here I still remain
And if all the things I had to say
Are called a million miles away
Will you know the truth before I lift my head?
We began outside the wall
