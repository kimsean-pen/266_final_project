Sometimes I
Need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes I
Need you to stay away from me

Sometimes I'm
In disbelief I didn't know
Somehow I
Need you to go
Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
(Just give me myself back and)

Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you

(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay
Sometimes I
Feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes I
Just feel like screaming at myself
Sometimes I'm
In disbelief I didn't know
Somehow I

Need to be alone
Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities

Take all your faithlessness with you
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay
I don't need you anymore
I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day
Of you wasting me away
I don't need you anymore
I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day
Of you wasting me away
With no apologies
Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay
Don't stay
Don't stay
