We are the insect
We are the insect, breeding
We are the insect
We are the insect, breeding

A fire burns
In the back of the throat
Let it out, let it out
Before the choke

Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence
Dusk dismantled
We are the infinitesimal

Bursting inside out
Bursting from the inside out
Bursting inside out
Bursting from the inside out

I dig a hole
Through what's left of my world
Searching for something more
I turn it inwards

Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence
Dusk dismantled
We are the infinitesimal

I'm falling, I'm falling
In this colossal void
Each day that I spent digging downward
Built me up for a higher fall

Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence
Dusk dismantled
We are the infinitesimal
Dusk dismantled
Dusk dismantled
Dusk dismantled
Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence
