I awake, without the sun
Encased in walls of steel
Terror so real, it blinds me, blinds me
Rancid darkness steals my breath
The pit, on the edge of death
The wells of hell know not my name

I slip away into black I fade away

Terrified, to the left and to the right
Spirits of the damned, iron shadows cast
Hear my desperate cries
Shrieking demon, far and wide
Praying for this breath to be my last

Awake again, paralyzed
I'm shackled to this alter
Sacrificed to their god, their god
Inch by inch and line by line
The blade, descending lost in time
The fiends of doom they call my name

I slip away into black I fade away

Terrified, to the left and to the right
Spirits of the damned, iron shadows cast
Hear my desperate cries
Shrieking demon, far and wide
Praying for this breath to be my last

The Inquisitorial vengeance
Had been hurried by my two-fold escape
And there was to be no more dallying
With the king of terrors

Terrified, to the left and to the right
Spirits of the damned, iron shadows cast
Hear my desperate cries
Shrieking demon, far and wide
Praying for this breath to be my last
