She's got the look
She's so fine
And you know damn well
The girl will be mine

She's got the breaks
She's the scene
And you know damn well
She gives it to me (uh-huh)

Black jeans and
A turtleneck sweater
I know the girl
Is fakin' 'cause
I've seen her look better

She's composition
She's statistical fact
She got it ready for the willing
Got it kicking of the back

(She's got the look)
She's got the look
Wanting no break time
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

She's got the look
Wanting no break time
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

Come to the place
Shock tacy
And you know damn well
You know what I mean

Hot in the face
One to 3
Like a pleasure trip
Like you've never seen (uh-huh)

Satin lace
And a paisley cut top
The girl is wasting over
'cos she knows she looks hot

She's got position
She's got just what it takes
Got a mojo in her pocket
Got it ready just in case

(She's got the look)
She's got the look
Wanting no break time
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

She's got the look
Wanting no break time
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

Please no, keep back
I can't take it
You're driving me wild
I might not make it
You got me looking like buckwheat
(oh) hair pulled
Every which way but neat
Far from medusa
But you looks are deadly
Your walk is soft
Still I hear the medley
Oh, shiver me timberland boots
Cramp my style
She drives me wild

She's got the look
She's got the look

(She's got the look)
She's got the look
Wanting no break time
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

(That girl's my baby)
She's got the look
Wanting no break time
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

(She's got the look)
She's got the look
Wanting no break time
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

(She's got the look)
She's got the look
Wanting no break time
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

(She's got the look)
She's got the look
Wanting no break time
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
