I love the taste of cigarettes
I love the taste of alcohol
Soon I'll give my body a rest
And I'll let my hair grow long
I'm halfway to my bed in the endless corridor
Where I feel the smell of cigarettes
Where I feel the smell of alcohol

You are growing old
She said you are growing old
You are growing old

I love the taste of cigarettes
I love the taste of alcohol
Soon I'll give my body a rest
And I'll let my hair grow long
I don't want to make an effort
But I don't want to be alone
It's in the taste of cigarettes
It's in the taste of alcohol

You are growing old
She said you are growing old
You are growing old

You said that my suit looks better on a hanger
You said that my suit looks better on a hanger

I love the taste of cigarettes
And I love the taste of alcohol
I'll give my body a rest
I'll let my hair grow long
I'm halfway to my bed in the endless corridor
Where I feel the smell of cigarettes
Where I feel the smell of alcohol

You are growing old
She said you are growing old
You are growing old
