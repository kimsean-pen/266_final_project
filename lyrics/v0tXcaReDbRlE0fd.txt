Farewell, my dear last breathe of green
Aranen's flag fights cold icy winds
White River flow, you led our way
Now a new wild path to the fair plain

Skylords arise
Your thunders are quaking my soul
Rage of the Heavens... storm!
In me now it pounds your great force

One more time
We turn back sad but proud
Just silence and grey rock
Towards the last known town

In ages of hate and raging swords
Along these grey plains so wild and cold
The armies of dragons, elves and men
All stormed the dark gates of a thousand hells

And now we'll declare eternal war
To every damned new hellish lord
On the way to Ainor

Dark hells beware
The angels are calling my name
A sacred fate for whom
Was born as half demon, half man

One more time
We turn back sad but proud
Just silence and grey rock
Towards the last known town

In ages of hate and raging swords
Along these grey plains so wild and cold
The armies of dragons, elves and men
All stormed the dark gates of a thousand hells

And now we'll declare eternal war
To every damned new hellish lord
On the way to Ainor

In ages of hate and raging swords
Along these grey plains so wild and cold
The armies of dragons, elves and men
All stormed the dark gates of a thousand hells

And now we'll declare eternal war
To every damned new hellish lord
On the way to Ainor
In ages of hate and raging swords
Along these grey plains so wild and cold
The armies of dragons, elves and men
All stormed the dark gates of a thousand hells
And now we'll declare eternal war
To every damned new hellish lord
On the way to Ainor
