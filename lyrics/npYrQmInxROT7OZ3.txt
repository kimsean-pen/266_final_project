For your pleasure
In our present state
Part false part true
Like anything
We present ourselves.

The words we use tumble
All over your shoulder
Gravel hard and loose.

There all night lying
With your dark horse hiding
Abhorring such extremes.

Your rubbing shoulders
With the stars at night
Shining so bright
Getting older
But you'll wake up soon
And fight
In the morning
Things you worried about
Last night
Will seem lighter
I hope things
Will turn out right.

Old man
Through every step a change
You watch me walk away
Tara tara...
