Picture an imaginary line
Tracing the foundation of the house you never built
Concealing insecurities with casual replies
Disregard the wreckage till it showers you in guilt
And breathe in the debris that you find

I can't take time
If your hands stay tied
I can't take time
If your hands stay

All I saw was street lights in the sky
Off of ninety-five
Hit the powerline
I DON'T WANT TO DIE

My crimes rectified
Penance and contrite
Terrors in the night
For the devil that's inside

I wasn't there for a reason
I wasn't there for a reason
I didn't fucking show up for a reason
I wasn't there for a reason

Picture an imaginary line
Crossing out the narrative you never even wrote
Blank obituaries weighing heavy on your mind
Malice that you buried deep inside of every quote
And burn inside the words that you write

You're irresponsible
You're an obstacle

I could have stopped you though
I was incautious
And I was illogical
Tell me not to go
That was impossible
I was too hostile to you

All I saw was street lights in the sky
Off of ninety-five
Hit the powerline
I DON'T WANNA DIE

I wasn't there for a reason
I wasn't there for a reason
I didn't fucking show up for a reason
I wasn't there for a reason

(All I saw was street lights in the sky)
(Off of ninety-five)
Hit the powerline
I DON'T WANNA DIE

I wasn't there for a reason
I wasn't there for a reason
I didn't fucking show up for a reason
I wasn't there for a reason

I can't take time
I can't take time
If your hands stay tied
