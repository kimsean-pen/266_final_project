Fly little bird to Hiroshima
On the way a load
Speak the magic word to Hiroshima
Let the sky explode

Hiroshima
Hiroshima

There's a shadow of a man at Hiroshima
Where he passed the moon
In a wonderland at Hiroshima
Where he died too soon
And the world remembers his face
Remembers the flame was

Hiroshima

Fly little bird to Hiroshima
On the way a load
Speak the magic word to Hiroshima
Let the sky explode
And the world remembers his name
Remembers the flame was

Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Hiroshima

Hiroshima was the flame
Know his face, we know his name
We're remembering the place was here

Shadow of a man at Hiroshima
Where he passed the moon
In a wonderland at Hiroshima
Where he died too soon
And the world remembers his name
Remembers the flame was

Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Hiroshima

Hiroshima
Hiroshima

Oh, oh ya

Oh... no no no

Oh, no, don't do it

Hiroszima
