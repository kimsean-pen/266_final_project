Honestly, what would become of me
Don't like reality
It's way too clear to me
But really, life is dandy
We are what we don't see
We miss everything daydreaming

Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
Come to an end, come to an
Why do all good things come to an end
Come to an end, come to an
Why do all good things come to an end

Travelling, I only stop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay
Young and restless
Living this way, I stress less
I want to pull away when the dream dies
The pain sets in and I don't cry
I only feel gravity and I wonder why

Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
Come to an end, come to an
Why do all good things come to an end
Come to an end, come to an
Why do all good things come to an end

Well the dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon so that they could
Dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon so that they could
Die, die, die, die

Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
Come to an end, come to an
Why do all good things come to an end
Come to an end, come to an
Why do all good things come to an end

Well the dogs were barking at the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon
And the sun was wondering if it should
Stay away for a day 'til the feeling went away
And the sky was falling
And the clouds were dropping and the rain
Forgot how to bring salvation
The dogs were barking at the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon so that they could die
