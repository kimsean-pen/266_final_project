Crazy but I'm relieved this time
Begging for sweet relief of blessing in disguise
Dying behind these tired eyes
I've been losin' sleep, please come to me tonight

Hands on a miracle, I got my hands on a miracle
Leave it or not, hands on a miracle
And there ain't no way, let you take it away

Everything that we survived
It's gonna be alright, just lucky we're alive
Got no vision I've been blind
Searchin' everywhere, you're right here in my sights

Hands on a miracle, I got my hands on a miracle
Leave it or not, hands on a miracle
And there ain't no way, let you take it away

Hands on a miracle, I got my hands on a miracle
Leave it or not, hands on a miracle
I got my hands on a miracle
And there ain't no way, let you take it away

Take it away, take it away
