Caught in the wind like the willow tree
Gold like the leaves and soon to be free
It's blowing

Don't know where we're going tonight

Seasons will come but it's our time to go
Nothing to learn but it's our time to know
We're falling
Falling from the willow tree

This wind keeps blowing
Wherever it's going
And will always take you there
'Cause it don't care

Hitchhikers on the open road
Two lovers in an endless ocean
We can go anywhere in the world (where in the world)
Hitchhiking from the willow tree
Break it off before your dreams get broken
Sick of waiting for the time to go
Who do you wanna be...

Fish from a pond who were given the sea
'Cause who we are now is not who we will be
We're perfect, so perfectly

Average at best so that we pass the test
Answers to all that they could ever ask
But questions
Is all there seems to be, yeah

Hitchhikers on the open road
Two lovers in an endless ocean
We can go anywhere in the world
Hitchhiking from the willow tree
Break it off before your dreams get broken
Sick of waiting for the time to go
Who do you wanna be...

Lost again
We're on our own again
We can get lost again
And I don't care, I don't care

'Cause I'm with you
Yeah, I'm with you

Hitchhikers on the open road
Two lovers in an endless ocean
We can go anywhere in the world (where in the world)
Hitchhiking from the willow tree
Break it off before your dreams get broken
Sick of waiting for the time to go
Who do you wanna be...
