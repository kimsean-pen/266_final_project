So cold, in the night, where the river flows, where the river flows.
So cold, in the night, where the river flows, where the river flows.

Sail away, hey, I'm sorry; every day is a new day.

Hooray for love, hey, I'm lonely,
Trying to find a new way.

So cold, in the night, where the rivers slow, say the river's slow,
So cold, in the night, where the rivers slow, say the river's slow,
So cold...

Connect!

So cold, in the night, hold on, hold on
So cold, in the night, hold on, hold on

Sail away, hey I'm sorry; every day's a new day,

Hooray for love, hey I'm lonely,
Try and be on your way,
On your way, on your way
On your way,

She loves me not
