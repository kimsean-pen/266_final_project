To see you today

So long I have towards
I'm coming
To see you today

And I'm trying to be first
I'm winning
To be here today

And who cares if I fail
So long as it sails
I'm home

Home
For you

I'm coming
To see you today

And you run till I
I'm killing
To see you today

And who cares
If it fails
And who cares
If it stings
And who watches
And waits
Whose
To the brain
I'm home

Home
For you
