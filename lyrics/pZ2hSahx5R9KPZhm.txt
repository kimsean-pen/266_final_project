Slayyyter, Uh

Been a while since I seen you 'round
Doing good, how about you?
Heard you talking like we used to talk
Does she does it like I used to?
First you want me then you change your mind
But you got a girl and that's a fact
Then I hear you go and talking trash
I ain't having none of that

You bad mouth every friend that you have
And I know it for a fact 'cause they call you out by name
Fucked up every dream that you had with the scenes and the fads
Baby, you just look so lame
You try to repair what you broke
But you slipped up again and you ran away back home
Now you have nobody to turn to
I think that you belong alone

Been a while since I seen your face
Yo what's good? Nothing new, ooh
Baby I could never be replaced
But you know that its you, ooh
You should know to never play with fire
'Cause I'm always ready to attack
Yeah, I heard that you been talking trash
I ain't having none of that

You bad mouth every friend that you have
And I know it for a fact 'cause they call you out by name
Fucked up every dream that you had with the scenes and the fads
Baby, you just look so lame
You try to repair what you broke
But you slipped up again and you ran away back home
Now you have nobody to turn to
I think that you belong alone

That you belong alone
That you belong alone, babe
Yeah, yeah

Baby, please
You lost your mind if you think that you could hurt me
I'm at ease, yeah, I'm on top of the world
It's clear that you do not deserve me
I hope your girlfriend sees all the
messages that you been sending my way
And that you end up alone
Hey, hey, hey

You bad mouth every friend that you have
And I know it for a fact 'cause they call you out by name
Fucked up every dream that you had with the scenes and the fads
Baby, you just look so lame
You try to repair what you broke
But you slipped up again and you ran away back home
Now you have nobody to turn to
I think that you belong alone
