We back!

Been around the world a few times on a mission
Unfamiliar sound that you been hearing know you miss me
I've been running around the globe and no
I don't forget to mention
Left Eye still here irreplaceable position
Forever keep it Crazy Sexy with that AC on blast
We gon' do it in the future like we did it in the past
They know me out in Tijuana
Millions feel the full effect
Coming from your speakers
We don't need no scrubs chasing waterfalls
Just have that red light when the money calls
We don't need no scrubs chasing waterfalls
Just have that red light when the money calls

No we don't need no introduction
No we don't need no instructions
Yeah we've already paved the way
And we don't got no time to play

We back!
Call my lawyer
We back!
Call my girls up!
We back!
I thought I told ya
We back!
No it ain't over
We back!

No we don't need no introduction
No we don't need no introduction
No we don't need no introduction
No we don't need no introduction

Down I been up
Down I been up
I been down I been up
Down I been up

We keep the hits comin'
We keep the party jumpin'
We're nowhere near done yet
We play in every country
We keep it 100 100
We know you want it want it
Coming from your speakers

No we don't need no introduction
No we don't need no instructions
Yeah we've already paved the way
And we don't got no time to play

We back!
Call my lawyer
We back!
Call my girls up!
We back!
I thought I told ya
We back!
Cuz it ain't over
We back!
