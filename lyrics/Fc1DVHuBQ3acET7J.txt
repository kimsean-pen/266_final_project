Wild ride
Hold your fire
I'm not about to die

Keep back
Let in some air
I dare lie down
To stare at the sky

High and wide open
Reaching forever
I fly into the blue

High and wide open
Reaching forever
I fly into the blue

Flood mark
High tide
Frantic to stay afloat

Stay calm
Let in some air
I dare lie down
To stare at the sky

High and wide open
Reaching forever
I fly into the blue

High and wide open
Reaching forever
I fly into the blue

From above
I am so small, so fast
I move, I move
The light, the light
Here comes the tide

High and wide open
Reaching forever
I fly into the blue

(With water surrounding)
High and wide open
(I fly, through the delight I fly)
Reaching forever
I fly into the blue

High and wide open
Reaching forever
I fly into the blue

High and wide open
Reaching forever
I fly into the blue

High and wide open
Reaching forever
I fly into the blue...
