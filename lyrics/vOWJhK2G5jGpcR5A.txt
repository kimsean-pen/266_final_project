Liturgy of light
I am going backwards
To be more precise
Are we still here?

History of shame
I will not spell it
Liturgy of light
it's fading out

Well it's a
hard life
that we share

it's a
hard life
for us young ones

it's written all around

Some of it is true
but we can't see it
the news are full of faults
where's all the hope?

all together now
can we recite it
say liturgy of light
it's fading out

Well it's a
hard life
that we share

It's a
hard life
for us young ones

and it's a
long road
that we share

it's a
long road
for us young ones

it's written all around
all around
it's written all around
all around
