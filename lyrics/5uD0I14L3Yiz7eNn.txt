If I get to know you, baby
Maybe I can hold you down
If I get to take you down
Maybe I can hold you back
If can love you, baby
Maybe I can hold you down

If I get to know you, baby
Maybe I can hold you down
If I get to take you down
Maybe I can hold you back
If can love you, baby
Maybe I can hold you down

If I get to know you, baby
If I get to know you, baby
If I get to know you, baby
If I get to know you, baby
If I get to know you, baby
If I get to know you, baby
