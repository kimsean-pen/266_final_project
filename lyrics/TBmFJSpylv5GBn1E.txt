It's so amazing how much comes to life
And I wonder what the last thing you remember was
Was it scratching my back 'til I fell asleep?
Or was it pulling me apart 'til you made me leave?

Harry, you don't even know me
Lately, I don't even know myself

It's not surprising how little we talk
And I wonder when our last good conversation was
Watching the motion detector light
That lit up your driveway as I stared into darkness
I'm feeling better than this
I'm feeling better than this

Harry, you don't even know me
Lately, I don't even know myself

But that's okay
I'll be fine if you're fine
I'll be there
I'll be there

Harry, you don't even know me
Lately, I don't even know myself
Harry, you don't even know me
(Stuck in the middle, stuck in the middle
I don't even know what the fuck to feel)
Lately
