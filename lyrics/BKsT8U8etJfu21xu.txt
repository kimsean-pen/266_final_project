This is survival
This is my exile

I find no solace
I find no solace
Beneath a Godless sky

Will I find shelter
In the places the Sun could never find?
Now behold the consequence

The aftermath of ignorance
Shackled to my worthless neck
Give me one reason to resist

So I, I slip below
I can't resist the undertow
So I, I slip below
I can't resist the undertow

I find no solace
Beneath a Godless sky
Will I find shelter

In the places the Sun could never find?
Because everything's turning black
And I see no hope of turning back

Cold terror grips my lungs to let it in would be to accept defeat
But what's left to fight for?
When I look inside the nothingness confronts me

Vexed by the hands of time
This is survival
I against I

What's left inside?
What's left inside?
What's left inside?

So I, I slip below
I can't resist the undertow
So I, I slip below
I can't resist the undertow

I can't resist
No, I can't resist
I can't resist
No, I can't resist

No, I can feel the deadweight
I can feel the deadweight of my soul
Dragging me from this world
The deadweight.
