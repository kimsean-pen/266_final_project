Can we take the long way home?
I don't want to be alone
Now I think you're lonely too
Now I want to be with you

I don't want to live and lose
I don't want to be abused
If you don't hurt me I won't hurt you back
I don't want to lose you

I don't want to live and lose
I don't want to be abused
If you don't hurt me I won't hurt you back
I don't want to lose you
(Lose you)

Don't want to live and lose
I don't want to be abused
If you don't hurt me I won't hurt you back
I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose you
