A: Way To Eternity

...quem quaerimus adjutorem, nisi te, Domine.
Sancte Dues, Sancte Fortis, Sancte misericors Salvator,
amarae morti ne tradas nos.

B: Hallelujah

Turn off the light, take a deep breath, and relax, relax...
Turn off the light, take a deep breath, relax ...

C: The Rivers Of Belief

Take me back to the rivers of belief
Take me back to the rivers of belief
my friend
I look inside my heart
I look inside my soul
I promise you
I will return
And when the Lamb opened the seventh seal
silence covered the sky
Take me back to the rivers of belief
Take me back to the rivers of belief
my friend
I look inside my heart
I look inside my soul
I'm reaching out for you
Lets hope one day
We'll rest in peace
on my rivers of belief
