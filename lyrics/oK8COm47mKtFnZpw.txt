It was a day like today
A Sunday afternoon when they took you away
Down to Hades in a shopping trolley
With a magazine and a suitcase
They stole your clothes
I took your watch
I couldn't look you in the eye
Why is it always those who you love the most, you criticise, saying

Oh no stranger, you're just like me,
These things happen, we were children in the mid-90's
Saying, oh no stranger, you're just like me,
We get older, they get younger, it was you or me

We stood there throwing ice cream in your hair
How I solemly swear
It's the thing in life I regret the most
Leaving you standing there
And if you asked me I'd put my eyes out
And when I woke up blind
If you forgave me I would sleep at night
Knowing I'd led a good life

Oh no stranger, you're just like me,
These things happen, we were children in the mid-90's
Saying, oh no stranger, you're just like me,
We get older, they get younger, it was you or me

Learnin' how to keep living

Oh no stranger, you're just like me,
These things happen, we were children in the mid-90's
Saying, oh no stranger, you're just like me,
We get older, they get younger, it was you or me
