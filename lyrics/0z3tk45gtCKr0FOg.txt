Oh!
Two, three, four!

Helpless!
My eyes are bleeding from the fear that's inside!
You sealed your demise when you
Took what was mine
Don't try to stop me from avenging this world!
No voice to be heard!

Waking the demon!
Where'd you run to?
Walking in shadows!
Watch the blood flow
There's not much longer, so don't try and fight
Your body's weakening, walk to the light
Those painful times so alone, so ashamed
I'm not coming back, there's nothing to gain!

Caution!
There's just no limit to the boundaries you push!
I've warned you but still you just
Fuck with my mind!
There's no escape from this rage that I feel!
Nothing is real!

Waking the demon!
Where'd you run to?
Walking in shadows!
Watch the blood flow
There's not much longer, so don't try and fight
Your body's weakening, walk to the light
Those painful times so alone, so ashamed
I'm not coming back, there's nothing to gain!

Breathe for me
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me
Possession taking over
Breathe for me
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me
Possession taking over

Whoah!
Shred!

Breathe for me
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me
Possession taking over
Breathe for me
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me
Possession taking over

Waking the demon!
