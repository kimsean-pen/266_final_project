They say it's matter of time,
a thousand days and the sun won't shine,
before i come back to you.

I'm happy, nothing's going to stop me.
I'm making my way home, i'm making my way.

For you love i will go far
I wanna be wherever you are
I know i'm coming back for you.

Our love is a river long,
The best right in a million wrongs,
I know i'm coming back to you.

And i'm happy nothing's going to be stop me
I'm making my way home,
I'm making my way
