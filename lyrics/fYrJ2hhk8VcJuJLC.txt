Sometimes I'm a selfish fake
You're always a true friend
And I don't deserve you
'Cause I'm not there for you
Please forgive me again

I wanna be there for you
Someone you can come to
Runs deeper than my bones
I wanna be there for you (I wanna be there for you)

Swirling shades of blue
Slow dancing in your eyes
The sun kisses the earth
And I hush my urge to cry
Cry

I wanna be there for you
Someone you can come to
Runs deeper than my bones
I wanna be there for you
(I wanna be there for you)

'Cause I hear the whispered words
In your masterpiece beautiful
You speak the unspeakable through
I love you too

I wanna be there for you
Someone you can come to
I wanna be there for you
And be someone you can come to
The love, it runs deeper than my bones
I wanna be there for you
