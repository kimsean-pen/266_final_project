Don't lay there dead, c'mon boy, get up

Give me that driving satisfaction
(Gimme, gimme that driving satisfaction)
I need your positive reaction
(Gimme, gimme that, ooh, reaction)

Hey you, standing in the room
Like you don't know where to go
Hey you, got no money to spend
A dog wouldn't be your friend

Give me that driving satisfaction
(Gimme, gimme that driving satisfaction)
I need a positive reaction
(Gimme, gimme that, ooh, reaction)

Give me that driving satisfaction
(Gimme, gimme that driving satisfaction)
I need a positive reaction
(Gimme, gimme that, ooh, reaction)

Hey you, the night is cold
Hey you, I'm all alone
Hey you, I need somebody to hold

You're right, you're wrong
You're stuck in the middle of the road
You're up, you're down, way down there below

You're right, you're wrong
Stuck in the middle of the road
You're up, you're down, way down there below

Get up, boy
And give me that driving satisfaction
(Gimme, gimme that driving satisfaction)
I need a positive reaction
(Gimme, gimme that, ooh, reaction)

Give me that driving satisfaction
(Gimme, gimme that driving satisfaction)

In the middle of the night in a certain kind of heat
(The heat, you feel the heat)
If the odds are against you
You're facing sure defeat, yeah

Hey, hey, hey, hey you
Hey, hey, hey, hey you

Your life is green, you still can't make a move
Get up, my friend, you've got something to prove
You're life is greed, you're stuck in the middle of the road
You're up, you're down, way down there below

Driving satisfaction
(Gimme, gimme that driving satisfaction)
I need a positive reaction, yeah boy
(Gimme, gimme that, ooh, reaction)

Give me that driving satisfaction

Hey you, give me what you promised me
Take me for a ride

Hey you, I'm talking to you
Hey you, don't hurt me, baby
Burning, I'm burning
(Hey you)
Burning, burning with desire

Give me that driving satisfaction
(Gimme, gimme that driving satisfaction)
I need a positive reaction
