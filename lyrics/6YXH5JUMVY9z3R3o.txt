I built a wall
Around this heart of mine
Never letting no one in
Didn't think I'd need a friend

Until now
Feeling this way won't do
I'm ready to give all of me
The question that I have of you

Will he say the things he needs to say
Or touch me in a certain way?
I told myself just to be strong
One day the man will come along so

What will I do? Where will I go?
When it's my turn, how will I know
That you're the man, I'm dreaming of
I hope this time it's love

What will I do? Where will I go?
When it's my turn, how will I know
That you're the man, I'm dreaming of
I hope this time it's love

Now you've opened up this heart of mine
You made me feel like no one else
Showed me there's
Someone besides myself

That I can depend on
Looking back I finally see
Exactly what you mean to me

You touched me in that special way
Said all the things a man should say
I kept my faith and I just stayed strong
My man finally came along

What will I do? Where will I go?
When it's my turn, how will I know
That you're the man, I'm dreaming of
I hope this time it's love

What will I do? Where will I go?
When it's my turn, how will I know
That you're the man, I'm dreaming of
I hope this time it's love

Every single day with you
My love grows deeper and stronger it's true
'Cuz you showed me things I've never known
You gave me strength to carry on

'Cuz sometimes I'm afraid to let you in
Even though I know you're a good man
Still thoughts of doubt run through my mind
There's questions I have so tell me what should I do

What will I do? Where will I go?
When it's my turn, how will I know
That you're the man, I'm dreaming of
I hope this time it's love

What will I do? Where will I go?
When it's my turn, how will I know
That you're the man, I'm dreaming of
I hope this time it's love

What will I do? Where will I go?
When it's my turn, how will I know
That you're the man, I'm dreaming of
I hope this time it's love

What will I do? Where will I go?
When it's my turn, how will I know
That you're the man, I'm dreaming of
I hope, I hope this time it's love

I hope it is love, I hope it is love
Forever in love this time
Forever in love this time
I hope, I hope this time it's love
