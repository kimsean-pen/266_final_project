...
Mmm A long and lonely journey
To my hideaway
And I know they'll try to turn me
With the things that they say
But no one knows where I'll go
When I walk away
So come now hurry hurry
Don't miss this train

Open up and let me get to you
Take you to another side
Come to my world
After midnight

We're getting lost in another time
Your hand in mine
In my own world, on my own time
Maybe that's why

(I don't mind...)
People think I'm crazy
Lately I'm
(I'll be fine...)
Living in midnight
Just living in midnight
(Ohhh...)
And if you think I'm crazy
Pay it no mind
(Ohhh...)
Living in midnight
Just living in midnight

Oh, if you could see what I've seen
You would dare to dream
Honey if you care to join me
Come meet the team

Oh and you all can be my army
There's no other way
So come now hurry hurry
Don't miss this train

(I don't mind...)
People think I'm crazy
Lately I'm
(I'll be fine...)
Living in midnight
Just living in midnight
(Ohhh...)
And if you think I'm crazy
Pay it no mind
(Ohhh...)
You'll never know the places I go
When I'm alone

If only for a moment
Only for a while
'Cause I'll be lost to the unknown
Hope to be alright
Ohhh, ohhh...

(I don't mind...)
People think I'm crazy
Lately I'm
(I'll be fine...)
Living in midnight
Just living in midnight
(Ohhh...)
And if you think I'm crazy
Pay it no mind
(Ohhh...)
Living in midnight
Just living in midnight

(I don't mind...)
People think I'm crazy
Lately I'm
(I'll be fine...)
Living in midnight
Just living in midnight
(Ohhh...)
And if you think I'm crazy
Pay it no mind
(Ohhh...)
You'll never know the places I go
When I'm alone
