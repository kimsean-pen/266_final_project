This is a message
pay attention
I got something to say
pleasant information

This is me walking
that you're waving
this might get away
my taste of freedom

Goodbye
goodbye

This is a calling
not a conversation
no manipulation
if love is a season
you are my winter
you are just the ice
layin' on my finger

This is a message
pay attention
nobody's gonna love me the wrong way again
this is a calling
not a conversation
this is my overdue goodbye
yeah, overdue goodbye

Oh, in my tomorrow
all the fields are golden
and all the papers say
that the spell's been broken

To my future lover
fate will find you
'cause you have the power
of truth behind you, yeah

Goodbye
oh, yeah
goodbye
said goodbye, baby

This is a message
pay attention
nobody's gonna love me the wrong way again
this is a calling
not a conversation
this is my overdue goodbye

Yeah yeah

Goodbye
I said goodbye
goodbye
I said goodbye baby

This is a message
pay attention
nobody's gonna love me the wrong way again
oh yeah
this is a calling
not a conversation
this is my overdue goodbye

(this is a message) oooh
(pay attention) said pay attention
(nobody's gonna love me the wrong way again) nobody, nobody, no
(this is a calling) a calling
(not a conversation)
this is my overdue goodbye
