At The Time Of Sundown
Nature Bathes In Colours
In Silence It Waits
For The Approaching Force
In The Halls Of Ainola
The True King Of Dark Waters
Lurks With His Mistress

And A Mob Of A Sea Creatures
Under The Waves Of A Blue Lake
Dwells The Mighty AHTI!
Sailors Praise The Glorious Name

Of The Ruler Of Tides; AHTI!
At The Shores Of A Northern Land
Pray Mortal Men
Destruction for The Arrogant Fools

A Reward For Humble Souls
The Great Lurker Of The Seas
Is Pleased Of The Sacrifice
The Waters Are Calm

Today No Storm Shall Rise!
Under The Waves Of A Blue Lake
Dwells The Mighty AHTI!
Sailors Praise The Glorious Name

Of The Ruler Of Tides; AHTI!
Under The Waves Of A Blue Lake
Dwells The Mighty AHTI!
Sailors Praise The Glorious Name
Of The Ruler Of Tides; AHTI!
Foreign Ship Filled With Infidels
They Didn't Listen To The Northern Men

From A Dead Calm Storm Will Rise
And They'll Face The Wrath Of The Sea
Take Care That Your Heir
Don't Turn Out Too Proud
Or Your Bloodline Will Drown
Into A Vast Ocean...
Under The Waves Of A Blue Lake
Dwells The Mighty AHTI!
Sailors Praise The Glorious Name
Of The Ruler Of Tides; AHTI!
Under The Waves Of A Blue Lake
Dwells The Mighty AHTI!
Sailors Praise The Glorious Name
Of The Ruler Of Tides; AHTI!
