Reborn and shivering
Spat out on new terrain
Unsure, unconvincing
This faint and shaky hour

Day one, day one, start over again
Step one, step one, I am barely making sense
From now I'm faking it 'til I'm pseudo making it
From scratch, begin again, but this time I as I? And not as we?

Gun shy and quivering
Timid, without a hand
Feign brave with steel intent
Little and hardly here

Day one, day one, start over again
Step one, step one, with not much making sense
Just yet I'm faking it 'til I'm pseudo making it
From scratch, begin again, but this time I as I? And not as we?

Eyes wet, toward
Wide open frayed
If God's taking bets
I pray He wants to lose

Day one, day one, start over again
Step one, step one, I am barely making sense
Just yet I'm faking it 'til I'm pseudo making it
From scratch, begin again, but this time I as I? And not as we?.
