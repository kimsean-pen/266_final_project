Be still
So I can focus on your heartbeat
But there is no space for us to meet
While you fill it with your brain

And all the words
Will not help you understand
I know you want to understand love
But you have to learn to feel love

You're an analyzer

Be still
'Til your heart turns from red to green
You're in a hurry to get behind the screen
But you can't do it with your head

Sift through the makeshift thrift
Somewhere you will find my gift to you
I hope you find a new direction
I know you're reaching for perfection

You're an analyzer

Be still
So I focus on your heartbeat
But there is no space for us to meet
While you fill it with your brain
