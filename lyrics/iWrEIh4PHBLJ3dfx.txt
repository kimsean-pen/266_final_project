Now I can move on to facing
Big girl problems
No more high school drama
Graduated with honors

And I'm drinkin' coffee while I
Read the paper
I've been savin' money, eatin'
Only top ramen

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Now I get a holiday
Wherever I go I might stay
I don't plan on coming back
Ever if I can help it

Now I get a holiday
I think I'll stay
Holiday, think I'll stay
Now I get a holiday
