This road is long
And you've been here all along
Been here all along
Now that you're gone It's all been left undone
Cause you're the only one, who stops Time from ticking by
I need you by my side
Don't let this world die in darkness
Don't let me drown in this silence
ever let go of your promise
Always remember your promise
Cause time is ticking by
Another day to night
Don't let this world die in darkness
Don't let me drown in this silence Always remember your promise
Never let go of your promise
Our end feels near It's everything I feared
Everything we feared
I'll still be here
Minute, day and Year Cause
I believe that we can't let
Time just pass us by
I need you by my side
Don't let this world die in darkness
Don't let me drown in this silence
