Reaching out for me
Dreary bones, awake
My sullen heart you're wrapped around
A salvo when the tension breaks

It won't leave you alone, ooh
It won't leave you alone, ooh
It won't leave you alone, ooh
It won't leave you alone, ooh

I can see the end of this
The said and done
It's only love for once
You took your time

It won't leave you alone, ooh
It won't leave you alone, ooh
It won't leave you alone, ooh
It won't leave you alone, ooh

It won't leave you alone, ooh
It won't leave you alone, ooh
It won't leave you alone, ooh
It won't leave you alone, ooh
