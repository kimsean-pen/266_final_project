Ooh life is incredible
Ooh when the sun is in your eyes

Life's kind of like a video game
Bigger than it looks and fundamentally strange
And then you die, That's why
I'm eating snacks and chillin with babes
And I don't really give a flying fuck what you say
Cause I'm high, yeah so high up on my wave

Ooh life is incredible
Ooh when the sun is in your eyes

I'm sick and tired of these negative people
That fill their hearts with hatred and hide inside of a steeple
Like wake up, try not to suck
I'm having fun for the rest of my days
yo quiero chicas, e yo quiero postres
That's right, it's all right with me

It's like haven't you had enough
Why you gotta act so tough
Please take a good look around and tell me what you see
Its right in front of your eyes
Ooh life is incredible
Ooh when the sun is in your eyes

So on and on and on it goes
(On and on it goes)

Ooh the sun is in my my eyes

On and on and on it goes
(On and on it goes)

So ask me what I'm counting on
(nothing anymore)

Its a physical phenomenon

On and on and on it goes
(On and on it goes)
