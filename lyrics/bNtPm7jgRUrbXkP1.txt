Copper, let us take you
To the furnace where we'll break you
The fire so big and pretty, you could cry
As you buckle you could ask me, "What was wrong with me before?
Did I need the silver to be suitable?"
Copper, I have a use for you, it's easy work and it suits you
Dazzled dirty beauty, you must know
Copper is a conductor and makes for decent cooking
Dazzled by your beauty still you know
Plated or anodized, you even fool a layman's eyes
Presentable though you might be, it's unwise to try to fight me

Copper - you'll never be gold (x2)
