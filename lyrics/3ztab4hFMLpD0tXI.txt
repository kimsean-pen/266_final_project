If you ever been there
I love you with no spare
I'll tell it to the stars

So when I get sad
I love you that's why
I'll tell it to the stars
Soon as I, get home tonight
Soon as I, get home tonight

So when you get sad
I love you that's why
I'll tell it to the stars
Soon as I, get home tonight Soon as I, get home tonight
