Simple test at best
All is nothing less
Run for more
I can't decide
Love in the grass
All is nothing less
Rather
You look me in the eye
Dog face creeping in
Your caring thankless grin
Immobilize the second sin
Create the mood that's dark and grim

known so long
feels like the next of kin

whilst in the back

to resurrect what's left to die

understand bells mourn the tired

I'm trapped and now i fade away
