i'm just a foreign faction
irreconcilable conflict at parties
i feel like a chain reaction
but sadly i don't know where it started

i never wanted anything
and i never got it
i never wanted anything
and i never got it

i like to sit around fires and catch the embers on my tongue
listening to a church choir sings some hymns about someone

i never wanted anything
and i never got it
i never wanted anything
and i never got it

i'm just a foreign faction
irreconcilable conflict at parties
i feel like a chain reaction
but sadly i don't know where it started

i never wanted anything
and look i got it
i never wanted anything
and look i got it
look i got it
