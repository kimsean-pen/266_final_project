In dust, I crave. Only fogs of shame
I can't reveal what I've seen
This place is even darker and I'm only insane
I'll remember you

The bloodstains on my hands speak
Of only about the killings, but of not what I have in me

Falling through ashes to hell

The light in me is fading
No second thoughts now
My blackened heart is leaking
I'm blowing the fires in hell

The words in rust are fading
No second thoughts now
My blackened heart is empty
I'm fueling the fires in hell

In hell

Embrace the conclusion
I'll never be set free ever again

In dust, I crave. Only pillars in game
I can't speak of, of what I've seen
This hell is even darker and I'm only deranged
I'll remember death

The bloodstains on my hands speak
Of only about the victims, but of not who I have in me

In me

Falling through ashes to hell

The light in me is fading
No second thoughts now
My blackened heart is leaking
I'm blowing the fires in hell

The words in rust are fading
No second thoughts now
My blackened heart is empty
I'm fueling the fires in hell

In hell

Embrace the conclusion
I'll never be set free ever again

Break the chains
I've been living too long under the sea
In the dark

Now that I'm free
This concrete box will be waiting for me
But my cell is me

Showcase, the conquer of my freedom
This killer you think you caught lightly
This man does not break easy, because he never existed

Because he never existed

I've killed for the chance to save myself
For the chance of breathing slowly
If you only can look closely
It changes a man

In pain, I've witnessed their dismay
I've started to decay
But the thing in me has whispered
There is no-one inside but me
