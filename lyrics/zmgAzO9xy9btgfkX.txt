How did the crowd get so lonely
How did the dream get so old
How did the road, in the palm of the hand
Get so heavy to hold
How did the thread grow so slender
Must be a bit, hanging on
Maybe we can, start over again
Before the echo is gone

If it really must be going out
If the final leaf must fall
Oh, maybe it could leave at least a shadow
On the wall

Up above, there's a sea of love
Under heaven's control
The slower we get, the faster it stays
Then the further it goes

Guess I was just lucky to grab it
To have it, to hold
Was as new as the smoke
The shape of your heart
And the size, of my soul

But if it really must be going out
If that's all
Well see if it could leave at least a shadow
See if it could leave at least a shadow
See if it could leave at least a shadow
See if it could leave at least a shadow
A shadow
See if it could leave at least a shadow
On the wall
On the wall
