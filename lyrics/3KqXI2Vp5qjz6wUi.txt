Just say the word and I'll be on my way,
regardless of the time, it's just how I was
made. To explain; I'm here for a reason so
make use of me. I'm hungry and I'm thirsty so
I hope you'll be joining. My Father is a helper
but my Father made mistakes. I see myself in
him as I'm a product of his ways. You can stay
here tonight, I won't ask any questions. Don't
call it polite, it's just a suggestion. Please stay
here tonight. I'd be a liar if I said I was ready
for this. I have a past and a poison, that I can
admit. But this is what I need to bury the years
of debris to break the circle of the cycles and
stop living vicariously and start living for me.
