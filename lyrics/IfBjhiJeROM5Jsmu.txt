Those voices yelling
And the pain is overwhelming
It's a fault of mine
And yeah, I'm guessing
That I should be kind of happy
It's a fault of mine

With all the tension
You still keep me second-guessing
'Cause I'm so benign
(Go on, go on, go)
And yeah I know
It's kind of hard to let it go
It's all so asinine
(Go on, go on, go)

We have to figure out another way to go
So I can follow, so I can follow
We have to figure out another way to go

Betray and degrade me now
I'll savor how
This emptiness defines you
And take from this tortured sound
My hands are bound
This shallow mist can find you

I'm never the same
I'm never enough
There's something dead inside me
I fell all alone
And couldn't get up
With no one there to guide me

We have to figure out another way to go
So I can follow, so I can follow
We have to figure out another way to go

Betray and degrade me now
I'll savor how
This emptiness defines you
And take from this tortured sound
My hands are bound
This shallow mist can find you

I'm so sick
You make me sick
I'm so sick
You make me sick

I'm never the same
I'm never enough
There's something dead inside me

Betray and degrade me now
I'll savor how
This emptiness defines you
And take from this tortured sound
My hands are bound
This shallow mist can find you

Sick
You make me sick
Sick
You make me sick
