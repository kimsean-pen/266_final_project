Well, these walls are just high enough to keep you locked in
Locked in for a lifetime
Well, you're one lousy step from not makin' it
You only got a ghost of a chance, my brother
You only got a ghost of a chance

Well, maybe someday we'll get a new start
You never grow too old to dream
Save the sermon for Sunday
'Cause we'll be back one day
You only got a ghost of a chance, my brother
You only got a ghost of a chance

Well, follow your instincts always
Don't ever doubt yourself
When the odds are small, don't let 'em stop ya
'Cause we only got a ghost of a chance, my brother
We only got a ghost of a chance
We only got a ghost of a chance, my brother
We only got a ghost of a chance
