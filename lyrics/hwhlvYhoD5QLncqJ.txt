You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
Everyday I feel this pain
But you just doubt it, walk away
No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong
With you and me, yeah...
Touch me and then turn away
You put your hands into the flame
Tell me if you feel this pain
Because I don't want to be a ball and chain
No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and, woah
I just don't know what is wrong

With you and me
I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me, you and me, With you and me
