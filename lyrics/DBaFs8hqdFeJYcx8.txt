I can't afford not to make a mistake
It's 5am and I'm full of hate
All the gauze, feel the waves in my brain
Saying things I shouldn't say

Immediate urge to get everything all straight
Need to express it, but it's not the time or place
Get strength from what you don't reveal
Communication's pretty hard
I've got some thoughts I cling to
What makes you bitter makes you old

A lot of time to sit and think
And the thoughts don't come naturally
Feeling out of touch with reality
But you've got the answers that I need

Immediate urge to get everything all straight
Need to express it, but it's not the time or place
Get strength from what you don't reveal
Communication's pretty hard
I've got some thoughts I cling to
What makes you bitter makes you old
