So what you say we get up
Not spend our whole day just in
He said you've got some things to do anyway
We'll go to the park and just lie down
Well I'll leave anyway
We'll waste another day
In here, alone

Do the right thing
The right thing now
The right thing
The right thing

Do the right thing
The right thing now
The right thing
The right thing

She's right calling you lazy
Who knows about what else?
You said it didn't matter to you anyway
Please just come to the park for an hour
It's real nice out there today

Do the right thing

The right thing

Do the right thing
The right thing now
The right thing
The right thing

Do the right thing
The right thing now
The right thing
