Failure broke your best intentions,
Left you cold and insecure,
Wondering if your illusions
Are something still worth fighting for.
Expectation fills their faces:
Will you stand or will you fall?
This is not the last deception
That you will ever come across

You cannot change your mind,
You've got to take the world
You cannot fail; the time to act is now.

Time will have no mercy on us,
Time will flow relentlessly;
We can't take the hours for granted
While in pursuit of our beliefs.
I will keep on marching forward,
I will never close my eyes,
My devotion and your glory
Fade every time you're out of sight.

You cannot change your mind,
You've got to change the world
You cannot fail; the time to act is now or never.
You cannot change your mind,
You've got to take the world
You cannot fail; the time to act is now or never.

You cannot change your mind,
You'll take over the world
You cannot fail; the time to act is now or never.
You cannot change your mind,
You've got to take the world
You cannot fail; the time to act is now or never.
