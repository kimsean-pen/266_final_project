We must be vigilant and strong within this war
You cannot die, you have to live, that's what it's for
There is a time for living life and killing scars
Time to live, time to die
There is no future, there's no present, only pain
And when you cry, your love is dying all the same
It's time to die, we must be vigilant and safe
Time to live, time to die

Winter solstice (rise as the snow's coming)
Before life is over (rise up and look for it)
Executive order (I close my eyes off to it [?])
Before night is over, the song is not over
Winter fortress ([?])
Before life is over (rise up and look for it)
Executive order (try to get into it now)

My playing in the wind is over
Oh
My playing in the wind is over
Oh
My playing in the wind is over
Come on

Time to live
Time to live
Time to live
Time to live
Time to live
Time to live
Time to live
Time to live
Time to live
