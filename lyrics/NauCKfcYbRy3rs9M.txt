He's been waiting around for the weekend
Figuring which club he'll sneak in
Fancy drinks and 50 dollar cover charge
Lately it's been a big hassle
Heineken and New Castle
To make sure he's fitting in and living large

Disregard the lies that he will tell
And what he's probably like
'Cause it's not hard, his charm is gonna
Get him through the night

'Cause if he wanna rock, he rocks
If he wanna roll, he rolls
He can roll with the punches
Long as he feels like he's in control

If he wanna stay, he stays
If he wanna go, he goes
He doesn't care how he gets there
Long as he gets somewhere he knows
Oh, no

See her, heavy make up and cut t-shirt
Every girl out wants to be her
But they look the same already, why adjust?
Reading the magazine secrets
Forgetting the topical regrets
'Cause if she comes I'm all alone and night's a bust

It's a must the swivel in her hips
And the look she gives
It's all her trust if only in the morning
She knew where she lived

'Cause if she wanna rock, she rocks
If she wanna roll, she rolls
She can roll with the punches
Long as she feels like she's in control

And if she wanna stay, she stays
If she wanna go, she goes
She doesn't care how she gets there
Long as she gets somewhere she knows
Oh, no

And in a wink they're on the brink
From drinks to drink and at the bar
With cash to blow
Shot to shot it's getting hot
Advance the plot to see how far it's gonna go

All depends so ditch the friends and grab a cab
Another chance for cheap romance
Doesn't count 'cause the room is spinning
Nothing to lose tonight they both are winning
And they fall in love as they fall in bed, they sing

If they wanna rock, they rock
If they wanna roll, they roll
They can roll with the punches
Long as they feels like they're in control

And if they wanna stay, they stay
If they wanna go, they go
They don't care how they get there
Long as they get somewhere they know
Oh, no

If they wanna rock, they rock
If they, if they wanna roll, they roll
They can roll with the punches
Long as they get somewhere they know

If they wanna stay, they stay
If they wanna go, they go
They don't care how they get there
Long as they get somewhere they know
