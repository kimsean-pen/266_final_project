Where am I?
How I got in here?
I feel so tired, as if I walk for many miles.
What I see is a door leading out of this room.
I am prepared to confront whatever waits behind..."

MAD ARCHITECT

I left the room.
I am walking through a corridor.
It is so long that I cannot see its end.
Opening doors, moving in circle
Finding doors, moving in circle

A MADMAN (THE ARCHITECT) THIS LABYRINTH HAS BUILT.

Opening doors, moving in circle
Finding doors...
All the choices I once made, the paths that I designed,
Have formed this endless labyrinth, a product of my mind.

A MADMAN (THE ARCHITECT), THIS LABYRINTH HAS BUILT.
A MADMAN... THE ARCHITECT
He is trapped inside the maze.

Opening doors, moving in circle
Finding doors, moving in circle
A madman... the Architect
