Praying for myself
These thoughts I try to hide
I have faith in me and hope this will survive
But it's tearing me apart
I can't hear the words by which I guide
So I must ask again, who will carry me

I can not deny that nothing can defend
From the helplesness that's cutting deep inside
And I can't prevent the thought that nothing's real
Seems I've waited years for this day to end

The strength I need to feel, the pride inside of me
Are not there behind the face staring back at me
The anger and the pain of knowing where I am
I have come so far and I cannot return

Nothing I can do that I have not done
No words I can say. No truth left that I can see
So must I let this end, and everything falls apart
Before I live my life as I have always done

Tell me what to do so I do nothing wrong
Something I can hope for. Something real that I can see
So nothing falls apart. So this does not end
I cannot return. I can't start again

Nothing to deny, nothing to defend
From the helplessness, it's cutting me so deep inside
And I can't prevent the thought that's nothing's real
It seems I'm waiting years for this day to end

Praying for myself
These thoughts I try to hide
I have faith in me and hope this will survive
But it's tearing me apart
I can't hear the words by which I guide
So I must ask again, who will carry me

Nothing I can do that I have not done
No words I can say. No truth left that I can see
So must I let this end, and everything falls apart
Before I live my life as I have always done

Tell me what to do so I do nothing wrong
Something I can hope for. Something real that I can see
So nothing falls apart. So this does not end
I cannot return. I can't start again

Nothing I can do that I have not done
No words I can say. No truth left that I can see
So must I let this end, and everything falls apart
Before I live my life as I have always done

Tell me what to do so I do nothing wrong
Something I can hope for. Something real that I can see
So nothing falls apart. So this does not end
I cannot return. I can't start again
