You're right, you wanna be
This far away from me
I always treated you nice but not tonight

You're right, you'll never see
A meaner guy than me
But now I swear not to do you any harm

If someday you think I deserve
To have you in my arms again
You know my number and my address

If someday we ever fall in love
Would you promise to forget
The things I've done when
I was out of my head?

Believe in me...
When I say that I'd do anything to be again (inside your heart)
The box where you keep memories alive
When I say I'd rather die than be only a friend (back to the start)
I promise not to do you harm again!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Remember when I said I wish I had
A little paper box to keep you in
So I could see you everyday and night?

But now it feels like
There is nothing left inside
And I know this song won't bring you back

Believe in me...
When I say that I'd do anything to be again (inside your heart)
The box where you keep memories alive
When I say I'd rather die than be only a friend (back to the start)
I promise not to do you harm again!

When I say I'd rather die
When I say I'd rather not no cry
When I say please forgive me
Please forgive me

Rather die
When I say I'd rather not no cry
When I say please forgive me
Please forgive me
