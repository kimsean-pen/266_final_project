Wake up! Say good morning to that sleepy person lying next to you
If there's no one there, then there's no one there, but at least the war is over
It's us - yes, we're back again, here to see you through, 'til the days end
And if the night comes, and the night will come, well at least the war is over

Lift your head and look out the window
Stay that way for the rest of the day and watch the time go
Listen! The birds sing! Listen! The bells ring!
All the living are dead, and the dead are all living
The war is over and we are beginning...

Gridlock on the parkway now, the television man is here to show you how
The channle fades to snow, it's off to work you go, but at least the war is over

She's gone, she left before you woke, as you ate last night, neither of you spoke
Dishes, tv, bed the darkness filled with dread, but at least the war is over

Lift your head and look out the window
Stay that way for the rest of the day and watch the time go
Listen! The birds sing! Listen! The bells ring!
All the living are dead, and the dead are all living
The war is over and we are beginning...

We won, or we think we did, when you went away, you were just a kid
And if you lost it all, and you lost it, we will still be there when the war is over

Lift your head and look out the window
Stay that way for the rest of the day and watch the time go
Listen! The birds sing! Listen! The bells ring!
All the living are dead, and the dead are all living
The war is over and we are beginning...

Here it comes! Here comes the first day! Here it comes! Here comes the first day!
It starts up in our bedroom after the war
After the war! After the war...
