first love
heart breaker
i'll take you on a tail race

is this wonder land
my fire
my passion

run and see
Keep runnin' round
Keep runnin' round
and run and see
I run and see
keep runnin' round
run and see
I run and see
Run and see
keep runnin' round
run around

all because i would change your mind
all because i i wouldn't say
all because i let you lose your life
when you lose your own way

so sad
I'll take her
Cause you're lost...?
can't blame you
for getting me here
Can't get you out my head, yeah

Keep' runnin round
keep' runnin round

come close
open the door
draw the curtains
