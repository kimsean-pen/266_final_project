Love, my love
I regret the day you went away
I was too young to understand my love
But now I realise my mistakes

Where, where are you now? Now that I'm ready to
Ready to love you the way you loved me then
Where are you now? Do you still think of me?
Or does your heart belong to someone else instead

Love, oh my love
I wonder if sometimes were you just a dream
I sit in the dark wondering if our paths will ever cross again
Oh Lord, I need to know, I sit and wonder

Where, where are you now? Now that I'm ready to
Ready to love you the way you loved me then
Where are you now? Do you still think of me?
Or does your heart belong to someone else instead

If I close my eyes and make a wish
When they open will you be right here with me
Where are you now? Now that I'm ready to
Ready to love you the way you loved me then

Could it be that two people were meant to be, yeah, yeah
In my dreams that's what I feel
Could it be that I'll never see you again

My love that was so true
Still I sit here waiting all alone by the phone for you
Now I understand, now I understand
You said I love you, I sit and wonder

Where, where are you now? Now that I'm ready to
Ready to love you the way you loved me then
Where are you now? Do you still think of me?
Or does your heart belong to someone else instead

If I close my eyes, if I close my eyes
Head down and it go away
Tell me baby, tell me baby
Could you be right here with me

Where are you now? Where are you now?
Now that I'm ready to, ready to
Ready to love you the way you loved me then
Where are you now? Do you still think of me?
Or does your heart belong to someone else instead

Where are you now?
