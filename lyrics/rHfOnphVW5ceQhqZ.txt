She's capsizing
And the sea keeps rising
And my kneecaps start to shake
If I can't save us
Will the sea come take us
When the whitecaps start to break

Women and children
First sight of the new world

We tried a lot
She cried a lot
She said the struggle is no more
We act the part
I cracked her heart
Am I still one of the good ones
(That's a good one)

You wanna brawl
And crawl back into bed
But I can't move at all
I stalled it in my head
I'm out here playing dead
We are not fit to duel
Our parents gave us different pistols
Taught us different rules
Your father was cruel
This man you resent
Is, despite your best intentions, what I represent
I say it isn't right
You say you always right be prepared to fight
(Be prepared to fight, to fight)

She's capsizing
And the sea keeps rising
And my kneecaps start to shake
If I can't save us
Will the sea come take us
When the whitecaps start to break

Women and children
First sight of the new world

The taste of cocaine
Dixieland pain, King James,
Frank Ocean and Boy Scouts (Boy Scouts, boy scouts)
History's strange, rearranged plays
(James Franco, take it! Missed it, now)
(That's a good one)

It's sick
The way we fight and spit
Somehow we find each other even when we're trying to quit
'Cause right behind how our shit we like each other quit a bit
But I might admit it's pitiful the way the lie was split
A hundred thousand years and we're still trying to find the clit
But we don't have an ending yet
We get to write the script
It isn't gonna do to move our lips
We prove it with the chips (Prove it
with the chips, Prove it with the chips)

She's capsizing
And the sea keeps rising
And my kneecaps start to shake
If I can't save us
(Women and children)
Will the sea come take us
When the whitecaps start to break

She's capsizing
(Women and children)
And the sea keeps rising
And my kneecaps start to shake
If I can't save us
(Women and children)
Will the sea come take us
When the whitecaps start to break

First sight of the new world
First sight of the new world
First sight of the new world
First sight of the new world
