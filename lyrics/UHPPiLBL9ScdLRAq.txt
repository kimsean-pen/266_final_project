You stay all in one piece when broken
Kind remarks and your words soft spoken
Driving far from the path of destruction
Coming ever so close to throwing it all away again

Is this all some great big lie?
Twisting and working on
Something deep down
That you should've never kept inside

How much must I live through
Just to get away?
All this tension and so alive
How much must I live through
Just to get away?
All these pressures that make your head feel so tight

You've been through the worst encounters
Searching out the truth, the light, and way
You have thoughts of peace in silence
Coming ever so close to throwing it all away again

Is this all some great big lie?
Sick and disturbing
You want no answers
But you should have never looked inside

How much must I live through
Just to get away?
All this tension and so alive
How much must I live through
Just to get away?
All these pressures that make your head feel so tight

Sometimes it seems easier
To burn it to the ground!

Can we get away now? (now!)
Can we get away now? (now!)
Can we get away now? (now!)
Please, just let this (now!)
Go away...

How much must I live through
Just to get away?
All this tension and so alive
How much must I live through
Just to get away?
All these pressures that make your head feel so tight

Wouldn't it be easier?
Wouldn't it be easier
To get away?

Wouldn't it be easier?
Easier to get away?
