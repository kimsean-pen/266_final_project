Every soul
comes to this earth
carried on angels wings
to human birth.
Born of love
or born of hate
each one is heaven sent
to human fate.

Dream... little girl dream
Dream... little boy dream
dream.

In joy and pain
Each born will grow.
For wisdom is so much more
than what we know.
And every child
will find their way
of living their own life story
day by day.

Dream... little girl dream
Dream... little boy dream
dream.
