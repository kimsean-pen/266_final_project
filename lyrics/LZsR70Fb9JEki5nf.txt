A cinq heures cinquante-cinq
awake with open eyes
a drift upon the night
and miles away from land

five fifty five
five fifty five

a cinq heures cinquante-cinq
ante meridiem
too late to end it now
too early to start again

five fifty five
five fifty five

soon the morning will arrive
can i begin another day
whilst this old day is still alive
refusing to be put away

five fifty five
no sleep tonight
five fifty five

like a beast awaits its faith
laid here with time to kill
the very dead of night
where time and space stand still

five fifty five
five fifty five

a cinq heures cinquante-cinq
nothing will ever change
on the altar of my thought
i sacrifice myself again and again and again

five fifty five
five fifty five
