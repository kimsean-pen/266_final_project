Trying to create something that's not there.
A spark I saw as a bomb is just a means to an end.
And I was just so happy to be out of my shell again,
Don't think that I really cared for who or what.
So for now I'll just have to keep it shut.

If you're not ready, you're not ready.
Please stop acting like you are.

How could I know
That everything you say are lies about devotion and desire?
And I know the spark inside your eyes
Was just the match I used to set myself on fire.

My mouth's shooting blanks.
Situation's unbearable,
I've gotten vulnerable.
Now anyone is free to waltz right in.
My temple's been invaded
And there's nobody guarding it.
All over this lonely life,
But what's so wrong with being all alone?
Alone's the only way I've ever known.

If you're not ready, you're not ready.
Please stop acting like you are.

How could I know
That everything you say are lies about devotion and desire?
And I know the spark inside your eyes
Was just the match I used to set myself on fire.

I'm pleading cause this kills and it's still bleeding.
My darling I'm taking my life back to start healing.

How could I know
That everything you say are lies about devotion and desire?
And I know the spark inside your eyes
Was just the match I used to set myself on fire
