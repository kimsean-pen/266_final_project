Curvy

Woke up with my head okay
To incredible worlds
To the absence of shame
You wanna come
You wanna go
You want it all
You want it now
I've seen your face before it must have been a dream (been a dream)
I've seen your face before

Your body draws me in
Your eyes want danger
Your body draws me in
Your eyes want danger

Must have been a dream (have been a dream)
Must have been (have been a dream)
Must have been a dream (been a dream)
Must have been...

Your body draws me in
Your eyes want danger
Your body draws me in
Your eyes want danger

Let's take a ride along the water, on the wayside
Let's take a ride down by the railroad on the edge of existence
Let's take a ride along the water, on the wayside
