She has followed you from
Where dark water and fortune runs
When your sails come back together
She will follow you where ever you go
But still, rivers run
And running water runs so slow
Had a picture of my mother
But even mother doesn't know
Where big rivers flow
And someday I'd like to know
He has followed you down
Neath starlight and bitter towns
Hard weeds cling to roads that
You ride on your way back home
But still, rivers run
And running water runs so slow
Had a picture of my mother
But even father doesn't know
Where big rivers flow
And someday I'd like to know
