Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

When you're at the end of the road
And it's not the one that you would've chosen
When you're at the end of your rope
And you're holding on, but feel like you're fallin'

With every option exhausted
You've tried everything you know
You saw a light, then you lost it
But there is still hope

Like the fire in the night
Like the ocean parted wide
Like the grave, empty inside
You will see He still does

Miracles, miracles, miracles, miracles
Even if you don't see it now
Without a doubt, He's already moving
There is not a pain that you hold
He doesn't know, and He isn't using

With every option exhausted
You've tried everything you know
So reach for something beyond it
'Cause He is our hope

Like the fire in the night
Like the ocean parted wide
Like the grave empty inside
You will see He still does
Miracles, miracles, miracles, miracles
Miracles, miracles, miracles, miracles

A broken heart can be restored
A broken soul can be reborn
And greater things are still in store
For us, for us

Like the fire in the night
Like the ocean parted wide
Like the grave empty inside
You will see He still does

Miracles, miracles, miracles, miracles
Miracles, miracles (He still does)
Miracles, miracles (He still does)
Miracles, miracles (More than you can dare to dream)
Miracles, miracles (More than you have ever seen)
Miracles, miracles (There's still more, there's still more)
Miracles, miracles (Miracles)

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (Miracles)
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (Miracles)
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
