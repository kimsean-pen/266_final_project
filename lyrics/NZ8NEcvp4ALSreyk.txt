Gaze into her killing jar I'd sometimes stare for hours
(Sometimes stare for hours)
She even poked the holes so I can breathe

She bought the last line
I'm just the worst kind
Of guy to argue
With what you might find
And for the last night I lie
Could I lie with you?

Alright
Give up
Get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright
She wants
It all
To come down this time

(I'm) lost in the prescription
She's got something else in mind
(Something else in mind)
Check into the hotel Bella Muerte

It gives the weak flight
It gives the blind sight
Until the cops come
Or by the last light
And for the last night I lie
Could I lie next to you?

Alright
Give up
Get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright
She wants
It all
To come down this time

Alright
Give up
Get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright
She wants
It all
To come down this time

Pull the plug
But I'd like to learn your name
When holding on
Oh I hope you do the same
Aww sugar
Slip into the tragedy
You've spun this chamber dry

Alright
Give up
Get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright
She wants
It all
To come down this time

Alright
Give up
Get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright
She wants
It all
To come down this time
Pull the plug
But I'd like to learn your name
And holding on
Well I hope you do the same
Aww sugar
