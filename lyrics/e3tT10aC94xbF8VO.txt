Fluffhead was a man
With a horrible disease
Could not find no cure
Wont'cha help him if you please

Fluff came to the door
Asking me for change
His eyes were clear and pure
But his mind was so deranged

Fluff went to a banker
Asking for some bills
The banker said
"I aint got that,
But I sure got some powerful pills"
