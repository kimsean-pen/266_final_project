Jamie's in love
She's got the summer blowing through her hair
She turns it up
She says, "Tonight, you'll take me anywhere"

Bobby's in luck
He's got a fire burning in his eyes
He turns it up
And he says, "Girl, you better hold on tight"

'Cause this is the real thing
Love changes everything
This is night when every heart's exploding
The real thing
Slow down; it's happening
'Cause you got time to burn
In the heat of the moment
That summer radio
Fireworks off the patio
3 AM, string of green lights in a row
And the real thing
Love can change anything
If you can just let go
Let's go

Jamie's alive
She's got it rushin' through her veins tonight
So leave the lights
It feels too good to have to say goodbye

'Cause this is the real thing
Love changes everything
This is night when every heart's exploding
The real thing
Slow down; it's happening
'Cause you got time to burn
In the heat of the moment
That summer radio
Fireworks off the patio
3 AM, string of green lights in a row
And the real thing
Love can change anything
If you can just let go

Can't put the brakes on this runaway train
This is the heartache that won't go away

Jamie's in love
She's got the summer blowing through her hair

'Cause this is the real thing
Love changes everything
This is night when every heart's exploding
The real thing
Slow down; it's happening
'Cause you got time to burn
In the heat of the moment
That summer radio
Fireworks off the patio
3 AM, string of green lights in a row
And the real thing
Love can change anything
If you can just let go
Just let go
Jamie, just let go
