Up close
I was disappearing
Too close
Too imaginary
Can't get
Out enough for looking up
As it comes and goes

How do I
Get it back
Oh really
How do I
Find a song to sing it out loud
If you know I didn't hope that it doesn't show

Chemicals, chemicals, chemicals
I can hear you
Let me go, let me go, let me go
Like i need you
I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong
But i feel you
Chemicals, chemicals, chemicals
When I see you

Unless
You were disappearing
Hopeless
And imaginary
I guess
When it's temporary
Nobody wants to know

How do I
Pull it back
Oh really
How do I
Find a song to sing it out loud
Find a song to sing the words that he doesn't know

Chemicals, chemicals, chemicals
I can hear you
Let me go, let me go, let me go
Like I need you
I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong
But i feel you
Chemicals, chemicals, chemicals
When I see you

Chemicals, chemicals, chemicals
I can hear you
Let me go, let me go, let me go
Like I need you
I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong
But I feel you
Chemicals, chemicals, chemicals
When I see you
