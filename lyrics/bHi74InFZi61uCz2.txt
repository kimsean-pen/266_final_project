Now that you're wasted I think that you should know
I hang out on the baseline, I take it that you know me
Back at my apartment system so I can't afford to be stoned right
They said hey if I'm good I'll take my head smashed to the fridge
Well I wouldn't mind Pepsi Cola, put it to my lips
But surreal, the kids are victims
You know how the peoples talk
I said I should be there but I'm a business man, peace sets out

Hang on, check me boy
Why I don't feel it warm?
Jesus walking down Hollywood boulevard
Under the crown

Take the kids off Broadway
Take the kids off Broadway
Take the kids off Broadway
Take the kids off Broadway now

For a room to grow, the richer lay on
Oh I see

Take the kids off Broadway
Take the kids off Broadway
Take the kids off Broadway
Uh and they'll be sitting in the corner
Take the kids off Broadway now
Uh and they'll be roaring in the bedroom

Yea yea oh

Many years spent walking on the holy water
They never of leaving
He used to sing my song
Many ago, it's just the gold
And I do it all the time
Cause you're just hanging with the center guards
You used to sht to cover me
And I know it was you
