Patterns, they fall, she can hear
And I fold your dress
And I'm wound
I rise in reverence
In the morning light
I pull down the stripes
In the window white
Bar by bar, line by line
In the morning light
She just comes alive
Dissolve at the sight
I see her changing like fire

Show your body of God
All your blonde waves, untamed

These spells, pure hell, dry as bone
And I fold your dress
I howl, I drown in depravity
Heavy fist with no relief

Show your body of God
All your blonde waves, untamed
And after all the patter taunts
The rising heat just breaks and drops
And after all the waterfalls
I love the taste and I can't stop

She floods down hard
Pours from the heavens
Gives it a rest on my chest
She puts on faces everyday
She will always pull the strings
Steal my dreams

Tear my body apart
All your blonde waves, untamed
And after all the patter taunts
The rising heat just breaks and drops
And after all the waterfalls
I love the taste and I can't stop

I want to rattle walls
I want to rattle walls
I want so much more
I want so much more
