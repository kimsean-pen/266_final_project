I'm running out of miracles
(Oh my soul)
And the streets alive with one man shows
(Oh my soul)
The corner boys were moved along
(Oh my soul)
We're plummeting like crippled crows
(Oh my soul)

Oh long before you and I were born
Others beat these benches with their empty cups
To the night and its stars to be here and now and who we are
Another sunrise with my sad captains
With who I choose to lose my mind
And if its so we only pass this way but once
What a perfect waste of time

The BMX apothecary
(Oh my soul)
The architect of infamy
(Oh my soul)
For each and every train we missed
(Oh my soul)
The bitter little Eucharist
(Oh my soul)

Oh long before you and I were born
Others beat these benches with their empty cups
To the night and its stars to the here and now and who we are
Another sunrise with my sad captains
With who I choose to lose my mind
And if its so we only pass this way but once
What a perfect waste of time

Another sunrise with my sad captains
With who I choose to lose my mind
And if its so we only pass this way but once
What a perfect waste of time

Another sunrise with my sad captains
With who I choose to lose my mind
And if its so we only pass this way but once
What a perfect waste of time

What a perfect waste of time
