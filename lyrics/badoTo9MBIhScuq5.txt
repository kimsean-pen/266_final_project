I would never take back
words that I said that
I will always come back to you

Even in the meantime
I will always stand by
a mirror on the shelf

Call you in the nighttime
call you in the daytime
canvas up to you.

'Cause I hope
I never have to take back
said in the night I
that I'll always have all eyes on you
Know that
I'll take what I can when
they said in back, soft
speaking in the dead of night
All eyes on you.

I will never take back
words that I said that
I will always come back to you

Even in the meantime
I will always stand by
a mirror on the shelf

'Cause I hope
I never have to take back
said in the night I
that I'll always have all eyes on you
Know that
I'll take what I can when
they said in back, soft
speaking in the dead of night
All eyes on you.

I hope
I never have to take back
said in the night I
that I'll always have all eyes on you
Know that
I'll take what I can when
they said in back, soft
speaking in the dead of night
All eyes on you

I hope
I never have to take back
said in the night I
that I'll always have all eyes on you
Know that
I'll take what I can when
they said in back, soft
speaking in the dead of night
All eyes on you
Know that
I'll take what I can when
they said in back, soft
speaking in the dead of night
I hope
I never have to take back
said in the night I
that I'll always have all eyes on you
Know that
I'll take what I can when
they said in back, soft
speaking in the dead of night
All eyes on you
Know that
I'll take what I can when
they said in back, soft
speaking in the dead of night
All eyes on you
All eyes on you
All eyes on you
