Baby sometimes i don't understand you
But you're the abstract art in my modern museum
And baby sometimes we fall apart
But the ruins of my heart stands like a coliseum

I hope you die by my side
The two of us at the exact same time
I hope we die not long from now
The two of us at the exact same time

But baby it's all beyond control
But baby you can have my soul
I hope you die by my side
Baby it's all ages away
But I can't help but think of the day
I hope we die at the exact same time

Baby your love is bigger than a football field
I'm the hooligan of your heart
Sometimes we win but sometimes we lose our dreams
But I always wear the colours of your team

I hope you die by my side
The two of us at the exact same time
I hope we die not long from now
The two of us at the exact same time

Baby you're the coolest moon when the night's begun
And I'm a goth in the sun
And you can sleep through the summer days
I know you think I'm morbid when I say

I hope you die by my side
The two of us at the exact same time
I hope we die not long from now
The two of us at the exact same time
Baby I hope you die right by my side...
Baby I hope we die at the exact same time...
