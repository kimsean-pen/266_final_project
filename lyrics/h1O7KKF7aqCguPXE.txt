Tonight I'll wait for you,
The raindrops are falling,
The kindle is burning,
For you, I'll be waiting here.

If all of the days, have no more light,
And all of our dreams are lost tonight,
The stars cannot fall,
And everything turns to grey,
I will stay.

Graceful and loving
Tearful and soothing
Can't breathe without you,
There's no life without you here.

If all of the days have no more light,
And all of our dreams are lost tonight,
The stars cannot fall,
And everything turns to grey,
I will stay.

Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.

If all of our days have no more light,
And all of our dreams to lost tonight,
The stars cannot fall,
And everything turns to grey

If all of our days have turned to night,
And all of our dreams are lost in lies,
The stars cannot fall,
And everything turns to grey,
I will stay.
