Speak your mind
I just closed
Off my insides
Following, taking me
Where you're leading

I've come to see
This is me
What I need's
In front of me
Never to
To be free
Free from what you bring

Why do I follow
Letting you in front of me
To steal tomorrow, morrow
Yeah

Free my mind
In due time
I'll break this from me
Fear inside
I can't rewind
From the ending

I've come to see
This is me
What I need's
In front of me
Never to
To be free
Free from what you bring

Why do I follow
Letting you in front of me
To steal tomorrow

Why should I follow
Letting you overcome me
To steal tomorrow

Never to be free
Never to be free
Never to be me

Why do I follow
Letting you in front of me
To steal tomorrow

Why should I follow
Letting you overcome me
To steal tomorrow, morrow, morrow

Let me go
(never wanna be this, never wanna be this)
Let me go
(never wanna be this, never wanna be this)
Let me go
(never gonna be this, never gonna be this)
Let me go
(never gonna be this, never gonna be this)
