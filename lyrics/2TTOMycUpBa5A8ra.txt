More than you know
More than you know
Lately I find
You're on my mind
More than you know

Whether I'm right
Whether I'm wrong
I need you so
More than you know
More than you know

Loving you
The way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
And the little bit of love
That I get may be all
That you can give
But I can't live without it

Oh how I cry
Oh how I cry

If you got tired
And said goodbye
More than I'd show
More than you'd ever, ever know
More than you know

More than you'd ever, ever know
More than you know
