Better wake up before it's all gone
Better wake up before it's all gone

Half wrapped in a leopard print sex swing
The beat is shit and I'm 'bout to make a new slang
If your momma was a bed of kites, then we could fly away
And fuck this night right

I feel the brick wall hit
You've never been me before
I feel the will I trick
Self-deprecation to settle the score

Here comes the reaper to erase what I've become
I won't be plastic and neutered and numb
I won't be plastic and neutered and numb
I won't be plastic and neutered and numb

I couldn't help it made me wonder
If you're the weight that pulled us under
All of it was make believe
All of it was make believe

And now I'm pulling back the covers
Thought I could trust you like no other
All of it was make believe
All of it was make believe

Deception

Cordial graces, smiling faces, back and forth
Antiquated, overrated, social whores
I don't need you
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you
I don't need you anymore

And there's a code for people like you
Always keeping score
And you will never make me like you
Because I'm colder than before

You made me this way
You made me this way

Pay your debt, don't suffocate
If you're making it, don't eat the cake
If you're faking it, then show 'em bait
Don't be so disgusting

Like wind on the wick
I see the symptoms inside of your binges
I checked that you weren't dead
I check then I got sucked in

I couldn't help it made me wonder
If you're the weight that pulled us under
All of it was make believe
All of it was make believe

And now I'm pulling back the covers
Thought I could trust you like no other
All of it was make believe
All of it was make believe

Deception
