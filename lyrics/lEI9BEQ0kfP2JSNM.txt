So really... I have to stunt on everyone...

'Cos this is my comfort zone
Light the spliff
Inhale
It's healing me
Take a hit
Take a hit, let it chill
I arrive as me
Hello, I'm Dee

Calmer me...
A calmer me,
I come back a calmer me

The spliff is good, its healing me
What would you do for love

Paradise
Is what I like
But I gotta have a spliff oh
Right by my side
Take a hike
Go some far place
Away from here
Away from fuckery
Common ideas

Do you ever, do you ever feel
Like nothing nothing
Nothing, nothings fuckin' real
How the fuck you light sage
And your aura smell shit
Ooh...
Let it chill
Ooh...
Let it chill, that's cute

This is the intro to urban jazz
Sorry baby every time I smell loud

Killing me softly
Eu falo portuges tamb√©m
Pela primeira ves
For the first time I'm breathing in years
Ooh...
Let it chill
Tanto amor na minha vida
Ooh...
