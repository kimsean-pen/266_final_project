You're what I want
You're what I need
Give me your love
Make me a freak

I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore

You're sent like stars
It's well divine
I want your love
All of the time

I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore

Connect me
Over the other side
Connect me
Over the other side

Your strange music
Like lucid dreams
The power of you
Transforming me

I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore

I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait anymore

Connect me
Over the other side
Connect me
Over the other side

I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
