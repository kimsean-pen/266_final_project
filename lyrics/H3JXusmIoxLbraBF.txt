Hey, what's on your mind?
Hey, what's that got left behind?
Tension running, how? What for?
Don't think I'm into you anymore

Falling off the pace
Run into you 'most every place
And I hardly go outside
Let's take a little ride

I don't know, man, you decide
How'd you pin that one on me?
Haven't even done it yet
How can that be?

My move or do I chuck it?
Stare it in the face or duck it
Get me a bucket I disappear I would agree

That's a distinct possibility
Wrap my leg around the table
I'll make a trip when I'm more stable

Gotta cut that one leg free
Hobblin' around, hold out for me
I'll leave the house when I'm less scared
Don't make me go, I'm not prepared

Hey, what's on your mind?
Hey, what's that got left behind?
Was it me you saved that for?
What's down at the core?

Hey, I seen that look before
Weren't you using that on me?
Do you slap that glaze
On every guy you see?

My move or do I chuck it?
Stare it in the face or duck it
Get me a bucket

I don't know why you see me
I don't know a thing to be
My move or do I chuck it?
Stare it in the face or duck it
Get me a bucket
