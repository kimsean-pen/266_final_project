Born in
Is the sin

Should I
Be good for others

Machines creating death
Death seas, acid rain

War
Everywhere I look

Murdering
Is the pleasure of human

They're not afraid of the underworld
TORMENTOR
They think that this world is the
TORMENTOR

Satisfaction
In the dirty rubbish

Death wish
Has arrived

Machines creating death
Death seas, acid rain

This world is really necrophilia and
TORMENTOR
In days this world will fall in deadly
TORMENTOR
