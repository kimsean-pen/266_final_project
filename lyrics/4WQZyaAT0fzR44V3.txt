Just another loaded question
If we go
And I'm tryina find an answer
To please us both
What tales then I see
To let you go
I'm not playing some game
You're the one I choose

When you have a second doubt
Don't you worry bout, worry bout us
When shots are ringing out
Don't you worry bout, worry bout us
When you have a second doubt
Don't you worry bout, worry bout us
Don't you worry bout, worry bout us

All the words you leave unspoken
Love it up
Because you go there this is broken
In all we've got
To fear before to let go
Give your promise
We're all wonderful
When it comes to love

When you have a second doubt
Don't you worry bout, worry bout us
When shots are ringing out
Don't you worry bout, worry bout us
When you have a second doubt
Don't you worry bout, worry bout us
Don't you worry bout, worry bout us
