I was justified when I was five
Raising cain I spit in your eye
Times are changing now the poor get fat
But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back
Oh-oh-oh

Eat meat on a friday that's alright
Even like steak on a saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I'm a bitch I'm a bitch
Oh the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch I can bitch
'Cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do
Oh-oh-oh

I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul by dropping names
I don't like those my god what's that
Oh it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back
(oh-oh-oh)

I'm a bitch I'm a bitch
Oh the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch I can bitch
'Cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do
Oh-oh-oh
(oh-oh-oh)

I'm a bitch I'm a bitch
Oh the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch I can bitch
'Cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do
Oh-oh-oh
Bitch bitch
Bitch is back
Bitch bitch
Bitch is back
(oh-oh-oh)
Bitch bitch
Bitch is back
(oh-oh-oh)
Bitch bitch
Bitch is back
(oh-oh-oh)

Bitch is back
(oh-oh-oh)

(oh-oh-oh)
