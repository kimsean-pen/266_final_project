He's a perfect stranger
Like a cross of himself and a fox
He's a feeling arranger
And a changer of the way he talks

Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner

If you see him in the subway
He'll be down at the end of the car
Watching you move
Until he knows, he knows who you are

Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner

There was a woman he knew
About a year or so ago
On the day that she left
He died but it did not show

Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner
