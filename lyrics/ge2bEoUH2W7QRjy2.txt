Way up there
They think they found
A world for us
To settle down
And I know now
We failed somehow
Pick my feet
Up from the ground
The hills have rolled into the clouds
And callous faces
Line the alleyways
Where I long for you
It is no revolution
See
It always has been you and me
In the garden in the photo
Trying to find common ground
And she sings to me
When I'm wound
"Lovely sound
Rows away
We can love this sound
Goes away"
Way up there
They think they found
A world for us
To settle down
And I know now
We failed somehow
Pick my feet
Up from the ground
The hills have rolled into the clouds
And callous faces
Line the alleyways
Where I long for you
(Rode for long to you)?
It is no revolution
See
It always has been you and me
In the garden in the photo
Trying to find common ground
And she sings to me
When I'm round
"We found lovely sound
Rows away
We can love this sound
Goes away"
