Too many thoughts on my mind I can't sleep at night, so I just keep writing
I don't need no help I don't need opinions so don't waste my time then
I just been livin online, my city don't show me no love and that's fine
Fuck local radio stations, I got more plays than all of these rappers combined
I'm goin I'm goin again I been goin in
I'm fed up with so many things
I gotta just let it all out
I'm talkin about
The shit they been talkin about
Tellin me I should do this
Tellin me I should do that
Tellin me tellin me things about rap
Talkin the truth and then stabbin my back
They won't knock me off track no no
Too many things have been building, been hard to deal with, I just been drinking
Remember my moves in the past, I'm wondering what was I thinkin
Lately I'm livin in fear
Wondering what if the end is so near
All of the shit goin on
The shootings are strong
One shot to the head and I'm gone
I'm losing control but I can't let it go
Cuz I'm tryna get more and I been in the moment
I been in the zone and I'm moving alone
I don't pick up the phone when my family call
I've been doin it wrong and I don't know what's happenin
Tryna get what I just been imagining
Gettin close and I just been examining
All of the fake shit the game has been packaging
I been keepin real
I been doin what I feel
I been out here tryna kill
Every beat I know I will
Everything Im working on
Every night another song
They been quiet all along
They gon notice when I'm gone
I come from a town where most of the people are so closed minded
They goin to school and they workin a job but they don't even like it
I won't be put in a box
Nobody tellin me what I should rock
Nobody tellin what I should drop cuz i do what I want and just know I don't stop
Recordin till 4 morning they snoring I'm pouring my soul into every story
I'm writing producin I mix it and master I'm building my craft and I'm not lookin back
I been goin doin things I wanna do when I want to
Everybody wanna get a win but they not due
Everybody wanna copy you but they not you
Everybody wanna be cool but they not new
Woah
Look how I go
Gon be a dentist I still got the flow
Never gon lose cuz I'm still doin both
Never gon lose cuz I been on a roll
Come to ya state and I'm killin the show
Know that I'm young and I still gotta grow
Know that I'm workin the most
No I'm never gon choke and I'm lookin back down on the people below
I been keepin real
I been doin what I feel
I been out here tryna kill
Every beat I know I will
Everything Im working on
Every night another song
They been quiet all along
They gon notice when I'm gone
