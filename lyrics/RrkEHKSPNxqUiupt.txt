They promised this would be our home
They led us here, to rest our hearts

A shelter for the future born
To embrace peace and harvest hope

Divided from the ones we love
We saw them slay what we adore

The soil is dry, the water foul
There's only past where I came from

The ones we leave are left behind in need

For all I had, vanished
My hands will burn your walls

This is who I am, fallen
An icon of the loss

For all the fire
For all the fire

The sanctions that you force on us
Asphyxiate the overcome

Despair is built within our house
Breeding the weak to feed the strong

The thoughts you feed, you can't restrain
They'll turn to you
ANd be your bane

For all I had, vanished
My hands will burn your walls

This is who I am, fallen
Commander of the lost
For all the fire
For all the fire

The walls are higher,
fields are burning and my dreams are all there is
The light is blinding, no prayers answered for salvation never came
