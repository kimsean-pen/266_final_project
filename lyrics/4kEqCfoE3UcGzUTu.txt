I've put myself, await the
I'm pushing off beyond life
I've put myself, await the
I'm pushing off beyond life

The spiral down, you're coming back the day
And again, and again and again and again
These friends of ours, they seem pretend
Again and again and again and again and again, yeah

I've put myself, await the
I'm pushing off beyond life
I've put myself, await the
I'm pushing off beyond life

It's cultural disease to see the life
So I want you out ...

Cause I want you, I want you, out
Cause I want you, I want you, out
Cause I want you, I want you, out
Cause I want you, I want you, out
