Starting something
Thought could be fun
Started something
Couldn't go on

Danger, heartache
I always knew
There's no winner
In this game you lose

But I still wanna know
How she got in the door uninvited?

Ohh, I got a rocket
Ohh, you're going on it
Ohh, you're never coming back

Cliches, secrets
Stories unfold
Fooled by passion
Losing control

Danger, heartache
Something has died
No good pretending
I'm leaving this time

But I still wanna know
How she got in the door uninvited?

Ohh, I got a rocket
Ohh, you're going on it
Ohh, you're never coming back

Ohh, I got a rocket
Ohh, you're going on it
Ohh, you're never coming back

You're never coming back
You're never coming back again, no, no
You're going out on your own

You're never coming back
You're never coming back again, oh no
You're going out on your own

Ohh, I got a rocket
Ohh, you're going on it
Ohh, you're never coming back

Ohh, I got a rocket
Ohh, you're going on it
Ohh, you're never coming back
You're never coming back
