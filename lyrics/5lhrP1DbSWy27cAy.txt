I used to be tryna be perfect in every way
I used to care about what people say
I never questioned being on picket fences
I'm not afraid about where I fit into the frame
Satisfied to drive in my own lane
So quit denying, yesterday is dying

I'll never be
I'll never be
All of the things that you need me to be
You'll never see
You'll never see
That version of me

I'm not the girl in the white dress
I'm not your fairytale princess
I'm sorry, mama, that I made you cry
Some day you'll know the reason why

I'm not the girl in the white dress
I'm impressing my darkness
I'm really sorry that I let you down
But I'm still gonna make you proud

Close your eyes
Why don't you try to keep an open mind?
I hope you know how hard I really tried
It might be a hard truth but it's not about you
This is mine so don't treat me like I'm a crime
My life, my lesson learned in time
Don't need against you
You don't have to be you

You'll never see, you'll never see
That version of me

I'm not the girl in the white dress
I'm not your fairytale princess
I'm sorry, mama, that I made you cry
Some day you'll know the reason why

I'm not the girl in the white dress
I'm impressing my darkness
I'm really sorry that I let you down
But I'm still gonna make you proud

I'll never be, I'll never be
All of the things that you need me to be

I'm not the girl in the white dress
I'm not your fairytale princess
I'm sorry, mama, that I made you cry
Some day you'll know the reason why

I'm not the girl in the white dress
I'm impressing my darkness
I'm really sorry that I let you down
But I'm still gonna make you proud
