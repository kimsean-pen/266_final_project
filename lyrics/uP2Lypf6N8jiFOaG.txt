I was born in a valley of bricks
Where the river runs high above the rooftops.
I was waiting for the cars coming home late at night -
From the Dutch mountains.

I was standing in a valley of rock
Up to my belly in an early fog.
I was looking for the road to a green painted house -
In the Dutch mountains.
In the Dutch mountains
- mountains -.

I met a woman in a valley of stone

She was painting roses on the walls of her home.
And the moon is a coin with the head of the queen -
Of the Dutch mountains; in the Dutch mountains.

I lost a button of my shirt today

It fell on the ground and it was rolling away.
Like a trail leading me back to the Dutch mountains

To the Dutch mountains, mountains

I met a miller on the back of a cow

He was looking for the wind
but he didn't know how.
I said: "Follow the cloud that looks like a sheep"
In the Dutch mountains
in the Dutch mountains

In the Dutch mountains
in the Dutch mountains.
