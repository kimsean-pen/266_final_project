No, no, I, I, I, I, I don't want to break when I speak
I don't want to shake while I'm standing
I don't want to crawl into another hole
I don't know what I'm hiding for
No, I, I, I, I, I don't want to fall when I stand
I don't want to have to hold your hand
I just want to be the girl I used to be when I was me and worry free
And I know these burdens are my own

But I can't keep on running
No, I just can't keep on running away from here
I know that the only way to beat it is to fight my every fear
I'm not gonna make it 'til I turn around and face it alone, I know
That I can't keep on running, no I just can't keep on running away
So it stops today

So here I am, I'm taking my first step
Thought I was losing balance but I caught myself
I kind of like the challenge, no I don't need help
I am gonna make it past the very start
It's always been my hardest part

But I, I, I, I, I am gonna stay in control
I must admit this crutch is getting old
I am gonna throw it out of my hand
I'm finally here, I understand
I know I'll get there on my own

So I can't keep on running
No, I just can't keep on running away from here
I know that the only way to beat it is to fight my every fear
I'm not gonna make it 'til I turn around and face it alone, I know
That I can't keep on running, no I just can't keep on running away
So it stops today

You can hide from all the pain
But it will find you anyway
Yes, I know
Now I know

That I can't keep on running
No, I just can't keep on running away from here
I know that the only way to beat it is to fight my every fear
I'm not gonna make it 'til I turn around and face it alone, I know
That I can't keep on running, no I just can't keep on running away
So it stops today!
