Heard about the party now
Just east of Harlem
Dougie's gonna b there
But you got to call him

Even the soldiers
Need a break sometimes
Listen to the groove ya'll
Let it unwind your mind

No intoxication
Unless you see what I see
Dancin' hot n' sweaty
Right in font of me

Call it what u like
I'm gonna call it how it be
This is just another one
Of God's gifts
Musicology

Keep that party movin'
Just like I told you
Kick the old school joint
for the true funk soldiers
Musicology

Wish I had a dollar
for every time you say
Don't you miss the feeling
Music gave ya
Back in the day?

Let's Groove
September
Earth, Wind and Fire
Hot Pants by James
Sly's gonna take you higher

Minor keys and drugs
Don't make a rollerskate jam
Take your pick - turntable or a band?

If it ain't Chuck D
or Jam Master Jay
Know what?
They're losin'
'Cause we got a PhD in
Advanced Body Movin'

Keep the party movin'
Just like I told you
Kick the old school joint
For the true funk soldiers
