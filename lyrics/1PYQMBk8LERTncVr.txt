Baby please don't stop

Something's taking
Over my heart
Caught me in the
Moment of weakness
Boy you had me from the start
Now all I wanna taste
Is your sweetness

So what's the point
In trying to fight it
You've got me in the
Palm of your hand

You can shake me down
You can wind me up
You can drive me crazy
Baby please don't stop
I'm going out of my head
Need to feel your love
Boy, too much can
Never be enough
So, baby please don't stop

Oh, baby please don't stop
Baby please don't stop
Oh, baby please don't stop

Something's taking
Over my mind
And that's a place that
I've never been to
I'm not the infatuation kind
But it happened from
The moment I met you

So what's the point in
Trying to fight it
I want you more
Than I can stand

You can shake me down
You can wind me up
You can drive me crazy
Baby please don't stop
I'm going out of my head
Need to feel your love
Boy, too much can
Never be enough
So, baby please don't stop

Further I fall, the
Deeper I'm in
The more I lose it,
The more I win
So, baby please don't stop
Oh, baby please don't stop
You can shake me down
You can wind me up
Oh, baby please don't stop
Going out of my head
Feel your love

You can shake me down
You can wind me up
You can drive me crazy
Baby please don't stop
I'm going out of my head
Need to feel your love
Boy, too much can
Never be enough
So, baby please don't stop

Oh, baby please don't stop
Baby please don't stop
Oh, baby please don't stop
