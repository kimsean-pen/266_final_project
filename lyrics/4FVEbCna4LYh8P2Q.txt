Give it to me
I must have it
Precious treasure
I deserve it

Where can I run?
How can I hide?
The Silmarils
Gems of treelight

Their life belongs to me
Oh, it's sweet
How the darkness is floating around

We are following
The will of the one
Through the dark age
And into the storm

And we are following
The will of the one
Through the dark age
And into the storm
Lord, I'm mean

Black heart show me
What you hold in your hand
I still hunger for more
Release me from my pain

Give it to me
How I need it
How I need it
How I need it

Where can I run?
How can I hide?
The Silmarils
Gems of treelight

Their life belongs to me
Oh, it's sweet
How the darkness is floating around

We are following
The will of the one
Through the dark age
And into the storm

And we are following
The will of the one
Through the dark age
And into the storm
Lord, I'm mean

I did my part
Now it's your turn
And remember
What you've promised

Where can I run?
How can I hide?
The Silmarils
Gems of treelight

Their life belongs to me
Oh, it's sweet
How the darkness is floating around

We are following
The will of the one
Through the dark age
And into the storm

And we are following
The will of the one
Through the dark age
And into the storm
Lord, I'm mean
