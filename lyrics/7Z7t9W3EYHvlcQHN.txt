your eyes make eric swallow
a drop of freezing sweat
his naked skin will bury
your secret left unsaid
a boy like you is precious
he knows it like the rest
the camera lens is ice cold
lick eric's hairy breast

legs-torso-bleeding soul
tight, let his fear evolve

you crak him out of love
you're running through the wild
hunter on the fumes
tar heart man
it's buried with his soul
fast running through the woods
and leave like it is

your finger by his lining
the dirty motel sleeps
bites down on leather, wining
knows what your dark eyes keeps
the look of love is lethal
and eric starts to cry
looks like a trembling beetle
make him prepared to die

legs-torso-bleeding soul
tight, let his fear evolve

you crak him out of love
you're running through the wild
hunter on the fumes
tar heart man
it's buried with his soul
fast running through the woods
and leave it like it is

his picture on the screen
give eric blue bashed skin
green eyes turn into pitch black
as he devotes to sin
your fist will bury itself
like knife in stomach, deep
and eric's eyes will fade out
run faster, leave him, leap

legs-torso-bleeding soul
tight, let his fear evolve

you crak him out of love
you're running through the wild
hunter on the fumes
tar heart man
it's buried with his soul
fast running through the woods
and leave it like it is

(easy to carve out lonely hearts,
bodies freeze faster in the night)

tar heart man
it's pounding in your chest
you're running through the woods
and leave it like it is
