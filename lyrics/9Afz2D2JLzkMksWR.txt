Does he love me I want to know
How can I tell if he Loves me so
(Is it in his eyes?)
Oh no! You'll be deceived
(Is it in his sighs?)
Oh no! He'll make believe
If you want to know if he Loves you so It's in his Kiss
(That's where it is Oh Ya or Is it in his face?)
Oh no! That's just his charms
(In his warm embrace?)
Oh no! That's just his arms
If you want to know if he Loves you so It's in his Kiss
(That's where it is)
Whoa, It's in his Kiss
(That's where it is)

Whoa, hug him and squeeze him tight
Find out what you want to know
If it's Love, if it really is
It's there in his Kiss

(How about the way he acts)
Oh no! That's not the way
And you're not list'nin' to all I say
If you wanna know if he Loves you so
It's in his Kiss
(That's where it is)
Whoa, It's in his Kiss
(That's where it is)

Whoa... hug him and squeeze him tight
Find out what you want to know
If it's Love, if it really is
It's there in his Kiss

(How about the way he acts)
Oh no! That's not the way
And you're not listnin' to all I say
If you wanna know if he Loves you so
It's in his Kiss
(That's where it is)

Whoa, It's in his Kiss
(That's where it is)
Ah Ya It's in his Kiss
(That's where it is)

Ooh, It's in his Kiss
That's where it is
It's in his Kiss
That's where it is
Ooh, It's in his Kiss

Ooh, ah it is Kiss
Whoa oh it's in the Kiss
It's in his Kiss
That's where it is
