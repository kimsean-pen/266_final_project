Maybe I'm wrong, you decide
Should I've been strong, yet I lied
Nobody gets me like you

Couldn't keep hold of you then
How could I know what you meant
There was not friend to compare to

There's a mountain between us
But there's one thing I'm sure of
That I know how I feel about you

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I've let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

All that it takes one more chance
Don't let our next kiss be our last
I'm out of my mind just to show you

I know everything changes
I don't care where it takes us
'Cause I know how I feel about you

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I've let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

Not a day passed me by
Not a day passed me by
When I don't think about you

And there's no moving on
'Cause I know you're the one
And I can't be without you

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I've let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I've let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

But I know how I feel about you now
Yeah, I know how I feel about you now
