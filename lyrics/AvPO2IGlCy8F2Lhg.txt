I've seen gypsies who made it all the way
And kept going, kept rolling with nowhere to go
Nowhere to go.

As far as I've seen from the bush
In the wilderness, to every known city
I've been to Saudi Arabia, Dhaka, Calcutta
Soweto, Mozambique, Istanbul, Rio, Rome
Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Taiwan, Great Britain
Belfast, to the desert, Spain,
Some little bitty island in the middle of the Pacific
All the way back home, to my town
To my town
Bitching, complaining when some ṗeople who ain't got shit to eat
Bitching, moaning, so many people you know they got

What are we doing?
We're sitting on a ruin
What are we doing?
We're sitting on a ruin
