Boy meets girl
You were my dream, my world
But I was blind
You cheated on me from behind
So on my own
I feel so all alone
Though i know it's true
I'm still in love with you

I need a miracle
I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see
That you are made for me
I need a miracle
Please let me be your girl
One day you'll see it can happen to me
I need a miracle
I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see
That you are made for me
I need a miracle
Please let me be your girl
One day you 'll see it can happen to me

It can happen to me

Miracle

Day and night
I'm alway by your side
Cause i know for sure
My love is real my feeling's pure
So take a try

No need to ask me why
Cause I know it's true
I'm in love with you

I need a miracle
I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see
That you are made for me
I need a miracle please let me be your girl
One day you'll see it can happen to me
I need a miracle
I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see
That you are made for me
I need a miracle
Please let me be your girl
One day you'll see it can happen to me
It can happen to me
