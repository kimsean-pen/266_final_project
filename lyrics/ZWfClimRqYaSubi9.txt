Loving you has thrown me
Loving you is lonely
Loving you is lonely

Oh, you can swagger
You can gather attention
But I'm sick of your photographs
I'm so sick of your photographs
Oh, you can chatter
And you can talk me to nothing
But I'm tired of being your sweetheart
I'm tired of being your sweetheart

Loving you has thrown me
You have been my only rock on the ground
Now that I'm out of sight
Loving you is lonely
Loving you is lonely

I don't wanna a baby
That I beg and that I borrow
And I don't wanna follow you
I'm just too proud to follow you
You don't wanna a baby
Gonna have to go tomorrow
You're better be missing me
You're better be missing me
You're better be missing me now

Loving you has thrown me
You have been my only rock on the ground
Now that I'm out of sight
Loving you is lonely
Loving you is lonely, lonely, lonely
Loving you is lonely
Loving you has thrown me

You're better be missing me
You're better be missing me
You're better be missing me
You're better be missing me now
You're better be missing me now
You're better be missing me now
You're better be missing me now
