So young, so bold, to be ignored
How come I'm yours and can't be heard?
You're flooding our fire with your words
So I'm treading in water and still it burns

So tell me what it feels to be you right now
'Cause I won't let go of you somehow
Love me like you never had a doubt
And I'll love you even though you let me down

My love, a canyon's come between us
A river tore right through us
I swear I can't feel you anymore
Don't you want me anymore?
My love

I'm calling your name out, my voice echoes
So distant, deserted like a desert rose
The rapids are running over us
Still hoping you're hoping we find the sun

So tell me what it feels to be you right now
'Cause I won't let go of you somehow
Love me like you never had a doubt
And I'll love you even though you let me down
