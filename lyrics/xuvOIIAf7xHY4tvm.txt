So this is permanence - love's shattered pride
What once was innocence, turned on its side
Grey cloud hangs over me - marks every move
Deep in the memory, what once was love

Oh how I realised how I wanted time
Put into perspective - tried so hard to find
Just for one moment I thought I'd found my way
Destiny unfolded - I watched it slip away

Excessive flashpoints - beyond all reach
Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep
Let's take a ride out - see what we can find
A valueless collection of hopes and past desires

I never realised the lengths I'd have to go
All the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know
Just for one moment I heard somebody call
Looked beyond the day in hand - there's nothing there at all

Now that I've realised how it's all gone wrong
Got to find some therapy - this treatment takes too long
Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway
Got to find my destiny before it gets too late
