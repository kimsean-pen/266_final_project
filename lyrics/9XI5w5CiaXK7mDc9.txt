Who gives a fuck about my nightmares?
'Cause I can barely focus when I'm like this
And lately, forty wings would be just priceless
I wrestle with myself and with my vices
But no one gives a fuck about my nightmares

But it's nothing you should worry yourself about (oh oh, oh oh)
It's nothing you should worry yourself about (oh oh, oh ohhh)

It's all a bit of fun until somebody gets hurt
I'll take it with a pinch of salt, another lesson learned
But I don't need to know what's real or not no more
I don't need to know what's real or not no more

Who gives a fuck about my nightmares?
No use in moaning when they're right there
Face down on my pillow 'cause tonight there's no surprises
You go ahead and get some sleep I'll take the night shift
No one gives a fuck about my nightmares

But it's nothing you should worry yourself about (oh oh, oh oh)
It's nothing you should worry yourself about (oh oh, oh ohhh)

It's all a bit of fun until somebody gets hurt
I'll take it with a pinch of salt, another bridge is burned
But I don't need to know what's real or not no more
I don't need to know what's real or not no more

Yeah
And now my best friends belling me like
(Hi) Hello (Hi) Hello (Hi)
What's your movements tonight?
Are you feeling alright, should we try and get a little bit
(Hi) Hello (Hello) Lemons (Hi)
I've never been so tired and lately I don't feel quite right

But It's nothing you should worry yourself about (oh oh, oh oh)
It's nothing you should worry yourself about (oh oh, oh ohhh)

It's all a bit of fun until somebody gets hurt
I'll take it with a pinch of salt, another lesson learned
But I don't need to know what's real or not no more
I don't need to know what's real or not no more

Everybody on the late-night shift
Everybody on a drinking crisis
Ain't nobody wanna feel like this
Everybody on the late-night shift
Everybody on the brink of crisis
No one gives a fuck about my nightmares
But it's nothing you should worry yourself about
