O Beautiful Day!
There's mosquitoes about!
If they're not sucking
They're spitting my blood out
Follow the virus
It's a bird in it's nest
It's just doing what it does best
What Isn't Nature
Love is
Vengeance is
The overdosed hippie girl
in the port-o-potty is
Sure, there is plenty
of ugly things around
But that does not mean
There is no common ground
What isn't Nature
There is a nature to all things
There's nothing wrong with love
Have some humility
