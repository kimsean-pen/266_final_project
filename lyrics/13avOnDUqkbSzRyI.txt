I'm touching a secret
He's asking forgiveness
Tell me your pain
Is it haunting you now?
Fourteen years and it's crumbling down

You gotta be strong boy
You gotta be tough
Don't you know you're a man?
Anyone could have played ya
Weakness won't be your saviour

They said it's innocence
Cast out the devil sins
Don't wanna come between
You and her, keep arguing
I'll remember everything, I

I dreamed of a life so big and tall
An escape from who I was
And our past is going up in flames
And the future can be rearranged

Oh, and we're dancing to the sound
Of your demons falling down
And our past is going up in flames (flames)
And the future will be rearranged

She's got a new life, you know
She's happier, but she wonders, what now?
Is all of this pain what I wanted?
The branches of me are distorted

They said it's innocence
Cast out the devil sins
Don't wanna come between
You and her, keep arguing
I'll remember everything, I

I dreamed of a life so big and tall
An escape from who I was
And our past is going up in flames
And the future can be rearranged

Oh, and we're dancing to the sound
Of your demons falling down
And our past is going up in flames
And the future will be rearranged

I dreamed of a life so big and tall
An escape from who I was
And our past is going up in flames
And the future can be rearranged

Oh, and we're dancing to the sound
Of your demons falling down
And our past is going up in flames
And the future will be rearranged
