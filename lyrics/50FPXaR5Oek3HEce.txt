I think I hate you
I really do
Think I can feel it coming off me
You're not the person
I thought I knew
And now I'm left here feeling nothing
Put your white flag up, white flag up
Put your white flag up
Put your white flag up, white flag up
Put your white flag up
Put your white flag up, white flag up
Put your white flag up
Put your white flag up, white flag up
Put your white flag up
'Cause I liked you better before I loved you
I liked you better before, before
'Cause I liked you better before I loved you
I liked you better before, before
Put your, put your, put your white flag up
Put your white flag up now
Put your, put your, put your white flag up
Put your white flag up now
Put your, put your, put your white flag up
Put your white flag up now
Put your, put your, put your white flag up
Put your white flag up
I think I'm stupid
I really do
'Cause I think your actions do the talking
But you just keep threatening
The way you do
To bring us back to where we started
Put your white flag up, white flag up
Put your white flag up,
Put your white flag up, white flag up
Put your white flag up
'Cause I liked you better before I loved you
I liked you better before, before
'Cause I liked you better before I loved you
I liked you better before, before
Put your, put your, put your white flag up
Put your white flag up, now
Put your, put your, put your white flag up
Put your white flag up, now
Put your, put your, put your white flag up
Put your white flag up, now
Put your, put your, put your white flag up
Put your white flag up, now
Put it up, put it up, up
Put it up, put it up, up
Save me, save me
Surrender, put it up, up
I know you want to
Put it up, put it up, up
Save me, save me
Put it up, put it up, up
Surrender I need you to
I need you to
'Cause I liked you better before I loved you
I liked you better before, before
'Cause I liked you better before I loved you
I liked you better before, before
Put your, put your, put your white flag up
Put your white flag up, now
Put your, put your, put your white flag up
Put your white flag up, now
Put your, put your, put your white flag up
Put your white flag up, now
Put your, put your, put your white flag up
I think I hate you
