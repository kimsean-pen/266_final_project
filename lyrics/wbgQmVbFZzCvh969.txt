Wheels keep rolling
Sirens howling
in the desert
in the desert
You're on the backseat of my car
in a dream we're gonna watch the stars
in a new place
in a new place

We lost track, it doesn't matter
cause we are on this road together

Let's start a fire, a fire
new kids coming into town
lets get together
we take over now

A fire, a fire
new kids coming into town
lets get together
we take over now

Stakes were high, the rise and fall
no more lies, leave it all
in the desert
in the desert
Change the world, paint the place
bring a toast to peace and grace
in a new place
in a new place

We lost track, it doesn't matter
cause we are on this road together

Let's start a fire, a fire
new kids coming into town
lets get together
we take over now

A fire, a fire
new kids coming into town
lets get together
we take over now

We are on this road together
We are on this road together
We are on this road together
We are on this road together

Let's start a fire, a fire
new kids coming into town
lets get together
we take over now

A fire, a fire
new kids coming into town
lets get together
we take over now

A fire, a fire
new kids coming into town
lets get together
we take over now
