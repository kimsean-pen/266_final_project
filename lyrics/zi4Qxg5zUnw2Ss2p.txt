No more timing each tear
That falls from my eyes
I'm not hiding the remedy
To cure this old heart of mine

I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

Moving sidewalks
I don't see under my feet
Climbing up from down here below
Where the streets see me lonely for you

I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

I can dream about you
I'm gonna press my lips against you
And hold you tight to me
I can dream about you
You know you got me spellbound
What else can it be

Moving sidewalks
I don't see under my feet
Climbing up from the pain in my heart
'Cause it's you that I need

I can dream
Whoa, oh, I can dream
Yes, I can dream
Whoa, oh

I don't understand it
I can't keep my mind off loving you
(Not even for a minute)
Ooo, now baby, I'm caught up
In the magic I see in you
There's one thing to do

I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right
Whoa, oh

I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
Oh, I can dream
I can dream

I can dream about you
Oh, I can dream about you
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right
