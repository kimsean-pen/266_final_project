You think you see the world I'll tell you nothing's how it seems
You think you see the world I'll tell you nothing's how it seems
Organ of intuition suppressed and maimed
Believed to be "Nothing but a Dream"
Dymethylated spirits on fire in me
Burning from the inside
Divorce from nature exile from Eden
Confounding of tongues in a world full of lies
Why can't we open our eyes?
You think you see the world I'll tell you nothing's how it seems I've seen the world
with the clearest of eyes
A world of fear it's loud and clear and no surprise
They watch us from above
Can you feel the chaos overtaking us like a never ending plague, they watch us from
above, crying tears of blood for the souls of the world
They watch us from above
Now I hear the voices of an ancient race
Peering through the veil of time and space
Emerging from the void I am reborn I see the world for what it really is
Distorted visions of heaven
I have discovered there's hope in my heart
For I am One I am One
I am Love
I am Bliss I am Everything
I am Everything you fear
Everything you've ever known
But don't be scared for I am here You think you see the world I'll tell you nothing's
how it seems
All your dreams
Nothings How it seems
All your dreams
