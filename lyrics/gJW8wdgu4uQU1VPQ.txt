I've been gone for so long and how I've missed you
My heart was aching for home
and then one night as i lay down, somewhere far from you
I dreamt that i heard you call my name, but my mind was playing games.
I knew right then that i'd returned, to where i was before
and I was so tired of being away that i just couldnt stay anymore.
What did i ever come here for
What did i ever come here for

I thought if i showed up in the night, in my best disguise
There is a doorway and your porchlight, that you would look into my eyes
and you would realize who i am, put your arms around me
you're going to love me so much more, than you ever did before
What did i ever come here for
What did i ever come here for

It wasn't too long before i showed up at your door
i'd been gone a thousand miles
I didn't know how much more i could stand, if i could stand at all
you said i looked like i'd been through world war two
and my soul was worn right through
I thought you would read my mind, i thought you'd ask me to stay
you'd never turned me away like before
but you closed the door anyway
What did i ever come here for
What did i ever come here for
What did i ever come here for
What did i ever come here for
