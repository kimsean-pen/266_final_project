If you're feeling low
And lost today
You're probably doing
Too much again
You spend all your hours
Just rushing around
Do you have a little time
Do you have a little time for me?

Slow down, my love
You're confusing me
If you're feeling stressed
Just try calling
You spend your time waiting
For anyone to see
Do you have a little time
Do you have a little time for me?

If you should stop for a while
You will find me standing by
Over here at the side of your life
I'd like to hold you still
Remind you of all you've missed
If you have a little time
If you have a little time that is

Why do you still run
When you could walk with me
Life will pass you by
When you move this quickly
What can you see
When you're spinning around
Do you have a little time
Do you have a little time for me

If you should stop for a while
You will find me standing by
Over here at the side of your life
I like to hold you still
Remind you of all you've missed
If you have a little time
If you have a little time that is

If you let me listen
I'll make you feel clear
You spend your time waiting
For anyone to see

If you should stop for a while
You will find me standing by
Over here at the side of your life
I'd like to hold you still
Remind you of all you've missed
If you have a little time
If you have a little time that is

If you should stop for a while
You will find me standing by
Over here at the side of your life
I'd like to hold you still
Remind you of all you've missed
If you have a little time
If you have a little time that is
