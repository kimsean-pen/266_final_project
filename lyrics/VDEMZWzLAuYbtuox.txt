Born with the moon in cancer
choose her a name she will answer to
call her green and the winters cannot fade her
call her green for the children who've made her
little green, be a gypsy dancer
He went to california
hearing that everything's warmer there
so you write him a letter and say, "her eyes are blue."
he sends you a poem and she's lost to you
little green, he's a non-conformer

Just a little green
like the color when the spring is born
there'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
just a little green
like the nights when the northern lights perform
there'll be icicles and birthday clothes
and sometimes there'll be sorrow
Child with a child pretending
weary of lies you are sending home
so you sign all the papers in the family name
you're sad and you're sorry, but you're not ashamed
little green, have a happy ending

Just a little green
like the color when the spring is born
there'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
just a little green
like the nights when the northern lights perform
there'll be icicles and birthday clothes
and sometimes there'll be sorrow
