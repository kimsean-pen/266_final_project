Oh there is a murderess amongst us
Her love is a violent spiral
Hurling in upon us, conjured up
At the birth of the world

Durga is a dancer
Mindless questions find no answers
Slicing through the ether
Yeah she's gleaming like mother of pearl

Dirty little whirlwind
Commander, controller I found you
Dirty little whirlwind
I am pinned by the heat of your swirl

Dirty little whirlwind
Defender, destroyer I found you
Dirty little whirlwind
Tangled up in the flesh of a girl

Oh, you could curl me beside you
The spark in your eyes belies the Apocalypse inside you
Twisting the pits from the particle
Skull can't save face

So shake the shame from it
Burn me up inside you
Let me churn in your furnace of whirl

Dirty little whirlwind
Commander, controller I found you
Dirty little whirlwind
I am pinned by the heat of your swirl

Dirty little whirlwind
Defender, destroyer I found you
Dirty little whirlwind
All caught up in the flesh of a girl

All that I ever wanted to be was destroyed at sea
Hurricane rescued me salvaged calamity
All that I ever wanted to be was destroyed at sea
Hurricane rescued me salvaged calamity

Do not delay
We stood in place for it
Turn me up inside you
Up and into the heart of your world
