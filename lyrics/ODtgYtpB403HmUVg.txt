I'm in a car crash, curled
There's a fire in my precious soul
No single tear
Beyond control

As the night so long
Got no guru that would take me home
My lonely heart
From end to start

Horses
Flames catch on fire
Horses
Riders of the night
And faced
Look in the dark
Look in the dark
Look in the dark

In the void I go
Nothing here...
Here comes the night
My midnight ride

Horses
Flames catch on fire
Horses
Riders of the night
And faces
Look in the dark
Look in the dark
Look in the dark
Horses
Flames catch on fire
Horses
Riders of the night
And faces
Look in the dark
Look in the dark
Look in the dark
