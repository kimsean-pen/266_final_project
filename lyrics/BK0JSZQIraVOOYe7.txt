Ask the girl of the hour by the water tower's watch
If your friends took a fall, are your obligated to follow
Time after time after time

When the bull's on his hooves, when you gather friends by the tower
If you try to refuse, will they judge your worth by the hour
Time after time after time, time after time after time

If you're tired and you've tried you can find me in my room
You can stay if you want but the third time you can't lose
Time after time after time, time after time after time

Ask the girl of the hour by the water tower's watch
We can fight if you want but who will turn out the lights
Time after time after time, time after time after time
Time after time after time, time after time after time
