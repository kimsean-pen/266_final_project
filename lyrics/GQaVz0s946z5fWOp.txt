I used to never wear a seatbelt
I said I didn't care
What happened
I didn't see the point
Trying to save myself
From an accident
Somebody's gonna help me
What's this fabric gonna help
When I'm pitched through the windshield
I hope the last thing that I felt before the pavement
Was my body float
I hope my soul goes too

I shouldn't have let you leave
I should've called you twice
But I didn't
It's always something else
And I know it's a bad time
But there's no one left for me to call
And I was wondering if you would be my ride
And damn it, we are gonna figure something out
If it takes me all night to make it hurt less

Leave the car running
I'm not ready to go
It doesn't matter where
I just don't want to be alone
As long as you're not tired yet
Of talking, it helps to make it hurt less

Oh, leave the car running
I'm not ready to go
It doesn't matter where
I just don't want to be alone
And as long as you're not tired yet
Of talking, it helps to make it hurt less

This year, I've started wearing safety belts
When I'm driving
Because when I'm with you
I don't have to think about myself
And it hurts less
