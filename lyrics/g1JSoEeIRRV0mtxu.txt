Look at this face
I know, the years are showin'
Look at this life
I still don't know, where it's goin'

I don't know much
But I know, I Love You
And that, may be
All, I need to know

Look at these eyes
They've never seen, what mattered
Look at these dreams
So, beat & so battered

I don't know much
But I know, I Love You
That, may be
All, I need to know

So, many questions
Still left unanswered
So, much
I've never broken through

And when, I feel you near me
Sometimes, I see so clearly
The only truth
I've ever known
Is me & you...

Look at this man
So, blessed with inspiration
Look at this soul
Still searching for salvation

I don't know much
But I know, I Love You
And that, may be
All, I need to know

(...)

I don't know much
But I know, I Love You
That, may be
All, I need to know...

I don't know much
But I know, I Love You
That, may be
All, there is
...To know
