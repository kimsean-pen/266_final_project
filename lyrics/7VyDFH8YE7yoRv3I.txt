I can't feel this way much longer
Expecting to survive
With all these hidden innuendos
Just waiting to arrive
It's such a wavy midnight
And you slip into insane
Electric angel rock and roller
I hear what you're playin'

It's an orangy sky
Always it's some other guy
It's just a broken lullaby
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love

Substitution, mass confusion
Clouds inside your head
Were fogging all my energies
Until you visited
With your eyes of porcelain and of blue
Could shock me into sense
You think you're so illustrious
You call yourself intense

It's an orangy sky
Always it's some other guy
It's just a broken lullaby
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Yeah bye bye love
Bye bye love-ov-ov-ove

Substitution, mass confusion
Clouds inside your head
Were fogging all my energies
Until you visited
With your eyes of porcelain and of blue
Could shock me into sense
You think you're so illustrious
You call yourself intense

It's an orangy sky
Always it's some other guy
It's just a broken lullaby
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
