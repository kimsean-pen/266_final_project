We 'bout to make a movie
A-1, this the new me
I done popped two tabs,
and they all up in my system know the boy feeling groovy
As a man I keep it moving
Taking risks, getting to it
Being broke don't amuse me
The fuck you niggas doing?
And I ain't even tripping, I'm chilling
Sitting here looking at the ceiling
Thinking how the sky be the limit
BIG told me sky was the limit, yeah
And I ain't never had this feeling
Fuck up money that's just how I'm feeling, yeah
Fuck you and all of your feelings
My black skin done made me a villain, I'm killing

All of these tracks
All of these Backwoods
And all of these racks
We got money now
This shit ain't funny now
Tell shorty right there

To bring that ass back

All of these tracks
All of these Backwoods
And all of these racks
We got money now
This shit ain't funny now

Tell shorty right there
To bring that ass back
