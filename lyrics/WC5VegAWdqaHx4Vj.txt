Have you noticed I've never been impressed
By your friends from New York and London
I'll level accusations like the press
Until you realise that you've dressed yourself in tatters
Because the man's needs

Man's needs
Are full of greed
Are full of greed
A man's needs
Man's needs
Are lost on me
A man's needs

Man's needs
Are full of greed
Are full of greed
A man's needs

I'm not bothered
What you say or how you dress
I'm a mess so you've always seemed inviting
But really
This all seems quite meaningless and I remember
That you never seem to see
The fact that man's needs

Man's needs
Are full of greed
Are full of greed
A man's needs

Man's needs
Are lost on me
A girl's needs
Girl's needs
Just don't agree
Just don't agree
With a man's needs
Have you noticed i've never been
impressed by your friends from New York and London?

But really this all seems quite meaningless and I remember
That you never seem to see
The excuse that man's needs
Man's needs
Are full of greed
Are full of greed
A man's needs
Man's needs
Are lost on me
You say your man's needs
Man's needs
Have apply to me
I don't agree
A man's needs
Oh oh oh oh
