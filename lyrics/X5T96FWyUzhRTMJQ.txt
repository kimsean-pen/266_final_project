Let them be shot by gravity
Thin the crowd
Let them be shot by gravity
Thin the crowd
Fate rushing upwards
Make their heads go pop
Greedy bastards, rank amateur professionals
Emotional cripples, religious fascists
Alt-weekly types, human diopran
Envious cowards, envious associates
Internet risottos, smug urban settlers
Anvil pathtub, crucible sublime
Old foreign skulls, neon fans on laptops
Recent memories, underwear ferries
Rich crusts, adults dressed as children
Do-nothing know-it-alls
What democracy looks like
Upper-class smugglers
Texas in miniature, shot counters
Credit-card-users, angry cat eaters
Most bands ever
Savvy bartenders
Throw them, throw them off
