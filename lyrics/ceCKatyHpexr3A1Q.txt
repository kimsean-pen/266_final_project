Baby, I'm back
And right away I have come to you
To see if the love that we knew before
Has past the test of time, ooh
Time could change almost everything
Sometimes it seems the better side are the
Feelings we once shared
So baby

Let's go round again
Maybe we'll turn back the hands of time
Let's go round again
One more time
Let's go round again
Maybe we'll turn back the hands of time
Let's go round again
One more time, one more time, one more time
One more time

Now baby, I know that you think I will be different now
Inside of me nothing has changed
So I'm asking you again, ooh
Please no one else could have brought me back
No one could ever change, the memory I kept within my heart

Let's go round again
Maybe we'll turn back the hands of time
Let's go round again
One more time
Let's go round again
Maybe we'll turn back the hands of time
Let's go round again
One more time, one more time, one more time
One more time
Let's go round again
Maybe we'll turn back the hands of time
Let's go round again
One more time, one more time, one more time
Let's go round again, one more time
