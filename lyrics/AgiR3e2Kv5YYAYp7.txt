Awake to find the water rushing in through cracks in the ceiling.
Grab your oxygen supply and leave everything behind.
Dive in.
Avoiding all debris, swim to the bottom of the sea.
Find some shelter try and breathe, we could be here for a while.
This house was shifting in our sleep from right under our feet, down to the ocean floor.
Stay strong, we are with you all along, spotting you for sharks in the shadows of the rocks.
