I used to go out to parties, and stand around
'Cause I was too nervous, to really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor, somebody could choose me

No more standin' there beside the walls
Finally got myself together, baby, and I'm havin' a ball
Long as you're groovin', there's always a chance
Somebody watchin' might wanna make romance

Move your body, ooh baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel alright
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me, spread out and let me in
Baby, just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone

Move it up, turn it 'round
Ooo, shake it down
Oww, you can love me when you want to, babe
This is such a groovy party, baby
We're here face to face, everybody's swingin'

This is such a groovy place
All the young ladies are so fine
You're movin' your body easy with no doubts
I know what you thinkin', baby, you want to turn me out
I think I'm gonna let you do it, babe

Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up

Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up

Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up

Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up

Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up...
