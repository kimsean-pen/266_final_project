Let 'em work
'Cause if they want a fantasy, they can work for ya
Somebody better show what they're worth for ya
We'll keep 'em waiting if you know they're keen
Teach 'em patience if you know they're keen
Let 'em work
'Cause if they want a fantasy, they can work for ya
Somebody better show what they're worth for ya
We'll keep 'em waiting if you know they're keen
Teach 'em patience if you know they're keen

What you thinking?
Are you in it?
'Cause they've been watching us, all over, all night
Wait a minute, take a second
'Cause we ain't nobodies for nothing tonight
Let 'em work
And though you may be sugar sweet in that suit and tie, oh
If you're quick to deceive,
best believe that we know your kind, and oh, oh

Let 'em work
'Cause if they want a fantasy, they can work for ya
Somebody better show what they're worth for ya
We'll keep 'em waiting if you know they're keen
Teach 'em patience if you know they're keen
Let 'em work
'Cause if they want a fantasy, they can work for ya
Somebody better show what they're worth for ya
We'll keep 'em waiting if you know they're keen
Teach 'em patience if you know they're keen
Let 'em work

We're on a mission
Do you get it?
I hope you ain't afraid to watch us take flight
Take a picture
Did you see it?
Confidence is on 100 tonight

You wanna be in between me, myself and I, oh
Let's see what you feel, if it's real
When I take my time

Let 'em work
'Cause if they want a fantasy, they can work for ya
Somebody better show what they're worth for ya
We'll keep 'em waiting if you know they're keen
Teach 'em patience if you know they're keen
Let 'em work
'Cause if they want a fantasy, they can work for ya
Somebody better show what they're worth for ya
We'll keep 'em waiting if you know they're keen
Teach 'em patience if you know they're keen
Let 'em work

Let 'em work

Let 'em work
'Cause if they want a fantasy, they can work for ya
Somebody better show what they're worth for ya
We'll keep 'em waiting if you know they're keen
Teach 'em patience if you know they're keen
Let 'em work
'Cause if they want a fantasy, they can work for ya
Somebody better show what they're worth for ya
We'll keep 'em waiting if you know they're keen
Teach 'em patience if you know they're keen
Let 'em work

Let 'em work
I could be everything you wanted and I'm right here, right here
But you ain't everything I needed though you're right here, right here
Let 'em work
Let 'em work
