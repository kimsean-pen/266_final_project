If you pass away,
in the wing fortress there's a time divider
And a technical team will be at your services
for what that matters.
When the mirror shatters it's harder for me to see

If there are any answers here we haven't searched for,
Just type in your code and say a prayer
How could it be, we were so secure?
'cause nothing you've ever planned on
ever turned out the way you planned

I tried to say
This couldn't feel more wrong
I can't believe its happening
or lasting this long
If we know each other
then why should it be so hard to make it stop?

If there are any answers here we haven't searched for,
Just type in your code and say a prayer
How could it be, we were so secure?
'cause nothing you've ever planned on
ever turned out the way you planned

What I tried to say
This isn't real, and I feel ashamed that I don't think that I can heal
It's a shame that I would pretend before making amends
It's a shame that I can't
But nothing you've ever planned on ever turns out
But nothing you've ever planned on ever turned out the way you planned
You're still disappointing them
You're still disappointing
You're still disappointing them

If there are any answers here we haven't searched for,
Just type in your code and say a prayer
How could it be, we were so secure?
Nothing you've ever planned on ever turned out the way you planned
