Out of breath and out of cash
Find yourself watching M.A.S.H.
Every night on the couch
Woman says let's take a drive on south

Roll down the windows and open our mouths
Taste where we are and play the music loud
Stop the car, lay on the grass
The planets spin and we watch space pass

Walk a direction, see where we get
I never knew nothing so there's nothing to forget
Get real drunk and ride our bikes
There's so much beauty it could make you cry

There's so much beauty it could make you cry
There's so much beauty it could make you cry

The rich get money but never what they want
Find ourselves a new place to haunt
Climb up the fire escape
Do it 'till the ground looks far away

Go night swimming, leave our clothes on the ground
when we get busted we just stand there proud
It's the truth we all been wrong
Make it up and then let's move on

Playing cards, we all get to act sly
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
