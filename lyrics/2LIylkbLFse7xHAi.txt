I was made back in the 70's
But wasn't born till '89
I crossed the galaxy to be with you tonight
'Cause I feel like I'm changing all the time

Less is more, less is more
Less is more, less is more
Less is more and that's for sure

I cut my teeth on you, I bought a cell
I learn to die on first divide
I crossed a galaxy to be a part of stage
No matter when, no matter where, I follow the rage

Less is more, less is more
Less is more, less is more
Less is more and that's for sure

Yeah, one thing that I know for sure
Less is more

Less is more, less is more
Less is more, less is more
Less is more and that's for sure
One thing that I know for sure
One thing that I know for sure
Less is more
