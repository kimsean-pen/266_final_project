I promise, baby, I'ma come around soon
My love's not far away, so keep falling
Meet at the bottom, I'll be waiting on you
That's all I really want, yeah
All I really want, yeah
So if you're really the one, yeah
Then you'll reach no matter what, yeah

No matter how far it seems I've gone
Reach for me, baby, baby, baby
And if you want me, let me see them open arms
Reach for me, baby, baby
(I'm not far away)
And if you think I cannot see your vision
Of giving you my heart and run away with you
Ooh, I promise I'm not ignoring, I'm listening
