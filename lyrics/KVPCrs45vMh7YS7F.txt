Call it the new stage
Throw out the order away
Who can decide then...
A direction?

Her eyes, in her eyes
Her eyes, in her eyes

Her eyes, they feed us
Forever orange days
Her eyes, they feed us
Forever orange days
Her eyes feed us
Forever orange days
Her eyes, they feed us
Forever orange days

And with the coming sun
This darkness had to leave...
Where could it go then?
A new dimension?

Her eyes, in her eyes
Her eyes, in her eyes

Her eyes, they feed us
Forever orange days
Her eyes, they feed us
Forever orange days
Her eyes feed us
Forever orange days
Her eyes, they feed us
Forever orange days
Her eyes, feed us
Forever orange days
Her eyes, they feed us
Forever orange days
