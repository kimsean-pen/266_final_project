It's been a very very long time
I'm afraid
You and I should maybe let it go
And hide away
It's been a very very long time
Well I'm sorry
But you never really let me grow up baby
Oh it's a long long time (very long time)
That you and I let it go
And it's drivin' you insane (drivin' you insane)
And it's givin' me vertigo
We had a very happy good time (happy good time)
For real
And i never ever really come for a change
But it's a long long time (very long time)
That you and I let it go
And it's drivin' you insane (drivin' you insane)
And it's givin' me vertigo
It's givin' me vertigo
It's givin' me vertigo
It's givin' me vertigo
It's givin' me vertigo
It's givin' me vertigo
It's givin' me vertigo
It's givin' me vertigo
It's givin' me vertigo
