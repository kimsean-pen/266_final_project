I've tried
To hide a certain side of me
Closed eyes
I'm tired of this reality

I just wanna feel alive
I'm drifting in space
But when I'm falling back to Earth
I'll find out if it hurts

Too many thoughts inside my head
I guess I'm going crazy instead
I meant all of the things I said
I hope one day you will understand

I feel
I can't just let it go again
And still
Time flies and then it slows again

Can you guess what I'm thinking 'bout?
Oh I know, she knows
'Cause I'm just trying to figure out
If I'm meant to let go

I don't wanna know
If I'm losing control
I need to know
How to find my soul
I don't wanna know
If I'm losing control
I need to know
How to find my soul

Too many thoughts inside my head
I guess I'm going crazy instead
I meant all of the things I said
I hope one day you will understand
