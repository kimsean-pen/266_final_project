Oh, baby
Oh, baby (Keep on)
My baby (Keep on doin' it, right on)
Right on doin' it
You got it together (Baby, keep on)
Oh, you got it together, baby (Right on, keep on doin' it)
Gotta get it baby, oh gotta get it
My, my baby, keep on
I swear you got it together, baby (Keep on, keep on)

Whatever, whatever
Girl, I'll do
Forever and ever, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll see you through

I've got to keep you pleased in every way I can
Gonna give you all of me as much as you can stand
Make love to you right now, that's all I want to do
I know you need it, girl, and you know I need it, too

'Cause I found what the world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more
And, oh, my babe
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do

Never, never gonna give you up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Not the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you
I'm never, ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my stick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
And do all the things you want me to

Whatever you want
Girl, you got it
And whatever you need
I don't want to see you without it

You've given me much more than words could ever say
And oh, my dear, I'll be right here until my dyin' day
I don't know just how to say all the things I feel
I just know that I love you so and it gives me such a thrill

'Cause I found what this world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more
And all of my days
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do

I'm never, never gonna give you up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Stop the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you
I'm never, ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my stick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to

Oh, I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
All the things I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you

I'm never, ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my stick...
