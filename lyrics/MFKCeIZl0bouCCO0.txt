People say it's not cool
To be sweet like you
They wanna wrecking in a moment
Keep you cynical

Well that's not me, sister
It's not much [?]
We do our walking to the water
And I take you down

And I'm harder walking with you
Can't tell me how it wasn't at beginning of our land?
Well, like a dream time
Sharing our skin again

I open up my eyes under water
I used to open up my eyes under water
I open up my eyes under water
I just don't open up my eyes under water

And I'm looking at you!
You just think too much
You gonna get out of your hair
Baby, get back in touch

Well, there is a secret in the river
And the river is deep
If we drink back in it

And I'm harder walking with you again
Tell me how it wasn't at beginning of our land
Well, like a dream time
Sharing our skin again

I open up my eyes under water
I used to open up my eyes under water
I open up my eyes under water
I just don't open up my eyes under, under the water

And you got the proof
Standing up on your feet
Even tho people like to see you leaving that on the peace
What did [?]
Take me into your arms!

Well, there is a secret in the river
And the river is deep
You don't need to feel the future
If you see what I see

And I'm harder walking with you again
Tell me how it wasn't at beginning of our land
Well, like a dream time
Sharing our skin again

I open up my eyes under water
I used to open up my eyes under the water
I open up my eyes under water
I just don't open up my eyes under, under the water
