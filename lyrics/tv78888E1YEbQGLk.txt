All my people in the crowd
Grab a partner take it down

It's me against the music
It's just me
Yeah
Oh
Are you ready? (Uh huh, are you?)
Oooh...

It's whippin' my hair, it's pullin' my waist
The sweat is drippin' all over my face
I'm the only one dancin' up in this place (it's just me)
Feel the beat of the drum, gotta get with that bass (uh)

I'm up against the speaker, tryin' to take on the music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in a zone (get in the zone)
I wanna get in a zone (I wanna get in the zone)
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
Tryin' to hit it, chic-a-ta
In a minute I'ma take-a you on (I'ma take-a you on)
I'ma take-a you on (I'ma take-a you on)

All my people on the floor, let me see you dance
All my people wantin' more, let me see you dance
All my people round and round, let me see you dance
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance

Let's take on the song
Let's take on the song

All night long
Oh, yeah, let's go

I'm feelin' it bad and I can't explain
My hips are movin' at a rapid pace
From the tip of my toes, runnin' through my veins (oooh)
Let me see what you got, don't hesitate

I'm up against the speaker, tryin' to take on the music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in a zone (I wanna get in the zone)
I wanna get in a zone (I wanna get in the zone)
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
Tryin' to hit it, chic-a-ta
In a minute I'ma take-a you on (I'ma take-a you on)
I'ma take-a you on (I'ma take-a you on)

All my people on the floor, let me see you dance
All my people wantin' more, let me see you dance
All my people round and round, let me see you dance
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance

If you wanna party
