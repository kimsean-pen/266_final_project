I can feel it aching within every bone inside me
I can feel it breaking out, retaliation, released
I need to cause the evil-doers' suffering
Can't wait to choke the life out from your baneful bodies

If only I could afflict you
Hurt you in the same way that you hurt
I just want to exact reprisal, retribution calls
The only way I depict you
Is that your redemption's undeserved
Meet the vessel of your reprisal, retribution calls

It's not that I take life for granted
It's only that the good won't make it
Innocence dies while villainy thrives

How can you harm a living thing, thinking that it's your right?
How can you defile a life, deprive it of innocence?
For too long you have gotten away with murder
A fitting justice would be your painful execution

If only I could afflict you
Hurt you in the same way that you hurt
I just want to exact reprisal, retribution calls
The only way I depict you
Is that your redemption's undeserved
Meet the vessel of your reprisal, retribution calls

It's not that I take life for granted
It's only that the good won't make it
Innocence dies while villainy thrives
It's not that I take life for granted
It's only that the good won't make it
Innocence dies while villainy thrives

I want to ruin the rapist
Punish the criminal
Violate the abuser
End the murderer
I want to ruin the rapist
Punish the criminal
Violate the abuser
End the murderer

It's not that I take life for granted
It's only that the good won't make it
Innocence dies while villainy thrives (villainy thrives)
It's not that I take life for granted
It's only that the good won't make it
Innocence dies while villainy thrives (villainy thrives)
