It started as a whisper.
Now try to dodge this roar.
Unified is the most forceful way to go.
Waste this one?
It's up to you!
We need this revolution.

Destroy the pattern, anything that separates
Across the times, who dares to follow?

For years we wandered these circles
Hold on to whatever lie gets us through

Design new latitudes
Find ways to channel bliss.
Us defined is too fragile to neglect.
Reroute to remain.
Reroute to remain!

Never want to look back in greed
Can I please have your attention?

There are mountains to cross
For all that are willing
There are never ending treasures that await you.

For years we wandered these circles
Hold on to whatever lie gets us through

Design new latitudes
Find ways to channel bliss.
Us defined is too fragile to neglect.
Reroute to remain.
Reroute to remain!
