I'm too light and you're too soon
I'm too light and you're too soon
let me in the other room
I'm too light and you're too soon

Never trust the palest girl
(all the houses are taken)
Palest girls, with palest hearts
(all apartments not for sale)
Nothing in return
(all the heads are rented out)
(please rent me out of being hopeless)
They will bake them all for you
(city has not been kind to me)
They will bake their palest hearts
(I've only been working)
Just to watch them burn
(prices rise when sun rises)
(and sun rises when I'm not looking)

So grow up now
(my heart just grow up now)
Oh! Just grow up now!
(all this time, oh!)

I'm too light and you're too soon
I'm too light and you're too soon
let me in the other room
I'm too light and you're too soon

This could take away the pain
(all the houses are taken)
Twenty spoons to fall asleep
(all apartments not for sale)
We will be brand new
(all the heads are rented out/)
(please rent me out of being hopeless)
And it could take us 20 years
(city has not been kind to me)
But if we only fall asleep
(I've only been working)
All our dreams come true
(prices rise when sun rises)
(and sun rises when I'm not looking)

So hold me down!
(hold me down)
Oh! Just down down down!
(just down down down)
(for it's too late)

I'm too light and you're too soon
I'm too light and you're too soon
let me in the other room
I'm too light and you're too soon

(You know I would rather...)
