I see lovers in the
Streets walking
Without a care.
They're wearing out loud

Like there's something in the air
Oooooh, and I don't care
They're treading lightly
No they, don't sink in
There's no tracks to follow

They don't care where they going, Hmm
And if they're lucky and they'll
They'll get to see and if they're
Really, really lucky they'll
Get to feel

And it kicks so hard
Breaks your bones.
Cuts so deep
It hits your soul
Tears your skin and
Makes your blood flow
It's better that you know
That love is hard

Love takes hostages
Gives them pain
Gives someone the power to
Hurt you again and again

Oooh, but they don't care
Oh and if they're lucky and they'll
They'll get to see and if they're
Really, really lucky they'll

They'll get to feel
And if they're
They're truely blessed
And they're get to believe

And if you're
Dammed, you'll never
Let youreself be deceived

And it kicks so hard
It breaks your bones
Cuts so deep
It hits your soul
Tears your skin and
Makes your blood flow
It's better that we know
That love is hard
Hmmmmmmm

Kicks so hard
It breaks your bones
Cuts so deep
It hits your soul

Tears your skin and
Makes your blood flow
It's beter that we know

It kicks so hard
It breaks your bones
Cuts so deep
It hits your soul

Tears your skin and
And makes your blood flow
It's better that you know
That love is hard

Love is hard, love is hard
If it was easy
It wouldn't mean nothing, no
