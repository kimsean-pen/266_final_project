The streets alive with people
The people who want to move, move, move
How could all these people have so much to prove, prove, prove
Oh I can only ask myself
Oh where are you all going
And won't you take me with you to
Where all the sirens are blaring

Uptight downtown
I'll prove that's how you make the ground
And now I know the temperature is rising, is rising

Uptight downtown
I'll prove that's how the make the ground
And now I know the temperature is rising, is rising

The streets alive with people
With nothing else to lose, lose, lose
When did all these people decide to change their shoes, shoes, shoes
Oh I can only ask myself
Oh where are you all going
And won't you take me with you to
Where all the sirens are blaring

Uptight downtown
I'll prove that's how you make the ground
And now I know the temperature is rising, is rising

Uptight downtown
I'll prove that's how you make the ground
And now I know the temperature is rising, is rising

Uptight downtown
Uptight downtown
Uptight downtown
Uptight downtown

Why are we fighting
I don't understand
Oh the temperature is rising tonight
