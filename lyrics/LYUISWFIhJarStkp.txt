Winter lips
A winters kiss with you
Winter bliss
Winter missed with you
It's following you
Everywhere you go
It's swallowing you
Nothing left to hold
You wallow in youth
Winter blowing colder than lost you
Morning waves
Morning breaks with you
Morning pain
Morning strain with you
It's following you
Everywhere you go
It's swallowing you
Nothing left to hold
You wallow in youth
Winter blowing colder than lost you
I'll make the spring alright
I'll make the spring alright
I'll make the spring alright
I'll make the spring alright
