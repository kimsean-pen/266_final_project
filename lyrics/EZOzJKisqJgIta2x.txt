Never found Jesus, you got me believin'
Overdose on your wet skin, it's better than textin', oh
I'm still fiendin', after so many seasons
Still bettin' five hundred, without cheatin'

Ringin' in my ears, it's you
Got me goin' crazy, walkin' on a tightrope
Now I'm doin' things I won't do
This is what you made me, baby I'm a psycho
But we do it better than anybody do
I'ma Cinderella, and you ain't gotta shoe
Tell me I'm your best song, singing out of tune

When we lie together, it's the truth
When we lie together, it's the truth
When we lie together, it's the truth
When we lie together...

Always been realer, that's so familiar
We're so peculiar, we like dopin' with the dealer
It's no ugly, you make the pain feel lovely
You're my pillow in a hot night
My cigarillo in a hot life

Ringin' in my ears, it's you
Got me goin' crazy, walkin' on a tightrope
Now I'm doin' things I won't do
This is what you made me, baby I'm a psycho
Maybe I'm a psycho, baby I'm a psycho
Maybe I'm a psycho...
But we do it better than anybody do
I'ma Cinderella, and you ain't gotta shoe
Tell me I'm your best song, singing out of tune

When we lie together, it's the truth
When we lie together, it's the truth
Oh, when we lie together, it's the truth
When we lie together... together...
(It's the truth)
