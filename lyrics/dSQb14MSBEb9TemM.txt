I can't help myself
I keep ending up in Memorial Park
Breaking fingernails
While I claw at the frozen ground
'Cause as long as I'm home
I can dig up these bones
There's no point to just letting go
& as long as you've known me

I've been backing out slowly
I won't end up underneath the snow
This is where it's been
The manger scene every Christmas
Next to the cannon
Every year someone steals baby Jesus

Nobody stops them
It's a nice tradition
I'll put my life back together in silence while
Writing songs on Molly's guitar

& suburbia, stop pushing
I know what I'm doing
So I moved myself
& two boxes of things
To the basement room at Richie's house
& I'm happy here for now
Because I've been in search of some steadier footing or
Just a place to call home

I know that I'm introspective when broken but
I've been spending most of my nights here alone
& that doesn't scare me like it did a year ago
I'll put my life back together in silence while
Writing songs on Molly's guitar
& suburbia, stop pushing
I know what I'm doing
Suburbia, stop pushing

I know what I'm doing
Suburbia, stop pushing
I know what I'm doing
I had dreams of myself
As the Allen Ginsberg of this generation
But without the talent
Madness, or vision
I guess it's looking hopeless
We're a city left digging out cars in unison
& humming like we've healed
I know we've got miles to go
But I'm putting my shoulder to the wheel
