I've seen the only living traces filter in the sulphur
The ones who do believe me place your favour
Before you lay your question down there's a matter of the payment
To you I slipped on crooked sores in conclaves that you bothered

Let me be your Tourniquet Man
Let me keep you as a favour
Let me be your Tourniquet Man
Let me keep you as a favour
When I hear your fingers they will spell my name
As I trade the faces of the holders

Let me be your Tourniquet Man
Let me keep you as a favour
Let me be your Tourniquet Man
Let me keep you as a favour

I can't diminish anymore if I chose to dissolve in you
There's so much we can lose
I can't diminish anymore if I chose to dissolve in you
There's so much we can lose
