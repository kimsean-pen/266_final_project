I wanna feel hope when I die
So I know what I left behind
I wanna feel peace when I rest
So I know that I passed loves test
Oh, so I know that I passed loves test

And I always want more
But with you I never get bored
So wake me up in five
I'll walk the dog you stay inside

I don't wanna feel alone when I sleep
Heavy chest I'm tryin' to breathe
Don't rob me from what I might need
Joyful mind in the breeze

And I will drive the whole way back
You can rest assured that
Tear apart the divide
Strawberry fields in my mind

I wanna feel hope when I die
So I know what I left behind
I wanna feel peace when I rest
So I know that I passed loves test
Oh, so I know that I passed loves test
