I'll see you when the wrath comes
Knocking on your bedroom door with money
Building you a kingdom
Dripping from the open mouth, I'll show you
What you look like, from the inside
And I'll see you when the wrath comes
Around

Tonight, you have the answer
Tonight, you have the answer

Let's load the gun
Make her eat the tape in the bathroom mirror
See if she can guess what
A hollow point does to a naked body
Let's fuck her up
Manifest pain at the core of pleasure
I'll see you when the wrath comes
Around

Tonight, you have the answer
Tonight, you have the answer

I'll see you when the wrath comes
