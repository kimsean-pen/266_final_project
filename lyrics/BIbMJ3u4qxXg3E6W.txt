Here stays enthroned the one that breathes the night
The blood ruler of great fights
Here stays enthroned the virgin of ten thousand sins
The virgin whose beauty dreams all light
She is the one that her love is lethal sweet
She is the one that owns the fate of clever fools
She is the one whose smile: means your defeat

Behold her name the threefold breath
The veil under her eyes portends only death
Her breast is venomous, her kiss rebirths
Go further and further close to the death

Be wise to time, be strong to hold
Her pleasure for the gods, orison for the souls
Her joy is earth, the color of gold
Her absence is named cold

The lady from the end of all life
Her power is the world, her fear is the life
Behold thyself do not make her your wife
Your soul belongs to her, to her knife

Fear not her lethal eternal grip
Her loss does not make you weak, keeps you strict
A demon is for you, for you to keep
Her ecstasy on your feet

(CHORUS)
The one that breathes the night
Blood ruler of great fights
Virgin of thousand sins
Her beauty dims all light
She walks on semi-dead souls
Her love is lethal sweet
She owns the fate of clever fools
Her smile, your defeat

Ice in her eyes-soil in her soul
Hard in her heart-harm in her arm
Death in her breath-pain in her name
She is inside-deep in your life
Miss you side-take my harm
Breathe my heart-in your side
We are in her-we must now hide
She is inside-deep in your life

Behold her name the threefold breath
The veil under her eyes portends only death
Her breast is venomous, her kiss rebirths
Go further and further close to the death

Be wise to time, be strong to hold
Her pleasure for the gods, orison for the souls
Her joy is earth, the color of gold
Her absence is named cold

(CHORUS)
