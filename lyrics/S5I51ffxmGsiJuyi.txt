Oh Anthonio
It's been nearly one year
Since our Rio
Nights of forever
Pictures of you and me
Dancing and memories

Through the masquerade
You led me by the hand
Whispered the words
"This is forever"
Said from the silver tongue
That's where it started from

Oh Anthonio
My Anthonio
Was I ever more than just a face in the crowd?
Did you even know my name?
Did you ever really care?

Oh Anthonio
My Anthonio
Do you ever wonder why or where I am now?
Do you ever feel ashamed?
Do you even feel a thing?

Oh

There I was under stars
Hearts made in the sand
Lying with the boy
From Ipanema
Tide comes rushing in
Time and time again
Now that summer has gone
Where did you run?
All my letters are returned to sender
For eternity
You're a part of me

Oh Anthonio
My Anthonio
Was I ever more than just a face in the crowd?
Did you even know my name?
Did you ever really care?

Oh Anthonio
My Anthonio
Do you ever wonder why or where I am now?
Do you ever feel ashamed?
Do you even feel a thing?

Oh

Oh Anthonio
My Anthonio
You got everything you ever wanted from me
I was just another girl
It was just another night
Oh Anthonio
My Anthonio
There is only one thing I've been trying to say
It may come as a surprise
My baby has your eyes
