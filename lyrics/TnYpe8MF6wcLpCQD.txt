I've been thinking too much
Too much to do to set my heart right
I've always heard that if you can do no good
At least do no harm

But it's not what I see
But it's not what I see

It's hard to feel this pain
Can't have it other way
Imagine how it goes

There's nothing left to say
Got nothing on my brain
I'm not the only one

Don't forget it, or you'll regret it
Inside...
Don't forget it, or you'll regret it
It takes darkness to see the light

Don't forget it, or you'll regret it
Inside...
Don't forget it, or you'll regret it

Do not disturb me, no...
Do not disturb me, no...

I've never believed in good and bad as only one
As soon as you're getting closer to the edge
You have to know where you belong

It's hard to feel this pain
Can't have it other way
Imagine how it goes

There's nothing left to say
Got nothing on my brain
I'm not the only one

Don't forget it, or you'll regret it
Inside...
Don't forget it, or you'll regret it
It takes darkness to see the light

Don't forget it, or you'll regret it
Inside...
Don't forget it, or you'll regret it
