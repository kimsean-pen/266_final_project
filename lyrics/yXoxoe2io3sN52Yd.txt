I'm gonna work my way
Out of this town.
I'm gonna be someone.
I know who I am.
But right now, now!
I don't think that I do.

We could leave this place
And fly far away.
Let's escape this town.
The streets and the cars and the crowds.
Then into the clouds.

Where nothing can stop us,
Nothing forever.
Where nothing can stop us,
If we stick together.

I might be dreaming but
I think I believe.
I might be seeing things
That aren't quite real.
But right now, now!
I don't care if I do.

I didn't mean those words
That I said back then.
I'm sorry!
I will never ever
Do that high again.
I promise that I won't.

Then nothing can stop us,
Nothing forever.
Nothing can stop us,
If we stick together.
Nothing can stop us,
Nothing forever.
Nothing can stop us,
If we stick together.

And now it's taking off.
The journey begins!
It's time to leave this place.
The streets and the cars and the crowds.
Then into the clouds.

(To some place) far away,
Forever ever.
Stay the same.
No never, never!
Into to the sky.
Then into the clouds.

It's far away,
Forever ever.
Stay the same.
No never, never!
Into to the sky,
Then into the clouds.

Then nothing can stop us,
Nothing forever.
Nothing can stop us,
If we stick together.
And nothing can stop us,
Nothing forever.
Nothing can stop us,
If we stick together.
