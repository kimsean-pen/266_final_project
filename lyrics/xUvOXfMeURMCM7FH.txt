Black, I only wear black
Spring in my step, knife in my back
It's just what I'm like, I keep it inside
Pills in my pocket, head in the sky
I only wear black

I moved to LA and it rained every single day
But I don't really care whether it's grey skies or blue
We camped at the beach, learned to surf and broke my knees
But I don't really care, they couldn't walk me back to you

Sometimes you win but generally, you lose

Black, I only wear black
Spring in my step, knife in my back
It's just what I'm like, I keep it inside
Pills in my pocket, head in the sky
I only wear black

Bought a brand new car and flattened a deer by Richmond Park
Suppose I'm not the only one who fails to see the light

Sometimes you laugh but usually, you cry

Black, I only wear black
Spring in my step, knife in my back
It's just what I'm like, I keep it inside
Pills in my pocket, head in the sky
I only wear black
I only wear black
I only wear black, oh
I only wear black, oh
I only wear black
