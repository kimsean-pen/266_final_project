Am I allowed to look at her like that?
Could it be wrong
When she's just so nice to look at?

And she smells like lemongrass and sleep
She tastes like apple juice and peach
Oh, you would find her in a Polaroid picture
And she...
Means everything to me

Oh, oh
I'd never tell
No, I'd never say a word
And oh, it aches
But it feels oddly good to hurt

And she smells like lemongrass and sleep
She tastes like apple juice and peach
Oh, you would find her in a Polaroid picture
And she...
Means everything to me

Oh-oh (ooh, ooh), ooh-oh
Oh-oh (ooh, ooh), ooh-oh

And I'll be okay
Admiring from afar
'Cause even when she's next to me
We could not be more far apart
And she tastes like birthday cake and story time and fall
But to her
I taste of nothing at all

And she smells like lemongrass and sleep
She tastes like apple juice and peach
Oh, you would find her in a Polaroid picture
And she...
Means everything to me
Yes, she means everything to me
She means everything to me
