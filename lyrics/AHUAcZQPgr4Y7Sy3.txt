Hiding in the morning light
You can come here any time
Right past their prying eye
You can come here anytime
In the light I'm falling
Held in the eye of night
Malice keeps calling,
Your palms keep on calming
You are carried
You are carried
It was in the morning light
Bruised skin on top of mine
Give me the creeps of painful like
I held you in my underwear
Give me the creeps of painful like
Someone might see, but I don't care
We don't have to marry

In this town we'll bury
All the minds that clench too tight
You are carried
You are carried
We don't have to marry
In the light you bet it all
In this town we'll bury
All the minds that clench too tight
You are carried
You are carried
You are carried
You are carried
You are carried
You are carried
You are carried
You are carried
