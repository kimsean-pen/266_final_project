Loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
Seems like we're meant to be

And I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're coming from
Well I don't care, as long as you love me
As long as you love me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
