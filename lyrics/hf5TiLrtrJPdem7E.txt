I go to sleep with my demons
Creep in my head every night
They come to shred all my dreams
And I bled on my bed
Why is this my life?
Why? Why?
(Something's wrong with me)
Something's wrong with me
(These chains around me)
Sinking
What you did to me
(I can't let go)
Bleeding
You tear me into a million cuts
I can't forget what you know you've done
I hope you're happy wherever you are
Cause you're the reason I'm afraid of the dark
I go to sleep with my demons
The past is always awake
They sink their claws digging deeper
They all come for feeding inside of me
Take my demons away
I go to sleep with my demons
Creep in my head every night
They come to shred all my dreams
And I bled on my bed why is this my life
Take my demons away
Why?
Something's wrong with me
I pray for you to suffer
You taught me to hate, I suffocate
Go under
Just once could I have a different life
Where I can sleep closing both my eyes
I hope you're happy wherever you are
Cause you're the reason I'm afraid of the dark
I go to sleep with my demons
The past is always awake
They sink their claws digging deeper
They all come for feeding inside of me
Take my demons away
I go to sleep with my demons
Creep in my head every night
They come to shred all my dreams
And I bled on my bed why is this my life
Take my demons away
Why, why, why is this my life?
I can't, I can't close my eyes
Why, why, why is this my life?
I can't, I can't close my eyes
Why, why, why is this my life?
I can't, I can't close my eyes
I hope you're happy wherever you are
Cause you're the reason I'm afraid of the dark
I go to sleep with my demons
I go to sleep with my demons
The past is always awake
They sink their claws digging deeper
They all come for feeding inside of me
Take my demons away
I go to sleep with my demons
Creep in my head every night
They come to shred all my dreams
And I bled on my bed why is this my life
Take my demons away
Why, why, why is this my life?
I can't, I can't close my eyes
Why, why, why is this my life?
I can't, I can't close my eyes
