I knew all along
That I was right at the start
Bout the seeds of the weeds
That grew in your heart

Self satisfaction for the factions
Who formed to tear us apart
Well I gave you the Midas touch
Oh you turned round and scratched out my heart

Oh what did you expect?
Oh tell me what did you expect?
To lay it on my head
So is it all upon my head?

Bang bang you're dead
Always so easily lead
Bang bang you're dead
Put all the rumours to bed
Bang bang you're dead

I knew all along
But I was loathe to believe
There was nothing but spite
Fury and lies

Of the words that you weave
An illusion to a conclusion
And oh it's oh so tawdry
When you put it to bed

Kick it in the head
Oh wont they just let it be
Bang bang you're dead
Always so easily lead
Bang bang you're dead

Put all the rumours to bed
Bang bang you're dead
Oh what did you expect?
Oh tell me what did you expect?
To lay it on my head
So is it all upon my head?
Bang bang you're dead
Always so easily lead
Bang bang you're dead
Put all the rumours to bed
Bang bang you're dead
Bang bang bang bang you're dead
