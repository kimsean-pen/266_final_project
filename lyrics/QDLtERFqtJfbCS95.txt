I am not a pattern to be followed
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow
I'm not a criminal, not a role model
Not a born leader I'm a tough act to follow
I am not the fortune and the fame
Nor the same person telling you to forfeit the game
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain
And I found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems

And it seems ugly, but it can get worse
'Cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
'Cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first

And I'm not a robot
I'm not a monkey
I will not dance even if the beat's funky
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk
Ya'll ought to stop talking start trying to catch up motherfucker

And all the people say
Try to catch up motherfucker

Lauryn said; money change a situation
Big said; it increase the complication
Kane said don't step, I ain't the one
Chuck said that uzi weigh a motherfuckin' ton
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me
Rockin' every stage in every place that it brought me
I'm awfully underrated, but came here to correct it
And so it ain't mistaken I'ma state it for the record

I am the opposite of wack, opposite of weak
Opposite of slack, synonym of heat
Synonym of crack, closest to a peak
Far from a punk
Ya'll ought to stop talking, start trying to catch up motherfucker

And all the people say
Try to catch up motherfucker

Oh, when they come for me
Come for me
I'll be gone
Oh, when they come for me
Come for me
I'll be gone
Oh, when they come for me
Come for me
I'll be gone

And all the people say
Try to catch up motherfucker
And all the people say
Try to catch up motherfucker
