There is no end game, so whisper the truth and pass on the blame
Just put us out of our misery
This defeat is a victory
We're burning out, we're fading away
A failed evolution
Is the problem the solution that they've been searching for?

We're waiting for the world to save itself
Cause nothing is built to last
We're writing our epitaph
So reset and start again
Cause we all know how this ends
Before long we'll be dead and gone
A thorn in the side of the earth
Where do you draw the line?
A flaw in the design
The rest is history
This defeat is a victory
We're burning out, we're fading away

We live in an infinite growth paradigm.
Nothing grows forever, it's not possible.
As a great, uh psychologist James Hillman wrote,
"The only thing that grows in the human body after a certain age is Cancer" and I think that, that's clearly what we're seeing at the end of human industrial civilization with the population approaching seven billion.

We're all guilty as sin
I feel it, I feel it under my skin
Always up in arms, without lifting a finger
Lifting a finger

We may be infinite, but this world is not
Something that we once knew, that we long forgot
That we long forgot

We're waiting for the world to save itself
Cause nothing is built to last
We're writing our epitaph
So reset and start again
Cause we all know how this ends
Before long we'll be dead and gone

We're all guilty as sin
I feel it, I feel it under my skin
Always up in arms, without lifting a finger
Lifting a finger

We may be infinite, but this world is not
Something that we once knew, that we long forgot
