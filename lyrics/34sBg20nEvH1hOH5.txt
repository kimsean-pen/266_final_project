I fall asleep
In front of the TV
So I forget
What I'm thinking

Oh, don't you wanna know?
Is it any easier?
Oh, don't you wanna know?
Is it fine to close your eyes?

We're going round and round and up and down
Turning something inside out
We driving from the backseat
You're holding on too tightly

We're going round and round and up and down
Turning something inside out
We driving from the backseat
You're holding on too tightly

The colors they merge, they scream
And shout

I watch my mind
Try and work things out
I think it's clear
But three days later it's wrong

But oh, don't you wanna know?
Is it any easier?
Oh, don't you wanna know?
Is it fine to close your eyes?

We're going round and round and up and down
Turning something inside out
We driving from the backseat
You're holding on too tightly

We're going round and round and up and down
Turning something inside out
We driving from the backseat
You're holding on too tightly

The colors they merge, they scream
And shout

Listen up (listen here)
Everybody scream out loud
Listen up (listen here)
Everybody scream out loud
Listen up (listen here)
Everybody scream out loud
Listen up (listen here)
Everybody scream now

We're going round and round and up and down
Turning something inside out
Round and round and up and down
Turning something inside out

Round and round and up and down
Turning something inside out
Round and round and up and down
Turning something inside out

We driving from the backseat
Holding on too tightly

We're going round... and round
(Turning something inside out)
We driving from the backseat
You're holding on too tightly
We driving from the backseat
You're holding on too tightly
