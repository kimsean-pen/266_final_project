Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
When the rainbow turns the clouds away
Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay

When the memories that linger into my heart
Memories that make my heart go cold
However some day they gonna live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
But when the rainbow turns the clouds away
Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay

When the memories that linger in my heart
Memories they gonna make my heart grow cold
Well, you know some day they gonna live again, sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
When the rainbow turns the clouds away
Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay, stay
