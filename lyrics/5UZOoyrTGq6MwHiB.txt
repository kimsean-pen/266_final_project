Thought that I was strong
I know the words I need to say
Frozen in my place
I let the moment slip away

I've been screaming on the inside and I know I can feel the pain
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
Say it's over
Yes it's over, but I need you anyway
Say you love me but it's not enough

Never meant to lie
But I'm not the girl you think you know
The more that I am with you
The more that I am all alone

I've been screaming on the inside and I know I can feel the pain
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
Say it's over
Yes it's over but I need you anyway
Say you love me but it's not enough

Not that I'm so different
Not that I don't see the dying light of what we used to be
But how can I forgive you?
You changed
And I'm a liar by your side
I'm about to lose my mind

'Cause I've been screaming on the inside and I know I can feel the pain
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
You've been dreaming if you're thinking that I still belong to you
And I've been dying 'cause I'm lying to myself

Say it's over
Yes it's over but I need you anyway
Say you love me but it's not enough
