There's a light inside us all
It only shines as bright as we are
And you're falling down so low
And we're worried for you
And we worry...

But even on our worst days
We were never quite like this
We've gone as far as we can go
They are crushing
No

At the heart of every fool
Is the hopeless, stupid tune
And there's this lingering, this ignorant feeling
That I'm just a fool
That I can see something

But even at your worst day
You were never bad as this
You've gone far as you can go
And I'm dying

You and your high horses...
