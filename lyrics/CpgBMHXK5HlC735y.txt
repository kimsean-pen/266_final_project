Hot flashes burning my brain
Your tongue lashing drive me insane
From New York City to LA
You're known as the hottest lay

Anya pink canopy gonna shackle ya' down
You crossed every back in town
From a cheri runaway to a bowery queen
Used up before yer sweet sixteen

Everyone knows you were caught with the meat in your mouth

Look for love on a one way street
Bedding down with every new band you meet
A stripping and a dancing and buying some downs
Support the latest sensation in town

And while you're performing on your leopard skin sheets
The roadies all keeping the beat
You fell asleep with the meat between your cavities
And a cas of water on the knees
