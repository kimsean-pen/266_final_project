Fell from the sky
We fell from the sky and started walking
Leavin' our footprints on the ground

It might be a prayer
Or maybe a piece of conversation
Wherever we go we make a sound

So I call your name, the only thing I know
Is I need you here, will you be gone forever?
All that I know, all that I know is we're here tonight
Turn off the lights

Let go for tonight baby
Let love in your life and be shown (turn off the lights)
Let go for tonight baby, who needs sleep tonight?
I need to let go, let go
Let go, let go, turn off the lights
Let love in your life baby, who needs sleep tonight?

I wanna drive
I wanna drive into the open
Lookin' for reasons I can't find

So I call your name, the only thing I know
Is I need you here, will you be gone forever?
All that I know, all that I know is we're here tonight
Turn off the lights

Let go for tonight baby
Let love in your life and be shown (turn off the lights)
Let go for tonight baby, who needs sleep tonight?
I need to let go, let go
Let go, let go, turn off the lights
Let love in your life baby, who needs sleep tonight?

I need to let go, let go
Let go, let go
I need to let go, let go
Before we're gone, gone, gone

So I call your name, the only thing I know
Is I need you here, will you be gone forever?
All that I know, all that I know
Is I need you here, will you be gone forever?

(Turn off the lights)
Turn off the lights
Let go for tonight baby
Let love in your life and be shown (turn off the lights)
Let go for tonight baby, who needs sleep tonight?
I need to let go, let go
Let go, let go, turn off the lights
Let love in your life baby, who needs sleep tonight?
Let go, let go
Let go, let go
I need to let go, let go
Before we gone, gone, gone
Fell from the sky
We fell from the sky and started walking
Leavin' our footprints on the ground
