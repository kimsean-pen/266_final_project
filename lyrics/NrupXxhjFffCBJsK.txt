(Never give in, never give in,
never give in, never give in, never give in)

I wouldn't wish this on just anyone
But you seem to share my impulse
I wouldn't take this from just anyone
But you seem to like the result

I'll connect the dots and you can tell me when to stop
But I'd rather keep on going than be something that I'm not

We're creatures of habit, we can't live without it
We don't have to answer to anyone
We're chasing the rabbit, like creatures of habit
And no-one else knows where we're coming from
And nothing's ever gonna change
'Cos I ain't gonna run away
There's no need to panic, 'cos you're just as tragic
We're creatures of habit, we don't have to answer to anyone

I'm not amused by just anything
But under the circumstances (never give in, never give in)
You be the recluse, I will defend you
When you've used up all your chances

I'll connect the dots and you can tell me when to stop
But I'd rather keep on going than be something that I'm not

We're creatures of habit, we can't live without it
We don't have to answer to anyone
We're chasing the rabbit, like creatures of habit
And no-one else knows where we're coming from
And nothing's ever gonna change
'Cos I ain't gonna run away
There's no need to panic, 'cos you're just as tragic
We're creatures of habit, we don't have to answer to anyone

We're creatures of habit, we can't live without it
We don't have to answer to anyone
We're chasing the rabbit, like creatures of habit
And no-one else knows where we're
coming from (never give in, never give in)
And nothing's ever gonna change (nothing will change)
'Cos I ain't gonna run away (I won't run)
There's no need to panic, 'cos you're just as tragic
We're creatures of habit, we don't have to answer to anyone

(Never give in, never give in,
never give in, never give in, never give in...)
