You got me forced to crack
my lids in two
I'm still stuck inside this rubber room
I gotta punch the clock that
leads the blind
I'm just another gear in the assembly
line - oh no
The noose gets tighter around
my throat
But I ain't at the end of my rope 'cause
I won't be the one left behind
Can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind
Tear down the rat racial slime
Can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind
Get it?
A routine injection, a lethal dose
But my day in the sun ain't even close
There's no need to waste
your prayers on me
You better mark my words
'cause I'm history
Yes indeed
You might beg for mercy to get by
But I'd rather tear this thorn
from my side
I won't be the one left behind
You can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind
Tear down the rat racial slime
Can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind
They swallowed thier daggers by
turning their trick
They tore my intentions apart
brick by brick
I'm sick of the jive
You talk verbal insecticide
They swallowed thier daggers by
turning their trick
They tore my intentions apart
brick by brick
I'm sick of the jive
You talk verbal insecticide
I won't be the one left behind
You can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind
Tear down the rat racial slime
You can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind
I said slave to the grind
Slave to the grind
Slave to the grind
