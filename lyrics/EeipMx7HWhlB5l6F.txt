Why am I in such a hurry
Always getting up too early
So fast, everything is blurry oh oh
It's like the clock is always racing
But my time is not for wasting
Someone else can do the chasing

Cause I'm chasing the sun
I'm chasing the sun
I'm chasing the sun
Won't miss out on the fun
Gotta get it while our hearts are young
I'm chasing the sun

Ooh ooh ooh.

On my pursuit of happiness
I realize that more means less
If I got love
then I am blessed oh why no
So I start living while I can

And hope the moment in my hands
I fly until I learn and land in my home

I'm chasing the sun
I'm chasing the sun
I'm chasing the sun
Won't miss out on the fun

Gotta get it while our hearts are young
I'm chasing the sun
Ooh ooh ooh.

Love the life I live
And I will live the life I love
Open up my eyes and I will take
Whatever comes
I'm chasing the sun
I'm chasing the sun
I'm chasing the sun
Won't miss out the fun
Gotta get it while our hearts are young
I'm chasing the sun
Ooh ooh ooh...
