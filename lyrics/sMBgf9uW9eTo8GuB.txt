We were worlds apart
So I fell from the stars
I travelled long and I travelled far
Then deep in the dark
I followed a spark
And it led straight to your heart

There'll be oceans for us to tread
There'll be bridges for us to mend
But I'll stick through it
Oh, I swear

There'll be mountains for us to climb
There'll be days when the sun won't shine
But I'll stick through it
Oh, I swear

I've got scars by great white sharks
But I swam fast and I swam hard
All these miles I've walked
All these stumbles and falls
They led me straight to your arms

But there'll be oceans for us to tread
There'll be bridges for us to mend
But I'll stick through it
Oh, I swear

There'll be mountains for us to climb
There'll be days when the sun won't shine
But I'll stick through it
Oh, I swear

There'll be so many years that pass
There'll be others with greener grass
But I'll stick through it
Oh, I swear

There'll be exits along the road
There'll be so many ways to go
But I'll stick through it
Oh, I swear
Oh, I swear
