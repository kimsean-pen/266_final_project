Waiting in line
Thought about leaving but for real this time
Some redesign of a classic theme of western scene

What everyone wants
Is the same thing that everyone wants
What everyone needs
Is a place to be what everyone else wants to be
What do you want to be

It could be the best in some wild wild ways
You could be the best in some wild wild ways
Isn't that the dream
Isn't that the dream

I'm chasing the sun
I'm chasing something even if it's been done
Follow the one
But at 66 I want to feel like this
Make me feel like this

It could be the best in some wild wild ways
You could be the best in some wild wild ways
Isn't that the dream
Isn't that the dream
Isn't that the dream
Isn't that the dream
