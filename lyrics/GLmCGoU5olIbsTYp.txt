Wild one won't you please come home
You've been away too long, will you?
We need you home, we need you near
Come back wild one will you?

How can we live without your love
You know that could kill you
How can we carry on
When you are gone my wild one?

Oh, sure you are a wild one
Oh, you are a wild one
Over and over and over and over

So you go your way
Wild one, I'll try and follow
And if you change your mind
I will be waiting here for you tomorrow

For I would beg for you
I would steal and I would borrow
I'd do anything at all, anything at all
To end this sorrow

My wild one
Oh, you are a wild one
Does Johnny go to [Incomprehensible]
Johnny go to [Incomprehensible]
There was no hope

Wild one
The gypsies warned of the danger
You can laugh and joke with friends
But don't you ever talk to strangers

Although their offers may be sweet
And I'd bet and I would wager
Away you'll stray and never come back
To those who love and made

Does Johnny go to [Incomprehensible]
Hey, you three [Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]
