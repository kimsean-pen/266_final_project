They, never broke my will
Cause my heart was strong
They won't justify
Condemnation, my vindication
But I will survive

(Aaah!)

Stood my ground 'till the end
Engaged the enemy protect my friends

No-stra-da-mus x2

Tamed the beast
They sent to kill
The congregation never broke my will

No-stra-da-mus x2

He has overcome
He can take the throne

Nostradamus - vindication
Nostradamus - is avenged
Nostradamus - our salvation
Nostradamus - he's avenged

I walked through fire to justify
Their inquisitions all condemned to die

No-stra-da-mus x2

Adversity on which I thrived
Destroys the altar now I'm vilified

No-stra-da-mus x2

He has seized the day
He is here to stay

Nostradamus - vindication
Nostradamus - is avenged
Nostradamus - our salvation
Nostradamus - he's avenged

Vindication,
He has been avenged

(Solo)

They never broke my will
Because my heart was strong
They can't justify
I will survive

He has overpowered
It's his finest hour

Nostradamus - vindication
Nostradamus - is avenged
Nostradamus - our salvation
Nostradamus - he's avenged

No-stra-da-mus x4
