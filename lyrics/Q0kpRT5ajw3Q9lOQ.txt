she won't miss you if you let her.
she won't miss you if you let her.
she won't miss you if you let her.
she won't miss you if you let her.
i'm not scared to stay inside a sealed envelope
envelope envelope envelope
i don't know why i live inside a goddamn envelope
envelope envelope envelope
she won't miss you if you let her.
she won't miss you if you let her.
she won't miss you if you let her.
she won't miss you if you let her.
i'm not scared to stay inside a sealed envelope
envelope envelope envelope
i don't know why i live inside a goddamn envelope
envelope envelope envelope
i'll shed no tears for the wasted year i spend waiting here,
don't know what i'll do when you leave and don't see you for a year.
