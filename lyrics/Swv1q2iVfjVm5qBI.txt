If I'm alone and you're free now we know nothings ever meant to be
But come along with me and be my secret side that no one sees.

I built a throne from a burden of need earth boy gets harvested or else recedes
So while you're cold numb my dream an ill chew rocks and splinters sob and scream.
Earth boy on your throne you sit alone.
