Warm
Warm

Never felt like this before
Got them, grey clouds hanging over me
Got caught up in the downpour
Need an umbrella to get underneath

And maybe I don't know what's meant for me
'Cause me and you haven't spoken in several weeks
You should know that I'm gonna play for keeps
Just need to weather the storm

Behind grey clouds is blue skies and sunrise, oh-oh
And God knows I have tried to visualize what it's like to feel warm
Behind grey clouds is blue skies and sunrise, oh-oh
And God knows I have tried to visualize what it's like to feel warm

Swept away by this whirlwind
As the ground turns to dust
Fate turns as we meet again
And the like turns to lust

But maybe I just know what's meant for me
'Cause me and you haven't spoken in several weeks
Should know that if this was meant to be
You should let it be known

Behind grey clouds is blue skies and sunrise, oh-oh
And God knows I have tried to visualize what it's like to feel warm
Behind grey clouds is blue skies and sunrise, oh-oh
And God knows I have tried to visualize what it's like to feel warm

Warm, warm
Warm, warm
Warm, warm
What's like to feel warm

Behind grey clouds is blue skies and sunrise, oh-oh
And God knows I have tried to visualize what it's like to feel warm
Behind grey clouds is blue skies and sunrise, oh-oh
And God knows I have tried to visualize what it's like, what it's like, oh

Warm (warm), warm (warm, warm)
Warm (warm, warm), oh
What it's like to feel warm
(Warm, warm), warm
(Warm, warm), warm
(Warm, warm), oh-oh
(What's it's like) to feel warm
