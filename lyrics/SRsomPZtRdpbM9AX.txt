I've got a brain in lefthand drive
I don't sleep otherside
I ride a bullet like I'm Steve McQueen
Each time I intervene
I got a Keith and the barn is jumping
It's alright we've got time
Got a radio hit in mind
Can't see through my blind

Every night and day I never dug it
in the USA
I delete myself

Got to get to know you gene by gene
You're my jellybean
Get out the shower round four fifteen
And I'm dead when I'm clean
Fatboy and the barn is pumping
It's alright its just tight
Got to get into a better buisness
Deep down happiness

Every night and day I never dug it
in the USA
I delete myself
