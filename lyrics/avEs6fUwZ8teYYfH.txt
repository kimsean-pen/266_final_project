I drift on a lonely lake
A lake of the darkness you forsake
I'm falling apart here in this life
I cannot find the things
That I've been searching for all this time

Hear the sound of my heart
Breaking down in tears
As I cave in to all my fears
It's a cruel world out there
I'm led astray in this wasteland and in the end
I know that I'm bound to descend

I'm lost on this lonely lake
I can't seem to find my way
I'm giving up on this life
'Cause I can't find the things
That I've been searching for all this time

Hear the sound of my heart
Breaking down in tears
As I cave in to all my fears
It's a cruel world out there
I'm led astray in this wasteland and in the end
I know that I'm bound to descend

Hear the sound of my heart
Breaking down in tears
As I cave in to all my fears
It's a cruel world out there
I'm led astray in this wasteland and in the end
I know that I'm bound to descend
