I won't love you forever
One day our senses will wither away
'Till we won't recognize each other
Oh, why do we bother?

There it is

I don't want you to love me
Like in the movies, like in the movies
And I won't love you forever
Like in the movies, I want the real thing

Lights out, we crawl in the darkness
Slow down, and show me what lust is made for
'Cause we will end up the same way
Anyway, any day now
There it is

I don't want you to love me
Like in the movies, like in the movies
And I won't love you forever
Like in the movies, I want the real thing
Yeah I want the real thing

I don't want you to love me
Like in the movies, like in the movies
And I won't love you forever
I want the real thing
