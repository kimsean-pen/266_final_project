Hello, hello?
Is anyone home?

Hello, hello?
Just pick up the phone
I opened up my life to you
I told you everything I knew

You listened so closely to
You listened so close when love was just a way out

But you're going deaf now
Yeah you turned your head around

Hello, hello?

Is anyone home?
Hello, hello?
Just pick up the phone
You'll be sorry to hear

I'm doing fine now
Sorry to hear

You're without me now

You blew up the world I built for us
Destroyed our secret universe

Threw out the trust I, put in you

Making me feel like I'd been used

And now I'm reminded

That I was just blinded
Hello, hello?
Is anyone home?
Hello, hello?
Just pick up the phone
You'll be sorry to hear
I'm doing fine now
Sorry to hear
You're without me now
I'm doing fine
You'll be alright
Maybe you'll think of me tonight

You're doing fine
And I'll be alright
Just give me time, yeah

Hello, hello?
Is anyone home?
Hello, hello?
Just pick up the phone
I don't wanna hear
You're doing fine now
Don't wanna hear
I'm without you now

I'm without you now

I'm without you.
