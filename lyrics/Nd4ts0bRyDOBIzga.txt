Honeybee,
go and tell a starling
to go and tell my darling
to hurry home to me.

Honeybee,
say I'm sad and lonely,
and say I'm wishing' only
his lovin' smile to see.

We had a fight and he's been gone
an hour by the clock upon the shelf.
He was right, but I'm too proud
to go and tell him so myself.

So, honeybee,
go and tell a starling
to go and tell my darling
to hurry home to me.
