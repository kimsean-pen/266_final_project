Don't touch that dial!

Television screams, your face turning green
Don't listen to the news
Don't know what you hear, they never make it clear
They like to keep your state confused

Propaganda time, the official line
You're hungry, you get fed
Everlasting smile, you must convey their style
But they're just a talking head, come on

Television voice don't give you any choice
You only hear the man
Don't take them in, you don't know where they been
'Cause it's a complex plan

They keep you nice and quiet, even control your diet
You're hungry, you get fed
Teach you to be meek, 'til all you are is weak
'Til you're just a talking head

Television screams, this ought to be a dream
Remember what I say
Don't be hypnotised by sugar coated lies
Don't switch it on today

It's the way things are from that pickle jar
You're hungry, you get fed
But if you play the game, you become the same
Another talking head
