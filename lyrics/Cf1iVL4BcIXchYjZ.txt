Baby I'm a moonchild
Made up out of stardust
Livin' on a blue planet
Lookin' for a cosmic love

We're stuck
Between the earth and sky
Livin' in a body
Controlled by our mind
While lookin' for a meanin'
In this life
Don't you think it's kinda, crazy
I think about it all of the time

But I'm alive
And that's a miracle
Gotta keep
Remindin' myself
I'm not separate
From this world
No I am one with the universe

Baby I'm a moonchild
Made up out of stardust
Livin' on a blue planet
Lookin' for a cosmic love

I've been all around
Lost in the space (Lost in a, space)
Tryna find a purpose
I'm tired of the chase (tired of the, chase)

Am I awake or dreamin'?
'Cause I can't tell what's real or what is fake
I hear destiny is calling
And she's screaming out my name

Baby I'm a moonchild
Made up out of stardust (Made up out of stardust)
Livin' on a blue planet
Lookin' for a cosmic love
(I'm lookin' for a cosmic love)

That's all I need to know
Yeah that's all I need to know

We might feel invisible
We're not just the physical
(Not just the physical)
There's got to be something more (There's got to be something more)
Something magical, spiritual
Supernatural

Baby I'm a moonchild (Baby, I'm a moonchild)
Made up out of stardust (Made up out of stardust)
Livin' on a blue planet
Lookin' for a cosmic love

(Baby I'm)
But I'm alive
And that's a miracle
Gotta keep
Remindin' myself
I'm not separate
From this world
No I am one with the universe

Baby I'm a moonchild
Baby I'm a moonchild
Baby I'm a moonchild
Baby I'm a moonchild

That's all I need to know
