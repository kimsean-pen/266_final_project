Face down on the ground,
You're tied and bound.
I split the neck,
Start to hack,
Then I pound.
She resists,
I splice the wrists,
Penetration makes her scream and now she twists.

She starts choking,
I'm stroking,
She begins to turn dark blue.

I slash into her skin,
Twist my knife,
Push it in.
Carve the slut,
Slice her face,
My steps not traced.
Rape the ditch,
Fill her ditch,
Her life encased.

My pleasure of being in her,
Rip open her thighs,
My lever sticks in her,
Gouging out the eyes,
She has become my victim,
Left there to die.

She starts choking,
I'm stroking,
She begins to turn dark blue.

Filthy whore,
She has become my victim,
Left there to die alone.
Skinned alive,
Rape the bitch,
Fill her ditch.

Shrieking out loud,
I felt her kicking,
Draining the blood,
Then I start licking.
I cannot control myself,
Bury her limbs,
There is no help.

She has become a dead victim.
