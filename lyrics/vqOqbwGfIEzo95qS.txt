Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.
Remember me to one who lives there.
He once was a true love of mine.

Tell him to make me a cambric shirt.
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.
Without no seam, nor needlework.
Then he'll be a true love of mine.

Tell him to buy me an acre of land.
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.
Between salt water and the sea strand.
Then he'll be a true love of mine.

Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.
Remember me to one who lives there.
He once was a true love of mine.
