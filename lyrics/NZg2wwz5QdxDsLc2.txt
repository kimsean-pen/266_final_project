Tenebra, tenebra... domina!
Tenebra, tenebra... danna me!
Let me open the dark portal
And so cross the crypts of ghostland... now...
Tenebra, tenebra... domina!
Tenebra, tenebra... danna me!
Let me see his face...
Furia cieca, caos in me...
Demoni...
Lead me to your horned beast named king...
I will call my fire, air, earthlords...
Shed my black tears... to stop inferno's breath!
Tenebra, tenebra... domina!
Tenebra, tenebra... danna me!
Tenebra... libera me!
