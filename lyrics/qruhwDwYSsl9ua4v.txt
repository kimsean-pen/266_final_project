Close my eyes and think of you
Go to sleep and dream of you
We don't get to be here long
I gave you the best of me
Loved you more than anything
But we don't get to be there long
We don't get to be here long

And though my heart may be in pieces
My eyes are still set on you
And though I can't keep it together
I know that you want me to

Oh I'm swimming in the grief
And there's no ache that could hold me down
And I don't want any relief
Cause I don't wanna let you go right now

Close my eyes and think of you
Go to sleep and dream of you
We don't get to be here long
(we don't get to, we don't get to, be here)
I gave you the best of me
Loved you more than anything
But we don't get to be there long

You're moans were a charity
They gave me more than I could need
Yeah I know you found the promised land
But I'm still here and I'm missing you

Close my eyes and think of you
Go to sleep and dream of you
We don't get to be here long
(we don't get to, we don't get to, be here)
I gave you the best of me
Loved you more than anything
But we don't get to be there long

When the day gone
And the fire is out
I wanna know that
I gave you up, I gave you all I had
When the day gone
And the fire is out
I wanna know that I gave you my everything

Close my eyes and think of you
Go to sleep and dream of you
We don't get to be here long
(we don't get to, we don't get to, be here)
I gave you the best of me
Loved you more than anything
But we don't get to be there long
Oh we don't get to be there long
We don't get to be there long
