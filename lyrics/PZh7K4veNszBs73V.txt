Oh how I saw her
And almost lived this way
If you weren't how I taught you
We'd both know what I said

With your head full of sorrow
You go on your way
All your life I can follow
And I'll lose you all the time

Oh how I saw you
And now she I could see
As you paint on an island
You saw inside of me

With your head full of sorrow
You crawl home and die
All your life I can't follow
But I'm with you all the time
