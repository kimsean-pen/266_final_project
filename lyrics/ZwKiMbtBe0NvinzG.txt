There are things you should know
And the distance between us seems to grow
But you're holding on strong
And, oh, how hard it is to let go, oh, so hard to let go
I'm waiting for your call and I'm ready to take your

Six six six in my heart
And I'm longing for your touch and I welcome your sweet
Six six six in my heart (oh, my love)
I'm losing my faith in you

But you don't want it to be true
But there's nothing you can do
There is no thing you can do - yes, I've lost my faith in you
Waiting for your call
And I'm ready to take your six six six in my heart

And I'm longing for your touch and I welcome your sweet
Six six six in my heart
Right here in this heart
Oh

Right here in this heart
I'm lonely
And I know it's too late
Oh, my god you're so lonely

I'm waiting for your call and I'm ready to take your
Six six six in my heart
And I'm longing for your touch and I welcome your sweet
Six six six in my heart

I'm ready for the fall and I'm ready to take your
Six six six in my heart
Longing for your touch and I welcome your sweet
Six six six in my heart
Right here in this heart
Right straight through my heart
Oh, right here in my heart
