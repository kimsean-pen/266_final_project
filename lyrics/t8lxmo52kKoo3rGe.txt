That you loved me so

Now you tell me since you've been away
There was something you've been dying to say
Yes, I thought you had eyes for me
But I never was quite sure, no, no

Mighty funny that you never called
Ain't it funny, boy, now that you're gone
That you say you're in love with me
Well, I find it, baby, hard to believe

Because I never knew it baby, never knew it, baby
I never knew it, baby, never knew it, baby
That you loved me so
Now I think about you every night

Said you wanted for us to have fun
What's the matter, boy, cat got your tongue
It's not easy to read your mind
So you better not take too long, no, no

Kind of silly just holding the phone
Ain't it silly that I'm all alone
When you should be here holding me
And making good love to me, oh so sweet

I never knew it, baby, never knew it, baby
I never knew it, baby, never knew it, baby
That you loved me so
Now I think about you every night

I said, I never knew it, baby, never knew it, baby
I said, I never knew it, baby, never knew it, baby
That you loved me so
Now I think about you every night

I knew somebody would love me
And satisfy this soul heart of mine, oh baby
You never should keep it from me
You gotta realize a girl would cry and lose her mind

I just never knew you loved me

That you loved me so

I said, I never knew it, baby, never knew it, baby
I said, I never knew it, baby, never knew it, baby
That you loved me so
Now I think about you every night

Now I think of you, think of you here whole day
And I think of you, think of you, you want me
Now that you loved me so
Now I think about you every night

I said, I never knew it, baby, never knew it, baby
I said, I never knew it, baby, never knew it, baby
That you loved me so
Now I think about you every night
