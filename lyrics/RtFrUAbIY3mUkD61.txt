Wooh Yeah

Let me down easy
Give me time
To get over you baby
mmhmmm

Let me down easy
Give me time
To get over you baby
mmmhmmm

Break it to me gently
If htis is goodbye
(baby say it slow)
Cause you taught me to love you
So come on girl and teach me not to love you before you go
Oh cause the fall from the top
To the bottom
Is such a sudden drop

So let me down easy
Give me time
To get over you baby
mmmhmm

Let me down easy
Give me time
To get over you baby
mmhmmm

Dont turn the lights out on me
Let the fell of love slowly fade away
Let your sweeter sister know
And youre loving arms a little tender day by day
Oh cause the fall
From the top
To the bottom
Is such a sudden drop

So let me down easy
Give me time
to get over you baby

Let me down easy
give me time to get over you baby
let me down easy
give me a lil love girl
give me time to get over you
just a little more time
let me down easy baby]
