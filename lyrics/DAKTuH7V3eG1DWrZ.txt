Well many years ago now I really can't be sure
That's when it all began then I heard that knock upon my door

And the wolfman's brother
The wolfman's brother
Came down on me

The telephone was ringing, that's when I handed it to Liz
She said, "This isn't who it would be if it wasn't who it is"

It's the wolfman's brother
The wolfman's brother
Comin' down on me

So I might be on a side street or a stairway to the stars
I hear the high pitched cavitation of propellers from afar

It's the wolfman's brother
The wolfman's brother
The wolfman's brother
The wolfman's brother
The wolfman's brother
The wolfman's brother
Comin' down on me

So with meaningless excitement and smooth atonal sound
It's like a cross between a hurricane and a ship that's run aground

It's the wolfman's brother
The wolfman's brother
The wolfman's brother
The wolfman's brother
The wolfman's brother
The wolfman's brother
Comin' down on - comin' down on me

The wolfman's brother, the wolfman's brother
Comin' down on me
Surely took more than he gave
