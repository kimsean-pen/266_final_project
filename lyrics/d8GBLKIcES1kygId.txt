"Warrior Inside"

I'm alive, a revolution, lies inside.
I'm alive, no longer, will this hate, divide and I'll stand.
I will fight, just to survive, I won't be denied, I'm a warrior, inside.

This is the war, between you and I, this is the end, to your evil lie.
And now you've pushed me to, the edge, this is the rage in every, tear I've cried.

I'm alive, a revolution, lies inside.
I'm alive, no longer, will this hate, divide and I'll stand.
I will fight, just to survive, I won't be denied, I'm a warrior, inside.

No, longer, will this fear hold strong, no, longer, will this fight prolong.
I'm bleeding through my skin, pushing through, the lies within.
I'm battling between tears and hate, that I have seen.

I'm alive, a revolution, lies inside.
I'm alive, no longer, will this hate, divide and I'll stand.
I will fight, just to survive, I won't be denied, I'm a warrior, inside.

This is the war (this is the war), between you and I!
This is the war (this is the war) and I will fight (I will fight)!

I'm alive, a revolution, lies inside.
I'm alive, no longer, will this hate, divide and I'll stand.
I will fight, just to survive, I won't be denied, I'm a warrior, inside.
