First off let me say you look so tired
Rest your head and shut your eyes
Empty ambition blankets the sky
I'm thinking 'bout another world
Tonight, you're right, you're right, you're right

So drop the gown, the game's over
Just push your face into the fight
And it breaks my heart
Like dancing up all night
Ride so high, we both start thinking
'Bout another world tonight
And it feels so wrong
Like nothing we've ever felt before
You're right, you're right, you're right

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
Close your eyes tonight
Baby, you can have it
Baby, you can have it

Oh baby, you're on me down to the bone
Soon you'll find I'm never gonna take you back home
Well, there's so much you never told me
And there's not much I wanna know
'Cause your pretty face will do just fine
You'll be the star of my every last show
Let's go for a long ride
I'll show you places you won't ever wanna leave

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
Stranger's candy, broken alleys, yeah, tonight

We could bring it all down
We could bring it all down
They think this body's a dead note
Dancing to the beat but they'll never see this corpse
Coming 'til it kills them
