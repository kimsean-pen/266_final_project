Give me oil in my lamp
Keep me burnin', burnin', burnin'
Give me oil in my lamp as I pray

Give me oil in my lamp
Keep me burnin', burnin', burnin'
Keep me burnin' till the break of day

Sing, oh, sinner, sing, oh, sinner
Sing, oh, sinner, to the king
Sing, oh, sinner, sing, oh, sinner
Sing, oh, sinner, to the king

Give me oil in my lamp
Keep me burnin', burnin', burnin'
Give me oil in my lamp as I pray

Give me oil in my lamp
Keep me burnin', burnin', burnin'
Keep me burnin' till the break of day
Keep me burnin' till the break of day
