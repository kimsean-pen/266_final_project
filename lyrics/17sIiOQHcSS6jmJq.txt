Just the other day somebody said to me
Hey, maybe you're just slightly schizophrenic
And a little out of reach my friend

I said yes that's partly true
But jokes aside I can explain
It's just my way of keeping track with living on this planet

Now then have you turned on your TV?
Have you seen reality?
Have you found the program that
You've spent your whole life looking for?

There's a girl in Camden town
Indecision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smile at me

How did it come to this?
How did it ever come to this?

All this noise and all these lights
All this talking through the night
All this expectation
Now it's making me neurotic

Tell me have I seen your face before?
I forgot to say hello
Thought I'd made it clear now
That I've always been a smiler, tell me

How did it come to this?
How did it ever come to this?
How did it come to this?
How did it ever come to this?

Sometimes it's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody said to me
Hey, maybe you are oh so slightly OCD
A little out of reach my friend

I said yes that's partly true
But jokes aside please just stay with me
It just my way of compartmentalising all the things I see

How did it come to this?
How did it ever come to this?
How did it come to this?
How did it ever come to this?
