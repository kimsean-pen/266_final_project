Why?
They wasted our filth
Stolen our bones
Turning our eyes, they're turning further to war

This is for knowing among silent trees
Kill those that run away
to delight and iron the birds

They're desolate, lonely
For most of the trees, there's hail on the leaves
to delight and iron the birds

His voice, so thick that love got buried
His voice, no boy, no boy, no play
Someday I'll rise, someday I'll play
Someday I'll rise, someday I'll rise
His voice, so thick that love, that love has gone away
No boy, no play

Windblown through the leaves
Can you still just dance then start singing?
I lay on the ground
Get lost once again in a tranquil sound

Revive the memory in real time, for me

The terrible sound
Is fading from paradise, is fading away...

And the hunger bout came
To delight and iron the birds
To seize our fate

Where are all the leaves?
We must dwell on the leaves

Tantalize, convince me that nothing's wrong
This all seems to say that I'll find a way
To shed my old skin and move on

For now I listen when they say nothing's wrong
Retreat to a place where memories erase
Ignore it as I have all along
