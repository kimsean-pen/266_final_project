Yeah, umm, ay yeah

I'm not your every day, around the way
Don't go bar-hoppin' chillin' on the block
On a cell phone frontin'
Never that, 'cause I'm not that kinda girl
(Not that kinda girl, no no no)
I need to know how you roll
And how you get down, no drama
Drop my money in the bank
Take me home and meet your mama
Can you handle that?
'Cause I'm that kinda girl
I'm that kinda girl

Boy you ain't impressin' me
With your jewelry, your designer clothes
Or the games that you try to play
Think you need to know, I got my own
Don't need you for your dough
Hearin' me, maybe then we can flow, let me know
Make me smile, maybe we can chill
Keep it real, show me something I can feel
'Cause I'm not your average ordinary type
Could you be that kinda guy I like?

I'm not your every day, around the way
Don't go bar-hoppin' chillin' on the block
On a cell phone frontin' (that's not me baby)
Never that, 'cause I'm not that kinda girl (I'm not that kinda girl)
I need to know how you roll
And how you get down, no drama
Drop my money in the bank
Take me home and meet your mama (meet your mama)
Can you handle that?
'Cause I'm that kinda girl
I'm that kinda girl

Everytime I be up at the spot, chilling with my crew
We'll be hanging out, get in a little late
You start bugging out
I dont think it's fair
You don't like the clothes I wear
How I do my hair
I don't really care
Cos I'm not for you
I got nothin' to prove
There can't be any us, if there can't be any trust
Nothing to discuss, no doubt
I'm not that kinda girl to let you play me out

I'm not your every day, around the way
Don't go bar-hoppin' chillin' on the block
(I'm not the one)
On a cell phone frontin'
(Not that kinda girl, no no)
Never that, 'cause I'm not that kinda girl
I need to know how you roll
And how you get down, no drama
Drop my money in the bank
Take me home and meet your mama
Can you handle that?
'Cause I'm that kinda girl
I'm that kinda girl

You might take me shopping, but I'm not your property
If I don't like it, I decided
I can make it on my own
As long as we disagree to agree
Down for you and you're down for me
Baby I'm what you want and we can build a love so strong

I'm not your every day, around the way
(Please believe me)
Don't go bar-hoppin' chillin' on the block
On a cell phone frontin'
Never that, 'cause I'm not that kinda girl
(You need to know the kinda girl I am)
I need to know how you roll
And how you get down, no drama
Drop my money in the bank
Take me home and meet your mama
Can you handle that?
'Cause I'm that kinda girl
I'm that kinda girl

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
I'm not that kinda girl
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Not that kinda girl
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Do you know what kinda girl I am?
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
I'm that kinda girl
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
