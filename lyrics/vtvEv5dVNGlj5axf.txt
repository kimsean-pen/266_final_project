I recall a time when we were lovers
Before you, I hadn't any other
when the bad times came along
I turned and you had gone
From the start, I loved you, I was wrong

Falling out, it's the end.
May as well have never been
The cards are up, the chips are all cashed in
You won't see me again,
Don't consider me your friend
Falling out, look away, it's the end

Always thought of you as my big brother
Never knew we couldn't trust eachother
Two faces I could see
As you shook my money tree
There's no more you and me
Let it be

Falling out, It's the end
And I lose another friend
The cards are up, the chips are all cashed in
You won't see me again
Don't consider me your friend
Falling out, look away, it's the end.

Falling out, It's the end
may as well have never been
the cards are up, the chips are all cashed in
You won't see me again
don't consider me your friend
Falling out, look away, it's the end
Falling out, look away, it's the end.
