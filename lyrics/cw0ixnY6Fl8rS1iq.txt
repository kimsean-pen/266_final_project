Stick your head into a paper bag
And see just what you find
Stick your head into a paper bag
And see just what you find

Was it you?
Was it me?
Or was it another type?

Stick your head into that bag
Four corners you may find
Was is the memory of every room
You've ever been inside?

Where you were standing
And staring
Just like before
You couldn't find the ceiling
You couldn't find the floor

Stick your head into that bag
