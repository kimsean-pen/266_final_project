Eeeee
Eeeee
Na na ne
Na na ne
Get freedom
Freedom
You'll know the way
Fading from me
And now we holding elation
Wasted agitation
Hesitation
Na na ne
Na na ne
Get freedom
Freedom
It's cold here, but he came in
He can close his eyes but he knows he can't fake it
And I will hold him dearly [?]
So be [?]
Hesitation
Light will come near
Light will come near
Light will come here
Light will come near
You got a beautiful guitar
And theres a notion where you are
You [?] and you run there you are
Light will come here
Light will come here
Na na ne
Na na ne
Freedom
Freedom
