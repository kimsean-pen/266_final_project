Hear me baby
I'm about to rain
And I'm so tired I can't get out of my own way
I'm at the height of my anxiety
I know you love me but I'm just seaching for security

Memories come around
And run their fingers through my hair
I can picture the future I see it so clear
Don't say another word if it's not what I want to hear

If it feels like a dream then it is one
Keep on, keep on, keeping on
Loving you is second nature to me now
I can't stop

Your love is something that I can't recreate
I see your face in every person that tries to compete
My heart is open and satisfied
The deepest shade of blue is waking up by your side

Memories come around
And run their fingers through my hair
I can picture the future I see it so clear
Don't say another word if it's not that I want to hear

If it feels like a dream then it is one
Keep on, keep on, keeping on
Loving you is second nature to me now
I can't stop
Let's leave nothing between the two of us
Keep on, keeping on
Loving you is second nature to me now
I can't stop

I found the nature in your eyes
Don't you leave me behind now
Swear I found heaven in your eyes
You know this second nature to me now

Reach out
Touch me and fill my head with little dreams
And seeing visions so clear it almost feels just like you're here

If it feels like a dream then it is one
Keep on, keep on, keeping on
Loving you is second nature to me now
I can't stop
Let's leave nothing between the two of us
Keep on, keeping on
Loving you is second nature to me now
I can't stop
