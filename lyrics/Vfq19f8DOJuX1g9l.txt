I can't control myself
Can't can't control myself myself
I can't control myself myself
Can't can't control myself

I get the feeling it's the end
And it burns

I am the stranger living in my skin
And it burns

Lies,
It's the language that I give
And it burns

Why,
Why does this existence feel like this
'Cuz it burns

I can't control myself
Can't can't control myself myself
I can't control myself myself
Can't can't control myself

Fire,
Hell is where I'll go to live
So I burn

I,
I can't even trust myself
And it burns

Eyes,
Reflecting the person that I am
And it burns

I,
I wish I could be somebody else
'Cuz it burns
