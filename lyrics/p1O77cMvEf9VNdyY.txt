What if you were the last one left?
What if you did this to yourself?
Don't leave me when the lights go out
Suppose you did this to yourself?

Oooh, don't leave me now
I'm here now, I'm your love
Oooh, don't leave me now
I'm here now, I'm your love

Who said you had a true born heart?
And who told you you were kind?
Don't leave me as the ocean rise
What if you did this to yourself?

Oooh, don't leave me now
I'm here now, I'm your love
Oooh, don't leave me now
I'm here now, I'm your love

Your leaves are turning black with rut
You're the mind of an egomaniac
You're the mind of an egomaniac
Even if the sun is fading black with smog
Like the mind of an egomaniac
You're the mind of an egomaniac

Why do you lie awake at night?
And why do you sometimes seem impolite?
Don't write your prayers on the wall
I know you're holy out of spite

Oooh, don't leave me now
I'm here now, I'm your love
Oooh, don't leave me now
I'm here now, I'm your love

Your leaves are turning black with rut
You're the mind of an egomaniac
You're the mind of an egomaniac
Even if the sun is fading black with smog
Like the mind of your egomaniac
You're the mind of an egomaniac

Oooh, don't leave me now
I'm here now (I'm here now)
I'm your love (I'm your love)
Oooh, don't leave me now
I'm here now (I'm here now)
I'm your love (I'm your love)
Oooh, don't leave me now
I'm here now, I'm your love

Oooh, don't leave me now
I'm here now (I'm here now)
I'm your love (I'm your love)
Oooh, don't leave me now
I'm here now (I'm here now)
I'm your love (I'm your love)

I'm here now (I'm here now)
I'm your love (I'm your love)
