Modern warfare of today
brings forth a new technology

Killing through scientific means
destroy the world with technology
Now we'll see what is to be
inescapability

Cloud masses concentrate
osmosis fills the sky, sky

Scattered remains, bodies left to decay
on this disease stricken earth, plague of Andromeda Strain

Affected by the gas
reduce them to subhuman form

As I glimpse at, swelled up corpses
infested with, radiated insects

Global chaos - Mass Confusion
The conclusion - of a dying world

Mankinds death is close at hand
the world is hanging by a strand
The key to an obliterated land
no one seems to understand

Andromeda Strain
