Traveling in the dark
through labyrinth of dreams
into a world unknown
into chaos without form
where souls collide on astral planes
where all summon the secret names

Enter the astral sabbat
Drown into the void
Succumb to the Omega
Under all seeing eyes

His face in the constellations
All devouring black hole
Hear the echoes of the end
Dance among the burning stars
Lucifer, the King of dreams
Appear in thousands of colors

Enter the astral sabbat
Drown into the void
Succumb to the Omega
Under all seeing eyes

Burning purple flames, come worship me
My heart is a coven, come unto me
Black celestial spheres, all within me
A chaotic trance, explode into space

Reveal the names untold
Entombed in stellar deep
From a world unknown
From chaos without form
Lucifer, the king of deep sleep
Appear in thousands of colors

Enter the astral sabbat
Drown into the void
Succumb to the Omega
Under all seeing eyes
