All my life I was swinging for the fence
I was looking for the triple
Never playing good defense
We were gunnin' for the glitter
Every hot and heavy hitter
She was never really there
So I couldn't really get her, said

Factually, I
I'm just a piece of it
Factually, I
The very least of it
Piece of work, I was really quite a jerk
Keeping score is such a bore
A busy mind could go berserk
Feast on this, I was fishing for a hook
So i took a little trip

When I opened up the book, I said
Factually, I
I'm just a piece of it
Factually, I
The very least of it
Factually, I
It's just the medicine
Makes you wanna cry
Why don't they let us in?

Be my wife

I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends

I've got a factory of faith
Late last night

I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends
I've got a factory of faith
I've got a factory of...

Crack your whip
She's confessing from the hip
She was good at getting there

But not as much for round trip
All this time
I was searching for a dream
I was slippin' in and out
Of every other sex machine
Factually, I
I'm just a piece of it
Factually, I
The very least of it
Factually, I
It's just the medicine
Makes you wanna cry
Why don't they let us in?
Be my wife
I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends
I've got a factory of faith
Late last night
I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends
I've got a factory of faith
I've got a factory of...
Be my wife
I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends
I've got a factory of faith
Late last night
I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends
I've got a factory of faith
I've got a factory of...
Faith
And love...
And Looo...
