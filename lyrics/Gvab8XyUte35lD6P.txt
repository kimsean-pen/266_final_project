In the forest, flowers may grow unseen
Flowers may grow unseen
Friends grow in my heart
Like evergreens
Friends like evergreens

But 'round these parts, I've got the name
Around these parts, I've got the name
I've got the name
My friends are people of ill-fame
Are people of ill-fame

In the pine woods, flowers may grow unseen
Flowers may grow unseen
Friends grow in my heart
Like evergreens
Friends like evergreens

If by some chance, there's no more wine
If by some chance, there's no more wine
There's no more wine
They'll tell me water suits them fine
Yes, water suits them fine

In the firm woods, flowers may grow unseen
Flowers may grow unseen
Friends grow in my heart
Like evergreens
Friends like evergreens

If by some chance, there's no more wine
If by some chance, there's no more wine
There's no more wine
They'll tell me water suits them fine
Yes, water suits them fine

In the black woods, flowers may grow unseen
Flowers may grow unseen
Friends grow in my heart
Like evergreens
Friends like evergreens
