I used your hands
On my head
I used your heart
To calm my bed
Well, I used to know, know, know
How not to fix it up
Aw, baby
Aw, baby

And then you two came along
With your safety and poise
To choose me a new colour
To wind around from waist
Snakes
Lovers
All in a race

Has me all borderline - re-erased
Has me all borderline - re-erased
Has me all borderline - re-erased
Has me all borderline - re-erased
Has me all borderline - re-erased
Has me all borderline - re-erased
Has me all borderline - re-erased

Roam
Dawn tunnel
Plowing the clouds
Found lawn tomb-ro
Only fools get gold
They show you films of all latent places
It's alright
I miss Mike Stipe
