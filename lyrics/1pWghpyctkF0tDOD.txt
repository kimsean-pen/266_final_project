Born of the sun, crashed to the earth
Tormented reviled, engorged hate from birth
Hellions the steed, blood's on the wing
Claws set to slice, vengeance he'll bring

Cremating the land in seek and destroy
Apocalypse slays, napalm he'll deploy
The beast of a god, eagled of his race
Prepared to onslaught and bare face to face

Across the divide, the threshold's in flames
The painkiller rises again

The scream of the demon, there's evil about
They've come to possess us, out, demons out

Blade of the wheel cuts deep in the bone
It's Gideon's quest to take Satan's throne
The critical mass and power that they wield
Exterminates all when vermin rebel

A maelstrom begins to disintegrate
And pulverize all in it's wake

The scream of the demon there's evil about
They've come to possess us, out, demons out

The scream of the demon, there's evil about
They've come to possess us, out, demons out

Demonizer
(Out, out, out, demons out)
Demonizer
(Out, out, out, demons out)
Demonizer
(Out, out, out, demons out)
Demonizer
(Out, out, out, demons out)
Demons out
