We have to carry on
We have to make it for us
But then never gonna make it
Let this go

As I look into your eyes and see you standing there
Tell me something
You're never gonna let this go

Step into your heart but you don't take it
Please don't leave it
And you're never gonna let this go

All I know
Is that you want to break it
I just want to say
Is that your feeling?
You know what you are?
Tell me why
Did you turn your back right to me
You drive me crazy!

We just carry on our relation that
We can't keep any more
But we have to make it for us 'cause I'm never gonna
Make it
If I see your mind without the wall of emotion
That I tore
I could get everything back
It's back to me just like that!

As I look into your face and see you smiling there
Show me anything
You're never gonna let this go

Maybe I was messed
You think maybe I was wrong
No way to change it
But you're never gonna let this go

All I know
Is that you want to break it I just want to say
Is that your feeling?
You know what you are? Tell me why
Did you turn your back right to me
You drive me crazy!

We just carry on our relation that we can't keep
Any more
But we have to make it for us 'cause I'm never gonna
Make it
If I see your mind without the wall of emotion that I tore
I could get everything back
It's back to me just like that!

All I know
Is that you don't want to break it
Please tell me why
Did you turn your back right to me
You drive me crazy
We just carry on our relation that we can't keep
Any more
But we have to make it for us 'cause I'm never gonna
Make it
If I see your mind without the wall of emotion that I tore
I could get everything back
This time, we will let this go!
