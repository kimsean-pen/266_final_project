While on the road to sweet Athy
Hurroo Hurroo
While on the road to sweet Athy
Hurroo Hurroo
While on the road to sweet Athy
A stick in the hand, A drop in the eye
A doleful damsel I heard cry
Johnny I hardly knew ya

Where are the eyes that looked so mild
Hurroo Hurroo
Where are the eyes that looked so mild
Hurroo Hurroo
Where are the eyes that looked so mild
When my poor heart you first beguiled
Why did ya run from me and the child
Johnny I hardly knew ya

We had guns and drums and drums and guns
Hurroo Hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
Hurroo Hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
The enemy never slew ya

Johnny I hardly knew ya
Where are the legs with which you run
Hurroo Hurroo
Where are the legs with which you run
Hurroo Hurroo
Where are the legs with which you run
When first you went to carry a gun
Indeed your dancing days are done

Johnny I hardly knew ya
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
Hurroo Hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
Hurroo Hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns

The enemy never slew ya
Johnny I hardly knew ya
You hadn't an arm, you hadn't a leg
Hurroo Hurroo
You hadn't an arm, you hadn't a leg
Hurroo Hurroo
You hadn't an arm, you hadn't a leg
You're a spinless, boneless, chickenless egg

You'll Have to be put with the bowl to beg
Johnny I hardly knew ya
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
Hurroo Hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
Hurroo Hurroo

We had guns and drums and drums and guns
The enemy never slew ya
Johnny I hardly knew ya
Im happy for to see ya home
Hurroo Hurroo
Im happy for to see ya home
Hurroo Hurroo

Im happy for to see ya home
From the Isle of Ceylon
Johnny I hardly knew ya
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
Hurroo (hey) Hurroo (hey)
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
Hurroo (hey) Hurroo (hey)
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
The enemy never slew ya
Johnny I hardly knew ya
