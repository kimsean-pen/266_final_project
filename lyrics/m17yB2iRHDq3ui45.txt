Mel C:
There will come a time,
I know I'm gonna need.
Someone I can trust, someone who'll fight for me,
That's the way I love.

Emma:
This is my time to work things out,
What i want from this life.
There will be someone out there for me,
That's the way I love.

It doesn't really matter whoever you are (Mel C)
Don't matter where you go. (Emma)
Just make sure you're there to answer when (Mel C)
love comes around, (Mel C)
Don't be surprised, (Emma)
When love knocks at your door. (Emma / Mel C)

All:
You're the prayer that I take,
You're the smile on my face
Every time I breathe in,
Brings me warmth from within.
When you touch me I start believing,
Loving is like Oxygen.

Victoria:
Even when we're so far apart,
I still feel you in my heart.
'Cos you've given me the greatest gift of all,
That's the way I love.

Mel B:
The way I love ain't easy,
But it could never be for me.
The situation seems so insane,
It's all about feeling without insecurities,
That's the way I love.

It doesn't really matter whoever you are (Mel C),
Don't matter where you go. (Emma)
Just make sure you're there to answer when (Mel C)
love comes around, (Mel C)
Don't be surprised, (Emma)
When love knocks at your door. (Emma / Mel C)

All:
You're the breath that I take,
You're the smile on my face.
Everytime I breathe in,
Brings me warmth from within.
When you touch me I start believing,
Loving is like oxygen.
You're in every breath I take,

Imagine a life without love,
I'd be so afraid(sooo afraid)
Cos the love that we share would be,
hard to replace,
Baby hold me and never leave me.
This love is my oxygen,
This love is my oxygen.

Mel C:
Open your heart,
Take a deep breath,
Stop searching, start believing.

Emma:
Make sure you're there to answer when love
comes around,
Don't be surprised.
When true love knocks at your door.

All (with Emma in Background)
You're the breath that I take,
You're the smile on my face.
Everytime I breathe in,

You're in every breath that I take.

Imagine a world without love,
I'd be so afraid (sooo afraid).
cos the love that we share, would
be hard to replace.
Baby hold me and never leave me,
This love is my oxygen,
This love is my oxygen.
