I want your body
Won't live without it
so turn up the party
I'm feeling naughty

Stay close to me
I'll be all that you need
Don't deny what you want, baby.
I want your body

All I desire you
relight the fire
just come with me, come with me

Just gonna let it go tonight
all I want is you
Thousand shades of blue
Dancing in your eyes.

I'm just gonna let it go tonigh
I just wanna be
hold you close to me
Dancing in your eyes

I want your body
dinguiringuirindinguiringuirin!
I want your body
dinguiringuirindinguiringuirin!

It's getting hotter
the beat is louder
I know you want me
and I want your body

Stay close to me
I'll be all that you need
Don't deny what you want baby.
I want your body

All I desire
you relight the fire
just come with me, come with me

Just gonna let it go tonight
all I want is you
Thousand shades of blue
Dancing in your eyes.

I'm just gonna let it go tonight
I just wanna be hold you close to me
Dancing in your eyes
I want your body
