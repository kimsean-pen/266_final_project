I made it there just in time
To say my last goodbye
Heaven stole her for glory
While I'm left on the other side

I know, I know, I know I'll see you
One day far far away
In a beautiful world where I hope to dance with you
We'll be together just me and you, me and you
Me and you

Can you hear me
People stop and stare where ever we go
Cause we live our lives right on the road
Imagine all the different countries, faces and places
But I remember yours the most, yeah I do

I know, I know, I know I'll see you
One day far far away
In a beautiful world where I hope to dance with you
We'll be together just me and you, me and you
Me and you, me and you
Me and you

To see your face again
Faith don't leave me
To hear your voice again
Faith don't leave me
To see your face again
Faith don't leave me
To hear your voice again
Faith don't leave me
Please don't leave me
Please don't leave me
Oh don't leave me

I know, I know, I know I'll see you
One day far far away
In a beautiful world where I hope to dance with you
We'll be together just me and you, me and you
Me and you, me and you
Me and you
