Don't go far, don't go put your feet in
standing soul scratched wrestling with heartbeats
if I belong with everyone, everyone I've ever known
I belong with everyone, everyone I've ever known is here,
With me.
Making up, lovers on their own tonight
need to see how it's done
so I can change inside
I belong with everyone, everyone I've ever known
I belong with everyone, everyone I've ever known is here,
With me.
Everything that comes together
everything that falls apart in here
in every single living thing.
Everything that comes together
everything that falls apart in here
in every single living thing.
Found on out forgotten where to hide,
sleeping secret moved enough to end up outside

If I belong with everyone, everyone I've ever known
i belong with everyone, everyone I've ever known is here,
With me.
Few less wonders, less to keep repeating
stay here undone rattling and beating.
if I belong with everyone, everyone I've ever known
I belong with everyone, everyone I've ever known is here,
With me.

Everything that comes together

As I'm looking falling lonely,
some things coming and I can't seem what it is,
maybe if you've got someone you should let me know
maybe if you've got someone you should let me know.
