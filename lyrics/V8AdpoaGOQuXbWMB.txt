I will break with you
For your body to be freed and pleased
Take the weight of you
For your gravity to be erased

Just a phantom muse
What was the form, the flesh, the feet, the face?

Come to life, my hungry arms are begging you
But what more can you do?

Labor reveal before our eyes
Into our ears
Unfurl with light
The stars around us disappear
Just what is torn
What comes alive inside of us

Labor reveal
Before our eyes into our ears
Unfurl with light
The stars around us disappear
Just what is torn
What comes to life inside of us

Come to
Come to
Come to life
Come to
