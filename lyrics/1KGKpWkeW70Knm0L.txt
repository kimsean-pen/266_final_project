Ever since the first time I laid eyes on you
I saw the truth
No questions just proof
They may talk, but I ain't hear a thing they said about you
Ever since the first time we laid
Everybody want details, but don't say nothin'
I won't say nothin' if you don't say nothin'
Cause this is between us
Yeah we gon' fight
But I'mma love you till it's alright
Ain't gon' find these answers outside

Boy we don't need nobody's advice
Give me a shoulder to cry on
And I'll be alright
I'll be the one you rely on
This love

Ain't none of your friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
It's ours, all ours, nobody elses
None of your friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
Ain't none of your friends business
Ain't none of my freinds business
Boy it's ours, baby it's ours

Don't ask me "how was the sex?"
That's between me, my man and our bed
Plus I know how you hoes get
I ain't tryna lose a friend telling you how my man do the best
And the same goes for you baby, I know how niggas do
Your friends be talking crazy, acting like bitches too

Ain't none of your friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
It's ours, all ours, nobody elses
None of your friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
Ain't none of your friends business
Ain't none of my freinds business
Boy it's ours, baby it's ours

So we don't need nobody else
All we need is us
Opinions getting raw baby
Fucks a bowl of trust
The [?], the love
You're scared, me too
He hurt me, she hurt you
You're taking a risk with me too
