Reaching out as the angels stare
Crying out in loving memory
Holding on for a final prayer
Crying out in loving memory

The cold bites in the dead of the night
It penetrates your bones
Uneasy feeling that something ain't right
And now you're all alone
Footsteps creeping up from behind
Your worst nightmare's coming to life
You've gotta run or stand and fight
Your time has come
(should have seen this coming)
Start coming to terms that your life is over, over

Reaching out as the angels stare
Crying out in loving memory
Holding on for a final prayer
Crying out in loving memory

Time stops, eternity waits
Blood flows so cold
Blinded by darkness being so bright
Now the truth unfolds
In death there is nothing divine
Salvations' living to die
You cannot run, you cannot fight
This can't be won
(should have seen this coming)
Start coming to terms that your life is over, over

Reaching out as the angels stare
Crying out in loving memory
Holding on for a final prayer
Crying out in loving memory

(should have seen this coming)
(there's a fear in your eyes)

Start coming to terms that your life is over, over

Reaching out as the angels stare
Crying out in loving memory
Holding on for a final prayer
Crying out in loving memory
Reaching out as the angels stare
Crying out in loving memory
Holding on for a final prayer
Crying out in loving memory
