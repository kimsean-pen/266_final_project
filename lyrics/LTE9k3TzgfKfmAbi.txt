I am Pluto
Never forget, never forget
Okay

I'm so groovy
I got power
I'm so groovy
I got power
That's your bitch?
I just bought her
Oh that's your bitch
I just bought her

Percs and molly
Plain Jane
I just fucked her face
I don't know her name

Tom Brady, Tony Snow
I just backdoored your ho
Goin' brazy at the jeweler
I just suicide my doors
Candy yams in the 'partment
Living like Nino
I just come here, let me breathe
VVS's on my sleeves
Pure molly, codeine
Blind your eye with my ring
You ain't ever gon' to see me
I get Stella McCartney
High fashion
John Madden
Bisex
No relation
Bought the jet
60K
Austin Power
M.I.A
Steven Seagal
Hard to kill
Stuff cigars
Hide your broad
She photoshopped
I'm photogenic
I just bent the Bentley
Did a U-turn
Duck the cops
Serving rocks
Made it to the top, uh huh
Fucking going platinum

I'm so groovy
I got power
I'm so groovy
I got power
That's your bitch?
I just bought her
Oh that's your bitch
I just bought her

Percs and molly
Plain Jane
I just fucked her face
I don't know her name

I'm the last don, I'm the last con
Done turned it up to an icon
Pimpin' hoes nigga ugh
Thoughts exposed niggas huh
Paper tags on the yacht
I just smashed in the clouds
Thousand bags in the clouds
Louis rag, wipe me down
Cash king on a clown
So prestigious, so profound
Cash cloud, let me live
50 cars at the crib
Private dinners on the leer
VTS's when I steer
Instant glam on my ear
Outer space when I appear
Promethazine in my seal
A yellow bone in the rear
Dopple god, I'm in here
Fuck your squad, they some queers
My conversation bringing mills to ya
I get my brother bring the bail to ya
Killas on the right and the left to ya
Gang gang, whatever's left of ya

I'm so groovy
I got power
I'm so groovy
I got power
That's your bitch?
I just bought her
Oh that's your bitch
I just bought her

Percs and molly
Plain Jane
I just fucked her face
I don't know her name
I don't know her name
(I don't know her name)

Sitting in the vert
Got a lotta dirt
Courtroom flow
Now I'm sitting courtside with your ho
Addy's work miracles
Benji's subliminals
Uptown Lenox
All about the Benji's
Pour a little Henny
Totin' the semi
Making love with my diamonds on
Diamonds on honeycomb
Hit 'em with the stick
I just copped the deuce
Syrup like Denny's
Bitch brown like a penny
Total it up in one minute
Out of the country all hidden
Playing in with the trenches in a suit
Armani got me with the juice
Made a bad bitch my masseuse
Take a little stress off the crew

I'm so groovy
I got power
I'm so groovy
I got power
That's your bitch?
I just bought her
Oh that's your bitch
I just bought her

Percs and molly
Plain Jane
I just fucked her face
I don't know her name
I don't know her name
(I don't know her name)
