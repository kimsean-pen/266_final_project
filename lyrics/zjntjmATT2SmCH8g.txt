I felt like I was the one who should fix everything
The impossible weight of my conviction
Crushing my feeble shoulders
There was nothing to be done but I struggled on

Scratching and clawing myself out of the hole
Gasping for air in the midst of the black smog
The curse of the dreamer

The torment of hope
It's much easier to fall back with your eyes closed

Victory is never painless
Obstruction to the path leads to the new path
Find the route to glory
You can't stray if there is no defined way

Create your own morality
Only you can judge yourself
