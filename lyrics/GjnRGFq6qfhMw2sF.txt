Rejoice
Flower of worms begats the sword shown the world of perfidy
Rejoice
Awakened now and unmerciful
You shall have all nations in derision
Becoming the catalyst of indignation
March towards wicked transformations
Slither from mine pallet that I might maintain your living ash
Living ash
Consume them with your fire
Rejoice
Flower of worms begats the sword shown the world of perfidy
With poisoned arrows
Consume them that they may not be
Enveloping them with delicious suffering
Rejoice
Flower of worms begats the sword shown the world of perfidy
Consume them that they may not be
And deliver much agony
The mass crucifixion of the sons of Adam
Dispatched by ignious ophidian
Constained abyssal order
Announcing the true fruits of the fall
Become the catalyst of indignation
Rejoice
And with terrible and tyrannical death
Oh, restore us again
