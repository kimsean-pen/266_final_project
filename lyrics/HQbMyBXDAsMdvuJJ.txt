I feel the fear take hold
Reside in darkness, thrive where most won't go
Adrift, I curse this gift
And hope you'll never know

Feel like a psychotic break comin' on
Snapping two by fours
Punching holes in dry wall

Feel like a psychotic break comin' on
Chalking up my dead friends
And loved ones long gone

I feel the fear take hold
Reside in darkness, thrive where most won't go
Adrift, I curse my gift
And hope you never know

Feel like a psychotic break comin' on
Snapping two by fours
Punching holes in dry wall

Feel like a psychotic break comin' on
Thinking 'bout my dead friends
Whose voices ring on
