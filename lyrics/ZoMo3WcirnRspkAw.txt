I'm taking those pills just to forget it
Oh, yes, forget the memories
Oh, no
Stuck in my head again in need of medicine

It's a long way up when you are down
There's no way out when you feel alone
When you feel alone?
I let it all go, go, go

I wash it down my throat to get myself up
Left you a note what it's all about
What it's all about?
I let it all go, go, go

You give me the look give me the look could I give It up?
You wanna know you wanna know what I think about

Could I let go, go?

I'm taking those pills just to forget it
Oh, yes, forget the memories
Oh, no
Stuck in my head again in need of medicine
Can you forgive me?
Oh, why are you still by my side?
Oh, yes, for you I stay alive
But I would rather die

Translate it into words
Would scare you off
This is how I feel I can let you see

I can let you see
I let it all go, go, go

Well I drink behind closed doors
Won't see my flaws hide what I can to be your superman

I let it all go, go, go

You give me that look give me that look I tell you that it's okay
You wanna know you wanna know
I don't know what to say

I can't feel my face

I'm taking those pills just to forget it
Oh, yes
Forget the memories
Oh, no
Stuck in my head again in need of medicine
Can you forgive me?
Oh, why are you still by my side?
Oh, yes, for you I stay alive
But I would rather die
Alive, alive, alive, alive
Stuck in my head again in need of medicine

The demon is tamed by me but I feel how it's catching up following
A part of my soul my shadow surrounds me wherever I go

The demon is tamed by me but I feel how it's catching up following
A part of my soul my shadow surrounds me wherever I go

I'm taking those pills just to forget it
Oh, yes, forget the memories
Oh, no
Stuck in my head again in need of medicine

Can you forgive me?
Oh, why are you still by my side?
Oh, yes, for you I stay alive
But I would rather die

Alive, alive, alive, alive
Stuck in my head again in need of medicine
Alive, alive, alive, alive
Stuck in my head again in need of medicine
