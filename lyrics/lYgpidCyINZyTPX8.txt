I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons to keep on, keepin' on
Got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day, I woke up and found that you were gone

Darkness all around me, blackin out the sun
Old friends call me but I just don't feel like talkin to anyone
Emptiness has found me and it just won't let me go
I go right on livin' baby, but why I just don't know

You're so strong
Got to keep on, keepin' on
You're so strong
Got to keep on, keepin' on

Now reality don't do me no good
'Cause our misunderstanding is too well understood
Such a sad, sad season when a good love dies
Not a day goes by when I don't realize

I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons to keep on, keepin' on
I got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day I woke up and found that you were gone

I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons to keep on, pushin' on
I said, I got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day I woke up and found that you were gone

I've really got to use a little imagination
Got to think of good reasons to keep on, keepin' on
I got to make the best of a bad situation
