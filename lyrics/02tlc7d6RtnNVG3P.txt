I got so much time today
I got hopes and dreams and plans all yet to be made
So get out the way
'Cos I'm coming through now
I got something to do
And I'll try
As I might
To keep up with the light
'Til I'm into bed for the night

I got so much more to say
I got books and tapes and canvas bearing the weight
But they're not arranged
'Cos it takes too long and
I'm still moving on
But I don't
Even know
Where I should be trying to go
So I guess I'll follow my nose

And I can't help but think about
If the sun ever stays down
Will I notice or will I
Just be sitting around
Ticking a list off
Rueing what I said wrong
But dawn still greets my windowpanes
And as long as I shall
Wake up in the morning
I got plans

I got so much time today
I got so much time today
I got so much time today
I got so much time
