Well, I can't quit you baby
But I got to put you down for awhile
Well, you know, I can't quit you baby

But I got to put you down for awhile
Well, you know you messed up my happy home, baby
Made me mistreat my only child

Yes, you know I love you, baby
My love for you I'll never hide
Oh, you know I love you, baby

My love for you I'll never hide
Yes, you know I love you, baby
Well you just my ordered one size

Well, I'm so tired I could cry
I could just lay down and die
Oh, I'm so tired I could cry

I could just lay down and die
Yes, you know you my only darling
You know you my desire

When you hear me moaning and groaning
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh, when you hear me moaning and groaning

You know it hurts me deep down inside
When you hear me holler, baby
Oh, you know your my desire
