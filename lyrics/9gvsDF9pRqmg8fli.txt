Who's the victim now?
Stand up and take a bow, a bow
Face right, face left
Face everyone you disrespect

So who's the asshole now?
Holier-than-thou, you're not
'Cause baby's got a black soul, got a black soul
Got a black soul

You made a mess of your life
And you been burned once or twice
Now you play roulette with the watergun

Wake up
Pull yourself together
Speak up
'Cause no one heard your name
Errupt
It's better late than never
And if I take forever to put you back together

Face right, face left
Face everyone you disrespect

Now their on theirfeet
To watch you double down hard and take it too far
And you know you're in too deep
'Cause you're running out of time and you're talking in your sleep
Baby's got a black soul
Baby's got no control
Baby's got a black soul, got a black soul
Got a black soul

You made a mess of your life
And you been buried alive
Now you play roulette with the watergun

Wake up
Pull yourself together
Speak up
'Cause no one heard your name
Errupt
It's better late than never
And if I take forever to put you back together

Oooh, oooh
Wake up
Pull yourself together
Speak up
'Cause no one heard your name
Errupt
It's better late than never
And if I take forever
Wake up
Pull yourself together
Speak up
'Cause no one heard your name
Errupt
It's better late than never
And if I take forever to put you back together
