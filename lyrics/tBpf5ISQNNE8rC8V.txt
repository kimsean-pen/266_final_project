Nah na-na na-na-na-na na-nah.
Whoo-hoo!
Kissin'! Hee!
Dog-gone lover!
Go-on boy.
Mmmm-hmmm!
I watched you on the floor
Cheek to cheek.
She's getting to you.
You didn't see
Her eyes on me-no.

She looked right through you.
(Before you make,)
Before you make
(A big mistake.)
Remember
That looks can fool you baby, hee!

There's something I would sure appreciate

(If-a you can keep a secret.)

Baby loves me

Though she never shows she cares.
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me.)

Baby loves me

Though she acts like I'm not there
(That doesn't mean she dosen't love me-Ooo,)

If they ask her
Tell 'em that we're just good friends.
Dah! Chika-chika-chika-ah!

Just good friends.
Ah! Chika-chika-ah!

(Non-non doo-doo...)

Hee! Aaow!
Just good friends.

You better take advice
Never trust first impressions.
I tried to hide this affair.
From their suspicions.

So even if she's asking you to stay
You better know where you stand.
Baby loves me
Though she never shows she cares.
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me.)
M-ma-baby loves me
Though she acts like I'm not there
(That doesn't mean she dosen't love me-Ooo,)
If they ask her
Tell 'em that we're just good friends.
Yes.
Just good friends.
Root-do-do-do.
Just good friends.
Listen up
Hee!
We've got a problem here.
I can see the signs
I guess the lady
Is still making up her mind!
(Say we're just good friends)
Baby loves me
Though she never shows she cares.
No you won't see her kiss and hug me.
(Just good friends)
My baby loves me
Though she acts like I'm not there.
You doggone lover!
Hee!
Aaow!
No-no-no-no-no!
My baby loves me
Though she never shows she cares.
Hee! Hee!
She dosen't kiss and hug me!
(Just good friends)
My baby loves me.
She love me, she love me.
Hee! Hee! Hee!
Whoo-hoo!
My baby dosen't see me!
My baby dosen't see me!
My baby dosen't
Baby dosen't

Ahh!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

Baby loves me.
She love me, she love me, she love me.
Hee!
Hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
(Non-non doo-doo)
