There we were on the road again
I think about it every now and then
Doesn't matter who wrote this one
Cause it's on tape and the song is sung
Every time I pick up a pen
The same stories start flowing again
At the touch she's still in my mind
What can you do?
Will the road, it ever get to you
I guess a home is only where you lie

So take what you get
And what comes later we'll just forget and
The face is the same
When he's scrounging for pocket change
I can't help but laugh out loud
To see your stupid face in the crowd
And it takes me away

Every trick is the slight of the hand
And you can't pull one over on this man
Cause he's seen it all before
Don't matter what you done cause he's done it before
Supposed to think you're not for me
And all I need is to be free
And the music will take them away
What can you do?
Will the road, it ever get to you
I guess a home is only where you lie

So take what you get
And what comes later we'll just forget it
The face is the same
When he's scrounging for pocket change
I can't help but laugh out loud
To see your stupid face in the crowd
And it takes me away
Oh... takes me away
