Lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts us up
Let me hear you sing it
Lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts up
So when the last light fades

Shine on, shine on, young love
You hold my hands and I'll hold yours
Then life won't feel so wrong
I know you're hurting like I am
I know your heart's in your hands
We share a life so bleak
With broken memories

Shine on, shine on, young love
You lit the fires in my heart, and I won't give that up
So shine on, shine on, young love
You know we're all sinking together, but this lifts us up

Lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts us up
Let me hear you sing it
Lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts us up
So when the last light fades

Shine on, shine on young love
We'll burn these fires bright
Let's blaze our past into the night
Because it's been too long
And we have been too down
So now it's sink or swim
And we're too strong to drown

Shine on, shine on, young love
You lit the fires in my heart, and I won't give that up
So shine on, shine on, young love
You know we're all sinking together, but this lifts us up

I've felt as helpless as you
Felt the will to give in
Let your heart open up
Let the healing begin
Find your way to the light
And fight the will to give in
It's sink or swim
And we're too strong to drown
It's sink or swim
And we're too strong to drown

We'll take our time and make a change
This is our chance to sail away
We'll take our time and make a change
This is our chance, so let the last light fade

Shine on, shine on young love
You lit the fires in my heart, and I won't give that up
So shine on, shine on young love
You know we're all sinking together, but this lifts us up

Shine on, shine on, lifts us up
You lit the fires in my heart and I won't give that up
So shine on, shine on, lifts us up
You know we're all sinking together, but this lifts us up
