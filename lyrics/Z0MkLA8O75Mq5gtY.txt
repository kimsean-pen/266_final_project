No turning back now
I'm moving ahead toward the way out (the way out)
Don't you hate how
We get left behind in the fallout (fallout)

Take a breath and take heart
Instead of pulling apart
When you find yourself back at the start

Every part of me
Catches on fire underneath
When I ignite, you'll see
Maybe I can light the way
I can light the way back to me
Back to me

I won't stand down
As I feel the ground begin to crack now (to crack now)
So I cry out
The same call to arms but with a new sound

Take a breath and take heart
When you are falling apart
And you don't even know where to start

Every part of me
Catches on fire underneath
When I ignite, you'll see
Maybe I can light the way
I can light the way back to me

Let hope be everything that you need
To march to a victory (victory...)
When you can't feel the difference between
An inch and infinity

(Every part of me
Catches on fire underneath)
Every part of me (part of me...)
Catches on fire underneath (underneath...)
When I ignite, you'll see (you will see...)
Maybe I can light the way
I can light the way

Every part of me
Catches on fire underneath
When I ignite, you'll see
Maybe I can light the way
I can light the way back to me
Back to me...
