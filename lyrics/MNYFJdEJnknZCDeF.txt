Walk before you see us walking
Talk before you hear us talking
Hold before we flee off holding, holding
Cry and all the roughens crying, crying

If you are willing then drink the loving cup
Join the falling stars
Who never cut wiser
If you are willing then drink the loving cup
Join the falling stars
Who never cut wiser

See...

Foxes what we are when releasing, leasing
What draws us in this feeling, feelings
From the stops of makeup crumbling, crumbling
And all the fancy dresses floating, floating

If you are willing then drink the loving cup
Join the falling stars
Who never cut wiser
Of all the people
We are the saddest ones
We're just falling stars that never cut
Of all the people
We are the saddest ones
We're just falling stars who never cut

Walk,
(Walk in, step in, step into control)
Walk,
(Walk in, step in, step into control)
Walk,
(Walk in, step in, step into control)

If you are willing then drink the loving cup
Join the falling stars
Who never cut wiser
If you are willing then drink the loving cup
Join the falling stars
Who never cut wiser
