Oh, far away
There lies a dream
We're all seeking
It's locked away
The key hangs near
Our hands are tired

And far away
In darkest days
We are living
I call your name
Too wrapped in lies
You don't hear me

So far away
Near shores pf deep
Empty oceans
There lies the pearl
There lies the dream
And our conscience

We'll rise above
We'll rise above all the killing
We'll rise above
We'll rise above while you're sleeping

Still far away
There lies a dream
We're all seeking
Still locked away
The key hangs near
Our hands are tired

We'll rise above
We'll rise above
While you're sleeping
We'll rise above
We'll rise above all the killing
