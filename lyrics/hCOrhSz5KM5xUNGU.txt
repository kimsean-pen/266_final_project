Walking down the street
Every type of person I meet
Living down here
Cruising everywhere
Just to get in your nightmares

I love LA
I love LA
I love LA
I don't wanna leave today

Talking to a friend
He said he'd never ever wanna
Ever come back again
I call him on the phone
Put a quarter in
He can listen to my ringtone

I love LA
I love LA
I love LA
I don't wanna leave today

I love LA
I love LA
I love LA
I don't wanna leave today

I love LA
I love LA
I love LA
I don't wanna leave today

LA
LA
LA

LA
LA
