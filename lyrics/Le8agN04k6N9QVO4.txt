It's worth those nights where I'm scared to walk to my basement
These four walls feel like they're caving in
There's pictures of you and me hidden behind my couch
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine through my window well
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep

And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
I used to have an escape
But I ripped the map up a long time ago

So I'll lie to myself and say that I don't care at all
You'll always be hidden in the basement of everything that I love
Am I trying to forget you or just cover you up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
The only time that I feel fine
Is when I'm parked in front of my house with tears in my eyes
I find comfort in weakness because it's always there for me
You'll always be hidden in the basement
Of everything that I love

Are you trying to forget me or did you cover me up?
I only miss you late at night when I can't sleep
And get way too honest, I've lost you, so I've got nothing to lose
