Fading old ports, send them off to cast
The hazy water will never pull them back
You found the pieces washed up in the bay
You said you saw a colored light through the grey

Turn the station, there's something crawling in
The hounds are restless, you can hear them sing
The water rises, trembling as it breathes
You said you felt a quick shift in the breeze

In the night they'll find you all alone
With the color red surrounding your throat
They were in their bedrooms, eyes were closed
When the siren sounded, they woke
In the night they'll find you all alone
With the color red surrounding your throat
