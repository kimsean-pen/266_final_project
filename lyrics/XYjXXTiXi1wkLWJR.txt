Hey DJ
Love the way
I lose my inhibitions when you spin
And I don't care if people stare
I'd rather boogie than try to fit in

Turn it up, let 'em scrutinize (I know you're watching)
Way up, 'cause the night is mine (i know you're watching)
Turn it up, lemme scandalize (I know you're watching)
Yeah, up under flashing lights

(No--don't--be)
Don't be jealous of my boogie, don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not, but I always see you lookin'
Don't be jealous of my boogie, don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not, but I always see you lookin'

I can't stop now
Won't slow down
I gotta emulate the BPM
I hit the scene and they turn green
It can't be easy, I don't envy them

Turn it up, let 'em scrutinize (I know you're watching)
Way up, 'cause the night is mine (i know you're watching)
Turn it up, lemme scandalize (I know you're watching)
Yeah, up under flashing lights

(No--don't--be)
Don't be jealous of my boogie, don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not, but I always see you lookin'
Don't be jealous of my boogie, don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not, but I always see you lookin'
I know you're watching
I know you're watching
I know you're watching
I see you lookin'
I know you're watching (Don't be jealous of my boogie)
I know you're watching (Don't be jealous of my boogie)
I know you're watching (You can say that you are not)
I see you lookin' (But I always see you lookin')
(No, no, no)
Don't be jealous of my boogie, don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not, but I always see you lookin'
Don't be jealous of my boogie, don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not, but I always see you lookin'
(Don't be, don't be so jealous of my boogie)
Okay, alright, hahahaha...
