Every day these voices
Make me question myself
Should I be somebody else
My demons overwelcoming

Won't let the pressure
Take over me
Won't let the pressure
Take over me

Ready to make my own way
Or die trying

I'm gonna break through the chains
Ready to make my own way
Or die trying
Wipe the blood off my face
I keep my head in the game
Or die trying
I'm gonna put up a fight
Gonna risk my own life
Or die trying
I'm gonna break through the chains
Ready to make my own way
Or die trying

Every day's the same
I'm getting bored of this lie
Sick of getting by
My demons overwelcoming

Won't let the pressure
Take over me
Won't let the pressure
Take over me

I'm gonna break through the chains
Ready to make my own way
Or die trying
Wipe the blood off my face
I keep my head in the game
Or die trying
I'm gonna put up a fight
Gonna risk my own life
Or die trying
I'm gonna break through the chains
Ready to make my own way
Or die trying

I'm gonna break through the chains
Ready to make my own way
Or die trying
Wipe the blood off my face
I keep my head in the game
Or die trying
I'm gonna put up a fight
Gonna risk my own life
Or die trying
I'm gonna break through the chains
Ready to make my own way
Or die trying
