No more going to the dark side
With your flying saucer eyes
No more falling down a wormhole
That I have to pull you out

Wriggling, twiggling worm inside
Devours from the inside out
No more talk about the old days
It's time for something great

I want you to get out
And make it work

So many lies
So many lies
So many lies
So many lies

So feel the love come off of them
And take me in your arms
Peel all of your layers off
I want to eat your artichoke heart

No more leaky holes in your brain
And no more false starts
I wanna get out
And make it work

So many lies
So many lies
So many lies
So many lies

So feel the love come off of them
And take me in your arms

I wanna get out
And make it work

I want you to get out
And make it work

I'll be ok

So many lies
So many lies
So many lies
So feel the love come off of them
And take me in your arms
