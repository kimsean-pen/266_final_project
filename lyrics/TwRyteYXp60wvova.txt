Remember days of yesterday (and)
How it flew so fast
The two score and a year we had
I thought would always last

The summer days and west coast dreams
I wished would never end
A young boy and his father
Idol and best friend

I'll always remember
Those were the best of times
A lifetime together
I'll never forget

The morning shows on the radio
The Case of the Missing Dog
Lying on the pillows at the old 812
Watching Harold and Maude

The record shops, the stickball fields
My home away from home
When we weren't together
The hours on the phone

I'll always remember
Those were the best of times
I'll cherish them forever
The best of times

But then came the call
Our lives changed forever more
You can pray for a change but prepare for the end.
The fleeting winds of time

Flying through each day
All the things I should've done
But time just slipped away
Remember seize the day
Life goes by in the blink of an eye

With so much left to say
These were the best of times

I'll miss these days
Your spirit lit my life each day
Thank you for the inspiration

Thank you for the smiles
All the unconditional love
That carried me for miles
It carried me for miles
But most of all thank you for my life
These were the best of times
I'll miss these days
Your spirit lit my life each day
My heart is bleeding bad
But I'll be okay
Your spirit guides my life each day
