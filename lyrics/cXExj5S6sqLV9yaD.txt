This one is for the girls with the booming system
Top down, AC with the cooling system
When she come up in the club, she be blazin' up
Got stacks on deck like she savin' up

And she ill, she real, she might got a deal
She pop bottles and she got the right kind of bill
She cold, she dope, she might drink coke
She always in the air, but she never fly coach
She a motherfucking trip, trip, sailor of the ship, ship
When she make it drip, drip kiss her on the lip, lip
That's the kind of girl I was lookin' for
And yes you'll get slapped if you're lookin' hoe

I mean my, my, my, you're like pelican fly
I mean, you're so shy and I'm loving your smile
You're like slicker than the girl with the thing on his eye, oh

Beating like a drum and it's coming your way

This one is for the girls in the polos
Entrepreneur chicks in the nolos
She could ball with the crew, she could solo
But I think I like her better when she dolo
And I think I like her better with her dress on
She ain't even gotta try to put the mac on
She just gotta give me that look, when she give me that look
Then the panties comin' off, off, uh

Excuse me, you're a hell of a girl you know I really got a thing for American girls
I mean, sigh, sickenin' eyes I can tell that you're in touch with your feminine side
Yes I did, yes I did, somebody please tell her who the F I is
