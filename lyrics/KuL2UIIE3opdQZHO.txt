I need a long vacation
some place to clear my mind
well I'll tell you if something's wrong
sometimes it's hard to find
dreams for two, this place is like a zoo
I wanna go where nobody knows
the situation, since me, oh so fine
I'd love to learn to fly
I wanna leave this place behind
vacation, vacation, vacation
I wanna go where nobody knows
vacation, vacation, vacation
