It could be in Moscow
it could be in France
It could be somewhere
when I'm lost in a dance
I could win a horse
I could win a car
I would drive it to you
cause it isn't so far
I'm missing you
I could be somewhere
lost in the rain
I could have umbrellas
but it is all the same
Stagger on buildings and I hear you call
I hold myself tight
then I would not fall
I'm missing you
