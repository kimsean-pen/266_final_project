Head to toe I'm feeling cold
The sickness is sinking in
This altitude is something new
Wears off and I'm feeling blue
Cold sweats numb lips
I see you leaning on him
I can't stop this feeling I have made
Just one more bump and I'll be ok

(So won't you walk my way, So won't you walk my way)

I can't erase what I have done
But now you're the only one
I can't escape what I've become
So won't you walk my way, So won't you walk my way

I see you walking over
I'm in a haze haven't slept for days
Struggling to remember your name
Cold sweats numb lips
I see you leaning on him
I can't stop these memories I have made
Just one more bump and I'll be ok

(So won't you walk my way, So won't you walk my way)

I can't erase what I have done
But now you're the only one
I can't escape what I've become
So won't you walk my way, So won't you walk my way

Won't you walk my way, won't you walk away

I can't escape what I've become
So won't you walk my way, So won't you walk my way

I've fallen far from myself
Still waiting for the memories to erase
What I've become
What I've become
What I've become

I can't erase what I have done
But now you're the only one
I can't escape what I've become
So won't you walk my way, So won't you walk my way

I can't erase what I have done
But now you're the only one
I can't escape what I've become
So won't you walk my way, So won't you walk my way
