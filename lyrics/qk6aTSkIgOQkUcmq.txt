Normal Children's birth, some could be painful at times
As the newborn rise, slowly all the pain will die
While life grows inside, joy and fear dwells in my mind
Everything went fine, until I got some weird pain inside of me

Unable to eat, vomit endlessly
Strange anomalies
Something dwells inside, growing suddenly
Then I started to bleed
Unbearable flowing hemorrhage
Infected remains
Were draining out of me as I went insane

Inoculated life

Eviscerate
Blood all over,?
As they pull out
Embryonic waste
No human from
Yet to relate
For the mother
Now it's too late

Gory delivery
Innards will follow
As they pull out the fetus
Pungent smell rises
As the mother waits for surgery
Disgusting mutation
That science has never seen
None would be able to tell
What kind of life it could be

Normal Children's birth, some could be painful at times
As the newborn rise, slowly all the pain will die
While death grows inside, mortal life fades in my eyes
There's no way to hide from this inoculated life
