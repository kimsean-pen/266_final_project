If your memory serves you well
We were gonna meet again and wait
So I'm goin' to unpack all my things
And sit before it gets too late

No man alive will come to you
With another tale to tell
But you know that we shall meet again
If your memory serves you well

This wheel's on fire
Rolling down the road
Best notify my next of kin
This wheel shall explode

If your memory serves you well
I was gonna confiscate your lace
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot
And hide it in your case

If I knew for sure that it was yours
But it was oh so hard to tell
And you know that we shall meet again
If your memory serves you well

This wheel's on fire
Rolling down the road
Best notify my next of kin
This wheel shall explode

If your memory serves you well
You'll remember that you're the one
That called on me to call on them
To give you your favors done

And after every plan had failed
And there was nothing more to tell
You knew that we would meet again
If your memory served you well

This wheel's on fire
Rolling down the road
Best notify my next of kin
This wheel shall explode

If your memory serves you well
If your memory serves you well
