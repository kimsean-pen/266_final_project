I've been lookin' for a long shot
I've been aimin' high
Guess I've always known
I'd be lookin' on my own
For a second, I thought I found it tonight
You said I was a long shot
You were probably right
And I don't wanna leave
But I got places I wanna be
And this heavy love, I gotta leave behind
Oh, don't you think too much
No, there's nobody else and I'm still in love
But, oh, I got my mind made up
It's who I gotta choose
Between you—or a long shot
Or a long shot
There's champagne in the green room
It's been a hell of a ride
But is it still a toast if I'm drinkin' all alone
Here's to wishin' you were with me tonight
Oh, don't you think too much
No, there's nobody else and I'm still in love
But, oh, I got my mind made up
It's who I gotta choose
Between you—or a long shot
Or a long shot
Or a long shot
Or a long shot
Or a long shot
Are you awake
Is it too late to be callin' you up
'Cause I'm afraid
What I gained
Don't outweigh the love we lost
The love we lost
Oh, don't you think too much
If there's nobody else and you're still in love
Oh, lately I feel stuck
I had to call you up
I had to call you up
Oh, don't you think too much
No, there's nobody else and I'm still in love
But, oh, I got my mind made up
It's who I gotta choose
Between you—or a long shot
Or a long shot
Or a long shot
Or a long shot
