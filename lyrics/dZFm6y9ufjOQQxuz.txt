Breathe in
Sink in
I bet you couldn't sleep
I bet you couldn't see with the tunnel vision that you had

(Keeps on raining)
(Keeps on raining)

I bet you couldn't breathe
I bet you couldn't breathe when your lungs collapsed

(Keeps on raining)
(Keeps on raining)

I know you felt alone
I know you felt it in your bones
I could feel it in my teeth
I know you couldn't sleep
(If only you would find your mind)
Worried I can't remember where to begin
Misplaced my mind, presupposition
But you didn't know what you should've done
Maybe you shouldn't have had another high
Maybe I'm just desperate to think
you'd be fine after you lost your mother
I guess that I thought that you'd be alright
Are you alright?
I wish you the best
I wish you godspeed
I wish you the rest
And now you can sleep
They say that life goes on
Can't imagine how you missed her
But tell me where have you gone
Where was I when you called home
It's just not that easy when all that's left is just all your bones
