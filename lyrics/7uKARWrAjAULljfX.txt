Were you and he Lovers?
And would you say so if you were?
On a forecourt
On a Friday
Passing my way

Oh...
Were you and he Lovers?
And if you were, then say that you were!
On a groundsheet
Under canvas
With your tent-flap
open wide

A note upon his desk
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
-Oh!-
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"But on the desk is where I want you!"

So I ask (even though I know):
Were you and he Lovers?
