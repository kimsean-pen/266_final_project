The very first day of my life
Was the day that you let me go
It was a blessing in disguise
Now I see that I'm beautiful

Cause all we ever did was fight
We were so dysfunctional
Now I've forgotten all the times
And all the days I was lovin you

Just like a ghost from my past
He's come back to haunt me now
Sayin that you want me back
But that's impossible so

Love me, leave me
Cause I've already closed that door
Don't want to be
In the pain I felt before

If only I could be myself
Without your approval anymore
If you love me, leave me
If you love me, leave me alone

Now there used to be a time
That I would have taken you back again
But now I got you off my mind
And I'm totally independent

So you can save your little lies
Cause I know what's happenin'
You're missin' me but say goodbye now
To all the days I was lovin' you

Just like a ghost from my past
He's come back to haunt me now
Sayin that you want me back
But that's impossible so

Love me, leave me
Cause I've already closed that door
Don't want to be
In the pain I felt before

If I only could be myself
Without your approval anymore
If you love me, leave me
If you love me, leave me alone

If you really wanna help
Then you should go
Cause I promised myself
I'd let it alone

At the back of the shelf
Cause there I put what we had
I'm never goin back now

Love me, leave me
Cause I've already closed that door
Don't want to be
In the pain I felt before
If I only could be myself
Without your approval anymore
If you love me, leave me
If you love me, leave me alone
Love me, leave me
Cause I've already closed that door
Don't want to be
In the pain I felt before
If I only could be myself
Without your approval anymore
If you love me, leave me
If you love me, leave me alone
