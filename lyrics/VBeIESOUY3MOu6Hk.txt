Oh now you can see me
How in there rapture
Pretty and pasion, I fall... in your heart
Come on here, ...
I hit my halo, the song how sing now
They just should get it
They make up gatter place
Come try your heart come and fight
Out in the air, ...
Well you keep on night come and fight
And leave my footprints out in the sand
And all the kisses brought us to bed
When I was sleeping you shut my heart
I had no memory under the star
When I was sleeping you shut my heart
I had no memory under the star
Rich the ...there's nothing to stya
I fly tonight ...when you'll find me
...through the night can you find me?
