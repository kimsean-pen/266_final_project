Mr. Shiver I'm glad you sent a line
Euphoria's endearing
And it's cold we might as well retire
To the drawer where all used things resign
Where all used things resign

Mr. Shiver, in the river
You were sold, you were told
I do, I do
If we make it over the mountain
I do, I do
If we make it, if we make it

Dressed in leather, red ball and vault attire
The most ironic place to be is easy yeah
Between my finger and the blade
Right before I let the used resign

Mr. Shiver, in the river
You were sold, you were told
I do, I do
If we make it over the mountain
I do, I do
If we make it, if we make it

You might lose the one you choose
You might lose who won you
Time's ten, time's ten, time's ten, time's ten

You might lose the one you choose
You might lose who won you
Time's ten, time's ten, time's ten, time's
Times

I do, I do
If we make it over the mountain
I do, I do
If we make it, if we make it
