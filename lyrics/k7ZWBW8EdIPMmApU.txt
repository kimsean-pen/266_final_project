I realize it's all the same
People learn a lot in difficult ways
They're out there calling your name
There is not much left, time can rip away

Just how long must I wait?
Try to keep your control
But it's already gone away
'Cause in the year of thirteen moons
Things are way too hard to say
Either way

There's something outside this room
And I can get out but I can't with you
The stars are calling for you
I'm terrified that they'll take you too soon

Now you're so far away
Try to keep my control
But there's so much I can't say
It's been a year since I've seen you
And I'm just waiting for the moon
To change
