She takes the money out her mother's purse
Finds the place she'll go to first
She meets the man that she's never met
It's a face she won't forget

Gimme gimme gimme gimme
More he said
Won't rest til you're in my bed

Gimme gimme gimme gimme
More he said
Won't rest til you're in my bed

Hey girl you know it's not that fun
I saw you crying in the rising sun
Now I can see I'm not the only one
(I can see you're not the only one I saw you)
That saw you crying in the rising sun

You're feeling all your solar plexus freeze
As the sick pours down your knees
The screen is blurry on your telephone
He can see you're all alone he said

Gimme gimme gimme gimme
More he said
Won't rest til you're in my bed

Gimme gimme gimme gimme
More he said
Won't rest til you're in my bed

Hey girl you know it's not that fun
I saw you crying in the rising sun
Now I can see I'm not the only one
(I can see you're not the only one I saw you)
That saw you crying in the rising sun

Look who's laughing now
You said look who's laughing now
Look who's laughing now
You said look who's laughing
Look who's laughing

Gimme gimme gimme gimme
More he said
Won't rest til you're in my bed

Gimme gimme gimme gimme
More he said
Won't rest til you're in my bed

Hey girl you know it's not that fun
I saw you crying in the rising sun
Now I can see I'm not the only one
(I can see you're not the only one I saw you)
That saw you crying in the rising sun

I saw you crying
I saw you crying
I saw you crying
Crying
Crying
