I want to hold you to the sun
I want to be your faithful one
I want to show you all the beauty you don't even know you hold
I'm hurting you for your own good
I'd die for you, you know I would
I'd give up all my wealth to buy you back the soul you never sold

I want to mix our blood and put it in the ground
So you can never leave
I want to win your trust, your faith, your heart
You'll never be decieved

Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, Liar

I want you to heal you pretty sweet
(I want to heal you pretty sweet)
I'll throw rose petals at your feet
I'll spend eternity comparing all my poetry to yours
I want to see love through your eyes
(I'll throw rose petals at your feet)
You'll never have to compromise
I'd give up all my fame to bite your demons and your bloody woes

I want to mix our blood and put it in the ground
So you can never leave
I want to win your trust, your faith, your heart
You'll never be decieved

Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar
