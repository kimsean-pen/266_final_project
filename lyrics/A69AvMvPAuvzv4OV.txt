I was dancing when I was twelve
I was dancing when I was twelve
I was dancing when I was aaah
I was dancing when I was aaah
I danced myself right out the womb
I danced myself right out the womb
Is it strange to dance so soon
I danced myself right out the womb

I was dancing when I was eight
I was dancing when I was eight
Is it strange to dance so late
Is it strange to dance so late

I danced myself into the tomb
I danced myself into the tomb
Is it strange to dance so soon
I danced myself into the tomb

Is it wrong to understand
The fear that dwells inside a man
What's it like to be a loon
I liken it to a balloon

I danced myself out of the womb
I danced myself out of the womb
Is it strange to dance so soon
I danced myself into the tomb
But when again once more

I danced myself out of the womb
I danced myself out of the womb
Is it strange to dance so soon
I danced myself out of the womb
