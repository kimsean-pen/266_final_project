Walking through the cross fire heart
Feeling heavy and hopeless.
And wonderin' how I ever will see
Through this darkness.
Every drop of blood can be

So beautiful
And I sure was bleedin' the drops by
The bucketful.
I have the strength to endure

And all the love so pure
I have the strength to endure
Because... because...
I'm not afraid to tell her
Just how things work.
Ride a hurricane
Through the fast lane

Always looking over my shoulder
She said, "there's something about you
And neon lights always gow hot.
Baby we can see this through

Just give me all the strength
you've got".
I have the strength to endure
And all the love so pure
I have the strength to endure
Because... because...
I have the strenght to endure

And all the love so pure
I have the strenght to endure
Because... because...
I'm not afraid to tell her
Just how things work.
Ride a hurricane
Through the fast lane
Always looking over my shoulder
She said, "there's something about you
And neon lights always gow hot.
Baby we can see this through
Just give me all the strength
you've got".
I have the strength to endure
And all the love so pure
I have the strength to endure
Because... because...
I have the strenght to endure
And all the love so pure
I have the strenght to endure
Because... because...
