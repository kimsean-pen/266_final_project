Oh, this morning sure could've changed our past
Oh, please just make this moment last
Oh, this morning sure could change our past
If this feeling stays I will remember last night forever

I try to hold it inside
So why are you happening?
One moment two senses
All that I want is no more falling
No more
So why this change of heart?
We're losing our minds
'Cause conscious minds make mistakes
Stop wasting my time
Didn't think things could change this fast

Oh, this morning sure could change the past
Oh, please just make this moment last
Oh, this morning sure could change the past
If this feeling stays I will remember last night forever
