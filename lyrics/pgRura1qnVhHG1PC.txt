Pills got me wide awake
Ill be with you right away
Driving the wraith all day
Like it's my hide away
I been driving the getaway
Free smoke can't feel no day
Free smoke can't feel no day
Yahhh
Pills got me wide awake
Ill be with you right away
Driving the wraith all day
Like it's my hide away
I been driving the getaway
Free smoke can't feel no day
Free smoke can't feel no day
Yahhh

Boy you get filled with led
As long as I aim for the head
Fauni shoot nothing but net
Fish net around her legs
She gone spread out my jeans with the head
You used to ride in the back of my pack
Now she passenger side of my benz
Yahhh
Gettin' throat hittin' a 100
Bust in her mouth do a donut
Can't breathe from the gas?
Im light years away but its normal
So zooted im tryna act normal
Walk in this bitch without warning
Yah
Walk in this bitch without warning
Yahhh

Pills got me wide awake
Ill be with you right away
Driving the wraith all day
Like it's my hideaway
I been driving the getaway
Free smoke can't feel no day
Free smoke can't feel no day
Yahhh
Pills got me wide awake
Ill be with you right away
Driving the wraith all day
Like it's my hideaway
I been driving the getaway
Free smoke can't feel no day
Free smoke can't feel no day
Yahhh
