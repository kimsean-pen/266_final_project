Descent...
Descent...

Falling victim from neglect
Designed thoughts and intellect
Forgotten and displaced
The crux of my dismay

I feel nothing
I am nothing
I feel nothing
Nothing

How deep I descend?
Until I reach my end?
How deep I descend?

How deep I descend?
Until I reach my end?
How deep I descend?

Deeper into this abyss
Weighted down and sinking fast
Life did not offer me
More than false destiny

I feel nothing
I am nothing
I feel nothing
Nothing

How deep I descend?
Until I reach my end?
How deep I descend?

How deep I descend?
Until I reach my end?
How deep I descend?

I am nothing
I feel nothing
I am nothing
I feel nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing...

How deep I descend?
Until I reach my end?
How deep I descend?

How deep I descend?
Until I reach my end?
How deep I descend?

How deep I descend?
How deep I descend?
How deep I descend?
How deep I descend?
