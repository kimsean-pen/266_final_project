Hoo, hoo, baby
Alright
Yeah,

In a world when dreams are few
You've got me baby, I've got you
You're the one that makes
Me feel brand new

Sometimes love can wear you out
Chill your soul baby, make you doubt
That you'll never find
The one that's true

All of my life I've longed for this
Someone who makes me happy
Let's seal this moment with a kiss
I wanna know and nothin's gonna stop me
'Cause I've been to the bottom, now I'm back on top
When I'm feelin' the rhythm as we start to rock
When ya get down to it
I belong to you

Hey baby

Though I'm not afraid to let it show
I'll tell the world, I want everyone to know
There's nobody does
Me like you do, boy
(Like you do, like you do)

All of my love is yours tonight
I live to make you happy
Nothin' has ever felt so right
I want it all and nothin's gonna stop me '

'Cause I've been to the bottom, now I'm back on top
When I'm feelin' the rhythm as we start to rock
When ya get down to it
Boy, you know, I belong to you

When you touch me tender and you reach my soul
When I start to weaken and I lose control
When you get down to it
I belong to you
To you

Say that you love me boy and I'll make it right
Oh yeah
I'll rock your heart and soul till the morning light
Boy no
I will, oh yeah, yeah

You know I belong to you
And you belong to me

All of my love is yours tonight
I live to make you happy
Nothin' has ever felt so right
I want it all and nothin's gonna stop me
'Cause I've been to the bottom, now I'm back on top
When I'm feelin' the rhythm as we start to rock
When ya get down to it
I belong to you
I belong to you

When you touch me tender and you reach my soul
When I start to weaken and I lose control
When you get down to it
I belong to you

I belong to you, baby
You belong to me
I belong to you
You belong to me
I belong to you
You belong to me

When ya get down to it
I belong to you

I belong to you, baby
You belong to me
I belong to you
You belong to me
I belong to you
You belong to me, yeah
