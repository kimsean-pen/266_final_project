Last night when we were young
Love was a star
A song unsung

Life was so new
So real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star
That shone so bright
Ages ago last night

To think that spring had depended
On merely this a look, a kiss

To think that something so splended
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now let's reminisce and recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung
When we were young last night
