I was wrong
And I'm sorry for that
Things just haven't been the same
Since I got my mind back
And I try to hide the pain
But I'm never good at that
You can love me, you can hate me
I just want my soul back
And if there really is no God
Who the fuck is in my head?
Planting seeds of deceit
I guess this must be the end
They say the grass is always greener on the other side
But every time I try, I go colorblind

I've been having fucking trouble sleeping
Every thought, that's in my head
Is telling me to lose my grip and just end it
No God to pray to, I have nothing left
I thought this life was something more than itself
I'm going crazy, can't trust myself
So please just let me go, and try to find hope
If I lose myself I know that I'll always be alone
(Fuck)
