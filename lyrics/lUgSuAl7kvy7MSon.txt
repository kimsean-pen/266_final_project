The right stuff
The right stuff
First time was a great time
Second time was a blast
Third time I fell in love
Now I hope it lasts
I can see it in your walk
Tell it when you talk
See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts

You've got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on
You've got the right stuff, baby
You're the reason why I sing this song
All that I needed was you
Oh girl, you're so right
And all that I wanted was you
You made all...

My dreams come true
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
The right stuff
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
The right stuff

First kiss was sweet kiss
Second kiss had a twist
Your third and your fourth kiss
I don't wanna miss
I can see it in your walk
Tell it when you talk
See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts

You've got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on
You've got the right stuff, baby
You're the reason why I sing this song
All that I needed was you
In my life, you're so right
And all that I wanted was you
You made all...

Every one of my dreams come true

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
The right stuff

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
The right stuff
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
The right stuff
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
The right stuff
Girl... yeah baby
You know you've got the right stuff
And girl... yeah baby
You know you, you know you've got it girl
In my life, you're so right
You made all
You know what you did
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
The right stuff
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
The right stuff
You've got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on
You've got the right stuff, baby
