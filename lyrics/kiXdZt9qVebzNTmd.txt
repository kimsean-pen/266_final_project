I don't want no dead end job
I don't wanna be no number
I don't want no dead end job
I don't wanna be no number

The queue gets longer everyday
I just ain't no time to stay
I ain't gonna run away
All I want to do is play

Don't wanna be no teacher
I don't wanna be no slave
I don't wanna work no assembly line
A' like my uncle Dave

The queue gets longer everyday
I just ain't got time to stay
I ain't gonna run away
All I wanna do is play

I don't want no dead end job
I don't want no dead end job
I don't want no dead end job
I don't want no dead end job

I don't want no dead end job
I don't wanna be no number
I don't want no dead end job
I don't wanna be no number

The queue gets longer everyday
All I wanna do is play
I just ain't got time to stay
But I ain't gonna run away

Don't wanna be no millionaire
Don't wanna own no mint
I don't wanna be no tax exile
And I don't mind being skint
