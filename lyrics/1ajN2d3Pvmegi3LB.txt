Will we, will we live like this
Forever
Because this feeling came over me
And sticks to you
Sticks to me
Forever

And they want it much more
They want it much more
This feeling ain't crappted
Rather than floor
It sticks to you
It sticks to me

Will we, will we live like this
Forever
Because this feeling came over me
And sticks to you
Sticks to me
Forever and ever
and ever
and ever
and ever

And you want them to leave
Pretendin to go
But nothing else to changin
Since your life in your bones
It sticks to you
It sticks to me

Will we, will we live like this
Forever
Will we, will we live like this
Together

Tonight is the night
We fall
Tonight
You and I
Is the night
We fall
You and I
Is the night
We fall
we fall
We fall
we fall
