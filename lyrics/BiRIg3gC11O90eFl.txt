Here tomorrow, gone today
Here tomorrow, gone today
Here tomorrow, gone today
Here tomorrow, gone today

You got what you wanted, the world on a string
Found your Madonna and lost everything
We all had your back and watched you run away
Always here tomorrow and gone today
Always here tomorrow and gone today

You're all talk and nothing to say
We don't want, don't want what you're givin' away
Know how to move and you know how to shake
We don't want, don't want what you're givin' away

Here tomorrow, gone today
Here tomorrow, gone today

A walking disaster soakin' space
Just a matter of time before you show your second face
A maniacal master of getting your way
Always here tomorrow and gone today

You're all talk and nothing to say
We don't want, don't want what you're givin' away
Know how to move and you know how to shake
We don't want, don't want what you're givin' away

Got style but you got no game
We don't want, don't want what you're givin' away
You're always lookin' for somebody to play
We don't want, don't want what you're givin' away

Here tomorrow, gone today
Here tomorrow, gone today
Here tomorrow, gone today
Here tomorrow, gone today

You're all talk and nothing to say
We don't want, don't want what you're givin' away
Know how to move and you know how to shake
We don't want, don't want what you're givin' away

You've got style, but you got no game
We don't want, don't want what you're givin' away
You're always lookin' for somebody to play
We don't want, don't want what you're givin' away

Here tomorrow, gone today
Here tomorrow, gone today
Here tomorrow, gone today
Here tomorrow, gone today
Here tomorrow, gone today
