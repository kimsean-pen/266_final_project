you
you'd fall in love with anyone

I'd think you'd fall in love with anyone
who fell in love with you
and they frequently do
so take comfort
cruel comfort
before you start to wonder
how you got locked inside your room
and how long will it...
take?
before you start to hate yourself
and go straight
to the arms of someone else
and I'll just
wait
'till those arms belong to me and I'm not
saying that you love me
I'm not saying any...
thing
tell me
Do you let them down, gently?
Does is only make it harder?
to let the feeling linger
to drag it out a little longer
Does it put your mind at ease?
but you're the one who brought 'em here
you're the one who has to take them when you leave
and how long will it...
take?
before you start to hate yourself
and go
straight to the arms of someone else
and I'll just
wait
'till those arms belong to me
and I'm not saying that you love me
I'm not saying any...
thing
and how long will it...
take?
before you start to hate yourself
and go...
straight to the arms of someone else
and I'll just...
wait
'till those arms belong to me
and I'm not
saying that you love me
I'm not saying any...
