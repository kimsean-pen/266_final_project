With the error that's in my mind
And in my soul

I'm driving blind

I got a picture in the box
That is bringing me to where I am

Yet the eyes are all affixed on you not me

For driving blind

And the first time will be the last time
That you believe

You're falling as you decide
Face down the whole world wide
Before cannot be retrieved

From all the way up here there's no end
I'm flying high
But the worst is never first
And there's a person that'll set you straight

Cancelling the force within my brain
For flying high
The simulator has been disengaged

Indifference begins to take sides
Face down the whole world wide
Before cannot be retrieved

From all the way up here there's no end
I'm flying high
But the worst is never first
And there's a person that'll set you straight
