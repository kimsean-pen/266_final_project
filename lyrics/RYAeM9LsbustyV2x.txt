There's something sick inside these walls
Your loss of mind has come and called
Your disillusioned view of why
You'll find no dignity upon the day you die

When you die, oh yeah
In the end we find what's true
Suffering overdue

You claimed this oath and then you swore
Beyond today, beyond forever more
Withdrawn inside these sickened walls
Silence is broken, you can break me no more

Yeah, no more, oh yeah
In the end we find what's true
Suffering overdue

Oh yeah, all right
In the end we find what's true
Suffering overdue

I tried to speak my mind but it fell on deaf ears
These scars I've held within for so many years
So many years
So many years

So many years
So many years
So many years
So many years, yeah!

Oh yeah, all right
In the end we find what's true
Suffering overdue

Oh yeah, all right
In the end we find what's true
Suffering overdue
