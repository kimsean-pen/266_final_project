It's funny how I can give the best advice
But I can't follow
So I tell myself, so I tell myself
It's funny how I can push the pills but
But I can't swallow
So I tell myself, so I tell myself

Run, run away

Blame is a coward but self righteous
A funny little creature hiding out in me
Hate is power with a price tag
A funny little creature screaming out in me

(It's funny how the little)
It's funny how the stories that I tell myself
Leave so many things out
Do I believe myself, or someone else?
It's funny how I know what's wrong
About everything and everyone else
When I don't know myself
When I don't know myself

Run, run away

Blame is a coward but self righteous
A funny little creature hiding out in me
Hate is power with a price tag
A funny little creature screaming out in me

(It's in me)

Fear is a liar
Pleads right before
If you fight your shadow
You get lost in the war
Ambitions are cheap
Preach up to the whore
Drunk or simple
We always want more
I always want more
I always want more

Lust is beauty in a bodybag
A funny little bitch that's screaming: Just use me

Blame is a coward but self righteous
A funny little creature hiding out in me
Oh, let me go
Oh, let me go
It's screaming out in me
It's gonna get worse, before it gets better
It's gonna get worse, before it gets better
Goddamn it
Trust me
