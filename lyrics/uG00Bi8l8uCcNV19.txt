There was a time I was down, down
I didn't know what to do
I was just stumblin' around, around
Thinkin' things could not improve
I couldn't look on the bright side
Of anything at all
That's when you gave me a call

And I feel better, better
Better than before
I feel better, better
Now I'm not down anymore

And there were times I was sure, so sure
I couldn't turn it around
I couldn't care anymore
About the good things I found
That's when you gave me a reason
To make me smile again
I only have to see you and then

I feel better, better
Better than before
I feel better, better
Now I'm not down anymore
I feel better, better
Better than before
I feel better, better
Now I'm not down anymore

Life sometimes seems to get the best of you
Like everything just brings you down
Just when you think there's nothing you can do
A friendly face will bring you around
And you'll feel better

You'll feel better, you'll feel better
Better than before
You'll feel better, much better
No, you won't be down anymore
