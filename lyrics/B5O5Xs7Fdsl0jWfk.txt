Never perform a dead defying act
And I won't fall
I'm brave
I can save the very small
I'm everything
but I'm nothing at all

You can be my light to the sky
why do you try to make me better than the divine
Isn't a shame don't giving a name
let me remain
let me remain

I'm everything that I'll ever be
I'm everything that I've ever seen
I'm everything that slowly falls
I'm everything but I am nothing at all

Even perform a dead defying miracle
for someone with the chemicals to believe
I'm brave but I 've bravely understated
I can save you from what you've taken
and leave

You compare our love to sun
what have you done
is the limit to the prices we've won
Isn't it same don't give it a name
let me remain
let me remain

I'm everything that I'll ever be
I'm everything that I've ever seen
I'm everything that slowly falls
I'm everything but I am nothing at all
I am nothing at all

I will perform a dead defying magic show
for those of you who wanna go some place else
I'm brave but I can't save you
from the things you won't change for yourself

You can be my light to the moon
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
Isn't a same don't give it a name
let me remain
let me remain

I'm everything that I'll ever be
I'm everything that I've ever seen
I'm everything that slowly falls
I'm everything but I am nothing at all
I am nothing at all
