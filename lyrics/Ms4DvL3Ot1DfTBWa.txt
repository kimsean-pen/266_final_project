Why can't you give her room?
Respect her spatial needs
I feel you compress her
Into a small space

With clairvoyance
She knew what you needed
And she gave it to you
With clairvoyance
She knew what you needed
And she gave it to you
Now her desires are repressed
Arrows in the flesh

When she found your love
Her nature bowed her head
She surrendered
She renounced the world for you
(She renounced the world for you)
Now she's poisoned by demands
You cannot answer

Why this sacrifice?

With clairvoyance
She knew what you needed
And she gave it to you
With clairvoyance
She knew what you needed
And she gave it to you

Now she regrets the whole thing
A delayed reaction
When she left her craft voluntarily
For your nest for your love
Did you understand?

Appreciate

With clairvoyance
She knew what you needed
And she gave it to you
With clairvoyance
She knew what you needed
And she gave it to you
