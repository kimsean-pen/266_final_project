Hard to ignore them
Made too poor
Hate for the low kids
Strung outdoors

Four eyes

Perfect love
Perfect

Hard to ignore them
Loud and sure
Reaching the low kids
A hybrid war

Four eyes

Perfect love
Perfect

Dark words
Stark love
Now everyone is part of war
Tell me more, Gerasimov

Perfect sounding love
