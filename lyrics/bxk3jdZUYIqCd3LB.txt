I haven't seen you in a long time
Are you still sitting at the booth at the Brooklyn Bowl
With your long red coat and the tears welling in your eyes?
I haven't seen you in a long time
Are you still 27 and mad at me
Watching "Breathless" on DVD
In the dead of winter 2009?

Why did I crumble?
Why did I crumble?
Why did I crumble at the thought of you last night?

You haven't seen me in a long time
But I'm still 23 and worrying everyone I love is just pretending
You haven't seen me in a long time
But I still walk along the beach at night
I'm absolutely terrified I can't make it on my own

Why did I crumble?
Why did I crumble?
Why did I crumble at the thought of you last night?
We could never get it right

Am I unhappy because I'm not free
Or not free because I'm unhappy?
I wanted to see you to see if I still wanted to see you
But that's not fair

Why did I crumble?
Why did I crumble?
Why did I crumble at the thought of you last night?
We could never get it right
We could never get it right

I wanted to see you to see if I still wanted to see you
I wanted to see you to see if I still wanted to see you
