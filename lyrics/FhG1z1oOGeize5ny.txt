Laudate omnes gentes laudate
Magnificat en secula
Et anima mea laudate
Magnificat en secula

Happy nation
Living in a happy nation
Where the people understand
And dream of perfect man

Situation being to sweet salvation
For the people
For the good
For mankind brotherhood

We're traveling in time

Ideas by man
And only that will last
And over time
We've learned from the past

That no man fit
To rule the world alone
A man will die
But not his ideas

Happy nation
Living in a happy nation
Where the people understand
And dream of perfect man

Situation being to sweet salvation
For the people
For the good
For mankind brotherhood

We're traveling in time
Traveling in time

Tell them we've gone too far
Tell them we've gone too far

Happy Nation
Come through and I will dance with you
Happy Nation
Tell them we've gone too far

Happy Nation
Come through and I will dance with you
Happy Nation
Tell them we've gone too far

Come through and I will dance with you

Happy nation
Living in a happy nation
Where the people understand
And dream of perfect man

Situation being to sweet salvation
For the people
For the good
For mankind brotherhood

Happy Nation
Happy Nation
Happy Nation
Happy Nation
