They hang in their thousands
Suspended in paroxysm
In grotesque shapes and unnatural angles
Crying and laughing and they thrash as if drowning
Until agony rears through their bones and they crack
Strung out across this canopy
Ecstasy rolls eyes back
This black sanguine puppetry
Do my eyes deceive?

Mouths held wide by the chains
Drawn orgiastic and aghast
Become windows to self annihilation
The infinite veins of this howling tapestry
Its terrible shrieking choir

Rattles and coughs
Rasps and shakes
A thousand husks keening
Behold our congregation

Pray before the Altar of Needles
Worship in the Temple of Smoke

You will choke

All paths lead to the Garden
It is mapped in the fractures in the mirror

Pray before the Altar of Needles
Worship in the Temple of Smoke
Whine at the feet of Surrender
Smile all the while as you choke
Because we are in love with the pain
That we keep coming back to
Again and again and again
