Woh oh
Woke up this morning
Closed in on all sides
Nothing doing
I feel resistance
As I open my eyes
Someone's fooling
I've found a way to break
Through this cellophane line
Cause I know what's going on

In my own mind
Am I living in a box
Am I living in a cardboard box
Am I living in a box

Am I living in a cardboard box

Am I living in a box
Life goes in circles
Around and around circulating
I sometimes wonder
What's moving underground

I'm escaping
I've found a way to break

Through this cellophane line
Cause I know what's going on
In my own mind
Am I living in a box (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box
Am I living in a box (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box

Am I living in a box
(living)
(living)

(living)
I've found a way to break
Through this cellophane line
Cause I know what's going on
In my own mind
Am I living in a box (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box
Am I living in a box (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box
Am I living in a box (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box
Am I living in a box (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box
Am I living in a box (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box
Am I living in a box (living)
Am I living in a cardboard box
Am I living am I living am I living
Am I living am I living am I living
(In a box)
Am I living am I living
Am I living in cardboard box
Am I living in a box
Am I living am I living
Am I living in a cardboard box
Am I living in a box
