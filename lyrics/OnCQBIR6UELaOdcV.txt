Water inside, we're all in water
Water we climb and run through it
Water inside, we're all in water
Reaching inside of a big death bag

When you go to danger, ends are met and live
Where they are happens to be where they have been
When you lower placement, the strong get stronger
Where you are and when you waste there's a whip hitting you

Water inside, we're all in water
Water we climb and run through it
Water inside, we're all in water
Reaching inside of a big death bag

Every time I fake it devils crawl through me
I'm ashamed when I ignore the voices that agree
Get us all together all work for the same thing
It's only lie to recall believing your body

Water inside, we're all in water
Water we climb and run through it
Water inside, we're all in water
Reaching inside of a big death bag

Reach inside of a bag
Reach inside of a bag
