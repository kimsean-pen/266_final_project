Fire wins out over my self doubt
Her blue sea was seeking me
Broken dreams were breaking me
Swam into the deep blue sea
Days were heavy with despair
Broken dreams were breaking me
Cherubs pushed for more and more
Painted hearts on my front door
Burnt my file and I was free
Swam into the deep blue sea
Never went back home again
Yesterday it fades away
Fire wins out over my self doubt
Her blue sea was seeking me
Fire wins out over my self doubt
Still I've never ever known love
