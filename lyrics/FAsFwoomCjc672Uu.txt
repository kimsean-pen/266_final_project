You're always tellin' me to go out more
Go ahead, get out and see the world
But then I think, why should I
I'd rather stay home and cry

I never thought that I could be the other
The other way like the other ones
Let me open wide, let you see inside
And then you might agree

Would you say they find me unstable
'Cause they see me act a little bit different
But I know my way to greener pastures and
Think about it, won't you think it over
Please

Without you I can move
I can stretch my arms out, I can feel it
And when I'm in my room alone I feel good
Because I don't have to deal with you or the outside world

Would you say they find me unstable
'Cause they see me act a little bit different
But I know my way to greener pastures and
Think about it, won't you think it over
Please

I guess I'll get over it
Ooh - I guess I'll get over it
I guess I'll get over it
I guess I'll get over it

Would you say they find me unstable
'Cause they see me act a little bit different
But I know my way through greener pastures
Would you say they find me unstable
'Cause they see me act a little bit different
But I know my way through greener pastures
Would you say they find me unstable
Cause they see me act a little bit different
But I know my way through greener pastures
Greener pastures
See me act a little bit different
But I know my way through greener pastures
