I feel just like an open book,
Exposing myself in this neighborhood
Talking to people as if I'd knew them well
Thinking that everyone has come through different kinds of well
Lately I found myself in doubt,
Ask myself what it's all about
What am I doing here? What's this leading to?
What's the point of all? I found you!
I've got promises to keep like a cannon would land upon my feet,
Each time I fall

Every now and then in dreams by the river with no trees
Leaves are yellow, red and brown, and I hear
You whisper in my ear
Your love belong to everyone
I feel just like an open book,
A couple of words, it's all it took
In front of the bright white covers, still vacantly
Against my will, a drifting vessel in the storm
Pushed around, from shore to shore
I know there's so much left to see
I know I have so much left to give
But the memories remain, yet the scars don't feel the same
