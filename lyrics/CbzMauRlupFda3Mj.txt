I see you in the park
I see you doing well
Playing with your children
Everything is swell

Standing there, standing there
Standing there, standing there
Standing there, standing there
Standing there, standing there

I see you in you car
Trudding into school
Everything is great
Everything is cool

Standing there, standing there
Standing there, standing there
Standing there, standing there
Standing there, standing there

I'm hiding in the shadows
And I see you standing there
I'm hiding in the darkness
And I see you standing there
When I see you standing there
And I see you standing there

I see you in the park
I see you doing well
Playing with your children
Everything is swell

Standing there, standing there
Standing there, standing there
Standing there, standing there
Standing there, standing there

I see you in the car
Trudding into school
Everything is great
Everything is cool

Standing there, standing there
Standing there, standing there
Standing there, standing there
Standing there, standing there

I'm hiding in the shadows
And I see you standing there
I'm hiding in the darkness
And I see you standing there
And I see you standing there
And I see you standing there

Standing there
Standing there
I'm standing there
Standing there

Go!
Don't look!
