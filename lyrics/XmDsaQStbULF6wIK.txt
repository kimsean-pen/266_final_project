Time tried to stop one
Cold cold night in June
Somehow I knew you
Kept on dancing through

And you jumped on a flight in the
Darkest of blues, took a trip to paradise
Through the stars and back over moon
Oh, tell me it's true, oh

Please just tell you're alright
Are you way up in the sky
Laughing, smiling, looking down
Saying "one day we'll meet in the clouds"
Up in the clouds

No one I knew stood
Half as bright as you
But now you shine on
The perfect avenue

And the light that you left it helps me to see
A way through all the bitterness
A way to who I really want to be
Oh, lights up the streets, oh

Please just tell you're alright
Are you way up in the sky
Laughing, smiling, looking down
Saying "one day we'll meet in the clouds"
Up in the clouds

Some nights I still hear your whispers
And your memories they hang like a picture
Oh, you'll always be just like a sister

Some nights I still see your smile
Your number I wish i could dial
Oh, but I can't wait to talk for a while, oh

Please just tell you're alright
Are you way up in the sky
Laughing, smiling, looking down
I know one day we'll meet in the clouds
Up in the clouds
