I'll take you on a drive,
Like gardens filled with mirrors,
Lay back eyes open wide,
Through allies we're disappearing,

Come close, stay far,
I'll be your tiny raindrop
I'll fall down now
You left me feeling shameful.

Even if I could I would never let you know,
So come with me I'll buy you a raincoat
Stay with me I'm sick of the shameful,
Head up, I am lost and it's tangled
I need you on like garments.

Come at me horrid eyes
That seep into my system,
Push all intent on fire
The things we think we're missing,

'Cause it's all fine: a pillow and a blanket
Take your precious time, staring at the ceiling.

Even if I could I would never let you go,
So come with me I'll buy you a raincoat
Stay with me I'm sick of the shameful,
Head up, I am lost and it's tangled
I need you on like garments.

So come with me I'll buy you a raincoat
Stay with me I'm sick of the shameful,
Head up, I am lost and it's tangled
I need you on like garments.
