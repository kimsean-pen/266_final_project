I fell asleep last night to the heartbeats in my head,
I fell apart when I got home inside my bed.

I can't think, can't speak.
I can't move, can't breathe.
This is a white heart heat when you get next to me,
When I'm around you it's like waking up the dead.

My back's against the wall
Oh oh,
And I'm feelin' the pressure,
Yes I'm about to fall.
Oh oh,
What I'm feelin', It's torture.

It's unavoidable,
You are a magnet.
It's unavoidable,
I am metallic.

So do what you do
Do what you do
To me
It's unavoidable
You are a magnet
Unavoidable
I am metallic
Pull me in.

It never makes much sense to me,
But that's okay
It's like my love hate relationship with LA.

It feels so right, we kiss so high.
But the feelings come and go on every night.
Yeah it won't ever take much to make me stay.
My back's against the wall.

Oh oh
And I feel it, the pressure.
I'm about to fall.
Oh oh
And I feel it, it's torture.

It's unavoidable,
You are a magnet.
It's unavoidable,
I am metallic.

So do what you do,
Do what you do to me.

It's unavoidable,
You are a magnet.
It's unavoidable,
I am metallic.

Pull me in

We couldn't be more polar opposites
But what you do to me is magnet

And I'm about to fall

It's unavoidable,
You are a magnet.
It's unavoidable,
I am metallic.

So do what you do, do what you do to me

It's unavoidable,
You are a magnet.
It's unavoidable,
I am metallic.

Pull me in,
Pull me in,
Pull me in,
Pull me in.
