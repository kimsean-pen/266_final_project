Her voice is echoed in my mind
I count the days till she is mine
Can't tell my friends 'cause they will laugh
I love a girl from senior class

I daydream through freshman math
She fills out her college apps
I'll show her a world where we belong
But she'll have to drive us to the prom

That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
You can call me crazy
She is so amazing

That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
Girlfriends I've had plenty
But she's the one that I need

That's what I go to school for
That's what I go to school for

Her boyfriend's just turning nineteen
But that doesn't bother me
He's back at college, out of town
I find a reason to go 'round

I climb a tree outside her home
To make sure that she is alone
She looks up and sees me there
Still I can't help but stop and stare

That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
You can call me crazy
She is so amazing

That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
Girlfriends I've had plenty
But she's the one that I need

That's what I go to school for
That's what I, what I, what I go to school for

Everyone that you see all day knows
You're looking at me in a different way
I guess that's why my marks are getting so high
I can see those tell tale signs

Telling me that I was on your mind
I could see that you want it more when you told me
That I'm what you go to school for
I'm what you go to school for

She's made her choice and I'm the one
At least 'til Graduation comes
We drive past school to wave goodbye
My friends they can't believe their eyes

That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
You can call me crazy
She is so amazing

That's what I go to school for
Even though it is a real bore
Girlfriends I've had plenty
But she's the one that I need

That's what I go to school for
That's what I, what I, what I go to school for
