Dust my feathers
I'm shaking on the floor, but I want to fly
Hoping that it will get better, yeah
The television teases paradise

Get up, get up, get up, feather

Words taste bitter
Frozen every time I see a pair of eyes
Momma can I sleep forever?
Wake me when the birds light up the sky

Get up, get up, get up, feather
Be free

Now I'm flying and everything feels so free
Take me higher, take me
Now I'm flying, and with these broken wings, take me higher
Be free

Dust my feathers
I'm praying on my knees, cause I want to fly
Daddy can you change the weather?
Show me when the raindrops turn to life

Get up, get up, get up, feather
Be free

Now I'm flying and everything feels so free
Take me higher, take me
Now I'm flying, and with these broken wings, take me higher
Be free

Take me higher

Now I'm flying and everything feels so free
Take me higher, take me
Now I'm flying, and with these broken wings, take me higher
Be free

Now I'm flying and everything feels so free
Take me higher, take me
Now I'm flying, and with these broken wings, take me higher
Be free
