Weeks on and I'm on the road
Start to lose my sense of home
I should've called so many times
But I
I just sat next to my phone
Just know it takes it from me
To end this, darling
Oh
And I know you'll find
Someone who
Gives you the time
I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry but I have to go
Woah
It may be I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry but I have to go
Woah Woah
Woah Woah
Thinking back to every night
We just layed there for a while
And when I looked into your eyes
Woah
I never thought
I'd take it back
Just know it takes it from me
To end this, Darling
Ohh
And I know you'll find
Someone who
Gives you the time
I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry but I have to go
Woah
It may be I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry but I have to go
Just needed time to
Find my own
But I promise someone
Will give you all you want
And give you all you need
And you just got to see
I never meant to hurt you
No
Woah
I know you'll find
Someone who
Gives you the time
I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry but I have to go
Woah
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm sorry but I have to go
