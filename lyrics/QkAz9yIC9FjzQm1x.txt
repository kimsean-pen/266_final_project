Lonely float got in the way
Feel the fear, and do it anyway
Take a chance, no, it wasn't what you know
Take her hand, and don't let go

Oh, ooh, ooooh
And you can do it
Don't break
Yeah, you'll push through it
You're safe
Yes, you can do it
Don't break
Yeah, you'll push through it
You're safe

Tell her all of how you feel
Give her everything she needs to heal
Give your heart a second chance
And she will see that you're a good man

Oh, ooh, ooooh
And you can do it
Don't break
Yeah, you'll push through it
You're safe
Yes, you can do it

Don't break
Yeah, you'll push through it
You're safe
Yes, you can do it
Don't break
Yeah, you'll push through it
You're safe
