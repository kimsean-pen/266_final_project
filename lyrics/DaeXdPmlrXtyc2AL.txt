Baby you don't have to keep looking through my phone
If something's going on
Girl you'd already know
We can't even say two words without a fight anymore

How did we get here
Baby, I gotta know
On the other side of love
You tell me you hate me and I hate you more

On the other side of love
How did we get here
Baby, I gotta know
Hey baby girl, long givity
Is a thing wey you get with love
Trust and good livity
So listen' me
And just believe I make you stop fun
Gwaan like we are enemy
Cau' most definite
Without you inna me life my girl it would be desperate
Cau' me can forget
All the times when you had my back

Gyal you give me ministry
Hundred presents

So I represent and you represent
I am the president
You're my first lady
Gyal you ever scent

I'm the first baby
I told you girl
When you first met me
It's a crazy world

Nothin' come free
Baby you don't have to keep looking through my phone
If something is going on
Girl you'd already know
We can't even say two words without a fight anymore
How did we get here
Baby I gotta know (See dey)
On the other side of love

You tell me you hate me and I hate you more
On the other side of love

How did we get here
Baby I gotta know (Ring clock)

And we began to first live it up

I steered it up, I geared it up
We came to love we no feared enough
But now you ain't seein' it clear enough

And tell me you want me fi swearin' up

When you first met me

Nuttin' come free
Baby you don't have to keep looking through my phone
If something is going on
Girl you'd already know
We can't even say two words without a fight anymore
How did we get here
Baby I gotta know
On the other side of love
You tell me you hate me and I hate you more
On the other side of love
How did we get here (Ring clock)
