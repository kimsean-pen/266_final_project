Sun ray skies and we're lost
The hallway's upside down
You stumble over to me
And blow me away with a smile
Your finger's teasing my brain
"Forever ends today"
It's slow to get you to see
How you're teasing me tonight

No one's into you
No one's into me
But oh, they're into us and they can't see
Roulette in my brain
"Forever ends today"
Over and over they'll see
How your lips and my mouth should be
Dancing 'til we both fall backwards
Time and time again
Spinning 'round in my bed
I'll dream of you tonight

Oh, they're into you
Oh, they're into me
But no one's into us
They can't see
They can't see

Oh, they're into you
Oh, they're into me
But no one's into us
They can't see
They can't see

It's been weeks and weeks since I kissed you
Don't tell me
Don't tell me
Weeks and weeks it's been and I miss you
Don't tell me
Don't tell me it's over
