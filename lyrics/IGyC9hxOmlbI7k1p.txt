I crept inside your head
but I can't pretend I know a single thing
about what you've been feeling
A heavy burden to withhold, take my word a tortured soul's not a secret worth keeping
The sum of all fears closing in over these last few years
It pulls you under, so much deeper than I can venture
The past you knew overcome with black and blue
Become the light, see me through

So I'm writing songs, staying strong
Call me back it's been so long

Like a falling tide I recede to the void and belong
Until the better half of my indifference proves me wrong
Scars heal in time but I'm bleeding inside If I'm honest you haven't left me very hopeful but I hope you're wrong
And I promise agony won't be the only voice I carry on

So I'm writing songs, staying strong
Call me back it's been so long
Life just like you always said:
"If it can it will go wrong"

Writing songs, staying strong, off the ropes I'm already gone
Always falling could you call me back it's been so long
