(words & music: D. Snider)

Oh know, that girl, she's lookin' so fine
I know she knows, what she's doin' to my mind
Ooh, does she know that I'm wanting her so
Well, there's one thing I know, I can never let her go

CHORUS:

Talkin' 'bout hot love, you're making me crazy
Hot love, you're making me bad
Hot love, you're making me crazy
Think I'll go mad

So cool, no fool, she's headin' for me
Can't run, can't hide, she's in everything I see
Ooh, what will I say, should I pass, should I play
But my feet turn to clay 'cause she's blowin' me away

REPEAT CHORUS

Solo - Eddie

REPEAT CHORUS

Hot love, you're making me crazy
Hot love, you're making me bad
Hot love, you're making me crazy
Think I'll go mad (think I'll go mad)

Talkin' 'bout my hot love
Think I'll go mad, ooh
Talkin' 'bout my hot love, ooh
Think I'll go mad, yeah
