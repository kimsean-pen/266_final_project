Baby, dry your eyes, you can't afford another round
And your tears soup up the ground
Can you see the bar is closing you,
and though you're still about to drown
Hold your breath, we're going down

I wish I could turn the clock back, baby, let's just reset
And start it all over again
We used to coast through life so why don't we make the bet
Come on and make it easy

There's still a place for us
There's still a place for us
I'm gonna sober up
And make it right

There's still a chance for love
There's still a chance for love
I'm gonna sober up
And make it right

There will be a moment where there's nothing left to say
Spare your words, be sensible
Put a glass beneath our aching love and I'll get drunk on my regrets
'Cause I'm not invincible

I wish I could turn the clock back, baby, let's just reset
And start it all over again
We used to coast through life, so why don't we make the bet
Come on and make it easy

There's still a place for us
There's still a place for us
I'm gonna sober up
And make it right

There's still a chance for love
There's still a chance for love
I'm gonna sober up
And make it right

I'm gonna sober up
And make it right

We never bite hard enough into the dreams we once made
Now stay with me and I'll try to get us out of the shade
Come on and make it easy

There's still a place for us
There's still a place for us
I'm gonna sober up
And make it right

There's still a chance for love
There's still a chance for love
I'm gonna sober up
And make it right

There's still a place for us
There's still a place for us
I'm gonna sober up
And make it right

There's still a chance for love
There's still a chance for love
I'm gonna sober up
And make it right

I'm gonna sober up
And make it right

I'm gonna sober up
And make it right
