Well, we've got too much time on our hands,
so we've been looking at ourselves too much.
It's like if anybody meets your demands,
you get embarrassed and you start to blush.
When everyone's opinions are wasted,
it's getting too complicated!

What's this notion of a simple life?
Do you think that we're ever gonna get it right?
I don't understand how it is what we planned,
could ever go so wrong.
So I guess if we give it just a little time,
then we'll know if it's ever worth another try.
It's a line in the sand, it's a final stand!
so why'd it take so long?

I dare to say these problems are your problems,
please stop telling me you've got them.
Is it fair to say that we're not in this together,
when we're sorted into these columns?

I can't change the world, but would if I could,
It's not all about looking good.

Don't hold your breath,
gotta stay suppressed.
Doing our best 'til there's nothing left.
We're tired, but we're better when moving.
My dear, know there's nothing to fear.
Hold that smile from ear-to-ear,
in memory of the people we're losing.

I can't change the world, but would if I could,
It's not all about looking good.

What's this notion of a simple life?
Will we ever know what to do?
Don't think that we're ever gonna get it right,
if we listen to you!
If we listen to you!
