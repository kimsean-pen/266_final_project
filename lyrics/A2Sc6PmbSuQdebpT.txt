Yeah
Motherfuckers better know...
(I'm a bad, bad, bad-)
Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls
Huh, yeah

My man Inf left a tech and a nine at my crib
Turned himself in, he had to do a bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G
You with me?

Motherfuckin' right, my pocket's looking kind of tight
And I'm stressed, yo, Biggie, let me get the vest

No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat the tech is to his back
Word is bond, I'm a smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move

Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same four-five
Two point-blank, a motherfucker's sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing it's so hard

Yes, love, love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy
That's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whippin'
Webs on the neck from the necklace strippin'
Then I'm dippin' up the block and I'm robbin' bitches too
Up the herring bones and bamboos
I wouldn't give fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and a #1 mom pendant

I'm slamming niggas like shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
'Cause mom duke ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fuckin' angel dust
When I bust my gat, motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?

(When he's sticking you, I'm taking all your money)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot
(I'm a bad, bad, bad-)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot
(I'm a bad, bad, bad-)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot
(I'm a bad, bad, bad-)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot

Gimme the loot, gimme the loot
(I'm a bad, bad, bad-)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot
(I'm a bad, bad, bad-)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot
(I'm a bad, bad, bad-)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot

Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
And I'm shooting niggas quick if you hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up, in your back and head piece
The opposite of peace, sending mom duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Step in to your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
'Cause when I lick shots, the shits is persistent

Huh, goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug, 357 slug
And my nigga, Biggie got an itchy one grip

One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Motherfuckers better strip, yeah nigga, peel
Before you find out how blue steel feel

From the Beretta, puttin' all the holes in your sweater
The money getter, motherfuckers don't have better
Rolex watches, the colorful swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop it

Man, niggas, come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get stripped down for they earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her I'm taking her door knockers
And if she's resistant baka! baka! baka!

So go get your man, bitch, he can get robbed too

Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?

I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I said it, the cocksucker won't forget it

(When he's sticking you, I'm taking all your money)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot
(I'm a bad, bad, bad-)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot
(I'm a bad, bad, bad-)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot
(I'm a bad, bad, bad-)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot

Gimme the loot, gimme the loot
(I'm a bad, bad, bad-)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot
(I'm a bad, bad, bad-)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot
(I'm a bad, bad, bad-)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot

Man, listen, all this walkin' is hurtin' my feet
Ooh money looks sweet, (where at?) in the isuzu jeep
Man, I throw him in the beem, you grab the fucking c.r.e.a.m
And if he start to scream bam! bam!, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she thinks she a superstar
Ooh Biggie, let me jack her, I kick her in the back
Hit her with the gat
Yo, chill, shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked, gettin shot on the spot
Oh shit, the cops! Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts
So why the fuck he keep lookin? I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't tryin' to see central booking
Oh shit, now he lookin at my face
You better haul ass, 'cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, 'cause I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucker going out for the loot

(Take that motherfuckers)
