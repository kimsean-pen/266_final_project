The world turned innocent
Can you hear me?
(I confess I'm no redeemer)
Can you hear me?
What shall I do?

I witnessed everything
Faith won't leave me
Mind my tongue
It's like a fire
(Faith don't leave me)
Glow into words

This is the edge now
It's all we're living for
Rain on me
Love, you will rain on me

And at the end I
Boast in the cross and now
Love reigns the God incarnation
I've shaped

Out there is a world on fire

Accursed the hanged one
Divine love for free
What a fateful night
And a grateful life
The choir echoes
"Every man his price"

Price, love, love, love, love
Light my agony
And crucify me
Void the law
At the ninth hour
Void the law
At the ninth hour

This is the edge now
It's all we're living for
Rain on me
Love you will rain on me

And at the end I
Boast in the cross and now
Love reigns the God incarnation
I've shaped

The world turns flesh again
(No more fear in)
Mystified the final hours
(No more fear in)

Passover the brook
Time it is at hand
Obscure the facts
A passion play

This is the edge now
It's all we're living for
Rain on me
Love, you will rain on me

And at the end I
Boast in the cross and now
Love reigns the God incarnation
I've shaped

Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
(No more fear in)

Come take a look
The old symbols they move
Wounds still bleed
That's creed

Come take a look
The old symbols they move
Wounds still bleed
That's creed

Come take a look
The old symbols they move
(Can you see me?)
Come take a look
At the depth of my soul
