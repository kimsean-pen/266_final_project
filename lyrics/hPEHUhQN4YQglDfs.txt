I've escaped
Sundering the face of cadence
Impatient
to find the place where I was found

No longer skin to dull the pain
Adrenaline reclaiming aging sirens

I remember
Still I remember howls of youth
How pasture gleamed with pearls of dew
When everything was vibrant
When life would run with lawless legs to race the sun
Let's escape

I've escaped
Sundering with waves of violence
Defiant
Now I'm in place and I am found
No longer skin to dull the pain
Adrenaline reclaiming aging sirens

I remember
Still I remember howls of youth
How pasture gleamed with pearls of dew
When everything was vibrant
When life would run with lawless legs to race the sun
Let's escape

I remember
Still I remember howls of youth
How pasture gleamed with pearls of dew
