I can be an asshole of the grandest kind
I can withhold like it's going out of style
I can be the moodiest baby, and you've never met anyone
As negative I am sometimes

I am the wisest woman you've ever met
I am the kindest soul with whom you've connected
I have the bravest heart that you've
Ever seen, and you've never met anyone
As positive as I am sometimes

You see everything
You see every part
You see all my light
And you love my dark
You dig everything
Of which I'm ashamed
There's not anything
To which you can't relate
And you're still here

I blame everyone else, not my own partaking
My passive aggressiveness can be devastating
I'm terrified and mistrusting, and you've never met anyone
As close to down as I am sometimes

You see everything
You see every part
You see all my light
And you love my dark
You dig everything
Of which I'm ashamed
There's not anything
To which you can't relate
And you're still here

What I resist, persists,
And speaks louder than I know
But I resist, you love,
No matter how low or high I go

I'm the funniest woman that you've ever known
I'm the dullest woman that you've ever known
I'm the most gorgeous woman that you've
Ever known, and you've never met anyone
As everything as I am sometimes

You see everything
You see every part
You see all my light
And you love my dark
You dig everything
Of which I'm ashamed
There's not anything
To which you can't relate

And you're still here

And you're still here
Still here
You are
Still here
