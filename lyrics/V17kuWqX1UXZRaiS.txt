Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes, aaaaaah

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gently
That when she passes
Each one she passes goes, aaaaaah

Ooh, but he watches so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at him

Tall, and tan, and young, and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
He smiles, but she doesn't see

Ooh, but he sees her so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at him

Tall, and tan, and young, and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes...
