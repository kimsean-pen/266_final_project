I close my eyes
The lantern dies
The scent of awakening
Wild-honey and dew
Childhood games
Woods and lakes
Streams of silver
Toys of olden days

Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven

The flowers of wonder
And the hidden treasures
In the meadow of life
My acre of Heaven
A five-year-old winter heart
In a place called home
Sailing the waves of past

Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven

Rocking chair without a dreamer
A wooden swing without laughter
Sandbox without toy soldiers
Yuletide without the flight
Dream-bound for life

Flowers wither
Treasures stay hidden
Until I see the first star of fall
I fall asleep and see it all
Mother's care and color of the kites

(Heaven)
(Heaven)

Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven
(Heaven)
Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven
(Heaven, Heaven, Heaven)
