Knew that it was wrong the first night I met you
When I sneaked back into bed
And you said I love you
Up in this house, blood runs cold
Secret codes, were all we know

We gotta tear it all down, set it on fire
Watch it burn to the ground, it kills us just a little
But a little's alright, 'cause
Oh, it ain't forever
You'll find someone
Find someone who loves you better

Yeah, you'll find someone
Find someone who loves you better
Babe, you'll find the one
You'll find someone

Your friends always liked me
But I told you that you should've listened
'Cause pick the wings off of angels
Has always been my religion
You been sticking 'round
Far too long
And I been running round
And it just feels wrong

We gotta tear it all down, set it on fire
Watch it burn to the ground, it kills us just a little
But a little's alright, 'cause
Oh, it ain't forever
You'll find someone
Find someone who loves you better

Yeah, you'll find someone
Find someone who loves you better
Babe, you'll find the one
You'll find someone

Oh, we gotta tear it all down, set it on fire
Watch it burn to the ground, it kills us just a little
But a little's alright, 'cause
Oh, it ain't forever
You'll find someone
Find someone who loves you better

Woah, babe, you'll find someone
Yeah, someone who could love you better
Woah, babe, you'll find the one
You'll find someone
