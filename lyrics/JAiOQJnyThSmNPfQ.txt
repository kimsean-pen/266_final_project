Any infection? (Imperfection!)
Any affliction? (Don't you settle!)
Spread the addiction! (Take some action!)
Any disorder? (Imperfection!)
Bi- or tri-polar? (Imperfection!)
For your protection (Don't you settle!)
Just an injection! (Take some action!)

One bitter pill, hard to take
And one more each day just to feel the the same
Kill the pain
I kill the pain

Any disorder?
No concentration?
Too hard to handle?
No hesitation!
For your protection
Just an injection!
We'll write you a letter
The younger, the better

One for your heart, for your head
One for every monster under your bed
Kill the pain
I kill the pain

Your body is a battleground
And chemicals are scattered 'round
Your body is a battleground
But don't think you can do without

Your body is an industry
Your pain nothing but gain to me
Your body is an industry
You can't break free, you can't break free

Your body is a battleground
And chemicals are scattered 'round
Your body is a battleground
But don't think you can do without

Your body is an industry
Your pain nothing but gain to me
Your body is an industry
You can't break free, you can't break free
No!

Any disorder?
For your protection
Spread the addiction
