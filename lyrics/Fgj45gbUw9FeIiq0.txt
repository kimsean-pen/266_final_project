The hours of the day have departed
they folded their wings to rest
when the last red ray of sunlight
faded away in the west
and fleecy clouds cover the stars
and beyond is a world of blue.

Away to a world of azure
where white-winged spirits meet
while the clouds float and fade below them
and the stars shine at their feet.

They hold out their hands in welcome
and now, for a moment of time
limitless worlds and boundless space
and planets â€“
they all are mine.
