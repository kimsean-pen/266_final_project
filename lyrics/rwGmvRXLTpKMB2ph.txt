Hey dad
I'm writing to you
not to tell you, that I still hate you
just to ask you
how you feel
and how we fell apart

how this fell apart
are you happy out there in this great wide world?
do you think about your sons?
do you miss your little girl?
when you lay your head down
how do you sleep at night?

do you even wonder if we're all right?
but we're all right

we're all right
it's been a long hard road without you by my side
why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
you broke my mother's heart
you broke your children for life
it's not ok
but we're all right
I remember the days, you were a hero in my eyes
but those were just a long lost memory of mine

I spent so many years learning how to survive
Now, I'm writing just to let you know that I'm still alive
the days I spent so cold, so hungry
were full of hate
I was so angry
those scars run deep inside this tattooed body

there's things I'll take, to my grave
but I'm okay
I'm okay
it's been a long hard road without you by my side
why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
you broke my mother's heart
you broke your children for life
it's not ok
but we're all right
I remember the days, you were a hero in my eyes

but those were just a long lost memory of mine
Now, I'm writing just to let you know that I'm still alive
yeah, I'm still alive
sometimes?
I forgive

yeah and this time
I'll admit
that I miss you, said I miss you
it's been a long hard road without you by my side
why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
you broke my mother's heart
you broke your children for life
it's not ok

but we're all right
I remember the days, you were a hero in my eyes
but those were just a long lost memory of mine
Now, I'm writing just to let you know that were still alive
and sometimes
I forgive
and this time
I'll admit, that I miss you, miss you
hey dad
