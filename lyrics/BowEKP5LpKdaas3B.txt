You say that you are my love then I'm a believer
You reach a hand out to me then I'm gonna hold it
You fill my eyes with your smiles my brain with you chemicals
I forgot to say, I forgot to say
I'll just say something dumb anyway
And everything is a layer that gets in between us
And every kiss is a countdown time till the next one
This time we're under the sheets and really baby I wanna make something else
Something new, something different, something with you

You know my heart feels the hurt when you turn the heat up
Sometimes we're missing the man when it's time to stand up
I feel the pressure like I hear music
I'm only doing the best I can, the best I can
I am trying the best I can

With nobody else left to call
With nobody else left at all
Is when you finally back down, get your back up off the wall
Well what else is there left to know
There wasn't us four months ago
Until somebody backed down, body backed down from the show

This time we'll come up for love
This time we'll come up for love

You say that you are my love then I'm a believer
You reach a hand out to me then I'm gonna hold it
You fill my eyes with your smiles my brain with you chemicals
I forgot to say, I forgot to say
I'll just say something dumb anyway like
Oh lover don't you fake it
Oh lover won't you figure it out

With nobody else left to call
With nobody else left at all
Is when you finally back down, get your back up off the wall
Well what else is there left to know
There wasn't us four years ago
Until somebody stood up, we picked ourselves up off the floor

This time we'll come up for love
This time we'll come up for love
