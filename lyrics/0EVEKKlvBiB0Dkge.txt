It's not quite a mystery
I'm the one who's insecure
You're the one that makes believe
That we're all okay, we're doing fine
When we're both fighting just to stay
To stay alive
A fragile state of mind
That I can't quite survive

Without a doubt, I need your help
I know you've heard me ask before
But come on girl, I need to tell you now
I know what I've done wrong

The only way out of here
Is the way I've avoided for all my life
There's so many things I wanna say
But there's too many things still in the way
I'm lost, please help me find my place
You're the only one, please lead me out of the dark
Please lead me out of the dark
Please lead me out of the dark

I'm moving on, I'll promise change
If you will let me in again, I swear today
I'll be a better man
I'll be who I was then

It's been a long two years
I can't change the past
I've shed so many tears
Can't believe I've lasted this long
I see now that I'm wrong

The only way out of here
Is the way I've avoided for all my life
There's so many things I wanna say
But there's too many things still in the way
I'm lost, please help me find my place
You're the only one, please lead me out of the dark
Please lead me out of the dark
Uhh-uhh-uhh
