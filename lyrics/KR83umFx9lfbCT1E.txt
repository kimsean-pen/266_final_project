What's going on
The look in your eyes tells me there is something wrong
Stay with me, help is on the way
Just try to breathe
Can you hear my voice
Let it guide you through all of the noise
Your lips are blue
I would sell my soul for you to pull through

I've been dancing with your ghost
Some might say that we have stole the show
All the memorys that are haunting me
I refuse to let you go
I've been dancing with your ghost

What's going on
I can feel the crowd thinking "oh my god"
Please just move
Can anyone here me - let me through
I can see your face
Calling your name
Reaching out
I can't feel anything
Forever in love, too
I'm always yours

I've been dancing with your ghost
Some might say that we have stole the show
All the memorys that are haunting me
I refuse to let you go
I've been dancing with your ghost

I have been waiting
I have been waiting

All the memorys
There are haunting me

I've been dancing with your ghost
Some might say that we have stole the show
All the memorys that are haunting me
I refuse to let you go
I've been dancing with your ghost
