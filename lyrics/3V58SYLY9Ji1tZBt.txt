Yes, I'm only a man
Judgements of something ancient
Clocking my time as finished
The same is all replacements
Ignorance is complacency
Why are you purposely fading?
No stand, no sit, no stopping
Ripping through the neon prophecies
Got let off by a ticket stub
My time is fading fast
Through your mouth and out yours'

(You never do what you say)
Say what?
(Shine till the sun comes up)
Come down
(You oughta wash your hands and pray)
For what?
(Shaking hands, swapping dirty blood)
Pass it round
(You never do what you say)
Say what?
(Shine till the sun comes up)
For now
(You promise that you'll come around?)
I'll be around

So I fear, but I don't know what it is
So I want, but I pretend I don't need

So here's the pain of the stubbled lover's kiss
I throw my pages all away like shaking wrists

So shake me down
Shake me up (shake me down, shake me down)
So shake me down
Shake me up (shake me down, shake me down)
So shake me up

(You never do what you say)
Say what?
(Shine till the sun comes up)
Hey now
(You oughta wash your hands and pray)
For what?
(Shaking hands, swapping dirty blood)
Pass it round

(You never do what you say)
Say what?
(Shine till the sun comes up)
Come down
(You promise that you'll come around?)
I'll be around

I tell me it ain't hard
As I hold my breath thinking why
Tell me to my beating heart
That I know for sure
Better than I can know for sure
What it did
My mistakes bend like payphone metal
I never know just what will come
As our [?] hands bind together
River and me children
Longer than a trillion
Get what I am given, forever
(So shake me up)

(You never do what you say)

Say what?
(Shine till the sun comes up)
Come down
(You oughta wash your hands and pray)
For what?
(Shaking hands, swapping dirty blood)
Pass it round
(You never do what you say)
Say what?
(Shine till the sun comes up)
For now
(You promise that you'll come around?)
