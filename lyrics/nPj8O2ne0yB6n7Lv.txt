I don't even know myself at all
I thought I would be happy by now
The more I try to push it I realize
Gotta let go of control

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
So let it happen

It's just a spark
But it's enough
To keep me going

And when it's dark out
No one's around
It keeps glowing

Every night I try my best to dream
Tomorrow makes it better
And I wake up to the cold reality
Not a thing has changed

But it will happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

It's just a spark
But it's enough
To keep me going

And when it's dark out
No one's around
It keeps glowing (ah)

It's just a spark
But it's enough
To keep me going

And when it's dark out
No one's around
It keeps glowing

And the salt in my wounds
Isn't burning anymore than it used to
It's not that I don't feel the pain
It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore

And the blood in these veins
Isn't pumping any less than it ever has
And that's the hope I have
The only thing I know is keeping me alive
Alive

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

It's just a spark
But it's enough
To keep me going
(So if I let go of control)
(Now, I can be strong)

And when it's dark out
No one's around
It keeps glowing (ah)
It's just a spark
But it's enough
To keep me going
(So if I keep my eyes close)
(With the blind hope)
And when it's dark out
No one's around
It keeps glowing
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Mm-mm-mm, ah-ah.
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm
