The leaves, they don't change here
The leaves don't change here, so I never saw it coming
Winter hit me, Hiroshima, where did the sun go?
Just the cruel rain pouring, you say that it's over
How could it be over, when I never saw it coming?

Sweet California, sour California
Sweet California, bitter California
Sweet California
I should've known better, I should've known better
Cause the leaves don't change here

Heart caught in a rift, cold Pacific waters
Keep on pulling me under, drowning in my sorrows
Eager waves keep on crashing, you say that it's over
How could it be over? I never saw it coming

Sweet California, sour California
Sweet California, bitter California
Sweet California
I should've known better, I should've known better
The leaves, they don't change here

You know I'm from here, I never saw it coming
Where did the summer go, when you loved me?
Where did the summer go, when you loved me?
You say it's over now, how could it be over?
I never saw it coming

Sweet California, sour California
Sweet California, bitter California
Sweet California, oh, I should've known better
Should've known better
The leaves, they don't change here
