The highway was teasing me with promises and visions of a country unseen
In a black limousine
For the better part of my twenties on the corner of this dirty street

A decade in the making
Just a loser on two tender feet
Saying dreams come true
Dreams come true

Dreams come true

Dreams come true
She wasn't having anything
No birds or any bees, girl
Don't go shooting all the dogs down, just cause one's got fleas
I'll bite what turns you sour, baby
I've got miles per hour, lady
Make up your mind
You never know what you might find
When dreams come true
Dreams come true
Yes, they do
Dreams come true
Dreams come true
Dreams come true
Yes, they do
Dreams come true
Punch the clock
Baby, on the nightstand
You close your eyes
Waiting for the Sandman
Spend your life
Bracing for the crash land
You forget
Baby, it's a dreamland
Baby, it's a dreamland
A natural believer
I don't carry any bones
If you see things a little different
I'm not casting any stones
You're taking it for granted, I've got the right to speak my mind
I'll overcome the dark, just like the dead, the lame, the leper, & the blind man
Like Lazarus or the mother of Peter's wife
Ha
Punch the clock
Baby, on the nightstand
You close your eyes
Waiting for the Sandman
Spend your life
Bracing for the crash land
You forget
Baby, it's a dreamland
Take a chance
Underneath the streetlight
Cross my heart
Everything is alright
I don't waste my time
On "Where do I park the car?"
I don't stand in line
& it's treated me
Alright so far
If dreams come true
I get to drink the cup
But one fine day
We'll find a better way
(Gonna have a lot to say)
Punch the clock
Baby, on the nightstand
You close your eyes
Waiting for the Sandman
Spend your life
Bracing for the crash land
You forget
Baby, it's a dreamland
Take the chance
Underneath the streetlight
Cross my heart
Everything is alright
In the blackness of the night
Everything is alright
