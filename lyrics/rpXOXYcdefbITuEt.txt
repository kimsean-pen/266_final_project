My hours live in double time,
A headache lives between my eyes.
I hold it hostage to a fault,
And blame it when I lose my sight.
It's things like this that make me,
So frustrated on the daily.
So bare with me while I lose my cool,
I swear it's all just momentary.
I'll watch you from my telescope;
My eyes stuck to my favorite show,
I barely get more than a glimpse,
But it's better than nothing, yeah, I know.
I'll watch you from my telescope
The times I'm feeling far from home.
From outer space the street looks small,
So small I wanna
Drop it right now.
You're one of my favorite few.
Can't stop me right now,
Like you'd even want to.
What do I do?
You're one of my favorite few.
You're one of my favorite few.
You're one of my favorite few.
I'm sorry about that, you know I'm sorry about me,
It's just that it's not fun when I find out you're playing for the other team.
It seems like a crash landing will always just come in handy,
As I watch plan B and C escape,
I'll hold them off until they don't let me-
Watch you from my telescope;
My eyes stuck to my favorite show,
I barely get more than a glimpse,
But it's better than nothing, yeah, I know.
I'll watch you from my telescope
The times I'm feeling far from home.
From outer space the street looks small,
So small I wanna
Drop it right now.
You're one of my favorite few.
Can't stop me right now,
Like you'd even want to.
What do I do?
You're one of my favorite few.
You're one of my favorite few.

One of my favorite,
Drop it right now.

What do I do?
You're one of my favorite,
Coming to take it,
One of my favorite few.
You're one of my favorite few.
