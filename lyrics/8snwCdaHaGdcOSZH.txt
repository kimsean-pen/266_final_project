So many heartaches I put you through
so much trouble and pain
so many tears I made you cry
I'll never put you though that again

I'm gonna make every minute count
and cover you with all my love

If it makes you feel good
I'm gonna give it all up to you
if it makes you feel good
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true

You're not alone in the world
there's always someone who cares
this time I'm sure I'm your girl
I'm not going anywhere

Let me show you what the girl can do
I'll cover you with all my love

If it makes you feel good
I'm gonna make it all up to you
if it makes you feel good
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true

If it makes you feel good
I'm gonna make it all up to you
if it makes you feel good
I'm gonna love you through, through and through

I kept you waiting for so long
now I see that I was wrong
I guess love you oh so much
now I thrill to your touch

I kept you waiting for so long
now that's all in the past
don't you say you can't go on
I'm gonna give you love that lasts

I'm gonna make ever minute count
and cover you with all my love

If it makes you feel good
I'm gonna make it all up to you
if it makes you feel good
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true

If it makes you feel good
I'm gonna make it all up to you
if it makes you feel good
I'm gonna love you through, through and through
