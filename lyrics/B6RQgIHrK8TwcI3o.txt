If I sing you a love song,
Will you always remember
Will you hear it on lonely nights,
When I'm not around

If I sing you a love song,
Will you hear it forever
To remind you how much
I care and how I needed you.

Love songs last longer than lovers ever do
So baby let me sing a love song for you
Love songs don't leave you but lovers often do
Oh, baby I'm afraid it could happen to me and you

If I sing you a love song
Let it always be with you
When the others have gone away
Let it still be there

Love songs last longer than lovers ever do
So baby let me sing a love song for you
Love songs don't leave you like lovers often do
Oh, baby I'm afraid it could happen to me and you

Ohh ohh ohh
Lonely nights
When I'm not around
Baby it's a love song so always remember

On lonely nights
I'll sing you a love song
To keep you close to me
I'll sing you a love song...
