In the night time
When the world is at its rest
You will find me
In the place I love the best
Dancing, shouting
Flying to the moon
Don't have to worry
'Cause I'll be come back soon

And we build a castle
In the sky and in the sand
Design our own world
Ain't nobody understand
I find myself alive
In the palm of your hand
As long as we are flying
All this world ain't got no end
All this world ain't got no end

In the daytime
You will find me by your side
Trying to do my best
Trying to make things right
When it all turns wrong
There is no smoke but fire
But it won't hit hard
You'll let me shine

And we build a castle
In the sky and in the sand
Design our own world
Ain't nobody understand
I find myself alive
In the palm of your hand
As long as we are flying
All this world ain't got no end
All this world ain't got no end

All this world ain't got no end
