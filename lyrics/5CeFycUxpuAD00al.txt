Hmm, yeah, your burn me, again
Well, I don't know wanna, where know you've been?
I was your new best friend
Do you know I'll treat you like them?
And I know

You're under my skin
Burning in my bloodstream
These scars were the way that you love me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Burning in my bloodstream
These scars were the way that you love me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me

Apologies for the way I've been
I couldn't wash you off my skin
No, I, I couldn't live without you
Um, tears at night could drive but I know
I'm burning right the wire and lifeboats
You could be in the way you play me

And I know

You're under my skin
Burning in my bloodstream
These scars were the way that you love me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Burning in my bloodstream
These scars were the way that you love me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me

See these scars leaving blood on my little white dress
Leaving hard, heal me now, now

You're under my skin
Burning in my bloodstream
These scars were the way that you love me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Burning in my bloodstream
These scars were the way that you love me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo
You're under my skin
Burning in my bloodstream
These scars were the way that you love me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
