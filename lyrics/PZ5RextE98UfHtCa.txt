Will you count me in?

I've been awake for a while now
You got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face...
I get "the tinglies" in a silly place

It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now

Just take your time
Wherever you go
The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place

Under cover stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore
They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know

That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time

Wherever you go
But what am I gonna say
When you make me feel this way?
I just... mmmmm...
And it starts in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose

Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now

Just take your time
Wherever you go
I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose
The feelin' shows
'Cause you make me smile
Baby, just take your time now
Holdin' me ti-i-ight

Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Oh, wherever you go
I always know
'Cause you make me smile
Even just for a while
