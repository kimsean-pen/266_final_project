Hammer high this is a freedom cry!
Hammer high, no one should ask me why!
It's my life - Proudly I will defy!
Hammer high until I die!

Black clouds on the horizon
Dread crimson skies
The thunder within
The sign to begin
A tempest of fire and ice
I keep my courage blazing
Withhold this grounds
Protecting the steal
This is my deal
The flames of thy anger, my will!

Remember the frozen tears
Turning each second to Years
A meltdown in paradise
Revolution calling! Break the ice!

Hammer high this is a freedom cry!
Hammer high, no one should ask me why!
It's my life - Proudly I will defy!
Hammer high until I die!

The rapid fire pounding
To the beat of my heart
Lets make a stand
True to till the end
A Warrior under command

I'm melting the frozen ice
Burning the books filled with lies
And inside the pouring rain
Things will never ever be the same!

Hammer high this is a freedom cry!
Hammer high, no one should ask me why!
It's my life - Proudly I will defy!
Hammer high until I die!

The strong will survive
In the end, it's the game
Forever defy!
Hammer high up in the sacred sky!

Hammer high this is a freedom cry!
Hammer high, no one should ask me why!
It's my life - Proudly I will defy!
Hammer high until I die!

Hear me now this is a freedom cry
It's my life - no one should ask me why!
Hammer high I won't conform and i
Will defy until i die

Hammer high this is a freedom cry!
Hammer high, no one should ask me why!
It's my life - Proudly I will defy!
Hammer high until I die!
