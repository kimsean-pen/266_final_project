Bring me back to holding hands in the rain
I swear I'd ease your pain.
Lift you up so you could finally see
The love you are to me.
Why'd I have to go and do you like that?
Thought I'd moved on, but you brought me right back.
To the night you took my kiss away from me.
I took yours too, then I lost you.
Would you, Bring me back to holding hands in the rain
I swear I'd ease your pain.
Lift you up so you could finally see
The love you are to me.
I've had time and I've had change
I've been broken but still I can't explain.
Our July in the Rain
Every part of me is Broken now.
I tried to scream but nothing came out.
Drop my pride I reveal my insides
And It all came pouring out.
Would you, Bring me back to holding hands in the rain
I swear I'd ease your pain.
Lift you up so you could finally see
The love you are to me.
I've had time and I've had change
I've been broken but still I can't explain.
Our July in the Rain
This a melody. We'll never speak.
All the things that I've regret if I could say anything.
My apologies for the way I ended things
See, I love you, but its killing me.
Its killing me.
Would you please...
Bring me back to holding hands in the rain
I swear I'd ease your pain.
Lift you up so you could finally see
The love you are to me.
I've had time and I've had change
I've been broken but still I can't explain.
Our July...
Would you, Bring me back to holding hands in the rain
I swear I'd ease your pain.
Lift you up so you could finally see
The love you are to me.
I've had time and I've had change
I've been broken but still I can't explain.
Our July...
