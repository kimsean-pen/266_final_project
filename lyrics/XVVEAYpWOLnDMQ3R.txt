Night passing through windows
Turning them on
Turning them off

Sometimes all I've got is other people's windows
Sometimes all I've got is other people's windows
Seeing through me

Let them find you when you know you're lost
you've been kneeling in a false dawn
Let them take you coz you don't belong
In these waves
In these waves

Time will come to life again
My strange harvest
Will taste sweet again

Something I can't touch is reaching out for me
Something I can't touch is reaching out for me
Seeing through me

(Seeing through me)

Let them find you when you know you're lost
you've been kneeling in a false dawn
Let them take you coz you don't belong
In these waves
In these waves
