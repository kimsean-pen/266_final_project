You over there causing commotion
So I decided follow the crowd
To get to you I'd cross the ocean
I'd travel time, I want you

Boy, bring it on
I'ma be the one to take you higher
Boy, bring it on
I want you hot like sun
I'ma be the one to light your fire
Boy, bring it on

We go all in tonight
To get you in tonight
You've got the brightest light
Shine it on me
Don't let the music stop
Don't let my heart be dropped
Your light is so damn hot
Shine it on me

Shine it on, shine it on, shine it on me
Shine it on, shine it on, shine it on me
Shine it on, shine it on, shine it on me
Shine it on, shine it on, shine it on me

The night is young, so let's embrace it
I take control, follow you down
Where you belong is here beside me
So here we go, I need you

Boy, bring it on
I'ma be the one to take you higher
Boy, bring it on
I want you hot like sun
I'ma be the one to light your fire
Boy, bring it on

We go all in tonight
To get you in tonight
You've got the brightest light
Shine it on me
Don't let the music stop
Don't let my heart be dropped
Your light is so damn hot
Shine it on me

Shine it on, shine it on, shine it on me
Shine it on, shine it on, shine it on me
Shine it on, shine it on, shine it on me
Shine it on, shine it on, shine it on me

Boy that's desire
Come and light my fire
Come and light the flame
And shine, shine it on me
Boy that's desire
Come and light my fire
Come and light the flame
And shine, shine it on me

We go all in tonight
To get you in tonight
You've got the brightest light
Shine it on me
Don't let the music stop
Don't let my heart be dropped
Your light is so damn hot
Shine it on me

We go all in tonight
To get you in tonight
You've got the brightest light
Shine it on me
Don't let the music stop
Don't let my heart be dropped
Your light is so damn hot
Shine it on me

Shine it on, shine it on, shine it on me
Shine it on, shine it on, shine it on me
Shine it on, shine it on, shine it on me
Shine it on, shine it on, shine it on me.
