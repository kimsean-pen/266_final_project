We want to learn
the art of darkness
We are the children
of the fallen faith
Life's to short
to know the power
Of the almighty
and the ancient ones

We laugh at those
who want to live forever
Hold on to their hope,
hold on to their fears
Enter and leave
this world empty handed
We'd rather burn
than fade away

We are the children of haze
We are the children of haze
We set our lives ablaze
We are the children...

Close to the edge
we're dancing madly
Hypnotized
by eternal haze
We are the servants
left by their master
We are the children
living just to die

We are the children of haze
We are the children of haze
We set our lives ablaze
We are the children...

We are the children of haze
We are the children of haze
We set our lives ablaze
We are the children...
