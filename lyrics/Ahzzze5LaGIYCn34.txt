Drifting in and out of consciousness
What is this about?
What kind of highs can an optimist achieve?

Massive padded walls
It's all a blur again
I'm scratchin' at them all
It's all a blur and then,
Come on and work with me
I'm on it
It could be worse
Dishonesty won't serve you now

There's a lock on the door and you probably should knock
It's not going to get you in
Even the sound of your voice when it drops
Couldn't disturb me then
Hasn't disturbed me since
What's with the shit eating grin?

Massive padded walls
It's all a blur again
I'm scratchin' at them all
It's all a blur and then,
Come on and work with me
I'm on it
It could be worse
Dishonesty won't serve you now

'Cause I'm not getting out

I'm begging you
I'm begging you for asylum

Massive padded walls
It's all a blur again
I'm scratchin' at them all
It's all a blur and then,
Come on and work with me
I'm on it
It could be worse
Dishonesty won't serve you now

'Cause I'm not getting out...
