Attero!
Dominatus!
Berlin is burning
Denique!
Interimo!
The Reich has fallen!

We stand at the gates of Berlin
With two and a half million men
With six thousand tanks in our ranks
Use them as battering rams

Artillery leading our way
A million grenades has been launched
The Nazis must pay for their crimes
The wings of the eagle has been broken

Marshall Zhukov's orders:
"Serve me Berlin on a plate!"
Disregard the losses
The city is ours to take

Attero!
Dominatus!
Berlin is burning
Denique!
Interimo!
The Reich has fallen!

The price of a war must be paid
Millions of lives have been lost
The price must be paid by the men
That started the war in the 30's

The spring of the year '45
The year when the Nazis will fall
We're inside the gates of Berlin
The beak of the eagle has been broken

Comrade Stalin's orders:
"Serve me its head on a plate"
Disregard the losses
The eagle's land is ours to take

Attero!
Dominatus!
Berlin is burning
Denique!
Interimo!
The Reich has fallen!

March!
Fight!
Die!
In Berlin!
March!
Fight!
Conquer!
Berlin!

Attero!
Dominatus!
Berlin is burning
Denique!
Interimo!
The Reich has fallen!
Attero!
Dominatus!
Berlin is burning
Denique!
Interimo!
The Reich has fallen!
Attero!
