I'm difficult to love at the best of times
oh at the best of times
I'm difficult to love at the best of times
oh at the best of times
I should go before I say something I shouldn't say
Cause I'm pretty sure that you expect me to fuck up again
(And) Maybe you're right I might (uuh) but you could be surprised
(Cause) Maybe you're wrong we're young
Oh and I got a little time BUT
I'm difficult to love at the best of times
oh at the best of times
I'm difficult to love at the best of times
oh at the best of times
I'm High again (Hii hiii HIIIGH) and maybe that was my mistake (my mistake, my mistake, uuuhmmm)
You said I waste time and I never get why
You're in love with me
Maybe you're right but I don't like the way we fight Oh and you could be surprised
(Cause) Maybe you're wrong we're young
Oh and I got a little time BUT
I'm difficult to love OH I'm difficult (OH) I'm difficult, I'm difficult I'm difficult to love
I'm difficult to love at the best of times
oh at the best of times
I'm difficult to love at the best of times
oh at the best of times
I'm difficult to love at the best of times
Oh at the best of times
I'm difficult to love at the best of times
Oh at the best of times
I'M DIFFICULT (I'M DIFFICULT, I'M DIFFICULT)
