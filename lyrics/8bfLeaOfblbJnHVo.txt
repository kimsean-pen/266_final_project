I wish I told you
I'm still me
And I'm so
I love your family
I wish I told you
I'm still me
And I'm so
I love your family
I forget that other people haven't been in my head
I get scared that other people haven't been in my head
I'll make this real
Am I forgetting what
I'll be silent
But I apologise
You make this real
But you're forgetting what
You'll be silent
But you'll apologise
I forget that other people haven't been in my head
I get scared that other people haven't been in my head
I forget that other people haven't been in my head
I get scared that other people haven't been in my head
