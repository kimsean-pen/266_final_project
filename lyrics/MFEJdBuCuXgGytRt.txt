Drawn aback
You're on my mind your name is in my ceilin'
And how I know, I know you're mine
For you are not leavin'
I hear your shinin'
I feel your poundin'
Now you're mine
You're mine again
Swear you'll never leave me
In my mind I hear the song
Its playing while im dreamin'
I didn't mean to make it real
but couldn't sound my feelin'
I hear your cryin'
I feel your whinin'
Now you're mine, you're mine again
Swear you'll never leave me
ohh ohh Jerome
ooh ohh Jerome
I'm screamin' at nothin Jerome
You got me for nothin Jerome
