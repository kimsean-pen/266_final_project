I can't count
What's the number of the jokes I've seen
A thousand in nine five now
Profit trial for the public files
I can't hear them
Without a taste of doubt
And still I doubt
That's what I'm all about
It's all my doubt

I can't stand back
Watch you waste another try
Don't drop it on me so quick
Don't hit me with a pile of bricks
I won't preach
The comfort of this void we've reached
But I was born on the gemini cusp
And that's enough of trust
