I'd never seem you out
I'd never chase you down
Cause I've seen the age to come
Victory for no one

You never cooled the fire
But you incite your crowd
Can't see what you've become
A crown with no kingdom

(Refr達o)
And now you see the Angels
Gathering above you
Trading down the stars
Diamonds in the dark
Fires in the sky
Lighting up the earth
Now you see the Angels

You only play to win
Laugh at the ones who lose
There's millions shouting out your name
Still you light the fuse

You say you want to fight
Then you always run
You don't want to die
Still you shoot the loaded gun

(Refr達o)
And now you see the Angels
Gathering above you
Trading down the stars
Diamonds in the dirt
Fires in the sky
Lighting up the earth
Now you see the Angels

(Refr達o)
And now you see the Angels
Gathering above you
Trading down the stars
Diamonds in the dirt
Fires in the sky
Lighting up the earth
Now you see the Angels

(Refr達o)
And now you see the Angels
Gathering above you
Trading down the stars
Diamonds in the dark
Fires in the sky
Lighting up the earth
Now you see the Angels

Angels
