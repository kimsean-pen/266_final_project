The colder the night, the warmer your hands hold
Held in your arms, the hole in my head grows whole

I don't want to die alone, but I don't wanna die at all
I'm not gonna keep you be the phone, dear
Hang up when you've had enough
Too much to talk
Call me when you're coming down, call me when you hang
All is well that ends well, but all is well that ends

Clocks made God from the monsters in my head
Do you wanna know my name
Is that all you want to take from me
In your arms the end is in my eyes
And I don't want to die in my sleep when you're left

Call me when you hang and
Call me when you're left
Call me when you come down
Call me when you hang

I don't want to die alone, but I don't wanna die at all
I'm not gonna keep you by the phone dear
Hang up when you've had enough
Too much to talk
Call me when you're coming down, call me when you hang
All is well that ends well, but all is well that ends
Call me when you hang
Call me when you
Hang your head and cry if you like, but all is well that ends
