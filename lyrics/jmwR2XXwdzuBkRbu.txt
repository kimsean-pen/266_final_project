They'll love you too
They'll love you too
They'll love you too
They'll love you too
They'll come to you
They'll come to you
They'll come to you
They'll come to you too

They'll worship you
They'll worship you
They'll worship you
They'll worship you
They'll come to you
They'll use you too
They'll sell you too
And they'll steal from you too

There'll be no apologies
And no more security
There will be no cops
Just men with guns
In their shiny black uniforms
And their big black boots
With their shiny black batons
And their sleek black cars
With their fingers on the trigger
With their fingers on the trigger
With their fingers on the trigger
And their skeleton keys

And there will be no marches
And there will be no purity
And no more TV
And no more motorcades

And no horses, there'll be no horses
No horses, no more motorcades

There's a sky full of tears
A sky full of tears
There's a sky full of tears
A sky full of tears
I've been awake all night
And the sun don't shine
And the night's so long
That the moon is in shock
And all the lovers turn cops
And all the lovers turn cops
Oh all the lovers turn cops
Oh all the lovers turn cops

No horses, there'll be no horses
No horses, no more motorcades
No horses, there'll be no horses
No horses, no more motorcades

There'll be nothing to believe
Nothing to lose
There'll be nothing to hide
And there'll be nothing to grow
There'll be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Cause this is the apocalypse
Yeah, this is the apocalypse
This is the apocalypse
That killed the horses
