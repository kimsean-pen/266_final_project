And I can still see the eyes
His brown eyes
He was looking deeper into me than I would've liked
Nah I don't have any change on me man, I'm sorry
Could've made a contribution
And I can still see the eyes
Her green eyes
She was busy with her friends
But I wanted her to notice me, like
Yo, how are you?
Yeah nah, I've never been more content
Could've told her the truth
And I can still see the eyes
The red eyes of those around me
They like doing it
And wish to grow into the shoes of their idols
What nah nah it's cool man
It's really, it's not me but
Thanks anyway
Could've had a fun night
And I can still see the eyes
His brown eyes
He was looking deeper into me than I would've liked
And I don't have any change on me man, I'm sorry

But I should've given him the coins in my pockets
Could've stopped and opened my wallet
Could've done what's right because he wants it
But who doesn't want it
See money is the only motive
But money is a sin and I loath it
The reason we're waiting for something
The only reason why people are hungry, child
People are hungry now
Money, the reason that we can't make money
The reason why a prick is running the country
No matter when you hear this note
There's always gonna be a prick running this country
But you better get your votes in
(Let's get your votes in)
Best get your votes in
Because
They know best
