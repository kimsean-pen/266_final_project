I found a place that is holy
Somewhere to feel like a child
Where I escape when I'm lonely
For a while

When I'm needing resurrection
Something to bring me to life
Whenever I'm craving attention
Inside

But I can't stay
It's so wrong, it's so right
It's a fool's paradise
And I can't stay
It's so wrong, it's so right
It's a fool's paradise

Back to the real world
Into the gray
Back to the real world
All the color's fading
Back to the real world
Can't run away
Back to the real world
All the color's fading

It's hard to hold onto a feeling
When nothing is left in your hands
Was it for real? Was I dreaming?
I don't understand

Why I can't stay
It's so wrong, it's so right
It's a fool's paradise
And I can't stay
It's so wrong, it's so right
It's a fool's paradise

Back to the real world
Into the gray
Back to the real world
All the color's fading
Back to the real world
Can't run away
Back to the real world
All the color's fading

Paradise, paradise, paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise

Back to the real world
Into the gray
Back to the real world
All the color's fading
Back to the real world
Can't run away
Back to the real world
All the color's fading

Paradise, paradise, paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise
