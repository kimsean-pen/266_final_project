Art house director,
We've lost magic flavor (?) 'till tomorrow night.
Art house director,
Art house director,
Make the waters part into an empty heart.
Is life a joke?
Every step of the way.
Is there something coax (?)
The truth of the day
Defeat deflector,
Defeat deflector,
Rushes will not lie, I swear this is your God (?).
And the starlet is a harlot,
She does not leave the trailer,
She thinks that?,
Or someone? for later (?)
Is this life a joke?
Every step of the way.
Is there something to coax (?)
The truth of the day.
Is life a joke?
Ever step of the way.
Is there someone to coax (?)
The truth of the day.

I never meant for it to be that way,
But since I have your attention,
I'll just give you what you want,
Maybe I'll leave in the the trailer (?)

Canyon connector,
Purest protector,
All the? fell through,
We can't escape the gloom.
And the starlet is a harlot,
She will not leave the trailer,
She says that you betrayed her,
With a surfer from the?
Is? like a joke?
Every step of the way.
Is there someone to coax (?)
The truth of the day.
Is? like a joke?
Every step of the way.
Is there someone to coax (?)
The truth of the day.
