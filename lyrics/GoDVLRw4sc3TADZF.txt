Right now I feel
No one can help me
So incomplete
Floating in a dark sea

So I lost who I am, sinking into black
But tonight I won't stay
I will find the way to escape
Oh no, just don't know where to go

Take me, come and take me away
Save me, can't you hear my mayday?
Calling mayday
Calling mayday
Fix me, come and close my eyes and
Drive me to my paradise
Calling mayday
Calling mayday

So many lights I can see through the dark
I still don't know if I can trust anyone
I'm sick and tired of this starless night
Can't you fill up my crave for daylight?

So I lost who I am, sinking into black
But tonight I won't stay
I will find the way to escape
Oh no, just don't know where to go

Take me, come and take me away
Save me, can't you hear my mayday?
Calling mayday
Calling mayday
Fix me, come and close my eyes and
Drive me to my paradise
Calling mayday
Calling mayday

My faded eyes
See the world in black and white
I feel like nothing
Has been
Painted bright

Take me, come and take me away
Save me, can't you hear my mayday?
Calling mayday
Calling mayday
Fix me, come and close my eyes and
Drive me to my paradise
Calling mayday
Calling mayday

Take me
Oh take me home
Calling mayday
Calling mayday
