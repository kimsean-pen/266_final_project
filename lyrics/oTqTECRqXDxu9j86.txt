Watch your step
Hold your breath
I don't wanna see you cry
You are smoke
You come and go
But I just wanna hold you tight
Forget what I said
Shaking my head
I don't wanna see you cry
I just wanna hold you tight
But i gotta say goodnight

You're driving me crazy
You're making run
Stop calling me baby
Look what you've done
I'm living a nightmare
I'm living a dream
Somewhere somewhere somewhere somewhere in between

Heart is racing
Lost control
Take me away
Leave me alone
Forget what I said
Shaking my head
Are you gonna change your mind?
Are we gonna make this right?
Are we gonna say goodbye?

You're driving me crazy
You're making run
Stop calling me baby
Look what you've done
I'm living a nightmare
I'm living a dream
Somewhere somewhere somewhere somewhere in between

Your eyes they talk
(somewhere in between)
Theyre telling stories of
(somewhere in between)
Places you saw
(somewhere in between)
People you love
Somewhere somewhere somewhere somewhere in between

You're driving me crazy
You're making run
Stop calling me baby
Look what you've done
I'm living a nightmare
I'm living a dream
Somewhere somewhere somewhere somewhere in between

You're driving me crazy
You're making run
Stop calling me baby
Look what you've done
I'm living a nightmare
I'm living a dream
Somewhere somewhere somewhere somewhere in between
