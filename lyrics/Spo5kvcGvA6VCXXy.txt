People
people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting our grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children
Than children.
Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people
In the world.
With one person, one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half
Now you're whole.

No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person
Who needs people.
People who need people
Are the luckiest people
In the world!

With one person, one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half
Now you're whole.
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person
Who needs people.
People who need people
Are the luckiest people
In the world!
