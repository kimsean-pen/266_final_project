I stood there beside myself
Thinking hard about the weather
They came by a friend of mine
Suggested we go out together
Then I knew it from the start
This friend of mine would fall apart
Pretending not to see his guilt
I said "Let's go out and have some fun"
I know you know
We believe in a land of love
I know you know
We believe in a land of love
I have always thought about
Staying in and going out
Tonight I should have stayed at home
Playing with my pleasure zone
He has always been so strange
I'd often thought he was deranged
Pretending not to see his gun
I said "Let's go out and have some fun"
I know you know
We believe in a land of love
I know you know
We believe in a land of love
