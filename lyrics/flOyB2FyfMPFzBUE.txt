World where I've been
Bridge in the air
Land that I've seen
Twin of the Earth

Shade on the sun
Shape in the air
Deep silhouette
Keep me in sight

Without seeming to
Standing stone
Standing wave
Standing without standing still
So light (So light)

Standing stone
Standing wave
Standing without standing still
So light (So light)
