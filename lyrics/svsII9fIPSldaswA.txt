I was gonna cancel
then I looked into the sky, knew the badness won't prevent the sun to shine.
I was gonna cancel
then took a sec to realise all the disappointment that would trail behind.
I was gonna cancel
then you reminded me of who I am,
Everything is clearer than a mirror is to woman just the same as a dog is to man.

Just hop out of the bed,
Go ahead face the day,
Who cares what you know,
Don't let that in the way no way,
Shut out all the doubt,
Just get up and go,
What's on the other side?
You will never know unless you,
Go, go, go, go oh,
Go, go, go, go oh,
Go, go, go, go oh,

Go, go, go, go girl.

I was gonna cancel
then I thought about the strength that I got from all of the prayers and what it
meant.
I was gonna cancel
then I realised that time is just that money and the love watch how you spend.
I was gonna cancel

until you reminded me of what I do.
Now I see it clearer,

my best friend is a mirror look behind me and I see all the things I've been through.
Just hop out of the bed,
Go ahead face the day,
Who cares what you know,
Don't let that in the way, no way,
Shut out all the doubt,
Just get up and go,
What's on the other side?
You will never know unless you,

Go, go, go, go oh,
Go, go, go, go oh,
Go, go, go, go oh,

Go, go, go, go girl.
What's wrong with saying I love you?
It's nothing to kid about,
Some people going through a struggle

trying to scribble it out.
They say attention is a shovel,

it's time to dig 'em out.
You can't just let 'em stay in a bubble,

they'll pop to get it out.
What's wrong with love, love?

What's wrong with love, love?
Just hop out of the bed,
Go ahead face the day,
Who cares what you know,
Don't let that in the way no way,
Shut out all the doubt,
Just get up and go,
What's on the other side?
You will never know unless you,
Go, go, go, go oh,
Go, go, go, go oh,
Go, go, go, go oh,
Go, go, go, go girl.
