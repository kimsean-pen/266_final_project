Living high and living free
Advancing up quite easily
Taking no times, but to be in a rut
Believe there's no tomorrow

It will be treacherous
holding down
it will be venturous
and I'll come around

Kill me
Thrill me
Move me through the night
Leave me when I'm all dressed up for action

Kill me
Thrill me
Move me through the night
You cannot play me
Save me

Death rides this night!

Flashing lights I'm moving fast
Reaching even higher
Holding on while it lasts
Gonna set you all afire

It will be treacherous
holding down
it will be venturous
and I'll come around

Kill me
Thrill me
Move me through the night
Leave me when I'm all dressed up for action

Kill me
Thrill me
Move me through the night
You cannot play me
Save me

Death rides this night!
