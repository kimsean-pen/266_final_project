Mmm...
No no no no...
Oh, yeah.

I'm in chains you're in chains too
I wear uniforms and, you wear uniforms too
I'm a prisoner, you're a prisoner too
Mr Jailer

I have fears you have fears too
I will die, yourself will die too
Life is beautiful, don't you think so too
Mr Jailer

I'm talking to you jailer
Stop calling me a prisoner
Let he who is without sin be the first to cast the stone
Mr Jailer
Mr Jailer man

You suppress all my strategies
You oppress every part of me
What you don't know, you're a victim too
Mr Jailer

You don't care about my point of view
If I die another will work for you
So you treat me like a modern slave
Mr Jailer

I'm talking to you jailer
Stop calling me a prisoner
Let he who is without sin be the first to cast the stone
Mr Jailer
Mr Jailer man

You see,
If you walking in a market place
Don't throw stones
Even if you do you just might hit
One of your own
Life is not about your policies
All the time
So you better rearrange your philosophies
And be good to your fellow man, jailer!

Oh, I'm talking to you jailer
Stop calling me a prisoner
Let he who is without sin be the first to cast the stone
Mr Jailer
Mr Jailer

I heard my baby say
I wanna be president
I want chop money
From my government
What he don't know, what he won't know, what he can't know
Jailer, jailer
Oh, be good woah,
Oh, be good woah,
Oh, be good woah,
So better be good woah
Oh, be good woah
Oh, be good woah
Oh, be good woah
