Told you that I can't
Sleep at night till I get an answer
Still, these secrets that you keep,
Like you don't mind that I've got this fever
I can't be kneeling at anyone's feet-
It's a policy of power!
We used to get so deep so easily,
Now I'm drowning in my own echoes!

No more invitations, I got the hint that you don't want them
I hate that's all we've got between us, only these hints & implications
Say it to me-

Hmm, its like I'm trying to fight a mirror
Trying to reach out from a dream
And I'm deflected by your figure
I get so high on anxiety
Chasing riddles with no answers-
We used to get so deep so easily,
Now you only want to flex your power!

No more invitations, I got the hint that you don't want them
I hate that's all we've got between us, only these hints & implications
Say it to me loud-
Just want to break the screen somehow
Without the same information,
We're living in two separate dimensions
So break it to me-

Can't give this one more night
I'm risking all my light
If we live or die,
I won't beg like a child

Thought it was sweet to have nothing to hide
But every time I speak, it's a suicide!

No more invitations, I got the hint that you don't want them
I hate that's all we've got between us, only these hints & implications
No more invitations, I got the hint that you don't want them
I hate that's all we've got between us, only these hints & implications
(I'm caught up, I'm caught up, in needing the truth,
But there's no more, there's no more, believing in you
I'm caught up, I'm caught up, in needing the truth,
But there's no more, there's no more, needing you)
