Where the sun always sits low
Tide always high
Where the stars stay with the moon
Always in the sky
Down a road where you live
With all of the people you've ever loved
And they dance and sing and smile
When you arrive
And they say

I've been waiting for you
Since the day you were born
Thousands of years ago
Hope it makes you feel at
I've been waiting for you
Since the day you were born
Thousands of years ago
Hope it makes you feel at home
Hope it makes you feel at home
Hope it makes you feel at

Where the sea always feels warm
All the way down
There's no days, no weeks, no months
No years to go wrong
No such thing as a child, a woman or man
Just the voices of souls that we've lost
To meet you again
And they say

I've been waiting for you
Since the day you were born
Thousands of years ago
Hope it makes you feel at
I've been waiting for you
Since the day you were born
Thousands of years ago
Hope it makes you feel at home
Hope it makes you feel at home
Hope it makes you feel at
