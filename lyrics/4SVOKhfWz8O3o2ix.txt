I wanna write you a song
One as beautiful as you are sweet
Just a hint of pain for the feeling
That I get when you are gone
I wanna write you a song

I wanna lend you my coat
One that's as soft as your cheek
So when the world is cold
You will have a hiding place you can go
I wanna lend you my coat

Oooh
Everything I need I get from you
Oooh, ooh
You give it back 'cause I want it too

I wanna build you a boat
One as strong as you are free
So anytime you think that your heart is gonna sink
You know it won't
I wanna build you a boat

Oooh
Everything I need I get from you
Oooh, ooh
Giving back is all I wanna do
Oooh

Oooh
Everything I need I get from you
Oooh, ooh
Giving back is all I wanna do

I wanna write you a song
One to make your heart remember me
So anytime I'm gone you can listen to my voice and sing along
I wanna write you a song
