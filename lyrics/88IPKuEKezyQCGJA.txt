There's something in the look you give
I can't help myself I fall, I can't help myself at all
There's something in your touch when we kiss
I scream god forgive me please because I want you on your knees
But I don't wanna think of about it now
I know I won't get out if I fall in
So I don't want to think about it now
It's dark in my imagination, it's dark in my imagination

There's something in the look you give
Now are you giving it to her cause I'm not entirely sure
Can't help but wonder where you've been all day
Just say when I'm so far away
That you give yourself a taste
Cause I don't want to think about it now
I know I won't get out if I fall in
So I don't want to think about it now
It's dark in my imagination, it's dark in my imagination
dark in my imagination, dark in my imagination
I don't want to think about it now
Is it all in my head? Are you somewhere waiting for me?
I don't want to think about it now
Is there something unsaid? Are there secrets that you keep?
But I don't want to think about it now x3
It's dark in my imagination x 11
I don't want to think about it now x 11
IT'S DARK IN MY IMAGINATION
