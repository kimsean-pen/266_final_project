Hey, do you remember when you told me, you were feeling lonely?
Funny how that works.
You love playing secrets.
Cause you could never keep them.
You're no good.
No, you're no good.
I lay awake by myself.
It's when my mind gets stuck on you.
And you can't relate to the way it feels, can you?
You're no good for me, girl.

Sick of telling you that Your heart races so fast now.
Thinking about his fingertips against your skin.
And you love the rush of your lips on his.
And baby I'm not the least surprised by it.
And that's worse to me girl.

Were just stuck playing in a game, no motion.
I don't understand what I did to deserve it.

And I try, to forget how you haunt me.
