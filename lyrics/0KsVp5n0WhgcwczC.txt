I've been trying to make sense
I've been shouting under my breath
How's any of this in my interest?
When you sold me out
I must've not got the cheque

Your lust is a lie but it comes as no suprise
Time after time you coast right past the line
I do my best to,
To make amends with you
But I just can't see the end

Don't hold your breath
I'm not losing sleep over you
I'm Mr Reckless with a capital R

Don't hold your breath
I'm not losing sleep over you
I'm Mr Reckless and you're defenseless

Isn't it funny how
Those black clouds follow you around?
It's karma smiling down
Just let me know when it's in town

You act like the world owes you a favour
You want it all but you don't like the taste oh
You've been throwing bricks at my window
Like there's no better way to say 'hello'
Hello

Don't hold your breath
I'm not losing sleep over you
I'm Mr Reckless with a capital R

Don't hold your breath
I'm not losing sleep over you
I'm Mr Reckless and you're defenseless

The best you never had
The best you never had
The best you never had
The best you never had

I'm the devil on your shoulder
I'm the conscious in your mind

I'm the feeling that you
You cannot hide

I'm the devil on your shoulder
Telling you that love is blind
It's ok when it's hiding in disguise

Your loose lips let
Let words slide
You spend too much
Time talking about my life

Stories you will spin
Just for a power trip
It's safe to say that I am not into it

In the picture you are not
Someone else is in your spit
This is the result of people moving on

Good luck with killing time
You won't be killing mine
I'll do my best to always be on your mind

I never once said I didn't mean this
I can't wait to see how this one pans out

You are the first to question my achievemnets
But that's alright
My dreams I've been living

Don't hold your breath
I'm not losing sleep over you
I'm Mr Reckless with a capital R

Don't hold your breath
I'm not losing sleep over you
I'm Mr Reckless with a capital R

Don't hold your breath
I'm not losing sleep over you
I'm Mr Reckless and you're defenseless

The best you never had
The best you never had
The best you never had
The best you never had
