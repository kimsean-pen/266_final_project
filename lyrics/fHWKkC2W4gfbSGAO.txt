See the fire, watch it grow
Even when I've got my eyes closed, oh
Seeping deep into me
I can feel you breathing in my bones

And I follow blind
Through a tunnel mind we meet
And it's burning bright
And I feel it cry for me

Reaching out for the northern lights
Leave it all behind
Reaching up for the neon sky
Now our stars align

And everything we touch turns to gold
Never ever let go
Cause everything we touch turns to gold
So never ever let go

Colour in, colour out
See my breath and feel the ice-white heat
Pick me up, slam me down
Cause my heart is hitting every beat

And I follow blind
Through a tunnel mind we meet
And it's burning bright
And I feel it cry for me

Reaching out for the northern lights
Leave it all behind
And everything we touch turns to gold
Never ever let go
Cause everything we touch turns to gold
So never ever let go
