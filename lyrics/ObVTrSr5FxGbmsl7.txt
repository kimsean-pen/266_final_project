Hey let's party, let's get down
Let's turn the radio on, this is the meltdown
Get out the camera, take a picture
Drag queens and the freaks are all out on the town
And cowboy Jim's in bed
Nursing a swollen head

Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustanov
Don't like the scene anyhow
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the fuss was about
Now there goes the neighborhood

The photo chick made to look sickly
Is standing in her panties in the shower
She plays the guitar in the bathroom
While the police dust her mother's plastic flowers
And Schoolboy John's in jail
Making a killing through the U.S. Mail

Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustanov
Don't like the scene anyhow
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the fuss was about
Now there goes the neighborhood...
Neighborhood...
Well there goes the neighborhood

This is the movie of a screenplay
Of a book about a girl who meets a junkie
Messenger gets shot down
Just for carrying the message to her flunkie
We can't be certain who the villains are
'Cause everyone's so pretty
But the after-party's sure to be a wing-ding
As it moves into your city, oh...

Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustanov
Don't like the scene anyhow
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the stink was about

Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustanov
Don't like the scene anyhow
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the fuss was about
Now there goes the neighborhood...
Hood...
Now there goes the neighborhood

There goes the neighborhood
