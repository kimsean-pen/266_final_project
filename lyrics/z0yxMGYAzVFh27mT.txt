Baby I've been thinking
Been in this thing too long
I wanna be through
I'm sick and tired of you

And lately I've been thinking
Just because your money's strong
Don't mean you can do
The things that you do

Just so you know I did everything
In case you don't, let me tell you this
I'm tired of spending all my time
And waiting on your dime
And get lovin' half the time
I'd rather be broke than with you, you, you...
I'd rather be broke than with you, you, you...

Baby I've been thinking
How you've treated me so wrong
I put up with you
And that ain't gon do

And baby I've been thinking
That I'm better off alone
It's long overdue
I won't be the fool

Just so you know I did everything
In case you don't, let me tell you this
I'm tired of spending all my time
And waiting on your dime
And get lovin' half the time
I'd rather be broke than with you, you, you...
I'd rather be broke than with you, you, you...
I gave you chances
Too many chances
But you went too far
You went and broke my heart

I gave you chances
Too many chances
But you went too far
You went and broke my heart

I'd rather be broke than with you, you, you...
I'd rather be broke than with you, you, you...
I'd rather be broke than with you, you, you...
I'd rather be broke than with you, you, you...

I gave you chances
Too many chances
But you went too far
You went and broke my heart
