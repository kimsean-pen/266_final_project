Angels fall to the floor
Like they would if I was captain
"Silver children," She roared
"I'm not the son of God"
Somebody help me sing
Can anybody hear me?
Liars and lovers combine tonight
We're gonna make a scene

Somebody help me sing
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Somebody help me sing
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Help me be captain of
Our crippled disguises
I won't show what's underneath
It's time for surprises
I can't climb up your ladder
I can't ride your horse
I've swallowed half an hourglass
So now the landscape has swollen up

I gave birth to a fire
It's like his features were burning
I'm in control
I am the son of God
Somebody help me sing
Can anybody hear me?
Line up your soldiers one final time
We're gonna have a ball

Somebody help me sing
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Somebody help me sing
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Help me be captain of
Our crippled disguises
I won't show what's underneath
It's time for surprises
I can't climb up your ladder
I can't ride your horse
I've swallowed half an hourglass
So now the landscape has swollen up

Let's love death away
Let's love death away
Let's love death away
Let's love death away
Let's love death away
Let's love death away
Let's love death away
Let's love death away
