Only an angel can feed
On ashes and ovaries
Blame the pagans and saints
They are one

War, wisdom and rhyme
The peach and the rattlesnake

We are grave
We are graves
We will die

Maybe the sawgrass did feel
Burnt confederate steel
Spoilt milk on the grave
We were wrong

War, wisdom and rhyme
The catfish and bayonet

We are grave
We are graves
We will die

Grave fire
War, wisdom and rhyme

We will...
