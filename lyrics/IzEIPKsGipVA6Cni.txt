Dream, you can dream, you can dream, you can dream
I know you can dream

It's not right to dream at night
It's not right
If everyone fights to dream at night
It's not right
When you write
If everyone fights to dream at night
It's not right
That bedroom is white
When you write
If everyone fights to dream at night

Everybody dance ev'rybody
Everybody dance ev'rybody all the night and get surprised
Showing a show on a back floor
Oh overflow

Wonder where the magic hides
Wonder where the magic hides

And when you try to get into the inkling
Why would you turn a shadow into a show?
And when you try to open windows alone
That shadow don't stop window, only chance
That shadow tries the window, only nice

Dream, you can dream, you can dream, you can dream
I know you can dream

Things aren't as bad as they seem
Things aren't as bad as they seem
Dream, you can dream, you can dream, you can dream
I know you can dream
Things aren't as bad as they seem
Things aren't as bad as they seem
Dream, you can dream, you can dream, you can dream
I know you can dream
Things aren't as bad as they seem
Things aren't as bad as they seem
Dream, you can dream, you can dream, you can dream
I know you can dream
Things aren't as bad as they seem
Things aren't as bad as they seem
Dream, you can dream, you can dream, you can dream...
