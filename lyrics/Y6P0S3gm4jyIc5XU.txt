I'm just a child trying to be a woman
And you
Ahh you are a strange one
Tryin
To be my man
Ahh lying here so close to me tryin
I love you I love you I love you
But it's so hard for me to be me
I wish I could give to you
I'd be free I'd be free I'd be free
Ahh then I could be me
I'm just a child trying to be a woman
And you
Ahh you are a strange one trying to be
my friend
Ahh lyin here telling me what you feel tryin
I need you I need you I need you
But it's so hard for me to be me
I wish I could live for you
I'd be free I'd be free I'd be free
Ahh then I could be me
I'm just a child trying to be a woman
And you
You are a strange one
Trying not to be a child.
