The way
You look at me
When you think
I'm not looking
Tells me your heart's
A sleeping giant
Worn out
By someone
You loved before me
I see you're scared
Unconvinced by
What I've tried to say
That I am yours
And that nothing
Will take me away

You already know
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe
And nothing
Will take me away
I know that you know
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe
And nothing
Will take me away

The way
You always call me
With some question
And every time
Try to pretend
You didn't call me
Just cos
I was on your mind
Too soon for you
To say out loud
But I know
You love me
And though
We don't say it
Already shows

You already know
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe
And nothing
Will take me away
I know that you know
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe
And nothing
Will take me away
You already know
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe
And nothing
Will take me away
You already know
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe
And nothing
Will take me away

I wait for you
To open up
But it's not a bore
You're just
What I've been
Looking for
Why do you keep
Your head in the sand?
Whoever
You loved before me
That ran's
Nothing like me
Nothing like me
Nothing like me

You already know
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe
And nothing
Will take me away
I know that you know
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe
And nothing
Will take me away
You already know
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe
And nothing
Will take me away
I know that you know
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe
And nothing
Will take me away

The way you look at me
When you think
I'm not looking
The way you call me up
Just to see
What's cooking
The way you look at me
When you think
I'm not looking
I look at you
That way too
You just don't know
That I do

I know that you know
You already know
