I can run, I can race for hours
And hours and don't stop
I can float
I can fly us to the highest mountain tops

I can breathe you, I can drink in your laugh
I can, l can live on your smile
I can trip and if I can fall into your arms
I can stay there my whole life

I can live, I can love, I can be better with you
For real
I can hear, I can feel, I can see, I can tell
You are for real

I can live, I can love, I can be better with you
For real
I can hear, I can feel, I can see, I can tell
You are for real

I can stare, I can memorize your face
Your hands, your hair
Every part of you
I can cut off any of loose ends and not even wanna keep a few

I can speak to you so honestly
I can't even run any game
I can hear a million angels singing in my ears
When I say your name

I can live, I can love, I can be better with you
For real
I can hear, I can feel, I can see, I can tell
You are for real

I can live, I can love, I can be better with you
For real
I can hear, I can feel, I can see, I can tell
You are for real

I can't smile, can't dream like a child
Can't feel safe in this wide world without you
I can't go, can't disturb this flow
Can't begin to know what I would do

I can't see, can't find strength to be
Rather not be me without you
I can't deal, I can't even feel
Without you I'm not real

I can live, I can love, I can be better with you
For real
I can hear, I can feel, I can see, I can tell
You are for real

I can live, I can love, I can be better with you
For real
I can hear, I can feel, I can see, I can tell
You are for real

I can live, I can love, I can be better with you
For real
I can hear, I can feel, I can see, I can tell
You are for real

I can live, I can love, I can be better with you
For real
I can hear, I can feel, I can see, I can tell
You are for real
