I hope that he will be safe
Hopefully return in April
I've heard the winds speak of a fight
And it hit my heart like a thorn
Whispering voices appear
I can't escape what I feel
All I can see, all I believe in
Is connected to our kindred souls
I feel the thorn
- I feel the thorn
In my flesh
The pounding of blood, in my head
I cry aloud, I cry of anger
My enemy
- Your enemy
will never forget me
I heard you calling my name
I saw your colourless face
Fire in your eyes, where do you go to?
I dreamt of an enemy threatening you
I feel the thorn
- I feel the thorn
In my flesh
The pounding of blood, in my head
I cry aloud, I cry of anger
My enemy
- Your enemy
Will never forget me
I feel the thorn
- I feel the thorn
In your flesh
The pounding of blood, in your head
You cry aloud
- I cry
Your cry of anger
Your enemy
- Enemy
Will never forget you
Hold me
Breathe with me
Until the end of time
I feel the thorn
- I feel the thorn
In my flesh
The pounding of blood, in my head
I cry aloud, I cry of anger
My enemy
- Your enemy
Will never forget me
I feel the thorn
- I feel the thorn
In your flesh
The pounding of blood, in your head
You cry aloud
- I cry
Your cry of anger
Your enemy
- Enemy
Will never forget you
