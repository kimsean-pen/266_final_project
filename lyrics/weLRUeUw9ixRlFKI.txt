Overtired/overthink,
Club nights and cheap drinks,
Do you ever think of me the way I think about you?
Lately I'm on the brink,
I stand up and slowly sink,
Into the pavement below,
And if I ever die I'll have someone let you know,

It was all your fault.

Hiding with the boys in your bedroom,
Hiding the evidence of dying youth,
Under cigarettes and stale perfume.

Approaching midnight,
In teenage twilight,
Black hair and skinny jeans,
Alert your parent's porch light.
Oh, when we met last spring,
We had such a pretty thing,
We fade like a Polaroid,
I'm all things you were taught to avoid,

I'm clothes you never wear,
I'm yours but you don't care.

Hiding with the boys in your bedroom,
Hiding the evidence of dying youth,
Under cigarettes and stale perfume.

Hiding with the boys in your bedroom,
Hiding the evidence of dying youth,
Under cigarettes and stale perfume.

In your bedroom,
In your bedroom,
In your bedroom.

Lie on your bed, lie through your teeth.
(Loving you is killing me, loving you is killing me)
Lie on your bed, lie to me.
(Loving you is killing me, loving you is killing me)
Lie on your bed, lie through your teeth.
(Loving you is killing me, loving you is killing me)
Lie on your bed, lie to me.
(Loving you is killing me, loving you is killing me)

Hiding with the boys in your bedroom,
Hiding the evidence of dying youth,
Under cigarettes and stale perfume.

Hiding with the boys in your bedroom,
Hiding the evidence of dying youth,
Under cigarettes and stale perfume.

(Loving you is killing me, loving you is killing me)
