Haven't thought of a new word to say in so long,
Wouldn't know what to do with it,
So I'll use the same old goodbyes and move on,
Or at least move away.

Wasn't the right thing to say at the time, I know,
But then what else could I do?
It's not the right way to be I know,
But then some things never change about you.

What is this strange thing you're pushing my way?
I don't know what to do with it.
Looks like it's trying to be gentle
But it broke my heart and so I'll just give it back.

Wasn't the right thing to say I know
But then what else could I do?
And it's not the right way to be I know,
But then some things never change about you.

Wasn't the right thing to say at the time I know,
And it's not the right way to be I know
But then what are you gonna do?
Haven't thought of a new word to say in so long
I wouldn't know what to do with it.

Haven't thought of a new word to say in so long,
Wouldn't know what to do with it
I wouldn't know what to do with it
I wouldn't know what to do with it
