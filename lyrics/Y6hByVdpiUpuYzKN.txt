As a kid my hands were red
When you asked me I denied it
I've told lies that never came true
And I have stolen and so have you

If we can make it through another day
With you believing in my innocence
Then we can make it through another year
'Cause we both needed to forget this fear
If it's all the same to you
And it's just a little white lie
Then it's all the same to me
And it's just a little white lie
If I was to blame, would you
Would you still believe?

I don't want you to forget
Just pretend that it never happened
And it's just a little white lie
And it's just a little white lie

If it's all the same to you
And it's just a little white lie
Then it's all the same to me
And it's just a little white lie
If I was to blame, would you
Would you still believe
If I was a thief?
