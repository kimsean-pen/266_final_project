Some nights
Some nights I drink much too much and
I smoke just to feel like I'm in a vibe
Some nights I kill myself just so i can feel like I'm still alive
Just so I can feel like I'm in a moment with you
And I wake up and do it all again I'm forgetfull

Some nights
Some nights I drink way too much and
I smoke just to feel like I'm in a vibe
Some nights I kill myself just so I can feel like I'm still alive
Just so I can feel like I'm in a moment with you
And I wake up and do it all again I'm forgetfull

Who the fuck needs trophies
Money feed the kids nigga, gimme that
I'm not a shooter but I promise I know just how that Semi act
Baby boy, Gucci sneaks and I need my Similac
That steak is medium rare, not rare, send it back, send it back
Friction got us going our separate ways
I promised her forever starting tomorrow knowing that she'd never wait
So if I'm wrong now say that I'm wrong
Let me know
Some nights

Losing your mind the whole time
If you're all mine, then say you're all mine
We've both been blurring the lines, we're so blind
I say we're both trying, you say there's no time
I give you my all, so ain't fucking nothing left
You told me you're leaving,
I told you I ain't gon' cry, so I never wept
And I gamble with my life, so tonight I'm placing heavy bets

Some nights
Some nights I drink way too much and
I smoke just to feel like I'm in a vibe
Some nights I kill myself just so I can feel like I'm still alive
Just so I can feel like I'm in a moment with you
And I wake up and do it all again I'm forgetfull

I can send an Uber for you right now
I can get you here in like 20 minutes
When you come here, we like that
What we gon' talk about, so many things
That's a waste of time
I can't be yours, and you can't be mine
This can not rewind
We can not both be so blind
I overspend on drinks, so you could enjoy yourself
Let's not forget those moments, oh baby let's don't
This shit got me too fucked up right now, pardon me
It's hard to let go of you, 'cause you're a part of me

Some nights
Some nights I drink way too much and
I smoke just to feel like I'm in a vibe
Some nights I kill myself just so I can feel like I'm still alive
Just so I can feel like I'm in a moment with you
And I wake up and do it all again I'm forgetfull
