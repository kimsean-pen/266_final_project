looking out on a familiar scene
there's no agreement in what we see
your perception lacks clarify
and my perspective is blinding me

side by side
divided they stand

parallel lives running parallel with YOU
to the point where our horizons divide
my opinion is just a point of view
and your position is the other side

caught up in our convictions we forget
how our senses distort things we see
we can't accept our differences
but we can always disagree

side by side
divided they stand

parallel lives running parallel with YOU
to the point where our horizons divide
my opinion is just a point of view
and your position is the other side

where I stand is not so far from YOU
a different opinion is just another point of view

parallel lives running parallel with YOU
to the point where our horizons divide
my opinion is just a point of view
and your position is the other side

parallel lives running parallel with YOU
to the point where our horizons divide
my opinion is just a point of view
and your position is the other side

parallel lives running parallel with YOU
to the point where our horizons divide
my opinion is just a point of view
and your position is the other side
