Hungry wolves on the outside
Howling for a chain
Keep on searching, shouting for truth
Hanging on the little lies

They want to change us but it's not right
I think it's our time to show them some light
I keep on chasing the sunrise just before I

Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway,
I know they breathe, I know they're breathing
Runaway, runaway, runaway,
I know they breathe, I know they're breathing
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway

Chasing midnight hours
'Cause we're not afraid
Taste so sweet and sour
Tryna get the best of life

They want to change us but it's not right
I think it's our time to show them some light
I keep on chasing the sunrise just before I

Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway,
I know they breathe, I know they're breathing
Runaway, runaway, runaway,
I know they breathe, I know they're breathing
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I never breathe, I kept on breathing
I never breathe, I kept on breathing

I would like to run with you
Tryna get the best of us
Tryna shine a light with you
Drinking lemon juice and i'm fine
I would like to run with you
Tryna get the best of us
Tryna shine a light with you
Drinking lemon juice and then

They want to change us but it's not right
I think it's our time to show them some light
I keep on chasing the sunrise just before I

Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway,
I know they breathe, I know they're breathing
Runaway, runaway, runaway,
I know they breathe, I know they're breathing
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I never breathe, I kept on breathing
I never breathe, I kept on breathing
