I've pulled us another plan
But it's pulling me into the ground
We'll be together again
But only if you'll play along

You're everything I could ever want
Just save your advice for another girl
One night inside my head
And you're gone, you're gone, you're gone
Two years without a word
And you're gone, you're gone, you're really gone

I'd never thought you'd be
The one afraid of me
I would've set you free eventually
And now you're out of sight
I hope you feel alright
'Cause you're gone, you're gone, you're really gone

I'll never regret a thing
'Cause my mind is already too gone
Sleep well, without a care
I'll only catch you in your dreams

You're everything I could ever want
Just save your advice for another girl
One night inside my head
And you're gone, you're gone, you're gone
Two years without a word
And you're gone, you're gone, you're really gone

I'd never thought you'd be
The one afraid of me
I would've set you free eventually
And now you're out of sight
I hope you feel alright
'Cause you're gone, you're gone, you're really gone

(You're gone, you're gone, you're gone)
('Cause you're gone, you're gone, you're really gone)

You're everything I could ever want
Just save your advice for another girl
One night inside my head
And you're gone, you're gone, you're gone
Two years without a word
And you're gone, you're gone, you're really gone

I'd never thought you'd be
The one afraid of me
I would've set you free eventually
And now you're out of sight
I hope you feel alright
'Cause you're gone, you're gone, you're really gone

'Cause you're gone, you're gone, you're gone
'Cause you're gone, you're gone, you're really gone x2
'Cause you're gone, you're gone, you're gone
('Cause you're gone, you're gone, you're gone)
'Cause you're gone, you're gone, you're gone
