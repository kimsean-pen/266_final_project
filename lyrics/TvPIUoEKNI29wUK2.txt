The way I broke your heart very literally
This ghost haunts me more than it should be
I'm not gonna walk away or turn my head in shame
I never thought it could kill me

A clean slate, one more day further away

I want you, you don't want me
My mistake for wasting yours and mine
I want you, but will you stay
With me today?
With me today?

Just let me make some time to take it back a little
The way you smile shines the heavens above me (heavens above me)
Never going to let you go, I want you all the time
I gotta prove you can trust me

A clean slate, one more day further away

I want you, you don't want me
My mistake for wasting yours and mine
I want you, but will you stay
With me today?
With me today?

I need you, you don't need me
When you are low, I am not okay
I want you, but will you stay
With me today?
With me today?
With me today?
With me today?

A clean slate, one more day further away, yeah

I want you, you don't want me
My mistake for wasting yours and mine
I want you, but will you stay
With me today?
With me today?

I need you, 'cause you need me
When you are low, I am not okay
I want you, but will you stay
With me today?
With me today?
With me today?
With me today?
