From the cradle to the floor
My flesh and my bones
Is that the way it's supposed to be
How the story goes
Ribbons and bones
Like a thorn on a rose
When the one man who gave it all to you
Has to let you go

He found for me scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for my hair

What becomes of a father's love
When another has his daughter's love
Don't you know they'll never be here but
I'll always be your little girl

It's all borrowed time
And you always said I would regret it
If I grew up to fast
But my heart is strong and true
I'm doing fine
The things that you said
I won't forget them
I'll do as you ask
And always play fair for you

You found for me scarlet ribbons
Those scarlet ribbons for my hair

What becomes of a father's love
When another has his daughter's love
Don't you know they'll never be here but
I'll always be your little girl

There's a part of you
In every part of me (should know better)
Maybe you should know
I won't let that go
As long as I can cry on your shoulder
Won't be growing up
Just older
You have got to let me go

You found for me scarlet ribbons
Those scarlet ribbons for my hair

What becomes of a father's love
When another has his daughter's love
Don't you know they'll never be here but
I'll always be your little girl

I'll always be, always be your little girl
Always be, always be your little girl
Always be, always be your little girl
Always be your little girl

You have got to let it go, oh oh
You have got to let it go

You have got to let it go, oh
You have got to let it go
You have got to let it go, oh oh
You have got to let it go
