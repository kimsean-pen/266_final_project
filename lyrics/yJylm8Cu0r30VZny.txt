I looked over the garden wall, past
A whole circus of cellphone calls
To where you found me
Run weary and out of practice
High, strung in a basement bar
You came out with us

I still remember the clothes you wore
And your southern gaze
Your eyes so slow but you know
I don't even care
I don't wanna know
If I'm here you're there
And I miss you so

I admit
I double back when I told you
"I don't write love songs"
I can hear your accent and darling it kills me
That our time is all gone
I still remember the walk we took
And the bouquet on the subway platform

But I don't even care
I don't wanna know
How you changed your hair
Where this letter goes
I don't even care
I don't wanna know
I can't stand the part of letting go

La, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
La, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
La, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
La, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
