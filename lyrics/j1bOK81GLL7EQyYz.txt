Down in Reseda where I left my keys
You picked them up and stepped right in
I had a vision about this very thing
But it's probably in my head

From now on, from now on
from now on I'm gonna be your friend

Your inner compass says you know I'm right
No more letters, just a will.
All the prophets on the mountaintop.
But no one's hanging on the hill

From now on, from now on,
from now on I'm gonna be your friend

From now on, from now on,
from now on I'm gonna be your friend

Something put you in my way
may the moment awake in your head
Fall in to the what is
Let your body do all the rest
May a love never break you
May a love never break you
Keep your heart on your sleeve now
don't let anyone else tell you different

From now on, from now on,
from now on I'm gonna be your friend

From now on, from now on,
from now on I'm gonna be your friend
