Somebody's looking for a situation
Somebody's working on the score
I wrestle nightly for some instigation
Circles running round come back for more
Somebody needs a little more everyday
Somebody needs a little give
I'm gonna line it up, get on the way
And take it there again

Hey, wait a minute, just a minute, I was ready for the flight
Got my bags packed waiting on the driver curve
So just a minute, take a minute for the change-up
I'm all set to go, set to go

And now I'm all you're waiting for
I'm all you're waiting for

Somebody's looking for a situation
Somebody's working on the score
If I never got the invitation
Would I ever see the exit door?
Somebody needs a little more everyday
Somebody needs a little give
I'm gonna line it up, get on the way
And take it there again

Hey, wait a minute, just a minute, I was ready for the flight
So just a minute, take a minute for the change-up

Hey, wait a minute, just a minute, I was ready for the flight
Got my bags packed waiting on the driver curve
So just a minute, take a minute for the change-up
I'm all set to go, set to go

And now I'm all you're waiting for
I'm all you're waiting for
And now I'm all you're waiting for
I'm all you're waiting for
