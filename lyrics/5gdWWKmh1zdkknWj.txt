They call her Bulldozer speech demon without distractions of hope
She makes the depression business look surprisingly novel
And she's not just royal Allegedly loyal
But unfaithful but she has no faith in me
Inhale the damage smoothly Paradise isn't lost
It was hiding all along

There's the ones that you love
The ones that love you
The ones that make you come
The ones that make you come unglued

I can't turn my back on you
When you are walking away

Bottomless celebrity scar staged circuses for schoolgirls
boys are all dressed up like a mediocre suicide omen
here comes the red carpet grave again and again and again
Oh man

There's the ones that you love
The ones that love you
The ones that make you come
The ones that make you come unglued

I can't turn my back on you
When you are walking away
I can't turn my back on you
When you are walking away
Can't turn my back on you
When you are walking away

There's the ones that you love
The ones that love you
The ones that make you come
The ones that make you come unglued

There's the ones that you love
The ones that love you
The ones that make you come
The ones that make you come unglued

It's easy to beat the system
But a hard time beating the symptoms
But a hard time beating the symptoms

I can't turn my back on you
I can't turn my back on you
I can't turn my back on you
When you are walking away

Here comes the red carpet grave
Again and again and again

Here comes the red carpet grave
Again and again and again
Oh man
