If you need a friend
Don't look to a stranger
You know in the end
I'll always be there

But when you're in doubt
And when you're in danger
Take a look all around
And I'll be there

I'm sorry but I'm just thinking
Of the right words to say
I know they don't sound
The way I planned them to be
But if you wait around a while,
I'll make you fall for me
I promise, I promise you I will

When your day is through
And so is your temper
You know what to do
I'm gonna always be there

Sometimes if I shout
It's not what's intended
These words just come out
With no cross to bear

I'm sorry but I'm just thinking
Of the right words to say
I know they don't sound
The way I planned them to be
But if you wait around a while,
I'll make you fall for me
I promise, I promise you I will

I'm sorry but I'm just thinking
Of the right words to say
I know they don't sound
The way I planned them to be
In fact, as you walk the world
I'd make you fall for me
I promise you, I promise you I will

I will, I will, I will
Yeah

Gotta tell ya (gotta tell ya)
I need to tell ya (I need to tell ya)
Gotta tell ya (gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)

I'm sorry but I'm just thinking
Of the right words to say
I know they don't sound
The way I planned them to be
But if you wait around a while,
I'll make you fall for me
I promise you, I promise you I will

I'm sorry but I'm just thinking
Of the right words to say
I know they don't sound
The way I planned them to be
In fact, as you walk the world
I'd make you fall for me
I promise you, I promise you I will

I will, I will
