The pretty-haired girl in the cardigan
Oh I hope you don't mind if I try hard again
To get you back to where we've been
Ever since in the car I've been
Ever since in the car I've been
Cursing every street sign for Hollister Avenue
And closing my eyes for yellow bugs and every Chevy Malibu
And I am sick of driving by 810 Fulton every night
Just another stupid place that puts you right back in my mind
And that's alright
And even if this city taunts me all my life
At least I know that I still tried
Just keep telling myself this was not not not not quite right
But I beg to differ
And every single time I'm with her
I swear that I could perfectly fit her
And I swear there is something in her
And it ties us and connects us through all the backyards and their fences

And I just hope it didn't snap underneath me and all my tension.

I'm done eating sriracha and ordering Chinese food
Cus those are just two more stupid things that remind me how much I need you
And I'm done at the meanwhile and I am done at the thrift store
Two more stupid things that remind me what I miss more than anything
And you know me girl and you know I've lost many things
But none of them thus far has ever felt so close to losing everything
