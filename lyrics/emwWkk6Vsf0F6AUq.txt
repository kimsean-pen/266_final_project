Why do I say, don't walk away?
You'll be the way you were before
When you don't want me anymore

Don't turn around
Don't ever leave a lonely room where empty days
Are gathering to meet me when you're gone, gone
How in the world will I go on?

(Don't walk away)
All you gotta do is stay
(Don't walk away)
All you gotta do is stay
(Don't walk away)

Don't walk away, don't say goodbye
Don't turn around, don't let it die
When shadows fall, when day is done
All through the night, all of my life
Don't walk away

Is it a dream, when will it end?
When everything we've ever known
Has ended and I'm all alone

Where will I go, where will I be?
The feelings that I've never shown
Maybe I'll find the answer when you're gone, gone
How in the world will I go on?

(Don't walk away)
All you gotta do is stay
(Don't walk away)
All you gotta do is stay
(Don't walk away)

Don't walk away, don't say goodbye
Don't turn around, don't let it die
When shadows fall, when day is done
All through the night, all of my life
(Don't walk away)

Don't walk away, don't say goodbye
Don't turn around, don't let it die
When shadows fall, when day is done
All through the night, all of my life

Don't walk away, don't say goodbye
Don't turn around, don't let it die
When shadows fall, when day is done
All through the night, all of my life
Don't walk away
