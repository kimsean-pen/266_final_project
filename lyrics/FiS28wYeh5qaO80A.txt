I get a thrill, thrill, thrill --
Thrill at you from my head down to my toes
She make me feel so good all night long
Really rock till I'm almost gone
Get a thrill, thrill, thrill --
Thrill at you from my head down to my toes
Oh baby, make me feel so good
She hold me - oh, drive me mad
Do the little things you do
I thrill at you from my head down to my toes

She got me crazy, on my knees
My baby meets my needs
She keep moanin', moanin' - don't stop now
Gotta have love - ooh, wow
Get a thrill, thrill, from my head down to my toes
She treat me tender - arms open wide
Sits around with her lips to mine
I get a thrill, thrill, thrill --
I thrill at you from my head down to my toes
I get a thrill, thrill, thrill --
Chill, chill, chill --
