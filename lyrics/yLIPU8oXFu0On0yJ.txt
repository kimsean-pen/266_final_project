Come home early after class
Don't be hangin round the back of the schoolyard
I've been called up by your teacher
She says she can't even reach you cause you're so far

You've been talking with your fists
We didn't raise you up like this, now did we?
There've been changes in this house
Things you don't know about in this family

It don't make sense, but nevertheless
You gotta believe us, it's all for the best
It don't make sense, the way things go
Son you should know

Sometimes mums and dads fall out of love
Sometimes two homes are better than one
Some things you can't tell your sister cause she's still too young
Yeah you'll understand
When You Love Someone

There ain't no one here to blame
and nothing's gonna change with your old friends
Your room will stay the same cause you'll only be away on the weekends
It don't make sense but nevertheless
You gotta believe us, it's all for the best
It don't make sense, it don't add up
But we'll always love you no matter what

Sometimes mums and dads fall out of love
Sometimes two homes are better than one
Some things you can't tell your sister cause she's still too young
Yeah you'll understand
When You Love Someone
When You Love Someone

Come home early after class
Don't be hangin round the back of the schoolyard
And if we're crying on the couch
Don't let it freak you out cause it's been so hard

Sometimes mums and dads fall out of love
Sometimes the best intentions just ain't enough
Some things you can't tell your sister cause she's still too young
Yeah you'll understand
When You Love Someone
When You Love Someone
When You Love Someone
When You Love Someone
