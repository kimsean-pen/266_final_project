Stop telling me everything
I don't know what are you saying
Keep talkin' and talking that
But It's shit
And don't play stupid with me
I don't even understand
So Please Would you walk away
I mean it
You do your way
I'll do on my way
Just give my day
I don't rush always
Baby If you don't like me
Or If you just love me or hate me
You do your way
I'll do on my way
Just give my day
I don't rush always
Baby If you don't like me
Or If you just love me or hate me
I don't give a I don't give a
I don't give fuck about them
I don't give a I don't give a
I don't give fuck about them
I don't give a I don't give a
I don't give fuck about them
I don't give a I don't give a
I don't give fuck about them
I don't give a I don't give a
