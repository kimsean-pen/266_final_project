(oh crashing airplane, where were you the day she left?)

underneath the laughs there lies a need
that nobody is getting.
and an honesty that doesn't stretch far enough
to show us all how much this will mean to us, my dear.
and when we're old we'll tell ourselves that we did
everything that we could to save this.
but now--we do nothing.

i've slept for twenty years, but i've acted strong at least
if you're leaving again, then you're leaving again
and you're gone.
and i feel nothing anymore, so just keep walking away
thirty-thousand steps,
i'll watch you for every second and never feel alone.

i've been sleeping
for at least the last two years
my dear, my princess, my sister, my lover, my friend.
i made you a bed of thorns for every rose you ever left outside my door,
that's all you ever left me.

lay your scars out in rows,
lay your scars out in rows,
lay your scars out in rows
to show me what i've done to you.

lay your scars out in rows,
lay your scars out in rows,
it was my weakness that couldn't save us.

so lay your scars out in rows,
so lay your scars out in rows,
so lay your scars out in rows for me.

we were one, and what are we now?

(act strong, at least
and don't turn around.
if i'm leaving, then i'm leaving, and i'm leaving, and i'm
gone.)

we move as one.
