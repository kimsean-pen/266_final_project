I'm a ghost when I walk in
Holy spirit when I walk out
You want that fame, you can have that fame
Disappearing when the light's out
Chasing money got me feelin' funny (Ooh)
We just want that real shit (Ooh)
All those pictures on the internet (Ooh)
Burn 'em up like a cigarette
(Ooh) We just want that real shit
(Ooh) We just want that real
(Ooh) Now you just a memory
(Ooh) Sippin' on that Tennessee
Sippin' on that Tennessee
Sippin' on that Tennessee
Sippin' on that Tennessee
Want that feeling when you can't breathe
I like the color red, so I let it bleed
Something pretty 'bout the pain, so real
It's like a game to me, It's like a game to me
(Ooh) We just want that real shit
(Ooh) We just want that real
(Ooh) Now you just a memory
(Ooh) Sippin' on that Tennessee
Sippin' on that Tennessee
Sippin' on that Tennessee
(Do it!)
Sippin' on that Tennessee
Do you
Remember when
They bowed to us like kings, my friend? Ohhh
We were the champions
We were the champions
Hey now
Even when
Castles half-blown to the wind
I know they talk about us now and then
Saying we were the champions
We were the champions
Sippin' on that Tennessee
Do it!
Sippin' on that Tennessee
Sippin' on that Tennessee
