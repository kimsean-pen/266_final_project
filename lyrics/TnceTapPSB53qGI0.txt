No stopppin' as we're in the zone
Red hot

In it to win it, girls let's go
Step up
It's time to work it
Step out
Gotta do it for real
Say it loud
It's time to dance
Step up and shine the way you feel
Step up
It's now or never (never)
Step out

Say it loud
Right here together
Time for us to show the world
Oh.
Show 'em what we're workin' with
We got to let them know
Let's turn
Away
From the mirror

It's time to play

Our rules
Our game
We know we've got just what it takes
We've come
This far
Sometimes
It might be hard
We know we are
Each one of us a superstar
Step up
It's time to work it
Step out
Gotta do it for real
Say it loud
It's time to dance

Step up and shine the way you feel

Step up
It's now or never
Step out
Of the Cheetah Girls
Say it loud
Right here together
Time for us to show the world
We believe it 'cause we know we can
Reach any dream, now we understand
There's no givin' up or givin' in
5, 6, 7, 8
