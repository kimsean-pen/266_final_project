I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run Iike pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm cryin'

Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation t-shirt
Stupid bloody Tuesday
Man you been naughty boy
You let your face grow long

I am the eggman
We are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob

Mister city policeman sitting pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky
See how they run
I'm cryin'

I'm cry
I'm cryin'
I'm cry

Yellow matter custard
Drippin' from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife
Pornographic priestess
Man you been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down

I am the eggman
We are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob
Goo goo g'joob

Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come you get a tan from standing in the English rain

'Cause I am the eggman
We are the eggmen
And I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob
Goo goo g'joob

Expert textpert choking smokers
don't you think the joker laughs at you
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snied
I'm cryin'

Semolina pilchards
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man you should have seen them kickin' Edgar Allan Poe

I am the eggman
We are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob
Goo goo g'joob

Goo goo g'joob
