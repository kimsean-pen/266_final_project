Will you surrender?
Rest, wasted and warm, warm
We're sailing, farewell, love
We praise our shared destiny
Be sure to embrace the dreams
I'm more than a dead and gone

(Children, reach out)
(Close your eyes)

I see the past
Of the time passing fast
The present's over and gone
So now I'm ready
I trust my soul
I'm hoping to fly
With style, we shall now

Trust in me
And set me free
You're hiding your love
I don't wish to try this alone
I feel alone, why shouldn't I go?
'Cause even the time we're so longing gets blown
I feel I tried, I feel so alone
One day we'll say it to the glow
I dream so too

(Children, reach out)
(Close your eyes)

When we surrender
Rest, wasted and warm, warm
