I can't forget your smile
When i looked u in the eyes
You're so pretty when u lie
And it's your heat that gets me high
When i'm coming down
You're always hard to find

I don't forget your smile
Your lips in black and white
Suspended in my mind
When i come lookin you're offline
Like makin love
With the movie of your life

Satan watches u, my handsome messiah
Satan watches u, my lantern boy
Satan watches u, my lavender diamond
And i made u cry

It remains on my mind

I don't forget your smile
These days i'm so tired
Just another night to sigh alone
Another reason not to try
Doesn't mean
That i'm any less alive

Satan watches u, my honest dolphin
Seeing how the see was watching god
Satan washes all, all outta my mind
And i made u cry

Another heartbreak fantasy

In the tide
Save your certainty
It's all a game to me
It's only satan's dream
Somehow it's not all lost
Get on satan's team
Someone to carry me
Someone to say to me
It's all been done
For my safety
Oh yeah But it's your fantasy too
Side to side
A lemon and its seed
