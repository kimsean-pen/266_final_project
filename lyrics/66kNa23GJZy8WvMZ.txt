The smell of industrial paint and magnolia
Fill the warm summer night air
We reminisce old meadows
Once full of life
Now they're parking lots
Abandoned shopping carts
Crows picking at discarded wrappers
They were empty and pure

The world hints at our numbered days (Creating a perfect bubble to)
And we revel in it (Be ignorant in)
We've created this crumbling fortress (Taking romance as a drug)
Now we lie our bodies in this filth (It's not only killing me)

Let it take over
Let it take over
