I'm bringing a vest and I run from the past
I pick up the phone just to find I'm alone
It's wearing me out and the weight of my sins
Killed the faith that I had so it's time I begin

Back to this darkness to see how it feels
I was the one that you thought you could heal
Now that it's over it's time to move on
'Cause I was the righteous and you were the wrong

Every time I try to run and hide I feel you're haunting me

I'm addicted to the games that you play
You make me feel so pitiful
Like you're so beautiful
Your heart is beating me to death every day
But I am not that pitiful
You're not that beautiful

I suffer inside just to feel I'm alive
I bury the truth 'cause I know it's a lie
I never said all the things that I should say
'Cause you were the master and I was a slave

If I could find me a drug to forget you
I'd overdose on the day that I met you
Kill all the drama, it's time to move on
'Cause I am the righteous and you were the wrong

Every time I try to run and hide I feel you haunting me

I'm addicted to the games that you play
You make me feel so pitiful
Like you're so beautiful
Your heart is beating me to death every day
But I am not that pitiful
You're not that beautiful

I'm not that pitiful
You're not so beautiful

Every time I look into your eyes I see a demon in disguise
You fucking make me sick, you are the one that I despise
You take me, you break me, you feed me lies
And all thet you gave me in return was my demise
So maybe I'm just crazy for believing this shit
But goddamn I can't believe I'm fucking dealing with this
It's like a nightmare and I can't wake up
I just can't wake up
I'm addicted to the games that you play
You make me feel so pitiful
Like you're so beautiful
Your heart is beating me to death every day
But I am not that pitiful
You're not that beautiful
I'm not that pitiful
You're not so beautiful
