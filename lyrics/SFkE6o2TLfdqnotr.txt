In my life, that's been taken,
I can feel you burn.
In my life, that's been taken,
I can feel you burn.
She lies on the ground
'Til her soul's arised,
Lost in vain, away.
In her hand she holds her luck and
A memory of feelings impress you.

All memories are good
Since you revealed me
The looking of my heart,
For the loss have I complained
Since you left me
All alone.
But these memories are good.
If I think about you,
I can see them
And I like them.
Have I lost them in my life.
How I did you?
Can I die?

Hear me, my love,
Remember me as I was.
Time will come
When we will meet again.
I'm still with you,
In your mind, in your thoughts.
We will meet again, my real love.

Remember all the
Things we've done,
And all the times
We've made love.
Remember the night
When we talked,
And you kissed me,
So we made love
All night.

In my life, that's been taken away,
I feel your heart,
I feel your breath,
Your touch and your kiss.

In my life, that's been taken away,
I feel my love.
I can feel your breath,
Your touch and kiss.

Oh, this love is for real.
Come and touch me here, my dear.
I cannot be without you, my dear.
My way to you,
Forever.
