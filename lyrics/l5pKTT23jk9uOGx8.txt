It's just a fraction of time
Until we move in reverse
Can feel the pressure in all our minds
And the whole Universe

Is it a question of force?
A metaphysical law
We've had this battle a thousand times
Never been here before
Never been here before

Ain't got the strength to fight anymore
Got no desire to die anymore
I need an affirmation

I want to see you again, again, again
Ain't got the strength to fight anymore
Don't even know what I'm fighting for
I need an affirmation

We're at the end of the line
At the start of the race
I want to swim where the water falls
Off the edge of your face

I'm reaching out for the light
Past the silhouette of you
In the cold reflection of time
Is a point of view, is a point of view
Can you see me like I see you?
Can you see me like I see you?

Ain't got the strength to fight anymore
Got no desire to die anymore
I need an affirmation

I want to see you again, again, again
Ain't got the strength to fight anymore
Don't even know what I'm fighting for
I need an affirmation

I wanna fill you with love
I wanna see you survive
Just take a second to know yourself
For the rest of your life
We're just a minute away
From the place that we wanna be

We're not really falling apart
We're just incomplete
We're not really falling apart
We're just incomplete
We're just incomplete
We're just incomplete

I need an affirmation
I need an affirmation
I need an affirmation
I need an affirmation
I wanna see you again
Again, again, again, again
