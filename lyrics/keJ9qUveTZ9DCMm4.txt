this is the greatest place on earth
interstated north and south
i know you won't go far away
three full rooms full night and day
we can't stay here
it's time to go

ten half one two two, st marks place
trust fund, beggars, out in space
how did we get here?
we must leave
information and belief
your time has come
your day is done

show me just one thing
make it real
you can send me anywhere

sing to me

your time has come
your day is done
we can't stay here
we can't stay here
we've been warned into
we've been warned
nailed to the floor
into deep

I am uncertain, it's unclear
east side highway brings us here
i am uncertain its unclear
our time has come, we must leave
one day, one night, turn back, this time

this is the greatest place on earth
interstated north and south
