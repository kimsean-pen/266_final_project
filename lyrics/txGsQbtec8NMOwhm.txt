Oooh
Oooh

Can you feel me
When I think about you?
With every breath I take
Every minute
No matter what I do
My world is an empty place

Like I've been wanderin' the desert for a thousand days, oh
Don't know if it's a mirage, but I always see your face, baby

I'm missing you so much, can't help it I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side, don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh, oh-oh
Whoa, whoa

The stars are burning
I hear your voice in my mind
Can't you hear me callin'?
My heart is yearning
Like the ocean is running dry
Catch me I'm fallin'

It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet, won't you save me?
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me, oh baby

I'm missing you so much, can't help it I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side, don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh, oh-oh
Whoa, whoa

So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me
Stick around me baby, baby, baby, ooh
It's a world of wonder with you in my life
So hurry, baby, don't waste no more time
And I need you here, I can't explain
But a day without you
Is like a year without rain, oh, oh-oh

I'm missing you so much, can't help it I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side, don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh, oh-oh
Whoa, whoa, ooh

Oooh
Oooh
