Anything can't make me excited
Everyone packed in the street
But I don't care at all

Baby, I wish I could turn off everything
Now I'm so tired just thinking of you
I keep my head down

I am too weak
Baby, Everytime I fake it
When I see a beautiful thing
I feel like I'm a fool

And I want more
Head of buildings are shining through
I feel insecure
I want to settle down

I want more
I don't want to baby
Baby, I want more
I don't want to baby
Baby, I want more
I don't want to baby
Baby, I want more
I don't want to baby

Everything can't help me exalted
Everyone packed in the street
But I don't care at all

Everytime I wish I forget everything
Now I feel like losing myself
Hit my chest hard

I am too weak
Baby, Everytime I fake it
When I see a beautiful thing
I feel like I'm a fool

And I want more
Head of buildings are shining through
I feel insecure
I want to settle down

I want more
I don't want to baby
Baby, I want more
I don't want to baby
Baby, I want more
I don't want to baby
Baby, I want more
I don't want to baby

Baby, I ain't gonna ask ya
I'll lean on your shoulder
Who's gonna chase ya?

No, I don't fight to give you chance
Oh, I keep on my holder
I feel it, my hole

I want more
I don't want to baby
Baby, I want more
I don't want to baby
Baby, I want more
I don't want to baby
Baby, I want more
I don't want to baby
