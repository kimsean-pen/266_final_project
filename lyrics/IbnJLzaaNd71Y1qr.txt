It comes from all we're giving
In seemingly endless supply
As signals cross defiantly
Into this volatile mix we charge
And the stubborn mind repeats
The errors to challenge our grounds
Either soar above or the detour takes you right
Back down
To where no one wants to see
Misgivings in this starry nightlight
Fill in the blanks
That one will fall
To the haunts and horrors
To the haunts and horrors

There is nothing left
A mere shadow
When adrenaline runs dry
There is nothing there
An empty prop
When adrenaline runs dry

It gets you deep
Down low now
As they told you of the blazing heights
The stage from which the world is viewed
Is the mirror to shatter the image
The crypt he kept for hiding
Retreat from another attack
Painlessly forgiving
A refuge in deceptive black

It works within the system
And they won't understand
A lesser known deceiver
Will fool you even more

Now, now, now
Now taunt the wasted
It's all about nothing
What to squeeze within the span of attention
Brought to ground
Let the chaos pass
That one will fail
By the screams and terrors
By the screams and terrors

There is nothing left
A mere shadow
When adrenaline runs dry
There is nothing there
An empty prop
When adrenaline runs dry
