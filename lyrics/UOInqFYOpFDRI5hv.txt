Spiral: I want to say:
SM: It's my second hand wonder,
a thing that recovers the doubt
Spiral: Slim door,
Mark: Like a rainstorm, you've got to do
what you want and say it
SM: It's of my design assembled at the cut
Spiral: Slim door,
SM: It's all right to shake, to fight, to feel
Mark: You go down, down, down, down
Spiral: Slim door,
SM: It's all right to shake, to fight, to feel
Mark: You go down, down, down, down

SM: Harness your hopes to the folks
with the liquor with the ropes,
Red, red ropes, periscopes
They've got everything will ever need
stored under the chair

Simmer, simmer, simmer down
Simmer, simmer, simmer down
Don't waste your precious breath
explaining that you are worthwhile

Simmer, simmer, simmer down
Simmer, simmer, simmer down
Be patient and I'll let you see my
Carrot rope, feed my thrill,
I got beat by weather
Carrot rope, feed my thrill,
I got beat by weather
Carrot rope, feed my thrill,
It's time to get me off of the ground,

SM: Hey little boy, would you like to know
what's in my pocket or not
It's no ploy, it's no gimmick,
It's the chance of a lifetime to see
something that's never seen by mere mortals
Mark: Except me
Spiral: And myself
SM: And sweet I, so what do you say?
Would you like to play 20 questions with me?
SM: A little, little Christian lie,
A little, little Christian lie
Debating if it's time
to drop the bomb on you, my dear
A little, little Christian lie,
A little, little Christian lie
Let's get down to brass tacks and start it
A carrot rope, feed my thrill,
I got beat by weather
A carrot rope, feed my thrill,
I got beat by weather
Carrot rope, feed my thrill
It's time to get me off of the grounds
The wicket keeper is down,
The wicked keeper is down
And he gets me off of the grounds

Spiral: Leg
