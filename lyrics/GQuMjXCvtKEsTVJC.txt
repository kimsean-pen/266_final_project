Yellow tinted lenses and a pink gelato
Fallin' out the window, hit me back tomorrow
We'll always be the one tough act to follow
'Cause we aiming for the stars with a point and hollow
I'm feeling these songs, mocking jokes and carols
I started this job selling rocks and arrows
'Cause they only swipe right if you fuck for follows
Welcome to the days of the broke and shallow

But if we just spoke
Like we meant it
Would you reference
This open part of me
The minute I know
The time we spent in
Came corrected
In my anatomy

Matter over mind if we're being honest
But you wander through your thoughts like a broken promise
In it for the monetary growth of power
But we divided at the bottom of this whiskey sour
So leave it on the table if you hot and bothered
Tell me if you mean it baby, who's the father?
The stories of a land you divide and conquer
You really showing me the meaning of a losing offer

But if we just spoke
Like we meant it
Would you reference
This open part of me
The minute I know
The time we spent in
Came corrected
In my anatomy
