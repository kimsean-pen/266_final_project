I think we've fallen out of love
Times are getting tough and I want to leave
I know I shouldn't run
But now you're so grey when you were a dream
We met when I was young
And I am not the same as I used to be
I know we still have fun
But I don't feel so free

I miss country roads
Feeling of coming home
The sound of cutlery hitting the plate
Sweet old London
I think we've fallen out of love
I think we've fallen out of love
Times are getting tough and I want to leave
I know I shouldn't run
But now you're so grey when you were a dream
We met when I was young
And I am not the same as I used to be
I know we still have fun
But I don't feel so free

I miss country roads
Feeling of coming home
The sound of cutlery hitting the plate
Sweet old London
I think we've fallen out of love

You could convince me to stay
I think all I need is a little space
Cause I wake up every day
Longing for the smile of a familiar face
But your love comes at a cost
I've gotta be all in or it's not enough
And you're making this so tough
I'm not alone in feeling this lost

I miss the seaside breeze
The strangers' morning greet
To fall asleep seeing the stars light the darkest sky
Oh London
I think we've fallen out of love
I think we've fallen out of love
I think, I think

But it's that something feeling when the sun sets low
And you're warm inside whilst the city glows
All those magic moments 'cause there on the street
Is an old friend it's been years since you've seen
It gets you thinking "is it really that bad?"
'Cause we might have problems but we sure do laugh

Oh London, not out of love with you yet
But I need you to make me want you again
Oh London, can we be in love?
Can we be in love?
Can we be in love, love, love, love, love?
Oh London, can we be in love?
Can we be in love?
