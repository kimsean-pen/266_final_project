Come to my house tonight
We can be together in the nuclear sky
And we will dance in the poison rain
And we can stay a while in heaven today
Stay together
Let's stay, these days are ours
Stay together
Two hearts under the skyscrapers
Come to my arms tonight
You and me together under electric light
She will dance in the poisoned air
Just you and me forever by the motorway there
Stay together
Let's stay, these days are ours
Stay together
Two hearts under the skyscrapers
There's a time bomb in the high rise
There's a blue suburban dream
Will I see you up in paradise?
Or have you come to touch me?
Come to my arms I'm lost
Just you and me together in the year of the horse
Single file in the nuclear night
And we can feel a little closer as we tumble through the sky
Stay together
Let's stay, these days are ours
Stay together
Two hearts under the skyscrapers
Stay together
Let's stay, these days are ours
Stay together
Two hearts under the skyscrapers
Stay together
Let's stay, these days are ours
Stay together
Two hearts under the skyscrapers
