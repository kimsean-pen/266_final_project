Party rock!
Yeah
Woo!
Let's go
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time (Yeah)
And we gon' make you loose your mind (wooo!)
Everybody just have a good time (Clap)
Party rock is in the house tonight (ooww!)
Everybody just have a good time (I can feel it today)
And we gon' make you lose your mind (yeah!)
We just wanna see you...
Shake that!
In the club party rock
Look a pretty girl she on my jock (huh!)
Non-stop when we in the spot
Booty moving weight like she on the block (wooo!)
Where the drink, I gots' to know
Tight jeans, tattoos, cause I'm rock n' roll
Half black, half white, domino
Gain the money, Oprah dough (Yo!)
I'm runnin' through these hoes like Drano
I got that devilish flow rock n' roll, no halo
We party rock!
Yeah, that's the crew that I'm reppin'
On the rise to the top, no led in our zeppelin (heeeey!)
Party rock is in the house tonight (Wooo!)
Everybody just have a good time (Yeah)
And we gon' make you loose your mind
Everybody just have a good time (Let's go!)
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time (I can feel it babe)
And we gon' make you loose your mind
We just wanna see you...
Shake that!
Everyday I'm shuffling
Shuffling, shuffling
Step up fast and be the first girl to make me throw this cash
We gettin' money, don't be mad, now stop, hating is bad
One more shot for us (Another round!)
Please fill up my cup (Don't mess around!)
We just wanna' see (You shake it now!)
Now you wanna be (You're naked now!)
Get up, get down
Put your hands up to the sound
Get up, get down
Put your hands up to the sound
Get up, get down
Put your hands up to the sound (woo!)
Put your hands up to the sound
Put your hands up to the sound
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Put your hands up to the sound, to the sound
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Party rock is in the house tonight (put your hands up) (Oh)
Everybody just have a good time (put your hands up) (Yeah)
And we gon' make you loose your mind (Put your hands up)
Everybody just have a good, good, good, time
Ooohh! Ooooh! (Put your hands up)
Ooohh! Ooooh! Ooh! (I can feel it babe)
Ooohh! Ooooh! (put your hands up)

Put your, put your
Your hands up

Put your hands up
