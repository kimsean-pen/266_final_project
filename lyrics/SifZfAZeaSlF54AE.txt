Deep sea dive
Goddamn but you stayed alive
It's only you down there
You and that bend
And lose your mind
Lose track of breathing and time
It's only you down there
Sleep with the tides

And we can be anyone
It took so long to know someone like you
And each in the dying sun
Where only the bathing greens and blues

Die my love
Breathe in twos and fours
To know what's worth breathing for
Some days it's easier than falling asleep

And we can be anyone
It took so long to know someone like you
And each in the dying sun
Where only the bathing greens and blues
