Today could be the day you might make a change
Lock yourself indoors and plan a getaway
Take a walk outside in the heavy weather
The British summer time's just great, whatever

Join a local gang and get a cool nickname
Make your lifelong sweetheart your ball and chain
Convert yourself belief for a new religion
Or leave the TV on, make a decision when you're

Waiting for the day you're not looking
For something else, for something else
Waiting for the day you're not looking
For something else, for something else

Go put your last five Pounds on the lottery
If you're not in it to win it, well, then you won't receive
Then maybe place all your winning on an outsider
And if it wins you'll be grinning and you can celebrate

Six months of our lives are at a red light
And there's a thousand chances to get it right
So put your foot in the door because it's free admission
Or leave the TV on, make a decision when you're

Waiting for the day you're not looking
For something else, for something else
Waiting for the day you're not looking
For something else, for something else

Break away your ties and find a new squeeze
Show a local scheme your generosity
Stand back in the shadows and be a right hand man
Buy a brand new semi next door to the Taliban

Who knows what's around the bend
Stay up, get drunk with all your best friends
Celebrate your side to a new division
Or leave the TV on, make your own decisions

Waiting for the day you're not looking
For something else, for something else
Waiting for the day you're not looking
For something else, for something else

Waiting for the day you're not looking
For something else, for something else
Waiting for the day you're not looking
For something else, for something else

Don't let your day grow long before it comes a week
Go and make a change before the big sleep
