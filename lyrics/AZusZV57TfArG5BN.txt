Oh o-oh, Wake up
Oh o-oh, Wake up

All we know is time
That's slipping from our lives
A world that kept the truth
Hidden in the lies

Standing on the stage
Bleeding out our youth
Create a holy war
And sell it back to you

We'll shout it from the tallest building
We won't let them turn away
We'll show them what they've made
We'll be here when their heart stops beating
We the nation of today
Our hopes that never fade
We'll be here when their heart stops beating

Oh o-oh, Wake up
Oh o-oh, Wake up

See it in our eyes
That we were never blind
I will fight for you
Untill the day I die

We'll shout it from the tallest building
We won't let them turn away
We'll show them what they've made
We'll be here when their heart stops beating
We the nation of today
Our hopes that never fade
We'll be here when their heart stops beating

We won't let them turn away
We'll show them what they've made
We'll be here when their heart stops beating
We the nation of today
Our hopes that never fade
We'll be here when their heart stops beating

We won't let them turn away
We'll show them what they've made
We'll be here when their heart stops beating
We the nation of today
Our hopes that never fade
We'll be here when their heart stops beating

Oh o-oh, Wake up
Oh o-oh, Wake up
Oh o-oh, Wake up
Oh o-oh, Wake up
