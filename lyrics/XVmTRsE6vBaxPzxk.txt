Oh, my love, can't you stay?
I'm just not ready to leave this place
We had our troubles they faded away
All of our troubles faded away

Gentle breeze for beating hearts
I don't think anything can keep us apart
I don't want anything to keep us apart

It took a summer day so I could see
It took a summer day for me to know
That the past was a long time ago

And it feels so good
To be with you today
And I ask myself
How can I leave this place
'cause I'm ready to stay

How my heart can carry me
Sometimes I forget the beautiful things
You show me figures strange and sweet

It took a summer day so I could see
It took a summer day for me to know
That the past was a long time ago

It feels so good
To be with you today
And I ask myself
How can I leave this place

It's a perfect time
It's a perfect day
And I tell myself
That I'm ready to stay

Took a summer day
Took a summer day
Took a summer day
