Dadadadada

Tonight you can leave your mark
No ones watching in the darkness
Kiss me on the neck make a beautiful scar anywhere you like

No regrets all bets are off
We don't need a little talking
Listen to the madness in my heart

Can you read my mind?
It could be a lonely world
I want forever times forever

So give me something I can't live without
Be the sound of your name on my mouth
Give me something to keep dreaming about
All night all night oh yeah
Give me something I can't live without

Dadadadada

With the hours only 24
Every seconds a revolving door
Gonna hold on to your heart for sure
Til the end of time
It could be a lonely world
I want forever times forever

So give me something I can't live without
Be the sound of your name on my mouth
Give me something to keep dreaming about
All night all night oh yeah
Give me something
All night all night ohh

Ohh
Give me something

I can't live without
Give me something
I can't live without
Give me something I can't live without
Be the sound of your name on my mouth
Give me something to keep dreaming about
All night all night oh yeah
Give me something i can't live without
Be the sound of your name on my mouth
Give me something
All night all night oh yeah
All night all night oh yeah
