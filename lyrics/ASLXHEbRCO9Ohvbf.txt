Don't say goodbye
The circle of the moon, the rising of the sun
We'll be together soon, our story's just begun
Time will bring us near, I'll never be so far
Oh baby don't you fear, I'll always be right where you are

You can dry my tears
But you can't stop the pain inside I'm trying to hide
As I hold you near I know I have to pull away
You know that I can't stay

All of my life
No one has touched me the way that you do
Wherever I go
I know that the road will lead back to you

So don't say goodbye, don't turn away
It doesn't have to end today
Don't say goodbye
'Cause I will love you till the end of time
Don't say goodbye

Even though we'll be apart, we'll see the same stars
Just close your eyes and I'll be where you are
Don't say goodbye
'Cuz if you say that word my heart won't survive
Don't say goodbye

Can you feel my desire?
The way that my body's aching with your every breath
I try to memorize every move you're making
So I'll never forget

The way that you feel
Whenever your heart is beating with mine
Wherever I go
I'll keep my memories of you inside

Don't say goodbye, don't turn away
It doesn't have to end today
Don't say goodbye
'Cause I will love you till the end of time
Don't say goodbye

Even though we'll be apart we'll see the same stars
Just close your eyes and I'll be where you are
Don't say goodbye
'Cause if you say that word my heart won't survive
Don't say goodbye

The circle of the moon, the rising of the sun
We'll be together soon, our story's just begun
Time will bring us near, I'll never be so far
Oh, baby, don't you fear, I'll always be right where you are
Don't say goodbye

No me digas adios, quedate aqui conmigo
Don't say goodbye
Adios no es una palabra para nosotros
No te vallas, quedate aqui conmigo

So don't say goodbye, don't turn away
It doesn't have to end today
Don't say goodbye
'Cause I will love you till the end of time
Don't say goodbye

Even though we'll be apart we'll see the same stars
Just close your eyes and I'll be where you are
Don't say goodbye
'Cuz if you say that word my heart won't survive

Don't say goodbye, don't turn away
It doesn't have to end today
Don't say goodbye
'Cause I will love you till the end of time
Don't say goodbye

Even though we'll be apart we'll see the same stars
Just close your eyes and I'll be where you are
Don't say goodbye
'Cause if you say that word my heart won't survive

Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
