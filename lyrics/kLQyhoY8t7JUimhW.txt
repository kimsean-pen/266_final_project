Uh
Uh uh uh uh uh

Yo yo
Let me 'splain this to you
See I'm not gonna let you run me
How we're gonna do it is
I'm gonna run you

You
You've got a lot of nerve
I guess you haven't heard
I'm doin' fine out here
On my own you
You think that you can come
round here for some fun
But boy you've got a lot to learn

Bridge:
Don't shake your head
From side to side
Sayin' that you're changed enough
That you see the light
Cuz you just say what you say
And want your way
And it's that game that you play
It's a little late

Chorus:
As if
I'm ever gonna take you back
As if
It's ever gonna come to that
So see you 'round
You wave goodbye
Be a bird
Pass me by
As if
I'm gonna let you break my heart again
As if I'm gonna let your love
Back in my life
Not tonight
Get a grip
Baby as if

Uh uh uh uh (uh uh)
Uh uh uh uh (uh uh)
Uh uh uh uh (uh uh no no)

You seem to think that I (I)
Ain't got no sense of pride (pride)
Well boy you got a weird perception now (yo)
Of what it is to love (love)
And I am sure because (because)
You got a look with desperation

Bridge:
Don't shake your head from left to right
Sayin that you will when you won't ever see the light
And you just say what you say
And want your way
And it's that game that you play
it's a little late

Chorus:
As If
I'm ever gonna take you back
As if
It's ever gonna come to that
So see you 'round
You wave goodbye
Be a bird
Pass me by
As if
I'm gonna let you break my heart again
As if I'm gonna let your love
Back in my life
Not tonight
Catch my drift
Baby As If

Uh uh uh uh (uh uh)
Uh uh uh uh (uh uh)
Uh uh uh uh
No no no no no no

I got places to go
With people you don't know
We gonna dance all nice and slow

Bridge:
Don't shake your head from left to right
Sayin that your changed and all now your on my side
Cause you just want what you want with some lucky charm
And it's that game that you play
so im moving on

Chorus:
As If
I'm never gonna take you back
As if
It's ever gonna come to that
So be a dear
Dissapear
Maybe Im not being clear
As if
I'm gonna let you break my heart again
As if I'm gonna let your love
Back in my life
Not tonight
Get a grip
Baby As If

Chorus

As If
Im never gonna take you back
As If
Its never gonna come to that
So see ya round
You wave goodbye
Be a bird
Pass me by
As If
Im gonna let you break my heart again
As if I m gonna let your love back in my life
Not tonight
Get a grip
Baby As If

I'm gonna let you break my heart again
As if I'm gonna let you try and be my friend
It's the end
Take the hint
Baby as if
Ha ha ha
