Will I ever get to, to where it is that I've been going?
Will I ever follow through with what I, with what I have planned.
I guess it's possible that I have been a bit distracted
and the directions for me are a lot less in demand,
in demand.

Will I ever get to where I'm going?
If I do, will I know when I am there?
If the wind blew me in the right direction
would I even care?
I would.

I take a look around; it's evident the scene has changed.
And there are times when I feel improved, improved upon the past.
Then there are times when I can't seem to understand at all
and yes it seems as though I'm goin nowhere...
really fucking fast, nowhere fast.

Will I ever get to where I'm going?
If I do, will I know when I am there?
If the wind blew me in the right direction
would I even care?
I would, I would.

Will I ever get to where I'm going?
If I do, will I know when I am there?
If the wind blew me in the right direction
would I even care?
I would, I would, I would, I would, I would.
