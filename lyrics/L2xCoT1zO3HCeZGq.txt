When I was small, light-hearted girl
My daddy said: be true and strong,
And I was trying all the time
I knew all rules
But failed an exam
I'm like a bird - black or white
I live my life wrong or right
I met you then
It was so cool
But I forgot the world has a rules
One life's too short to say it all
I'm who I am, can't please them all
I'm like a bird - black or white
I live my life wrong or right
