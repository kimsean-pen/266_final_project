Anyone
Anyone
Anyone
Anyone

You can blame me
Try to shame me
And still I'll care for you
You can run around
Even put me down
Still I'll be there for you
The world
May think I'm foolish
They can't see you
Like I can

Oh but anyone
Who knows what love is
Will understand

Anyone
Anyone
Anyone
I just feel so sorry (anyone)
For the ones
Who pity me
(Anyone) 'Cause they just don't know
(Anyone) Oh they don't know what happiness and love can be
I know
I know to ever let you go
It's more
Than I
Could ever stand

Oh but anyone
Who knows what love is
Will understand

Oh (anyone) they'll understand
(Anyone) If they try love they'll understand (anyone)
(Anyone) Oh try to understand (anyone)
(Anyone)
