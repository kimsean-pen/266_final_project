Civilization's dying
And no one's realizing
The position of hate stuck inside the gun

Civilization's crying
And I won't try to deny it
We got a problem son,
Something's gotta be done

{Chorus}
With the Pope
And the president
And the big rockstar who made alot of money
All got one thing in common
They know it ain't no fun to get shot with a gun
{End of Chorus}

Civilization's dying
And no one's realizing
The position of hate stuck inside the gun

Civilization's crying
And I won't try to deny it
We got a problem son,
Something's gotta be done

{Chorus}

Civilization's dying
And no one's realizing
The position of hate stuck inside the gun

Civilization's crying
And I won't try to deny it
We got a problem son,
Something's gotta be done

With the Pope, and the president,
and the big rockstar who made alot of money (x4)
Made alot of money, made alot of money, made alot of money
Yeah!
