You're no true soul, you'll never be
Man-made device, you've haunted me
You're built to serve, to calculate
You're built to love, to overtake

Stay with me
For I would never ever leave you
Hold my hand
For I would never ever let it see an end
Oh, you are mine
Oh, I could never ever leave you behind
Oh, stay with me
For I would never ever leave you

Look at you now, you're a dying machine
Cold and disfigured, corrupted, diseased
Again, you've come back, oh, I'll die in this place
Mechanical cradle, synthetic embrace
You're a dying machine
You're a dying machine

The years go by, you follow me
Manufactured eyes see everything
Your corroding core degenerates
Programmed to love and terminate

Oh, I must stay
For I could never ever turn your love away
Oh, you're the one
For I could never ever see our love undone
I'm not your fool
And I could never ever say a thing so cruel
So stay with me
Cause I am never ever gonna leave you

Look at you now, you're a dying machine
Cold and disfigured, corrupted, diseased
Again, you've come back, oh, I'll die in this place
Mechanical cradle, synthetic embrace

You're a dying machine
You're a dying machine
You're a dying machine
You're a dying machine

As deep as any ocean
Like a promise of the morning sun
Never ending, never done
The scale of my devotion

I crave until we love again
Follow to the bitter end
Like walking in a nightmare

A travesty, a shell born dead
Fabricated, interbred
Relentless as you like it

Never ending, never gone
Never changing, never done
Never changing, never done

Look at you now, you're a dying machine
Cold and disfigured, corrupted, diseased
Again you've come back, oh, I'll die in this place
Mechanical cradle, synthetic embrace

You're a dying machine
You're a dying machine
You're a dying machine
You're a dying machine
