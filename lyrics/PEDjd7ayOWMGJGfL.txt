Love sees love's happiness
But happiness can't see that love is sad, love is sad
Sadness is hanging there
To show love somewhere something needs a change, they need a change

They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane to take the house he built for her apart
To make it break it's gonna take a metal ball hung from a chain
They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane to pick the broken ruins up again
To mend her heart, to help him start to see a world apart from pain

Lad's gal is all he has
Gal's gladness hangs upon the love of lad, the love of lad
Some things gal says to lad
Aren't meant as bad but cause a little pain, they cause him pain

They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane to take the house he built for her apart
To make it break it's gonna take a metal ball hung from a chain
They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane to pick the broken ruins up again
To mend her heart, to help him start to see a world apart from pain

Don't call me at work again, no no, the boss still hates me
I'm just tired and I don't love you anymore
And there's a restaurant we should check out where the other nightmare people like to go
I mean nice people, baby wait, I didn't mean to say nightmare

Lad looks at other gals
Gal thinks Jim Beam is handsomer than lad, he isn't bad
Call off the wedding band
Nobody wants to hear that one again, play that again

They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane to take the house he built for her apart
To make it break it's gonna take a metal ball hung from a chain
They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane to pick the broken ruins up again
To mend her heart, to help him start to see a world apart from pain

They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane
They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane
They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane
They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane
They'll need a crane
