Here i am,
I know it's late...
It's crazy...
...maybe not...
i'm sorry marin...

Mary, i hope you can hear what i'm saying
Mary, 'coz i always needed to tell it
Mary, i'm not here to ask you to long me
Mary, at least tell me that you forgive me.

Chorus:

Marin, i want you to know that i'm sorry
Marin, i really cannot keep on worrying
Marin, i'm feeling that we could be happy
Marin, in time, what happened to feelings?
Marin, without you a really went crazy
Marin, so long, and why are you still waiting?

Mary, i hope you can hear what i'm saying
Mary, 'coz i always needed to tell it
Mary, i'm not here to ask you to long me
Mary, at least tell me that you forgive me.

Chorus:

Mary, i want you to know that i'm sorry
Mary, i really cannot keep on worrying
Mary, i'm feeling that we could be happy
Mary, in time, what happened to feelings?
Mary, without you a really went crazy
Mary, so long, and why are you still waiting?
