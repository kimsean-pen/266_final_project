Run around
And we got them under
Run around
Catching everything they throw at us
Cause they're jealous of our rebel love

Gone around
No one's ever gonna hurt us now
Just another night, another town
Let us be the ones they talk about

Don't let go
Broken but we're free
Where is gold?
Lay your head on me

Renegades
Renegades, ooh
Runaways
Runaways, ooh
You and I together we are one

We are renegades
Renegades, ooh
Runaways
Runaways
You and I will ride into the sun
Together we are one

Do or die
They can never make us testify
They can try to take away the fire
We will rise above it every time

Don't let go
Broken but we're free

Renegades
Renegades, ooh
Runaways
Runaways,
You and I together we are one

We are renegades
Renegades, ooh
Runaways
Runaways
You and I will ride into the sun
Together we are one
Together we are one

Renegades
Renegades, ooh
Runaways,
Runaways,
You and I together we are one

Renegades
Renegades, ooh
Runaways
Runaways,
You and I will ride into the sun

We are renegades
Renegades, ooh
Runaways
Runaways
You and I will ride into the sun
Together we are one
Together we are one
Together we are one

You and I will ride into the sun
Together we are one
