Optical illusion, sexual confusion
In the best way
Liberal perception, premature connection
Always hearsay, always hearsay
We are in the prime of our existence
(But I think you know the truth it's you)
We are running blind with no resistance
(Oh, oh)
Why not give it a try
Be a beautiful monstrosity
When you're just getting by
And happily terminal
Yeah, breathe it until we're high
Have some fun, hope you see
Forget what I need
Give me what I want
And it should be fine
Forget what I need
Give me what I want
And it should be fine
Forget what I need
Give me what I want
And it should be fine
Forget what I need
Give me what I want
And it should be fine
Forget what I need
Give me what I want
And it should be fine
Fresh intoxication, retro retaliation
Do you feel me? Do you feel me?
Pointing my pollution, electro-execution
Can you kill me? Can you kill me eh, eh?
We are in the prime of our existence
(But I think you know the truth it's you)
We are running blind with no resistance
(Oh, oh)
Why not give it a try?

Forget what I need
Give me what I want

Forget what I need
Give me what I want
And it should be fine
Forget what I need
Give me what I want
And it should be fine
In the prime
You are my medicine
In the prime
You are my history
Only got a feeling that it won't
Got to give it up before my turn is up
Why not give it a try
Be a beautiful monstrosity
When you're just getting by
And happily terminal
Yeah, breathe it until we're high
Have some fun, hope you see
Forget what I need
Give me what I want

Forget what I need
Give me what I want
And it should be fine
