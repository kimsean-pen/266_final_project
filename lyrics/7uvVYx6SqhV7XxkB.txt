I wish I had a mango tree in my backyard
With you standin' next to me take the picture
'Cause from her lips I heard her say can I have you?
Caught up on what to say I said you do
I said you do, I said you do

Through my eyes I can see a shootin' star
Weavin' its way across the sea somewhere from mars
It's down the street we would run to scratch our names in the path
Young and free in the sun wheels upon the tar I said you do
I said you do, I said you do, I said you do

I wish I had a mango tree in my backyard
With you standin' next to me take the picture
'Cause from her lips I heard her say can I have you?
Caught up on what to say I said you do
I said you do, I said you do, I said you do, I said you do
