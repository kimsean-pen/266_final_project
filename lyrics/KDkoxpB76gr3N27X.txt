Lamashtu, Dim-me

Demon queen, mother of ghouls
Ancient primitive mistress of insanity
Bring forth shadows of seven witches
Mothers cry, children stolen, Sumerian prophecy
Lamashtan demon mother, ruler of perversions

Rise, rise, now

Come forth instigator of wicked dreams - Lamashtu
I summon thee, mother of beasts - Dim-me

Raven wings, serpent tail

Malevolent goddess harvest at night
From the darkness of Kurnugia she calls out
Seven names, seven voices, seven incantations
Three-eyed jackal, pestilence tongue
Abomination, blood be spilled
Under a dying sun, the bringer of nocturnal light

Rise, rise, now

Awakened now from your immemorial slumber
Your time has come to reenter this world
Raging wild, vengeance, insatiable hunger
Shadowless night in abyss shines so bright
Seven taps, unborn soul in your chamber
Unholy wrath Lamashtan might
Thirst for blood comes furious thunder
Holocaust of man draws near
The witches' vision birthing plunder
Thousand infant souls in enchantress' sphere
