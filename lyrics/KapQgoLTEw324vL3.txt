These words he speaks are true
We're all humanary stew if
We don't pledge allegiance to
The Black Widow

The horror that he brings
The horror of his sting
The unholiest of kings
The Black Widow

Our minds will be his toy
And every girl and boy will learn to be employed by
The Black Widow

Love me
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him

He sits upon his throne and picks at all the bones of his
Husbands and his
Wives he's devouredHe stares with a gleam
With a laugh so obscene at the virgins and the children
He's deflowered

Love me
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him

Our thoughts are hot and crazed
Our brains are webbed in haze
Of mindless senseless daze
The Black Widow

These things he says are true
We're all humanary stew
If we don't pledge allegiance to
The Black Widow
