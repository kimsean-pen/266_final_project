I feel tired
I look it too
Tear me up
You always do
Wear me down
It's hard to love
When we're apart
Night is day
Where we are from
Try again
I missed your call
Melt me back
You always do
When we're apart
I can't be where you are
Oh whoa oh, oh whoa oh
This distance is all we've got
Oh whoa oh, oh whoa oh
Tell me something happy
Don't make me sad
Tell me something happy
Don't make me sad
Tell me something happy
Don't make me sad
D-D-Don't make me sad
Sad, sad, sad
Tell me something happy
Think I might
I think I may
Air is sweet
I feel okay
Heard from you
I've let us down
Again
I'd play a song
If we had one
I weigh a shed
To keep me warm
I miss you
I always do
When we're apart
I can't be where you are
Oh whoa oh, oh whoa oh
This distance is all we've got
Oh whoa oh, oh whoa oh
Tell me something happy
Don't make me sad
Tell me something happy
Don't make me sad
Tell me something happy
Don't make me sad
D-D-Don't make me sad
Sad, sad, sad
Tell me something happy
Tell tell tell me something happy
Oh whoa oh, oh whoa oh
Tell tell tell me something happy
Oh whoa oh, oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Don't let the dark in
You're gonna lose it
Don't let the dark in
You're gonna lose it
Tell me something happy
Don't make me sad
Tell me something happy
Don't make me sad
Tell me something happy
Don't make me sad
D-D-Don't make me sad
Sad, sad, sad
Tell me something happy
Oh whoa oh, oh whoa oh
Tell tell tell me something happy
Oh whoa oh, oh whoa oh
Tell tell tell tell me something happy
Oh whoa oh, oh whoa oh
Tell tell tell me something happy
