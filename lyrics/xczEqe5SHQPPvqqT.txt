Oh mother God we hold the sword in holy times
We are the war, never see the light
The order call, we all will take more human wine
And we toast to the night

We fold our hands, we keep the bible in our minds
Oh father God, we are the hordes of Cain
And though you run we will take you and we find
Any type, any vein

We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we call the sanguine saints
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we open your veins

Oh father lord, we are the demons of the wild
When all we pray, stand the fight as one
We tame the storm, we are the martyrs in the light
Take your soul when you run

We are the dark, we are the saints of blood at night
We hear the call, when the moon shines red
We grab your body, in the morning all we are
Satisfied when you're dead

We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we call the sanguine saints
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we open your veins

We drink, we drink
We drink your blood
We drink, we drink
We drink your blood

We drink your blood
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
We drink your blood
And we call the sanguine saints
We drink your blood
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
We drink your blood
And we open your veins
We drink your blood
