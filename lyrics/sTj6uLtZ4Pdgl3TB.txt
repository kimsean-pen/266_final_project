through sparrow black wind
a dead crow calls out to his wing
we were lightning across the whole world
we were lightning(x3)
and the guise to black cats we made a cross when our shadows met
and the guise to black cats we made a pact when our shadows passed
through sparrow black wind
a dead crow calls out to its wings
I'm getting weaker I'm getting thin
I hate how obvious I have been
I'm getting weaker(x4)
and I look down and see the whole world
and it's fading(repeat)
