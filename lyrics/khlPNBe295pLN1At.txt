First man on my heart
Left the usual mark
Yeah you're the bar that everybody has to move

And you know it cause
You like to call me up
Knowing I'm powerless to turn away from you

Hadn't been in love before
And so you keep your score
Thought I was stronger than this
Should hold back longer than this

It's like we say it's over
And it brings us closer
Like the odds are all fixed
Like we are fated to stick

Ooooooooh
Sometimes I wonder why we fight it
What if this is the right thing to do?

To do, to do
When we both feel it, it's magnetic
Can't we let it pull me back to you

Logic and the soul
Don't work as one, I know
And there is nothing smart about
Me and you

But say I do break free
Yeah say you let me be
Is there even someone better
After you

And like a forest to a fire
A fuse to a lighter
Like we want to explode
Like we get high on the smoke

They say we should know better
We aren't good together
But we fail to resist
Guess we're not stronger than this

Ooooooooh
Sometimes I wonder why we fight it
What if this is the right thing to do?

To do, to do
When we both feel it, it's magnetic
Can't we let it pull me back to you

(...)

Ooooooooh
Sometimes I wonder why we fight it
What if this is the right thing to do?

To do, to do
When we both feel it, it's magnetic
Can't we let it pull me back to you
To you, to you

Sometimes I wonder why we fight it
What If this is the right thing to do?

To do, to do
When we both feel it, it's magnetic
Can't we let it pull me back to you
