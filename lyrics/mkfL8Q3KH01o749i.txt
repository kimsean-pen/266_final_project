You left me when I was young and
so... young and so... young and so stupid

You left me when I was young and so stupid
I am not spiteful
I can't do what you did
I open my mind just to find that I'm useless
Speeches abusive and rude I'm so clueless
Useless, nothing is new, I could shoot you like cupid
That wasn't cute and you knew it
I'm dreaming lucid
I feel when you touch me
I'm loosin'
I feel so stupid
There's nowhere to run, I can't find my gun
There's nowhere to hide, so I stay inside by myself
Lies on the shelf, I got crumbs on my belt
I got weapons they tucked in my closet

Have you ever felt alone, with people all around you?
Did you always want to know, why they leave without you?
Have you ever heard a song and thought it was about you?
Feel it in your soul, then you let it take control

I should let you know, Imma let you down for sure
Though my heart is very cold, I could never let it show
I keep a pistol in my coat cuz my pockets full of dough
So I could bring you everywhere you ever want to go
Tell me now, I want to know
Tell me how my story goes
Will I live, or will I die?
Imma go slow then change my flow (let's go)
My feelings are toxic, destruction, I watch it
I'll fold like its nothing, bodies are dropping
I can not watch anymore, I'm so natious
I'm losing friends and I'm losing options
(I should let you know Imma let you down for sure)

Have you ever felt alone, with people all around you?
Did you always want to know, why they leave without you?
Have you ever heard a song and thought it was about you?
Feel it in your soul, then you let it take control
