I'm right here in front of you,
and I can't stop sh-sh-shaking
I can't stop sh-sh-shaking.
Come on and hold me still.

Did my heart love until now?
'Cause I feel as though I've never seen
beauty till this night.
I'm forever, yeah, I'm forever yours.

You're wearing your skin like it's too tight.

And there she was, reflecting so brightly the warmth that she installs.
And there she was, we were infinite for a moment

There's not one girl here that will be lead by her conscience
in a world where every girl wants to be a model
what's wrong babe?
did daddy not give you enough attention.

Did my heart love until now?
'Cause I feel that I've never seen
beauty till this night.
I'm forever, yeah, I'm forever yours.

Take back what's mine. (yeah, I'm forever yours)
Just leave me in it,
and everything that I believe in (yeah, I'm forever yours)
She's shaking. She's shaking.
Please act surprised.
She's shaking. She's shaking.
Please act surprised.
She's shaking. She's shaking.
Please act surprised.
She's shaking. She's shaking.

And there she was, reflecting so brightly the warmth that she installs.
And there she was, we were infinite for a moment
And there she was, we were infinite for a moment
