Look, I not trying to start an argument with you
But you haffi tell me what it is that you want
I mean, your career is putting us in two different places
And I'm, to be honest
I don't know if I can live with you like this anymore
Just tired to be alone
I don't know what you want me to do boy
You just... you... I mean, you're never around

Well I'ma do my thing like this
Rock to di riddim like this
They love me when I sing like this, like this, like this
Well I'ma roll my spliff like this
They call me when I get like this
And take a lickkle lift like this, like this, like this

Have no idea what you're facing
But on some plain, we all go through the same things
So I'ma send these thoughts to you
With nuttin' but love, with nuttin' to prove, nobody be blaming
And I trust you gave into some cravings
But haven't we all been through those phases
So whenever you make it back I'm waiting
With open arms, forgive move on, no love's gone

So I'ma do my thing like this
Rock to di riddim like this
She love it when I sing like this, like this, like this
When I'm up in that groove like this
Girl I love it when you move like this
So tell me how you are gon' lose like this, like this, like this

Girl I was on a plane with it
Almost half the time we have to make visit
No, it not gon' ever be the same is it?
So I make up my mind I'm never playin' with it
We haffi get up and go baby and break limits
Look at me three in a row
How was you sane wit' it?
And plus I told you one was in the brain
And this not even it
It's one pressure for the zip
Lock it put it in a grip like

I'ma do my thing like this
Rock to di riddim like this
She love it when I sing like this, like this, like this
When I'm up in that groove like this
Girl I love it when you move like this
So tell me how you are gon' lose like this, like this, like this

Girl I wan put you in a crown
No put a never once on you in a clown
Verse when you move so when it be time go down
Can't say a ting no me lips don't make a sound
'Cause I pray you pick me
You're safer with me
You're independent like Jamaica fifty
Pull a raise ma' pick me
You prefer the world chile
Call it whatever we gon' make it worthwhile
Whirl while pop style like

I'ma do my thing like this
Rock to the riddim like this
She love it when I sing like this, like this, like this
When I'm up in that groove like this
Girl I love it when you move like this
So tell me how you are gon' lose like this, like this, like this

I'ma do my thing like
Rock to di riddim like
She love me when I, she love me when I
she love me when I sing like (like)
I'ma roll my spliff like
Take a lickkle lift like (yeah)
Take a lickkle lift, take a lickkle lift like
