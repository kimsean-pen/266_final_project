Welcome to the broken low
Welcome to the famous disco live
Come on lady come and go
Come on lady get me once and right
Not a danger, not a blacky stranger
Rock it - rock it - knock to my door I'll open
Speak my name now, speak if it you know how
Fly to me, get ready for the
Night of fire, you've better better stay
You've better better begin the prayer to play
Night of fire, come over over me
Come over over the top you've never been here
Night of fire, you've better better stay
You've better better begin the prayer to play
Night of fire, come over over me
Come over over the top you'll have a night of fire
You'll have a night of fire
Welcome to my rocky show
Welcome to the fire of the night
Come on baby let it go
Come on baby let me stick you tight
Not a danger, not a blacky stranger
Rock it - rock it - knock to my door I'll open
Speak my name now, speak if it you know how
Fly to me, get ready for the
Night of fire, you've better better stay
You've better better begin the prayer to play
Night of fire, come over over me
Come over over the top you've never been here
Night of fire, you've better better stay
You've better better begin the prayer to play
Night of fire, come over over me
Come over over the top you'll have a night of fire
You'll have a night of fire
You better better stay
The prayer to play
Come over over me
You've never been here
Night of fire
You've better better begin
Night of fire
Come over over the top
You'll have a night of fire
Welcome to the broken low
Welcome to the famous disco live
Come on lady come and go
Come on lady get me once and right
Not a danger, not a blacky stranger
Rock it - rock it - knock to my door I'll open
Speak my name now, speak if it you know how
Fly to me, get ready for the night of Fire
You'll have a night of fire
Night of fire
