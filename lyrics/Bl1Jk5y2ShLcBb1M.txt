None of those games, love
I want none of those games, love
None of those games, love
I want none of those games, love

Oh it took days to cross the desert
It's like a copy of a copy
My mind in a haze of delusion
And nothing made sense there but you

And if somebody holds you close
You are mine, you are mine
And if somebody tears your clothes off
You are mine, you are mine

An elastic state of mind, oh
I don't know if I'm hallucinating
An elastic state of mind, oh
I don't know if I'm hallucinating

None of those games, love
I want none of those games, love

All lost years are illusion
I'm like a mirror against a mirror
In one ear and out the other
We keep repeating, repeating, repeating

And I'm wondering if you know
You are mine, you are mine
And if somebody tears your clothes off
You are mine, you are mine, ooo

An elastic state of mind, oh
I don't know if I'm hallucinating
An elastic state of mind, oh
I don't know if I'm hallucinating
(I don't know if I'm hallucinating)

I don't know if I'm hallucinating
I don't know if I'm hallucinating
Oh, I
(If somebody tears your clothes off)
(You are mine, you are mine)

And I'm wondering if you know
You are mine, you are mine
And if somebody holds you close now
You are mine, you are mine

An elastic state of mind, oh
I don't know if I'm hallucinating
An elastic state of mind, oh
I don't know if I'm hallucinating

(I don't know if I'm hallucinating)
(I don't know if I'm hallu...)
Oh, I
(I don't know if I'm hallucinating)
I don't know if I'm hallucinating
