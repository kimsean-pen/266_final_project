Paradise
World without end
Hopelessness
Sinks into the earth

Crying life
Kaleidoscope
Hopelessness
The shifting beauty

My mother's love
Her gentle touch
My father's hand
Rests on my throat

Hopelessness
Myself, I'm here, not here
As a point
Of consciousness
As a point

Paradise
World without end
Hopelessness
Sinks into the earth

My crying life, my crying life
Kaleidoscope (Without escape)
Hopelessness
Sinks into the earth

Staring at myself
I feel giant and trapped
Seemingly
Without escape

I'm stuffed inside
My eternity
I'm here, not here
As a point of consciousness

Paradise
World without end
Hopelessness
Sinks into the earth

My crying life, my crying life
Kaleidoscope, kaleidoscope
(Dream against me)
Hopelessness
Hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
(Dream against me)

Here, myself, here, here

Paradise
World without end
Hopelessness
Myself, I'm here, not here
