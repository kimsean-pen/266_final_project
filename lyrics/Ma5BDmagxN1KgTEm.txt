So this is what you mean
And this is how you feel
So this is how you see
And this is how you breathe

Sometimes, I know
Sometimes I go down deep

So this is what you mean
And this is how you feel
So this is how you see
And this is how you breathe

But sometimes, I know
Sometimes I go down deep

Beneath the deep blue sea
You're touching every breath
And all the sleight of hand
For everything you left
Sometimes, I know
Sometimes I go down deep
Sometimes, I give myself away
Sometimes I know down deep
