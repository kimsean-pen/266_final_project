Hope you know
I'm already under your skin
The words upon your tongue
I know before you begin 'em

Unlatch the door lever
You're not letting me in
'Cause nothing you can do
Will make me swallow my grin

Take it slow
I won't resist
Just risk it
My shadow was always distant
Until now

You might believe that
I intend to infringe on you
Night and day until it sparks
Until it starts
To singe the light

But I can see you
Hope you see me

I'm gonna get a little closer closer
I'm gonna get a little closer close to you

I'm gonna get a little closer closer
I'm gonna get a little closer close to you

All the rest and in between
And all of the things that I have seen
At Night (I bite)
You know that my venom can sting
If I'm out of sight I'll play you like a
Puppet on a string

Yes I'm not mistaken
Blank out
I'm wasted on you

(I'm gonna get a little closer closer)
(I'm gonna get a little closer closer)

See through blindness
This heart's timeless
Wind blows chimes hit
Still I just sit

Window blinds close
As the vines grow
I can see you
Hope you see me

I'm gonna get a little closer closer
I'm gonna get a little closer close to you

I'm gonna get a little closer closer
I'm gonna get a little closer close to you

I'm gonna get a little closer closer
I'm gonna get a little closer close to you

I'm gonna get a little closer closer
I'm gonna get a little closer close to you

(I'm gonna)

Closer to you
Closer to you

(I'm gonna)

I'm gonna get a little closer closer
I'm gonna get a little closer close to you

Closer to you
Closer to you

Closer to you
Closer to you

Closer to you
Closer to you

Closer to you
