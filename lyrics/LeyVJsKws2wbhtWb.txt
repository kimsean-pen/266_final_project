I was on the roller coaster
Found the ground just in time
I was underwater when the siren came and saved my life
Every day started out last night
Every night started over
I was on the roller coaster
Found the ground just in time
Underneath the power lines

Last transmission from the island radio
Double vision wrapped in last night's party clothes
I can't spend another night alone
I tried swimming but I can't get home
Last transmission from the island radio

I could load the catapult and meet you on the other side
You could fold the map in half
I wouldn't have to take this ride
And every day's just another flight
Every flight's almost over
I could load the catapult and meet you on the other side
The other side

Last transmission from the island radio
Double vision wrapped in last night's party clothes
I can't spend another night alone
I tried swimming but I can't get home
Last transmission from the island radio

I wish that you were on what I was on
But you were only on my mind
I wish that you were on what I was on
But you were only on my mind
I wish that you were on what I was on
Yeah, I'm so gone

This is my last transmission from the island radio
Double vision wrapped in last night's party clothes
I can't spend another night alone
I tried swimming but I can't get home
Last transmission from the island radio
