Live your life
Like your a demigod
You force your weight
On everything and everyone
The bars you live
Behind are made of straw
How do you see the world
When you're dead and gone
I dare not say what I want to say
No sudden movements
No sudden moves
I dare not say whats inside of me
Right
Between your eyes
Nowhere to hide

Life
Ain't on your side
You're out of time

You're a wolf
Hiding amongst the herd
You built a bridge
So you can watch it burn
Kick and scream
Your voice is never heard
Write down your complaints
And I'll act like I'm concerned
I dare not say what I want to say
No sudden movements
No sudden moves
I dare not say whats inside of me
Right
Between your eyes
Nowhere to hide
