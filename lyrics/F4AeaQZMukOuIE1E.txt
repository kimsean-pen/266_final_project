When I found out this love's undone
I was like a gun, sure as it was over
Felt like nothing good could come

Sure as it's gonna play and play
Like Michael back in the day

I'm gonna peel you away

Now as I begin to wash you off my skin
I'm gonna peel you away
'Cause you're not right within

I love you so
Sometimes love has to let go

So this time don't think it's a lie
I say goodbye

Now as I begin to wash you off my skin
I'm gonna peel you away
'Cause you're not right within

Now it's time to wash you off my skin

Now as I begin, it couldn't be right
'Cause you're not right within

I say goodbye
