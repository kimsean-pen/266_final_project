We've planted a seed
An ever-growing wonder
To a beautiful tree
Grow

Each branch outstretched
And different from the rest
(From the rest)
Where the old have broken off
Some easier than the last
The right ones have grown in
To fill in the gaps
And all are equal in love and trust
And all are a part of something
So much bigger than this

Through the trials
Our tongues are tied
To trying times
So many unsaid lines
So many unsaid lines

Our lives were over at so many moments
So many moments, so many
And now they're all just beginning
And now they're all just beginning
Our lives were over at so many moments

I have never been so consumed
And I have never loved it more
To be devoted to letting all see
What it is to live in the love of others
To live in the love of my brothers
And spilling back all that anyone has ever spilled for me
To show that to those who have never seen
Four years ago we planted a seed
Found that foundation that we need
Strived for the perfect balance
To show love and show compassion

And our vision for this world
Will not die when we are dead
(When we are dead)
And our vision for this world
Will not die when we are dead
(When we are dead)
When we are dead, oh

My future started with the first note
That I ever played
The first note that was ever sang
My future started with the first note
That I ever played
The first note that was ever sang
The first note that was ever sang
(The first note that was ever sang)
When we started living with purpose
And writing with meaning
(The first note that was ever sang)
This is what we were made for
Every day I live this future
(The first note that was ever sang)
The first note that was ever sang
The first note that was ever sang
