My name is calypso
and i have lived alone
i live on an island
and i waken to the dawn
a long time ago
i watched him struggle with the sea
i knew that he was drowning
and i brought him into me
now today
come morning light
he sails away
after one last night
i let him go.

my name is calypso
my garden overflows
thick and wild and hidden
is the sweetness there that grows
my hair it blows long
as i sing into the wind
my name is calypso
and i have lived alone
i live on an island
i tell of nights
where i could taste the salt on his skin

salt of the waves
and of tears
and though he, pulled away
i kept him here for years
i let him go

my name is calypso
i have let him go
in the dawn he sails away
to be gone forever more
and the waves will take him in again
but he'll know their ways now
i will stand upon the shore
with a clean heart

and my song in the wind
the sand will sting my feet
and the sky will burn
it's a lonely time ahead
i do not ask him to return
i let him go
i let him go
