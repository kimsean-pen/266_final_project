You and me
We finally break free
Find the mess would cad[?]

Our lives behind you
That carry the burnout
Guess it's alright
Guess it's alright

You and me
To live the world like
Play the sunset goodbye

Our time that stands tall
Away kinetic[?]
Guess it's just right
Guess it's just fine

True
Only it's true
When you make me die in
Your hands

Run away from this parade
See
Maintain disease
Would you make me die in
Your hands

Run away from this charade
True
Only it's true
When you make me die in
Your hands

Run away from this parade
See
Maintain disease
Would you make me die in
Your hands
