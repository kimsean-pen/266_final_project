All I can ask is that we stay like this forever because
I've spent a decade just wishing that we could
Fantasies were unmet, and we never kept our promises
But this time I swear I have it figured out for good

You can be found in the cheapest and sweetest of bottles I have ever swallowed down
I'd rather have you than this spinning room that smells like cheap booze and perfume

When you wrote me off, I wrote a song about a holocaust
You were the premise that dropped the melody into my head
Like a bomb that falls and spreads itself across the harbor of my heart
Destroying every single vessel in the bay
I feel the same way
Cheated
Depleted
A once-boastful army defeated by a play-Judas bullet to the lips
Just check the tube of your chapstick
It's shaped the same
I shape myself around you
But you never take the blame

I was 200-0
My god,
You came around last minute, brought the loss to me
I missed the trophy wife,
Please can you help me?
I'd say to my family
If you would ever settle down and realize that it's always been me
