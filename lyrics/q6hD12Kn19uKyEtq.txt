I used to shut my door
When my mother screamed in the kitchen
I'd turn the music up
Get high and try not to listen
To every little fight
'Cause neither one was right
I swore I'd never be like them
But I was just a kid back then

The older I get
The more that I see
My parents aren't heroes
They're just like me
'Cause loving is hard
It don't always work
You just try your best
Not to get hurt
I used to be mad
But now I know
Sometimes it's better
To let someone go
It just hadn't hit me yet
The older I get

I used to wonder why
Why they could never be happy
I used to close my eyes
And pray for a whole another family
Where everything was fine
One that felt like mine
I swore I'd never be like them
But I was just a kid back then

The older I get
The more that I see
My parents aren't heroes
They're just like me
'Cause loving is hard
It don't always work
You just try your best
Not to get hurt
I used to be mad
But now I know
Sometimes it's better
To let someone go
It just hadn't hit me yet
The older I get

The older I get
The more that I see
My parents aren't heroes
They're just like me
'Cause loving is hard
It don't always work
You just try your best
Not to get hurt
I used to be mad
But now I know
Sometimes it's better
To let someone go
It just hadn't hit me yet
The older I get
