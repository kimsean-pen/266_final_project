I can't undo, I can unsee, I can unchoose
I can't unchange
I can't unpack
I can't move
I cannot fake to cause no pain
What are we going to do
Me and you
I guess it's just different points of view
But I can't gain perspective when you appear so unaffected

Estranged feels strange
Estranged feels strange
Estranged feels strange
Estranged feels strange

When I knew it was a fight
I'm the one to blame
It's not the same as an argument

Estranged feels strange
Estranged feels strange

Now I can't relate
I can't feel safe
I can't stay the same
I can't even say your name
I count the days
I cannot stand this bitter taste
So, whats the problem between us two
Cuz' I can't find perspective
When I still feel so connected to you

Estranged feels strange
Estranged feels strange
Estranged feels strange
Estranged feels strange

I wish we had a fight
Or reasons to hate
That always ends with an argument

Estranged feels strange
Estranged feels strange

I can't undo, I can unsee, I can unchoose
I can't unchange
I can't unpack
I can't move
I cannot fake to cause no pain
What are we going to do
Me and you
I guess it's just different points of view
But I can't gain perspective when you appear so unaffected

Estranged feels strange
Estranged feels strange
Estranged feels strange
Estranged feels strange

I wish we had a fight
Or reasons to hate
That always ends with an argument

Estranged feels strange
Estranged feels strange
