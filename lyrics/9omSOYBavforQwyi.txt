Do we know?
Forgiven all the way now
Follow me
Until you see
There's no way out
Save me
Save her
I'm alone!

Could've been a martyr, you fool!
Failure...

I won't fear this
I want to blame to the world!
All these tears, all alone
No...

Yeah!

I won't fear this
I want to blame to the world!
All these tears, all alone
No...
All these tears, all alone
No...
No...
No hope!
