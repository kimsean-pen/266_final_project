I read your call sign, Butterfly
Thoughts of wings open wide, cast in sunlight
In my hand your bones are brittle and you burst in to flame
Untie me and let me leave

So what if I should forget to breathe?
Will white light rescue me and secure my salvation?
I can all but hope
That time will tell that this was real enough for me

Blessed with hindsight, it was clear to me
Your reckless advancements came with no guarantees
My mind's made up
we were never in love
So what's lefts absolution for the weight of our sin
so if there's no sign of the morrow our souls remain clean
