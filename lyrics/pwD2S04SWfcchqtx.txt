Finding the truth doesn't mean there's an answer
...Who would have thought?
It seems worthless
There's no end to the travesty, idiocy
It would seem I've arrived at the meeting point
'Tween then and now
A different place
The past is alive, and the future's now
I can not tolerate being held in the dark
I need to see!
I will the flames!
Expanding light from within a cube of darkness
I need to see!
I will the flames!
I found myself crawling, looking for an "out"
And made the gap
No longer closed
Anymore... 'Cause my signs are burning the veil
Killing our idols; scarring ourselves as well
Necessity
Carer/killer
We're all gonna see - we weren't prepared

We're all gonna see - we weren't prepared
Grasping the liquid glass; shaping my own sight
Stare at the sun
Absorbing death
Reach into the well; where father laid his eyes
