So you'll aim toward the sky
And you'll rise
High today, fly away
Far away, far from pain

So you'll aim toward the sky
And you'll rise
High today, fly away
Far away, far from pain

So you'll aim toward the sky
And you'll rise
High today, fly away
Far away, far from pain

So you'll aim toward the sky
And you'll rise
High today, fly away
Far away, far from pain
