Well I sharpen my teeth to take another bite
Well I burn both ends from night to night
Dance Dance Dance
Talk Talk Talk
Well the walls are so thick that I can't even walk
Dance Dance Dance
Talk Talk Talk
Well the walls are so thick that I can't even walk

Yours eyes are shallow and your glance is cold
You can't be funky if you haven't got a soul
No, you can't be funky
You can't be funky
You can't be funky if you haven't got a soul!
You can't be funky
You can't be funky
You can't be funky if you haven't got a soul!

Well I steal everything you have but always say hello
Well I lock you up tighter every place that you go
Dance Dance Dance
Talk Talk Talk
Well the walls are so thick that I can't even walk
Dance Dance Dance
Talk Talk Talk
Well the walls are so thick that I can't even walk

You can't be a lover if youve got no control
You can't be funky if you haven't got a soul
No, You can't be funky
You can't be funky
You can't be funky if you haven't got a soul!
You can't be funky
You can't be funky
You can't be funky if you haven't got a soul!

Well you can't be funky
No, you can't be funky
You can't be funky
No, you can't be funky if you haven't got a soul
