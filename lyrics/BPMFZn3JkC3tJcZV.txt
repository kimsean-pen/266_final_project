Hey, wait, babe
Wait up now
Hey babe, wait up now

I spend all day
On your mom's couch
Spend all night
But I won't chicken out
No, I won't chicken out

No doubt, babe
No doubt now
No doubt, babe
No doubt now

If we could find a space
Where we could both stretch out
Roll like Coney Island cyclones
And I won't chicken out
No, I won't chicken out

No, I won't chicken out
(I ain't messing with you)
(I ain't messing with you)
(I ain't messing with you)
