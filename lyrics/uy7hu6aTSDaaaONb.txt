You got a nerve
Giving me the cold shoulder
Giving me the twice over, that's not deserved.
We'll talk, again when you're sober
you said I've got cold, our heat has gone
I wanna be your eyes; that you can't see, what you've done
I wanna be your ears; that you can't hear, everything that's been missing

Finders keepers
No you don't keep me in line
I like secrets
Cause they keep me in line
Oh habits die hard
But I'm too young to die

I guess it's a mess
That you make your best
So why are we still laying in it
And I could barely sleep, I could barely eat
and its been three whole weeks since I heard you speak
So you're sober today, feeding months of bills to break
Oh learn your mistakes
Especially ones you've made
(I bet you're sorry)

Finders keepers
No you don't keep me in line
I like secrets
Cause they keep me in line
Oh habits die hard
But I'm too young to die

Finders keepers
The whole thing is a lie
You won't find her
Cause she's too hard to find
So my advise and only run a mile

And have another drink
And then think this one over
You'll dig yourself a grave, everyday, when you're sober
You see, what I mean, at your best interest your all over... me
I could never be what you need.

Finders keepers
No you don't keep me in line
I like secrets
Cause they keep me in line
Oh habits die hard
But I'm too young to die

Finders keepers
The whole thing is a lie
You won't find her
Cause she's too hard to find
So my advise and only run a mile
And I bet, you guess, me right
(you guess me, yes, you guessed me right)
I bet you guess me right.
