Your way
I'm trying to understand, these days
I need to know if you're feeling it or I'm wasting my time
Your way, or mine

You spent every second with him
You're taking what you're giving
Your mother don't approve of the way that you've been living
She says he puts you through it you shouldn't let him do it
And if there is a voice in your head don't listen to it

My mind is open wide I think of it a thousand times
That empty space left in my bed from when you stayed the night
We were fucked up but you still made sure I slept on my side
I still wake up wishing you're there when I open my eyes

Your way
I'm trying to understand, these days
I need to know if you're feeling it or I'm wasting my time

You spend every second with him
You're taking what you're giving
Your mother don't approve of the way that you've been living
She says he puts you through it (My mind is open wide)
You shouldn't let him do it (I think of it a thousand times)
And if there is a voice in your head (There ain't a space left in my)
Don't listen to it

Your way

I need to know if you're feeling it or I'm wasting my time
Your way
