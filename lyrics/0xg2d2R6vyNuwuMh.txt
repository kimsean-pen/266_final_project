When you walk without ease
On these streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
It lasted 20 years, 7 months and 27 days
And I know alone that I never, ever oh
Had no one ever

Now I'm outside your house
I'm alone
And I'm outside your house
I hate to intrude

Oh, I'm alone, I'm alone
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone

And I never, never oh
Had no one ever
I never had no one ever
I never had no, no one ever
Had no one never
never, no, oh
