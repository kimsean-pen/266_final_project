I know that you don't wanna lie
It's just the demon in your mind
It's just the liar in your smile
It's just the pressure all the time
It's just so hard to fucking fight
When all you feel is pain inside
It's just so hard to fucking live
When all you wanna do is die

Lying in the mud
Dying in the mud

The chain never breaks
A servant to your broken brain
The cycle never gives in
The devil holds your head a slave

You're stuck

Living in the mud
Dying in the mud

You've lost the only things you love
Living dying in the mud
