You don't need a baby
You need to go crazy
You need to meet god

Put it in a painting
A picture of it raining, a symbol of us

Double double dare
You pissed off your parents
Now your car

Gonna take care
It's yours, not our hair
And so we have fun

These voices attacking my head
Distracting me from what I knew
I should have said
But I got a shred of dedication
Maybe some desperation
We're all having fun

Hack, slash, braid and cut
Twist, curl and tease the tuft
Blow it out and spray the stuff
Slick it back and fluff it up

Hair song
It's a great one to get ready to
Have your friend do your make up fool
Catch up with a dear loved one
You can make it hard or you can make it fun

Blow it up, blow it up now
Grow it up, grow it up

Forget what they say about me
I'm in there where they can't touch me

Right now ain't no one above me
All my faithful children love me

Will I leave my woes behind?
Where I go to burn my time
It's the brightest I can shine
In this world I breathe divine

You don't need a baby
You need to go crazy
You need to meet god

Put it in a painting
A picture of it raining, a symbol of us

Double double dare
You pissed off your parents
Now your car

Gonna take care
It's yours, not our hair
So we have fun

Hack, slash, braid and cut
Twist, curl and tease the tuft
Blow it out and spray the stuff
Slick it back and fluff it up

Hair song
It's a great one to get ready to
Have your friend do your make up fool
Catch up with a dear loved one
You can make it hard
Or you can make it fun
