You're my best girl
You're my best
You're my best girl
You're my best
You're my best girl
You're my best
You're my best girl
You're my best
You can try your best
But it won't work
You can try your best
But it won't work
Spend your gold here
But it won't work
Spend your coins dear
But it won't work
You're my best girl
You're my best
You're my best girl
You're my best
Give my best to
Sweet Little Jane
Squeeze that Lemon
Into my brain
Into my brain
Ahh
You're my best girl
You're my best
You're my best girl
You're my best
