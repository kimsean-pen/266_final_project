I've been watching you
You've been hurting too
You give all your love
nothing left to show.
I have been there too
Alone in my despair
Watching life go by
No one whom to share
Boy you got it bad
But I got something good
I will treat you good in every way yeah
You will never feel alone
My touch is such a rush
It oh oh overflows.

I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for
I will give to you
The love you seek and more
I'll get to you the love you seek and more
(you're what I'm waiting for)
I will give to you
The love you seek and more
(you're all I really need)
I will get to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for
I'll get to you the love you seek and more

Baby here we are standing face to face
Just the two of us locked in your embrace
Now I got it bad but you got something good
Won't you treat me good in every way, yeah
Are you ready
I can feel your passion and your love
It oh ohhh overflows

I'll get to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for
I'll get to you the love you seek and more
