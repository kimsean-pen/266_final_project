Ok, Ok I will admit it
Since you double dared me to
You got my mind doing summersaults
I swear it is the truth
You got me flipping back and forth
Over what I should and shouldn't do

Uh oh
Uh oh

What are we going to do
It's like a magnet's come between me and you
And there's no tearing us apart
People gonna talk
Well anybody there'd a seen us
Mind under body vs. head over heart

(Try Try Try)
Try as I may there's no controllin'
(Oh, oh)
You got me rollin'
(Can't stop)
I can't stop rollin'

(Why Why Why)
Why spin your wheel when I want to own it
(Oh, oh)
You got me rollin'
(Can't stop)
I can't stop rollin'
Rollin'

Even when I look the other way the feeling gets stronger
Then I can explain
And when I'm breathing to keep calmer
It's like I'm wrestling a hurricane
When I fan myself to cool me down
It's like conjuring a flame

Uh oh
Uh oh

And like a roller coaster
We go up and we go down
And like a roller coaster
You make me scream
(whooo)
Slide into me closer
The time is right here and it's now
The waiting is over
You know what I mean

(Try Try Try)
Try as I may there's no controllin'
(Oh, oh)
You got me rollin'
(Can't stop)
I can't stop rollin'

(Why Why Why)
Why spin your wheel when I want to own it
(Oh, oh)
You got me rollin'
(Can't stop)
I can't stop rollin'
Rollin'

Uh oh
Uh oh

And like a roller coaster
We go up and we go down
And like a roller coaster
You make me scream
(whooo)
Slide into me closer
The time is right here and it's now
The waiting is over
You know what I mean

The waiting is over
You know what I mean

The waiting is over
You know what I mean

(Try Try Try)
Try as I may there's no controllin'
(Oh, oh)
You got me rollin'
(Can't stop)
I can't stop rollin'

(Why Why Why)
Tell me why spin your wheel when I want to own it
(Oh, oh)
You got me rollin'
(Can't stop)
I can't stop rollin'
Rollin'

Rollin'...

You got me...

No matter what I try to do baby
When ever I'm with you baby
No ifs and or buts baby
'cause I can't stop rollin'

No matter what I try to do baby
When ever I'm with you baby
No ifs and or buts baby
'cause I can't stop rollin'

People gonna talk...

Let's give 'em something to talk about baby.
