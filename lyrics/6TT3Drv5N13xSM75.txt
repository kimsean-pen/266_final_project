Opening verse is sung in Czech and spoken again in Swedish

An inkling! We brace with guarded gasps!
What have we seen in the cold dim brook?
each wake is a facet of a greater truth!

The blood breaks at curious shores
like scabs it laps and clots
this blood is syphilitic
it is rife with consumption

ever is the wanting
ulcers in the stomach lining
boil, expand and suppurate
gangrenous it splits and spills!

evacuates its bowels
ruinous the tide will bloat
will ripple out and devastate
and all is beleaguered by

the Crown of red
tremendous stain
the Carrion Man
erect again

————

Rains vent
winds wrath
the naked
elemental bows

in supplication
to our will
In the cleaved lands

idle
stone dormant
sands and
sleeping glades

will be shook to
weakling roots
the gored earth
torn in twain

interspersed verse -
to the altar
and lay amongst
the trinkets
and mandibles
entanglements
geometries and
shrouded notions
of half truths
and potent remedies//

A tragedy of talismans
and dismal dunces
rattle on the field of play
with stuttering tenacity

our hidden eyes watch
these souls crawl in the faults
between fossil and foil
of old tombs exposed

lick the earth with salted words
and leave the mark upon
the lines perceived as stigmata
disgraceful prediction
no life will dare to cross it
the salts amongst each grain
for now we make partitions
between us and suffering

sprigs of herb
motes of pummelled char
thrown about in curving cues
to signify each character

gurning mouths filled with tells
each flinch speaks of ambition
excommunication

our words are sired
by prophetic squalls
tormented eloquence
caught on insistent winds

come hither epiphany
from salient shards in eyes
fleeting light bejewelled
in iris folds, the peaks and troughs

of the wanderer whose might is fair
naive and brave of meat so rare
shall slake the thirst for blood
tempt them on from safeties clutch

viridian soft and succulent
Into the dry and brittle harbour
the carcass splints forever jarring
come one and all into us

coven bleed within the well
and clot to dam their veins
eyes bound, to shirk all sunlight
ears blocked to muffle nuisance

pluck ligaments of cause
to feel each taught thread with
nimble minds, place with purpose
forage amongst their organs
to sway young minds

our fingers thread
through epidermis
And bestill all beating hearts
Bestill all beating hearts

tension sought in the crooked husks
fools of whim and the pawns that fend
off the self righteous blight of their
knuckles sore as we kneed the fates
to the waining gods of the sickly cities
when glib smiles stretch to show yellow teeth
if the petals fall in the fertile days
send a single shard of the wilful balm
in the hope of sopor, in the hope of sopor

wither stubborn sun, under sulphurous glare
but will not die by its sundering stare
gather up the strength to fly further from the bosom
the ice will sure your footing far from icy steppe

you are no pretender,
no pale and dull witted thing
our hands never falter,
each digit is divined

go to them
know their might!

wrench wide the
mouth clenched!
hasten harbinger
of the wrathful forest!

rains vent,
winds wrath
the naked
elemental bows
