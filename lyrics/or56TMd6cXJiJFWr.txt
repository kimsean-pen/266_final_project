You've got to walk that walk
You've got to talk that talk
You've got to be that girl
In the diamond world
C'mon cut me so fast

Pirate love
Is what I'm looking for
Pirate love
Is what I'm wanting for
I never ever
needed it so bad
Yeah!

Well the blood's running cold, ain't it
All the mommies are praying
Little girls are saying 'no'
And big girls always want more

Pirate love
Is what I'm looking for
Pirate love
Is what I'm wanting for
I never ever
needed it so bad
Yeah!

Well I'm locked in all these getups
Everybody seems too cruel
I can't tell who's who
Without a bag of voodoo

Pirate love
Is what I'm looking for
Pirate love
Is what I'm wanting for
I never ever
needed it so fast
Fast!
Fast!

Pirate love
Is what I'm looking for
Pirate love
Is what I'm wanting for
I never ever
needed it so bad
Yeah!
