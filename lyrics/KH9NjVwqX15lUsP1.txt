Falling on the deafest ears
But I know you hear my tears
Crying to the blindest eyes
But I know you see the lies

That's you, oh lord
You got more bones than a graveyard
It's true, oh lord
There's more love in a dead man's arms

(Dead man's arms, dead man's arms)
(Dead man's arms, dead man's arms)

So blame it on the down below
Take it from the weakest soul
Bury all your sorrow
Till the dead don't seem so cold

That's you, oh lord
You got more bones than a graveyard
It's true, oh lord
There's more love in a dead man's arms

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Oh lord
You got more bones than a graveyard
It's true, oh lord
There's more love in a dead man's arms

(Dead man's arms, dead man's arms)
There's more love in a dead man's arms
(Dead man's arms, dead man's arms)

Maybe it's built of stone
Maybe it's dark as coal
It used to be a heart, I'm told
But a heart needs blood to love

You know it's true, oh lord
You got more ghosts than a graveyard
That's you, oh lord
There's more love in a dead man's arms

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Oh lord
You got more bones than a graveyard
It's true, oh lord
There's more love in a dead man's arms

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

There's more love in a dead man's arms
Oh oh
There's more love in a dead man's arms
Oh oh

It's you, oh lord
You got more bones than a graveyard
It's you, oh lord
There's more love in a dead man's arms

(Dead man's arms, dead man's arms)
There's more love in a dead man's arms
(Dead man's arms, dead man's arms)
Oh Lord
There's more love in a dead man's arms
