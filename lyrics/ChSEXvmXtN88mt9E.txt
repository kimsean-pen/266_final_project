I had a woman, she had me too
She was so dirty, convincing you
She was so loaded
It mesmerized me
I had to follow
Her black horizon

No I will not kill for a love again
No I will not kill for a love again

She had precision, a perfect view
Clear eyed could change us, seducing you
You were so little, the way she moved
The perfect sniper, 100 proof

She took us to the killing field...

It's just a heart that's drifting
Is this your love that's drifting

There was a city
That we all knew
She stolve it's freedom
and then she flew
A broken angel
Inside the room
And all the children
Convincing you

No I will not kill for a love again
No I will not kill for a love again
It's just your heart she's beating
Is this your life she's stripping
Is this your love that's drifting
