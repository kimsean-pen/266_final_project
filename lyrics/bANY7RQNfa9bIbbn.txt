I feel like losing at the end of the day
When I'm looking so sad
Yeah I'm pissed and loose
But I cannot play the games
And it makes me so mad

I'm losing what I'm doing
And I don't think I like living this way
I'm new here but I'm through here
And a part of me that love it when you're away

Tell me it's enough
I'm thinking that it's enough
And I don't know what else I can do
And I could give it up
I'm thinking of giving up
Did it feel like compliment for you

No fear collecting little vixen to play
When I'm looking so sad, oh
But I'm sick of doing things
Enough is not enough
It's never you who's giving in, no

I'm losing what I'm doing
And I don't think I like living this way
I'm new here but I'm through here
And a part of me that love it when you're away

Tell me it's enough
I'm thinking that it's enough
And I don't know what else I can do
And I could give it up
I'm thinking of giving up
Did it feel like compliment for you

Tell me it's enough
I'm thinking that it's enough
And I don't know what else I can do
And I could give it up
I'm thinking of giving up
Did it feel like compliment for you

Tell me it's enough
I'm thinking that it's enough
And I don't know what else I can do
And I could give it up
I'm thinking of giving up
Did it feel like compliment for you

Tell me it's enough
I'm thinking that it's enough
And I don't know what else I can do
And I could give it up
I'm thinking of giving up
Did it feel like compliment for you

(Did it feel like compliment for you)
