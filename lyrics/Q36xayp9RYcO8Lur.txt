Seed, gotta let it grow, why you gotta watch when I let it feed?
Better look into the mirror for the face you hide away, everyday
But I don't give a fuck
I let it roll
I smoke the old
Gotta run, gotta rend, gotta maim, gotta make it through another maze
Stay Away!

Please, wring the blood from my hands
Don't pretend that you understand me
I don't even want you looking at me
Motherfucker, Get Inside!

Get Inside
Get Inside
(Motherfucker)
Get Inside
Get Inside
(Motherfucker)
Get Inside
Get Inside
(Motherfucker)
Get Inside
Get Inside

Christ, have you seen this guy? Make you sick
Gonna peel away all the impurities
'Cause all you wanna do is keep curin' me
But I don't give a fuck If you'll help me once
You'll be mopping up blood and guts and all the shit when I'm done
Isn't this fun? Give me a gun and I'll tell you all the secrets I hide
Before I run!

Please wring the blood from my hands
Don't pretend that you understand me
I don't even want you looking at me
Motherfucker, Get Inside!

Get Inside
Get Inside
(Motherfucker)
Get Inside
Get Inside
(Motherfucker)
Get Inside
Get Inside
(Motherfucker)
Get Inside
Get Inside

Maybe if you look away, I can slip away, gotta get away
Run motherfucker, run!
Right now I stare at shit
I'm a heretic, but I'll never give you none of it
Tied up in the back of the lab, laid on the slab, got the gift of gab
what you want from me?
I don't even know I got a damn disease, but I Know you wanna kill me!

Please, wring the blood from my hands
Don't pretend that you understand me
I don't even want you looking at me
Motherfucker, Get Inside!

Get Inside
Get Inside
(Motherfucker)
Get Inside
Get Inside
(Motherfucker)
Get Inside
Get Inside
(Motherfucker)
Get Inside
