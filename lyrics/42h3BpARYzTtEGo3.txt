Oh oh oh oh
Where were you when i needed you
Well you could not be found
What can i do, oh i believed in you

You're running me around
Well you can take it as a warning
Or take it anyway you like
It's the lightning, not the thunder

You never know where it's gonna strike
Our love's in jeopardy, baby, ooh
Our love's in jeopardy, baby, ooh
Don't be cute, don't be funny now

It's later than you think
Oh what's the use, save your money now
It's hanging on the brink
Don't let go while i'm hanging on

'Cause i've been hanging on so long
It's so hard to be all alone
I know you're not that strong, yeah, yeah
Our love's in jeopardy, baby, ooh

Our love's in jeopardy, baby, ooh
Don't let go while i'm hanging on
'Cause i've been hanging on so long
It's so hard to be all alone

I know you're not that strong, yeah, yeah
Our love's in jeopardy, baby, ooh
Our love's in jeopardy, baby, ooh
Our love's in jeopardy, jeopardy, baby, ooh
Our love's in jeopardy, jeopardy, baby, ooh
Love in jeopardy, baby
