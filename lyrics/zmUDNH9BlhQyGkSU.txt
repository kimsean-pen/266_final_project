Monster Hospital, can you please release me?
You hold my hands down, I've been bad
You hold my arms down, I've been bad
I've been bad, I've been bad

I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won
I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won

Monster movie
Daddy war bucks up against Bobby Fuller
And he beat him hands down, lead in his head
They put a little lead in, in his head

I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won
I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won't stop for the love of God
I fought the war, I fought the war but the war won

I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won't stop for the love of God
I fought the war, I fought the war
But the war won't stop for the love of God

I fought the war, I fought the war
But the war won't stop for the love of God
I fought the war, I fought the war
But the war won

I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won't stop for the love of God
I fought the war, I fought the war
But the war won't stop for the love of God

I fought the war, I fought the war
But the war won
