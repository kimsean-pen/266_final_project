Give me shelter, shelter
I can face the day
Then I'll just fade away
Give me shelter
Give me shelter
Sleep comes slowly
The fire starts to die
Then you open up your eyes

Faces in the window
Noises in the night
Faces in the window
Hiding from the light
Faces in the window

We are evil
And we are all divine
Creations of the mind
We are pleasure
I see clearly
Who's behind the wall
Yes, I can see us all

We're faces in the window
Noises in the night
Faces in the window
Hiding from the light
Faces in the window

Give me shelter, shelter, shelter
Give me shelter, shelter, shelter

Faces in the window
Noices in the night
Faces in the window
Hiding from the light

Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window

When the fire starts to die
And you open up your eyes
There they are in the window
Faces in the window

We are evil and divine
Just creations of the mind
And faces in the window
Faces in the window

Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
