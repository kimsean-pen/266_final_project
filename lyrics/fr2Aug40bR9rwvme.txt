Truth is the devil's work
A blade won't slow the heart
Of the enemy
We are not willing to see

In order to starve the monster
We must behead the beast
In order to starve the monster
We must behead...

The churches and jails
The churches and jails

Truth is the devil's work
A blade won't slow the heart
Of the enemy
We are not willing to see

In order to starve the monster
We must behead the beast
In order to starve the monster
We must behead...

The churches and jails
The churches and jails

The churches and jails
The churches and jails
The churches and jails
The churches and jails
The churches and jails
We have to behead the beast

Truth is the devil's work
Truth is the devil's work
