Burning of the Defeated
Dragging the Fettered Rebels
To the Block of Slaughter

Decapitated Headless
Naked and Bound
Captives Adorn my Shield

Arms Tied Behind Their Backs
Lying Bound in Agony
Fiends Hold Them with Ropes
Awaiting Beheadment and Mutilation

With Contempt for the Vanquished
We Exterminate the Dwellers
Of the Eastern Desert

Amenhiu!
They Are Doomed to Slaughter

We Stab Their Bodies with Daggers
We Smash Their Skulls with Clubs
We Crush Their Bones
And Gash Their Faces
Their Necks are Broken and Severed
Their Bowels are Gored with Spears
Yeah! We Hack Off Their Limbs
And Cast the Phalluses
Into Pits of Fire

Smashing the Antiu
