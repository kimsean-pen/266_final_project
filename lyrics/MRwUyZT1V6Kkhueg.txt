Yeah, how could you be so careless? I sweat this, I swear
I think I'm losing my voice, I took no time to take care
I smashed my phone, but honestly, I feel relieved
You can't reach me, now I can exhale on my own

What were you thinking, that night was a dream?
At the top of your lungs, I've heard you scream in your sleep
And I know you don't mean a thing, I just get lost in translation, so
How much is enough gonna take? Yeah

I've got a number for you
I call it breaking, yeah
I've got a lover, baby
Don't need what you're giving me, more than what you think
Oh, love ain't love, If It ain't rough, but
You're screaming

I've said it all
I thought maybe you'd believe me, 'cause I don't
These days it's a clich√©, I know
I have no words, no words

And if I could forget you, you know I would leave
I can't help myself from feeling all this is wasted on me
And I love the rain (love!), but I can't live in a storm
I got more to go
Still learning to grow

What were you thinking, that night was a dream?
At the top of your lungs, I hear you screaming, no sleep
And I know you don't mean a thing, I just get lost in translation, so
How much is enough gonna take? Yeah
I got a lifetime to wait
Seconds can't bury me
