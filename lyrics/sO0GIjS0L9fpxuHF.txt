There's a
There's a

There is a ghost lying in my sheets
I'm not alone when I sleep
I hear the walls trying to speak
There's something haunting me
She said

There's a ghost in my bed
And I don't know if he's alive or dead
There's a ghost in my bed
"Every night I toss and turn," she said
There's a ghost in my head
She don't know if I come back like you said
There's a ghost in my head
My bed, my bed, my bed

She said; Baby, when you're gone I'm scared
She said; Baby, when you're gone I'm scared
She said; Baby, when you're gone I'm scared
And I'll never ever see her again

There is a ghost lying in my sheets

There's a ghost in my bed
Every night I toss and turn, she said
There's a ghost in my head
She don't know if I come back like you said
There's a ghost in my head
My bed, my bed, my bed

There's a ghost in my bed
There's a ghost in my bed

She said; Baby, when you're gone I'm scared
She said; Baby, when you're gone I'm scared
