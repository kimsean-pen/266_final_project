She looked cold, I said it's alright
Come with me you'll find a good fight
Take my coat and choose a cigarette
Keep on moving on with no regret

She don't like the sun
She love the rain
Let it pour on everyone
She dont want it say
She want it explained
Set the freaks on everyone

Don't get blinded by the bright lights
Come with me you'll fight the good fight
Do you feel like a melted sky
Look it up cos there's a reason why

She don't like the sun
She love the rain
Let it pour on everyone
She could have you all it's just a game
Let it play it on and on

I got a good one, I got one good
I try to get through to
I can't stop myself I'll always want you

Almost there I said hold tight
Come with me you'll fight a good fight
Hold my fingers right to the bone
Dont' want to spend the night all alone

She don't like the sun
She love the rain
Let it pour on everyone
She could make the stars give up on stage
Watch them all just sing along

I got a good one, I got one good
She said, "You're mouthy, unhealthy
But I think I would"
I try to get through to you
I try to get through to you
I try to get through to you
I can't stop myself I'll always want you
