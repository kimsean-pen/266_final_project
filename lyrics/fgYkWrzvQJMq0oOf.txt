Oh, my god, it's been ages
Look at you now
I've read about you

This place still looks the same
Down to the drunks and homeless ones
Well, you know how it is

I should be leaving
I am fine, I am fine
I shut doors and windows
And sleep for days

A familiar face without meaning
No hellos
Someone set fire to
The place I used to call my home

Soon everyone is back for Christmas break
Counting the days
And what measure do you use on your old friends?
Oh, success...

(Helvete!)
