No I can't take it anymore
I bang my head against the door
I'm going out, I, I, love it, love it (ooh, ooh, ooh)
The doctor said I need a sleep
But I go crazy counting sheep (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm going out, I, I, love it, love it

Let's get wild and make a memory

Hey ya, I wanna go out
I wanna go out, I wanna-na
Hey ya, I wanna go out
Out of my mind
Hey ya, I wanna check out
Step off of my cloud
Hey ya, I wanna go out
Out of my mind

Oh, I'm a zombie, I'm a corpse
Every day is so boring
I'm going out, I, I, love it, love it (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm jumping out the window
Smiling down at the world below
I, I, love it, love it (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Let's get wild and make a memory

Hey ya, I wanna go out
I wanna go out, I wanna-na
Hey ya, I wanna go out
Out of my mind
Hey ya, I wanna check out
Step off of my cloud
Hey ya, I wanna go out
Out of my mind

Indecisive, so fragile, so mad
Idiotic, insane
Out of my mind, out of my mind
So enlightened, but frightened and scared
So hypnotic and dazed
Out of my mind, out of my mind (hu)

I wanna, I wanna feel, like something is changing
(Some things need changing)

Hey ya, I wanna go out
I wanna go out, I wanna-na
Hey ya, I wanna go out
Out of my mind
Hey ya, I wanna check out
Step off of my cloud
Hey ya, I wanna go out
Out of my mind

Hey ya, I wanna go out
I wanna go out, I wanna-na
Hey ya, I wanna go out
Out of my mind
Hey ya, I wanna check out
Step off of my cloud
Hey ya, I wanna go out
Out of my mind
