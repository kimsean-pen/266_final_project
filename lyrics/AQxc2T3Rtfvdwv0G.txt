Sinking right into the crimson clouds
Waiting for this thing to spin me out
I'm swimming in my head
Mouth so dry, I could crack my tongue
Jaw hanging like an accordion
Let's hope nobody stares

It was a different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind

Give me a reason and I will hold your
Strawberry-flavored lightning bolt
Like everybody else
I can't reach the counter, but I feel tall
You're standing naked in your overalls, tonight
I'm someone else

It was a different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind

She knows what I bring
She tells me to say it
She knows what I bring
And that's where I'll find

A different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind

Ah, it was a different state of mind
It was a different state of mind
A different state of mind
A different state of mind
