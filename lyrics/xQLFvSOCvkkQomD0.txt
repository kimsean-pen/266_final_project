I'm such a psycho, got violent eyes
I'll make it rain down, electric skies
I tell you secrets, I tell you lies
You think I'm broken on the inside
I need to
I need to

I need to breathe in and then breathe out
Punch through the window
'm bleeding now
I tell you secrets
I tell you lies
You think I'm broken on the inside

We've played this game twice
I won't play nice
You can't take me down
Baby roll the dice
Let fate decide
I'm not losing now

I need to win
I need to win

You spin the wheel
I'll throw the knives
Head in a fever, bottles on ice
I tell you secrets, I tell you lies
You think I'm broken on the inside

We've played this game twice
I won't play nice
You can't take me down
Baby roll the dice
Let fate decide
I'm not losing now

I need to, I need to, I need
I need to, I need to, I need
I need to, I need to, need to win
I need to, I need to, I need
I need to, I need to, I need
I need to, I need to, need to win

I need to win, need to win
I need to win, win, win
Yeah, born to win

I need to, I need to, I need
I need to, I need to, I need
I need to, I need to, need to win
I need to, I need to, I need
I need to, I need to, I need
I need to, I need to, need to win
