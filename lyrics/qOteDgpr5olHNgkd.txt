Watch your words
or your words might drown you
and cure my wounds
and the light will blind you

to truly see well you must have faith
oh the righteous they can't wait
a saving grace that all we know
let us pray
let us hold on

I can't breath
I prefer to find a ceiling to this hate of mine
I can't win
I can't fight no more
I'm drowning
and I'm sick inside...
Push no more and the day will find you
Speak no truth and your ways will end you

It's alright and you must move on
Though the damage has been done
Cherish the life and the ones you hold
Can you change?
Can you go on?

I can't breath
I prefer to find a ceiling to this hate of mine
I can't win
I can't fight no more
I'm drowning
and I'm sick inside

to truly see well you must have faith
oh the righteous they can't wait
a saving grace that all we know
let us pray
let us hold on

I can't breath
I prefer to find a ceiling to this hate of mine
I can't win
I can't fight no more
I'm drowning
I'm sick inside

I can't breath...
