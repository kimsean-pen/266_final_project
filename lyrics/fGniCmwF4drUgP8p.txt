What'd you see, girl, on the love train?
I said, what'd you see, girl, on the love train now?
I said I gotta get back, girl, on the love train, oh
I said I gotta get back, girl, on the love train, oh

I saw different faces and different places
I gotta get back, girl, on the love train, oh
I saw different faces and different places
I gotta get back, girl, on the love train, oh

What'd you see, girl, on the love train?
She had different lockets with no name
Tellin' me all things all the same
I said I gotta get back, girl, on the love train

I saw different faces and different places
I gotta get back, girl, on the love train, oh

I saw different faces and different places
I gotta get back, girl, on the love train, oh
I saw different faces, different places
I gotta get back, girl, on the love train, oh

Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Aow!
