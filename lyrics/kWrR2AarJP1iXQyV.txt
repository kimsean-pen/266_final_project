Reverie

I wish that I could be a younger me

Clarity

A revelation we were meant to be

I took everything they gave me
I'm still begging for more

Call the exorcist, the hypnotist
They can't find a cure

It's goes on and on
We take, we want, we quit
And call it love

It goes on and on
I put my faith in you
A pill to crush

Sanity

I feel like I've been floating endlessly

Pray for me

'Cause I've been chasing wine with alchemy

I took everything they gave me
I'm still begging for more

Call the exorcist, the hypnotist
They can't find a cure

It's goes on and on
We take we want we quit
And call it love

It goes on and on
I put my faith in you
A pill to crush

I wanted to tell you
Youth of a godless culture
God of a youthless cult
Cult of a passing stranger
Stranger than what I thought

Pockets full of flowers
Vanilla in your eyes
Sometimes the way you love me
Makes me cry

I took everything they gave me
I'm still begging for more
A pill to crush
