Let me feels my palms around your throat
Let me see the pain of lost control
Let me hear your heart racing inside
Let me see the darkness that fight
When the night crashes down
See (No vision)
Can you believe? (Derision)
Will I fall? (Down so far)
Into the deep (It's so dark)
Ghosts will haunt my bones
So just leave me alone
Let me taste the salt within your tears
Let me swallow hope, it disappears
Let me steal the mind that makes you whole
Let me peel a layer from your soul
When the night crashes down
See (No vision)
Can you believe? (Derision)
Will I fall? (Down so far)
Into the deep (It's so dark)
Ghosts will haunt my bones
When the night crashes down
See (No vision)
Can you believe? (Derision)
Will I fall? (Down so far)
Into the deep (It's so dark)
Ghosts will haunt my bones
They won't leave me alone
In darkest night I lay awakened with
These thoughts of endless black that never quit
The tortured thoughts inside my head you see
They hide a mask of pain that's so ugly
These ghosts come haunt my bones
They won't leave me alone
From my throat the agonies emits
My demons wrestle and my thought conflict
The stench of bile, as I purge this hate
An inner struggle I can't seperate
These ghosts come haunt my bones
They won't leave me alone
Thunder cracks and dark furies sound
When the night crashes down
These ghosts come haunt my bones
They won't leave me alone
Thunder cracks and dark furies sound
When the night crashes down
When the night crashes down
When the night crashes down
