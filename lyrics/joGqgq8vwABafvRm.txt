I didn't know about those other things
I could've been there but now it's too late
But only here for one hour, you want it till it's gone
Try to find the best, I know you

I didn't know that you would leave so soon
I tried a little harder to make you smile once more
One day I'll come to find you, wherever you may be
Only time was kinder, you would still be here
