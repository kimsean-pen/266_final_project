Hey baby I'm talkin' to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never choose
Even if you try, yeah
You're bangin' your head again
'Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love, your chance to let me know

We can't go on
Just running away
If we stay any longer
We will surely never get away
Whoa, oh, anything you want we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around
Never let them shoot us down
Never
Never
Never
Never run away

Hey baby, you know it's true, why you bother lyin'?
When you know that, that you want it too
Don't you dare deny me
Now walk those legs right over here
Gimme what I'm dyin' for
One chance, one love, hold me down, then let me go

We can't go on just running away
If we wait any longer
We will surely never get away
Whoa, oh anything you want we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around
Never let them shoot us down
Never (oh)
Never (no!)
Never
Never run away

Never (no, never)
Never
Never (no, no, no, no)
Never run away

Hey baby I'm talkin' to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never, never choose
Even if you try, yeah
You're bangin' your head again
'Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love
Your chance to let me know

We can't go on
Just running away
If we stay any longer
We will surely never get away
Whoa, oh
Never
Whoa, oh
Never

We can't go on
Never
We can't go on
Never
Whoa, oh
Na, na, na, never
Whoa, oh
(Never, never) never
We can't go on (we can't go, we can't go on) never
We can't go on (we can't go, we can't go on, baby) never
Whoa, oh (na, na) never
Whoa, oh
Never (never, never, never)
