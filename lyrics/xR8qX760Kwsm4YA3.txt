We had a lot of good times
When we were together
And I thought we'd last forever, you and I

I'm for so long, I couldn't wait
To get your phone call
Dreaming 'bout you makes me feel alright

Night you called me on the phone
Said, you had to stay at home
Is there something I should know? Yeah

I was fine till 7: 05
Till she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone I'll move on
But it only would have taken 2 seconds to say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

Night after your phone call
Me and friends were hanging at the mall
I was not believin' what I saw

Oh, you're holding hands with him
And sitting closer than six inches
Hope that she's not gonna kiss him now

How can I call you friend?
You stood me up in the end
I know that it's over, yeah

I was fine till 7: 05
Till she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone I'll move on
But it only would have taken 2 seconds to say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

Don't keep telling me that you're sorry now
But let me tell you how much this hurts me too, yeah, oh

I was fine till 7: 05
Till she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone I'll move on
But it only would have taken 2 seconds to say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
I was fine till 7: 05
Till she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone I'll move on
But it only would have taken 2 seconds to say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
It only would have taken 2 seconds to say goodbye
Goodbye, oh, yeah, oh, goodbye
