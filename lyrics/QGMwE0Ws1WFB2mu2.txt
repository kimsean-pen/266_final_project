I'm not the one who started out making promises
Made my mistakes and ran away and that's my punishment
I hear the sound of all these rumors going down
Is this how you want me to be?

What can I do?
Do you want me on my knees?
What shall I give?
One hundred more apologies
What can I say?
When you can't look me in the face
I just don't know why I bother
I go taking all the blame

I never asked you to be mre than who you are
I only said, you're never there, yeah,
You seemed so far
From me
I hear the sound of all these rumors going round
So you say it's all down to you

What can I do?
Do you want me on my knees?
What shall I give?
One hundred more apologies
What can I say?
When you can't look me in the face
I just don't know why I bother
I go taking all the blame

Will this be ever like it used to?
We used to ride into the sun
Why can't things be like they used to?
You're just no fun

What can I do?
Do you want me on my knees?
What shall I give?
One hundred more apologies
What can I say?
When you can't look me in the face
I just don't know why I bother
I go taking all the blame

No, I just don't know why I bother
I go taking all the blame
