Oh lord, forget about me
I'm doing fine
Oh lord, forget about me
Let me ride
Oh lord, I've got no mind for you
I will not please
No mercy shall be given me
Down in Tennessee
Stop!

Buzzkill me
Why don't you stop?
Buzzkill

Got my boots and my jacket on
My cash and keys
Got my highs and my lows
And I come and go as I please
Good lord, I got no time for you
I gotta run
Stop!

Buzzkill me
You gotta stop
Buzzkill

Good lord, won't you forget about me
I'm getting mine
Good lord, won't you forget about me
Let me ride
Hey
Oh lord, I will not follow you
I'm in the lead
Oh lord, you will not get to me
Down in Tennessee
