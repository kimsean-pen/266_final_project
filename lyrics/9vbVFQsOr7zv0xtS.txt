I work the pen to make the ink transform
On any particular surface the pen lands on
Zaakir is hands on, what's the beef?
The Cooley High cold chief high post techniques
I drape off poetic landscapes and shapes
Illustrate the paper space off the pens that paint
Then design what have a National Geographic a magic
With tailor-made status and plus favored is automatic

Melancholy mundane so I tame the hot flame
Big rings, fat chains, and y'all quest for the same

Work for mines pay me by the hour

Hip... Hop

Yo...
Well, it's the verbal Herman Munster
The word enhancer, sick of phony mobsters controllin' the dance floor
I been in dark places, catch you when you stark naked
Your heart races as we pump you for your chart spaces
The tart taste is me bringing these hot styles through
Some of you bum a few cheers from shock value
Word power can plow through acres of cornfields
Paragraphs cut like warm steel, perform ill...
