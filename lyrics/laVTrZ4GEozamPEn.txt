Sooner or later
i'm gonna get tired
i'll look at my???
and wonder why
i gotta get away
???
and it's making my heart
forget what's mine
i tried to run away
but i can't seem to run
therer"s something in the way
and i'm too scared to run
searching the dream
and making it come
???
and i'm gonna get high
there's something in the way
it's something i have done
???
but can it be undone
i gotta run away
right back to you i run
there's something in the way
but am i even done
we're drowning in our way
we cannot see the sun
it's comming back in waves
it's feels like even???
standing here looking
???
the mirror is talking
but my face is not
we gotta run away
right back to you i run
there's something in our way
but am i even done
we're drowning in our way
we cannot see the sun
it's comming back in waves
???
