Little boy so full of joy
Wearing round glasses and short blue trousers
Jumping and skipping down by the bay
With no words to say
And I guess this is the way it ends
And there's no point in staying friends

Pink singing girl out in the bar
From home so far
Little girl out alone in the world
Going forth, showing what she's worth
And I guess this is the way it ends
And there's no point in staying friends

And I remember when you told me that you loved me
Little did I know and little did I say
You were over your head
And I hadn't had said what's true
In our heart
To create a thing called love

So I wish upon a star
And I promise I'll go far
And I close my eyes at words
And I hear a thousand songs

And I close my eyes
And I hear a thousand songs
And I wish upon a star
And I promise I'll go far

And I guess this is the way it ends
And there's no point in staying friends

And it's time to turn your screams into dreams
