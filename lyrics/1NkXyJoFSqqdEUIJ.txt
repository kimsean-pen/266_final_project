These walls around me start to bend
And I'm wither again
Intoxication, this is intoxication
I'm swerving down this road my friend
Tell me where does it end
Intoxication, this is intoxication

I've been feeling low
And I got to know
Can you pick me up?
'Cause it's so, so hard

I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
I gotta know if you're gonna save me
I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
It's so, so hard
I'm waiting on your phonecall baby
I gotta know if you're gonna save me
I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
It's so, so hard

The smoke is flowing like her hair
Breathe it in if you dare
Intoxication, is it intoxication?

I'm going down just like a pill
And I'm getting my feel
Because I hate to waste them
Intoxication

I've been feeling low
And I got to know
Can you pick me up?
'Cause it's so, so hard

I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
I gotta know if you're gonna save me
I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
It's so, so hard
I'm waiting on your phonecall baby
I gotta know if you're gonna save me
I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
It's so, so hard

Shake, shake, shaking
You got me
Shake, shake, shaking, yeah
Shake, shake, shaking
You got me
Shake, shake, shaking

I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
I gotta know if you're gonna save me
I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
It's so, so hard
I'm waiting on your phonecall baby
I gotta know if you're gonna save me
I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
It's so, so hard
