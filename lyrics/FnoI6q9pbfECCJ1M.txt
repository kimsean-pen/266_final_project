She rolled in from the west
In a summer sun dress

Hotter than the heat in July
With her wind blown hair
It just wasn't fair
The way she was blowin' my mind
Have you ever noticed
Every hurricane gets its name from a girl like this
She's a cat. five kind
Keeps you up at night

Hangin' on to the edge of a kiss
She's a beautiful mess
The kind you love to love
But what happens next

I got a feeling when the sun comes up
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
Little lee-way, little more time
Some kind of radar system
Locked in on love
I got a feeling by the time the night finds the morning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
Ain't it funny how it feels
When you're burning your wheels
Somewhere between goin' and gone
You get so lost that you can't turn it off
You give in and you just turn it on

She's a heart full of rain
Red lips like a flame
She's the girl from your favorite song

What a beautiful mess
One part angel, one part perfect, one part brick
The kind of flood you'll never forget
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
Little lee-way, little more time
Some kind of radar system

Locked in on love
I got a feeling by the time the night finds the morning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
Ooo, Yeah
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign

I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
Little lee-way, little more time
Some kind of radar system
Locked in on love!
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
Little lee-way, little more time
Some kind of radar system
Locked in on love
I got a feeling by the time the night finds the morning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
Or a storm warning
