Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one
Who is
The schizophrenic psycho yeah

Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one
Who is
The schizophrenic psycho yeah

She lays down on the fresh lawn
She can make everything magical
But she tied one on big time
And it makes me want to rewind

To back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun

Ready to go off in any minute
And you know we're gonna win again
Yeah you know we're gonna win again
Yeah you know we're gonna win again

Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one
Who is
The schizophrenic psycho yeah

Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one
Who is
The paranoid flake-oh yeah

She lays down on the sidewalk
Never very analytical
She is something simply beautiful
Reappear with youth and magical

Back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off in any minute
Yeah you know we're gonna win again

Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one
Who is
The paranoid freak-oh

I'm the one
I'm the one
Who is
The schizophrenic psycho
I'm the one
I'm the one
Who is
The schizophrenic psycho

You're the one
You're the one
Who is
The schizophrenic psycho
Back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off in any minute
And you know we're gonna win again
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one
Who is
The schizophrenic psycho yeah
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one
Who is
The paranoid flake-oh
You're the one
You're the one
Who is
The schizophrenic psycho
(Maybe I'm the one)
(Maybe I'm the one)
(Who is...)
(Who is the schizophrenic psycho)
You're the one
You're the one
Who is
The schizophrenic psycho
(Maybe I'm the one)
(Maybe I'm the one)
(Who is...)
(Who is the schizophrenic psycho)
You're the one
You're the one
Who is the schizophrenic psycho
