Please just don't play with me My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseach you
Simple things, that make you run a-way
Catch you if I can

Tears fall, down your face
The taste, is something new
Something that I know
Moving on is easiest when I am around you.

So bottle up old love,
And throw it out to sea,
Watch it away as you cry
Now a year has past
The seasons go

Please just don't play with me
My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseach you
Simple things, that make you run a-way
Catch you if I can

Waiting day to day it goes through
My lips, are sealed for her
My tongue is,
Tied to, a dream of being with you
To settle for less, is not what I prefer

Summer time, the nights are so long
The leaves fall down, and so do I into
the arms of a friend
Winter nights
My bedside is cold, for I am gone
And spring blossoms you to me

Summer time, the nights are so long
The leaves fall down, and so do I into
the arms of a friend
Winter nights
My bedside is cold, for I am gone
And spring blossoms you to me
