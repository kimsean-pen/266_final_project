Will I ever understand how anything gets done?
I tied a knot in my heart for you, thinking that's what you wanted.
I tried to make my voice sincere
(tell everyone how hard it was)
And anyway, I could never reach your ears,
Like the weight of its wings were clipped when they hovered near you.

Should I tie your arms afloat to its melody, and anchor my heart to you in hopes
I'll climb out your mouth?
I was so sure you wanted love,
How could anyone find doubt?
I tied a knot in my heart for you,
Though it's not what you wanted.

Wear your heart out
Wear your heart out
Wear your heart out

I tried to make my voice sincere
(tell everyone how hard it was)
And anyway, I could never reach your ears,
Like the weight of its wings were clipped when they hovered near you
