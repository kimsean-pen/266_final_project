Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony trying to save me

Maybe you may be the lady, lady love
I'm prayin', dreamin', livin' and thinking of

Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony trying to save me

Teach me 'bout me, tell me what you thought
I thought, you thought, I thought
Use me, drain me of all the things you want
You know girl can't be bought

Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony trying to save me
Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony trying to save me

Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony trying to save me

Maybe you might be, sweet matrimony
And wonderful into a family

Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony trying to save me
Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony trying to save me

Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony trying to save me
Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony trying to save me
