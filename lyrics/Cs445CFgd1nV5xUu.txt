i'm jealous of the rain
That falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been
I'm jealous of the rain

I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow
I'm jealous of the wind
Because I wished you the best of

All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back

Tell me all you had found
Was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

I'm jealous of the nights
That I don't spend with you
I'm wondering who you lay next to
I'm jealous of the nights

I'm jealous of the love
Love that was in here
Gone for someone else to share
I'm jealous of the love

Because I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back

Tell me all you had found
Was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

As I sink in the sand
Watch you slip through my hands

Oh, as I die here another day
Because all I do is cry behind this smile
Because I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you had found
Was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me
