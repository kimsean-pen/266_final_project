Never could believe the things you do to me
Never could believe the way you are
Every day I bless the day that you got through to me
'Cause baby, I believe that you're a star

Everyone's a winner, baby, that's the truth (yes, the truth)
Making love to you is such a thrill
Everyone's a winner, baby, that's no lie (yes, no lie)
You never fail to satisfy (satisfy)

Never could explain just what was happening to me
Just one touch of you and I'm aflame
Baby, it's amazing just how wonderful it is
That the things we like to do are just the same

Everyone's a winner, baby, that's the truth (yes, the truth)
Making love to you is such a thrill
Everyone's a winner, baby, that's no lie (yes, no lie)
You never fail to satisfy (satisfy)
Let's do it again

Oh, yeah - let's do it again

Let's do it again baby

Everyone's a winner, baby, that's the truth (yes, the truth)
Making love to you is such a thrill
Everyone's a winner, baby, that's no lie (yes, no lie)
You never fail to satisfy (satisfy)
Let's do it again

Oh, baby
Let's do it again
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
