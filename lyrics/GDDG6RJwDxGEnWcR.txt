Up in the tower behind the golden door
Down to the bottom where the engines roar
Strong wind blowing, yeah, it's starting to freeze
You can blow the rock over but you can't catch me
Up in the heavens where the satellites glow
Down to the valley where the water flows
Strong wind blowing, yeah, it's starting to freeze
You can blow the rock over but you can't catch me

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Up in the aerie where the angels sing
Down in the gallows where the hangman hangs
Strong wind blowing, yeah, it's starting to freeze
You can blow the rock over but you can't catch me
The prophets of doom have got you down on your knees
They wanna go back in time but they don't scare me

The world's speeding effortlessly through the void
But you can't feel in the street
It's only make believe
And there's nothing underneath
The girls and the boys are running free

Up in the attic where the light's still on
Down in the kitchen at the break of dawn
Strong wind blowing, yeah, it's starting to freeze
You can blow the rock over but you can't catch me
And the prophets of doom have got you down on your knees
They wanna go back in time but they don't scare me

The world's speeding effortlessly through the void
But you can't feel in the street
Oh, it's only make believe
And there's nothing underneath
The girls and the boys are running free

They're running free
They're running free
They're running free
They're running free
They're running free
They're running free
They're running free
