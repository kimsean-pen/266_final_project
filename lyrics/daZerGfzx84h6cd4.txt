Hey baby if you're feeling down
I know what's good for you all day
Are you worried what your friends see
And will it ruin your reputation loving me

'Cause I'm a dirty white boy
Yeah, a dirty white boy
A dirty white boy

Don't drive no big black car
Don't like no Hollywood movie star
You want me to be true to ya
Don't give a damn what I do to ya
I'm just a dirty white boy
Dirty white boy
Dirty white boy
Dirty white boy

Well I'm a dirty white boy
Dirty white boy
Yeah dirty white boy
Dirty white boy
Dirty white boy

I've been in trouble since I don't know when
I'm in trouble now
And I know somehow
I'll find trouble again

I'm a loner but I'm never alone
Every night I get one step closer to the danger zone
'Cause I'm a dirty white boy
Yeah dirty white boy
I'm a dirty white boy
Dirty white boy

C'mon c'mon boy
Dirty white boy
Dirty white boy
Dirty white boy
Yeah I'm a dirty white boy
Dirty white boy
Yeaaaaaaah
