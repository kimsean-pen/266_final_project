Always in my thoughts you are
Always in my dreams you are
I got your voice on tape
I got your spirit in a photograph
Always out of reach you are

Cold inside my arms you are
Simple like a child you are
I remember when you took my hand

And led me through the rain

Down inside my soul you are
The more I show the way
I feel the less I find you give a damn
The more I get to know

The less you find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent

Forgot to mention we're good friends
You thought it was the start of something beautiful? Think again.
Mother lost her looks for you
Father never wanted you
I trust to love and then
I find you never really felt the same
There's something in your heart so cruel
The more I show the way
I feel the less I find you give a damn
The more I get to know
The less you find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent
Forgot to mention we're good friends
You thought it was the start of something beautiful? Think again.
The more I show the way
I feel the less I find you give a damn
The more I get to know
The less you find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent
Forgot to mention we're good friends
You thought it was the start of something beautiful? Think again.
