The moon shook
And curled up like gentle fire
The ocean glazed
And melted wire

Voices buzzed
In spiral eyes
Stars dived
In blinding skies

Stars die
Blinding skies

Tree cracked
And mountain cried
Bridges broke
And window sighed

Cells grew up
And rivers burst
Sound obscured
And sense reversed

Stars die
Blinding skies

Idle mind
And severed soul
Silent nerves
And begging bowl

Shallow haze
To blast a way
Hyper sleep
To end the day

Stars die
Blinding skies
