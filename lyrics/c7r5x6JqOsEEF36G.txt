We used to talk about it
Until the tops of the world made me blind
And I forgot about it
'Cause I nurtured the clouds in my eyes
And all of those times I lost myself in lies
It was you I was trying to find
And though it really hurts sometime
It was always true

Maybe you and your sad blue eyes
Pull me through
Out of all these lies
Maybe you and your sad blue eyes
Pull me through
If you come tonight

And if you thought about it
If it's there in the back of your mind
And if you still remember
If you're reading my name between the lines
And if you've got an emptiness inside
We should let our worlds re-collide
And though it really hurts sometimes
It was always true

Maybe you and your sad blue eyes
Pull me through
Out of all these lies
Maybe you and your sad blue eyes
Pull me through
If you come tonight
