I remember when I was five and you were ten boy
You knew that I was shy
So you teased and made me cry
But I loved you

Then one day you came
You told me you were leaving
You gave your folks the blame
And made me cry again, when you said

"Little girl, please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Some day it will surely come
Oh, little girl, please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Some day it will surely come"
And I'm still waiting

(Oh oh oh oh)
I'm waiting
(Oh oh oh oh)
Oh still waiting
(I'm just a fool)
Oh I'm a fool
(I'm just a fool to keep waiting)
To keep waiting
(I'm just a fool)
For you
(I'm just a fool)

Oh I'm waiting
(Fool, I'm just a fool)
I'm still waiting
(I'm just a fool to keep waiting)
For love
(I'm just a fool)
For you
(I'm Just a Fool)

Then someone finally came
He told me that he loved me
I put him off with lies
He could see I had no eyes

So he left me once again alone
Like a child without her playmate
I had to face the truth
I was still in love with you, but you said

"Little girl, please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Some day it will surely come
Oh little girl, please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Some day it will surely come"
And I'm still waiting

(Oh oh oh oh)
Love has never shown his face
Since the day he walked out that door
He filled my life an empty space
Come back can't you see it's you I'm waiting for

(I'm just a fool)
Don't you know I'm waiting
(I'm just a fool to keep waiting)
Oh I'm waiting
(I'm just a fool)
For love
(I'm just a fool)
For you
(Fool, I'm just a fool)

I miss you
(I'm just a fool to keep waiting)
Oh I'm waiting
(I'm just a fool)
Come back boy
(I'm just a fool)
Come back come back

(I'm just a fool)
Come back boy
(I'm just a fool to keep waiting)
Oh I need ya
(I'm just a fool)
Oh oh and I want you
(I'm just a fool)
That's what I'm afraid to say
(Fool, I'm just a fool)

A fool
(I'm just a fool to keep waiting)
But I'm still waiting
(I'm just a fool)
For you
(I'm just a fool)
Come back boy
(I'm just a fool)
