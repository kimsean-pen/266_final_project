I see my brother he is walking in the sun
His back is bare, he carries no burden for anyone
I see the island, the silver line
Brother how you shine
And all around the light
And all around the light

Now I see my father, he's so small against the sky
The child, the tree, the shadow's on his eyes
He doesn't know who he's supposed to be
Father you are free
And all around the light
And all around the light

Now my mother she is crying on the stairs
Her hands are leaves, the light is in her hair
As she prays she thinks that no one heard
Mother you are a bird
Mother you are a bird
And all around the light
And all around the light
And all around the light
All around the light
