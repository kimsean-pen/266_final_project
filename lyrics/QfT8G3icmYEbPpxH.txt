I've been watching the sleet fade to snowfall
And then watching the snow shift to rain
When will the sky choose one or the other?
When will the silence remain?

Time moves us blind
Love me into nothingness, due east the sun
Time moves us blind
Love me into nothingness, due east the sun

Forgotten words and pinewood kindling
Built a fire that soon grew dim
My helping hands became the undoing
And I had to begin again

Time moves us blind
Love me into nothingness, due east the sun
Time moves us blind
Love me into nothingness, due east the sun

It's been a few years since I've spoken
Of quiet months I spent alone
Fumbling around that big old house, honey
Until you came along
Until you came along
