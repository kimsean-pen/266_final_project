Followed your name, into the wild, yeah, yeah
Sold you my shame, I ran a mile
I sing your lullaby, your melodies like a symphony
We burn us in, inside a fire

I just need a little mercy, mercy on me
I just need a little mercy, mercy on me
I drank your holy water, your liberty, your make-believe
I just need a little mercy, oh mercy on me

I played the game, I reconciled, well, well, well, well
I wear the blame, like a shooting tire
I sing your lullaby, your melodies like a symphony
We fold us in, when we walk the wire

I just need a little mercy, mercy on me
I just need a little mercy, mercy on me
I drank your holy water, your liberty, your make-believe
I just need a little mercy, oh mercy on me

I keep burning
You keep turning me down
I keep burning
You keep turning me down

I just need a little mercy, mercy on me
I just need a little mercy, mercy on me
I drank your holy water, your liberty, your make-believe
I just need a little mercy, oh mercy on me
