I never thought I'd lead this restless life
I thought I'd wither down, a sacrifice
There's nothing I can do to make it stop
It's in my nature. It gives me chills

I never thought life would last this long
I thought I'd be found out so long ago
There's nothing I can do to make it stop
It's in my nature. It gives me chills. (Hey!)

Get off my back!(Hey!)

Is this what it's like?
Is this what it's going to be like?
