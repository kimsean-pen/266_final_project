My demons walk with me
They told me not to leave them alone
I put you on that tree
I tore your heart to pieces

You swept me off my feet
You gave your heart to me alone
I left you out at sea
I left you there to bleed

But please forgive me
Please, please forgive me

My demons waltz with me
I begged them not to leave me alone
And so your heart is free
And so your heart is free
