Will you stare, will you stare as the final curtain starts to fall
Will you watch, will you watch with closing eyes, with closing eyes
Everyone, everyone's a little worried, you know I am
But I hate to watch the days go by, watch the days go by
Another day, another time, another way for the moment, watch it for a sign...

Well I don't know, but I'm pretty sure that I want to shoot it in the back

As the days go by, I'm stepping on them all like ants
I've seen the way that they look at you
Maybe you, or maybe not a guess, we'll know it after a while
I'm wondering just how this will stop, how's it gonna stop
Another day, another time, another way for the moment, watch it for a sign...
when to be mine
