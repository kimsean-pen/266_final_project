Oh heart of steel, don't kill thy song
That sings so we, can heal the harm inside
Don't leave me stranded, don't leave me alone
Don't me leave me dying, without a lover to hold

Oh my heart, don't break the promise
Every time I pay the price
For a heart that can't be broken, oh
Oh heart of steel, you reel me in
Oh heart of steel, I can't let you win

Don't run, don't hide
Don't fight when I finally find
A hand to hold, a song that clings with mine
Don't leave me stranded, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me dying, with out a lover to hold

Oh my heart, don't break the promise
Every time I pay the price
For a heart that can't be broken, oh
Oh heart of steel, you reel me in
Oh heart of steel, I can't let you win

Every night I feel you burning
Every night I hear you calling
Every night it's only you and I

Oh heart, don't break the promise
Every time I pay the price
For a heart that can't be broken, oh
Oh heart of steel, you reel me in
Oh heart of steel, I can't let you win
Oh heart of steel, you reel me in
Oh heart of steel, I can't let you win
