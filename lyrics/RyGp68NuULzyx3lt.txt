Why don't you kill yourself?
Slit your wrists.
Slit the right one, now the left.

As a symbol for our end,
Hang yourself in the stairs.

Throw yourself in front of an eighteen wheel semi-truck.

Try to 'stick your pencils' up your nose and smashing it into a table.

Take a shotgun and blow out your brain.
You're not using it anyway.

People don't care.
This is how life goes.

Take a heroin overdose.
Your death is your extasy and it beats lusting for me.

Why don't you kill yourself?
Slit your wrists.

Hang yourself in the stairs.

Throw yourself in front of a eighteen wheel semi-truck.

Try to 'stick your pencils' up your nose and smashing it into a table.

Take a shotgun and blow out your brain.
You're not using it anyway.

People don't care.
This is how life goes.
