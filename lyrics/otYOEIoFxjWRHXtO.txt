Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough

They say, "What you contribute to my consciousness?"
Voices feelin' so ominous
I can't place a pen for you, they mark it out as anonymous
I would shift the whole continent
If it helped you 'round with some confidence
Thinkin' 'bout all the consequence
Gotta try to break, was monotonous

How could I be better?
I paid the price in full, just to clear the record
Rewound just to fast forward
On the eight track, I stole from my grandmama

Catastrophic, where the stoppin'?
Man, I wish I had a rocket
Wish I ain't feel microscopic
Wish my thoughts was telepathic, but instead I'm always babblin'
Love rappin' like it's my girlfriend, every tour is like a catfish
Just kiddin', I love you assholes

Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's a enough, that's a enough
If you think you know me now, that's a enough, that's enough

It's hard to air out in deep water
You keep callin', I ignore it
Cleared my conscience in absurd ways
I do the things you hate, I'm changin' every day

I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know where the party at)
I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know when we leavin', boo)
I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know where the party at)
I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know when we leavin', boo)

Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's a enough, that's a enough
If you think you know me now, that's a enough, that's a enough
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
