Peaceful songs
We'll get along
If we lead 'em together in the armory
On my knees
My head on your queasy stomach
Can not keep my chin up

I woke to sweats in the night
Strange sensation to feel alive
I find it so hard to tell you
I'm afraid to forget the smell of you

Wizard with a wand
Competing with the lightning
Coward and also a king
And a man of oil

Floating logs on the dark stream
Move me unlike apologies I'm texting
Broken limbs filled with smooth snakeskin
On a Ferris wheel far from cash, love

You've got to have the tough guts
So you're hung like a human
And watch the young nuts grow
I find it so hard to hear you
Say you think that I never hear you

Wizard with a wand
Competing with the lightning
Coward and also a king
And a man of oil

I woke to sweats in the night
Strange sensation to be alive
I find it so hard to tell you
I'm afraid to forget the smell of you

Wizard with a wand
Competing with the lightning
Coward and also a king
And a man of oil
