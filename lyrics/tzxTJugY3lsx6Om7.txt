On my knees, all my life I've been sold a chase
Hustling hope for dollars, try cope a day (a day)
Under condition
We on our way to the top
We got the world at our fingers
We make the penny drop
Gotta get in and get outta the gate
I won't stop till I wake
I'll say it loud till I mean it
Talk like I be the Messiah
When I'm on top
I'm on top
I'm on top of the world
See me run
See me run
See me run with the girls
I'm on top
I'm on top
I'm on top of the world
Need a break, then I'll take
To top of the world
On my knees, all my life I've been sold a chase
Hustling hope for dollars, try cope a day (a day)
Euphoria
Mystery like a new treasure
We go so good together
Search all my life to find better
But I won't hold my breath
I'll just fill up and deliver
They got attention deficit
Wait for the good lord to visit
(Mary, Mary)
All my life turned to dust
No one knew who to trust
Had a chance for a good life
See me on tele
See me on billboards and banners
See me white picket fences
Now watch me build up my palace
Now out on the run
You'll see me gathering martyrs
I won't forget where I started when we would
(Pray from the gutters)
'Cause I'm on top
I'm on top
I'm on top of the world
Send me up
Send me up
With diamonds and pearls
I'm on top
I'm on top
I'm on top of the world
Then they can talk, they can talk
But I got the good word
And it's crazy, undefined, brand new
It's amazing, I got high on a view
But tonight, I'm feeling tired and alone
Dear Lord, I hope we didn't go wrong
I think I'm winning
Feel like I might
Feels like I'm in it
Feel like a god
I'm in demand
They're on my time
One in a million
Fought a good fight
On my knees, all my life I've been sold a chase
Hustling hope for dollars, try cope a day (a day)
We prayed from the gutters
Like martyrs we followed you
Prayed from the gutters
Like martyrs we followed you
Yeah I'm on top
I'm on top
I'm top of the world
See me run
See me run
See me shout what I heard
I'm gonna shine
I'm a shrine
From the top of the world
(Pray from the gutters, like martyrs, we followed you)
On my knees, all my life I've been sold a chase
Hustling hope for dollars, try cope a day (a day)
Uphill I'm winning
Not concerned if I'm cheating
They built me up to be beaten
They built me up to be beaten
