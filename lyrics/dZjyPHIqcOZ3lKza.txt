If I seem distant
Baby I am
Words are like scissors in your hands
And there's no script to follow
So I just close my eyes
That way it won't hurt so much
When we say goodbye

I feel just like an actress
Up on the stage
I can't believe
What I'm hearing myself say
And the porch light is my spotlight
So I play along with this life
That way it won't hurt so much
When we say goodbye

Did you ever love me?
Does it even matter?
Did you even notice the whole world shatter?
I just want to hold you 'til you know I'm sorry
But I just keep it all inside
That way it won't hurt so much
When we say goodbye

My heart feels like a circus
It's to much to take in
It's hard to lose loveAs the sky breaks into a beautiful sunrise, may God open the heavens to shower you lots of love and happiness to make your day a meaningful one. Good Morning!
But you were my best friend

So I walk this high wire
Alone... tonight
That way it won't hurt so much
When we say goodbye

That way it won't hurt so much
When we say goodbye
