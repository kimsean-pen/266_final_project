Trapped in a cage
Tryin' to break away
It's always the same story

You wanna be loved
You wanna be strong enough
We're sharin' the same story

If you're lookin' for a sign
Some help to ease your mind
It's all around us, all around
All around us, all around
If you're wishin' for a change

Let the love be great again
It's all around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around

When you open your eyes
Look at the world around
Isn't it worth your while?

I see the way you wanna be
I feel like you and I believe
We can write our own story

If you're lookin' for a sign
Some help to ease your mind
It's all around us, all around
All around us, all around
If you're wishin' for a change
Let the love be great again
It's all around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around

If you're lookin' for a sign
Some help to ease your mind
It's all around us, all around
All around us, all around
If you're wishin' for a change
Let the love be great again
It's all around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around
All around us, all around
