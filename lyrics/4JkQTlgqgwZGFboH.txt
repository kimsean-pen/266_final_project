You drove me all the way up here
cause you could tell that I was a mess
I wasn't going to make it to dinner
And I shouldn't be calling again
You drove me all the way back

I circled the airport a hundred times
and tried to hide the fact that I was crying
I came in on the red eye
That's why I look like this
There comes a day when you rectify
who you are with who you want to be with
And I can't make the two things co-exist

So don't let me cave in

You drove me all the way up here
cause you could tell that I was a mess
I wasn't going to make it to dinner
and I shouldn't be calling again
You drove me all the way up here
And asked if we could stay in bed
You still got work early tomorrow

and I've got a plane to catch
You drove me all the way back

I spent last night getting Mexican
Outside a Logan Square basement show with Evan
Chicago looked desperate
But maybe that was me
I couldn't help thinking of watching
the Sears Tower collapse as a kid
I feel like I might do the same thing

So don't let it happen to me
No don't let it happen to me!
(So let it happen to me)

You drove me all the way up here
cause you could tell that I was a mess
I wasn't going to make it to dinner
and I shouldn't be calling again
You drove me all the way up here

And asked if we could stay in bed
You still got work early tomorrow
and I've got a plane to catch
You drove me all the way back

I tried to make a life in the Midwest
but the rust belt keeps breaking promises
I can't seem to find out where my footing is
So don't (don't don't don't)
let (don't let me cave in)
Don't let me cave in
You drove me all the way up here
Cause you could tell that I was a mess
I wasn't gonna make it to dinner
I shouldn't be calling again
You drove me all up here
And asked if we could stay in bed
Cause you got work early tomorrow
And I got a plane to catch
You drove me all the way back
