Making way through blades and spears
We attack at dawn
The glory scene is near
From northern gods we're spawned

Defender's fighting sprit crack
Torching house of single god
We leave land burnt black
And bodies floating in blood

War to us is holy
We sacrifice our blood
War to us is holy
We bleed for ancient Gods

Blasting forth with rage in our war eyes
We burn with hate
Cut our way through hordes of weak christian flesh
Cast them into death
WAR!

War to us is holy
We sacrifice our blood
War to us is holy
We bleed for ancient Gods

Burn away the false and untrue ones
We make them kneel
To the only true and powerful Gods
And then we kill
WAR!
