Lights go out over my town
Back to the midnight oasis with you
Saving the world that's tough but let's give it a shot
'Til you tell me game over
Feel this chaotic connection with you

The world outside is overrated
Better hanging with you all night
When we're fighting the same fight
Dreaming the same dreams tonight
You know I won't go letting you down

There's a mountain of fire
I will meet you there
Into the dark I'm coming home
Through the mountain of fire
With glass eyes and digital water
Through the shadows I'm coming home

We're all gonna die that's just how it is
There's no escaping the future
Nobody gets what they want in this world
Even for you and me
Never felt at home in reality
Always hide behind avatars
But we're fighting the same fight
Dreaming the same dreams tonight
And you see I won't be letting you down

There's a mountain of fire
I will meet you there
Into the dark I'm coming home
Through the mountain of fire
With glass eyes and digital water
Through the shadows I'm coming home

Where did the time go
It's light at my window
What we did with it who knows
Guess the time flies when we spend each night together
Where did the time go
What we did with it who knows
Guess the time flies when we spend each night together

There's a mountain of fire
I will meet you there
Into the dark I'm coming home
Through the mountain of fire
With glass eyes and digital water
Through the shadows I'm coming home
Through the shadows I'm coming home.
