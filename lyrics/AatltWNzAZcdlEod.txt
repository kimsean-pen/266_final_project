I walk the tight rope
On my way home
You're my backbone
I know you're somewhere close behind me
I walk the fault line
In a dirt field in the springtime
I feel the wind start to remind me
Of you
And the sweet talk
On the sidewalk
It's true
All I know is

All we have is what's left today
Hearts so pure in this broken place
'Cause we are, we are, we are
Who we are, we are, we are
Lovers lost in space
Just searching for our saving grace

And I still remember
How your lips taste
On holidays
You leave in December
What can I do to make you stay?
'Cause we won't fade away
We'll find peace while others change
And I know you're somewhere close behind me

And it's true
Oh, the sweet sound in the background
It's you
All I know is

All we have is what's left today
Hearts so pure in this broken place
'Cause we are, we are, we are
Who we are, we are, we are
Lovers lost in space
Just searching for our saving grace

All we have is what's left today
Hearts so pure in this broken place
'Cause we are, we are, we are
Who we are, we are, we are
Lovers lost in space
Lovers lost in space
Just searching for our saving grace
