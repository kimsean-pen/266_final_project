You say that you're down, now
Can't find a place to rest your head
The leaves have all fallen
And your garden is dead

Turning your back now
Ain't nothing left to say
No need for tomorrow
When you can't find today

When you can't find today, oh
When you can't find today, oh

Search all you want, oh
Well you won't find it here, oh
Well the fortunes you seek, oh
They were always right here
They were always right here

Alone once again, now
Walked a mile inside your head
This movie's been played now
All is done and all is said

You're running so fast now
You can't get away
No need for tomorrow
When you can't find today

When you can't find today, oh
When you can't find today, oh

Search all you want, oh
Well you won't find it here, oh
Well the fortunes you seek, oh
They were always right here
They were always right here

When you can't find today, oh
When you can't find today, oh

Search all you want, oh
Well you won't find it here, oh
Well the fortunes you seek, oh
They were always right here, oh

Search all you want, oh
It was always right here
It was always right here
