Everything's been said
Walk among the dead
You can see my crimes
This is my design
There's no right or wrong
It's the same old song
Just keeps pounding me
Hits so hard

Hell is empty
'Cause all my demons are here
Ever so deadly
Hit so hard

Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings

My whole world built on
Bodies dead and gone
You ignored the signs
That was my design
And the loneliness
Hits so hard in this
Grey place that exists
In my mind

Hell is empty
'Cause all my demons are here
Ever so deadly
Hit so hard

Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings

I ask you why, why fight everything?
Why can't you accept it?
You can never stop it
And I don't want to try
A weak half measured lie
I'd rather see it die
I'd rather see it die
I showed you why, why fight everything?
Not what you expected?
Your dystopian epic
Of memories are a lie
I don't have to try
Unfold your wings and fly
I'd rather see it die
I'd rather see it die

I showed you why, why fight everything?
Not what you expected?
Your dystopian epic
Of memories are a lie
I don't have to try
Unfold your wings and fly
I'd rather see it die
I'd rather see it die

Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings

I show you
I ask you
I show you
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming (I ask you)
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings (I show you)
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming (I ask you)
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
