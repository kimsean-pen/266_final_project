Are you alone
Can you talk to an old friend?
Right or wrong
I had to hear your voice again
Unwritten law, protical, says to leave the past alone

I just wanted you to know
Sometimes driving home at night
I let your memory take control
And your sittin' by my side
I turn up the radio
Cruise down old Rt. 59
Girl it's solid gold
Well I'll let you go

I just wanted you to know

Through the vine
I heard your life has turned out well
As for mine, you know it's really hard to tell

Cause now & then what might have been
Interferes with what might be

But I just wanted you to know
Sometimes driving home at night
I let your memory take control
And your sittin' by my side
I turn up the radio
Cruise down old Rt. 59

Girl its solid gold

Well I'll let you go
I just wanted you to know

Please don't cry, or say goodbye, and I wont call you anymore

But I just wanted you to know
Sometimes driving home at night
I let your memory take control
And your sittin' by my side
I turn up the radio
Cruise down old Rt. 59
Girl it's solid gold
Well I'll let you go
I just wanted you to know
