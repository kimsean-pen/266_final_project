I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock, not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier, but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can

She's in the kitchen starin' at the window
So tired of livin' life in black and white
Right now she's missin' those technicolor kisses
When he turns down the light

But lately feelin' like a broken promise
In the mirror starin' down his doubt
There's only one thing in this world that he know
He said forever, and he'll never let her down

I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier, but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can

TV, and take out on tha coffee table
Paper dishes, pour a glass of wine
Turn down the sound and move a little closer
Here for the moment, everything is alright

I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock, not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier, but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can

Our love can move a mountain
We can, if you believe in
We, we can
Just wrap your arms around me
We can, we can

I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean (I don't wanna be)
I am a rock, not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier, but I'm here to take a stand

I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock, not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier, but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can (because we can)

Our love can move a mountain
We can, if you believe in
We, we can
Just wrap your arms around me
We can, we can
Because we can
