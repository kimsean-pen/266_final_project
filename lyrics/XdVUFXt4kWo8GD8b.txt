You swim, swim through my veins
Drown me in your reign
My desire carries no shame
My will, will harbour no pain

Wash, wash me clean
Mend my wounded seams
Cleanse my tarnished dreams

Swim, swim through my veins
Drown me in your reign

Wash, wash me clean
Mend my wounded seams
Cleanse my tarnished dreams

Drink, drink from my spell
Quench, love's drying well

Wash, wash me clean
Mend my wounded seams
Cleanse my tarnished dreams
