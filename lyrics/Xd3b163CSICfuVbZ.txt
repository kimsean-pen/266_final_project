Hey! Hey!

We kill the girls to get paid
And put the whole damn room on the edge of the blade
You'll get far, stay clean
And if the world stops believin', I'll keep believin'

That the world could make a change
And put the suicide dolls as the last ones to mate
Come hard, stay clean
And singin' songs for the damned now

Hail! Hail!

Because the king is gone
And if you don't stop believin', we'll keep believin'
You put the record on
And live the life that you're makin', shots that you're takin'

So grab the cash and run
And let the suits watch each other kill one another
It doesn't matter if the words don't mean a thing
You're gonna kiss that ring

Well, alright

Move like the wolves, keep the faith
There ain't a dry eye left in the back of the place
Is it hard, to stay clean?
And if you all keep believin', I'll keep believin'

That the world drives the saints
And put the shotgun shells in the hills it makes
So come hard, stay clean
Because they don't give a damn, now

Hail! Hail!

Because the king is gone
And if you don't stop believin', we'll keep believin'
You got your leather on
And live the life that you're makin', shots that you're takin'

It doesn't matter if the words don't mean a thing
You gotta kiss that ring

Hail, hail, 'cause the king is gone
Hail, hail, 'cause the king is gone
Hail, hail, 'cause the king is gone
Hail, hail, 'cause the king is, the king is gone

Hail! Hail! Hail!

'Cause the king is gone
And if you don't stop believin', we'll keep believin'
And get your leather on
And live the life that you're makin', shots that you're takin'

So grab the cash and run
And let the suits watch each other kill one another
It doesn't matter if the words don't mean a thing

Fist up, head down
Hail, hail to the king
