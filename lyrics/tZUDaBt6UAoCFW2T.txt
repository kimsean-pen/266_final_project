Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Everyone comes in and out
Staring like a cinema
Shut these doors (shut these doors)
You're wrapped up in a uniform
Just a cigarette away from shedding tears (shedding tears)

Screaming for someone to come
Pick you up and take the weight

Screaming for someone to come
Pick you up and take the weight

Off, off, off, off
Off, off, off, off

Can't sleep, it's just too hot
I can't sleep, I can't believe

I can't sleep, it's just too hot
I can't sleep and I can't believe

Just how far it's gone, just how far it's gone
Every day and night, every day and night
How they get along, how they get along
How they could be wrong, how they could be wrong

Wish it could be me, wish it could be me
Wish it could be me, wish it could be me
Wish it could be me, wish it could be me
Wish it could be me, wish it could be me

Money earnt and money spent
Clothes have got a hold again
You count each stare (count each stare)
The television therapy is no attempt to remedy
The new torment (new torment)

Screaming for someone to come
Pick you up and take the weight

Screaming for someone to come
Pick you up and take the weight

Off, off, off, off
Off, off, off, off

Can't sleep, it's just too hot
I can't sleep, I can't believe

I can't sleep, it's just too hot
I can't sleep and I can't believe

Just how far it's gone, just how far it's gone
Every day and night, every day and night
How they get along, how they get along
How they could be wrong, how they could be wrong

Wish it could be me, wish it could be me
Wish it could be me, wish it could be me
Wish it could be me, wish it could be me
Wish it could be me, wish it could be me

Screaming for someone to come
To pick you up and take the weight

Screaming for someone to come
To pick you up and take the weight

Screaming for

Screaming for someone to come
To pick you up and take the weight

Just how far it's gone, just how far it's gone
Every day and night, every day and night
How they get along, how they get along
How they could be wrong, how they could be wrong

Wish it could be me, wish it could be me
Wish it could be me, wish it could be me
Wish it could be me, wish it could be me
Wish it could be me, wish it could be me
