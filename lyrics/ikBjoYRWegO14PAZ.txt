Never enough
Never enough

Love, you can chase it
But it always leaves you behind
Try to escape it
But it's all that keeps you alive, oh

If I win the race, will I get the prize?
Will I see your face when I close my eyes?
When I touched the flame, felt the warning signs
Wish that I had known
Love is...

(Never enough) Going up in smoke
(Never enough) We are choking on burning love
Love is not enough
(Never enough) Yeah, we came so close
(Never enough) In the ashes of burning love
Love is not enough

(Never enough)

Dreams, become memories
And water under the bridge
We'll drown in these blankets
Tangled up in the springs, oh

If I win the race, will I get the prize?
Will I see your face when I close my eyes?
When I touched the flame, felt the warning signs
Wish that I had known
Love is...

(Never enough) Going up in smoke
(Never enough) We are choking on burning love
Love is not enough
(Never enough) Yeah, we came so close
(Never enough) In the ashes of burning love
Love is not enough

Never enough, never enough
Never enough, never enough
Never enough

If I win the race, will I get the prize?
Will you say my name, say it one more time?
It's a shaky game, when you roll the dice
Wish that I had known

(Never enough) Going up in smoke
(Never enough) We are choking on burning love
Love is not enough
(Never enough) Yeah, we came so close
(Never enough) In the ashes of burning love
Love is not enough
Never enough
Never enough, never enough
Never enough, never enough
Never enough
