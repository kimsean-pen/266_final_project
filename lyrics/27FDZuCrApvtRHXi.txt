Hold on, little girl
Show me what he's done to you
Stand up, little girl
A broken heart can't be that bad
When it's true, it's true
Fate will twist the both of you
So come on, baby, come on over
Let me be the one to show you

I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you feel it too
(Feel it too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues
(I waited on the line)
I care, just to be the next to be with you

Build up your confidence
So you can be on top for once
Wake up who cares about
Little boys that talk too much
Well I see it all, go down
Your game of love is all rained out
So come on baby, come on over
Let me be the one to hold you

I'm the one who wants to be with you
(Yes, I'm the one)
Deep inside I hope you feel it too
(You feel it too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues
(You waited on the line)
Yea, just to be the next to be with you

Why be alone when we can be together, baby?
You can make my life worthwhile
I can make you start to, smile

Well it's true, it's true
Fate will twist the both of you
So come on, baby, come on over
Let me be the one to show you

I'm the one who wants to be with you (I'm the one, the one)
Deep inside I hope you feel it too (I hope that you feel it too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues
Just to be the next to be with you
I'm the one who wants to be with you (I'm the one, the one)
Deep inside I hope you feel it too (You feel it too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues (Waited on my line)
Just to be the next to be with you
Yea, just to be the next to be with you
