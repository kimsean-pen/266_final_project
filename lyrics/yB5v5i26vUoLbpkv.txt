We have a list, it goes like this
We made a fist, it feels like this
We built a cross, all hope was lost
An albatross in semigloss
We have a list, it goes like this
We made a fist, it feels like this
We built a cross, all hope was lost
An albatross in semigloss

Fantasy Nazarence
Paint a line no one's seen
A recipe for atrophy
Misinform happily
Precipice sisophis
Paint a line with your fist
Out of phase, an empty gaze
An act of rage from happier days

When you have severed the only lines
It's a method that opens you up
When you have severed the only lines
It's a method that cuts you up

Ecstasy, plastiscene
Carving lines that no one's seen
See your face, it's wrapped in lace
It drifts away with lasting grace
Fantasy, misery
Treating wounds with wizardry
Out on your own, a jagged stone
Cuts to the bone, that's when you've know

When you have severed the only lines
It's a method that opens you up
When you have severed the only lines
It's a method that cuts you up
(It's a method that cuts you up)
(It's a method that cuts you up)
(It's a method that cuts you up)
(It's a method that cuts you up)
