Ooh ayyy ayyy ayyy
What would I do
If I didn't affect you
Merry go round and round and round, Oh
Tell me the truth I know that you're leaving
Tell me the truth I know it's you
Strange it didnt affect me
Strange it didnt affect me

Oh
Stay
A signal to your heart
we got nothing at all
What should I do?
It completely destroyed you.

Swimming around, around and drown, oh
Tell me the truth love
I know that you need me
Tell me the truth
I know it's you
Strange it didn't affect me
Strange it didn't affect me
I came to say goodbye, cause you're feeling nothing

A signal to your heart, we got nothing at all.
Cause even if you wanna try to see if there's something

I drove into your heart, we got nothing at all
I came to say goodbye, cause you're feeling nothing
A signal to your heart, we've got nothing at all
Cause even if you wanna try to see if there's something
I drove into your heart, we've got nothing at all
And I came to say goodbye, cause you're feeling nothing
I dove into your heart, we've got nothing at all.
