It's only so long that you can stare at the stars until they become a black spot with white dots.
And it would be heartbreaking to imagine you and me as two prematurely retired loose cannons.
Don't give up.
Your conscience, did you honestly think you could be satisfied.
To open the door, and then step inside.
It's an allegiance, to your wisdom.
I am taking all lines and tearing them apart.
I give up.
