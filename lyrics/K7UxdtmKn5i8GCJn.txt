Taking control of the elements
Making them mine, making them mine
Touching up all of the elements
Taking my time, taking my time
Taking control of the elements
Making them mine, making them mine
Touching up all of the elements...

Taking a hole of the present day
Pushing it all, pushing it all, pushing it
Taking control of my destiny
Making it fine, making it fine, making it
Taking a hole of the present day
Pushing it all, pushing it all, pushing it
Taking control of my destiny

Making them mine, making them mine
Touching up all of the elements
Taking my time, taking my time
Taking control of the elements
Making them mine, making them mine
Touching up all of the elements

(Making them mine)
(Taking my time)
(Making them mine)

Making them mine, making them mine
Touching up all of the elements
Taking my time, taking my time
Taking control of the elements
Making them mine, making them mine
Touching up all of the elements
Making them mine, making them mine

Taking control of the elements
Making them mine, making them mine
Touching up all of the elements
Taking my time, taking my time
Taking control of the elements
Making them mine, making them mine
Touching up all of the elements
Making it mine, making it mine
