In time, I'll be hanging on your nightstand by myself
As I sit in the dust while you lay with someone else
And I wish that you could feel how it felt
Knowing I am just an ornament on your shelf

Honestly, you never needed this
I know you've got more that you're dealing with
I'm just a burden I know that
I just wish that I could go back
Funny how everything changes
Old feelings, new faces
They say home is where you make it
Resided in you, now it's vacant

Cause every single day I wanna blame myself
I'm with you when you sleep but you're with someone else
And every single day you see my colors fade
I'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away
And I can feel the pain when you see my face
And you can close the drawer but that won't change a thing
Every single day you see my colors fade
I'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away

Now you gotta keep it all in like it's all good
But everything changed when you let me know it could
And if you could take it back I know you would
Won't throw me away when you know you should

Tell me what's real, is it all in my head?
Every night, every word that I said
They say move on but I'm better off dead
How can I sleep when I'm next to your bed?
How can you keep me confined in a frame?
Memories fading, the faces will change
But I still live in your head so I stay
Next to your bed, watch me wither away

Cause every single day I wanna blame myself
I'm with you when you sleep but you're with someone else
And every single day you see my colors fade
I'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away
And I can feel the pain when you see my face
And you can close the drawer but that won't change a thing
Every single day you see my colors fade
I'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away

All alone
In time, I'll be hanging on your nightstand by myself
And I gather dust alone on your shelf

Cause every single day I wanna blame myself
I'm with you when you're sleeping, you're with someone else
Every single day you see my colors fade
I'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away
And I can feel the pain when you see my face
And you can close the drawer but that won't change a thing
Every single day you see my colors fade
I'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away

Honestly, you never needed this
I know you've got more that you're dealing with
I'm just a burden I know that
I just wish that I could go back
Funny how everything changes
Old feelings new faces
They say home is where you make it
Resided in you, now it's vacant

Honestly, you never needed this
I know you've got more that you're dealing with
I'm just a burden I know that
I just wish that I could go back
Honestly, you never needed this
I know you've got more that you're dealing with
Honestly, you never needed this
Honestly, you never needed this
