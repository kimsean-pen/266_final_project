Good mornin', lethargy
Drink Pepsi, it's good for energy
The bath's on, smoke in the bedroom
Sore throat, and on my neck a nasty bruise
And where it came from, well I don't know
But we played last night, it was a good show

Got to play on a second rate chat show
It's nationwide deal, so we gotta go
Jeff from the company, says it'll be alright
Got an ad on KROQ and there's an in store tonight
Well I build things up, then I let them go
Got to get time share radio

Look inside America
She's alright, she's alright
(Alright)
Sitting out in the distance
But I'm not trying to make her mine
Looking for America
With its kookie nights
And suicides
TV says it's alright
'Cause everybody's hung up
On something or other

Stepping off in twenty so the driver says
"Did you should sleep tonight
But I think I'll watch videos instead"
Annie Hall leaves New York in the end
Press rewind and Woody gets her back again
And the whole world could have passed through me
But I don't know that it means much to me

Look inside America
She's alright, she's alright
(She's alright)
Sitting out in the distance
But I'm not trying to make her mine
I'm looking for America
(Looking for America)
With its kookie nights
And suicides
(It's alright)
TV says it's alright
'Cause everybody's strung out
On something or other

And the whole world could have passed through me
But I don't know that it means much to me

I could be her eyes
