You were staring at your bedroom wall
With only ghosts beside you
Somewhere out where the wind was calling

I was on my way to find you
I was on my way to find you

And you were racing like a cannonball
And roller skates and sky blue
Or in the backseat watchin' the slow rain falling

I was on my way to find you

I gotta find out who I'm meant to be
I don't believe in destiny
But with every word you swear to me
All my beliefs start caving in

Then I feel something's
About to change
So bring the lightning
Bring the fire bring the fall

I know I'll get my heart through
Got miles to go but from the day I started crawlin'

I was on my way to find you
I was on my way to find you
I was on my way every day
I was on my way to find you
