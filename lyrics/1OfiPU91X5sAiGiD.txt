You and me
Come back and I will see
Come back [?] to my arms
After this, it's more out of me
I know that you might lose control

And if I get shut down,
I don't know where I'd rather be
For me,
And if I get let down
Know I will let her back to me

You and me collecting shattered dreams
Now I'm not sure of what I've known
I suppose it's not what's meant to be
So take my lips and kiss my bones

And I. you should...
.for me, for me!
And what you want
And then I try to stay
