Drawn by the sound of that wild raving pound
No one has told me
I gotta know all about hell and below
They never told me

The quest for nexus
In your life and for all that's beyond

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees
Then I'm asking for more and the more that I wanna know
I know what I'll never know

From far away, from the state of decay
You've come to wisdom
Many've been led, into madness instead
Toll of my kingdom

The quest for nexus has brought
Many men of genius to insanity

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees
Then you're asking for more, and the more that you wanna know
You know what you'll never know

As long as you long for the whole
You can't get a part of at all
How proud would the buildings of Rome
Look without a single stone

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees
Then I'm asking for more and the more that I wanna know
I know what I'll never know

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees
Then I'm asking for more and the more that I wanna know
I know what I'll never know

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees
Then I'm asking for more and the more that I wanna know
I know what I'll never know

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees
Then I'm asking for more
