And it fills me up,
and it starts to shine.
And I see it burn when you bring me sunlight.
Is it all you need
to feel this heat,
to feel that everything is all that you dreamed?
Is it all too much?
Did you get enough?
Does it set on fire all things that you touch?
And it fills me up,
and it starts to shine.
And i see it burn when you bring me sunlight.
And it fills me up,
and it starts to shine.
And I see it burn when you bring me sunlight.
And it's all you need
to feel this heat,
to feel that everything is all that you dreamed?
Is it all too much?
Did you get enough?
Does it set on fire all things that you touch?
And it fills me up,
and it starts to shine.
And i see it burn when you bring me sunlight.
And it fills me up,
and it starts to shine.
And I see it burn when you bring me sunlight.
And it's all you need
to feel this heat,
to feel that everything is all that you dreamed?
Is it all too much?
Did you get enough?
Does it set on fire all things that you touch?
And it fills me up,
and it starts to shine.
And i see it burn when you bring me sunlight.
