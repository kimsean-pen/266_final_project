Let's buy a house
Let's buy a car
Don't worry we can put it on the card
Let's get a map
Let's hide a plane
You pick a spot, we can go somewhere insane
And if you don't know it,
Or get what you want it,
That baby you can get it for free
There's nothing to tell you
That I can't show you
Maybe you could learn it from me
I...'m livin' like a multi-millionaire
I can't explain it but I'm high
Why it feels so good the state I'm in, who cares?
I want to go faster but I'm paranoid I won't stop
I'll buy you a mountain, we can be lonely up at the top
Don't look, don't work, buy yourself some time
You can spend a million dollars, but you never made a dime
As if you don't want it, as if you don't need it,
Baby you can get it for free
And if you don't get it, as if you don't know it,
Then you're gonna earn it from me
I...'m livin' like a multi-millionaire
I can't explain it but I'm high
Can't control myself but i don't care, who cares?
I can't help myself, I just can't myself
I can't help myself, I just can't myself
I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself
I just can't help my-
I...'m livin' like a multi-millionaire
I can't explain it but I'm high
Why it feels so good the state I'm in, who cares?
I...'m livin' like a multi-millionaire
I can't explain it but I'm high
Can't control myself but I don't care, who cares?
