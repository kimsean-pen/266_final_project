It's not the way that you walk that gets me off
It's the way that you think
It's the way that you talk
And when I see something I like you know that I gotta pounce
All the things that you say, say, say
I can trust every ounce

But I can't tell this girl what's on my mind
And it seems it's getting closer all the time (Ooh girl)
I said I can't tell this girl what's on my mind (Oh no baby)
And it seems it's getting closer all the time

'Cause I went to the party and I left my
Pretty baby with Ralphie, baby and now I'm alone
Was doing much better when you weren't here
And now I'm feeling something and i know she's doing better
Without me,
Baby guess I'll go home whether that's with or without you

And I know that it's too hard
For you to play it back from the start and
No, I don't know your name
Or the frame of your mind

But I can't tell this girl what's on my mind (Ooh baby)
And it seems it's getting closer all the time (Ooh, girl)
I said I can't tell this girl what's on my mind (Oh no baby)
'Cause it seems it's getting closer all the time

'Cause I went to the party and I left my
Pretty baby with Ralphie, baby and now I'm alone
Was doing much better when you weren't here
And now I'm feeling something and i know she's doing better
Without me,
Baby guess I'll go home whether that's with or without you
