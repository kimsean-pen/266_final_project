It won't do
to dream of caramel,
to think of cinnamon
and long for you.

it won't do
to stir a deep desire,
to fan a hidden fire
that can never burn true.

i know your name,
i know your skin,
i know the way
these things begin;

but i don't know
how i would live with myself,
what i'd forgive of myself
if you don't go.

so goodbye,
sweet appetite,
no single bite
could satisfy...

i know your name,
i know your skin,
i know the way
these things begin;

but i don't know
what i would give of myself,
how i would live with myself
if you don't go.

it won't do
to dream of caramel,
to think of cinnamon
and long
for you.
