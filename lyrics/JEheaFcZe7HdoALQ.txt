I might love myself this time
I might win the fight this time
It's a light I crave but the more I take, the more dark
And the fire can't breathe in the rotten core of my heart

I cave, I crawl
Right into your arms again
I hate it all
I can't do this anymore

And I know it's gonna cost your love
And I know it's gonna cost your love

I can't watch myself this time
Hands over eyes, I'll put this time
And I won't pray for an unfilled grave
And the dirt I took for the bed I made stained my heart

I cave, I crawl
Right into your arms again
I hate it all
I can't do this anymore

And I know it's gonna cost your love
And I know it's gonna cost your love

I might love myself this time
I might win the fight

And I know it's gonna cost your love
And I know it's gonna cost your love
And I know it's gonna cost your love
And I know it's gonna cost your love
Know it's gonna cost your love
And I know it's gonna cost your love
And I know it's gonna cost your love
