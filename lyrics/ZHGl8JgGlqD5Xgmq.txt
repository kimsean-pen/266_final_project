What's up? It's Pickles, leave a message

Hey, I'm calling you back
Oh, she's been a bitch tonight

And by bitch, I mean this rain
No cabs, nowhere

So I had to put on the wig, and the heels
And the lashes, and the eairh, and take the train to the club

And you know the MTA should stand for: "Motherfuckas Touching my Ass"
So then I get to the club, looking like a drowned, harassed rat
And I'm greeted, not by Miss Rose at the door
But our friend, Johnny Five-O

Yes honey, the NYPD shut down the party
So no fee for me, I don't even know what's the tea!

So I hope you're up girl, 'cause we are all coming over
Lock the doors, lower the blinds
Fire up the smoke machine and put on your heels
'Cause I know exactly what we need

Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors, tight
Let's have a kiki, motherfucker
I'm gonna let you have it

Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Dive, turn, work
Let's have a kiki
We're gonna serve, and work, and turn, and h-h-honey

A kiki is a party, for calming all your nerves
We're spilling tea, and dishing just desserts one may deserve
And though the sun is rising, few may choose to leave
So shade that lid and we'll all bid, adieu to your ennui

Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors, tight
Let's have a kiki, motherfucker
I'm gonna let you have it

Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Dive, turn, work
Let's have a kiki
We're gonna serve, and work, and turn, and h-h-honey

Oh, what a wonderful kiki!
This kiki is marvelous

Work it girl, very liberty
Eww, you know girl, we were sitting back here just having a kiki

(Kiki, so-so, we-we, no-no)
(Kiki, so-so, we-we, no-no)
(Kiki, so-so, we-we, no-no)
(Kiki, so-so, we-we, no-no)

Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors, tight
Let's have a kiki, motherfucker
I'm gonna let you have it

Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Dive, turn, work
Let's have a kiki
We're gonna serve, and work, and turn, and h-h-honey

Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors, tight
Let's have a kiki, hunty dropper
I'm gonna let you have it

Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Boots, ten, queen
Let's have a kiki
We're gonna serve, and work, and turn, and h-h-honey
