I'm reaching out to touch you
In the middle of the night
And I don't know if I've been sleeping
But I hold my pillow tight
Are you real or are you my imagination playin games?
I can set you free You'll always be
my eternal flame
Your dreamy eyes
They just wont say good-bye

Well it must be my fate cause
I just cant escape

And the passion never dies
Oh, dreamy eyes
No matter how I cry
I just can't reach you
dreamy eyes
You're a vision of tomorrow
And a ghost from yesterday
And I'll be trying not to let you
Take my breath away
You're a summer breeze

That comes and goes
But somehow lingers on
Tell me how can I forget you
If you're never really gone
What do I have to do

To get that close to you
And your your dreamy eyes Oh
I try so hard to release you
I just keep seeing through
dreamy eyes
