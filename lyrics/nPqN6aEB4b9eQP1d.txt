Time it takes to break my heart, if only I could figure out
Time it takes to make your mark when the minute's running out
How I wish I could've turned the clocks around
But the weight of the world is pulling me down
And everything was easier when I didn't know how
Don't know what you got until you fall into the ground

Time-ime, time-ime, time-ime

Oh I can't sleep at night, every second counts
Holding the wheel so tight, are we breaking down
I never thought I would want us to turn back 'round
Are we out of time, time

Just give me more time
Just give me more time
Just give me more time

Time it takes to break my heart, just tell me how we can make it out
And look this way, we've come so far
But in your eyes you can read the doubt
And how I wish I could've seen the stars align
Oh it was never gonna happen any other time
And everything was easier when I didn't know you
You don't know what you got until it's gone into the blue

Time-ime, time-ime,
Time-ime, time-ime
(Just give me more time, just give me more time)

Oh I can't sleep at night, every second counts
Holding the wheel so tight, are we breaking down
I never thought I would want us to turn back 'round
Are we out of time, time

Just give me more time (time)
Just give me more time (time)
Just give me more time (time)
Just give me more time (time)

How I wish I could've turned the clocks around
How I wish I could've turned the clocks around
How I wish I could've turned the clocks around
How the weight of the world is pulling me down
Time-ime

Oh I can't sleep at night, every second counts
Holding the wheel so tight, are we breaking down
I never thought I would want us to turn back 'round
Are we out of time, time

Just give me more time
(Just give me time, just give me time)
Just give me more time
Just give me more time
Just give me more time
Just give me more time
