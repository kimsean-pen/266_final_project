Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

I don't feel like bein' lonely tonight
You see, I want, I want some company
And you look like you're just my type
You're the kind
You're the kind whose spirits are runnin' free

Let's take a sip of some cold, cold wine
And dance to the music nice and slow
And you won't be under any kind of pressure
You see, we'll just let,
We'll just let the evenin' flow

Come on and go with me
I'd sure like that baby
Come on over to my place
It would be so nice
It would be so good
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

You look like you're just bored to death
And you wanna get away
You wanna get away from this noisy crowd
Let's go where it's nice and quiet
Where there's nobody,
There's nobody else around
Let's sit by a cozy lit fire
And we can be each other's company
Now how does that sound to you?
You see, 'cause it sounds so good
It sounds so good to me

Come on and go with me (Would you do that baby)
Come on over to my place
Would you do that baby
Would you do that baby
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

My car's right outside, we can leave right now
That's if you're ready to go?
And I know you're just meetin' me
You see, I'd understand it
I'd understand it if you said no
But don't you do it, baby

Come on and go with me (Uhm, uhm, no)
Come on over to my place (Not tonight, no)
You see it's not far from here (I believe you)
(I believe you)
Could you just take a minute
And think about it (Oh man)
Would you just think about it, think about it yeah
(I'm thinking about it and I'm gonna have to say no)
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place (No)
(I know...)
We're sitting here
You've been sitting here for quite a long time
(Yeah, I'm slightly bored)
(I hate being bored)
See I been watching you
(I been doing the same thing)
I had my eyes on you
(I've been checkin' you out all night long)
Looks so nice, you look so sweet
(Oh thank you, that was sweet) Come and go with me
You look like you ought to be with me
(Come on over to my place)

(Yeah but what you gonna do with me?)
(That's the problem)
Seems that you feel the same way
That I do
(I think it will be pretty interesting)
It seems that you need some company too
(Hmm, oh well)

Come on and go with me
(You said your car is right out front)
(Right out front and you're gonna bring me home?)

Wonder would it be alright with you?
(Come on and go with me...)
If we left here and we went somewhere else baby
(Come on over to my place)
Somewhere where it's nice and quiet (That's nice)
(Yeah that sounds a little better than this place)
Where we can sit down by a cosy little fire
We can sip a little wine
Work things out

Come on and go with me
(Well I can't stay long)
Come on over to my place
(Maybe about an hour no more than that)
Believe me you won't be under any kind of pressure
(Please, I cannot stand pressure)
I wouldn't do that baby (Okay)
No, See I wouldn't do that baby (Would you get my coat)
Say I just wanna sit down and
Get to know you a little better
(Okay, just for a little while)
I swear you look so good to me
(Come on over to my place)
