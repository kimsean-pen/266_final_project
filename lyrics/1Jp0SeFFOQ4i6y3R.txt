Sometimes I really don't wanna have to speak my mind
'Cause I really don't wanna tell you
How I am digging you so, I can't let go
But it hurts me to my soul

To tell you every little thing that is on my mind
I can't let you know so I hide it inside
All my feelings for you don't want you to
Let it go to your head

I am mean to you sometimes
But I can't get you off my mind
So I hit you with the game
Always tryna act like your loving doesn't faze me
When the truth is that it amaze me

I know it's a big lie
'Cause you can see right through my eyes
How much I wanna hold you, give you all my loving
Baby boy, let me show you
And I really wanna get to know you

But I've been there and I've done that
And I promised never to get hurt again
(Never, no, no)
Never again, never hurt again

You drive me crazy but I promised myself
Never to get hurt again
Never again, never hurt again

I can't never ever let you seeing me this way
So I take all my feelings and I tuck them away
Fronting like I don't want you to hold me tight
So I act like I'm putting up a fight

To get your attention and make you stay around longer
So I tell you I don't like it
'Cause I know that that would make you wanna hold me tighter
I can't help myself, I really like ya

But I've been there and I've done that
And I promised never to get hurt again
Never again, never hurt again

You drive me crazy but I promised myself
Never to get hurt again
Never again, never hurt again

But I've been there and I've done that
And I promised never to get hurt again
(No, no)
Never again, never hurt again

You drive me crazy but I promised myself
Never to get hurt again
Never again, never hurt again

I don't deserve it, I can never get hurt again
Never get hurt again, never
I don't deserve it, I can never get hurt again
Never get hurt again, never, oh
And I've been there

I've been there and I've done that
And I promised never to get hurt again
(Never)
Never again, never hurt again
(No, no)

You drive me crazy but I promised myself
Never to get hurt again
(Never, no, no, no, no)
Never again, never hurt again

I've been there and I've done that
And I promised never to get hurt again
Never again
