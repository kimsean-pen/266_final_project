Therein lie the nets of iron
Snares of copper made
They offered drinks that lull to sleep
Of everlasting chains

But I changed my mortal shape
And took the form of a snake
I swam through the nets of deception
Crawled back to life again

Death bestows no wisdom
No might from death endowed
They say there's no return but I
Made my way back home

Back to life

I was there among the shadows
Who whispered, put their screams
I was transformed by the strength
Of my will to live

Death bestows no wisdom
No might from death endowed
There is no return, no way
To ever walk back home

Death bestows no wisdom
No might from death endowed
They say there's no return but I
Made my way back home

Back to life
