Don't it feel good, babe, don't if feel good, baby?

Cause it's so brand new, babe, it's so brand new, baby
Don't it feel good, babe, don't it feel good, baby?
Cause it's so brand new, babe, it's so brand new, baby!
And now here we are (here we are), in this big old empty room

Staring at each other, who's gonna make the first move?
Been doing our thing for a minute, and now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go - is all the way, ooh baby
Is that alright? Is that okay?

Girl, don't no need to be nervous
'Cause I got you all night
Don't you worry about a thing babe
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time

Clothes are not required, for what we got planned
Ooh, girl your my desire, your wish is my command
Treat you like a princess, ooh girl your so delicious
Like ice cream on a sunny day, gonna eat you before you melt away, hey hey hey
babe

Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl, no need to be nervous
'Cause I got you all night, don't you worry about a thing, no no no
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time

Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Don't it feel good, babe, don't if feel good, baby?

Cause it's so brand new, babe, it's so brand new, baby
Don't it feel good, babe, don't if feel good, baby?
Cause it's so brand new, babe, it's so brand new, baby
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
