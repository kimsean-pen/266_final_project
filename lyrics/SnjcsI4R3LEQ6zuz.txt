The whole big world is just one place
You can say its all the same
You may feel hatreds it sows
We can show its no way to go

This is the sound of our hearts, if you listen
This is a zeal from above and it can say it all
This is a fever they cant take away
This is the sound of, the sound of
The sound of our hearts!

The sound of our hearts!
The sound of our hearts!

Harmony can be achieved
Just find some way to get connected
Differences may not be wrong
They enrich the things that we know

Different faiths, different views
All we can do is to turn them in key

This is the sound of our hearts, if you listen
This is a zeal from above and it can say it all
This is a fever they cant take away
This is the sound of, the sound of, the sound

This is the sound of our hearts, if you listen
This is a zeal from above and it can say it all
This a fever they cant take away
This is the sound of, the sound of
The sound of our hearts!

The sound of our hearts!
The sound of our hearts!
