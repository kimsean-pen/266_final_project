(Truth is I thought it mattered
I thought that music mattered
But does it? bollocks!
Not compared to our people matter)

When we're winning
We'll be singing)

You're never gonna keep me down

You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

(Pissing the night away
Pissing the night away)

He drinks a whiskey drink
He drinks a vodka drink
He drinks a lager drink
He drinks a cider drink
He sings the songs that remind him of the good times
He sings the songs that remind him of the better times

(Oh Danny Boy

I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

You're never gonna keep me down

But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
