Is there life behind the neutral zone?
I'm talking about neutron, baby
Man build house and man build car
Beyond the end of my reach
To keep him safe and to carry him far
All at the cultural bar
Man build shed to keep his tools in
They're always working the land
Man build paper to write down rules in
It's always working me twice as hard
We are we are auto neutron
We are we are auto neutron
Calling my baby I'm at the throne
There's people out in the streets
Calling through time to the people of Rome
is so hard to be
One is get 'em in down
Half of those George will be
The people are ordered gonna burn your shed down
Radiator o'clock
We are we are auto neutron auto neutron
We are we are auto neutron auto neutron
Are we are we auto neutron auto neutron?
We are we are auto neutron auto neutron
