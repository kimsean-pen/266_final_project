da da da da da da da...

You're sweet like chocolate boy
Sweet like chocolate
You bring me so much joy
You're sweet like chocolate boy

Finding a way in the dark
Ain't so hard when you're close to my heart
You are there when I'm feeling alone
All I need is for you to come home

(Chorus)
You're sweet like chocolate boy
Sweet like chocolate
You bring me so much joy
You're sweet like chocolate boy

Trust is the lock, is the key
There's no doubt that your love's all for me
You are sweet on the tip of my tongue
You are warm like the rays of the sun

(Chorus)
You're sweet like chocolate boy
Sweet like chocolate
You bring me so much joy
You're sweet like chocolate boy
You're sweet like. da da da da da da...

Knowing you're there every day
Makes me high in my own special way
I am caught in the face of your love
Holding you is a gift from above

You're sweet like chocolate boy
Sweet like chocolate
You bring me so much joy
You're sweet like chocolate boy
You're sweet like. da da da.

Sweet like chocolate
Sweet like chocolate boy
