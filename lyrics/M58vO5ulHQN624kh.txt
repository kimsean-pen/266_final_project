You'll never know what it feels like til you're there
When love changes, faces appear from nowhere
Where beautiful, lovely is ugly or alone
You need me back bad, just can't be on your own

Love is not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb
Love is not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb

I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye

Now your life is broken, revolves around love
No love of yourself but the love you have lost
We said desperation is lonely despair
You don't love yourself, you've got no love to share

Love is not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb
Love is not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb

I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye
I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye

If you're gonna get me back you're gonna have to ask nicer than that
If you're gonna get me back you're gonna have to ask nicer than that
Nicer than that!
Nicer than that!
Nicer than that!
Nicer than that!

I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye
If you're gonna get me back you're gonna have to ask nicer than that
If you're gonna get me back you're gonna have to ask nicer than that
Never say goodbye!
If you're gonna get me back you're gonna have to ask nicer than that!
