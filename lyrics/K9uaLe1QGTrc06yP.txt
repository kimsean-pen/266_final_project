Know I've done wrong, left your heart torn
Is that what devils do?
Took you so long, where only fools gone
I sthe angel in you!
Now I'm rising from the crowd
Rising up to you!
Feel with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do!

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now

Can you love me again?

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I told you once again
Do this again, do this again, oh, oh!
I need to know now, know now

Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?

I need to know now, know now
