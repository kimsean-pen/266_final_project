You're like a picture
You're never gonna be the same thing again
But it's a strike of lightning
Every time you look
Every time you listen
What do the gods know
They'll never see the stars look as small as this
And you're a strike of lightning
Making up a sky for the gods to kiss with
Ahh
I wanna watch it fade into
I wanna watch it fade into black
What of the missile
It doesn't even own its own way to go
That's not the way they made you
The colors of your eyes are like a stained glass window
And when your tears fall
You never really see them when they hit he ground
But whe they do they rise back
Over to the gods raining on the god groung
Ahh
I wanna watch it fade into
I wanna watch it fade into
I wanna watch it fade into
I wanna watch it fade into black
