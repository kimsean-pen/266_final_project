So inconsistent with my passion that I threw it all out
I took it from you, you
So apathetic with the forces that I burned them all out
I took it from you, you

So run when the water's rushing close
I'll find you near the edge and save you from the mes
Shoulda known you were gonna find out
You're gonna find out, but

Is it worth the episode?
Is it worth the episode? Oh no
Walking through the door alone
Is it worth the episode? Oh no

So covered up in all the fire that I never looked back
I took it from you, you
So agitated from the shadows can I take it all back?
I took it from you, you

Oh, all your pretty mind wants
Is atoms for my bones and ashes for my thoughts
Should've known you were gonna find out
I knew you'd find out but

Is it worth the episode?
Is it worth the episode? Oh no
Walking through the door alone
Is it worth the episode? Oh no

Should've known you were gonna find out
I knew you'd find out but
Is it worth the episode?
Is it worth the episode? Babe
Walking through the door alone, no
Is it worth the episode? No

Oh
Oh, oh no
Oh
Oh, oh yeah

Is it worth the episode?
Is it worth the episode? Oh no
Walking through the door alone
Is it worth the episode? Oh no

Shoulda known you were gonna find out
(Shoulda known you were gonna find out)
Shoulda known you were gonna find out
(I knew you'd find out)
