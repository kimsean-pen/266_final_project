Think fast boy, think on your feet
If you don't know it now you never will
You're so young to be so heavy
Rip off the seal and let me school you

You see angels melt when they touch the ground (We've got the doorway)
You see you're not dumb, you're just not aligned (We've got the hallway)
Because you could be the one percent (You can't restore yourself)
If you wanna

We're not good people
We're not good people, no
We're not good people, no
We're not good people, no
This is a warning

If God is God then why is he secret?
Today's the day you've been set free
They might claim the best things are hidden
But I was here, you came to me

With these five lines you will be reborn (We've got the doorway)
A superman or maybe a jock (We've got the hallway)
You can crush the whole world in your hand (You can't restore yourself)
If you wanna

We're not good people
We're not good people, no
We're not good people, no
We're not good people, no
This is a warning

You see angels melt when they touch the ground (We've got the doorway)
You see you're not dumb, you're just not aligned (We've got the hallway)
Because you could be the one percent (You can't restore yourself)
If you wanna

We're not good people
We're not good people, no
We're not good people, no
We're not good people, no
This is a warning
