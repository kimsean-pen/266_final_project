Here we are hanging onto our strains
Of green and blues
Break the chain and we will break down
Oh it's not real if you don't feel it

Unspoken expectations
Ideals you use to play with
They've finally taken shape

What's good enough for you
Is good enough for me
What's good enough
Is good enough for me
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Woo

Now you say you're starting to
feel the push and pull
Of what could be and never can.
You mirror me stumbling through those

Old fashioned superstitions
I find too hard to break
Oh, maybe you're out of place

What's good enough for you
Is good enough for me
It's good enough
It's good enough for me
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Good enough for you
Is good enough for me
It's good, it's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Old fashioned superstitions
I find too hard to break
Oh, maybe you're out of place

What's good enough for you
Is good enough for me
It's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Good enough for you
Is good enough for me
It's good, it's good enough
It's good enough for me
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, well, well, well
Uh-huh
Huh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
