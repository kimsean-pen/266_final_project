Drifting in and out
See the road you're on
You came rolling down the cheek
You say just what you need
And in between
It's never as it seems
Help me to name it
Help me to name it

If you built yourself a myth
You'd know just what to give
What comes after this
Momentary bliss
The consequence
Of what you do to me
Help me to name it
Help me to name it

Found yourself in a new direction
Aeons far from the sun
Can you come?
Would they come to breach you?
Let you know you're not the only one

You can't keep hangin' on
To all that's dead and gone
If you built yourself a myth
You'd know just what to give
Do you lie?
Oh, let the ashes fly
Help me to name it
Help me to name it
