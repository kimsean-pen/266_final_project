With this fall (I fall...) great grey clouds covered the sky
Dimming the light of sun, muting stars and crescent moon
Lost inside the world of gloomy, haunting shades
Descending into this abyss of human soul

In this dreariest of nights
Time can draw out like a blade

And yet Her grace shines through
Through me, and the brooding clouds
And if her light never falls on me
I'm content just to feel the lack

And this fall set requiem for my way
Away from other's paths, I turned to desolation
Away from other's thoughts, timid and surpassing
Away from the others, beyond caring

In this darkest of hours
Time draws out like a knife

The reflection once whole, now only a wound, seeping hurt and loss
The image once so bold, now only a scar, dry of hope and light

For all things ought to say, left unsaid
For all deeds ought to do, left undone
Be with me now...
