We're beautiful and damned
They say we're "good gone bad"
Too many stories told
New rules are getting old

Play the part - I'll play it too
But bad is good when I'm with you
Tonight they will obey and we'll command

Come on and
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Like a wildfire
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Like a wildfire
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Let go, go let it burn
It's the only way you'll learn
Even though it's gonna hurt
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Like a wildfire
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Like a wildfire
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Let go, go let it burn
It's the only way you'll learn
Even though it's gonna hurt

I know your heart's a mess
Don't worry Love, don't stress
Been holding back all week
Go on release the freak!

You've played the part - I've played it too
And bad is good when I'm with you
Tonight they will obey and we'll command

Come on and
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Like a wildfire
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Like a wildfire
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Let go, go let it burn
It's the only way you'll learn
Even though it's gonna hurt
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Like a wildfire
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Like a wildfire
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Let go, go let it burn
It's the only way you'll learn
Even though it's gonna hurt

Come on and
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Like a wildfire
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Like a wildfire
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Let go, go let it burn
It's the only way you'll learn
Even though it's gonna hurt
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Like a wildfire
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Like a wildfire
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! Let go, go let it burn
It's the only way you'll learn
Even though it's gonna hurt

Been holding back all week, go on release the freak!
