Hong Kong taxi driver
Why are you in such a hurry?
Living on the meters
Why are you running so fast?

Hong Kong taxi driver
You say "Are you happy?"
I just hide behind the wall
Full of biographies
Cause I'm a loser pathetic
I feel my agony through you

Ooooh, oooh, oooh
Ooooh, oooh, oooh
Ooooh, oooh, oooh
Ooooh, oooh, AHHH!
Ooooh, oooh, oooh
Ooooh, oooh, oooh
Ooooh, oooh, oooh
Ooooh, oooh, oooh

Hong Kong taxi driver
Perhaps we are missing someone
Living in these matters
Anyhow, we are losing

Hong Kong taxi driver
Honesty from a gold chain
Redeemed chillaxation
Came back from the pawn shop
Adorn myself to avoid
I feel my agony through you

Ooooh, oooh, oooh
Ooooh, oooh, oooh
Ooooh, oooh, oooh
Ooooh, oooh, AHHH!
AHHH!
