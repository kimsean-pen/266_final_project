All my life I broke everything I touch
Like my damn phone screen
So I don't hear it when it ring
I wouldn't answer anyway
I'm afraid of conversations
They only lead to temptation

So I always spend the night
And I'm gone in the morning
And then those tears in your eyes
Turn to voicemail recordings
And I don't ever play them back
I just act like I ain't get it
And I act like nothin happen
And then I text some other bitches
I know I'm not supposed to say that
You know my momma taught be better
I wish I had it all together
But I'm tearin at the seams
I'm cold in west coast weather
You say I never make sense
But my dolla signs comin
And you're still down for the ride
Even if I make nothin
Well ain't that sum
Ain't chu sweet as honey bees
I just wish I wasn't broken

And all those miles on your car
I wish that I could give them back
I wish you never picked me up
I wish I never smiled back
And I wish I said nothing
When you told me that you loved me
And all those fuckin love songs
I wish I never wrote em
But really most of all
I wish I wasn't lyin
And I wish I had the time
To tell you what I mean
I'm always showing up late
Like our very first date
I ran away to Hollywood
And said I see you some day
