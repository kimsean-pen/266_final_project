In every heart there's a hole
There's a space for something new
At every start there's a goal
There's a place we're running to

But in my strangest dreams
Through nights of feverish screams
I don't know what it means
But all I see is you

And when I've run too far
Chasing that lonesome star
I don't know who you are
But all I see is you, all I see is you, all I see is you

In every girl there's a door
An open gate to walk right through
But every girl wants much more
Than she can take and hold on to

And in my highest hopes
My brushes biggest strokes
A heavy stone that floats
All I see is you

With fear that won't let go
Tears that won't stop to flow
The truth I'll never know
All I see is you, all I see is you, all I have is you

And in my highest hopes
My brushes biggest strokes
A heavy stone that floats
All I see is you

And when I've run too far
Chasing that lonesome star
I don't know who you are
But all I see is you, all I see is you
All I want is you, all I want is you, all I have is you
