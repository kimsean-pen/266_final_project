So I sat with my head in my hands
And they started to rust
And my legs, as I tried to stand
Had turned into mush
I got sick, I got tired, I felt crushed
And I suffered (suffered)a lot
But I drew a big line in the dust
For you just to (just to) not cross

But if you talk about a dream enough it might come true

Fall into the void, it's mesmerizing
Captivated minds are sympathizing
Waiting on a sun that's never rising
Black, black sky is hypnotizing

Well I thought that I was a man
Who would follow (follow) my own road
Though I turned my back to you
So you'd follow (follow) your own
So long, my friend, goodbye
See you later (later) I guess
Get gone, get lost, awhile
I wish you (wish you) all the best

But if you talk about a dream enough it might come true

Fall into the void, it's mesmerizing
Captivated minds are sympathizing
Waiting on a sun that's never rising
Black, black sky is hypnotizing

I'm not getting bored, I'm just impatient
Watching your emotional immolation
Smile and take a bow to the ovation
Fade to black and change the station

Fall into the void, it's mesmerizing
Captivated minds are sympathizing
Waiting on a sun that's never rising
Black, black sky is hypnotizing

Fade to black
Fade to black
