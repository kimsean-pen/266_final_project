Bursting through a blood red sky, a slow landslide
And the world we leave behind
It's enough to lose your head, disappear
And not return again

When I fall to my feet wearin' my heart on my sleeve
All I see just don't make sense
You are the port of my call, you shot and leavin' me raw
Now I know you're amazing

'Cause all I need is the love you breathe
Put your lips on me and I can live
Underwater, underwater, underwater
Underwater

Flying through a bright blue sky with a space boy high
From the world I leave behind
It's enough to lose my head, disappear
And not be seen again

When I fall to my feet wearin' my heart on my sleeve
All I see just don't make sense
You are the port of my call, you shot and leavin' me raw
Now I know you're amazing

'Cause all I need is the love you breathe
Put your lips on me and I can live
Underwater, underwater, underwater

Underwater (Underwater, underwater, I can live underwater)
With your love I can breathe, I can breathe underwater
Underwater, underwater, I can live underwater
With your love I can breathe, I can breathe

Underwater (Underwater, underwater we could live underwater)
With your love I can breathe, I can breathe
Underwater (Underwater, underwater, we could live underwater)
With your love we could breathe, we could breathe underwater
