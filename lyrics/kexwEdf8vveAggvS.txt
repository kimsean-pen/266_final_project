I've been down this road before
Now, I'm coming back for more
This is like a déjà vu
I was born to be with you
Into the night we went to sleep
You and I were meant for keeps
Into the night, we went to play, you and I

I really hope, you'll always be so in love with me
I really hope, we'll always stay so attached this way-ee-ay
I really hope, you'll always be so in love with me
I really hope, we'll always stay so attached this way-ee-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay

So beware of the pitfall
We don't have to change at all
And our light will not burn out
It's what freedom's all about
Into the night we'll go to sleep
You and I were meant for keeps
Into the night we'll go to play, you and I

I really hope, you'll always be so in love with me
I really hope, we'll always stay so attached this way-ee-ay
I really hope, you'll always be so in love with me
I really hope, we'll always stay so attached this way-ee-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay

I really hope, you'll always be so in love with me
I really hope, we'll always stay so attached this way-ee-ay
I really hope, you'll always be so in love with me
I really hope, we'll always stay so attached this way-ee-ay

I really hope that we'll always be here
I really hope that you'll always be near
Take me and break me I'll always be here
I really hope that we'll always be near
