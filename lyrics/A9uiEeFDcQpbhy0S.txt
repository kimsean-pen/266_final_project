I walk around for one half hour
My thinking's clear at night
In all the worlds I think I hear you
Soothing all the time

I've been let off of work today
But all my plans are flakes
You're scared and it's feels unfair
But maybe I'll be brave

I think I need you when I die
When I've got no one on my side
I think about it all the time
When I need to
Get back when I see through lies
This time I scream until I cry
Then laugh for hours
Like we folded in half
I think about it all the time
When I leave you it won't be a clean goodbye

I never found a stead refusal
Like gritted through my teeth
You give me time for when I'm sinking
When I fail to please
Fighting off your lack of prowess
You smell like cigarettes
Reminded me of what you withdrew
When I hitched my bets

Slow down
Show me what you've seen
No I can't think of you
I'll only stay so you'll feel ok
But maybe I should move

I think I need you when I die
When I've got no one on my side
I think about it all the time
When I need to
Get back when I see through lies
This time I scream until I cry
Then laugh for hours
Like we folded in half
I think about it all the time
When I leave you it won't be a clean goodbye

Look you say
We gotta stay warm
Well gotta stay calm
Oh embrace
You got me but I can't tell if you are trying or not

I think I need you when I die
When I've got no one on my side
I think about it all the time
When I need to
Get back when I see through lies
This time I scream until I cry
Then laugh for hours
Like we folded in half
I think about it all the time
When I leave you it won't be a clean goodbye
