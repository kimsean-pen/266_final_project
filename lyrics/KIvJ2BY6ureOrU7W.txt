A line is drawn up in the sand
Is this the way to no-where land?
You never seen the sky like this
You never want to die like this

Comets falling for the earth
Is this the end or a re-birth?
You never seen the sky like this
You never want to die like this

Mother
Are we flying through the universe?
Are we dying through the universe?

Fire burning on the sun
It's killing almost everyone
You never seen the sky like this
You never want to die like this

Dancing in the acid rain
That's falling on the streets of shame
You never seen the sky like this
You never want to die like this

Mother
Are we flying through the universe?
Are we dying through the universe?
We are crying to you mother
Are we flying through the universe?
Are we dying through the universe?

Mother
Are we flying through the universe?
Are we dying through the universe?
We are crying to you mother
Are we flying through the universe?
Are we dying in the universe?

Comets falling for the earth
Is this the end or a re-birth?
You never seen the sky like this
You never want to die like this
