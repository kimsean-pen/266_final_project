Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Oh, baby now let's get down tonight

Ooh baby, I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

And when I get that feelin'
I want sexual healin'
Sexual healin', oh baby
Makes me feel so fine

Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healin' baby, is good for me
Sexual healin' is something that's good for me

Whenever blue teardrops are fallin'
And my emotional stability is leavin' me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up, baby

And honey, I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealin'
Ohh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healin'

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Let's make love tonight
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you do it right

Baby, I got sick this mornin'
A sea was stormin' inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizin'
The waves are risin' and risin'

And when I get that feelin'
I want sexual healin'
Sexual healin' is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us

Sexual healin', baby, it's good for me
Sexual healin' is something that's good for me
Well, it's good for me and it's so good to me, my baby, ohh

Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be makin' it, honey
I'll be feelin' fine
You're my medicine, open up and let me in
Darlin', you're so great, I can't wait for you to operate

(Healing, my darling)
I can't wait for you to operate
When I get this feelin'
I need sexual healin'
Oh when I get this feelin'
I need sexual healin'
I gotta have sexual healin', darlin'
'Cause I'm all alone
Sexual healin', darlin'
Till you come back home
Please don't procrastinate
It's not good to masturbate
