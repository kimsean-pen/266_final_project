Oh my lover
Don't you know it's alright
You can love her
You can love me at the same time

Much to discover
I know you don't have the time but
Oh my lover
Don't you know it's alright

Oh my sweet thing
Oh my honey thighs
Give me your troubles
I'll keep them with mine

Take at your leisure
Take whatever you can find but
Oh my sweet thing
Don't you know it's alright

It's alright
It's alright
There's no time
So it's alright

What's that color?
Forming around your eyes
Waltz my lover
Tell me that it's all right

Just another
Before you go
Go away
Oh my lover
Why don't you just say my name

And it's alright
Say it's alright
There's no time
