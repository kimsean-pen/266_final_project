This world was never worthy
But how can I call it unfaithful
Every promise was fulfilled
As decay crawled from its throat
Like the dead rising from an open grave
Like the dead rising from an open grave

Lips of splendor
Tongue of deceit
All dying now
As our fragile wrists hold only waste

Like those gasping for their last breath
We cannot hide
There's nothing left
Like those gasping for their last breath
We cannot hide
There's nothing left

Nothing left
Nothing left
(There's nothing left)
Nothing left

If all my sorrow has led me here
Then I would cry all of my tears
To have this chance, to have this chance again
To have this chance, to have this chance
And know there's more than this
And know there's more than you

Like those gasping for their last breath
We cannot hide
There's nothing left
Like those gasping for their last breath
We cannot hide
There's nothing left
