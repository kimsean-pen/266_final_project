I hope you're not at home
I like it when you're staying now
I hope you found a bird
They are feeling guilty but

And baby, I need you to be someone
But you're not you
Baby, I need you to be something
But you mean nothing to me

Hey, hey, hey
I'd rather be alone
Hey, hey, hey
I'm sure, sure you know I'm right
Hey, hey, hey
If I say we're just killing time

It's your last chance to hit me hard
Hit me hard
Hit me hard
(Hey, hey, hey)
I know we're just killing time
(Hey, hey, hey)

And I'm an honest drunk
We've got a lot to talk about
You were everybody's sign
It's funny how it's working out

Baby, I need you to be someone
But you're not you
Baby, and I need you to be something
But you mean nothing to me

Hey, hey, hey
I'd rather be alone
Hey, hey, hey
I'm sure, sure you know I'm right
Hey, hey, hey
If I say we're just killing time

It's your last chance to hit me hard
Hit me hard
Hit me hard
(Hey, hey, hey)
I know we're just killing time
(Hey, hey, hey)
It's your last chance to hit me hard
Hit me hard
Hit me hard
Hit me hard

Hey, hey, hey
I'd rather be alone, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
I'm sure, I'm sure you know I'm right
Hey, hey, hey
If I say we're just killing time

It's your last chance to hit me hard
Hit me hard
Hit me hard
(Hey, hey, hey)
I know we're just killing time
(Hey, hey, hey)
It's your last chance to hit me hard
Hit me hard
Hit me hard (Hey, hey, hey)
I know we're just killing time
(Hey, hey, hey)

It's your last chance to hit me hard
And hit me hard
Hit me hard
Hit me hard
