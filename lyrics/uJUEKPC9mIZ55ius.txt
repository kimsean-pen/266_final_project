It's been five months
Since you went away
Left without a word,
Nothin' to say (nothin' to say)
When I was the one,
Who gave you, my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you
No oh-oh
So I asked God

God send me an Angel
From the Heavens above
Send me an Angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
'Cause all I dooo... is cry (is cry)
God send me an Angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes

And I, know it might sound crazy
But after all that I still loved you
You wanna come back in my life
But now there's something I have to do
I have to tell the one, that I once adored
That they can't have my love no more
My heart can't take no more lies
And my eyes are all out of cries
Sooo... God

God send me an Angel
From the Heavens above
Send me an Angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
'Cause all I dooo... is cry (All I do is cry)
God send me an Angel, (Send me an Angel) to wipe the tears from my eyes

Now you had me on my knees
Begging God please
To se-end you-ou back to me
I couldn't eat
I couldn't sleep
And you made me feel like I could not breathe
When I...
All I wanted to do
Was feel your touch
And to give you all of my love but you
Took my love for granted
Want my lovin' now
But, you can't have it
Oh God!

God send me an Angel (Send me an Angel) from the Heavens above
Send me an Angel to heal my broken heart
(Ohh God) From being in love
'Cause all I dooo... is cry (is cry)
God send me an Angel
(Send me an Angel) To wipe the tears from my eyes

Oh-oh God
Send me-e (God send me an Angel) an A-a-a-angel (to wipe the tears from my eyes)
Oh...

Send me an Angel from the Heavens above
Send me an Angel to heal my heart (God send me an Angel) from being in love
Send me (an Angel) ohh God
Se-e-end me-e an A-angel
Se-e-end me-e an Angel (Send me an Angel)
Ohh-oh God (an Angel)
