Two ways to view the world,
so similar at times,
Two ways to rule the world,
to justify their crimes.

By kings and queens young men
are sent to die in war,
their propaganda speaks,
those words been heard before.

Two ways to view the world
brought Europe down in flames,
Two ways to rule...

Has man gone insane?
A few will remain,
who'll find a way
to live one more day,
through decades of war?
It spreads like disease,
there's no sign of peace.
Religion and greed
cause millions to bleed,
three decades of war...

From dawn to dawn they're fighting,
die where they stand.
The fog of war lies thick
when armies scorch the land.
When all of Europe is burning,
what can be done?
They've been to war a decade,
two more to come!

Long way from home,
(Döpas och dö i strid).
Lifetime at war...

Has man gone insane?
A few will remain,
who'll find a way
to live one more day,
through decades of war?
It spreads like disease,
there's no sign of peace.
Religion and greed
cause millions to bleed,
three decades of war...

When they face death they're all alike:
no right or wrong,
rich or poor...
No matter who they served before,
good or bad...
They're all the same,
rest side by side now...
