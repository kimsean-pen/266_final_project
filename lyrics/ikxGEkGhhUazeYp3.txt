Heaven is a switchboard that you want to fight
She would even miss you if you taught her sight
Power politician leaning to the right
Baby's got a trust fund
That she'll want to go off like that
Get off of my stack
Leave a little window
Get off of my stack

Now we wear same-colored yellow uniforms
Sky is burning, but at least we know we're warm
Go and run yourself a million miles
Hoping that the colors run out
and you go off like that
Get off of my stack
Leave a little window
get off of my stack

You can never see yourself
Ringing all around it
You can never see yourself
Ringing all around it
You can never see yourself
Ringing all around it
You can never see yourself
Ringing all around it
You can never see yourself
Ringing all around it
You can never see yourself
Ringing all around it

No one
No one ...
Michigan
You labored
You labored
Michigan

Not another payoff
Get off of my stack
Leave a little window
Get off of my stack
You know you can do
Get off of my stack
Stack
Michigan, Michigan, Michigan, Michigan
(Michigan, Michigan, Michigan, Michigan) ...
Michigan, Michigan, Michigan, Michigan (You can never see yourself ringing all around it)
Michigan, Michigan, Michigan, Michigan (You can never see yourself ringing all around it) ...
