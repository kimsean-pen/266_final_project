So there's nothing that I can do
Cause you know it's true
There's no way I will get through

I'm holding my breath
Doing my best to stand one again
I stand motionless
But I'm turning into another one

Anyone
What you afraid I'll do anything for death?
Everyday
I lose control I'm controlled but I lose my mind

I feel like another
I know I can get over
And I'm waiting for my time
I'm a failure I can't stop me now
Cause I'm falling, falling down

Hey,
Do you believe what I'm saying now
You better hold me tight
Cause no one knows wheres my fucking mind

Anyone
What you afraid I'll do anything for death?
Everyday
I lose control I'm controlled but I lose my mind

There's something in my head
There's something in my head
There's something in my mind
There's something in my mind

I have a demon inside my head
(Everyday I feel like another one)
There's something in my head
(I can't tell why am I still inside?)

I feel like another
I know I can get over
And I'm waiting for my time
I'm a failure I can't stop me now
Cause I'm falling, falling down

I feel like another
I know I can get over
And I'm waiting for my time
I'm a failure I can't stop me now
And it's still in my head
This motherfucker is in my head
(Take it out)
Take it out
Take it out
