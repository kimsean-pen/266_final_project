I know what it takes to break you
You know I never sleep
And just because you made them think
Doesn't mean the world've fall into place

Talk sometime but now you know
Tomorrow is too late
Close your eyes, walk with me
I'll set you free and everything you asked for

I found a way and I'll return for sure
I have to see those who do not know, rest in peace
I'm calling for you and I will be, yeah
I will be with you tonight

If today was your last day
Would that change a thing?
You probably believe what you told them
Live each moment like your last

Oh, close your eyes, walk with me
I'll set you free and everything you asked for

I found a way and I'll return for sure
I have to see those who do not know, rest in peace
I'm calling for you, I will be, yeah
I will be with you tonight

I found a way and I'll return for sure
I have to see those who do not know, rest in peace
I'm calling for you, oh, I will be with you

I found a way and I'll return for sure
I have to see those who do not know, rest in peace
I'm calling for you, I will be, yeah
I will be with you tonight
