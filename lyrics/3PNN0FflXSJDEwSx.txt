I can tell by the way
When I'm holding you tight
Something is wrong
No it's never been right
I can see by the way
That you stare in my eyes
Tempted and there's nothing inside

What if I told you
That I've been thinking
I've been dreaming 'bout you
And all the things I always thought that we'd do
But it was never enough...

I can't figure out
Why you don't love me now
So why'd you tear me down
I'm faceless in the crowd
So tell me is this real
'Cause I can't help but feel
I'm heading for heart-ache

Can I make you feel
Like you've never been kissed
Like a picture you paint
Will I ever be missed
Would you stay if I told you my love wouldn't change
If your hair turns grey
If you gain a little weight

What if I told you
That I've been thinking
I've been dreaming 'bout you
And all the things I always thought that we'd do
But it was never enough...

I can't figure out
Why you don't love me now
So why'd you tear me down
I'm faceless in the crowd
So tell me is this real
'Cause I can't help but feel
I'm heading for heart-ache (Oh...)
I'm heading for heart-ache (Oh yeah...)

I'm not giving you up...
I'm not giving you up...
(I'm heading for heart-ache)

I can't figure out
Why you don't love me now (you don't love me now)
So why'd you tear me down
I'm faceless in the crowd (you don't love me now)
So tell me is this real
'Cause I can't help but feel
I'm heading for heart-ache
