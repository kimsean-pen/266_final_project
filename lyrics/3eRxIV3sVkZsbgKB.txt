Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
I know...

Let alone to rust alone
Yeah, you're making me
I had to run, the damage is done
I give it up, I give it up
There's nothing left so take the rest
Yeah, you're draining me
I set it light, it burns so bright
Stab it out, hey, stab it out, hey

Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
I know
Yeah, I know, hey, I know

I had to run, the damage is done
I give it up, I give it up
I had to go, it got control
Yeah, you're breaking me
There's nothing left so take the rest
Stab it out, hey, stab it out, hey
I set it light, it burns so bright
Yeah, you're draining me

You make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
I know
Yeah, I know, that it's true

Let alone to rust alone
Let alone to rust alone
Let alone to rust alone

Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster

There's nothing left so take the rest
There's nothing left so take the rest
There's nothing left so take the rest
There's nothing left so take the rest

Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Let alone...
