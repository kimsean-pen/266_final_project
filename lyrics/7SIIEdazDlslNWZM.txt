I've watched you from a distance but never spoken a word
I have seen every flaw you tried to hide from the world
I sit silent in shadows watching the paths you have made
If only you knew my intentions
I've watched you make the same mistakes over and over
This is not healthy
I need to some how stop this
But your beauty intrigues me
It seems to be pulling me in
All I want is a moment or something I can hold close for eternity
I've watched you make the same mistakes over and over
I only you knew my name and all of my motives
Yet I sit in the same place every night and wait for you to come back home
A few moments would help me find myself
But this problem has taken its tragic grip
Just a few moments will help me find myself again
If only you knew my name and all of my motives
I need to somehow stop this
All I need is a moment or something I can hold close for eternity
Something I can hold close to me
