When I think back on these times
And the dreams we left behind

I'll be glad cause I was blessed to get
To have you in my life
When I look back on these days

I look and see your face
You were right there for me.
In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart there'll always be a place for you
For all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me

And everywhere I am there you'll be
and everywhere I am there you'll be
Well you showed me how it feels
To feel the sky within my reach
And I always will remember all
The strength you gave to me

Your love made me make it through
Ohh I owe so much to you
You were right there for me.
In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart there'll always be a place for you

For all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am there you'll be
and everywhere I am there you'll be
Cause I always saw you in my light, my strength
And I wanna thank you now for all the ways

You were right there for me, you were right there for me
you were right there for me
For always
In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart there'll always be a place for you
For all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am there you'll be
and everywhere I am there you'll be
