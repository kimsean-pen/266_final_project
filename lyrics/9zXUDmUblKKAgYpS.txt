I see you at night,
and I stare at you
You don't care for me

Without the light,
I still glare at you,
look away from me.

So don't lie,
it's taken you all night,
of feeling the same
with me

So don't die,
it's taken you all night,
of feeling the same.

You are too old to fare on your own
You are too old to fare on your own

And they say, it can't be won
when it's your eyes
touching my eyes
to the past we know
They say it can't be done,
and they say it's all just fun
it's your eyes
touching my eyes

You like what you find,
staring back at you
You don't care for me

So don't lie,
it's taken you all night,
of feeling the same
with me

And you know that I won't, know that I won't
You are too old to fare on your own

And they say, it can't be won
when it's your eyes
touching my eyes
to the past we know
They say it can't be done,
and they say it's all just fun
it's your eyes
touching my eyes

Won't you comfort me?
Comfort me?

And they say, it can't be won
when it's your eyes
touching my eyes
to the past we know
They say it can't be done,
and they say it's all just fun
it's your eyes
touching my eyes

This isn't you that I came here for,
This isn't you that I waited for(repeat)
