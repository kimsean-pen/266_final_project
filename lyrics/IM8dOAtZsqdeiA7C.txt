Off the Heezay
Uargh!

I've been taken from your arms so many times
I've felt this before
The sheets are tangled
And they don't feel right on my carcass
Like you do

This is my revenge
This is my revenge
This is my revenge
This is my revenge
This is my revenge

(Yes-yes-yes)
For every second sleep has stole
I feel dead
I feel dead inside

I feel dead
I feel so fucking dead
I feel dead
I feel so dead

Last night we dressed to our best
And drank til there was nothing left
I walked you home
You held my hand
We fucked away the rest of the night

Take my hand
This is my revenge
This is my revenge
For every second lost

(Aaargh!)
This is my revenge
This is my revenge
This is my revenge
This is my...
This is my revenge
This is my...

Uargh!
(For every second sleep has stole)
Uuah

And sweetie, I've got to say
That I'm really not worth the time of your day
I guess when we left each other for the first time
We didn't think goodbye would be our new favorite line
