But you got me on fire
You got me going all night
You got me going all night
You got me going all night
You got me going all night

But I, I'd like to see you better
I'd like to move it around
Wish you knew me better

And no one knows that I
I'd like to feel you better
Quit the cruising, come on
This is where you belong now

Will I see you on another day?
Make me blue, make me fall into you
See you on another day
Make me blue, say you do, say you do

But you got me on fire
You got me going all night
You got me on fire
You got me going all night
You got me on fire
You got me going all night
You got me on fire

Tonight
I found a treasure in you
Sweet's the taste you love
Feels like I always knew

And tell me when your mind's made up
You want it, but you won't stand up
So maybe I just want it too much
And watch me fly solo

Will I see you on another day?
Make me blue, make me fall into you
See you on another day
Make me blue, say you do, say you do

But you got me on fire
You got me going all night
You got me on fire
You got me going all night
You got me on fire
You got me going all night
You got me on fire
You got me going all night
You got me going all night

love you forever, 'cause you make it better
I love you forever
I love you forever, 'cause you make it better
I love you forever

But you got me on fire
You got me going all night
You got me on fire
You got me going all night
You got me on fire
You got me going all night
You got me on fire
You got me going all night

(I love you forever)
You got me going all night
(I love you forever)
(I love you forever, 'cause you make it better)
(I love you forever)
