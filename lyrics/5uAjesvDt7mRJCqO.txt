This moment feels like an echo
We've done this dance a thousand times
You say that I need a refill
And twist me up 'til we blur the lines

Oh
Girl you make a fool of my heart
Oh
You don't know what you do to me

With nights like these, who needs the days?
I'll shut my eyes and sleep them away
I'm on the dark side of your room
With the notches on your bedpost
With friends like you, who needs friends?
I shut my mouth and we do it all again
I'm on the dark side of your room
With the notches on your bedpost
With the notches on your

This seems so complicated
Are these your friends, or are they mine?
They love having you stir me up, up
And leave me burning like the LA fight

Oh
Girl you make a fool of my heart
Oh
You don't know what you do to me
Do to me, do to me

With nights like these, who needs the days?
I'll shut my eyes and sleep them away
I'm on the dark side of your room
With the notches on your bedpost
With friends like you, who needs friends?
I shut my mouth and we do it all again
I'm on the dark side of your room
With the notches on your bedpost

With the notches on your bedpost
With the notches on your bedpost

Oh
Girl you make a fool of my heart
Oh
You don't know what you do to me in the dark

With nights like these, who needs the days?
I'll shut my eyes and sleep them away
I'm on the dark side of your room
With the notches on your bedpost
With friends like you, who needs friends? (Who needs friends?)
I shut my mouth and we do it all again
I'm on the dark side of your room
With the notches on your bedpost
With the notches on your bedpost

(With friends like you, who needs friends?
I shut my mouth and we do it all again
I'm on the dark side of you room
With the notches on your bedpost)
With the notches on your bedpost
