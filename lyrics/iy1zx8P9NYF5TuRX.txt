Nine a.m.
In your bedroom
The radio alarm clock is set for soon
I know you friends and you know mine too
You don't tell on me, I won't tell on you
I get around

Seconds to your elevator from the station
How can I resist that kinda invitation
Seventh floor and I'm in trouble
Gotta get me back down to street level
I get around

Here I come when I better go
I say "Yes" when I ought to say "No"
Here I come when I better go
I say "Yes" when I ought to say "No"

Quietly slide away off the mattress
Find my clothing on the bed post
So I tip toe out of this mess
As I slip back into last night's dress
I get around

Put a little lipstick back on my face
Blow a little kiss to you from the doorway
Walk the hall right past the staircase
Take the elevator back down out of this place
I get around

Here I come when I better go
I say "Yes" when I ought to say "No"
Here I come when I better go
I say "Yes" when I ought to say "No"

I say "Yes" when I ought to say "No"
I say "Yes" when I ought to say "No"
I say "Yes"
I say "Yes"
I say "Yes"
I say "Yes"
I say "Yes"
Say "Yes"
Say "Yeah"

Here I come when I better go
I say "Yes" when I ought to say "No"
Here I come when I better go
I say "Yes" when I ought to say "No"

Here I come when I better go
I say "Yes" when I ought to say "No"
Here I come when I better go
I say "Yes" when I ought to say "No"

Here I come
Here I come
Here I come
Here I come
(Here I come)
Here I come
(Here I come)
Here I come
(Here I come)
Here I come
(Here I come)

I say "Yes" when I ought to say "No"
