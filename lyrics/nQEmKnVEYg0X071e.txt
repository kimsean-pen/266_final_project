My pretty cloud in the sky
I'm watching you from afar
Sometimes you float up and grace me
With sun
And sometimes you come very close
And multiply yourself
Heavy and thick raining sorrow
On me

Still, I am blissful
In whatever you give me
I lean on the mystery of who you are
Still, I am blissful
In whatever you show me
A real curiosity of who you are

Sensitive to temperature
Sensitive to moisture
Sensitive to the winds that always come
And there are days when you spread yourself
So thin across the atmosphere
That I can't see you anymore

Still, I am blissful
In whatever you give me
I lean on the mystery of who you are
Still, I am blissful
In whatever you show me
A real curiosity of who you are

Still, I am blissful
In whatever you give me
I lean on the mystery of who you are
Still, I am blissful
In whatever you show me
A real curiosity of who you are

Goodbye
Goodbye
