Good morning! Today's Forecast calls for Blue Skies!
Sun is shining in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped raining
Everybody's in the place
And don't you know, it's a beautiful new day
Hey hey hey!

Running down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly
In the city
All the streets where once was pity
Mr Blue. Sky is living in today!
Hey hey hey!

Mr Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long?
Soo Long!
Where did we go wrong?
Mr Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long?
Soo Long!
Where did we go wrong?

Hey you with the pretty face
Welcome to the human race!
It's so precious
Mr Blue Sky's up there waiting
And today
Is the day we waited for!
Or- or or!

Mr Blue Sky
Please tell us why
you had to hide away for so long?
Soo long!
Where did we go wrong?

Hey there Mr Blue!
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around see what you do
Everybody smiles at you!
Mr Blue Sky!
Mr Blue Sky!
Mr Blue Sky-yyyyy!
Mr Blue, you get it right

But soon comes Mr. Night
Creeping over, now his hand is on your shoulder
Nevermind
I'll remember you this
I'll remember you this way!
Mr Blue Sky
Please tell us why
you had to hide away for so long?
Soo Long!
Where did we go wrong?
Hey there Mr Blue (Sky!)
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around see what you do
Everybody smiles at you!
