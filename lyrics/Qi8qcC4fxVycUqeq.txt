He was leading us thru the dark.
He was sayin that "love goes on."
I was wanting some "ice cream."
He knew exactly what I meant.
From the driver's seat in the dark.
He popped a tape in the dash of his car.
And when the singer started to scream.
I knew exactly what he meant.
I never knew for sure, what a wonderful man he was.
What a sensible man he was.
What a marvelous man he was.
Why do we love what is wrong? big devil told us to sing along.
And like a loving flock we obey, except 4 him, he went his own way.
I never knew for sure, what a wonderful man he was.
Till the day I found out his cause, was to do it for all of us
