how quaint, you can
spit farther than me.
your life strait from
a movie scene.
now on a movie screen.
silver skies and black eyes.
i want a piece of cake.
get your hands off my presents
kiss on the face
slap on the cheek
i'll be the one who takes my chances.
sort of sad, isn't it?
it's hard to forget the friend
who makes the scene on t.v.
she makes the scene on t.v.
who's like that, anyway?
