When I think about my life
I wonder if I will survive
To live to see in 25 or will I just fall?
Like all my friends, they just keep dying.
People round me, always crying.
In this place I like to call my home.

Not everyone knows, that everybody goes to a better place.
Not everybody knows that everybody could be living their last days
But the hard times will come, and we'll keep movin' on.
We're movin' on.
Keep movin' on.

Life. Hope. Truth. Trust.
Faith. Pride. Love. Lust.

All make up the things we've lost
but things we've gained we'll take with us.

And all i have is these two hands
To make myself a better man
I wonder if I'll ever see the end of this.
And all this rain it keeps on falling
On my head and now I'm calling
Out to someone else to help me
Make it through.

Not everyone knows, but everybody goes to a better place.
Not everyone knows that everybody could be living their last days
But the hard times will come, and we'll keep movin' on.
We're moving on.
Keep moving on.

Life. Hope. Truth. Trust.
Faith. Pride. Love. Lust.
Pain. Hate. Lies. Guilt.
Laugh. Cry. Live. Die.

Some friends become enemies
Some friends become your family.
Make the best with what you're given
This ain't dyin', this is livin'!

Said we're movin' on
And we got nothing to prove
To anyone
Cause we'll get through
We're movin' on and on and on and on...
Life. Hope. Truth. Trust.
Faith.Pride. Love. Lust.
Pain. Hate. Lies. Guilt.
Laugh. Cry. Live. Die.
Some friends become enemies
some friends become your family.
Make the best with what you're given
This ain't dyin', this is livin'!
