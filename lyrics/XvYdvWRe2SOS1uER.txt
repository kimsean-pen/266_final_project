With a hole in my head I looked for you
Through the trenches of war the whole world through
My desire to leave with you I just can't constrain

I regret everything I've done so far
When the pillars of love are blown apart
I stumble through the rubble and decay

When I'm terrified I close my eyes
When I'm sad and blue I choose to fight
Heartbreak only can take you to the other side

My impression of you is hard to comprehend

When 2 people have no time to spend
You're the dreamiest girl who ever entered my mind

The bliss I feel knowing you're delirious
Makes me feel oh so imperious
When the longing comes I'll fight it till the end

When all broken dreams are glued back together
And there's nothing to talk about not even the weather
And all rivals are all laid to rest
When in purity, I silently reach for you
When scarecrows shivered and the cornfields too
I've reached my goal of eternity with you
When that painful restless feeling does subside
And your perfume lingers coolly in my night
I'm fit to leave this war behind
I recharge and revolt, my time has come
And I'm tempted to duel even the sun
I'll dodge the rays, kill it with my gun
