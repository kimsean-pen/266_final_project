(Forced amnesia, an epiphany won't see yaaaaaa)
He's remembered everything and now I'm dead
(Forced amnesia, an epiphany won't see yaaaaaa)
He's remembered everything and now I'm dead
He's remembered everything and now I'm dead
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
He's been tossing and turning all day in his bed
Trying to remember all the things I said
(Forced amnesia, an epiphany won't see yaaaaaa)
I didn't even look twice at his bleeding head
After all the unspeakable things he said
(Forced amnesia, an epiphany won't see yaaaaaa)
It's been a week and I can't get it out of my head
How he lost his mind when I fought instead
(Forced amnesia, an epiphany won't see yaaaaaa)
Pounding on my front door, wait, I thought he'd forget
He's remembered everything and now I'm dead
He's remembered everything and now I'm dead
(Forced amnesia, an epiphany won't see yaaaaaa)
(Forced amnesia, an epiphany won't see yaaaaaa)
He's remembered everything and now I'm dead
(Forced amnesia, an epiphany won't see yaaaaaa)
He's remembered everything and now I'm dead
He's remembered everything and now I'm dead
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
I took your memories...
