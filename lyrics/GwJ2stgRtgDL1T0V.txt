I've been thinking lately,
That I think too much quite frankly,
I just wanna get out this town and find a quiet place to be.
A place where dreams can come true.
A land made just for me and you.
Let's just get out this town and find a quiet place to be.

It don't have to be too far away,
Just a simplistic trance-like getaway.
It don't have to be a place to stay
Just a simplistic trance-like getaway.
Honey, let's just go
And let go
Of what we know.

I don't want to wake up
From this dream that I have dreamt up.
I just wanna get out this town
And find a quiet place to be.
A place where dreams do come true.
A land made just for me and you.
Let's just get out this town and find a quiet place to be

It don't have to be too far away,
Just a simplistic trance-like getaway.
It don't have to be a place to stay
Just a simplistic trance-like getaway.
Honey, let's just go
And let go
Of what we know.

Honey-dew, I wouldn't trade you for the world.
You are my dream that has come true.
You give me opportunity to recreate reality
Into a place where we are free to dance sing and eternally.
You are the missing half of me.
These moments turn to hours, hours turn to days,
Turn into weeks, turn into months, turn into years,
Turn into life times with you dear.

It don't have to be too far away,
Just a simplistic trance-like getaway.
It don't have to be a place to stay
Just a simplistic trance-like getaway.
Honey, let's just go
And let go
Of what we know
