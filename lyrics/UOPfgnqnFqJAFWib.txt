Feel the breeze, I feel alive
Will you come away with me

You'll be my focus
Could this be, could this be the highway

Keep your heart out on the road
Will you come to Tech Noir with me

Before you save me
Just wait your turn, look at me now
Steady as we burn
It was all for love
Just move yourself, drop it back now
And push it out in front

Before you save me
Just wait your turn, look at me now
Steady as we burn
It was all for love
Just move yourself, drop it back now
And push it out in front

Keep your heart out on the road
Will you come to Tech Noir with me

You'll be my focus
Could this be, could this be the highway

Before you save me
Just wait your turn, look at me now
Steady as we burn
It was all for love
Just move yourself, drop it back now
And push it out in front

Before you save me
Just wait your turn, look at me now
Steady as we burn
It was all for love
Just move yourself, drop it back now
And push it out in front
