There's a change in pace
Of fantasy and taste

Do you like good music?
Do you like to dance?
Oh yeah

Hangin' out for a body shop at night
Ain't it strange what we do to feel alright?
Oh yeah

So when will you call?
I am experienced
Oh yeah

Face to face
And back to back
You see and feel
My sex attack

Sing it
Flesh
Flesh for fantasy

We want
Flesh
Flesh for fantasy

It's after midnight
Are you feeling alright?
Oh yeah

Turn out the light babe
Are you someone else tonight?

Neighbour to neighbour, door to door
Don't ask questions, there's time for it all
Oh yeah

Face to face
And back to back
You see and feel
My sex attack
Sing it!

Flesh
Flesh for fantasy
We cry
Flesh
Flesh for fantasy
Oww!

I sing for culture
Father loves his son
Mothers, daughters too
It's an old, old story
Cries the new world too
Flesh
Flesh
Flesh for fantasy
We want, flesh
Flesh for fantasy
We want, flesh
Flesh for fantasy
You cry, flesh
Flesh for fantasy

Let's go down, let's go down
Let's go down, let's go down
Let's go down, let's go down
Do you like good music?
Do you like to dance?
It's nearly mornin'
You wanna risk a chance
Neighbour to neighbour
Door to door
Enjoy the crime
You do your time
Never been nothin' before
