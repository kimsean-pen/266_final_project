They say life will bring discomfort
And I discovered, we all just suffer
'Cause no one feels that bad
And it comes from one another
We hurt each other, just like a lover
And don't think twice 'bout that
Yeah and I feel like something's bad
But hell, I'm used to that
I always turn my back, yeah
And I wanna feel something
But all I feel is pain
I wanna make a change bad

You either pick yourself up or you let yourself down
Life will always be tough, so who the fuck are you now?
Will you make it alone or do you need someone else?

I don't need anyone, I'll do it all by myself

I got scars, put up my guard
I don't wanna get torn apart
I start to feel my heart
Race faster, it's pumping hard
And all I want is to be something
That's why I just keep on running
Can't stop what you don't see coming, yeah
And you know I'm coming
How can I trust you, if you don't trust me?
I do what I do, 'cause it is just me

And nothing is new, no, I'm not lucky
I work my ass off so I'll be something

You either pick yourself up or you let yourself down
Life will always be tough, so, who the fuck are you now?
Will you make it alone or do you need someone else?
I don't need anyone, I'll do it all by myself
