Baby what you hide in front
Maybe you should taste the sun
Baby don't you wanna come
With me

Baby, baby it's you
Uuhhh it's you
Baby, I care for you
Uuhhh I do

Baby dont you wanna see
Baby dont you sleep it be
After all it just you need
You are the one

Baby, baby it's you
Uuhhh it's you
Baby, I care for you
Uuhhh I do
