I would die for you!
Slit throat and break bones!
I'm in a killing mood!
Save me from damnation
I would burn for you!
Hands in the air to destroy!
I'm in a killing mood!
Save me from damnation

Sister save me all your lies
I understand I won't deny
Sister take my whole life
Take my pain
Take my knives

Cause I'll hold your violence and devotion

I would die for you!
Slit throat and break bones!
I'm in a killing mood!
Save me from damnation
Lead me from temptation
Save me from damnation

Sister save me all your lies
I understand I won't deny
Sister take my whole life
Take my pain
Take my knives

Cause I'll hold your violence and devotion

I survived in the violent moment of yesteryear
With one last goodbye
I survived in the violent devotion in your eyes
I survived in the violent moment of yesteryear
With one last goodbye
I survived in the violent devotion in your eyes
I survived in the violent moment of yesteryear
With one last goodbye

Sister save me all your lies
I understand I won't deny
Sister take my whole life
Take my pain
Take my knives

Sister save me all your lies
I understand I won't deny
Sister take my whole life
Take my pain
Take my knives

Cause I'll hold your violence and devotion
