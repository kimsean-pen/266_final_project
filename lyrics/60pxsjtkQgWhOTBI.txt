Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon

I'm a desperado underneath your window
I see your silhouette
Are you my Juliet?
I feel a mad connection with your body

Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon

I wanna be your lover
Your only Latin lover
We'll go around the world in a day
Don't say no, no, shake it my way

Oh, shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon

You're a Mata Hari
I wanna know your story
In the Sahara sun I wanna be the one
That's gonna come and take you

Make you shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon

Up in the Himalayas
Come on I wanna lay ya
We'll go around the world in a day
Don't say no, no, shake it my way

Oh, shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon

Hola Amiga, hola Amiga
You're my temple of desire
Hola Amiga, hola Amiga
Let my spirit take you higher

We'll go around the world in a day
Don't say no, no, shake it my way

Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon

Shake your bon-bon, baby
Shake your bon-bon, baby
Shake your bon-bon, baby
Shake your bon-bon, baby

We'll go around the world in a day
Don't say no, no, shake it my way

Oh, shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon

I'm a desperado underneath your window
I see your silhouette
Are you my Juliet?
I feel a mad connection with your body
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
I wanna be your lover
Your only Latin lover
We'll go around the world in a day
'Round the world will do the fine tango
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon, baby
Shake your bon-bon, baby
Shake your bon-bon, baby
