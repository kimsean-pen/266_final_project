Standing on the damp, wooden helm
I still not surrender
Barely I can hear the crew's moans
They're crying loud
Through the pouring rain
The icy spurts
And the crackling of the boards
I glimpse the headless, nightclad ghost

To believe
The seas are dwelled by our fears
Creatures of old, forgotten times
Do you believe
Draugen came to bring your life
From a whirlwind grandiose He appears
Draugen's Storm!

Rising from the deep
Black seas from the deepest abyss
He sails on the crimson waves
Of my lot for the final blow
Is He coming to announce
My final day on this dull night?
Embrace the last enigma knots

To believe
The seas are dwelled by our fears
Creatures of old, forgotten times
Do you believe
Draugen came to bring your life
From a whirlwind grandiose He appears
Draugen's Storm!

To believe
The seas are dwelled by our fears
Creatures of old, forgotten times
Do you believe
Draugen came to bring your life
From a whirlwind grandiose He appears
Draugen's Storm!
