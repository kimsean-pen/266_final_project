Tonight I fell so cold and lonely
Cause baby you're so far away
The space between us keeps on growing
How I wish that you could hear me when I say

No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Wish you could hear me say
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh I miss you, oh I miss you
Oh baby since you walked away
Oh I miss you, oh I miss you
I miss you more and more each day

Now tell me do you think about me
Cause I think about you all the time
A million miles just stand between us
But I don't wanna stop until you're mine

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Wish you could hear me say
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh I miss you, oh I miss you
Oh baby since you walked away
Oh I miss you, oh I miss you
I miss you more and more each day

Dale mamacita que la vida tiene ritmo
Dale mamacita que la vida tiene ritmo
Dale mamacita que la vida tiene ritmo
Dale mamacita que la vida tiene ritmo

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Wish you could hear me say
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh I miss you, oh I miss you
Oh baby since you walked away
Oh I miss you, oh I miss you
I miss you more and more each day

Oh I miss you, oh I miss you
Oh baby since you walked away
Oh I miss you, oh I miss you
I miss you more and more each day

I miss you more and more each day
I miss you more and more each day
I miss you more and more each day
I miss you more and more each day
