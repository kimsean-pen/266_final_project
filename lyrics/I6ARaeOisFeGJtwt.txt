the sound of your voice
rose graves of cats
the pounding of your steps
woke caves of bats

babies on the sun
babies on the sun

your first burning breath
was a symphony
and a ship full of horses
was going down at sea

babies on the sun
babies on the sun

babies on the sun
babies on the sun
on the sun
