She's off to party with the diamond dogs
From the wrong side of the tracks
Her window's open anytime she's home
But now it's locked up at last

She was bound to break free from the start
Girl got that rebel heart
She's out to rumble, gonna get it on
There ain't no stopping her now

Lucy
Run away
Run away, ay-ay-ay

Run away
Run away, ay-ay-ay

Run away
Run away, ay-ay-ay

Lucy
Lucy

She's off to sell herself to a seedy bar
The jaws are loaded for love
She gon' get beaten playing the dark
Innocence under attack

She was bound to be stabbed in the back
All for some fun in the sack
Now she's alone and got no one call
Oh, no she ain't turning back

Lucy
Run away
Run away, ay-ay-ay

Run away
Run away, ay-ay-ay

Run away
Run away, ay-ay-ay

Lucy
Lucy

Oh lucy
Alright
Yeah
Run away

Lucy
Run away
Run away, ay-ay-ay

Run away
Run away, ay-ay-ay

Run away
Run away, ay-ay-ay

Lucy
