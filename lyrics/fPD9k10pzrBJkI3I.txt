You're so delicious, you're so soft
Sweet on the tip of my tongue
You taste like sunlight
And strawberry bubble gum

You bite my lip, you spike my blood
You make my heart beat faster

Own me, you own, you rattle my bones
You turn me over and over till I can't control myself
Make me a liar, one big disaster
You make my heart beat faster

It's the way you swell, slow
Pushing right out your seams
It's the way you smile, baby
When you've got me on my knees

You're all night noise, you're siren howl
You make my heart beat faster

Own me, you own, you rattle my bones
You turn me over and over till I can't control myself
Make me a liar, one big disaster
You make my heart beat faster

'Cause I jump back, crash, I crawl
I beg and steal, I follow you
Yeah, you own me
And you make my heart beat faster

I can't get enough because it's on like
I guess this world is over to me

You own me, you own, you rattle my bones
You turn me over and over till I can't control myself
Make me a liar, one big disaster
You make my heart beat faster
