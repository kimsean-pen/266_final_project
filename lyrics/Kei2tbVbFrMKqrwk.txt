As the great war is over and lost
He's been wounded in war, he returns with awards

Into battle again far from home
From a far distant land, our Marshal command.

Home, siblings sent to their death
His wife payed the ultimate price
Still, as the war rages on
You are our guide
Far, far from the fame
Far, far away from the fame
But we still remember your name
Karel Janoušek
We mourn the day that you died
So be our guide, Czechoslovakia's pride

When the war has been fought and been won
Our Marshal returns, to be thrown into jail

Facing torture and years behind bars
When he's finally back, life in ivory black

Home, siblings sent to their death
His wife payed the ultimate price
Still, as the war rages on
You are our guide
Far, far from the fame
Far, far away from the fame
But we still remember your name
Karel Janoušek
We mourn the day that you died
So be our guide, Czechoslovakia's pride

(Solo)

Far, far from the fame
Far, far away from the fame
But we still remember your name
Karel Janoušek
We mourn the day that you died
So be our guide, Czechoslovakia's pride
Far, far from the fame
Far, far away from the fame
But we still remember your name
Karel Janoušek
We mourn the day that you died
So be our guide, Czechoslovakia's pride
