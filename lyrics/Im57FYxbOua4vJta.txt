(Something's wrong, something's wrong)
There's a bomb in my face
Decorated in white lace
(Something's wrong, something's wrong)
When people they look at you
Do you think
Do you think of food?

Stretch yourself (Carving out some lungs with a stake)
As far as this can go at night (Brontosaurus tracks, relax)
(Carving out some lungs with a stake)
Follow when I row (Brontosaurus tracks, relax)

Hey, is that your lady?

She gave it willingly
Hey wait, I've got the parts (To fix your head)
(To fix your head)
(To fix...)
She gave it willingly
(Hey wait, I've got the parts) To fix your head
Fix your head
Fix your head

Wait right here
I'm going to explode
Wait right here
I'm exploding
I've got to be in your car
I'm still shooting even par
