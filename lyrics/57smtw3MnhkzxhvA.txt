When the knife finds you with your
Hands all tied and the silence holds the answers
I am blind for the for the sun that wets the eyes
Simple measure, emulator
And if you fight, I could be that
wonderlight with no guidance
Other than my happy days
Often climb when you're ruined
With another
Hold me with your porcupine
While I catch on fire
Open letters grow the flowers

I know I got to let, let it go
Letting it go
I got to let, let it go
I know I got to let, let it go
Letting it go
I got to let, let it go

When the knife finds you with your
With your
With your
Hands all tied
And the silence holds the answers
I am blind for the for the sun that wets the eyes
Open letters grow the flowers

Letting it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I know
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Letting it go
I know I got to let, let it go
Letting it go
I got to let, let it go
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
