Never found me a reason why
All I saw was a hollow sky
Did I set my sights too high
To find the path before me
I dreamed of shooting stars
I travelled out so far
Tried to signal where you are
But nothing could assure me

Inside outside any side
Still I'm looking for alibis
Cast aside close my eyes now I'm here

And the words seem hollow now
But I don't want to let you down
Cuz the world just came around
And everything is brighter
I was so unsure
Til I found the door
And you let me in

When the flags have blown away
And the footprints start to fade
Will i find my way again
Or lose the path before me
I saw the leaves go brown
I saw them falling down
All my dreams lying on the ground
With nothing to assure me

Fall came, hard rain, clean again
Still I'm waiting and mesmerized
Purified, close my eyes, now I'm here

And the words seem hollow now
But I don't want to let you down
Cuz the world just came around
And everything is brighter
I was so unsure
Til I found the door
And you let me in

Fall came, hard rain, clean again
Still I'm waiting and mesmerized
Purified, close my eyes, now I'm here

And the words seem hollow now
But I don't want to let you down
Cuz the world just came around
And everything is brighter
I was so unsure
Til I found the door
And you let me in
