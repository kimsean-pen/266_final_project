One million miles from home
Crushing diamonds out of coal
Got lost in a vanilla sky
I'm lost in California time
Stuck in rotation till I close my eyes
Twist and turn throughout the night

I've been wandering hopelessly
Lost in my own skin
Knowing nothing you say or bring
Could ever bridge this distance
If every bad dream is on
Account of me then I'll
Deconstruct every bond between us

Just hold on until the light shines through
This will all feel better
When the morning comes
And we're not so tangled up
So when we both drift off to sleep
You can rest assured I'll find you in your dreams

I've been wandering hopelessly
Lost in my own skin
Knowing nothing you say or bring
Could ever bridge this distance
If every bad dream is on
Account of me then I'll
Deconstruct every bond between us

Every bad dream is on
Account of me
Every bad dream is on
Account of me

I'll spend my life avoiding sleep

I've been wandering hopelessly
Lost in my own skin
Knowing nothing you say or bring
Could ever bridge this distance
I've been wandering hopelessly
Lost in my own skin
Knowing nothing you say or bring
Could ever bridge this distance
If every bad dream is on
Account of me then I'll
Deconstruct every bond between us
