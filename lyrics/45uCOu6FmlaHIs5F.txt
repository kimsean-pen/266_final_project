How could I do this to myself for so long?
How could I do this to myself, it was wrong
I can't blame nobody else
Why did I do this to myself?

Memories and scars of a childhood mind
We are just standing in the shadows with no sense of time
Am I just lost?
Can't find my way home

I'm just gonna stand on the edge
And feel what it's like to fall
'Cause I'm tired of being afraid
But I'm not ready to let go

How could I do this to myself for so long?
How could I do this to myself, it was wrong
I can't blame nobody else
Why did I do this to myself?
Why did I do this to myself?

Stand on the edge
And feel what it's like to fall
'Cause I'm tired of being afraid
But I'm not ready to let go, ooh

How could I do this to myself for so long?
Why did I do this to myself, it was wrong
I can't blame nobody else
Why did I do this to myself? Ooh

Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Was it wrong for me to give you my all?
I can't blame nobody else
How did I do that to myself?
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)

You can chain me but I won't stay down
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
I'd forget me just to please the crowd
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
But not anymore, no, no
I'll never do that to myself
