I don't think it's fair
A-na-na-na
I don't think it's fair
That you get to go

The world is so much bigger than you know
You wanna tell me that you love me so
And then go

Don't think it's fair
Don't think it's fair

I don't think it's fair
A-na-na-na
I don't think it's fair
That you get to go

The world is so much bigger than you know
You wanna tell me that you love me so
And then go

Don't think it's fair
Don't think it's fair
I don't think it's fair

I don't think it's fair
Don't think it's fair
I don't think it's fair
Oh, not fair
