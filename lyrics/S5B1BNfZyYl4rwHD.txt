I 'm anxious and distraught for the last few days
Now there's nothing of the sort that makes it all right
This moment I am compelled to go off the deep end
I clutch at every straw, my heart is sinking

I give it one more try, I give it all I can
I never wanted more, I give it one more shot
I give it all I have to make things right

What scope is there left? Where is the hope then?
I've heard it all before when life is measured
A slow and tame despair is inside all of us
Your passionate old dreams sometimes you cry for

I give it one more try, I give it all I can
I never wanted more, I give it all I have
I give it one more shot to make things right

Little else we can cherish, little else is not enough
A glimpse, a glimpse of heaven
How can I see the stars?
As all others do, as all others do
As all others do, as all others do

I give it one more try, I give it all I can
I won't fail once more
Take the bull by the horns
Try my luck once more
To make things right
Again
