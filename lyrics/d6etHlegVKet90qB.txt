Sitting on a carousel ride
without any music or lights
Everything was closed at Coney Island
and I couldn't help from smiling
I can hear the Atlantic echo back
rollercoaster screams from summers past.
Everything was closed at Coney Island
and I couldn't help from smiling
Brooklyn will fill the beach eventually
and everyone will go except me.
