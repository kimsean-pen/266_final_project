Let's roll this joint
And go to the beach right now
We can just chill out
Let's go to the park
And drop this cid with me
We can stare at the trees, oh yea

You can be my, my summer love
You can be my, my summer lover
You can be my, my summer love
You can be my, my summer lover

Let's go to the bar
And take some shots of whiskey
And just get free
Let's go to the club
And take these capsules to space
I don't want to feel my face

You can be my, my summer love
You can be my, my summer lover
You can be my, my summer love
You can be my, my summer lover
