I
Fought the angels here today
Hope
My defeat will end this play
Everybody knows that
I only have myself to blame
Everybody knows that
Softly, softly wins the game

Trust
I'll try to learn again
My words
Are seldom for a friend

Knew
At the time that they came out
Wish
I could have them disallowed
Everybody knows that
We say things we do not mean
Everybody knows that
We say things that are unclean

Trust
I'll try to learn again
My words
Are seldom for a friend

Run
Conversations in my head
Write
My own scripts to dish the dread
And if I speak out loud
I will have to change the rules
For speaking's out of bounds
If it's practised by a fool

Trust
I'll try to learn again
My words
Are seldom for a friend
So lend me
An ear to lean upon
To speak to
And learn my speaking from
