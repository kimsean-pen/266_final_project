After the blast levels our town
We can relax and watch it come down
Maybe we'll find somewhere to stay
Some little cave where we can make it
We'll finally find what we need
After the ships leave us behind
We can forget the lives they assigned
Maybe we'll have more time to play
Running around totally naked
We'll finally find what we need
After we start over again
We'll start to feel safe in our skin
Maybe we'll be wrinkled and grey
Or maybe we'll get new plastic faces
We'll finally find what we need
Some sunsick day, sunsick day...
