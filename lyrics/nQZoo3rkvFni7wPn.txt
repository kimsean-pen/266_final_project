Crushing you inside of my grip again
You're breathing in
Pushing this aside till when?
Ignoring that pain
Felt you creep inside of my head again
It all depends on where I am

And who I'm there with
It's rough when we're both square one

With so much undone

Who lost?

Who won?
All rain, No sun
Don't want to have to speak to anyone

Said this will kill if you let it
Somehow I forget
I should be asleep

I shouldn't be upset
Playing the victim
While you're still here
Blaming the future on things I fear
I keep blaming the future on thing I fear

Waking up to gloom and routine again
You're breathing in
That air that dries your lungs
But you kept our trust

And said, "Do what you must to be happy"
And I left with a debt that called me
Out quick to be honest with it all
So now I just sing
I just sing about missing this and missing that
But what will it really bring?
If we're both square one
With so much undone
Who lost?
Who won?
Said this will kill if you let it
Somehow I forget
I should be asleep
I shouldn't be upset
Playing the victim
While you're still here
Blaming the future on things I fear
I keep blaming the future on thing I fear
Just a special circumstance
Where in lies the worst part that I can't accept
Coming up on Fall
Are there things we haven't spoke on yet?
Said you won't regret
But you and I are one in the same
Don't want to have to feel numb
I don't want this undone
Don't want to have to speak to anyone
Said this will kill if you let it
Somehow I forget
I should be asleep
I shouldn't be upset
Playing the victim
While you're still here
Blaming the future on things I fear
I keep blaming the future on thing I fear
