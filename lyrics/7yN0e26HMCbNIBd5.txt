On a holiday slow motion sets its pace
And it makes me pray for capricorns sweet face
Our lives get tangled up in progress
Falling short on life's test
When all that matters should be me and you

And you say it's not ok
Despite our life you cannot stay
And you say you're not ok

Well I can't explain how we made it this far
And you should know, only you control my heart
Feelings overshadow reason, blocks out everything
And all that matter should be me and you

And you say it's not ok
Despite our life you cannot stay
And you say you're not ok

I wouldn't trade what I got
Not for anything

And you say it's not ok
Despite our life you cannot stay
And you say you're not ok

On a holiday...
