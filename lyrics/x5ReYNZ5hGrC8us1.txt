Alright

Yeah it's been a bumpy road
Rollercoasters high and low
Fill the tank and drive a car, pedal fast, pedal hard
You won't have to go that far
You wanna give up 'cause it's dark

We're really not that far apart
So let your heart be your compass when you're lost

And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done, you can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what, you'll never be alone
you'll never be alone
you'll never be alone

Forgot directions on your way
Don't close your eyes don't be afraid
We might be crazy late at night

I can't wait till you arrive
Follow stars you'll be alright
You wanna give up 'cause it's dark
We're really not that far apart
So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lost

And you should follow it wherever it may go
'cause When it's all said and done, you can walk instead of run

'Cause no matter what, you'll never be alone
you'll never be alone
you'll never be alone

You wanna give up 'cause it's dark
We're really not that far apart
So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done, you can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what, you'll never be alone (never be alone)
(never be alone)
When it's all said and done, you can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what, you'll never be alone
