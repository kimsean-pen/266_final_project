Can you heal me baby?
I've been dancing in this fire for way to long
But I kinda like it
Oh I like it 'cause it's more dangerous than me
There's a siren somewhere
But I'm pretty sure it's only in my head
So tell me how do you hear it
Is there something supernatural in your bones?

Oh this is love like wildness
Coursing through you like a drug
And this is hurt like kindness
Breaking you with gentle hands

I call out your name it feels like a song I know so well
And it whispers and roars like an orchestra
You call out my name like no one before it sounds like I am
Called to a home that I never had

Can you heal me baby?
I've been wasted in the arms of everyone
I wasn't looking for you
But I think maybe I was and didn't know

Oh this is love like wildness
Coursing through you like a drug
And this is hurt like kindness
Breaking you with gentle hands

I call out your name it feels like a song I know so well
And it whispers and roars like an orchestra
Like an orchestra
You call out my name like no one before it sounds like I'm
I'm called to a home that I never had
