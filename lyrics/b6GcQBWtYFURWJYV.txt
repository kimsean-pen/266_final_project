Oh, the sinking spell
Got to tiny heals
Pin the notice to posts
And then crawled in my mouth

There is a feeling I love
Buried in my brow
I have no reason to run
I see no reason

ARE YOU WITH ME NOW
Are, are you with me now
Are

It's not impossible
It's not unfathomable
It's not unusual, baby
To feel the shadow and cry

There is a feeling I love
Buried in my brow
I have no reason to run
I see no reason

ARE YOU WITH ME NOW
Are, are you with me now
Are

Guess she knows me now
Guess she knows me now
Guess she knows me now
Guess she knows me

ARE YOU WITH ME NOW
Are, are you with me now
Are, are you with me now
Are, are you with me now
Are, are you with me now
