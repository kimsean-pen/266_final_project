make your choice
let it be the one you need
don't lose your way
just for any old thing

it's not what you thought
it's not what you wanted to see
but spring in the land, and light in the day
wasn't it good anyway?

anyway... anyway...

distant rumble, tattered and scared
there's no way to make it fair
what remains of who we are
and what's left of how we cared?

slow down, steady now
be here in this place
and hit your stride in your own time
who's watching anyway?
anyway... anyway...
