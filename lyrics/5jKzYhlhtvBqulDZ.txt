Oh, I thought you had moved on too soon (uh)
Do you wanna re-adress this mess?
Can we do this when you're not so drunk?
No, I won't take it, I won't take it,
I can't take this anymore...
Are you gonna talk now?
A smile let out
A smile disguised
That look I knew
Makeout, makeup
And kiss me slow
And looks control
I'm lost in you
Why do you hate yourself so much?
Honestly I can't stand all this talk
You break me up every time we touch
No, I won't take it, I won't take it,
I can't take this anymore
Are you gonna talk now?
A smile let out
A smile disguised
That look I knew
Makeout, makeup
And kiss me slow
And looks control
I'm lost in you
Fall back down,
Hit the ground,
Stop control,
Prideful fall
It's you I love, it's you I love
Come to sweet, feel relief...
Are you gonna talk now?
A smile let out
A smile disguised
That look I knew
Makeout, makeup
And kiss me slow
And looks control
I'm lost in you
Are you gonna talk now?
A smile let out
A smile disguised
That look I knew
Makeout, makeup
And kiss me slow
And looks control
I'm lost in you
