I'm going back to the time when we owned this town
Down Powder Mill Lane in the battlegrounds
We were friends and lovers and clueless clowns

I didn't know I was finding out how I'd be torn from you
When we talked about things we were gonna do
We were wide-eyed dreamers and wiser too

We'd go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café

I'm begging you for some sign, but you've still got nothing to say
Don't turn your back on me, don't walk away
I'm a better man now than I was that day

Let's go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café

Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drunks and the lovers appear
And take time, just the stars at the Sovereign Light Café

I wheel my bike off the train
Up the North Trade Road
Look for you on Marley Lane
In every building, every street sign
Oh why did we ever go so far from home?

You've got nothing to hide, you can't change who you really are
You can get a big house and a faster car
You can run away boy, but you won't go far

Let's go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café

Stroll down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drunks and the lovers appear
And take time, just the stars at the Sovereign Light Café

Sha la la la la la ri re
Yeah, I'm going where the people know my name
