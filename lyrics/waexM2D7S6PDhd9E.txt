The breaking light
Sparks the human strain
And it is the dawn
Relentless again

With endless arms
Hot, holy light
Radiates and then it all begins

We are as one and one is all we are
We are as one and one is all we are

Inhaling quick
When I see your being
Can t define
The divine
And I m born again
The limitless is within my reach
Particles passing through a microcosm
That is all we are

We are as one and one is all we are
We are as one and one is all we are

We are as one and one is all we are
We are as one and one is all we are

I can t define
It is divine

We are as one and one is all we are
We are as one and one is all we are

We are as one and one is all we are
We are as one and one is all we are

It is divine

We are as one and one is all we are

I can t define

We are as one and one is all we are

It is divine

We are as one and one is all we are

I can t define

We are as one and one is all we are
