(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(I gotta, I gotta keep you with me)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(I gotta, I gotta)

Catch my flight, 6 A.M.
Gonna be gone 'til who knows when
Here I go (here I go)
Squeeze you tight one last time
Use my shirt to dry your eyes
Gotta let go (gotta let go)

When I'm gone, all the nights are so long
We've got to hold on, on, on

Days go by
And yeah, I've always got you on my mind, oh
'Cause I keep you with me
I say your name
And I can't touch you but it feels the same, oh
I gotta keep you with me

Oh-oh, oh-oh
(I gotta, I gotta keep you with me)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(I gotta, I gotta)

I still smell like your perfume
Damn, I wish you were in this room
In my bed (in my bed)
I toss and turn as I try to dream
Our love plays out like a movie scene
In my head, oh yeah

Days go by
And yeah, I've always got you on my mind, oh
'Cause I keep you with me
I say your name
And I can't touch you but it feels the same, oh
I gotta keep you with me

Oh-oh, oh-oh
(I gotta, I gotta keep you with me)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(I gotta, I gotta)

When I'm gone, all the nights are so long
We've got to hold on, on, on

Catch my flight, 6 A.M.
One last stop and I'm home again
Here I go, oh

Days go by (days go by)
And yeah, I've always got you on my mind, oh
'Cause I keep you with me
I say your name (say your name)
And I can't touch you but it feels the same, oh
I gotta keep you with me
Days go by
And yeah, I've always got you on my mind, oh
'Cause I keep you with me
I say your name (I say your name)
And I can't touch you but it feels the same, oh
I gotta keep you with me
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
