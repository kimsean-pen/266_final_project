I can feel you in the raising tide
Can you feel me by the fire side

From the moonlight
Through the cherry trees
Open the roof and take in the view
'Cause you're my sweetest dream
Come true
'Cause you're my sweetest dream
Come true

Colour the dusk, deep navy blue
And try to be brave
Cause I'll be right beside you
There's a world so high
Hold out your hands
And you can go anywhere
So reach for the stars
'Cause I'll be waiting up there
And you can finally fly
Cause you'll be lighter than air

Colour the dusk, deep navy blue
And try to be brave
'Cause I'll be right beside you
There's a world so high
Hold out your hands
And you can go anywhere
So reach for the stars
'Cause I'll be waiting up there
And you can finally fly
'Cause you'll be lighter than air
'Cause you'll be lighter than air
'Cause you'll be lighter than air
