Some folks say that smokin' herb is a crime
If they catch your smokin' they're bound to drop the dime
Insufferable, informer crazy fools
Wait with their fingers crossed for you to break the rules
And in the evenin', we try to jam

We let the bass line drop as loud as we can stand
Somebody always gotta turn informer for the man
