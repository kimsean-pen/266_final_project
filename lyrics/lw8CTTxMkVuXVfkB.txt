Well you think that you can take me on
You must be Crazy
There ain't a single thing you've done
That's gonna Phase me

Oh Though if you wanna have a go
I just wanna let you know...

Yeah
Get off of my Back
And into my Game
Get out of my way
and out of my Brain
Get out of my Face
and give it your best Shot
I think it's time you better face the fact
Get off of my Back

You know that it's all just a game
That I'm Playin'
You think that you can find a way in
It's what I'm sayin'

Oh if you wanna have a go
I just wanna let you know...

Oh
Get off of my back
and into my Game
Get out of my way
and out of my Brain
Get out of my face
or give it your best shot
I think it's time you better face the fact
Get off of my Back

(Guitar Solo)

Oh
If you wanna have a go
I just wanna let you know
I just wanna let you know...

Get off
Get off
Yeah
Get off of my back
and into my Game
Get out of my way
and out of my Brain
Get out of my face
or give it your best shot
So know this train is coming of it's track
Get off of my Back

Yeah
Get off of my back
Get off
Yeah
Oh
Get off
Get off
Get off
Get off
Get off
Get off
Get off
Get Off Of My Back
