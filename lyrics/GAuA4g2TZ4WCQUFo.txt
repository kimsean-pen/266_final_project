ahh
ahh
tell me what yor gonna do now
I'm always on the west side
let me see if you can kick it again
I know what your going through now
your always on your own time
don't change but I gotta believe

tell me what your gotta do now
we'll put you on the outside
I was there when you needed a friend
tell me what I gotta prove now
it's always gona take time
can't sit here waiting for you

heeey
you don't have to be so cruel
cruel
yeaaah
you don't have to be so cruel
I'd call you - if you asked me too

I wont always be this way
can't say I'm waiting on me

tell me what you gotta lose now
you say you gotta take off
have you got somewhere better to be?
I know what I gotta do now,
It's time for me to break off
can't change how you're feeling for me

I'm calling up but you keep on pausing
taste of your lips so haunting
hoping that your falling for me
oh yeeaaahhh
you don't have to be so cruel
crueelll
yeeeaaa
you don't have to be so cruel
I wont if you ask me to

I'm calling up but you keep on pausing
taste of your lips so haunting
can't you see that your causing

I'm holding after the day
where your in
up to your chin
so stalling
can't you admit that I'm falling

I'll run away till you remember,
its not who you are but where you've beeeen

I'll run away till you remember,
because I'm flying high no time to swiiimm

ohhh
you don't have to be
I'm calling up but you keep on pausing
taste of your lips so haunting
hoping that you're falling for me
for love

you don't have to be so cruel
crueel
yeaaa
you don't have to be so cruel
I'd call you if you asked me to
you don't have to be so cruel
crueel
I'd call you if you asked me to

I'm calling up but you keep on pausing
taste of your lips so haunting
can't you see that your causing

I'm holding after the day
where your in
up to your chin
so stalling
can't you admit that your falling for me
