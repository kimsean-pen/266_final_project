yellow eyes
theres no lights in my mind flickering for you
no big candles burning bright
and no uncomfortable pews
some people waste their whole lives
being true as blue but
never in a month of sundays
could i ever find you!!!
i can't see it
can't feel it
cant hear it x 2
there's no doubt in my mind that the stories untrue
the whites of my eyes
turned em yellow for proof, for proof, for proof
oooooohhhh
i can't see it
can't feel it
can't hear it
talking tongues somethings wrong with the words
you approve
and force fed as a child
when its all a big spoof
and you know, you know that theres nothing
and you know, you know that theres nothing
yet still inside your narrow mind
someones talking to you
