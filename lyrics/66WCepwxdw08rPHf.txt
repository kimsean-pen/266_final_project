If I really wanted to
I'll be waiting for you
Yes, I really want you too
Say yeah

If I was in love with you
We'll laugh away we two
It's so hard to know it's true
Say yeah
If I will be with you
That's enough to get me through
I will make it up to you
Say yeah

On the very day we're through
We would have to say it's true
That I really want you too
Say yeah

All I want is one last chance as your lover
Baby, we'll make it together
One last chance for each other

If I really love you
I'll be waiting for you
Cause I really want you too
Say yeah

All I want is one last chance as your lover
Baby, we'll make it together
One last chance for each other
Baby, again

All I want is one last chance as your lover
Baby, we'll make it together
One last chance for each other
In the rain

All I want is one last chance as your lover...
