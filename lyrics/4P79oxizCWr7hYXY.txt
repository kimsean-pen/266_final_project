At the end,
I became them and led them.

After all, none of us really qualified
As humans

We were just hardworn,
Automatic,
And as hollow as the "o" in God.

I re-attached my emotions
Cellular
Narcotic

From the top of Hollywood,
It looked like space.
Millions of capsules,

Mechanical Animals

The city filled with dead stars
And a girl I call Coma White.

This is my Omega
