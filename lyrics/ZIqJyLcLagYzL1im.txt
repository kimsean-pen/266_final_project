all of this time i should have known, but we buried our hopes in our throats.
and though it spared us from honesty, it could not deny anything else.
after the air cleared and the anger left our bodies, we slept more soundly.
we slept more soundly!
on denton, where you realized the full weight of what you had done, you felt ashamed for the first time.
but still refused to admit that you were wrong!
i swore i would not carry your weight for you anymore when, at twenty-one, you cannot help yourself.
but in the time you were making up your mind, we still held our breath.
so history repeats, and the feeling that i will one day wake an old and empty man only drives me harder.
even if you will not sacrifice your youth, it will grow to resent you.
like a body of water, it will yield only to entrenched earth.
i swore i would not carry your weight for you anymore when, at twenty-one, you cannot help yourself.
but in the time you were making up your mind, we already knew.
