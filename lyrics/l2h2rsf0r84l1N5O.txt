Since you've been gone
you' would think I feel lonely
cry all night
lose my mind
I'm all alone and it feels like a blessing
well does that disappoint you

I put out all the stops
to feel sad to miss all we had
but I'm sorry I ain't heartbroken
I put out al the stops
To regret all the fights we had
but really I ain't heartbroken

Hey I feel great
I feel strong does it really seem so wrong
not to long
for you and the way you've been trying
to control me
well you know what
those days are over

I put out all the stops
to feel sad to miss all we had
but I'm sorry I ain't heartbroken
I put out al the stops
To regret all the fights we had
but really I ain't heartbroken
I ain't heartbroken
I ain't heartbroken

I ain't heartbroken

Sometimes you should stop to feel sad
to this lonely night

but I'm sorry I ain't heartbroken
I put out al the stops
To regret all the fights we had
but really I ain't heartbroken

Sometimes you should stop
