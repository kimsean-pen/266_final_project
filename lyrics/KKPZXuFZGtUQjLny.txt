I caught the train to your house in the hills
with a college degree and a pocket of pills
We speak in code because it gives us a thrill
love I make no money but you know I will
I go out and the rain washes all of my pain
I'd go insane if I lost you
You and I are a match made in bottles of wine
but you've got no time to see this through

Make Love Make Music
Make love there's nothing to it
Make up, push through it
Make love make music

Make Love Make Music
Make love there's nothing to it
Make up, push through it
Make love make music

Computer machine is pulling me through
and spitting me out like a fire.
No one could ever understand what you do,
you're a natural force of desire

I just Wish that I could take you to bed
dig deep in the ground and change what
I said
We are young so our faces areconstantly red
from making love to the beat in our head

Make Love Make Music
Make love there's nothing to it
Make up, push through it
Make love make music
I can see it all
It was beautiful
Like a carnival
I'm an animal

Make Love Make Music
Make love there's nothing to it
Make up, push through it
Make love make music

Make love make music
Make love make music
