I got an old black limousine
Packed my suit and pawned the last of our precious metal
And my blue eyes never looked so green
I've got a debt to pay and a date with the devil
I've got mouths to feed
I've gotta get level

Oh, Las Vegas I'm
Running out of time
And my youth is all but ashes
If I don't make church by nine
I'll be praying on the drive
Passed the lake as fake as a showgirl's lashes

That I'm gonna turn our luck around
I'm gonna take this town
I'm gonna walk these flooded streets like a king with my umbrella out
That I'm gonna turn our luck around
I'm gonna make you proud
I'm gonna walk these flooded streets like a king with my umbrella out
And the paper rain pouring down
Paper rain pouring down

I rented a room at the desert queen
I shaved my face, I comb my hair and I check the weather
And I see clouds where the mountains meet
The valley floor where the neon soars like a hand to heaven
I've got work to do
Rollin' them sevens

Oh, Las Vegas I'm
Running out of time
And my youth is all but ashes
If I don't make church by nine
I'll be praying on the drive
Passed the lake as fake as a showgirl's lashes

That I'm gonna turn our luck around
I'm gonna take this town
I'm gonna walk these flooded streets like a king with my umbrella out
Yeah I'm gonna turn our luck around
I'm gonna make you proud
I'm gonna walk these flooded streets like a king with my umbrella out
And the paper rain pouring down
Paper rain pouring down

Gotta stack on the line and a stack behind
Rolling like a wave on a moonlit night
Money on the four, money on the eight
Paying down the marker 'cause the bank won't wait
Gotta stack on the line and a stack behind
Rolling like a wave on a moonlit night
Money on the four, money on the eight
Paying down the marker 'cause the bank won't wait

I'm gonna turn our luck around
I'm gonna take this town
I'm gonna walk these flooded streets like a king with my umbrella out
Yeah I'm gonna turn our luck around
I'm gonna make you so proud
I'm gonna walk these flooded streets like a king with my umbrella out
And the paper rain pouring down
Paper rain pouring down
