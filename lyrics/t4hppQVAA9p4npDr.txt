Running I'm alway running from myself
No one to help me
No one knows
Not that anyone who knew would care

Dangling
Hanging from your tree
Am I an ornament of longing
A seed trapped inside the shell that is me
Nobody can save me
From this
From myself

Hurricane of head space
Spinning circle
Stacking up the walls that hide you from yourself
Crumbling pieces of me
An offering to you
Falling gifts from me to you
Left nothing for myself
You had my cake and ate it too
And left nothing for me

Fist
For breaking
These eyes
For seeing
Right through
Heart
For you to trample
Confidence lost
Nothing to lose
Nothing to gain
From this loss
This right of passage denied
Holding the headstone
Tied to no one
Loosen the knot
Pulling the string

Losing
Feels like I'm losing all my worth
No one to notice
No one would care
If they took the time to stop and stare

Nobody has the time for me
For myself
Blistering pieces of me
I'm giving them to you
These sweet whispers are from me to you
Want nothing for myself

You hold my world inside your hands
And leave nothing for me

Fist
For breaking
These eyes
For seeing
Right through
Heart
For you to trample
Confidence lost
Nothing to lose
Nothing to gain
From this loss
This right of passage denied
Holding the headstone
Tied to no one
Loosen the knot
Pulling the string

So sorry
For whatever it was I've done
So I'm deserting
Sincerely
Me

Got to just be
You've got to just know
I've got to leave
It's time for me to go

So here's the note
I've left the key
I hope that when you find this
I've left you with a happy ending...

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Fist
For breaking
These eyes
For seeing
Right through
Heart
For you to trample
Confidence lost
Nothing to lose
Nothing to gain
