I have never been so scared and sad at the same time.
I finally will figure out what life truly means when it's all left behind
I did not know what steps to take after graduating high school.
I never knew much of anything.
The midwest has blessed me with great friends and unforgettable relationships,
still hits my head each and everyday.

Well if these bones still hold me up, I'm fine.
If I feel this cold still buried in my throat
I guess I'll survive.
It's sad that time turns it's back on us,
like a wood chipper eating up the lumber.
It turns into dust and floats in the air
to prove what we have lost.

All of my white shirts have lost their color,
but i don't want to go to the store and spend another dollar.
Because I like the way I dress
as a matter of fact
I love for who I am.
