Crashing stone you drove me down
Beneath the snow
Will the trails of a legend
In the eyes or an ice
See the steer of the man away

I went too far
The flame into the fire
The bridges are going to light my way
A picture will desire
But screaming unless not to say
What's with the fire
Stinging out the world
Crashing stone

Am I crashing stone?
Take my belief no
Oh you take it out for me
Watching scenery breath
As they cut out weak
No flatwave the dream

We went too far
The flame into the fire
The bridges are going to light my way
A picture will desire
Screaming out unless to say
What's with the fire
Stinging out the world
Crashing stone

I went too far

I went too far
The flame into the fire
The bridges are going to light my way
A picture will desire
Screaming what's left to say
What's with the fire
Stinging out the world
Crashing stone
