Wait
And you'll see it all around you when you find
The light that makes you bloom
Before your pride
And petals start to fall around you
I can't be the one to catch them when you're crashing down

Can you break away from it all?
Can you break away from it all?
Before it drags you under

Stay
You'll feel it all around you when you find
A way to make it through
Cross the line
Don't find yourself in need of rescue
I can't be the one to catch you

Can you break away from it all?
Can you break away from it all?
Before it drags you under

(Break and separate)

Can you break away from it all?
Can you break away from it all?
(Break and separate)
Can you break away from it all?
(Break and separate)
