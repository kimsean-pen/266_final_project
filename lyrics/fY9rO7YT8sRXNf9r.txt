I'm in love with the dead man
What's the worst that could happen?
I'm in love with the dead man
They say that you're in heaven

Will I turn into stone if I sit on your grave long enough?
Will I drown from the tears if I cry over you long enough?
Will I see you above if I look at the stars long enough?
Are you with me right now but my eyes can't stay open long enough?

I'm in love with the dead man
What's the worst that could happen?
I'm in love with the dead man
They say that you're in heaven
I'm in love with the dead man
How come that I'm still breathing?
I'm in love with the dead man
Can it still be called "a feeling"?

Will it turn into dream if I sleep for a dozen nights?
It is so unreal that I won't ever feel your touch again
Are you with me right now? Can you give me a sign?
I just need to make sure that wherever you went you are all right

I'm in love with the dead man
What's the worst that could happen?
I'm in love with the dead man
They say that you're in heaven
I'm in love with the dead man
How come that I'm still breathing?
I'm in love, in love with the dead man
