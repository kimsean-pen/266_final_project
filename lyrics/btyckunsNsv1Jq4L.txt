What are you waiting for?
She's said, she's a star,
somewhere in the night time sky

Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh

The snow,
Has come down,
On top of everything
The town,
Is alive and well without you. (she's said)
The lights
They peer out
Of the leafless trees
And you won't
Be alone, I am beside you. (beside you)

Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh

(True love)
The stars in the sky, illuminate below
The light is the sign, that love will guide you home.
The stars in the sky, illuminate below
If the world were to die, the light will guide you.

Tears,
Spilling out,
Across a dead end street
Your house,
Is a lonely box that holds you. (she's a star)
A star,
Bright and loud,
Is in dire need
Of the fear,
It is an empty fear inside you.

Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh
