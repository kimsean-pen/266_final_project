Scared at night
When thoughts rush to my head
Makes me feel bad
To see the issues that i have
To face em all
Without leaving me alone
I need to be alone

Scared of growing
And being by myself
To figure out
What to do with my life
I don't wanna chose
But i can't stop thinking about it
Thinking about it

Yeah the shadows follow me
In my sleep
They never leave me
Im too deep
The shadows who show me
How scared i should be
Of what's coming next, what's coming so close to me

Yeah the shadows follow me
In my sleep
They never leave me
I'm too deep
The shadows who show me
How scared I shoud be
Of what's coming next, what's coming so close to me

Feel the need
To share what's on my mind
But i can't express
What's going on inside
It hurts so much
I don't know what to do
Dont have the words for you

And the shadows follow me
In my sleep
They never leave me
Im too deep

The shadows who show me
How scared i should be
Of what's coming next, what's coming so close to me

And the shadows follow me
In my sleep
They never leave me
I'm too deep
The shadows who show me
How scared i should be
Of what's coming next, what's coming so close to me

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

I got to move,
Go far away, go far away
I got to leave this haunted place, this haunted place
Can't seem to have an other solution
For better or for worst
I wanna hide

From the shadows who follow me
In my sleep
They never leave me
Im too deep
The shadows who show me
How scared i should be
Of what's coming next, what's coming so close to me

Yeah the shadows who follow me
In my sleep
They never leave me
Im too deep
The shadows who show me
How scared i should be
Of what's coming next, what's coming so close to me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
