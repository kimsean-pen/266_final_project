Did you know
that you make the most supersonic sound
in my heart every time that you're around
that I can't shut you down?

Did you know
that you've been led to believe in
that this happiness you shouldn't be feeling
like this love?

Did you run
'cuz you thought that you didn't deserve it
but you knew deep inside that you'd earned it?

Did you know
that you make the most supersonic sound
in my heart every time that you're around
that I can't shut you down?

We're both alone tonight
We're both alone tonight

Is that what you wanted?
Is that what you wanted?
Did you choose to choose?

Is that what you wanted?

We're both alone tonight
We're both alone tonight

Is that what you wanted?
Is that what you wanted?
Did you choose to choose?

Is that what you wanted?
Is that what you wanted?
Is that what you wanted?
Did you choose to choose?
Is that what you wanted?

Did you know
that you make the most supersonic sound
in my heart every time that you're around
that I can't shut you down?
