For all those endless nights
Looking for hope in the moonlight
For all these tears I've cried
When there was no meaning in my life

I was alone in the dark and I wanted to stay
I was obsessed, I became my own slave

From ashes to flames I'll fight to survive
You don't know how much I faced my fears
All my life I was afraid to find my place
From ashes to flames, I'll not hide my face

Prisoner of the black shadows
I was weak, trapped in illusion
I didn't know that relief was so close
Paralyzed by confusion

I was obsessed, I became my own slave

From ashes to flames I'll fight to survive
You don't know how much I faced my fears
All my life I was afraid to find my place
From ashes to flames, I'll not hide my face

But I will fall and rise again
Always stronger, I am a fighter

From ashes to flames I'll fight to survive
You don't know how much I faced my fears
All my life I was afraid to find my place
From ashes to flames, I'll not hide my face
