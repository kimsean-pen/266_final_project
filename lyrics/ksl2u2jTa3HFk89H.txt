Close friends we are
You & I
We share secrets
Tell no lies
きみは今も そう気づかない
I might pretend
Still I hide

But you don't know what you do to me
You're so cool to me
きみに私だけ見ていて欲しいのに

Tell me is there gonnabe a day for us
If I say nothing I might go crazy
気づかせるよ運命を
Maybe one day maybe one day

So much to say
How do I？
So much has changed
How times flies
誰かの話はfed up
I might pretend
Still I hide

But you don't know what you do to me
You're so cool to me
いつものようにはしゃいだ
切ない 煌めくbeach

Tell me is there gonnabe a day for us
If I say nothing I might go crazy
気づかせるよ運命を
Maybe one day maybe one day

One day I can tell you how I feel
諦めるなんてできない
友達なんかじゃいられない
Maybe one day you will understand
