Coin-operated boy
Sitting on the shelf
He is just a toy
But I turn him on and he comes to life
Automatic joy

That is why I want a
Coin-operated boy
Made of plastic and elastic
He is rugged and long-lasting
Who could ever ever ask for more
Love without complications galore
Many shapes and weights to choose from
I will never leave my bedroom

I will never cry at night again
Wrap my arms around him and pretend
Coin-operated boy
All the other real
Ones that I destroy
Cannot hold a candle to my new boy and I'll
Never let him go, and I'll never be alone
And I'll never let him go, and I'll never be alone
Go, and I'll never be alone
Go, and I'll never be alone

Go, and I'll never be alone
Go, and I'll never be alone
Not with my coin-operated boy
This bridge was written to make you feel smittener
With my sad picture of girl getting bitterer
Can you extract me from my plastic fantasy
I didn't think so but I'm still convinceable
Will you persist even after I bet you
A billion dollars that I'll never love you
And will you persist even after I kiss you
Goodbye for the last time
Will you keep on trying
To prove it?
I'm dying
To lose it...
I'm losing my confidence

I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you
I

Want
A,
I
Want
A,
I
Want
A,
I
Want
A,
Coin-operated boy
And if I had a star to wish on
For my life I cant imagine
Any flesh and blood could be his match
I can even take him in the bath
Coin-operated boy
He may not be real experienced with girls
But I know he feels like a boy should feel
Isn't that the point that is why I want a
Coin-operated boy
With his pretty coin operated voice
Saying that he loves me that hes thinking of me
Straight and to the point
That is why I want
Coin-operated boy.
