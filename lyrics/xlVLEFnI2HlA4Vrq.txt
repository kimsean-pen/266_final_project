Is it a curse?
Or the highest place?
To be delirious for days

He's diving inside my mind
Doing tidal waves
A heart before nothing could phase

Love is a disease, love is a disease
Love is a disease, love is a
But I don't need a cure I just wanna be yours
If I go I wanna be in your arms
But I don't need a cure I just wanna be yours

He's gone and got a grip on my soul
Seeping into the core of my bones

Devouring me now
Like how? I don't know
But I'm sure as hell it's nothing I slow

Love is a disease, love is a disease
Love is a disease, love is a disease
Love is a disease, love is a disease
Love is a disease, love is a

But I don't need a cure I just wanna be yours
If I go I wanna be in your arms
I don't need a cure I just wanna be yours
If I go I wanna be in your arms

You suck the air out of the room when you're walking
Never thought life could fill me with doom but it just did

Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do

But I don't need a cure I just wanna be yours
If I go I wanna be in your arms
I don't need a cure I just wanna be yours
If I go I wanna be in your arms
I don't need a cure I just wanna be yours
If I go I wanna be in your arms
I don't need a cure I just wanna be yours
If I go I wanna be in your arms
I want to be in your arms
