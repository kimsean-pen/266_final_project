I used to think that
I should be good at everything
Now I know I was wrong
I used to think that
I should do right by everyone
Now I know I was wrong
A couple of things is enough

But now I know that
Every wave is just that - cresting and crashing
If it haunted you then
Now you don't remember it

Sever every microscopic atom of connection to
"I can barely keep myself afloat when I'm not saving you"

Resurrected from the basement
I'm at capacity, I'm spilling out of me
It's got nothing to do with me

I used to think one man could fill me up
But now I know that if I'm always stuck
Obsessed with somebody else
Distracting myself from looking at myself

Sever every microscopic atom of connection to
"I can barely keep myself afloat when I'm not saving you"

Resurrected from the basement
I'm at capacity, I'm spilling out of me
Desecrated and complacent
I'm at capacity, I'm spilling out of me
It's got nothing to do with me

I was raised an East Coast witch like
Doing nothing's sacrilegious
Triple overtime ambitious
Sentimental, anxious kid
I was raised an East Coast witch like
Doing nothing's sacrilegious
Triple overtime ambitious
Sometimes nothing is delicious

Resurrected from the basement
I'm at capacity, I'm spilling out of me
Desecrated and complacent
I'm at capacity, I'm spilling out of me
It's got nothing to do with me
