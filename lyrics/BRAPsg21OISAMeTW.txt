Don't see your name, I bet you have a cool one baby
You wanna play, just whisper in my ear and maybe
Some nights I remember, some nights I forget
There's boys I like better but there's no regrets but there's no regrets

Girls, girls, wanna feel it
Hearts pumping, overheating
Girls, girls, live and breathe it
Hearts broke a million times, around
We dance it off
Girls, girls, wanna feel it
Never get enough, yeah

I lose control, I spin around in circles baby
And if I fall, I'll deal with that tomorrow, maybe
Some nights I remember, some nights I forget
There's boys I like better but there's no regrets but there's no regrets

Girls, girls, wanna feel it
Hearts pumping, overheating
Girls, girls, live and breathe it
Hearts broke a million times, around
We dance it off
Girls, girls, wanna feel it
Never get enough, yeah

Girls, girls, wanna feel it
Hearts pumping, overheating
Girls, girls, live and breathe it
Hearts broke a million times, around
We dance it off
Girls, girls, wanna feel it
Never get enough, yeah

Boy, you gotta do it right
Even if it's for one night
Boy, you gotta do it right
Even if it's for one night
