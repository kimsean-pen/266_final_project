She scratches a letter, into a wall made of stone
Maybe someday another child, won't feel as alone as she does...
It's been two years and counting
Since they put her in this place

She's been diagnosed, by some stupid fuck
And mommy agrees, yeah
Why go home, why go home, why go home?
She seems to be stronger

But what they want her to be... is weak
She could play pretend, she could join the game, boy
She could be another clone
Oh, uh, ah yeah

Why go home,
Why go home,
Why go home,
Why go home?

What you taught me (Why go home?)
Put me here (Why go home?)
Don't come visit (Why go home?)
Mother, sing it

Why go home,
Why go home,
Why go home,
Why go home?

What you taught me (Why go home?)
Put me here (Why go home?)
Don't come visit (Why go home?)
Mother, Mother, yeah

Why go home,
Why go home,
Why go home,
Why go home?
