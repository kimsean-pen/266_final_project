[Composition: Holopainen, Esa]

The Sun will rise again
When darkness can't get any darker
Shadows will retreat
When night has filled the cup of time

When pearls start to glow
When morning dewdrops glister
When the wind waves the blade of grass
The Sun will rise again

When eagles have descended by my side
When I no longer need to flee
When mountain has accepted me, I will stay
And rest for a while

This is the moment
I have always feared
Afraid of an ending night
Afraid of a closing road
This is how it feels to die
On a most beautiful day
When the clouds so white and light
Sail across the sky
