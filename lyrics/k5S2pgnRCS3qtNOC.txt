Bad love got me sick inside
There ain't no other are you satisfied
People over there talking 'bout me
Don't wanna know the things that they said
All my friends have up and left me
Darling I deserve to wake up dead
If it weren't for how you loved me - bittersweet
Got me doing things that I don't wanna do
Bittersweet 'cos it gets salty sometimes
The way you laugh at me when I make love to you
I can't stand it - don't stop
Got me in a mood
Wait a minute baby
Ok woman you're so rude
Everybody thinks I'm crazy
They say how do you stand to be in so much pain
I pick up the telephone to say it's over
Soon as I hear you talk it's started all over again
And the way that you love me - bittersweet
Got me seeing things that I don't wanna see
Bittersweet 'cos it gets salty sometimes
The way you're laughing when you're making love to me
You, you got me crawling on the floor
I never felt like this before
But I've read about it in a book somewhere
I just don't know what to do
You tell me I can leave if I want too
But you know I'm always gonna be right there
Girl I don't wanna go home
I just can't leave it alone
You could be making someone else feel just like me
You know how I feel about you baby
