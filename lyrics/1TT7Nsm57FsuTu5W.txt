Cody Banks in a secret agent outfit
It's a bag for the money that I'm makin' out with
Real shit, drop bombs when I make announcements
Need a flight, that's for me, and then I say about six
Go ahead and make 'em round trip
Doing eighty-seven, trying keep away from Crown Vics
None a-miss, swisher laying down, whip
Puerto Rican accent and the shit sound thick

Tryin' build things, know she got a past
Why she terrified to feel pain
Big checks, I been waitin' for the real change
I don't wanna' stress 'bout trying to get the bills paid
So what the deal say, let me know your thoughts
Got an Indiana chick and I don't ever go across
I ain't really into showin' off
But the show goes on, so I'm really goin' off
So tell me how you feel, what you think and what you heard
I been, I been working out the kinks
I got New B's on my feet that I ain't purchase and they pink
Got the neck lookin' like the surface of the rink, what you think
