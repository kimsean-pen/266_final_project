I know loyalty means nothin
I know I'll die for nothin
I know my word means nothin
I know I'll die for nothin

Big nuts gun tucked and I'm huntin fucks
Braveheart you will never be one of us
Won't bleed won't die won't trust
Braveheart

And our teachers would fuss and we hated their
guts cuz we didn't know our futures were bleak
And I remember to this day when we were kids
we used to play and that memory makes me weak
So I block it all out and I pull my
Glock out and I shoot in the air for the dead
And there's 21 guns in the sky and we ride
for each other till they hit me in my head

Big nuts gun tucked and I'm huntin fucks
Braveheart you will never be one of us
Won't bleed won't die won't trust
Braveheart you will never be one of us
War drums beat loud on the precipice
Braveheart you will never be one of us
Bodies fall don't give a fuck what you think of us
Braveheart

And when it rains outside my bullet wounds they
ache and I hear the sounds of thunder all around
And will it rain poison water or will it
rain lead and is it thunder or machine gun sounds
And my vision becomes blurry and I know my
mamma worries but I'm an animal and no longer a man
And the code I live by is an eye for an eye and
we're helpless and we're hopeless and we're damned

I'm alive as I'll ever be
And nobody came before me
And no god watching over me
Its blasphemy
And when I'm dead or lost in reverie just pray for my enemies
300 blackout blow your back out from the jungle to the crackhouse
"hey I'm reloaded"
I'm holding court
Oh this bloodsport
Here comes the motorcade
Oh they'll drag me away kickin and screamin
These are not demons they're dogs they come when they're called

I know loyalty means nothin
I know I'll die for nothin
To you respect means nothin
I know I'll die for nothin

Big nuts gun tucked and I'm shootin fucks
Braveheart you will never be one of us
Won't bleed won't die get fucked
Braveheart you will never be one of us
War drums beat loud on the precipice
Braveheart you will never be one of us
Bodies fall don't give a fuck what you think of us
Braveheart
