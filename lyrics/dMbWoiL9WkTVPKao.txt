I'll save you
An echo from the hall
And I'll paint you
A dreamscape on your bedroom wall

Pretend you're not alone
Like you are center stage on broadway
'Cause when you're on your own
A little opera goes a long way

I'll meet you
Where the page proclaims the end
And I'll make do
With the fractions my reactions bend

Pretend you're not alone
Like you are center stage on broadway
'Cause when you're on your own
A little opera goes a long way

I'll capsize
This highrise
And weld a cablecar
Then I'll drive down
To some southwestern town
And end up where you are

Pretend you're not alone
Like you are center stage on broadway
'Cause when you're on your own
A little opera goes a long way

I'll reset
Your silhouette
And be your parasol
So hold on to
Your flourescent view
And if you slip and fall
I will catch you
