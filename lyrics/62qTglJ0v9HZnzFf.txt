Hoo
Hm
Hey, yeah

I can't imagine
Looking in someone else's eyes
What we have surpasses
Even paradise
It's hard to fathom
Reaching for someone else's hand
What we share is magic
Heaven had a plan

Sent from up above
(Sent from up above)
So much love
In my life
(Hooo, hooo)
I can't get enough
(Just can't get enough)
Of your touch-feels so right

Unending passion
Somehow the fire never dies
What we share
Is everlasting
Love without demise
Oh yes!
He made it happen
Placed so much joy into our hands
What we dreamed
We finally captured
Heaven took command
