Hope that I was right and she's smooth sailin' these concrete seas
Now she headin' East down the boulevard
Said I like the way, said I like the way you sail your ship down
Let me be your captain, I won't break it down, no-oh
Honey I won't let you down
I don't really know her destination,
But I got a feeling I, I'm gonna be her passenger
Could you let me your passenger? Oh, sure!
Said I like the way, said I like the way you sail your ship down
Let me be your captain, I won't break it down, no-oh
Honey I won't let you down
She's smooth, smooth sailin'
(Smooth sailin' yeah)
She's smooth, smooth... darling
Sweet pretty baby, won't you be my lady? Oh ooh oh
Sweet honey darling, you know I'm calling,
I want you, oh sure!
Said I like the way, said I like the way you sail your ship down
Let me be your captain, I won't break it down, no-oh
Honey I won't let you down
She's smooth, smooth sailin'
(Smooth sailin' yeah)
She's smooth, smooth... darling
Sweet pretty baby, won't you be my lady? Oh ooh oh
Sweet honey darling, you know I'm calling,
