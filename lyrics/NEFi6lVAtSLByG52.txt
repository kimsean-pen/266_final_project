It's been a few years
Since I packed my bags
Left all I knew
This fear to define the life
That's built on breaking through
How much longer will it take?
No I can't wait forever
A picture painted in my mind

It seems like days are numbered
And maybe you're the one who's scared
Of all that we could be?
And maybe you're the one who left me
On no hands and feet
Believe me when the weight
Is far too much to take
I won't collapse for anything

You fall
There's a quiver in your voice
That I read
Give up

Don't you think it's time you came back
Home to me?
You've been chasing a dream
But dreams don't last forever
Though it means more than anything

At least we'll have each other
And maybe you're the one who's scared
Of all that we could be?
And maybe you're the one who left me
On no hands and feet
Believe me when the weight
Is far too much to take

I won't collapse for anything
Heart beats slow
Got me with a gun
It's taken long enough to give in

Will I be better off?
God we're not alone
Here without a home?
I'll still be what I can
Whilst shaking
While I'm bleeding at the stake
And I don't know anymore
What I'm really fighting for
Is this bigger than the both of us?

You're the only one I trust
Anymore
And maybe you're the one who's scared
Of all that we could be?
And maybe you're the one who left me
On no hands and feet
Believe me when the weight

Is far too much to take
I won't collapse for anything
And what kills me
Is how could you forget me?
It was different when you left me
All my wounds could heal
But you're still tearing them apart
And what kills me
Is to define what's left
And I refuse to (?) another heart
