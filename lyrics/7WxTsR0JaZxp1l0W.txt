I see a problem I'm not willing to adress
And I take pleasure in not wanting to impress
Cuz I'm drinking from the fountain of good fortune
And i see beauty and technology
in the simple sense amount of history
and its all too easy with the privilege of the fountain of good fortune
I've been washed, I've been anointed
I've eaten the body of the Lord
It's from the fountain of good fortune
Brings dirty, cloudy water
That pollutes the mind of anyone around.
Holding on to my own, burn it down when I'm gone
Holding on to my own,
Holding on
Holding on to my own, burn it down when I'm gone
Holding on to my own,
Holding on
Holding on to my own, (Times have been wierd)
burn it down when I'm gone
(Back to the morge)
Holding on to my own, (Tune out the solitude)
Holding on

Holding on to my own, (Times have been wierd)
burn it down when I'm gone
(Back to the morge)
Holding on to my own, (Tune out the solitude)
Holding on
