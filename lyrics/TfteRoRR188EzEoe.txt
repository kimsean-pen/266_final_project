It's been awhile, I should be moved on
'Cause I shouldn't be writing you this song
Haven't crossed my mind for so long
But tonight you're the movie, I want to leave on

Not enough rooms in this house
To hold all the treasures we found
Evidence all surround
Your fingerprints all over who I am now

You,
We wished only stars they were ours they remind me of you
I'm still letting you go I just want you to know
That I think of you, think of you
Think of you, think of you

The space in the back of my mind
I meet you there to reminisce from time to time
That you were the light, the blue in my skies
I saw the shades of myself in your eyes

You,
We wished only stars they were ours they remind me of you
I'm still letting you go I just want you to know
That I think of you, think of you
I think of you, think of you
I think of you, oh
I think of you, I think of you

Think of you, think of you
Think of you, think of...

You,
We wished only stars they were ours they remind me of you
I'm still letting you go I want you to know, yeah
We wished only stars they were ours they remind me of you, yeah
I'm still letting you go I want you to know
That I think of you, think of you
I think of you, I think of you
