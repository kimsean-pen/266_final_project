I woke up early Christmas morn' in my bed
Never felt so doggone good
Cause I got everything I need

It's right, with my baby
It's understood

Ain't taking no train
Ain't booking no plane
You know what I'm sayin'
My baby got candy cane

Some people wanna go where the snow falls down
Climb up on a mountain in the sky
Sip cocoa in a toe chalet
But at home with you
It's my favorite holiday

It ain't like I ain't never been nowhere
Coast to coast and around the world
Stay home with my precious damn diamonds and pearls

(La La La La)
Ain't taking no train
(La La La La)
Ain't booking no plane
You know what I'm sayin'
My baby got candy cane

Some people wanna go where the snow falls down
Climb up on a mountain in the sky
Sip cocoa in a toe chalet
But at home with you
It's my favorite holiday
Some people wanna get on with family
Take off to an island in the sun
Jump into the Panama Bay
But at home with you
It's my favorite holiday

It's my favorite holiday
(At home with you!)
It's my favorite fa-favorite

Some people wanna go where the snow falls down
Climb up on a mountain in the sky
Sip cocoa in a toe chalet
But at home with you
It's my favorite holiday
Some people wanna get on with family
Take off to an island in the sun
Jump into the Panama Bay
But at home with you
It's my favorite holiday
