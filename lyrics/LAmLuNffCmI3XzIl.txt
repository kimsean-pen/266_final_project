I said, Babe
Well, aren't we a little bit old now
For this crazy game?
Is it safe now that winter's gone?
But I think we could use a little memory
To add to the database

I saved a little bit of money
I put it in a vault
Hidden behind the face on the red room wall
I took everything I wanted
I took everything I need
All in a day
Or maybe they just want me to leave

All of the people
All of the people stand
Stand in the way
They're waiting for the concrete to break

And all of the people
And all of the people take
Take it away
You know, maybe you just made me believe

And the days
The days feel a little bit longer now
And the morning's bright
If we escape now
And leave this place
I hope heaven has another open door for us
When the day is getting late

I saved a little bit of money
I put it in a vault
Hidden behind the face on the red room wall
I took everything I wanted
I took everything I need
All in a day
Or maybe they just want me to leave

All of the people
All of the people stand
Stand in the way
They're waiting for the concrete to break

And all of the people
And all of the people take
Take it away
You know, maybe you just made me believe

Woke up late, still half asleep
But the airport line, out in the street
Baby, I know you wanted to stay
But the weekend rush won't let us wait

We woke up late, still half asleep
But the airport line, out in the street
Baby, I know you wanted to stay
But the weekend rush won't let us wait

All of the people
All of the people stand
Stand in the way
They're waiting for the concrete to break

And all of the people
And all of the people take
Take it away
You know, maybe you just made me believe
