I'm hiding in the corner
Of an overgrown garden
Covering my body in leaves
And trying not to breath
All my childhood dreams
Are bursting at the seams
And dangling around my knees
I've been deformed by emotional scars
And the cancer of love has eaten out my heart
I've been stripped bare and nobody cares
And all the people I looked up to are no longer there

All desires have been denied to put me in this state of mind
Another year older and what have I done
My aspirations have shriveled in the sun
I'm crippled by guilt
Blinded by science
I've been waiting for tomorrow all of my life

(?) working, keep talking.

All desires have been denied to put me in this state of mind
Another year older and what have I done
My aspirations have shriveled in the sun
I'm crippled by guilt
Blinded by science
I've been waiting for tomorrow all of my life

I've been filled with useless information
Spewed out by papers and radio stations
I've been hounded by fairweather friends
Sowing the seeds for my discontent
Life is like a sewer
And I'm trying to wade thru her
I threw in my money and made my wish
But sleeping boys catch no fish

All desires have been denied to put me in this state of mind
Another year older and what have I done
My aspirations have shriveled in the sun
I'm crippled by guilt
Blinded by science
I've been waiting for tomorrow all of my life

(?) working, keep talking.
(x4~5)

All my childhood dreams
Are sinking round my knees

My mind has been polluted
And my energy diluted
