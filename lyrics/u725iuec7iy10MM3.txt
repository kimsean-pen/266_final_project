Perfume don't smell like daisies
I'm feeling insecure
And everybody's aging
Cause no one wins that war
I've got that nagging feeling
I'll die from painful cause
Don't feel like anybody
Could love me anymore

So tell me, have you really got it figured out?
I want it all
You can't remember what it's really all about
I wanted more
If this is all there is then you can count me out
I want it all
Just another whisper trying to be a shout
I'm more

Stone walls and echo's fading
White lines and open source
Smile for the camera baby
Accept your false awards
Douse me in milk and honey
I have become a bore
It feels like everybody
Keeps taking more and more

So tell me, have you really got it figured out?
I want it all
You can't remember what it's really all about
I wanted more
If this is all there is then you can count me out
I want it all
Just another whisper trying to be a shout
I'm more

So tell me, have you really got it figured out?
I want it all
You can't remember what it's really all about
I wanted more
If this is all there is then you can count me out
I want it all
Just another whisper trying to be a shout
I'm more

I
Can't
Be
My
Self
To
Give
You
Up
