Picture the contents of your swollen skull
Splattered across your front door, I know life
Only demeans, only degrades you
Falling asleep only delays it for so long
Then, there you are
Back on shit street
With a bag on your head
And a gun in your hand
Suffering in silence
My burden
Is I have failed to keep you down
Look at you trying so hard to feel alive
One door closes
Given the fact you're still here drawing breath
Given the fact that each year gets harder you're
Hoping for truth, hoping for relevance
Yellow and blue, the last time you fell you realized you're home
Bathed in neon
Behind the eight ball again
No one cares now
I have failed to keep you down
Look at you trying so hard to feel alive
One more rejection
And one by one your virtues slip away
You feel cold and dejected but
Nothing hurts you now
Nothing makes you ashamed now
One door opens
