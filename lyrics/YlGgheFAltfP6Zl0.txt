I'm getting pretty good at leaving
My patience isn't running thin
Autumn never ends in my head
No matter how far I've been
It feels like everybody is the branch
And I'm the leaves falling from the top
Of every leafless tree

The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see

All I see is the past two years before I hit the ground
Time is moving slower on the way down
Save yourself
Don't stand wondering what's going through my mind
Let me go before you see me following behind

I'll save you from myself
Just let me go
I'll save you from myself

The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see

I've learned that it's okay to be selfish
It keeps me from falling apart at the seams
Stuck is where I feel in place
A feeling I'll embrace

The home inside my head has a bed for me
That no one will ever get the chance to see
A kitchen table with one chair
Walls with empty picture frames
No one will ever see
No one will ever see
