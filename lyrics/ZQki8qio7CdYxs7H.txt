(These are the moments I'm missing)
(These are the moments I'm missing)

I had a dream
I had a dream when I was only five
To work at a bar, I wanted to see over the other side
And I had a friend, her name was
Fern and she had a blue bike
So we'd ride through the streets
And I would sleep over on Saturday nights

Then I went to school
My family moved to a village nearby
At thirteen years old I started
Drawing black under my eyes
'Cause I met a boy, first time I kissed him
Well it was the last
'Cause I got afraid when everyone
There started moving too fast

These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I never took in
When I was just standing there wishing
I could grow up and my life would be different
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments

'Cause I've been so caught in the motion
Forgetting right where my home is
Woah woah woah
These are the moments I'm missing

In the back of her mum's car on
The way to the old bars, yeah
Raising my anxiety using her sisters ID, yeah
In a skintight short skirt, sixteen and
We danced 'till our feet hurt
But I had a dream, I had a goal
Got a guitar and a camera phone

Then over the time I started
Racking up numbers online
At the end of July I met somebody
Who changed my life
And then I was signed and
Falling in love for the very first time
But that fucked me up so then
I had issues with falling in love

These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I never took in
When I was just standing there wishing
I could grow up and my life would be different
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments

'Cause I've been so caught in the motion
Forgetting right where my home is
Woah woah woah
These are the moments I'm missing

Woah woah woah
Now these are the moments I'm missing

'Cause I've been so caught in the motion
Forgetting right where my home is
Woah woah woah
These are the moments I'm missing
'Cause I've been so caught in the motion
Forgetting right where my home is (Ah ah)
Woah woah woah (Yeah yeah)
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
