Switchblade smiles, they go on for miles and will be forever
Now we stand together, there's no denials
Much too soon for the wooden spoon, can you hear the knocking
Now your feet are stomping around the room (Oh! Oh!)
Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it coming?

Move back his wrecking ball, reach through the package
More violence he's coming, he's coming, he's coming
Move back his wrecking ball, reach through the package
More violent he's coming, I'm running, I'm running

Switchblade smiles, they go on for miles and will be forever
Now we stand together, there's no denials
Much too soon for the wooden spoon, can you hear the knocking
Now your feet are stomping around the room
Ring a ring o' roses, a pocket full of posies
You form disguises (Can you feel it coming? Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it coming? Can you feel it coming?)
No one needs to know (Can you feel it coming? Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it coming? Can you feel it coming?)

All you wanna do it cos you said it's a lie
You're walking for your people on a warning sky
And all you wanna say "Boy, I've got no soul"
And time it for the people is full of contol

Move back his wrecking ball, reach through the package
More violence he's coming, he's coming, he's coming
Move back his wrecking ball, reach through the package
More violent he's coming, I'm running, I'm running
