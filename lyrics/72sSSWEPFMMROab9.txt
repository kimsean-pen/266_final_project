in my mind I always thought I was a different kind
cause back in time I used to think that everyone was blind
they always call me as a loser. zero
when I look into the mirror there's a superhero
people thought that I would never amount to anything
dream away the thing my thoughts were different then
never could express myself to differ words right
but I'm a different man when day turns to night

you think I'm crazy, that I've lost my senses
the world finally will finaly learn the truth

you wouldn't understand cause you don't know who I am
I'm the wonderman
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm gonna take a stand
I'm the wonderman

kind of shy, kind of timid, not a go getter
everynight I roam the streets try to make it better
hate slow me up I never was bitter
always fighting for what's right, but I'm not a quitter
when you step into my world you might not understand
everybody's acting crazy, getting out of hand
I might? off beat but I will maked
Just make it easy for the underdogs that take it

you think I'm crazy, that I've lost my senses
the world finally will finaly learn the truth

you wouldn't understand cause you don't know who I am
I'm the wonderman
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm gonna take a stand
I'm the wonderman

this my... my story, I'm not out of glory
this my... my story, I'm not out of glory
this my... my story, I'm not out of glory
this my... my story, I'm not out of glory
this my... my story, I'm not out of glory
this my... my story, I'm not out of glory

you wouldn't understand cause you don't know who I am
I'm the wonderman
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm gonna take a stand
I'm the wonderman
