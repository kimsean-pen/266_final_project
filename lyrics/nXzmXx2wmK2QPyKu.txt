Will you let me change
I want to but I think you want me the same
And I know that it's not a game
I want move really slow
And while I dance can I tell you about control
Of my body and the eyes on my soul
Would you control me
Would you lock me up and never set me free
Would I am on my knees
Is this going too slow?
You think so but we won't speed it up
No, noooo
Cause I like it when the song goes slow
Can I try to be you?
Can I dress up in your clothes and be somebody new?
Can I dance in care of your shoes?
