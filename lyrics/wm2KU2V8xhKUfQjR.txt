You're awful bright, you're awful smart
I must admit you broke my heart
The awful truth is really sad
I must admit I was awful bad

While lovers laugh and music plays
I stumble by and I hide my pain
Hmm
The lights are lit, the moon is gone

I think I've crossed the Rubicon
I, I, I, I, I, I,

I walk the streets of love and they're full of tears
I, I, I, I, I, I
I walk the streets of love and they're full of fears
While music pumps from passing cars
A couple watch me from a bar
A band just played the wedding march

And the corner store mends broken hearts
And a woman asks me for a dance

Oh, it's free of charge, just one more chance
Oh, But I, I, I, I, I, I,

I walk the streets of love and they're full of tears
I, I, I, I, I, I,
I walk the streets of love for a thousand years
Oh, tell me now

Oh, I walk the streets of love, yeah and they're drenched with tears
You had the moves, you had the cards

I must admit you were awful smart
The awful truth is awful sad
I must admit I was awful bad
And I, I, I, I, I, I
I walk the streets of love and they're drenched with tears
And I, I, I, I, I, I
I walk the streets of love for a thousand years

Oh, And I, I, I, I, I, I
I walk the streets of love and they're drenched with tears
Oh, I, I, I, I, I, I
Oh, there's only one and not enough for him
Oh I, I, I, I, I, I
Yeah and they're full of tears
Oh, everybody talk about it
Everybody be walking down it
Yeah but I found out
Oh, yes that I
Oh yes I do
Oh, I, I, I the streets of love, yeah, they're drenched with, drenched in tears...
Oh yeah I don't want to...
