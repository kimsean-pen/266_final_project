Now I sleep in the belly of woman
And I sleep in the belly of man
And I sleep in the belly of rhythm
And I sleep in the belly of love
I sleep in the belly of oceans
I sleep in the belly of truth
I sleep in the belly of kindness
And I sleep in the belly of you

I'm just a little boy
I'm just a little boy
I'm not human
I'm not human
I need love!
I need love!
