The song came and went like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
I laughed and she'd smile, it would last for awhile
You don't know what you got till you lose it all again

Listen to the mandolin rain, listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind, sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to go

A cool evening dance listening to the bluegrass band
Takes the chill from the air till they play the last song
I'll do my time, oh keeping you off my mind
But there's moments that I find, I'm not feeling so strong

Listen to the mandolin rain, listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind, sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to go

Running down by the lake shore
She did love the sound of a summer storm
It played on the lake like a mandolin
Now it's washing her away once again, again

Whoa oh oh
Yeah, listen to
Do, do, do

The boat's steaming in, I watch the side wheel spin
And I think about her when I hear that whistle blow
I can't change my mind, oh I knew all the time
That she'd go, but that's a choice I made long ago

Listen to the mandolin rain, listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind, sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to go, as she turns to go

Listen to the, listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to go
Listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to go
Listen to the mandolin rain
