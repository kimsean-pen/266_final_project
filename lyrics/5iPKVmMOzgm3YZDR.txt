I wish I would've laid my hands on
Shown you a thing or two
I wish I would've pushed you against the wall
Lock the door and bathroom stall, windows and the screen

I wish you would've laid your hands on me
That kind gon' bring me to my knees
I wish I would've let you lay me down
Cause I wouldn't be here wishing now
I wish I would've laid my hands on you

I wish I was still half drunk
Still tangled up
Still making love
But instead I'm alone in bed with you in my head
Can't get you out of my head
Mmm, mmm
My only regret

I wish I would've laid my hands on you
Got you high in a motel room
Little secret for my soul
No one sees and no one knows
Forbidden company
I wish you would've laid your hands on me
And never let me go
Drawing pictures on my skin
Places no one's ever been
I wish I would've laid my hands on you

I wish I was still half drunk
Still tangled up
Still making love
But instead I'm alone in bed with you in my head
Can't get you out of my head
Mmm, mmm
My only regret

I wish I would've laid my hands on
Shown you a thing or two
I wish I would've pushed you against the wall
Lock the door and bathroom stall, windows and the screen
I wish you would've laid your hands on me
That kind gon' bring me to my knees
I wish I would've let you lay me down
'Cause I wouldn't be here wishing now
I wish I would've laid my hands on you
