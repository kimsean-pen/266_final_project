The air was light
The waves were falling
And I looked up
And you picked my hand up

We made it on up there
And stood in the moment
And I could feel you breathing
Such a beautiful feeling

But did we make it to the top?
And did I feel your hand drop?
Because I don't remember where we stood up there
I don't remember if we stood up there

I don't remember where we stood up there
I don't remember if we stood up there
I don't remember if we stood up there
I don't remember if we stood
