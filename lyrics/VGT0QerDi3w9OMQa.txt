Your past is catching up
And you're running so quick out of luck
Your past is catching up
And you're running, you're running

Burnt all your bridges down
To make you feel alive
Break your spine
So you don't have to walk the line

You disappear without a trace
Abandoning the ones that needed you close
When you're the only one you live for
No one will remember your name

You're intoxicated
On your fear and pain
You're infatuated
With your guilt and shame
Feeling sorry for yourself
While the world is dying around you
Sorry I can't help you
This is how it ends

The voices will not leave your head
With opens arms, you welcomed them
They'll chew you up, leave you for dead
A taste of your own medicine
Every moment feels like it might be your last
No one has your back
Every moment feels like a heart attack
That's what you get when you walk on this crooked path
You disappear without a trace
Abandoning the ones that needed you close
When you're the only one you live for
No one will remember your name

You're intoxicated
On your fear and pain
You're infatuated
With your guilt and shame
Feeling sorry for yourself
While the world is dying around you
Sorry I can't help you
This is how it ends

There's nowhere else that you can go
You're on your own when you get this low
You can swallow your pride to turn the tide
But you'd rather choke
Hate to see you get what you deserve
But you lit the match and you let it burn
You're your own worst enemy
So don't take your anger out on me

There's nowhere else that you can go
You're on your own when you get this low
You can swallow your pride to turn the tide
But you'd rather choke You're intoxicated
On your fear and pain
You're infatuated
With your guilt and shame
Feeling sorry for yourself
While the world is dying around you
Sorry I can't help you
This is how it ends
Sorry I can't help you
This is how it ends
