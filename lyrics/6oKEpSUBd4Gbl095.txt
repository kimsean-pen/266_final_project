I was dead to you
You were dead to me
Call it black and blue
Go down easily
I think I lost myself
Am I too far gone?
You met someone else
And it's been so damn long, babe

Want you to want me
Want you to need me
I swear that's the truth
Hoping you call me
Know when you see me
I'll be there for you
I was dead to you
You were dead to me
We were black and blue
We were black and blue

Our love is six feet under
Yeah it makes me wonder
We could resurrect it tonight
It's been an endless slumber
Fools when we were younger
Never should have said our goodbyes
So baby won't you lay me down
Pull my heart right out the ground
Our love is six feet under
Yeah it makes me wonder
We could resurrect it tonight

Smoke inside our lungs
I could use your touch
Damn I'm such a lush
In this moonlit dance
Give me one more chance
Been sleeping with your ghost every night

Want you to want me
Want you to need me
I swear that's the truth
Hoping you call me
Know when you see me
I'll be there for you
Smoke inside our lungs
I could use your touch
I could use your touch

Our love is six feet under
Yeah it makes me wonder
We could resurrect it tonight
It's been an endless slumber
Fools when we were younger
Never should have said our goodbyes
So baby won't you lay me down
Pull my heart right out the ground

Our love is six feet under
Yeah it makes me wonder
We could resurrect it tonight
It's been an endless slumber
Fools when we were younger
Never should have said our goodbyes
So baby won't you lay me down
Pull my heart right out the ground
Our love is six feet under
Yeah it makes me wonder
We could resurrect it tonight

So can we bring it back to life?
Can we bring it back to life?
Zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie
Can we bring it back to life?
Can we bring it back to life?
Zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie

Our love is six feet under
Yeah it makes me wonder
Maybe we could resurrect it tonight
It's been an endless slumber
Fools when we were younger
No we never should have said our goodbyes
So baby won't you lay me down
Pull my heart right out the ground
Our love is six feet under
Yeah it makes me wonder
We could resurrect it tonight
It's been an endless slumber
Fools when we were younger
Never should have said our goodbyes
So baby won't you lay me down (baby won't let you lay me down)
Pull my heart right out the ground (pull my heart right out the ground)
Our love is six feet under
Yeah it makes me wonder
We could resurrect it tonight
