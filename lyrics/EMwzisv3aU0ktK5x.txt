Four walls where I wanna stay
sweat drip lick roleplay
the chase (woah)
the chase (take that)
back it up like a valet
my mustang sally
the race
the race
say my name
maybe when the sun goes down
lately you're my sole surround
say my name
gonna put your head in the clouds
never let you fall right now
say my name
maybe when the sun does down
lately you're my sole surround
say my name
gonna put your head in the clouds
never let you fall right now
say my name
(la la la)
say my name
(la la la)
say my name
(la la la)
say my name
(la la la)
say my name
four doors where I wanna play
dip down trip all day
the chase
the chase
take that
ride rough in the valley
one for the tally
the race
the race
say my name
now everything moves slow
number from my head to toes I just
wanna taste
take me lets float away
now let this feeling grow
you don't need anything but I do
ooh but I do
now we may
clap clap clap clap clap
clap clap clap clap clap
you'll give me everything
I'll give you anything
maybe when the sun goes down
lately you're my sole surround
say my name
gonna put your head in the clouds
never let you fall right now
say my name
maybe when the sun goes down
lately you're my sole surround
say my name
gonna put your head in the clouds
never let you fall right now
say my name
(la la la)
say my name
(la la la)
say my name
(la la la)
say my name
(la la la)
say my name
(la la la)
say my name
(la la la)
