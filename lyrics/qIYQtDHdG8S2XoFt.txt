You must be somewhere in London, you must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London, walking Abbey Lane
I don't even think to make, I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make corrections

Famous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles cathedral
Minor singing airheads sing for me

Put an ocean and a river between everybody else
Between everything, yourself, and home
Put an ocean and a river
Between everything, yourself, and home

You must be somewhere in London, you must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London, walking Abbey Lane
I don't even think to make, I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make corrections

Famous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles cathedral
Minor singing airheads sing for me

Afraid of the height, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the height, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the height, 'cause they're desperate to entertain

Afraid of the height, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the height, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the height, 'cause they're desperate to entertain

Afraid of the height, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the height, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the height 'cause they're desperate to entertain

Afraid of the height, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the height, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the height, 'cause they're desperate to entertain
