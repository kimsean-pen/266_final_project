I keep reaching
But you're not reaching back
You're not reaching back
Trying to get in, find you through the cracks
Find you through the cracks

Guess I'm trying to say (Guess I'm trying to say)
It hurts to feel this far (It hurts to feel this far)
A million miles away
Next to me, next to me you are
And if you're sitting right here

Then why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?
If you're so near
Then why do you feel this far?
Why are we worlds apart?

Oh, we're not that different you know
I play in the stars and then fall so low
I try to make sense as I go
'Cause nothing, 'Cause nothing, 'Cause nothing is in your soul

Why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?
(Why are we?)
Why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?

Guess I'm trying to say (Guess I'm trying to say)
It hurts to feel this far (It hurts to feel this far)
A million miles away
Next to me, next to me you are
And if you're sitting right here
Why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?

If you're so near
Then why do you feel this far?
Why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?
(Why are we?)
Why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?
