On a wind that is sailing through the morning
I have cut the harness off of my heart
On a tide that's rising with the dawning
I find I belong inside the dark

And when the waves roll in to cover me in shame
I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain
I am just another ripple in the current of an age
Another crossed out name on another wrinkled page

Carry me home

There is a dream that tells me I am haunted
It comes to visit every fortnight or so
I wake up having lost all I have ever wanted
And a bleak apparition wants what I hold

And when the waves roll in to cover me in shame
I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain
I am just another ripple in the current of an age
Another crossed out name on another wrinkled page

Carry me home

Should it disappear, should it go away
Would it mend the wounds I bare, the wounds of love
Could it reappear like a familiar tale?
Like a broken friendship that snuffs the moonlight above
