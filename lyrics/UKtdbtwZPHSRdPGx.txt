Not enough colors in the world, thought I would invent some
Or fade to black, jump-cut to alone, cross-fade to emotion
If it hurts, then baby you're all I need
I'm thinking reality could make it– make it complete
If it hurts, then baby you're all I need
I'm thinking reality could make it– make it complete
Not afraid to show myself the truth, to see what I've been missing
But then again, that midnight I was in was so much more appealing...
If it hurts, then baby you're all I need
I'm thinking reality could make it– make it complete
If it hurts then baby you're all I need
I'm thinking reality could make it– make it complete
