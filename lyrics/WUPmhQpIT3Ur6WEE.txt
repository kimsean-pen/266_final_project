They hung a sign up in out town
If you live it up, you won't
Live it down
So, she left Monte Rio, son
Just like a bullet leaves a gun
With charcoal eyes and monroe hips
She went and took that California trip
Well, the moon was gold, her
Hair like wind
She said don't look back just
Come on Jim

Oh you got to
Hold on, hold on
You got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
You gotta hold on

Well, he gave her a dime-store watch
And a ring made from a spoon
Everyone is looking for someone to blame
But you share my bed, you share my name
Well, go ahead and call the cops
You don't meet nice girls in coffee shops
She said baby, I still love you
Sometimes there's nothin' left to do

Oh but you got to
Hold on, hold on
Baby got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here,
You got to hold on

Well, God bless your crooked little heart
St. Louis got the best of me
I miss your broken China voice
How I wish you were still here with me
Oh, you build it up, you wreck it down
Then you burn your mansion to the ground
Oh, there's nothing left to keep you here
But when you're falling behind in this big blue world

Oh, you've got to hold on, hold on
Babe, you gotta hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
You gotta hold on

Down by the Riverside Motel,
It's 10 below and falling
By a 99 cent store she closed her eyes
And started swaying
But it's so hard to dance that way
When it's cold and there's no music
Well your old hometown is so far away
But inside your head there's a record
That's playing, a song called

Hold on, hold on
Baby got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
You got to hold on

You got to hold on
Hold on,
Baby got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
You got to hold on

You got to hold on
Hold on,
Baby got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
You got to hold on
You got to hold on

You got to hold on
You got to hold on
You got to hold on
You got to hold on
You got to hold on baby
You got to hold on girl
You got to hold on
You got to hold on
