Spend more on nuclear war
If that's your chosen illusion
Incinerate innocent men and women and children
The kids around here have the best idea

They say presidents come, presidents go

But all the young people they must fall in love
All the young people they must fall in love
Presidents come, presidents go
And oh, the damage they do

They never stop talking
But they aren't allowed to say
They can't say what they really mean
Do you ever say what you really feel?

All presidents come, presidents go
All the young people must fall in love
So what do you want to do?
It's up to you

Presidents come, presidents go
And nobody remembers their name
Two weeks after they go

All the young people they must fall in love
All the young people they must fall in love
All the young people must fall in love
In love, in love, in love
