If I could frame you
It would be the only way to keep you in once place,
But I couldn't blame you for running away
You say, "We'll be alone someday",
This is directly from every conversation
That we should've had, but don't tell me, don't tell me

I am your childhood home,
Empty like the words you said
But you couldn't leave me alone,
Because I was a wreck and you were the savior type

You are polished and proud
You took the words from my mouth
So I started writing them down
In hopes to somehow figure you out

This is a false content, this is a last attempt
Fire walk with me until I'm dead

And I started this fire and I watched it burn to the ground
And I started this fire and I watched it burn to the ground
And I started this fire and I watched it burn to the ground
And I started this fire and I watched it burn to the ground
