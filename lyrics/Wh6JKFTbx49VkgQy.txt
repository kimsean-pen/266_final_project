Western movie

The riders ride into the night
Into the West to see whose gun's the best

They're all fools
To live by rules
The rider wearing black
Know he's gonna shoot you in the back, hey

The horseman turns, the wound that burns
The awful pain, the crimson rain

He got to realise
Before he dies
The rider wearing black
Know he's gonna, gonna shoot you in the back, hey

It's suicide to live on pride
You claim your own, your skin, your bone

Your own life
Cuts you like a knife
The rider wearing black
He's gonna, he's gonna shoot you in the back, hey
