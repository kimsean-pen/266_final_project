Fate unknown said I'll settle for alone
Set in stone say we dunno we dunno we dunno
Come alone [along?] if you fall you'll be undone
Stretch and strung saying oh no oh no oh no

It's a thinking a feeling that's so hard for me to say
A symbol of home life and you can't take that away
I gotta think of the small things it's got 4 small bins with clothes in it and a bullet face for your neighbor

Name [every [?] caught up]
parade all you want love cause I started a fire in my mind
Take all you can do
Complain if you want to cause I black fur rise and fall. Rise and fall. Rise and fall

Fate unknown say you'll settle for alone
Set in stone say we dunno we dunno we dunno
Come alone if you fall you'll be undone
Stretched and strung saying oh no no oh no no oh no no

Say you were caught up
Parade all you want love cause I started a fire in my mind
Take all you can do
Complain if you want to cause I black fur
Rise and fall 9x
