What's done is done
I just can't fight it no more
So, I'm walking downtown to the store
And I'm buying a gun

This just ain't no fun
My life has become a bore
Pacing back and forth on the floor
Thinking of someone

Why do I feel that nothing is real
And nobody is there to hear?
Something goes wrong and I can't hear the song
That you used to sing in my ear

What's done is done
I just can't fight it no more
So, I'm walking downtown to the store
And I'm buying a gun
(Yeah)

Why do I feel that nothing is real
And nobody is there to hear?
Something goes wrong and I can't hear the song
That you used to sing in my ear

What's done is done
I just can't fight it no more
So, I'm walking downtown to the store
And I'm buying a gun

Either you go or I go
And it won't be me
