Yeah, maybe torn
But it seemed like hurting
I've been struggling
I've been moving
Lay me down
In the fire cooking
I ain't pushing

Yeah, for the time it was good
When you feel like kicking
It's your destiny
When you feel like kicking
It lays down
In the fires cooking
I've been moving
Barely hanging on
I've been struggling
It's my destiny
I got ring-side
Seats to the game
Man, I feel like kicking
Just a slave to the game
