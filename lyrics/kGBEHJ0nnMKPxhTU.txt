Slipping slowly backward
Across an open floor
I should have done much better
I should have done much more
There was no reason for it
No sacred alibi
No possibility of
Living a perfect lie

I should have asked for more
I should have asked for more
I should have asked for more
I should have asked for more
I should have asked for more
I should have asked for more
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut oh-oh-out

Slipping quickly backward
Into a darkened cave
Ignore the standards by which
We are meant to behave
I wish you did not worry
I always knew you would
A permanent condition
To be misunderstood

I should have asked for more
I should have asked for more
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut out for this
I should have asked for more
I should have asked for more
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut oh-oh-out

There is no cure in someone else, someone else
My only keeper is myself, is myself

I should have asked for more
I should have asked for more
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut out for this
I should have asked for more
I should have asked for more
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut oh-oh-out
