born on a different cloud
from the ones that have burst round town,
it's no suprise to me,
that you're classless, clever, and free

loaded just like a gun
you're the hero that's still unsung
living on borrowed time
you're my son and you're gonna shine

talking to myself again
this time I think I'm getting through
it's funny how you think
it's funny how, it's funny how when you do

born on a different cloud
from the ones that have burst round town
it's no suprise to me
that you're classless, clever, and free

lonely soul, busy working overtime
nothing ever gets done, especially when your hands are tied
lonely soul, breaking up your mother's pride
nothing ever gets done, not until your war's won

we're born on a different cloud
your born on a different cloud
we're born on a different cloud
we're born on a different cloud

we're born on a different cloud
we're born on a different cloud
we're born on a different cloud
we're born on a different cloud

born on a different cloud
born on a different cloud
born on a different cloud
da da da da na na na na...
