When you take me
Or when you may...
(I'll fall for you) I'll fall for you

Time is a good mise
Of never knowing
About you (About you)

I surrender
I surrender
To you

(I surrender)
I surrender
I surrender
To you

Love isn't easy (Easy)
Easy to find (Easy)
I'll stay for you (Easy for you)

I'm trying hard, baby (Baby)
Too tired to fight (Baby)
For you (For you)

I surrender (Surrender)
I surrender (Surrender)
To you (Ooh)

(Surrender)
I surrender
I surrender
To you

(Forever)
(Ooh)
(Forever)
(To you)

My heart is in prison
The whole [?]
Come close to me

(I surrender)
I surrender
I surrender (Surrender)
To you (Ooh)

(I surrender)
I surrender
I surrender (Surrender)
To you (Ooh)

I surrender
I surrender (Surrender)
To you (Ooh)

(I surrender)
I surrender
I surrender (Surrender
To you (Ooh)
