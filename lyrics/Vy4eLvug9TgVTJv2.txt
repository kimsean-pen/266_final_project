Run and hide
It's gonna be bad tonight
'Cause here comes your devil side
It's gonna ruin me

It's almost like
Slow motion suicide
Watching your devil side
Get between you and me

So tell me what I need to do
To keep myself away from you
To keep myself from going down
All the way
Down with you

Still, I want you
But not for your devil side
Not for your haunted life
Just for you

So tell me why
I deal with your devil side
I deal with your dangerous mind
But never with you

Who's gonna save you now
Who's gonna save you

I can't lie
But I do miss those times
We were on the high
I thought it would never end
But you and I
Have come from the same long line
Good kids with a devil side
Just going around again

So tell me what I need to do
To get myself away from you
To keep myself from going down
All the way
Down with you
All the way
Down with you

I want you
But not for your devil side
Not for your haunted life
Just for you, (just for you)

So tell me why
It's always your devil side
It's always your dangerous mind
It's never you

So who's gonna save you now
Who's gonna save you

So tell me what I need to know
To make you want to change it all
To keep myself from going down
All the way
Down with you
All the way
Down with you

I want you
But not for your devil side
Not for your haunted life
Just for you

So tell me why
I deal with your devil side
I deal with your dangerous mind
But never with you

Who's gonna save you now
Who's gonna save you

Who's gonna save you now
Who's gonna save you

(Ooh, oh)
(Who's gonna save you now)
(Who's gonna save you now)
