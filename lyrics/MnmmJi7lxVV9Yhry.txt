At the beginning there was a samurai
After fighting 1000 battles and 100
wars, he was denied entrance into heaven
Wounded by solitude, he went to rest in the depths of a forest
10 times per Millenium,
he chooses a host, and accompanies him for 100 years
Retreating from his enclave to escape his extreme loneliness,
he carries on his reign and recreates a world suited to his persona:
One of war and conflict.
From generation to generation he embraces various forms and remains
unknown to mortals,
but ancient writings give evidence of
his apparitions throughout history...
The gigantic black samurai submitting his host to a life of domination

Out from nowhere, representing everybody,
this is Rise of the Northstar and the Legacy of Shi!
Motherfucker!
