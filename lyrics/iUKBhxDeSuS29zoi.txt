And here we go again!

All over again we'll catch the last plane
No we never said that we would stop now
We'll do it again breaking handcuffs and chains
You'll meet us at parties we're not even at

We couldn't come back at a better time
The wait is over
Get up and fight for another round
Now or never

And now it feels like we just can't stop anymore
Even if we tried
We're not changing the world
We're making it right
Whatever you want in this only life
Can we just be proud tonight
'Cause again we cross the starting line

There's so many things that we've never seen
So many places where we've never been
And everyone thinks that without leading light
You already failed before you even tried

We couldn't come back at a better time
The wait is over
Get up and fight for another round

'Til we die!
'Til we fuckin' die!

And now it feels like we just can't stop anymore
Even if we tried
We're not changing the world
We're making it right
Whatever you want in this only life
Can we just be proud tonight

Let me hope now
Let me start again
Take it away
Forget my name
Over again
This is how it goes
Every story's made before it's told

Let me hope now
Let me start again
Take it away
Forget my name
Over again
This is how it goes
Every story's made
Before it's told!
Before it's told!

And now it feels like we just can't stop anymore
Even if we tried
We're not changing the world
We're making it right
Whatever you want in this only life
Can we just be proud tonight
'Cause again we cross the starting line
