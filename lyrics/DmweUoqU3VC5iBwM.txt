All the holes at once are coming alive, set free
Out of sight and out of mind
The lonely and their prey

The ones you light your fires to keep away
Crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say
"Yeah"

All the birds stay up in the trees
All the fish swim down to the deep
The lonely and their prey
I am here, come to me before it's too late

The ones you light your fires to keep away
Crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say
"Yeah"
