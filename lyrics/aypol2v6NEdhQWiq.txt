They say don't trust
You, me, we, us
So we'll fall we must
Cause it's you, me
And it's all about, it's all about

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
There's a thing that they can't touch
'Cause you know (ah ah)

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
We'll run away if we must
'Cause you know (ah ah)

It's all about us (it's all about us)
It's all about us (it's all about us)
In you I can trust (it's all about us)
It's all about us

If they hurt you
They hurt me too
So we'll rise up
Won't stop
And it's all about, it's all about

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
There's a thing that they can't touch
'Cause you know (ah ah)

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
We'll run away if we must
'Cause you know (ah ah)

It's all about us (it's all about us)
It's all about us (it's all about us)
In you I can trust (it's all about us)
It's all about us

They don't know
They can't see
Who we are
Fear is the enemy
Hold on tight
Hold on to me
'Cause tonight

It's all about us
It's all about, all about us
There's a thing that they can't touch
'Cause you know (ah ah)

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
There's a thing that they can't touch
'Cause you know (ah ah)

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
We'll run away if we must
'Cause you know (ah ah)

It's all about us (it's all about us)
It's all about us (it's all about us)
In you I can trust (it's all about us)
It's all about us

It's all about us
