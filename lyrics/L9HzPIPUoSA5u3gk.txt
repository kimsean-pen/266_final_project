Refugee, silence, agony, crawling back to me
My inner hell set free
Sacrifice, acceptance at a price
Solidarity - Fuck you, I am integrity

Insurrection
Ritual aggression

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Ritual

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Ritual

Culminate while we instigate
See my scars of hate, this is the new dark age
Build upon a war that can't be won
Infernal agony, just set me free

Insurrection
Ritual aggression

Hey!

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

When you're facing the end
Your pilgrimage begins

Order out of chaos
Order from disorder

Hey!

Order from disorder
