My heart is weak, tear it down piece by piece
Leave me to think
Deep in my structure think I still love her, but I need some sleep
You've taken my breath away
Now I want to breathe
'Cause I cannot see what you can see, so easily

I thought my demons were almost defeated
But you took their side, and you pulled them to freedom
I kept your secrets, and I thought that you would do the same

Leave me in peace
Caught in my memories, lost underneath
Deep in my structure, I feel a rupture from where she should be
You've taken my breath from me
Now I want to breathe
'Cause I cannot see what you can see, so easily

I thought my demons were almost defeated
But you took their side, and you pulled them to freedom
They know my secrets
And won't let me go, won't let me go

I thought my demons were almost defeated
But you took their side, and you pulled them to freedom
I kept your secrets, and I thought that you would do the same

I thought my demons were almost defeated
But you took their side, and you pulled them to freedom
They know my secrets
And won't let me go, won't let me go

I thought my demons were almost defeated
But you took their side, and you pulled them to freedom
I kept your secrets, and I thought that you would do the same
