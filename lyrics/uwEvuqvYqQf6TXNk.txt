The way it goes, is the way it goes.
I'm all right to go
So go...
...you go.
They took their things and headed for the coast
Denied of all in life they needed most
Loves forgotten child
born into the wild
Come to the coast, come to the coast, come to the coast
come to the coast it will find you...
The fallout from the California glow
Toronto's frozen over this every man should know
I've forgotten now
Won't you show me how?
Come.
So run away, so run away from here.
Just run away, just run away my dear...
'Cause love's forgotten child...
So go into the wild
...Come.
Somebody took me away... something controls me...
