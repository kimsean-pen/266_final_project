you saved for a bass guitar
you knew you made a mistake when you first saw a mark
with your pen and notebook, you blow me away
its the smallest words we cannot say

your favourite colour is that of red wine
which brings me round to your favourite pastime
with your pen and notebook, you blow me away
and i wont be blamed for not feeling the same

are the stars out tonight?
from the sunset, oh the prettiest sight
will you stumble, fall, tonight?
are you watching, wrapped up cosy and tight
