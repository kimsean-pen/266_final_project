I was born to fly away and run across the sun
It faded out like a candle in the breeze
Fading out like I'm supposed to
So everyday I'm against the wall with nowhere to turn to
And if I dare to believe it all it leaves me deflated

When my mind begins to stray and my thoughts begin to run
I've played it out
I can't seem to find the peace I've heard about
Am I not supposed to?
So everyday I could lose it all, don't let this concern you
So will you catch me if I fall and keep me elated?

It's not complicated

And if I knew I could change it all I'd hope that you waited
(Can't be broken down)
And if I knew I could change it all I'd hope that you waited
(Can't be broken down)
(Can't be broken down)
(Can't be broken down)
(Can't be broken down)
(Can't be broken down)
