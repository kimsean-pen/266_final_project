No ones going to love you like I do
I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all of the pain
I can't stop drinking about you

Without you I ain't the same
I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all of the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same
You would believe

You could never see
My potential in everything I saw in me
Why couldn't you be the girl just for me
But instead you she was fucking with multiple thieves

You never gave me a reason on why you cheated
You left me so heated
You never saleeted
You watched it like you were an over achievement
And mow were repeating the play
Laid in my bed when I feel alone

And you're crossing my head
You ripped me apart

Now a part of me's dead

I still think it's just
I wish that I said

Did I digress
and let it digest

Continue to keep everything repressed
And let it compress until I'm depressed
And I snap on a track and put in a rapper
The things I confess and I swear
You had had it set
You ran right so I got up and left
You poured the poison
And I swallowed regret
I couldn't expect it from you
When you lacked self-respect
And just know I really hated
You set it up
And I simply disabled it
REST COMING SOON
