You've got your back turned
You cut yourself down

Am I the cancer
That makes you grind your teeth at night
I've been watching you do it
For the laft few years now

Afraid of your own mind
It's natural instinct
But your power is inside
Afriad of your own mind
You never feel complete
But you haven't even tried

You've got your back turned
You cut yourself down
I've been watiching you do it
For the past few years now

It only matters
If you're sad when you're alone at night
But you haven't even tried to lay your head by itself
It doesn't look right

Afraid of your own mind
It's natural instinct
But your power is inside
Afriad of your own mind
You never feel complete
But you haven't even tried

Afraid of your own mind
It's natural instinct
But your power is inside
Afriad of your own mind
You never feel complete
But you haven't even tried

Afraid of your own mind
It's natural instinct
But your power is inside
Afriad of your own mind
You never feel complete
But you haven't even tried

You've got your back turned
You cut yourself down
I've been watching you do it
For the past few years now
