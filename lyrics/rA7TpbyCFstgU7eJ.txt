The boy had a way with words, he sang, he moved with grace
he entertained so naturally, no gesture out of place
his road in life was clearly ddrawn, he didn't hesistate
he played, they saw, he conquered as the master of his fate.
The girl had an iron soul no-one could recognise
material ambition that her gentleness disguised
she gave herself to him certain of his fame
wanted him for luxury, for limelight and his name.
And then he sang to her
I love you for your silence
i love you for your peace
the still and calm releases
that sweep into my soul
that slowly take control
I love you for your passion
i love you for your fire
the violent desire
that burns me in its flame
a love i dare not name
His rise was irresistable - he grew into the part
his explanation simply that he suffered for his art
no base considerations of some glittering reward
the prize was knowing that his work was noticed and adored
I love you for your silence
i love you for your peace
the still and calm releases
that sweep into my soul
that slowly take control
Yes he told the truth
Accepting every honour with a masterly display
of well rehearsed reluctance to be singled out this way
he started to believe that he was all they said and more
while she forgot - she forgot the reasons she had wanted him before
I love you for your passion
i love you for your fire
the violent desire
that burns me in its flame
a love i dare not name
The still and calm releases
that sweep into my soul
that slowly take control
And when at last they fell apart she wished that she could be
the hardened heart of yesterday, as cynical as he.
by changing for the better, she had changed things for the worse.
the words that made them happy once now echoed ... echoed as a curse
