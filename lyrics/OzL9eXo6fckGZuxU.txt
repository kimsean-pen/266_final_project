i found a used organizer with a picture of a cylon inside
the model looked like her
airbus 380 with a broken tv, and an uninviting seat pocket
took off and i saw the skyline, and the arch reminded me

oh, don't think of her swimming sideways
don't think of her kicking at the topsoil
don't think of her fists in the face mask
don't think of her
never think of her

don't think of her study for the lsats
don't think of her accessing her comsat
don't think of her cursing at commuters
don't think of her
please never think of her

you took a year or two off to decode what the camera pulled in
'cause the usb port fried
punching 'til your hands tire
jerking at the firewire
narcissistic film watcher
i got knocked down

don't think of her family's confusion
don't think of her taser in the ruins
don't think of her running in an old t-shirt
don't think of her go get some exercise

don't think of her porous membrane
don't think of her reading on the l train
don't think of her crumble at the thought
don't think of her
always think of her
