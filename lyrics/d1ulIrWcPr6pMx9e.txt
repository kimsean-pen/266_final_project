I must've walked these streets about a million times
I thought I knew them well but maybe I was blind
'Cause everything's brand new

Thought I knew my heartbeat but it was out of time
It's like my lungs are opening for the first time
Ever since I met you

And I'm on my way now
Is this love, really love?

Is this love, really love?
I swear that I was heading down a darker road

You got through my guard when I was in safety mode
Darling, you're such a view
You're pulling down my walls like you're my only sun

But you're the one to blame, you hold the smoking gun
So take your aim and shoot
And I'm on my way now

Is this love, really love?
Is this love, really love?

I need to know, need to know
Cause I've never been this close

And is this love? Is this love?
Really love, really love?
So all these demons I'm letting go
'Cause I can see what is beautiful

It finally feels like I'm coming home
Is this love, really love?
Is this love, really love?
I need to know, need to know
Cause I've never been this close
And is this love? Is this love?
Really love, really love?
And all these demons I'm letting go
'Cause I can see what is beautiful
It finally feels like I'm coming home
