I never knew what you were trying to say
you spoke to me from outside the glass
I could never understand your words
I never knew what you were trying to say
I saw you place your hand over your heart
and I can hear the waves just outside your gate
I'm going away
and this space I leave for you
for the rest of my life
I'm going away - I can hear the waves
you spoke to me from outside the glass
I never knew what you were trying to say
I'm going away
