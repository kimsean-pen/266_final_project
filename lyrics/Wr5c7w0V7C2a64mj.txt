I found you
After the
Afterparty
Left early
It never really started
I couldn't get an arm in
I couldn't get an army
You told me
That you were sleepy from the scene
I threw my
Smoke from the balcony
But I didn't look myself
We left somewhere else
Fire In Hibernia
Rising to the overpass
No one knows what's going on
Fire In Hibernia
You found me
After ya party
Didn't look myself
Didn't quit my health?
Thrown in the garden
Thrown in the garden
Didn't look yourself
Smoke in the balcony
And somewhere else
Somewhere else
You found me
After ya party
Didn't look myself
Can't get an arm in
Didn't quit my health
Thrown in the garden
Thrown in the garden
Didn't look yourself
Smoke in the balcony and
Somewhere else
Somewhere else
Fire In Hibernia
Ooh-woah!
Cornered in the upper loft
No one knows what's going on
Ooh-woah
Fire In the Hibernia
Moving through the echelons
Ooh-woah
Pyres to another world
Preatures singingdown the hall
Ooh-woah
Quiet in Hibernia
Uh
We love you Brendan
