I've finally found my place, somewhere I feel sane
I won't wait on your approval
Now you know my name

Disembodied voices circle me
Rest is absent as I lay down to sleep
My eyes are wide and I can't help but dream
Creation bred from chaos, the static on the screen
Whispers at my back won't lead the way
Invoking vibrations true release,
find me where the passion meets the pain
Breathing life, reason for being

I've finally found my place, somewhere I feel sane
I won't wait for your opinion, I just hope you feel the same
I'll finally show my face, somewhere I feel safe
I won't wait on your approval
Now you know my name

How dare you tell me how to make my art,
what you deem is real or what comes from the heart
How dare you tell me what to think and feel,
when I've traveled through hell to eventually heal
Whispers at my back won't lead the way
I won't cower at the tides of life
Find me where the passion meets the pain
I'll hold fast take my on advice

I won't wait to ask permission to live out my life's passion
I won't abide an atrophied soul, withered from inaction
Bottled up inside, no more places to hide
I didn't realize I was biding time
