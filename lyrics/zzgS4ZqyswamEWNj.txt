Oh, yeah, yeah

Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holdin' hands, places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa, can you hear me?

I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss
I sent it off, and just said this
I know exactly what I want this year
Santa can you hear me?

I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me, someone to hold
Maybe, maybe
He'll be all my own in a big red bow

Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is here

He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year

Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep
Would I be wrong for takin' a peek
'Cause I heard that you're coming to town
Santa, can you hear me?

Yeah, I really hope that you're on your way
With something special for me in your sleigh
Oh, please make my wish come true
Santa, can you hear me?

I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me, someone to hold
Maybe, maybe
We'll be all alone under the mistletoe

Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near

He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year

I hope my letter reaches you in time, oh, yeah
Bring me love, I can call all mine, oh, yeah
'Cause I have been so good this year, oh oh
Can't be alone under the mistletoe
He's all I want in a big red bow

Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year

Oh, Santa, can you hear me?
Oh, Santa
Well, he's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year
Santa, that's my only wish this year
