I'm just your fool, can't help myself
I love you baby and no one else
Well I'm crazy, you are my baby
I'm just your fool

I'm just your fool, I must confess
Still love you baby, I take your mess
At night, no use in jiving, I'm just your fool

Must be tryna drive me crazy
For treating me the way you do
I ask you please have mercy baby,
Let me be number two

If you're gonna leave me for someone new
Go buy me a shotgun, shoot at you
But at night, no use in jiving
I'm just your fool

I'm just your fool, can't help myself
I love you baby and no one else
Well I'm crazy, you are my baby
I'm just your fool
