The fact that you
You think you can
Speak to me
The way you do
Bleeds me to believe that you
Have never stepped out of the skin you live within
But when, and if
This day occurs

Your tongue, the taste
Will immitate a battery
The anti-equilibrium
Your stomach becomes the floor

The look on your face was priceless!
The look on your face was priceless!
Yes, the look on your face was priceless!
That look, it was...
A light goes on
Upstairs, the attic is ablaze
This island isn't big enough for the both of us
So who will swim in eel infested oceans?
Kiss the sand goodbye

because the tide is coming up and in
Yeah, water, water, water everywhere!
And every chance to sink!
The look on your face was priceless!
The look on your face was priceless!

Yes, the look on your face was priceless!
That look, it was so priceless
It's an amalgamation
Of the things you aren't
The ways you wish you were
A split second

Perceiving of the way you really look to everyone of them
I wish that you could get a glimpse
I wish that you could see because
The look on your face was priceless!
The look on your face was priceless!
Yes, the look on your face was priceless!
That look, it was so priceless
