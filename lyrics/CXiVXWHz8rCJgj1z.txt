See my breath with every word
Frozen in time looking back at me
Can still be heard

Looking out from a window sill
My conscience surrounding
In everything I see

I see my breath with every word
Frozen in time looking back at me
Can still be heard

All along
I've done this on my own
I heard your voice
And now it's gone
