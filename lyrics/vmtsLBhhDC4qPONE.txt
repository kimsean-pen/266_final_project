It seems, it seems, mighty treacherous
A superstition leads me
Maybe, maybe, it's getting dangerous
I'm counting symbols, one, two, three

Something in the water, is it me that's going under?
I'm shakin'
Psychic kind of power
Now's the time and now's the hour of makin', ooh

So help me God
Where am I now?
(I'm afraid, I'm afraid, in the future crowd)
I cut my hair
I shot them down
(I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm dreaming)

Can you hear, can you hear, can you hear me howl?
(Say can you hear me?)
Can you hear, can you hear, can you hear me howl?
(Say can you hear me howl?)

I was, I was, young and untamed
Dancing like my mother
I pray, I pray, we will be safe
Though we may uncover

Something in the water, I can't help, I'm going under
Oh, save me
Psychic kind of power
It's my time and it's my hour of makin'

So help me God
Where am I now?
(I'm afraid, I'm afraid, in the future crowd)
I cut my hair
I shot them down
(I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm dreaming)

Can you hear, can you hear, can you hear me howl?
(Say can you hear me?)
Can you hear, can you hear, can you hear me howl?
(Say can you hear me howl?)

Standing in front of the hungriest crowd
Nothing will stop me from screaming out loud
I am the wolf and the enemy now
Say can you hear me? Ooh
Oooh
(No, no, no)

So help me God
Where am I now?
(I'm afraid, I'm afraid, in the future crowd)
I cut my hair
I shot them down
(I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm dreaming)

Can you hear, can you hear, can you hear me howl?
(Say can you hear me?)
Can you hear, can you hear, can you hear me howl?
(Say can you hear me howl?)

(Say can you hear me?)
(Say can you hear me howl?)
