My love is overdone, selfish and domineering
It won't sit upon a shelf
So don't try to reason with my love
My love is powerful, ruthless and unforgiving
It won't think beyond itself
So don't try to reason with my love
And when you pray, he will not answer
Although you may, your voice is on your mind
They won't be kind

My love won't reason, loosen up the chains that found you
Don't try to reason with my love!

My love is chemical, shallow and chauvinistic
It's American display, so don't try to reason with my love!
And when you pray, he will not answer
I know this 'cause I ask him all the time
To redraw my mind

My love won't reason, loosen up the chains that found you
My love won't reason, break away the walls surrounding you
My love won't reason, free you from the pain you're captive by
Don't try to reason with my love!
