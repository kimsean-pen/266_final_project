The air tastes just like you, it's the smell of June
A sensory shock that jolts my spirit, I slowly swallow you
A spray of little droplets, a fragrance so refined
The spirit of nostalgia is passing me by

Opium and poison, jasmine and rose
Dream of ambrosia, all flavours glow, it's sensual, it's sensual, it's sensual, sensual

It all began so easy, with you on the floor
Against your willing flanks and knocking down your door
Until the day it crumbled, no game of win and lose
You told me nothing, you left me confused

Expelled like poison, a trim of the dose,
A limb disposed of, in a whim she chose, so rigorous, she's vigorous
she's vigorous, she's vigorous.

Heart of the hardest world, it's just the thought of you
All those variations, the air is full of you
The smell of summer rain, once more the scent of June
This sweet concentration, brings me back to you
Opium and poison
My taste of June, my taste of you
Inhale, inhale your trail
Opium and poison, jasmine and rose, dream of escape with me, all flavours go
It's sensual, it's sensual, it's sensual, it's sensual

What was ours will drift away, a simple breeze on a humid day

Oh, nothing lasts, nothing lasts, nothing lasts, forever
