Why don't you talk to me?
I'm standin' here alone
I know you'll never phone

Why don't you talk to me?
Why don't you talk to me?
Come say it to my face
So we can leave this place
Why don't you talk to me?

What you're thinkin' I would never know
Now's the time for you to let it go
Let it be and hold you tight
Scream at me for just one night

Why don't you talk to me?
Why don't you talk to me?
Come on and dig your horns
Instead of dirty looks
Why don't you talk to me?

Stop
You've got no where to go
No blame, no shame
This ain't a peaches show
It's just me and you
It's just me and you
It's just me and you
It's just, me and you

There's no wall for you to hide behind
Stop pretendin' that the problem's mine
Lift your head and look me dead in the eye
What made you so bitter inside

Why don't you talk to me?
Why don't you talk to me?
Because I'm standin' here
I got an open ear
Why don't you talk to me?

Go, go, go
Come on
Spit it out
Rolls off your tongue
Right out your pretty mouth
You've got to say it to believe it
Got to say it to believe it
Got to say it, got to say it, say it, say it, say it

Say
Why don't you talk to me?
Why don't you talk to me?

Why don't you!
Talk to me
Talk talk to me
Talk to me
Talk talk to me (to me)
Talk to me
Talk talk to me (Why don't you talk to me?)
Talk to me
Talk talk to me
