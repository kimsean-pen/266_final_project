Day by day
Hour by hour
What haunts my nighttime
Sharts my daylight
Even good friends
Have no answers
Beautiful stars
You don't want a hard patch
Just a few facts
It's use and abuse
You'd write your story
As work for playtime
Time for love
My beautiful stars
Beautiful stars

Don't touch her man
I want her over and over again
Don't touch her man
I want her over and over again

Beautiful stars
In my daytime drama
When I ask the questions
War and answers
See you dancing
Romancing what I want
My beautiful star
Beautiful star

Don't touch her man
I want her over and over again
Don't touch her man
I want her over and over and over and over

Beautiful star
Of my daytime drama
Yes it's in my hand now
You're my hope for a future
Beautiful star
Of my daytime drama
Love to win a boy
You're my hope for a future
Some are happy and some are amazed
Some are devoted
Some are saved
I was one, but I was saved
Again, again
Beautiful star of a daytime drama
