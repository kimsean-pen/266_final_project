Always talking' around this
He wants me, I get things, everything I wanted
My own way, your time, goldmines
Loose guys, on my backless dresses, excess

I cannot help myself, I'm just doing what I do
Got my heart set, do anything that I want so thank you
I like it and I do what I like
And then you do what I like then you'll like it

If you wanna just scream your lungs out
If you wanna just cry your eyes out
I'm not doing that, that's what I'm about

You can cry your eyes out of your head
Baby, baby, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
You can cry again
My face like a mannequin
Mannequin, yeah, I did it again and again
You can cry again
My face like a mannequin

You told me you're lonely can't hear you, can't feel you
I'm frozen in pose and there's no way to move me
Watch me, dress me, can't impress me
I'm not changing, I'm just

I cannot help myself, I'm just doing what I do
Got my heart set, do anything that I want so thank you
I like it and I do what I like
And then you do what I like, then you'll like it

If you wanna just scream your lungs out
If you wanna just cry your eyes out
I'm not doing that, that's what I'm about

You can cry your eyes out of your head
Baby, baby, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
You can cry again
My face like a mannequin
Mannequin, yeah, I did it again and again
You can cry again
My face like a mannequin

My face like a mannequin
My face like a mannequin
My face like a mannequin
My face like a mannequin

Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me
Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me
Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me
Watch me, watch me, watch me

If you wanna just scream your lungs out
If you wanna just cry your eyes out
I'm not doing that, that's what I'm about

You can cry your eyes out of your head
Baby, baby, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
You can cry again
My face like a mannequin
Mannequin, yeah, I did it again and again
You can cry again
My face like a mannequin
