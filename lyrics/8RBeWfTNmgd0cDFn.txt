Shawty, what you sippin' on? Gatorade
Shawty, what you smokin' on? Lemonade
I'm up in the sky, finna elevate
Mix it with some Kool-Aid
Pop 'em pills 'cos I get paid

Ga-ga-galaxy boys, reality is far away
Liquid love got me floatin' away
Up in the club, Grey Goose everyday
Stacks on racks till my mind starts meltin' away
Smokin' that jay, posted in the bay
Sadboys sippin' Arizona day by day
Day by day, I goes away
Swervin', swervin' on this iced tea
Yung Gud shawty posted with that DMT
Hash in the pipe is ABC
Cut their wrists and lay 'em down gently
Leopard colored backseat in my Bentley
Relently I pop two pills, too many
I don't give a fuck, I brought plenty

(Champagne and lobster, it's a rich kid party)
(You know what it do Yung Leandoer, shawty)
(Rockin' Bravo, Bravo Charlie, sippin' on Bacardi)

(Woo!) Skinny bitches, they die quick
Grim reaper on my dick
Fuck her from the back, ain't that some shit?
Cum in her face, I ain't scared to die
I'm in my zone, I'm with my team
I'm sobered up, I'm spaced out
Arizona Iced-Out, yeah, I'm that guy
Neon polar bears, I drink iced tea all day
Catch me in a Hummer with your mother and Macy Gray
Million ways posted up in the Milky Way
Silky lake with a couple hundred bills to pay
Stuck in a Monday with Bill all day
Neon lights and I swerve around
