If I find in myself desires nothing in this world can satisfy
I can only conclude that I
I was not made for here
If the flesh that I fight is at best
Only light and momentary
Then of course I'll feel nude when to
Where I'm destined I'm compared

Speak to me in the light of the dawn
Mercy comes with the morning
I will sigh and with all creation groan
As I wait for hope to come for me

Am I lost or just less found?
On the straight or on the roundabout of the wrong way?
Is this a soul that stirs in me
Is it breaking free, wanting to come alive?
'Cause my comfort would prefer for me to be numb
And avoid the impending birth
Of who I was born to become

Speak to me in the light of the dawn
Mercy comes with the morning
I will sigh and with all creation groan
As I wait for hope to come for me

For we, we are not long here
Our time is but a breath, so we better breathe it
And I, I was made to live
I was made to love
I was made to know you

Hope is coming for me
Hope is coming for me
Hope is coming for me
Hope, He's coming

Speak to me in the light of the dawn
Mercy comes with the morning
I will sigh and with all creation groan
As I wait for hope to come for me
