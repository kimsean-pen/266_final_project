Have you heard the news?
Everybody's asking who
is that man you've been seen with
and why I'm never out with you

Please tell me that you love me
Sort out this confusion
Say our love is still alive
For people must be jumping
to the wrong conclusion
that one and one make five

What I need right now
is to hear you say they got it wrong
that he's just a new friend
a perfectly innocent one

So, tell me that you love me
Sort out this confusion
Say our love is still alive
For people must be jumping
to the wrong conclusion
that one and one make five
People are assuming
'cause it's so confusing
that one and one make five

If one and one make two
I don't need to worry about you
but here where gossip and rumour thrive
one and one add up to three, four or five

One and one and one and one and one make five
(One and one make five)

Let's stay in tonight
and maybe disconnect the phone
The correct arithmetic
just the two of us at home

Oh, tell me that you love me
Sort out this confusion
Say our love is still alive
For people must be jumping
to the wrong conclusion
that one and one make five

Tell me that you love me
Sort out this confusion
Say our love is still alive
For people must be jumping
to the wrong conclusion
that one and one make five

If one and one make two
I don't need to worry about you
I don't need to worry about you
