Underneath your dream lit eyes
Shades of sleep have driven you away
The moon is pale outside
And you are far from here
Breathing shifts your careless head
Untroubled by the chaos of our lives
Another day, another night
Has taken you again my dear
And you know that I'm gonna be the one
Who'll be there when you need, someone to depend upon
When tomorrow comes
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
When tomorrow comes
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
When tomorrow comes
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
When tomorrow comes
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
Last night, while you were lying in my arms
And I was wondering where you were
You know you looked just like a baby
Fast asleep in this dangerous world
Every star was shining brightly
Just like a million years before
And we were feeling very small
Underneath the universe
And you know that I'm gonna be the one
Who'll be there when you need, someone to depend upon
When tomorrow comes
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
When tomorrow comes
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
When tomorrow comes
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
When tomorrow comes
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
And you know that I'm gonna be the one
Who'll be there when you need someone to depend upon
When tomorrow comes oh yeah
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
When tomorrow comes oh
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
When tomorrow comes
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait
When tomorrow comes, oh yeah
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
I can't wait till tomorrow comes baby, oh
Baby, no no
(I wanna be with you, when tomorrow comes)
I wanna be with you, when tomorrow comes
