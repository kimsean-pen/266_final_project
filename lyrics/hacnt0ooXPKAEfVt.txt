Packing up your things again, and I thought we were past this
I don't need reminding of something I can't forget
I'm sorry to my mother, 'cause I know how much you loved her
This could've been so different, it's just too hard to move on from it yet

And I'd give up everything for a moment of your time
And I'd give up everything

No I never took my eyes off you, girl
And I wish that you could stay
I guess I'm always waiting for you
To come back and call my name
Like we both still felt the same
I'm miserable, and I don't want you to know

I still got your picture in my wallet
I want you to know I still got it
I can't seem to take it out as much as I wanna lose it now
I miss hearing you talk in your sleep
The sight of blood, it makes you weak
And the way you look at me over your phone
And your scent all through my home

And I'd give up everything for a moment of your time
And I'd give up everything

No I never took my eyes off you, girl
And I wish that you could stay
I guess I'm always waiting for you
To come back and call my name
Like we both still felt the same
I'm miserable, and I don't want you to know

I close my eyes, you're all I see
You're all I hear, you're all I need
And you don't leave like the smoke in my lungs
I can't sleep
I close my eyes, you're all I see
You're all I hear, you're all I need
And you don't leave like the smoke in my lungs

No I never took my eyes off you, girl
And I wish that you could stay
I guess I'm always waiting for you
To come back and call my name
Like we both still felt the same
I'm miserable, and I don't want you to know
