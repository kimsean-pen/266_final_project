You played the part of the one
Who was taken down by gods
All I could think about was how a guy
Like me could fight them off

And when you finally
Submitted to embarrassing capture
Out of the corner of my eye
I see my children in rapture

One night I got up and told my father
There were witches in my room
He gave me a baseball bat and said
"Here's what you do"

When you have finally
Submitted to embarrassing capture
Take out that baseball bat
And show those witches some pasture

All you guys out there
Trying to act like Al Green
All you guys out there
Trying to act like Al Green, you're all weak

'Cause when you've finally
Submitted to embarrassing capture
All you guys out there
Gonna wish you were Al Green
