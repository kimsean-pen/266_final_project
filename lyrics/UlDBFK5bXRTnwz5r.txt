A narrative waste of patches and light
We grew up in the suburbs then we cut all our ties
Now just take a look at this through Gwyllion eyes
You're wrong my friend, the road, it bends a bit to the right

A couple more miles and I know we'll arrive
The rolling hills and valleys, well they'll eat you alive
Now the peat will grab our feet to halt the incline
A little bit more lest we waste our whole lives

We got here in the dark
We took the long way down
Just to find an inn somewhere inside this ancient town
We talked, we talked about it all night
We thought, we thought we'd make it alive
We talked, we talked about it all night
We thought, we thought we'd make it alive

We talked, we talked about it all night
Just to throw the plan out at the first light
We thought, we thought we'd make it alive
Or at least we'd give it an honest try

A narrative waste of patches and light
We grew up in the suburbs then we cut all our ties
Now just take a look at this through Gwyllian eyes
You're wrong my friend, the road, it bends a bit to the right

These stones were left here at the beginning of days
And each step that was taken wore a little away
That in of itself, well it was something to say
A conversation that could last the end of the day

We got here in the dark
We took the long way down
Just to find an inn somewhere inside this ancient town

We talked, we talked about it all night
We thought, we thought we'd make it alive
We talked, we talked about it all night
We thought, we thought we'd make it alive

We talked, we talked about it all night
Just to throw the plan out at the first light
We thought, we thought we'd make it alive
Or at least we'd give it an honest try

We talked, we talked about it all night
We thought, we thought we'd make it alive
We talked, we talked about it all night
We thought, we thought we'd make it alive
We talked, we talked about it all night
We thought, we thought we'd make it alive
We talked, we talked about it all night
We thought, we thought we'd make it alive
