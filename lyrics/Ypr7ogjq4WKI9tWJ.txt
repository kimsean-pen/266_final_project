You drive my car, around the bling
It never ends, it never ends, oh yeah
Your on the bands, but I got it made
You're on the road, just stay ...yeah
All the cool cats said you must lie on

You're on the bid, but I'm still here
You're on the road, better run abroad
Better run abroad, better run abroad
You had me dancing in the sun
You got me dancing in the sun
You got me dancing in the sun
You got me dancing in the sun.
