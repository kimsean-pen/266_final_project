But thanks for your time
Then you can thank me for mine
And after that's said
Forget it.

Don't be inane
There's no one to blame
No reason why
You should stay here
And lie to me.

Don't say anymore
Just walk out the door
I'll get along fine
You'll see.

But thanks for your time
Then you can thank me for mine
And after that's said
Forget it.

If there was a word
But magic's absurd
I'd make one dream come true.

It didn't work out
But don't ever doubt
How I felt about you.

But thanks for your time
Then you can thank me for mine
And after that's said
Forget it.
