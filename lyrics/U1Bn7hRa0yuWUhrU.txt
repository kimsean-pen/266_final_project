Spoke my heart when I had the mind to
Lost my way trying to find truth
But I'm home now, home now
I'm home now

Cross my heart and I hope to make it
Over to the other side of wasted
But I'm home now, home now
I'm home now

And I'm one of those lucky ones
Who dreams out loud and it all comes
I've been roaming round the lost and found
But I'm home now, home now
I'm home now, home now

Sold the lot when I couldn't reach it
Had the faith but I couldn't keep it
But I'm home now, home now
I'm home now

And I'm one of those lucky ones
Who prays for rain and down it comes
I've been roaming round the lost and found
But I'm home now, home now
I'm home now, home now

One more mile in my shoes
One more mile in my shoes

Oh I walk so many miles
I think I'm gonna stay a while
'Cause I'm home now, home now
I'm home now, home now

Sold my soul to a new religion
When I heard my name through the distance
And I'm home now, home now
I'm home now, home now

Oh the road is taking me home
(I'm home now)
(I'm home now, home now)
Keep those lights on
I'm coming home
