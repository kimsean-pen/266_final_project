Even though I know it's wrong
It's time for us to get back home
Where have all the hours gone?
I'd hate for you to be alone
Let's play scissors, paper, stone

Now there's only us two left
We lost a few good men on the way
Started out as quiet a crowd
Let tomorrow wait another day
Let tomorrow wait another day

Didn't we all have such a good time?
Didn't we all have the greatest night
The greatest night, the greatest night?

(You don't know what you give me)
(You don't know what you give me)

Didn't we all have such a good time?
Didn't we all have the greatest night
The greatest night, the greatest life?

(You don't know what you give me)
(You don't know what you give me)

Here's the sunrise
How the time flies

Even though we know it's wrong
I know there's time for one more song
Let's play scissors, paper, stone
Let's play scissors, paper, stone
