Working from night until day,
Never once realize
You are under paid.
You fucked your life,
Your own willing,
To stay in your shitty job.
Feed on your own sweat and tears,
All day long with nothing to say,
Back home no one gives a shit
You have been deceased,
It's a matter of time
You have finished
Digging your own grave.
All this while
You are actually dead.
