In the skies above the isle Aces In Exile prevail!

From near and far they arrived, join the force
Ready to serve the Allied command
Sent into training, though they already earned their wings
They were ready to fly they were fit for the fight

Once in the air the battle begins
They've proven their worth now they fly for revenge

Fighter pilots in exile fly over foreign land
To the story be heard tell of 303rd
Fighter pilots of Poland in the battle of Britain
Guarding the skies of the isle

Even at night shadows cover the ground
And the fighting goes on from dusk till dawn
We will fall on the Reich with the claw of the eagle!
They were ready to fight, they were ready to die

Up in the air, the battle goes on
They've proven their worth, now they have their revenge

Fighter pilots in exile fly over foreign land
Tell their story again, tell of 310
Men of Czechoslovakia in the battle of Britain
Guarding the skies of the isle

Over the battlefield brave men long way from home
You are the chosen ones sent to the sky to die
Over the battlefield brave men long way from home
You are the chosen ones sent to the sky to die

(Ooo) fly - it echoes in history
Turning the tides in the heavens above

Fighter pilots in exile fly over foreign land
When the battle has been won, tell of 401
Fighter pilots of Canada in the battle of Britain
Guarding the skies of the isle
On wings of history they turn from home
To live eternally sky bound they roam
In all of history, never before
Was more owed to so few
Fighter pilots in exile!
