Skeptical relentless
He walks away from the bound
Of straightforward obedience
He refuses to abide

Question every law
We should distrust
The very principle
Of the powers that be

Some may say run away
And live to fight another day
Tireless he never hides
Willing to face his own demise

Question every law
We should distrust
The very principle
Of the powers that be

He wants to set the world on fire
And brings chaos in our lives
To upset the reigning order
And reveal all the lies

Put everything in the fight
Stand against the machine
Readiness to derail
From the path of equity
No sign of helplessness
Only sheer serenity
Power over fear
Reside in dignity

Some may say run away
And live to fight another day
Tireless he never hides
Willing to face his own demise

He wants to set the world on fire
And brings chaos in our lives
To upset the reigning order
And reveal all the lies
And reveal all the lies
