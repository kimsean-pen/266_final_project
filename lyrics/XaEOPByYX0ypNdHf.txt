('Tony, down here.)
(What the heck are you talking about, Anthony?)
(Do you believe in destiny, huh 'Tony?)
(I don't believe in destiny, Anthony. Really, I don't!)
Does that seem right?
Wade through pain to know the chosen life
O-o-o-oohhh...

Does that seem right?
Wade through pain to know the chosen life
Does that feel right? (La-la-la-la...)
Chain your brain to feed the kids and wife (Ha-ha-ha-ha...)

(Think about it sometime)
(What? What? Wh-wh-wh... what?)
(What the heck did you just say, Anthony?)

Open, open, rush inside!
Oh then, oh then, push beside!
Open, open, rush inside!
Cross your heart and hope to die!

Does that seem right?
Wade through pain to know the chosen life (Ha-ha-ha-ha...)
Does that feel right?
Chain your brain to feed the kids and wife (Ha-ha-ha-ha...)

(—ou said it.)
(Heck you! You don't know me!)
(You don't frickin' know me!)

Try to let your precious eye!
Oh then, oh then, push it by!
Try to let your precious eye
Pay to keep your folks alive!

Does that seem right?
Wade through pain to know the chosen life
Does that feel right?
Chain your brain to feed the kids and wife (Ha-ha-ha-ha...)

(I did not get an A.)
(Sorry, 'kay?)
(I'm trying to do my best as I can.)
(Just because I don't have i—)
