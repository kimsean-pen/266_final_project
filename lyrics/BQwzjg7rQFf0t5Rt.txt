Sinking to the floor
I've found another life
Waking till the color
Fading, I was rusting
Unrecognized
Moment to the others
Making a connection to the other side
Thought I found a lover
Lost until the sunshine, to my blinded eyes

Calling for another

Let go
Of your lying eyes
Your lying eyes
Let go.
Let go
Of our lying eyes
Your lying eyes
Let go.

Hanging on a someone that I recognize
Driving on the colors
Wet onto the marrow, I realized
Love ain't like the others
Falling to the floor I can wonder eyes
Thought I found a lover
Searching ever more I did more realize
Calling for another

Let go
Of your lying eyes
Your lying eyes
Let go.
Let go
Of our lying eyes
Your lying eyes
Let go
Let go
Let go

Let go
Of our lying eyes
Your lying eyes
Let go.
Let go
Of our lying eyes
Your lying eyes
Let go.
Let go
Of our lying eyes
Your lying eyes
Let go.
Let go
Of our lying eyes
Your lying eyes
Let go.
Let go
Of our lying eyes
Your lying eyes
Let go.
Let go
Of our lying eyes
Your lying eyes
Let go.
