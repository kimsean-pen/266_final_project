City buzzing in my ears like static
Took a walk to clear my thoughts
With the crowds I move through fields of traffic
And dreamed of places we are not

Can you hear me?
On a hillside looking up
Would you climb it with me?
Would you climb it?
And when I come too
Will your steps just fade away from my consciousness?
Would you climb it?

There is a rest upon the hilltop and silence
In the trembling of the leaves
And the light that danced across our eyelids
Flickers soft into a dream

Can you hear me?
On a hillside looking up
Would you climb it with me?
Would you climb it?
And when I come too
Will your steps just fade away from my consciousness?
Would you climb it?

Can you hear me?
Can you hear me calling out?
Would you climb it with me?
Would you climb it?
And when I come too
Will your steps just fade away from my consciousness?
Would you climb it?

Have I waited too long, hesitated too long?
Will I find I'm alone? Will it tear me down?
Have I waited too long, hesitated too long?
Will I wake up alone?

Can you hear me?
On a hillside looking up
Would you climb it with me?
Would you climb it?
And when I come too
Will your steps just fade away from my consciousness?
Would you climb it?

Can you hear me?
Can you hear me calling out?
Would you climb it with me?
Would you climb it?
And when I come too
Will your steps just fade away from my consciousness?
Would you climb it?

Would you climb it?
Was it only a dream?
I woke up to your voice
Was it all a dream?
(On a hillside looking up)
Would you climb with me?
Was it all a dream?
Would you climb it?
I woke up to your voice
Was it only a dream?
Would you climb it?
