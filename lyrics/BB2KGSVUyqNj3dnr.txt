I barely made it alive
I came incredibly close
Jumped in a swimming pool
It's there I saw my ghost

He said "listen up
Boy, now here's the squeeze
You'd rather die on your feet
Than live a life on your knees"

On and on it goes
Until my head explodes
On and on it goes
Until my head explodes

I think alone at night
I find it hard to sleep
Reliving memories
I'm sick of counting sheep

I have my bag and baggage
To keep me warm
I zip my coat up tight
As I walk into the storm

On and on it goes
Until my head explodes
On and on it goes
Until my head explodes
On and on it goes
Until my head explodes
On and on it goes
Until my head explodes

I ain't scared of the dark
It's where I see her the most
Questioning my thoughts
Like a talk show host

So where'd I go from here?
Now entertainment's wrong
Can't let the viewers decide
I know, I'm done
I'm done

On and on it goes
Until my head explodes
On and on it goes
Until my head explodes
On and on it goes
Until my head explodes
On and on it goes
Until my head implodes
