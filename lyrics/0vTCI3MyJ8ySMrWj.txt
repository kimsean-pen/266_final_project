I'm just like rolling a stone up
A hill in Hades
If you want to lie with me
You're going to be a liar

Hell-flavored, I've got mood poisoning
You must be something that I hate
I'm just a prison of property

Buckets full of better misery
There's not a word for what I want to do to you
There's not a word for what I want to do to you

You and me and the devil makes 3
You and me
You and me and the devil makes 3
You and me
You and me and the devil makes 3
You and me

Murdercute happyrape
Murdercute happy, happy, happyrape
Killer
Murdercute happyrape

Murdercute happy, happy, happyrape
Killer
You and me and the devil makes 3
You and me

You and me and the devil makes 3
You and me
You and me and the devil makes 3
You and me

1-2-3
1-2-3
If you get in bed someone will fall in love
You and me and the devil makes 3

There's not a word for what I want to do to you
There's not a word for what I want to do to you
There's not a word for what I want to do to you
There's not a word for what I want to do to you.
