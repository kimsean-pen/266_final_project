he's the deflated balloon wrapped round your gate
cut price to clear and past his sell by date
he'll be the fool running through the church yard screaming out its not too late
and when he does
i know that you'll wait

he's the drunk man with bad breath coming on too strong
but he's the beauty queen that strings your heart along
and he'll answer every question in your new age magazine wrong
but i know you love him strong

so i am leaving for there's nothing to believe in
i'm just grieving for a love i never knew
please don't go misreading me
i'm not saying you've been misleading me
just not needing me the way that i need you

he's the elephant in the room that never speaks
but you dream about him every two weeks
and i wouldn't know his name but you call it in your sleep
oh i know you love him deep

so run back to him like you should
i guess i always knew that you would
for he's captured your heart in a way i never could
so go on and love him good

oh i am leaving for there's nothing to believe in
i'm just grieving for a love i never knew
you're the book i can't stop reading
i'm the stray cat you've been feeding
but the tides they are receding now its true
please don't go misreading me
i'm not saying you've been misleading me
just not needing me the way that i need you
just not needing me the way that i need you
