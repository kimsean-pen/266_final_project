Can we die to live another day?

(How could we lose sight of what matters most)
(Trying to love what cannot love us back)
(All we have is not worth living for)
(If we do not know when to let go)
How could we lose sight of what matters most
Trying to love what cannot love us back
All we have is not worth living for
If we do not know when to let go

What is this life
That we cling to it so tight
Afraid that it will take from us
These fading sentiments
Can we die?

Can we die to live another day?
Can we die to live another day?
Can we die to live another day?

What is this life
That we cling to it so tight
Afraid that it will take from us
These fading sentiments?

How could we lose sight of what matters most
Trying to love what cannot love us back
All we have is not worth living for
If we do not know when to let go
How could we lose sight of what matters most
Trying to love what cannot love us back
All we have is not worth living for
If we do not know when to let go
