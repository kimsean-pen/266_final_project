So I lost my head a while ago
but you seem to done no better
we set fire in the snow
it ain't over
I'm not done

some do magic
and some do harm
i'm holding on
holding on
i'm holding on to a straw

who is the Alpha?
and what is made of cloth?
how do you say you're sorry
and there's nothing to be afraid of

is it dark already?
how light is a light?
do you laugh while screaming?
is it cold outside?

one thing i know for certain
oh i'm pretty sure
it ain't over
i'm not done

oh
who is the Alpha?
how do you say you're sorry
and there's nothing to be afraid of
pretty sure
it ain't over
i'm not done
