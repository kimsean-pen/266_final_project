Boop boop be do yeah!
The sun sets across the ocean
I'm a thousand miles from anywhere
A pocketbook and my heart
Both just got stolen
And that sun act like she don't even care
Wind blows cold when you reach the top
It feels like someone's face is stuck to the bottom of my shoe
I got a plastic jesus and a cordless telephone for every corner of my room
Everybody but you telling me what to do
Well i've been down so long
Oh it can't be longer still
And i've been down for so long
That the end must be drawing near
I looked to everybody but me
To answer my prayers
Til i saw an angel in the bathroom
Who said she saw no one worth saving anywhere
And the blind man on the corner said
"it's simple, like flipping a coin
Don't matter what side it lands on
It's someone else's dime"
Well i've been down so long
Oh it can't be longer still
And i've been down so long
That the end must be drawing near
I take a trip
I catch a train
I catch a plane
Got a ticket in my hand
And then a fat man takes my money
And like cattle we all stand
We've been down so long
Oh it can't be longer still
We've been down so long
That the end must be
I know the end must be
Oh i know the end
Must be drawing near
