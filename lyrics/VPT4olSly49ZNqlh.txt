Late at night, walking on the street, it feels weird between us
I feel like I've seen this kind of situation before
Your warm touch
Makes my heart drop to the ground

Why do I keep acting this way?
There's no hiding

It's the perfect temperature for this mood
This street, oh it's dangerous
I think love is starting

This trembling right now, we're definitely feeling the same way
Even the sound of our footsteps resemble each other
This ambiguous distance between us

Why do I keep acting this way?
There's no hiding

It's the perfect temperature for this mood
This street, oh it's dangerous
I think love is starting

On this quiet street where darkness falls
The reason I'm not afraid at all
The streetlight embraces us

We're facing each other, there's awkward silence
Even the air is sweet, we're looking at each other
This street, oh it's dangerous
I think love is starting
