Still got that same look that sets me off
'Cause there's something about you
I got these feelings to let it show
'Cause I wouldn't let you go
I shouldn't of let you go

You asked me for closure before and girl
I told you it's over, it's over, it's not over
So here we go again

It's like I'm falling in love all over again
For the first time
And I know that it feels right
I think I'm falling in love all over again
Love at first sight, do you know how I feel

To the left, left, left
On the right, right, right
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side

To the left, left, left
On the right, right, right
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side
Tonight

I know I tried to not face the truth
But no one can love me like you do
Your love is static, it pulls me
In like a song when it first begins
I Just don't want to let you end, no

You take me over and you are my controller
I told ya, I told ya, I'm ready to go again, yeah

It's like I'm falling in love all over again
For the first time
And I know that it feels right
I think I'm falling in love all over again
Love at first sight, do you know how I feel

To the left, left, left
On the right, right, right
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side

To the left, left, left
On the right, right, right
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side
Tonight

Baby there's something
That you did to hold me on
Baby there's something that just
Keeps me from moving on
The moment I see you
I know it's going to be you
I got this figured out, oh

It's like I'm falling in love all over again
For the first time
And I know that it feels right
I think I'm falling in love all over again
Love at first sight, do you know how I feel

To the left, left, left
On the right, right, right
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side

To the left, left, left
On the right, right, right
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side
Tonight

Ay, ay, ay, ay, all over again, all over again
Ay, ay, ay, ay, all over again, all over again, yeah

Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, all over again
Oooh, yeah
