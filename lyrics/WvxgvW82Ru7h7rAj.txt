What's your time machine?
Is it Springsteen or Teenage Dream?
What's your takes-you-back?
Your first falling-in-love soundtrack?

When you were looking for the words
Somebody said it first so you didn't have to
It was looking right at you

One danced you through love
One rocked you through lonely
Mixtaped your heartbreak and made you feel holy
For the hits and the misses, for the fire and rain
Close your eyes and listen
'Cause there's a song for everything, yeah
There's a song for everything

My first lighter up
Was back when Coldplay still played clubs
My first real goodbye
Damn, that second verse still makes me cry

When I was looking for the words
Somebody said it first like they knew me
They were signing right to me

One danced you through love
One rocked you through lonely
Mixtaped your heartbreak and made you feel holy
For the hits and the misses, for the fire and rain
Close your eyes and listen
'Cause there's a song for everything, yeah
There's a song for everything
There's a song for everything

What's your time machine?
Is it Springsteen or Teenage Dream?

One danced you through love
One rocked you through lonely
Mixtaped your heartbreak and made you feel holy
For the hits and the misses, for the fire and rain
Close your eyes and listen
'Cause there's a song for everything, hey
There's a song for everything, yeah

There's a song for everything
