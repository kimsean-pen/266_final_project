Once a pillar in the ground
My ceaseless gaze behind the sky
As endlessly the heavens wept
Commence, eternal flood
Hullaballoos
Sorrow, dread and fear
What did they do to me?
I was a statue
Stone-cold, iron heart
They have bewitched me
With love, hate, fear, tears agony and regret
Now I crumble, turn to sand
Eternal waters, I give in
As my peak becomes the shore
Forever drowned I am
