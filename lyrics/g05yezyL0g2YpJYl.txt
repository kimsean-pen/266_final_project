Gone now I keep my distance
But still show persistence in trying to find out how you are
It's really testing my patience watching you waste this
Life that you have of yours in a bar
And I get the feeling that you're gonna leave him
'Cause you just can't seem to get off
You're so appealing, you can get anyone that you want somehow

Patience is useless when I'm sober and you're wasted
And you don't wanna hear it so go on just leave it

Calm down, can't we get level?
Can't we be civil? We share a lot of things
And yeah I think back when it was simple
Before I had earned some, and all I ever did was sing
Been caught under pressure trying to measure
How I feel 'bout this whole thing
You're so appealing, you can get anyone that want somehow

Patience is useless when I'm sober and you're wasted
And you don't wanna hear it so go on just leave it
And I count the times that I'm driving home
And I'm talking to myself like I'm not alone
Trying to figure to out who I've been running from
Gotta figure out who I've been running from

I keep my distance now
Forcing my jaw to smile
I keep my distance now
Forcing my jaw to smile

Patience is useless when I'm sober and you're wasted
And you don't wanna hear it so go on just leave it
And I count the times that I'm driving home
And I'm talking to myself like I'm not alone
Trying to figure to out who I've been running from
Gotta figure out who I've been running from
