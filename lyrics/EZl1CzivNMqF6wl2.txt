You're an eye opener
I'm an eye closer
Split by lids now
See what's lying there behind our eyes.

I'm tired of explaining what i've seen.
Does that secret handshake include me?
And you?
Are you a part of me? i don't know...

You and i both know
Absolutely nothing.
Test the water
Without ever getting wet.
I can't talk to anyone
Who looks me right in the eye.
Flip your lid around,
See me lying there pretending to die.

I'm tired of believing what i've seen.
Does that secret handshake include me?
And you?
Are you a part of me? i don't know...

They can't help me up now
I've been there for so long.
Looking backwards up a periscope.
I've been there for so long...

Is that what it's like?
Is that what it's like?
Is that what it's like?

You're an eye opener
I'm an eye closer.
Flip my lid around,
See what's lying there behind my eye.

And i'm tired of thinking about how to see.
Does that secret handshake include me?
And you?
Are you a part of me?
