Bringin' it back up
Throwin' balls like a southpaw
Money man kick us out
I'm training you for rickshaw
Lyin' through your teeth
Lookin' out with a broke jaw
I hit ya, I hit ya
I hit you with a curveball

We're comin' out, we're comin' out swingin'
We're comin' out, we're comin' after you
We're comin' out, we're comin' out swingin'
We're comin' out, and one more thing, fuck you

Check, one, two 'bout to drive you all insane
Bulletproof, got the bullet on the brain
Still no breakdown 'cause it's all about the fame
Whoa ow!

I'll never back down, no complications
Like I'm skating
Blazing back up on the hell
I'm gonna keep raising
Pump it out of your chest
Because I'm spacing
Betcha, I betcha gonna
Think we're amazing

We're comin' out, we're comin' out swingin'
We're comin' out, we're comin' after you
We're comin' out, we're comin' out swingin'
We're comin' out, and one more thing, fuck you

Check, one, two 'bout to drive you all insane
Bulletproof, got the bullet on the brain
Still no breakdown 'cause it's all about the fame
Whoa ow!

Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

We're comin' out, we're comin' out swingin'
We're comin' out, we're comin' after you
We're comin' out, we're comin' out swingin'
We're comin' out, and one more thing, fuck you

We're comin' out, we're comin' out swingin'
We're comin' out, we're comin' after you
We're comin' out, we're comin' out swingin'
We're comin' out, and one more thing, fuck you

Check, one, two 'bout to
Drive you all insane
Bulletproof, got the bullet on the brain
Still no breakdown 'cause
It's all about the fame
Whoa

Check, one, two 'bout to
Drive you all insane
Bulletproof, got the bullet on the brain
Still no breakdown 'cause
It's all about the fame
Whoa ow!
