The world (the world)
Is on fire tonight (tonight)
And this flame that glows (flame that glows)
Is too hot for me to fight (to fight)
Dancing flames (dancing flames)
Twisting, turning out of sight (turning out of sight)
Smoke-filled eyes (smoke-filled eyes)
Crying, "Hold me, hold me tight" (me tight)

Tears of joy
And sad, smiling faces
Oh, make the sparkle above the brightly night

The world (the world)
Is on fire tonight (tonight)
And the flame that flows (flame that flows)
Is too hot to grow so bright (so bright)
Blazing arms (blazing arms)
With a heavy appetite (appetite)
The swirling flames (swirling flames)
Blinding everyone in sight (in sight)

Sweat-filled traces
In common places
The price we pay to hear this type of fight

Fire
Fire
Fire
We're on fire tonight
