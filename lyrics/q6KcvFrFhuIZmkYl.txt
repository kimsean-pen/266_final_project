The wars are moving north
To our isles of green
Through countries washed out
By storms of steel
But they shall not pass - we shall not yield
For freedom is a love not proved
In the letting go

For all they ever allow us to be
Is an alibi, a breath mint for greed
Thus we live gravely, thus we die slowly
Thus we hide in self-control

We who came out here
To give an empire to this loneliness
That surrounds and enslaves
Defines and degrades us
Say we're mad with hope, say it's all but smoke
Say we're all gonna perish in the snows

Take this vow with me
To stay close, to be near
To be oh so sincere
Take this vow with me
For you must know
There's nothing left around here

And so you toss a coin at every turn
To know what bridge to cross
What bridge to burn
Along the towers, on the riverbanks of France
With spain still in our hearts

While we're wondering why we are all
So quick to seperate
Sex and love but not church and state
And why they have made
All of us slaves to gold and to debt
To fears and regrets

Take this vow with me
To stay close, to be near
To be oh so sincere
Take this vow with me
For you must know
There's nothing left around here

For we were not born to live their lie
In houses built to keep the tv dry
So to make you see, to make us heard
We'll have to rebuild our islands word by word

Take this vow with me
To stay close, to be near
To be oh so sincere
Take this vow with me
For you of all people must know
There's nothing left around here
