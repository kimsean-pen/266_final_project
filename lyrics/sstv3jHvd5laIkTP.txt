You got a pretty face
I got this broken heart
Just started lovers, we were destined to be torn apart
You said you needed space
I got a couple scars
Guess you're the reason for the tears
I left them where you are
I never wanted to hold you
I never wanted to hold you down
Maybe another place
Maybe another time
Tell them to say goodbye
I'll see you in another life
It always feels like we're out here alone
We're searching for new life but how could we know
And when the night time's calling and the rain starts falling
Will you still remember my name
And when you're out 'till morning and the drinks keep pouring
Do you think you'll feel the same
I need to know
I need to know
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?
You are my universe
I was your falling star
There where no world
Those thing we knew it from the very start
You said you wanted love
The kind that made you real
I gave you everything that anyone could ever feel
It always feels like we're out here alone
We're searching for new life but how could we know
And when the night time's calling and the rain starts falling
Will you still remember my name
And when you're out 'till morning and the drinks keep pouring
Do you think you'll feel the same
I need to know
I need to know
Do you feel the same?
I need to know
I need to know
Do you feel the same?
Would you call my name?
Sometimes when you love someone you gotta let them go
Let them go
Will you feel the same
In the pouring rain
Will you scream my name
I need to know
And when the night time's calling and the rain starts falling
Will you still remember my name
And when you're out 'till morning and the drinks keep pouring
Do you think you'll feel the same
I need to know
I need to know
(I need to know)
I need to know
I need to know
Will you feel the same
Will you call my name
