We were raised under Grey skies
But you'll never hear us complain
Oh, and father led the examples
Of how to draw beauty from pain
So I found a thousand springtimes in her eyes
And I learned to play games in the rain

Oh, when you left us you didn't really go
I know you're watching me from my head to my toes
And I will not go without, I won't walk without you, no
And truth be told, everybody knows
You put the food on my plate and you gave me my clothes
And I will not go without, I won't walk without you, no

I find the touch of your hand in the breeze
And the light of your smile in sun rays
You should know I hear the sound of your voice in music
So I speak with you every day

Oh, when you left us you didn't really go
I know you're watching me from my head to my toes
And I will not go without, I won't walk without you, no
And truth be told, everybody knows
You put the food on my plate and you gave me my clothes
And I will not go without, I won't walk without you, no, oh oh

We have overcome 'cause of what you've done
And it's plain to see that you're here with me
We have overcome 'cause of what you've done
And it's plain to see that you're here with me, oh, no

When you left us you didn't really go
I know you're watching me from my head to my toes
And I will not go without, I won't walk without you, no
And truth be told, everybody knows
You put the food on my plate and you gave me my clothes
And I will not go without, I won't walk without you, no
When you left us you didn't really go
I know you're watching me from my head to my toes
And I will not go without, I won't walk without you, no
And truth be told, everybody knows
You put the food on my plate and you gave me my clothes
And I will not go, I won't walk (oh no, oh no)
