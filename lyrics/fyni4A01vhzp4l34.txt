I'm on the backside
of the moon
Still hoping someday
it will bloom
Here
Don't try to count them
Cause you can't know
How many days
that I have spent cold

It don't ever matter if
I'm an illusionist
Talk
He doesn't talk

And look the lies in here
If I make them disappear
Talk
Will he then talk?

Black water radar
doesn't show
Happy is a longer way to go
Still
I never told you
cause I can't stall
For every star
there is a black hole

It don't ever matter if
I'm an illusionist
Talk

He doesn't talk
And look at the lies in here
If I make them disappear
Talk
Will he then talk?

Cautious hymn
Don't mind him
It's just my strain
Talking

Illusion
