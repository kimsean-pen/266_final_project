Everyone's too scared to open their eyes up
But everyone's too scared to close them
Everyone's frightened
They don't know what's coming
But everyone's frightened of knowing

Everyone's reading the rules of engagement
And everyone's starting to doubt them
Everyone's reaching to put on a seatbelt
But this kind of ride comes without them

I want you to think of me sitting and singing beside you
I wish we could meet all the people behind us in line
The climb to the crest is less frightening
With someone to clutch you
But isn't it nice when we're all afraid at the same time?

And it's just a ride
It's just a ride
And you've got the choice to get off any time that you like
It's just a ride
It's just a ride
The alternative's nothingness,
Might as well give it a try

Everyone's terrified that they'll be justified
Everyone's placing their bets just in case
The whole thing's a profound disappointment
Everyone's trying to stay on the side
Where the water's just boiling more slowly
Frogs in a pot, well that's one thing I've got
At least some of the frogs in here know me

I want you to think of me sitting and singing beside you
The chain pulls us up and we know that we're all gonna dive
The blur and the noise of the screaming can blind and distract you
But isn't it nice when we all can scream at the same time?

And it's just a ride
It's just a ride
And you've got the choice to get off any time that you like
It's just a ride
It's just a ride
The alternative's nothingness, might as well give it a try

And as we all go down
And as we all go round
And as we pitch from side to side
Everything is gonna be all right

Everyone's getting real scared to come out
Because coming out's going down badly
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
And I just want someone to hold me

Some are too scared to let go of their children,
And some are too scared now to have them
Suicide, homicide, genocide, man
That's a fuck ton of sides you can choose from

I want you to think of me sitting and singing beside you
I wish we could meet all the people who got left behind
The ride is so loud it can make you think no one is listening
But isn't it nice when we all can cry at the same time?

And it's just a ride
It's just a ride
And you've got the choice to get off any time that you like
It's just a ride
It's just a ride
The alternative's nothingness, might as well give it a try

And as we all go down
And as we all go round
And as we switch from side to side
Everything is gonna be just fine
Everyone you love is gonna die

That it's just a ride
It's just a ride
From the sister you miss
To the father you don't wanna write
It's just a ride

It's just a ride
From the lover you left
To the one that you're frightened to find
It's just a ride
It's just a ride
From the baby you lost
To the one that you're growing inside
Come on out darling
And don't you cry
It's just a ride
