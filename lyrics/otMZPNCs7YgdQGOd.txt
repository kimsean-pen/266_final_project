Time is against us
Circumstance likes to dick around
But there's a solution so simple
It's not all about who, who

I don't wanna have to go, go on without you, but I have to
When I go, oh, will there be anything
To go home to, go home to

I don't wanna have to go, go, go, go on
Without you, without you
I made this with you
Buckle down
You got to start your career now
The one you worked so hard for
Our way is blacked out
Fate like dumping another torch

I don't wanna have to go, go on without you, but I have to
When I go, oh, with there be anything
To go home to, go home to
I don't wanna have to go, go, go, go on
Without you, without you
I made this with you
I made this with you

I don't wanna have to go, go, go, go on without you, but I have to
When I go, oh, will there be anything
To go home to, go home to
I don't wanna have to go, go, go, go on
Without you, without you
I made this with you
I made this with you
