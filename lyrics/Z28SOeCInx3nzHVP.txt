Pull the curtain, begin, paranoia's wearing thin now
It's wearing thin now
(Where'd I go wrong?)
Close my eyes, realize I've become the victimized now
Desensitized now
The one and only day has come

I'll pay for all the bad things I've done

(Where'd I go wrong?)
Something's wrong because I find the glamour in the dark side
In the dark side
(Where'd I go wrong?)
Cheap regrets, can't forget falling victim to the debts
Still unpaid in my mind

The one and only day has come

I'll pay for all the bad things I've done
It's gonna take me, you don't know tragedy
I've been to hell and back again to tell it
Close my eyes and lay me down to sleep
I fear the worst, my beating heart ticks to explode

And my time is up so why can't I just sleep?!

Living dead awake, the horror show begins

So pull the curtains over me
(Bring on the panic, the uncontrolling manic)
It's a free-for-all, kill them all

Every last one of them, I don't care
(Bring on the panic, the uncontrolling manic)
It's a free-for-all, kill them all
Every last one of you, I don't care
Suffocate the dreams in my mind
(I can't stop believing)
Drown the thoughts that have me confined
(Stop this heart from bleeding)

Gutter dreams as black as the night
()
No one told me empathy's a lie
(Lost in paranoia)
Suffocate the dreams in my mind
(My last words I'm choking)
(Are all my dreams broken?)
Drown the thoughts that have me confined

(The silence is deafening)
(My ears won't stop ringing)
Gutter dreams as black as the night
(My last words I'm choking)
(Are all my dreams broken?)
No one told me empathy's a lie
(The silence is deafening)
(My ears won't stop ringing)
Now we're gone, do you still feel the same?
Well now, can't you see I need help to stop me from myself?
Well, can't you help me now?
