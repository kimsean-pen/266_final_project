A pirate with a tune on a holiday
A lazy Mr. Moon on a getaway
And isn't that a mood for a milky way
A Ukelele lady layin' around the Lei

Rock, rock, roll
Yea
Rock, rock, roll
Plymouth rock
Roll over
For a holiday
Went around the Lei

Abash and forth, a starboard course
With north abeam, Sherry of course
The men will share some sport and now me hearty
Not the rum of Carib' scum
It's port tonight, drink up and come
Unweigh the anchor yank and we will party

A shanty town, a shanty in Waikiki
And juxtapose a man with a mystery
A blue Hawaiian captures his melody
Pauahi O Kalani is what he sings to me

Rock, rock, roll
Yea
Rock, rock, roll
Plymouth rock
Roll over
For a holiday

Long, long ago
Long ago

Whisperin' wind sent my wind chimes a tinklin'
(Tinklin', sent my tinklin')
Whisperin' wind sent my wind chimes a tinklin'
(Tinklin', sent my tinklin')
Whisperin' wind sent my wind chimes a tinklin'
(Tinklin', sent my tinklin')
