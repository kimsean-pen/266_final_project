So this is war
We are the wasted
We can't ignore
We gotta face it
After all is said and after all is done
We're staring down the barrel of a gun

Just because we're wrong
It don't make you right
They always lie through their teeth
With no end in sight
We're the vagrants, movers, and the shakers
We're locked and loaded
So shake your money maker

We're not alright
We're not alright
Collision course set
Got the world in our sights
We're not alright
We're not alright
Final destination
Gonna make it tonight
We're falling down
We're falling
We're not alright
We're not alright
All the lost souls of the world unite

Still in the fight
We are the warriors
We can survive
We are the soldiers
Ignored the warning signs
We're paying for the crimes
It's a war and we are on the frontlines

Just because we're wrong
It don't make you right
They always lie through their teeth
With no end in sight
We're the vagrants, movers, and the shakers
We're locked and loaded
So shake your money maker

We're not alright
We're not alright
Collision course set
Got the world in our sights
We're not alright
We're not alright
Final destination
Gonna make it tonight
We're falling down
We're falling
We're not alright
We're not alright
All the lost souls of the world unite

We're falling at the speed of light
We are not alright
We're falling at the speed of light
Yeah we are not all

We're not alright
We're not alright
Collision course set
Got the world in our sights
We're not alright
We're not alright
Final destination
Gonna make it tonight
We're falling down
We're falling
We're not alright
We're not alright
All the lost souls of the world unite

We're not alright
We're not alright
We're not alright
Yeah all the lost souls
We're not alright
We're not alright
We're not alright
Yeah all the lost souls unite
