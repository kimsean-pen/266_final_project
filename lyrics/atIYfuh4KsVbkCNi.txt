We came to battle baby
We came to win the war

We won't surrender till we
Get what we're lookin for

We're blowing out our speakers
There goes the neighbourhood
A little scissor happy
A little misunderstood
We can turn you on
Or we will turn on you
Daughters of darkness
Sisters insane
A little evil

Goes a long, long way
We stand together
No, we're not afraid
We'll live forever
Daughters of darkness

Daughters of darkness
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Daughters of darkness

Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na

We're all survivors, somehow
We just broke out the pack
And I don't need no dogtag
My name is on my back
We can turn you on
Or we can turn on you
Daughters of darkness
Sisters insane
A little evil

Goes a long, long way
We stand together
No we're not afraid
We'll live forever
Daughters of darkness

Daughters of darkness
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Daughters of darkness
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Never down
Never out

Playing hard
Living loud

Keeping up
With the boys
Making out
Making noise
And you better get me home
Before the sun comes up up up
Daughters of darkness
Sisters insane
A little evil

Goes a long, long way
We stand together
No we're not afraid
We'll live forever
Daughters of darkness
Daughters of darkness
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Daughters of darkness
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
We're the daughters of darkness
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Daughters of darkness
