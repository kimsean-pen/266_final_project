If I were only, if I were only here
I'd die
I'd try to give you
Paper birds I made
But every one did fly
Never to return again

White offerings are all I bring
Welcome to white room, white room
White offerings are all I bring
I welcome you, I offer you this white room

If I were only, if I were only here
I'd try
I'd try to gift you
Paper birds I bring
And you set fire to my sky
All that I will offer you

White offerings are all I bring
Welcome to white room, white room
White offerings are all I bring
I welcome you, I offer you this white room

I can feel your color changing
I can feel your color changing
I can feel your color changing
I can feel it change, ah!

White offerings are all I bring
Welcome to white room, white room
White offerings are all I bring
I welcome you, I offer you this white room

White, white room
White room
White offerings are all I bring
I offer you this white room
