Ha, whistle me over the knell
And talk me to the sea
Can't be forever in your summer land
Feeling like geometry
Takes me over, takes me underground
Leaves me writhing in the reeds
Hiding somewhere in the choir
I won't let you, I won't let you

Sing my name again, love
Sing my name again, love
Sing my name again
Love is not love
When it's a coat hanger
A borrowed line or passenger
Ah
Fix a lid on southern dreams
So disintegrating melodies
Told the sciences between
Keep me dancing in your wet yards
Where no eyes could ever reach
Call me over for the chorus
I won't let you, I won't let you

Sing my name again, love
Sing my name again, love
Sing my name again
Love is not love
When it's a coat hanger
Borrowed line or passenger

And the bars go
And it keeps me high
But I don't know how to love you
And I held your hair
Like the coat is mine
But I don't know how to love you
And I made the air
Move in arrows
But I don't know how to love you
And your bread is warm
And it fills my nights
But I don't know how to love you right
