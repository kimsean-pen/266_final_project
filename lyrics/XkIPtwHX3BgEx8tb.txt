Patiently I was waiting
Just waiting for this day to come
To say how much I hated
Those days hating everyone

But I made it out alive
I'm here to say
I breathe at least I try
I won't go without a fight
You can't stop me

I feel like I died
And went to heaven
I think I could fly
I'll take you with me

Blatantly I resisted
The change I knew I had to make
But the fire still existed
I learn from each my mistakes

But I made it out alive
I'm here to say
I breathe at least I try
I won't go without a fight
You can't stop me

I feel like I died
And went to heaven
I think I could fly
I'll take you with me

I feel like I died
And went to heaven
I think I could fly
I'll take you with me
I'll take you with me
I'll take you with me
