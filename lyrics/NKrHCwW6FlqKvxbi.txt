It's undeniable
That we should be together
It's unbelievable
How I used to say, that I'd fall never
The basis is need to know
If you don't know just how I feel
Then let me show you now that I'm, for real
If all things in time, time will reveal
(Yeah, yeah)

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, It's plain to see
That you're the only one for me, and

Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one
(Yeah, yeah)

It's so incredible
The way things work themselves out
And all emotional
Once you know what it's all about (hey)

And undesirable
For us to be apart
Never would've made it very far
'Cause you know, you've got the keys to my heart, 'cause

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, It's plain to see
That you're the only one for me, and

Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one

Say farewell to the dark of night
I see the comin' of the sun
I feel like a little child, whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life
Into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the lifeline
Just in the nick of time

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, It's plain to see
That you're the only one for me, and

Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one
