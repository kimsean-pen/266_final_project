I was a little too tall could've used a few pounds
Tight pants points hardly renowned
She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own sitting way up high

Way up firm and high

Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues

Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves

In the summertime
Mhmm
In the sweet summertime

We weren't in love, oh no far from it
We weren't searchin' for some pie in the sky or summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Livin' by the sword

And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, to the alley, or the trusty woods
I used her, she used me, but neither one cared
We were gettin' our share

Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
Mhmm

And it was summertime
Mhmm
Sweet summertime, summertime

And oh, I wonder
I felt the lightning yeah
And I waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started hummin' a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves

When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closin' in

Mhmm
Night moves
Mhmm

(Night moves) Night moves
(Night moves) Yeah
(Night moves) Remember
(Night moves) I sure remember the night moves

(Night moves) Ain't it funny how you remember?
(Night moves) Funny how you remember
(Night moves) And I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember
(Night moves) Oh, oh, whoa

(Night moves) And we were workin'
Workin' and practicin' (Night moves)
Workin' and practicin'
(Night moves) All of the night moves
Night moves (Night moves)

Oh (Night moves) I remember
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Night moves) I remember
Ooh (Night moves) I remember
Lord I remember, Lord I remember (Night moves)

Oh
Ooh, ooh
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I remember, I remember
