After all, our dreams went down
Sinking for our very eyes
Still echoing the sound
Oh, the frozen dreadful cries

Witnessed the passing of our only loves
Lose a barrel to the sea
Why did you choose my only love?
It could have easily been me

But it seems there was some other plan
One I don't care to understand
In the refuge of these foreign arms
I could find your holy land

How can it be that we defy this tragedy
From this lifeboat in the dark?
Is it wrong that we could come together?
Wind and sorrow bear a spark

In our soul and desperation
Truest thing we'd ever known
But to admit that to love would be blasphemy
Just to show we had our ground

How can it be that we defy this tragedy
From this lifeboat in the dark?
Is it wrong that we could come together?
Wind and sorrow bear a spark

How can it be that we defy this tragedy
From this lifeboat in the dark?
Is it wrong that we could come together?
Wind and sorrow bear a spark

How can it be that we defy this tragedy
From this lifeboat in the dark?
Is it wrong that we could come together?
Wind and sorrow bear a spark
