Falling... Fall through the stargate within
but is this the first or the last time again?
Opening between the gates on either side
Spiraling... Awaken in another mind

Fall... Through nothingness...

Suffocating...
The glass freezes inside your veins
Die... Release your flesh to the astral plane
The violent plain of suffering
Your blood has vitrified
Boiling the pulp beneath
Liquefy your mind

Fear the pain...
Fire awaits...
