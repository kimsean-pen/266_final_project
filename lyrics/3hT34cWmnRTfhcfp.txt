Blue Moon
You Saw Me Standing Alone
Without A Dream In My Heart
Without A Love Of My Own

Blue Moon
You Knew Just What I Was There For
You Heard Me Saying A Prayer For
Someone I Really Could Care For

Without A Love Of My Own

Blue Moon
You Saw Me Standing Alone
Without A Dream In My Heart
Without A Love Of My Own

Without A Love Of My Own
