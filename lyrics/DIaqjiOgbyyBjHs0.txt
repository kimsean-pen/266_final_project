Young machines
Machines they burn the war
Bring on the Young my God
Bring on the babe my Lord
Bring on the Young
Bring on the dumb

The machines, machines that burns for war
Bring on the pain my God
Bring on the burn
Bring on the Young
Bring on the dumb

The machines, machines they pay for war
Bring on the hate my God
Bring on the burn
Bring on the Young

Bring on the...
HATE... HATE... HATE

Burn... BOIL... BOIL

Burn
Burn
Burn
BURN
