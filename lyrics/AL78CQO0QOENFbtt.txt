Upon a darkened night the flame of love was burning in my breast
And by a lantern bright I fled my house while all in quiet rest
Shrouded by the night and by the secret stair I quickly fled
The veil concealed my eyes while all within lay quiet as the dead

Oh night, thou was my guide
Oh night, more loving than the rising sun
Oh night, that joined the lover to the beloved one
Transforming each of them into the other

Upon that misty night in secrecy, beyond such mortal sight
Without a guide or light than that which burned so deeply in my heart
That fire t'was led me on and shone more bright than of the midday sun
To where he waited still it was a place where no one else could come

Oh night, thou was my guide
Oh night, more loving than the rising sun
Oh night, that joined the lover to the beloved one
Transforming each of them into the other

Within my pounding heart, which kept itself entirely for him
He fell into his sleep beneath the cedars all my love I gave
From o'er the fortress walls the wind would his hair against his brow
And with its smoothest hand caressed my every sense it would allow

Oh night, thou was my guide
Oh night, more loving than the rising sun
Oh night, that joined the lover to the beloved one
Transforming each of them into the other

I lost myself to him and laid my face upon my lover's breast
And care and grief grew dim as in the morning's mist became the light
There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair
There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair
There they dimmed amongst the lilies fair
