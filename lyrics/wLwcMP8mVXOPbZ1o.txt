All my life I wanted everything
I won't settle and I won't think twice about anything
Time will tell who's right about everything
Who cares what you think is mine?
I wanted everything

She could dream up a life with everything
(Everything, everything)
A man in Greece, a girlfriend in Italy
It's everything
(Nothing or everything)
The palm reader said she'd have three
That's everything
(Everything, everything)
Be a film star and keep her integrity
It's anything
(Nothing or everything)

She was nothing for you
And everything too
She'd take to the streets and stay at home
It's true, so true

Who's got everything
And something to say?
I want everything to go my way

A house, a chair and a rug
That's everything
(Everything, everything)
I mean two houses, please
I wanted everything
(Nothing or everything)
A life that's quiet and nice
I wanted everything
(Everything, everything)
But I'm going away anytime I like
I wanted everything
(Nothing or everything)

She was nothing for you
And everything too
She'd take to the streets and stay at home
It's true, so true
