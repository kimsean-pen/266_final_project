Fill my heart, O, Mr. Centipede
It's a shorthand for more, such spacious wonder
I've been collecting the weight of birds
I can't take this anymore, anymore
I can't take this anymore

I'm a saint yeah, I feel alright
I'm a saint yeah, I feel alright
Locked in a basement, do you feel alright?
Locked in a basement, do you feel alright?

And my heart is the centrepiece
Are we programmed for more or am I left to ponder how I've been collecting the weights of birds?

I can't take this anymore
You must be done, living life up on the shelf
I want to take you off the map, please let me take you somewhere else
You must be done, living life up on the shelf
I want to take you off the map, please let me take you somewhere else

I'm a saint yeah, I feel alright
I'm a saint yeah, I feel alright
Locked in a basement, do you feel alright?
Locked in a basement, do you feel alright?
