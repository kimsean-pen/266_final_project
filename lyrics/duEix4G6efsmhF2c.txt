I will graciously accept that my life's work,
whether it be in the past, the present,
or the future will be overshadowed
by those around me with a different definition of "success."

Though I can't explain the path I've chosen,
all I know is I'm right where I need to be.
And though I've turned down a chance at fame and fortune,
I know that there is no greater payment than this.

And I'm so fucking far from the life I'm supposed to lead,
and the man I'm supposed to be and I couldn't be happier.
And I will remain a constant,
I know where I stand,
and I refuse to let their selfishness take control of who I am.
While I may die poor, at least my life had meaning,
there's more to life than living, and I truly feel alive.

And I know that when I die,
there will be others who feel the same way ready to take my place.
This is our song of protest.
I promise you that nothing is slowing us down.
While I may die poor, at least my life had meaning,
there's more to life than living and I truly feel alive.

And I know that when I die,
there will be others who feel the same way ready to take my place.
I will laugh in the face of those who tell me different.
Even with both of my feet planted firmly on the ground,
I am free to move in my own direction.
I will remain a constant. I know where I stand.
