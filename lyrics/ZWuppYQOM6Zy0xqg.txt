Inhale... we take it all in
Prying hands mold... inhale
Prying hands mold
We shape you... you'll never know
Distinct cries for help rain down on our vice
The device inside
Prying hand become old
Rebirth

Inhale... we take it all in
Dying hands mold. inhale
Dying hands hold
We break you... you'll never know
Distinct cries for help rain down

Judge not what we do, judge what we feed

Mental transformation
We have become their memory

Step back and feel the sun
Step back and touch the end
We are in this together

Millions circling

Judge not what we do, judge what we feed
Guilt surrounds... we pushed for a perfect life
We held you under and let you drown

Slowly submerge... become your true self
Rain down on our vice... the device inside
Prying hands become old
Rebirth

Judge not what we do, judge what we feed

Mental transformation
We have become their memory

The moon slides past the shoreline
Its crimson glows lives on

Please don't wait up for me
I've finally locked the door
Please don't wait up for me
I can now move on

We are in this together
We are in this together

We are in this together
We are in this together

We are in this together
We are in this together

We are in this together
We are in this together
