I been lookin' to find a bigger picture
Still envision when I was chillin' with ya
I know I said I'll go my own way
But it's been months and I still don't feel a difference
Tried to focus on everyday distractions
Tried to fuck with some of the most attractive
All these alternatives just got me trippin'
At the end of the night I'm reminiscing
I'll give you any and everything that you please
Ain't that what love is, unassociated with greed
I put my heart in this shit, I hope that you see
'Cause it was simpler to stay than it was to leave (Uh)
But that was for the better, that was for me
And I been doin' better, that's guaranteed
And even though I been focused on what I need
Honestly, I gotta tell you

I ain't really trying to do nothin' but
Feel your love, feel your love, feel your love, feel your love
I ain't really trying to do nothin' but
Feel your love, feel your love, feel your love, feel your love
I ain't really trying to do nothin' but
Feel your love, feel your love, feel your love, feel your love
I ain't got the time to be frontin', I'm still in love
Still in love, still in love, still in love, still in love (Yeah, yeah)

Thoughts of trying to fix the situation
Thoughts of stayin' in place and being patient
I know time is supposed to heal everything
But staying optimistic gets complicated
'Cause I don't think I want nobody if it ain't you
To go console another body, I just can't do
I been through pain and came up out it with the same shoes
Hard to fall back when I feel you someone I can't lose
I can't move, crazy I can't choose
Act like I'm good when you see me, really that ain't true
Tellin' myself that I'm done but knowin' I ain't through
Saying it's bound to get better, something I can't prove
And I done see your true colors multiple times
Yeah, I can see through your bullshit, read through the lines
And even though I can see I'd rather be blind
'Cause deep inside

I ain't really trying to do nothin' but
Feel your love, feel your love, feel your love, feel your love
I ain't really trying to do nothin' but
Feel your love, feel your love, feel your love, feel your love
I ain't really trying to do nothin' but
Feel your love, feel your love, feel your love, feel your love
I ain't got the time to be frontin', I'm still in love
Still in love, still in love, still in love

I ain't really trying to do nothin' but feel your love (Yeah)
I ain't got the time to be frontin', I'm still in love (Uh)
Thinkin' 'bout what it coulda been and 'bout what it was (Yeah, yeah)
I been thinkin' 'bout what it coulda been and 'bout what it was
What it was, what it was, what it was, yeah
