my thoughts are running towards you now
our ritual;
don't let me drown

we have to share ups and downs
the way we used to stay without a sound
oh, I be lying
if I say nothing now

I can't get you off my closest skin
you underneath
I can't live
would you put on
left your mark on me
I can wait no more for
maybe cause you see

I got a Heart Of Gasoline
want you light it up for me?
I got a Heart Of Gasoline
want you light it up for me?
I got a Heart Of Gasoline
want you light it up for me?
I got a Heart Of Gasoline
want you light it up for me?
I got a Heart Of Gasoline

I wish I could press rewind
cause now I've got nothing to hide
oh, I know what' s wrong, what's right
whenever you around, I'm got butterfly
forget the past
just for tonight

I can't get you off my closest skin
you underneath
I can't live
would you put on
left your mark on me
I can wait no more for
maybe cause you see

I got a Heart Of Gasoline
want you light it up for me?
I got a Heart Of Gasoline
want you light it up for me?
I got a Heart Of Gasoline
want you light it up for me?
I got a Heart Of Gasoline
want you light it up for me?
I got a Heart Of Gasoline

I'm trying so hard to pretend to
I don't need you, but I need you
I'm trying so hard to pretend to
but I got a Heart Of Gasoline
want you light it up for me?

I got a Heart Of Gasoline
want you light it up for me?
I got a Heart Of Gasoline
want you light it up for me?
I got a Heart Of Gasoline
want you light it up for me?
I got a Heart Of Gasoline
want you light it up for
