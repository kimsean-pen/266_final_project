She was in the backyard
Say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pickup truck
Her folks shoulda seen it comin'
It was only just a matter of time
Plenty old enough

And you can't stop love
She stuck a note on the screen door "sorry but I got to go"
And that was all she wrote
Her mama's heart was broke
And that was all she wrote
So the story goes

Now her daddy's in the kitchen
Starin' out the window
Scratchin' and a rackin' his brains
How could 18 years just up and walk away
Our little pony-tailed girl growed up to be a woman

Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
Now don't you wonder what the
Preacher's gonna preach about Sunday morn
Nothin' quite like this has happened here before
Well he must have been a looker
Smooth talkin' son of a gun

For such a grounded girl
To just up and run
Course you can't fence time - and you can't stop love
Now all the biddy's in the beauty shop gossip goin' non-stop
Sippin' on pink lemonade
How could 18 years just up and walk away

Our little pony-tailed girl growed up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
Yahoo

She's got her pretty little bare feet hangin' out the window
And they're headin' up to Vegas tonight
How could 18 years just up and walk away
Our little pony-tailed girl growed up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
She was in the backyard
Say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pickup truck
Plenty old enough
And you can't stop love
And no you can't fence time
And you can't stop love
