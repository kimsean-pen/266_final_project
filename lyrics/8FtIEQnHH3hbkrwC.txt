We drove all night until you started to cry
Because you saw a world without you and I
Told me where your problems lie
But I can't solve 'em
Yeah, we gotta give it time
Guess that's my problem

I see you loving on the sidelines
I think about it at the wrong times
I see you loving on the sidelines
(I don't wanna know)
Who you'll be taking with you tonight

I know I drew the line
Can we erase it?
We're living in denial, but we can change this

And I drove all night until I started to cry
All because I saw a world without
You and I
Don't let this conversation die

I see you loving on the sidelines
I think about it at the wrong times
I see you loving on the sidelines
(I don't wanna know)
Who you'll be taking with you tonight

You've turned into
Someone that I never knew
I see you loving on the sidelines
I'll think about it at the wrong times
I see you loving on the sidelines
(I don't wanna know)
Who you'll be taking with you tonight

You've turned into
Someone that I never knew
You've turned into
Someone that I never knew
