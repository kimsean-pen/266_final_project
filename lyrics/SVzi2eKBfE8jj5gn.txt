You've buried me down
To hold my eyes at the lake of sorrow.
In the [...] of my eyes
Scenery of waves, of swans, ooh.

See the shadow of my obsession.
No [...] to help.
Let your [...] know the passion
I feel this lost [...] away, away.

In this life I feel lost for you,
All those times I've been praying for your love.
In your eyes I see love and innocence,
But still, I do not know:

Am I loving you?
Still I'm trying to touch.
Are you loving me?
Do you want to do?
Realize, be now and dance.
Come on, follow my words,
Then we will fly.

You've buried me down
And your life will cry.
And I crave for my love,
I long for you.

I am lost, [...]
Now I follow the light of [...]

[...]
Your flower is for withering [...]
And your love is not for me.
Why don't you tell me for who?
