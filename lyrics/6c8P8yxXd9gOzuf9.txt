Sworn to seek
The cold void of the grave
Misanthropic
High on rotting ways
Mind's destruction
Salvation is the gored
Fall into the abyss
Of mental war
Smear the soul with the blood of the old
Casket dreams ever present
Totally devoid of human ideals
Flushed out into the maelstrom of death

Internal massacre
Disposal of the self
To reach nonphysical
Wallow in dreams of human decay
Ungodly retribution
Anthropoid carcass
Regurgitated prayers
To vomit forth blasphemy

Mental abortion
Funeral of sanity

Dragged your God to death
The emptiness of prayer still lingers on your breath
