Just when everything was making sense
You took away all my self-confidence
Now all that i've been hearing must be true
I guess i'm not the only boy for you

But that's what i get
That's what i get
That's what i get
That's what i get

How can you turn me into this?
After you just taught me how to kiss you
I told you i'd never say goodbye
Now i'm slipping on the tears you made me cry

But that's what i get
That's what i get
That's what i get
That's what i get

Why's it come as a surprise
To think that i was so naive
Maybe didn't mean that much
But it meant everything to me

That's what i get
That's what i get
That's what i get
That's what i get
That's what i get
That's what i get
That's what i get
That's what i get
That's what i get
That's what i get
That's what i get
