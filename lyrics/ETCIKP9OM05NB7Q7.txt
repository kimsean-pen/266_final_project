Don't let me in, I won't let me in, I cannot stop it
I might push you into your coffin
At the funeral, laying in your coffin in my ghost white dress
Don't let me in, I won't let me in, I cannot stop it
I might push you into your coffin
At the funeral, laying in your coffin in my ghost white dress

I'm haunted, I'm haunted, I'm haunted in my ghost white dress
I'm haunted, I'm haunted, I'm haunted in my ghost white dress

So what you're waiting for?
I'm knocking on your door
On you like aquaphor, with your hands around my throat
I'm looking like a store
Our feets [?] cold
I'll keep you comfortable, with your hands around my throat

Ooh, you hold the knife, my samurai, your sacrifice
Ooh, down to the floor, a civil war, my persona

Don't let me in, I won't let me in, I cannot stop it
I might push you into your coffin
At the funeral, laying in your coffin in my ghost white dress
Don't let me in, I won't let me in, I cannot stop it
I might push you into your coffin
At the funeral, laying in your coffin in my ghost white dress

I'm haunted, I'm haunted, I'm haunted in my ghost white dress
I'm haunted, I'm haunted, I'm haunted in my ghost white dress

Tastes like a lollipop
You're like a sugar rush
I wanna break you off, with my hands around your throat
I'll miss you when you're gone, I'll leave you in the lawn
My triple hexagon, with my hands around your throat

Ooh, you hold the knife, my samurai, your sacrifice
Ooh, down to the floor, a civil war, my persona
