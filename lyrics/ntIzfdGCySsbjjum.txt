Pardon me, L-O-R-D
Why's it so hard out here for niggas like me
Pardon me, L-O-R-D
Why's it so hard out here for niggas like me

Don't test, them bullets might press
Why they wanna see me dead? I ain't even grown yet
Baby, you got too much to offer
That's prolly why they want you in a coffin
Maybe you're too young to sink it all in
Damn

Pardon me, L-O-R-D
Why's it so hard out here for niggas like me
Pardon me, L-O-R-D
Why's it so hard out here for niggas like me

I know I ain't been the easiest to deal with
As of late
Twenty-two, with a lot on my plate
But you never know when you gotta go
Sometimes I can't wait

Pardon me, L-O-R-D
Why's it so hard out here for niggas like me
Pardon me, L-O-R-D
Why's it so hard out here for niggas like me
