I remember when I found out about chemistry,
It was a long, long way from here,
I was old enough to want it,
But younger than I wanted to be,
Suddenly my mission was clear.

So for a while I conducted experiments,
And I was amazed by the things I learned,
From the fine, fine girl with nothing,
But good intentions and a bad tendency to get burned.

Oh, all about chemistry,
Won't you show me everything you know,
Ah wonder what you do to me Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh.

Some time later I met a young graduate,
When I had nobody to call my own,
I told her I was looking for somebody to appreciate,
And I just couldn't do it alone.

So for awhile we conducted experiments,
In an apartment by the River Road,
And we found out that the two things,
We put together had a bad tendency to explode.

Oh, all about chemistry,
Won't you show me everything you've learned,
I'll memorize everything you do to me so I can,
Teach it when it comes my turn.

Fine spring day, California waves,
Sweet Pacific scenes through,
The windows of aeroplanes and hotel rooms.

So when I find myself alone and unworthy,
I think about all of the things I learned,
From the fine, fine women with nothing,
But good intentions and a bad tendency to get burned.

Oh, all about chemistry,
Won't you show me everything you know,
Ah wonder what you do to me Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh.

Oh, all about chemistry,
Won't you show me everything you've learned,
I'll memorize everything you do to me,
So I can teach it when it comes my turn.

It's all about chemistry, (California waves)
It's all about chemistry, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh,
It's all about chemistry, (sweet pacific scenes)
It's all about chemistry, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh.
