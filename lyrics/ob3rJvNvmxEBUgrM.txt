Your letter's waiting home, in their bright red coats,
Under a midnight stone I hear forewords you wrote.
I can't be sad, sad, sad, sad
I can't make you mine

Now you're on your own, even they can't stand But I said before and you know
I can't take my eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes of you

And I bathed in the light you gave, but its dark in another way
Yes you gave me the light today, but its dark in another way
And I bathed in the light you gave but it's dark in another way
Yes you gave me the light today but it's dark it's dark it's dark
I can't be sad, I can't be sad, I can't be sad, I can't be sad
I can't take my eyes eyes eyes eyes
I can't take my eyes of you.
