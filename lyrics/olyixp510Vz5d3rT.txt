Talkin' sweet kinda lies
Don't you believe in him
If you do, he'll make you cry

He'll send you flowers
And paint the town with another girl

He's a sweet talkin' guy
But he's my kind of guy

Sweeter than sugar
Kisses like wine
Don't let him under your skin
'Cause you'll never win

Don't give him love today
Tomorrow he's on his way

But he's a sweet talkin' guy
But he's my kinda guy

Why do I love him like I do?

He's a sweet talkin'

Stay away from him
Stay away from him
Don't believe him he's lying

No, you'll never win
No, you'll never win
You'll just end up crying

Don't give him love today
Tomorrow he's on his way

He's a sweet talkin'
Sweet talkin'
Sweet talkin'

Sweet, sweet, sweet talkin' guy
Sweet, sweet, sweet talkin' guy
Sweet, sweet, sweet talkin' guy
Sweet, sweet, sweet talkin' guy
