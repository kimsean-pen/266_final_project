In the North, a prisoner of darkness
In black court, a victim of sleep
Slither like a snake I tried
A mole under the soil

A king, a fool trapped in a strange land
A slave of the black queen
I was under the darkest magic
Bound by an unknown spell

The one crack in the stone I need
Just the one, one fracture in the wall
Just the one hole in the sky I need
Just the one lock with the key

An otter lost in muddy waters
An elk upon strange trail
A prisoner in black court
A victim of sleep in lands of dark

One path there to be known
One sign in a dream
In time just one direction
One star in my mind

One path
One sign
One star
One lock
One key
One crack in the stone
