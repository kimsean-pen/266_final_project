Breathe in me, breathe
Breathe in me, breathe

You got me, so sick
Spinning, dizzy
You got me, so sick
Spinning, dizzy
You got me, so sick
Spinning, dizzy
You got me, so sick
Spinning, dizzy
You, you, you

Gimme more, gimme more
Gimme more, I haven't had this before
Been holding out for this one
Holding out for love
Not changing my mind so much
And still, and still

You got me, so sick
Spinning, dizzy
You got me, so sick
Spinning, dizzy
You, you

Gimme more, gimme more
Gimme more, I haven't had enough
Gimme more, gimme more
Gimme more, I haven't had this before
Been holding out for this one
Holding out for love
Not changing my mind so much

Gimme more, gimme more
I haven't had enough
