In the perfect dark, a botticellian angel exists
The elusive partner puts her key in my hand
A fairly simple gesture, shrouded in evil
As she distorts, it becomes easy to understand

Lost in her piercing eyes...
As everything around me, dies!

Well, can you make the nightmares go away?
Can you pull the demon from inside?
Will penance make the nightmares go away?
And save me from this endless night?

In the choking dark, I try to move, I'm unable
A hundred thousand moving creatures tickle my flesh
I feel the heat, it's getting harder to breathe...
I feel the panic taking hold, for I'm beginning to understand

The only way I'll be saved...
Is if someone breaks into my grave!

Well, can you make the nightmares go away?
Can you pull the demon from inside?
Will penance make the nightmares go away?
Can you save me from this endless night?

Don't need it, don't want it
No more sedation, no more sedation
Don't need it, don't want it
Eradicate this endless aching inside

Don't need it, don't want it
No more sedation, no more sedation
Don't need it, don't want it
Eradicate this endless aching inside!

Well, can you make the nightmares go away?
Can you pull the demon from inside?
Will penance make the nightmares go away?
Can you save me from this endless night?

Well, can you make the nightmares go away?
Can you pull the demon from inside?
Will penance make the nightmares go away?
Can you save me from this dreadful night?
