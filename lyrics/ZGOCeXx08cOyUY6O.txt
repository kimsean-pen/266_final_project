Lately I've been facing a fall?
Holding onto something that means nothing but war
I've been cutting connections
Causing the walls to build up around me
And faces to fade into blue blue colours
I walk in shallow waters

Should've gone my own way
But I didn't run just to hide
I ran for a better life
For a better life

You're electric
You know you light up my world when its hard to take
So lets run away
Although I know you're electric
I know that lightning won't strike twice in the same place
So lets run away

I want you to know this love
I don't regret what we've done or who we are
No need to look for protection

Should've gone my own way?
But I didn't run just to hide
I ran for a better life
For a better life

You're electric
You know you light up my world when its hard to take
So lets run away
Although I know you're electric
I know lightning won't strike twice in the same place
so lets run away

I will fly
but you're standing here fixing my broken wings
Tryin to mend
Try to mend this mess I'm in

You're electric
You know you light up my world when its hard to take
so lets run away
Although I know you're electric
I know that lightning won't strike twice in the same place
So lets run away

You're electric
You light up my world when its hard to take
so lets run away
