So she said what's the problem baby
What's the problem I don't know
Well maybe I'm in love (love)
Think about it every time I think about it
Can't stop thinking about it

How much longer will it take to cure this
Just to cure it 'cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)
Makes me wanna turn around and face me
But I don't know nothing 'bout love

Come on, come on, turn a little faster
Come on, come on, the world will follow after
Come on, come on, because everybody's after love

So I said I'm a snowball running
Running down into the spring that's coming
All this love melting under blue skies
Belting out sunlight, shimmering love

Well baby I surrender to the strawberry ice cream
Never ever end of all this love
Well I didn't mean to do it
But there's no escaping your love

These lines of lightning mean we're never alone
Never alone, no, no

Come on, come on, move a little closer
Come on, come on, I want to hear you whisper
Come on, come on, settle down inside my love

Come on, come on, jump a little higher
Come on, come on, if you feel a little lighter
Come on, come on, we were once upon a time in love

We're accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love

Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally...

I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
Accidentally

I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
Accidentally

Come on, come on, spin a little tighter
Come on, come on, and the world's a little brighter
Come on, come on, just get yourself inside her love
I'm in love
