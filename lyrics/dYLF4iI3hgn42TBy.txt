Adding up all the pain
Left in your brain
It's just another black day
Feeling alone and full of decay
Some skanky alchy'
Looking at me in an understanding way

Friends don't exist
Friends don't exist
No one's going to give you a kiss
Who cares if you exist
Friends don't exist

When you're sat at home alone
You may is well be asleep for the week
I'm so weak
But some how I exist
