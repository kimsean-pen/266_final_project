Drawn by a desolate glow...
Eerie lights from temples below...
Pale dim shades of cities lost,
Ancient idols reveal the host.

Transcending the void
Of the deepest black sea,
Consciousness fades
And life's drawn
From the flesh!

Transformation
Of lungs into gills
Metamorphosis
Of lungs into gills

Destinies intertwine in endless strife...
Pitiful dreams of evolution's crown.
Mingled in chaos to the ends of life,
Whilst gaping chasms see me drown!

Iä Iä!
Abyssal choirs resound...
Iä Iä!
Calls of worship unbound...

Body and soul in turmoil and revolt
Transformation of lungs into gills
Committed forever to the one so old!
Metamorphosis of lungs into gills
Wide awake as waters flood the breathless void...

Abyssal choirs
Resound!

Iä Iä! Calls of worship unbound...
Iä Iä! Blessed be thou who dreams!
Iä Iä! Blood and soul given to thee!

As the world trembles
In cataclysmic decay...
Seeking comfort in the
Cold caliginous deep.
Settling within murky
Green chambers of stone...
Life eternal
In the ancient
Halls of R'lyeh!
