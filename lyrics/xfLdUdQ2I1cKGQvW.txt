Absolutely I didn't want no war
Hear you stay a knocking on my door
You think you's a pioneer
Should I call your bluff from here
So dont come around pourin' gasoline
'Cause I'll light you up like a bomb through the breeze
Yeah like a bomb through the breeze
If you ask me you're a bad bad seed
You're addicted to catastrophe
Send in the chips then any o' you're guns
Send him home when I'm done
dont come around pourin' gasoline
'Cause I'll light you up like a bomb through the breeze
Yeah like a bomb through the breeze
Absolutely I didn't want no war
Absolutely I didn't want no war
Standing back just ain't enough
I got no choice but to light you up
'Cause I'll light you up like a bomb through the breeze
