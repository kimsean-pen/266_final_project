When it's cold

It come slow
It is warm
Just watch it grow
All around me
It is here

It is now!
Just a little bit of it

Can bring you up or down
Like the supper
It is cooking
In your hometown
It is chicken

It is eggs
It is in between your legs
It is walking on the moon
Leaving your cocoon
It is the jigsaw

It is purple haze
It never stays in one place
But it's not a passing phase
It is in the singles bar

In the distance of the face
It is in between the cages
It is always in a space
It is here

It is now!
Any rock can be made to roll

If you've enough of it
To pay the toll
It has no home
In words or goal
Not even in your favourite hole
It is the hope for the dope

Who rides the horse
Without a hoof
It is shaken
Not stirred
Cocktails on the roof
When you eat right through it

You see everything alive
It is inside spirit
With enough grit to survive
If you think that it's pretentious
You've been taken for a ride
Look across the mirror, sonny
Before you choose, decide
It is here
It is now!
It is Real
It is Rael
'Cause it's only
Knock and knowall
But I like it...
