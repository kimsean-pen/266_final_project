Hmm... hmm... hmm... ha
So many times said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew I'd be lying here beside you...
On my own...
On my own...
On my own...
So many promises never to be spoken

Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce and we weren't even married...
On my own... once again... now...
One more time... by... myself
No one said it was easy
No-no-no ooh no
But it once was so easy

Well I believe (I believe) in love (In love)

Now here I stand...
I wonder why
Ooh...

I'm on my own
Why did it end this way?

(on my own...)
This wasn't how it was supposed to be...
(on my own...)

I wish that we could do it all again
So many times know I could talk to
Losing you it cut like a knife

Hey
You walked out and there went my life
I don't want to live without you...
On my own...
This wasn't how it was supposed to end

On my own...
I wish that we could do it all again
On my own...
I never dreamed I'd would spend one night alone

By myself...
Oh... oh... oh... oh...
On... my own...
I've got to find where I belong again
(on my own...)
I've got to learn to be strong again
(on my own...)
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
(by myself)
By myself by myself
I... woo...
I've got to find out what was mine again
(on my own...)
My heart is saying that it's time again
(on my own...)
And I... have faith that I will shine...
By myself... again
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I... (on my own...) have faith... (on my own...) in me...
(by myself)
By myself by myself
