Me and Sam in the car, talking 'bout America
Heading to the wishing well, we've reached our last resort
I turned to him said: "Man help me out
I fear I'm on an island in an ocean full of change
Can't bring myself to dive in to an ocean full of change

Am I losing touch?
Am I losing touch now?"

He said: "Why why, what a terrible time to be alive
If you're prone to over thinking and
Why why, what a terrible time to be alive
If you're prone to second guessing"

Hey pretty smiling people, we're alright together
We're alright together
Hey pretty shining people, we're alright together
We're alright together, he-ey

Took it in turns to dream about the lottery
And what we might have done
If we had entered and had won
We're each convinced that nothing would have changed
But if this were the case
Why is it a conversation anyways?

Are we losing touch?
Are we losing touch now?

He said: "Why why, what a terrible time to be alive
If you're prone to over thinking and
Why why, what a terrible time to be alive
If you're prone to second guessing"

Hey pretty smiling people, we're alright together
We're alright together
Hey pretty shining people, we're alright together
We're alright together, he-ey

Don't we all need love?
The answer is easy
Don't we all need love?
The answer is easy
Don't we all need love?
The answer is easy

Hey pretty smiling people, we're alright together
We're alright together
Hey pretty shining people, we're alright together
We're alright together
Hey pretty smiling people, we're alright together
We're alright together
Hey pretty shining people, we're alright together
We're alright together, he-ey
