I've watched the whole world drowning in chemicals
Dissociative, but it takes its toll
Can I surpass time, or would I start to rust?
Depreciating, collecting dust
And I fear for myself as I fall away
In a cold deluded sense of fate
When the nightmares come, and the doubt sets in
Will the fever break,
or will I burn from within?

It's too late to feel, I've lost my breath
With the hands of time around my neck
Am I more than the pen that wrote the past
Or am I just the sand enslaved by the hourglass?

Will I live again, or will I fade to black?
Dehumanizing, when the heart attacks
Will I expire before my dreams unfold?
But if the future's so bright, the path should glow
As the walls melt
And the light fades
I'm letting quicksand take me
As the walls melt
And the light fades
I'm letting quicksand take me

It's too late to feel, I've lost my breath
With the hands of time around my neck
Am I more than the pen that wrote the past
Or am I just the sand enslaved by the hourglass?

If you look beyond the blindfold
You'll find the hole in my soul
One fear, one mind,
no hope, no time

If you look beyond the blindfold
You'll find the hole in my soul
I'm on the edge of my seat
Holding out for a sign

Trying to rewrite the storyline
It's too late to feel, I've lost my breath
With the hands of time around my neck
Am I more than the pen that wrote the past
Or am I just the sand enslaved by the hourglass?

It's too late to feel, I've lost my breath
With the hands of time around my neck
Am I just the pen that wrote the past
Or am I just the sand enslaved by the hourglass?
Fear is not my fate
