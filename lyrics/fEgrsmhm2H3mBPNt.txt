If only I didn't want the world,
I wouldn't make you feel so sad.
I'm sure my shame would be gone.
Is it human to adore life?
If only I'd hidden my lust
and starved a little bit more.
If only I didn't ask for more.
Is it human to adore life?
I adore life.
If only I'd lived beyond regret,
I wouldn't feel guilt for what I take. Is it human ask for more?
is it human to adore life
I know evil when I see it, I know good and I just do it.
If I hadn't been so starved.
Is it human to adore life?
I understand the urgency of life
in the distance
there is truth which cuts like a knife.
Maybe. I will die maybe tomorrow, so I need to say-
I adore life.
If only I'd been more shy
and hid every tear I cry.
If only I didn't wish to die.
Is it human to adore life?
If only I didn't care so much, for the feel of your cold, cold touch.
and every bed I leave behind,
is it human to adore life?
I understand the urgency of life
in the distance
there is truth which cuts like a knife.
Maybe. I will die maybe tomorrow, so I need to say.
I adore life.
I adore life.
I adore life.
I adore life.
I adore life.
