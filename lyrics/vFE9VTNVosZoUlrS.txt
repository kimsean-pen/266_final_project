Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
I've made the change
I won't see you tonight

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me I cared for and loved

Building up inside of me
A place so dark, so cold
I had to set me free
Don't mourn for me, you're not the one to place the blame
As bottles called my name
I won't see you tonight

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me I cared for and most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way, please don't forget me
Or cry while I'm away

Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
But I've made the change
I won't see you tonight

So far away, I'm gone
Please don't follow me tonight
And while I'm gone everything will be alright

No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight
No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight
