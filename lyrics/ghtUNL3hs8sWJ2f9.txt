Don't act like you're jealous when you're not
Cause I'm caught between
Know you could kill us and I can't let go, you see
It's clear that I'm just your distraction
I make my bed but
Don't act like you're jealous when you're not

We had a breakdown, you just can't help yourself
We had an understanding, now look at us
It was all good until your lies came out
Oh, don't act like you're jealous cause you're not

I'm just your distraction
Don't act like you're jealous
I'm just your distraction
Don't act like you're jealous
I'm just your distraction

Don't act like you're into me when you're not
Cause I guarantee, I'ma show you how I be
My sleeves rolled up, no referee
It's clear that I'm just your distraction
I make my bed but
Don't act like you're into me when you're not

We had a breakdown, you just can't help yourself
We had an understanding, now look at us
It was all good, until your lies came out
No, don't act like you're jealous cause you're not

I'm just your distraction
Don't act like you're jealous
I'm just your distraction
Don't act like you're jealous
I'm just your distraction

No more, no more
Don't wanna push me 'til my heart is torn apart
No more, no more
Believe me this is something that you wanna start

I'm just your distraction
Don't act like you're jealous
I'm just your distraction
Don't act like you're jealous
I'm just your distraction
Don't act like you're jealous
I'm just your distraction
Don't act like you're jealous
I'm just your distraction
