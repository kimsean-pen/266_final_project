There's a change
In the wild
Shot in waves
Pushing time
And I see the days
Turn to night
And taking in all my peripheral thoughts into feeling
It's a pulse inside my lungs
I see sky where once was ceiling
Leaving the fact I can change the world
Cause I think I could
You used to come my way
I used to feel like I could not open up
But now I am free

It's a shame
This is life
With everything at our disposal
While we stayed inside
Most our lives
Hoping to God for a better one until we die
I used to hold that chain
I used to carry the weight of all my problems here with me
But now I come through
But now, now I come through

It's awake
For the rush
The promise of what we all want if we pull from inside
Close your eyes
The moment is taking me closer, it keeps me alive
I used to run away
I used to hide from these walls that gave me life
But now I can breathe

Do you remember me like I remember you?
Do you remember me like I remember?
Do you remember me like I remember you?
Do you remember me like I remember you?
