Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Oh, you are something I feel
I can't help but notice you
Feeling nothing now
Oh, you are something I feel
I can't help but notice you

I can't be away one more night
I can't make you stay if I tried
Everything is fading, fading, fading
Guess I gotta have that faith in, faith in

I can't make you stay if I tried
Everything is fading, fading, fading
Guess I gotta have that faith in, faith in
