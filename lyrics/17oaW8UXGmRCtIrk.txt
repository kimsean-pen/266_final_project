I spent two nights in K town, two nights in Brixton
Then to my ex's to see if I missed him
Contemplating, the wastemen I'm dating
And should I cut it out?
'Cause I'm coming to terms with my alter ego
Packed my pride and shelved my libido
Stopped my searchin', it's me that I'm hurtin'
And there's no room for doubt

I promised myself
I'd keep from his help
Don't need no one else

Just 'cause I'm afraid of lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-vin'
Don't mean I don't wanna lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ve him
Runnin' circles with no shame
(With no shame, with no shame)
But always comin' home to no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-thin'

So then I'm runnin' through East Street with emotional baggage
Asked a man if he'd give me a hand please
Holds it up and says, where is this weight from?
Told him it's years of accepting the cheap love
Little did I know he was a veteran
Little did I know he'd find my hand again
Chasin' up the South with some cherry wine
It's looking like there's something in the air tonight

I promised myself
I'd keep from his help
Don't need no one else

Just 'cause I'm afraid of lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-vin'
Don't mean I don't wanna lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ve him
Runnin' circles with no shame
(With no shame, with no shame)
But always comin' home to no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-thin'

Just 'cause I'm afraid of lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-vin'
Don't mean I don't wanna lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ve him
Runnin' circles with no shame
(With no shame, with no shame)
But always comin' home to no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-thin'

Runnin' circles with no shame
(With no shame, with no shame)
But always comin' home to no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-thin'
