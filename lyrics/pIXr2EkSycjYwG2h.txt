Honestly I thought your honesty meant something to you, in the end
All of your words were high there but I told myself I had not found love, once again
Tell me it's all in my head, tell me I imagined all of it
That there's no one else, so don't worry, but were always wiser in the end

Go on and lie to my face
Tell me again how you love me while kissing another girl
Lie to my face
Say that you need me, without us there's no other way
Tell me this won't ever end
Tell me it over and over again
Lie to me my friend

I saw you looking and her, you said you were friends but I know that you weren't
What is a girl meant to do, when she discovers a man is a fool
I know she's playing with you, but this ain't a game, I thought this here was true

So go on and lie to my face
Tell me again how you love me while kissing another girl
Lie to my face
Say that you need me, without us there's no other way
Tell me this won't ever end
Tell me it over and over again
Tell me this won't ever end
Tell me it over and over again

Lie to me
Oh, lie to me

Tell me this won't ever end
Tell me it over and over and over again
Lie to my face
Say that you need me, without us there's no other way
