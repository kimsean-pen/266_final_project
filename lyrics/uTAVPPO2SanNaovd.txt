Out of reach,
In the sky
Most of you, will never fly
Afraid to fail, afraid to try
But not me, I'd rather die

The trick the Devil did,
The trick the Devil did,
The trick the Devil did,
Was make me want it

Oh no, I'm fighting for my soul
I'm ready for the battle, most things I can handle
Ohhh,
Ohhh,
Ohhh,

The trick the Devil did,
The trick the Devil did,
The trick the Devil did,
Was make me want it

Long nights, longer road
Up ahead, we're all alone
And what I want, is what I'm owed,
Too late to stay, too late to go,

The trick the Devil did,
The trick the Devil did,
The trick the Devil did,
Was make me want it

Oh no, I'm fighting for my soul
I'm ready for the battle, most things I can handle
Oh no, I'm never letting go!
I saw my name in blood, so I'm ready for the trouble
Ohhh,
Ohhh,
Ohhh,

The trick the Devil did,
The trick the Devil did,
The trick the Devil did,
Was make me want it

And I can't resist anything of temptation
Oh no, I'm fighting for my soul
I'm ready for the battle, most things I can handle
Ohhh,
Ohhh,
Ohhh,

The trick, The trick The trick the Devil did,
Was make me want it
