Way away from home
And I don't know what to do
So I grab the telephone and call (?)

It rang, it rang, it rang
It rang again (?)
And then a big strange voice said "hello?"
Stop the ringing call (?)

And who is you?
I wonder who is you?
(?)
And who is you?
I wonder who is you?
(?)
Get out of my house, get out of my house, get out of my house now!
(?)
