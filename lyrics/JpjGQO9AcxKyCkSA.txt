take me everywhere you want to go
i can be your suitcase nobody has to know
i'm addicted to a real bad thing now
got a real bad thing going to take me out
take me all the way to the edge
tuck me into my deathbed
make me yours until the end
i'm addicted to a real bad thing now
got a real bad thing going to take me out
