All mixed up, turned around
Whatcha thinking about?
What were we talking about now?
Emotion free, euphoric state
Too little too late
Let it go

You pray for rain in hopes that it'll wash away
Let's be honest, you don't have that much faith
I think it's too late if you're looking to save us
I see you slipping from that, full of grace

Focus stuck, open doubt
You're thinking too loud
All that comes has to come down
At least you can say you tried to pray for rain

You pray for rain in hopes that it'll wash away
Let's be honest, you don't have that much faith
I think it's too late if you're looking to save us
I see you slipping from that, full of grace

Why do we ask for these selfish things?
Are we the only ones that need saving?
Save me
I think we were foolish in thought
Then again I'm probably wrong
I'm probably wrong

You pray for rain in hopes that it'll wash away
Let's be honest, you don't have that much faith
I think it's too late if you're looking to save us
I see you slipping from that
I see you slipping from that
I see you slipping from that
Full of grace
