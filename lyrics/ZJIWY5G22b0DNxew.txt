Who maddest one on the M One
Who hasn't stopped sucking his thumb
Who very straight and never grins
Who cares what car he's driving in

He is because he saw it on a commercial break
And if he doesn't get what he wants
Then he get a headache
Because he needs it, wants it, almost, loves it

He's here on his own, on globe alone
Here on his own

Who joined health club to glisten into hi-fi precision
Who mobile phone gives him the bone
Who very keen on Sharon Stone

He is because he saw it on a commercial break
And if he doesn't get what he wants
Then he get a headache
Because he needs it, wants it, almost, loves it

He's here on his own, on globe alone
Here on his own, on globe alone
And then he says

Who eats at the new brasserie
Who only ever gets merry
Who wouldn't be seen at bedtime
Without putting Calvin Klein's on

He is because he saw it on a commercial break
And if he doesn't get what he wants
Then he get a headache
Because he needs it, wants it, almost, loves it

He's here on his own, on globe alone
Here on his own, on globe alone
He's here on his own
