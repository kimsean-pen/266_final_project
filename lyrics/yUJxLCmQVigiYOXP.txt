I'm going out tonight
I'm gonna lose my mind
Dj heat me with another beat to give me life
The vibrations of basslines
Leave us goin' insane
With the melody of music flowin' through my veins
We're gonna make love to this club tonight
Give our bodies to the sounds of the night
Find my girl molly turn it up tonight
Bodies crashin' sweat is drippin' to the flashing lights
Uh uh

Take us to another level
Take us to a place we ain't never been
Raise your hands up pump the volume
Close your eyes let the music in

Let the music take control oh oh
Let it go oh oh
Tonight we're gonna murder the floor
When the music takes us up so high
We can touch the sky
Tonight we gonna lose control

Got a demon in my body sinning to this song
Dj heat me with a fix of my favorite wrong
This track is my religion turn the treble up
Pass the bottle take a sip from the devil's cup

Gonna leave my problems at the door tonight
Take out my anger on the floor all night
Dj use your rhythm guide my body tonight
Take the keys and drive the beat into my body and mind

Take us to another level
Take us to a place we're ain't never been
Raise your hands up pump the volume
Close your eyes let the music in

Let the music take control oh oh
Let it go oh oh
Tonight we're gonna murder the floor
When the music takes us up so high
We can touch the sky
Tonight we gonna lose control

Don't let the music stop
Keep it playin' all through the night
Keep this feeling till we see the sunlight
Dj keep this party alive

Let the music take control
Let the music take control
Let the music send our bodies into overload

Let the music take control oh oh
Let it go oh oh
Tonight we're gonna murder the floor
When the music takes us up so high
We can touch the sky
Tonight we gonna lose control
