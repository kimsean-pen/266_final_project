When you feel the chill -- 'flame, watered-down"
It's always like this -- "too lazy"
When you feel you're going insane -- "flame, watered-down"
It's always like this -- "just pour it down"
Overflow
Take a sip
Now, look at me
You'll be knocked out
It's been like this,
I've always found it's like this
Image, can't control, let it overflow -- "indeed"
Image, can't control, let it overflow -- "isn't it?"
a bunch of them falling down happily and randomly
When you feel the chill -- "disappear"
When was it that it was like this -- "disappear"
When was it that it was like this -- "flame, watered-down"
