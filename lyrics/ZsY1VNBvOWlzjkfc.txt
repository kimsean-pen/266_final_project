One day in the life of the lonely
Another day on the roundabout
What do they need, somebody to love
One night in the life of the lonely
There's a miracle on the screen
What did they see, somebody to love

He guarantees you instant glory
Get your money on the line

Got to send me a plastic Jesus
There's a cheque in the mail today
That's what I need, somebody to love
We just won't eat on Sunday
Got to buy him a limousine
Somewhere to live, somewhere to pray

Every penny from the people
Keeps the wolf outside the door
Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself
But he'll give you more, yeah

Holy father, holy ghost
Who's the one who pays the most
Rock the cradle, don't you cry
Buy another lullaby
Jack is nimble, Jack is quick
Pick your pocket, turn a trick
Slow and steady, he's got time
To commit another TV crime, TV crime

One day in the life of the lonely
Back again on the roundabout
What do they need, somebody to love, yeah
One night in the life of the lonely
Another miracle on the screen
What did they see, somebody to love again

A supermarket of salvation
Take a look inside the store
Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself
But he gives more

Holy father, holy ghost
Who's the one who hurt you most
Rock the cradle when you cry
Scream another lullaby
Jack be nimble, Jack be slick
Take the money, get out quick
Slow and steady, so much time
To commit another TV Crime, TV Crime
