I checked into a bargain-priced room in Lacienica,
gazed out through the curtains at the parking lot.
walked down to the corner store just before nightfall in my barefeet,
black tarry asphalt soft and hot.
And when i came back i spread out my supplies on the counter by the sink,
looked myself right in the eyes:
St. Joseph's baby aspirin, Bartles of Jane's, and you or your memory.
I ducked behind the drapes when i saw the moon begin to rise,
gathered in my loose ends, switched on the lights;
and down there in the dark i could see the real truth about me,
as clear as day,
Lord if i make it through tonight
then i will make my ammends and walk the straight path to the end of my days:
St Joseph's baby aspirin, bartles of Jane's, and you or your memory.
