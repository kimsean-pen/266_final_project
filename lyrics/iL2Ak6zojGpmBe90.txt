Fucked up in my head
Lay down in my bed
Touching your shirt
You know I want you bad
Watching you take off your pants

You make me feel
Bad about myself
I'm wasting my time
I can't be helped

Swallow my cum
I will make new friends
Taking off my clothes
Sober and aching, I'm cold

You make me feel
Bad about myself
I'm wasting my time
I can't be helped
