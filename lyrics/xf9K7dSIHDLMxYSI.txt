Say hello to the quiver
To the skin your spine
That skin moving pictures
Secret moments of time
That skin and your innards
Giving up your mind
Inside feed forever
As you wait in line

Say hello
As you go

Hear the call of your master
Try to speak there's no reply
Standing there with the nameless
And hear the silent cries
Look above at the ceiling
Realize accept your plight
Try to reach him
He will break you
Your weakness is his might

Say hello
As you go
