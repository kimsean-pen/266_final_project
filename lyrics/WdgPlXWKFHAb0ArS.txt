Now this is Genocide
The monster inside
The voices in your head
They're telling you to
Wash away
The crimson stains
To leave us all for dead

I know a way that you can cut every last tie

The friends you've made
How could you watch all of them die?
And every world that you destroy
Will burn as you planned
And in the end
They're gonna fall and
Fall to your hand
I see your mind
Now It's slipping faster
Kill or be killed
The only thing that matters
Across the land
All of their ashes scatter

Who's the monster now?
Now this is Genocide

The monster inside
The voices in your head
They're telling you to
Wash away
The crimson stains
To leave us all for dead
No one told you there's no going back
For once you attack
There's no way to prevent
Every single drop of blood you spill
Will stain

It's real
For death is permanent

You're just a monster

And now you're just a monster
And I can see it in your smile

And in your eyes
There's no compassion
No there's nothing left insided
Over and over
No you're never satisfied
Made your decision
Now you're gonna have a bad time
I see your mind
Now It's slipping faster
Kill or be killed

The only thing that matters
Across the land
All of their ashes scatter
Who's the monster now?
Now this is Genocide

The monster inside
The voices in your head
They're telling you to
Wash away
The crimson stains
To leave us all for dead
No one told you there's no going back
For once you attack
There's no way to prevent
Every single drop of blood you spill
Will stain
It's real
For death is permanent
You're just a monster
And now you're just a monster
And now you're just a monster
