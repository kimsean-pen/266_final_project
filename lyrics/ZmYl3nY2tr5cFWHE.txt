And what you see is really what you see
What you, what you, what you, what you
Do what you please, the thing what you see
What you, what you, what you, what you

And what you see you feel
Coming real, take your way
All through the way
Did you, did you, did you, did you
Did you, did you, did you, did you

And what you see you feel
Coming real, take your way
All through the way
Did you, did you, did you, did you
Did you, did you, did you, did you.
