Silence and quiet again in my life
Far from these moments, I wish I was
Passion and truth, we were about
Before the shadows stole the beat of our hearts
After all we have been through
I can only look at you
Through the eyes you lied to
I'm givin' up, givin' up, I'm givin' up on you
After all if there is no way out
If you cannot stand beside me
If there isn't love, there is only pride
I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up this fight
Undo this leash, well, you say I tied
When only our fears are to blame this time
And what am I to you? Just spit it out
I'm not afraid of the words that you hide
After all we have been through
I can only look at you
Through the eyes you lied to
I'm givin' up, givin' up, I'm givin' up on you
After all if there is no way out
If you cannot stand beside me
If there isn't love, there is only pride
I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up this fight
Where do we go? When did it all crash?
When did it start to fall apart?
Silence and quiet, passion, the truth
Wish I was, I wish I was
After all if there is no way out
If you cannot stand beside me
If there isn't love, there is only pride
I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up this fight
After all we have been through
I can only look at you
With the eyes you lied to
I'm givin' up, givin' up, I'm givin' up on you
After all if there is no way out
If you cannot stand beside me
If there isn't love, there is only pride
I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up this time
Givin' up, givin' up this fight
Givin' up, givin' up, givin' up
Givin' up, givin' up this fight
I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up tonight
Givin' up, givin' up, I'm givin' up
I'm givin' up, givin' up
I'm givin' up this fight
Givin' up, I'm givin' up
