See you falling
For the calling
See you fading
Into delusion
Execution
And confusion played a game
From the outside
There's a new end
On the inside
All for nothing
Guilt for something
But the outcome is the same

Everything we started
Burning up in flames
And the day we bought it
Then I learnt to do again
Kept my eyes wide open
In the end it's all the same
In the end it's all the same

Rivers gonna run and set us free
Love is gonna drown into the sea
Let tomorrow come
Don't cry for me
Crystalline
Crystalline
Rivers gonna run and set us free
Love is gonna drown into the sea
Let tomorrow come
Don't cry for me
Crystalline
Crystalline

Now it's all out
In the open
Was it worth it
Hell is broken
Out of me and
I'm addicted to the lies
I can't help me
When I lose it
I'm in heaven
But now I'm guilty
Now it hit me
I'm the one to pay the price

Everything we started
Burning up in flames
And the day we bought it
Then I learnt to do again
Kept my eyes wide open
In the end it's all the same
In the end it's all the same

Rivers gonna run and set us free
Love is gonna drown into the sea
Let tomorrow come
Don't cry for me
Crystalline
Crystalline
Rivers gonna run and set us free
Love is gonna drown into the sea
Let tomorrow come
Don't cry for me
Crystalline
Crystalline

Rivers gonna run and set us free
Love is gonna drown into the sea
Let tomorrow come
Don't cry for me
Crystalline
Crystalline
Rivers gonna run and set us free
Love is gonna drown into the sea
Let tomorrow come
Don't cry for me
Crystalline
