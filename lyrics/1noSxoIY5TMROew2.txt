Fine, I'm getting high
Not coming home tonight
Drive and nevermind
We've got time on our side

Don't try to slow me down
We've gotta keep going
We've gotta keep going

It's been so long since you let it go
Our life the way we know

I've got to say that something is gonna happen
I've got to say
I've got to say

Treta, treta, treta, treta, treta, aqui Ã© treta
Treta, treta, treta, treta, treta, muita treta

It's been so long since you let it go
Our life the way we know
