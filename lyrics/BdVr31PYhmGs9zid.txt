Last night I had a vision
I could live without permission
I'm in the kitchen breaking dishes
What's the difference if I don't nick one?
'Cause maybe they'll call me a joke
Like I'm Becky on coke
But I'm Britney on Lithium
Cut on my lips just to send you a kiss with 'em

I'm over rubbing my cunt
Send me a key to unlock me a bomb
We don't care about tongue
We got the numbers but don't want the sum

These days got me in a slump
White women voted for Trump
But this white woman bumping this white woman
If we point fingers then we just gon' fight women

Everyone's A-OK
If you don't look too hard
We could pretend we're happy
Like we know who we are
Everybody's doing just great
If you don't look too hard
We could pretend we're happy
Like we know who we are

Like we know who we are
Like we know who we are

There's nothing wrong with anyone
Everything's perfect
Don't have to call me anymore
'Cause everything's perfect
You hit me when the lights go dark
And say you gotta be, gotta be
Gotta be, gotta be strong
If you're the one that's doing me wrong
Then why I gotta be, gotta be
Gotta be, gotta be strong?
There's nothing wrong with anyone
Everything's perfect
Don't need to ask how I'm hanging on
I swear I'm fucking perfect

You hit me when the lights go dark
I'll tie you up, string you up
Blood in my sippy cup
Show your lovers who you are
Now you gotta be, gotta be
Gotta be, gotta be strong
There's nothing wrong with anyone
Everything's perfect
Don't need to ask how I'm hanging on
I swear I'm fucking perfect
