I'll be the silver lining around your fence
You use to protect yourself from all the world,
And its sharp teeth,
Because my open hand and heart think you belong with me.

You'll be,
Wrapped around my fingertips.
But my paralysis is indefinite
And my eyes are froze for you.

I'll be the silver lining around your fence
You use to protect yourself from all the world,
And its sharp teeth,
Because my open hand and heart think you belong with me.
I'll be the silver lining around your fence
You use to protect yourself from all the world,
And its sharp teeth,
Because I am all for you.

I was the one who kept myself standing tall,
You were the light at the end of the hall.
I followed bright signals sent my way,
Because I'm steady day by day.

So now I'm swimming in slow seconds with you.

I'll be the silver lining around your fence
You use to protect yourself from all the world,
And its sharp teeth,
Because my open hand and heart think you belong with me.
But still I'm fighting; still I'm fighting for you.
That's what it comes down to.
Still I'm fighting still I'm fighting for (you)
But still I'm fighting and
I'll just keep trying until it's all about what can't happen when you lose.
But still I'm fighting; still I'm fighting for (you.)

I'll be your silver lining.

Still I'm fighting & I'll just keep trying 'till
It's all about what can't happen when you lose
Still I'm fighting, still I'm fighting for you.
I'm fighting for you.
