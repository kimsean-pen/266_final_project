I'm feelin' too much like night
I need a little bit more day
I'm feelin' too much like a fight
I never have too much to say
You say you see so much in me
'Cause you see the God in me
And if you need my lovin' now
I will never let you down

And when I feel
Your touch
I never felt so loved
And when with my eyes
Wide shut
I never felt so loved
And baby when you're gone
I miss you so much
And baby when you're here
With me it's wonderful

Because
I never, I never
I never, never
Never felt so loved
I never, I never
I never, never
Never felt so loved
I never, I never
I never, never
Never felt so loved
I never, I never
I never, I
I never
Felt so loved

Now baby it's no small feat
For you to interrupt my sleep
I wanna feel you next to me
Listenin' to the Iseleys
You say you see so much in me
'Cause you see the God in me
And if you need my lovin' now
I will never let you down

And when I feel
Your touch
I never felt so loved
And when with my eyes
Wide shut
I never felt so loved
And baby when you're gone
I miss you so much
And baby when you're here
With me it's wonderful

I never, I never
I never, never
Never felt so loved
I never, I never
I never, never
Never felt so loved
I never, I never
I never, never
Never felt so loved
I never, I never
I never, I
I never
Felt so loved
