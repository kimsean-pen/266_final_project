Someone like you wasn't meant to be defined
Or confined or even met eye to eye
Just meant to be explored and then adored
Someone like you, someone like you

Someone like you, is so beautifully designed
From the hands, all the way to the mind
Just meant to be explored, and oh, adored
Someone like you, someone like you

La la la la lalalalala
La lalalala
