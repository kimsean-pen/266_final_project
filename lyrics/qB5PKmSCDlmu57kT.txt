If you're looking out your window
And you say you're gone
And you're staring at the ceiling
And where we're from

Remember when you wake up
Don't forget, turn out the light
'Cause I'm looking out my window
For you every night, oh

Did you have a thought
Did you remember what
And if we go sailing
Down the old oh front

If you're looking out your window
When you ride away
And you're staring at the ceiling

To try and get away
You told us to decide
What we want today
But I don't know, oh

Did you have a thought, oh
Did you remember what
And if we go sailing
Down the old, oh front, ooh

Did you have a thought oh
Did you remember what
And if we go sailing
Down the old, oh front

Did you have a thought
Did you remember what
Did you write a letter
Did you not forget her
