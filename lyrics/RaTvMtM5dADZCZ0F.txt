I listen to the sirens as they sing me back to sleep
I pray that no one's seriously hurt
It feels like everything is dying at the pivot point of me
I listen to the sirens tell me things could still be worse

'Cause if you close your eyes and listen close
You can hear the chapter close
And it's all rebound in better clothes
And you like the way this story goes

'Cause the sun still burns the shadows out
And there's nothing to complain about now

'Cause if this was our destiny I'd treasure the fact
And I'd give you what's left of me if I'd held back
But I don't need a soul, no I don't need a soul to hold
Without you I'm still whole, you and life remain beautiful
You and life remain beautiful

Departing from the hospital, the news shows on your face too well
You're trying not to cough at all it hurts
All options are exhausted, all your numbered days are numbered small
I miss you now, I loved you and I know things could still be worse

But if you close your eyes and listen close
You can hear the chapter close
And it's all rebound in better clothes
And you like the way this story goes

'Cause the sun still burns the shadows out
And there's nothing to complain about now

'Cause if this was our destiny I'd treasure the fact
And I'd give you what's left of me if I'd held back
But I don't need a soul, no, I don't need a soul to hold
Without you I'm still whole, you and life remain beautiful
You and life remain beautiful, you and life remain beautiful

Close your eyes and listen close
You can hear the chapter close
And it's all rebound in better clothes
And you like the way this story goes

'Cause the sun still burns the shadows out
And there's nothing to complain about now

Yeah, I don't need a soul, no, I don't need a soul to hold
Without you I'm still whole, you and life remain beautiful
Yeah, I don't need a soul, no, I don't need a soul to hold
Without you I'm still whole, you and life remain beautiful
You and life remain beautiful, you and life remain beautiful
