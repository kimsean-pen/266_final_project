I forgot to take my meds today
I can't believe it's only Tuesday
Figures it'd hit me on the highway
I forgot to take my meds today

I know I can't do fun things after work
Cause I'm too scared to smile
And risk the effort
I'm sorry you don't feel loved right now
I'm having trouble pretending to be myself

I feel like I'm grounded in bubblegum
When I try to move
I'm sinking in quicksand
With one arm reaching out

I forgot to take my meds today
I can't believe it's only Tuesday
Figures it'd hit me on the highway
I forgot to take my meds today

I forgot to take my meds today
I can't believe it's only Tuesday
Figures it'd hit me on the highway
I forgot to take my meds today
I forgot to take my meds
