You know...
It's not all it seems
Underneath it all
We're all human beings

Girl on the screen
Look at me
I never would have guessed that we'd be friends
Oh, but you don't want to be seen with me
I wanna see what you see
We're living in a world that's full of hate
Oh, but you don't care what they say
Do you?

Because...
I'm just an ordinary superstar
So far but always hanging where you are
I'm just an ordinary superstar
I'm just like you

I'm just an ordinary superstar
So far but always hanging where you are
I'm just an ordinary superstar
I'm just like you
