Eighty pounds of me have turned to cipher
and debris in preparation of a future moving in
I was not sufficient with a low nocturnal
vision and resilient but retrograding skin
Sure I am excited to be happily invited,
though a wire has been gnawing like a mole
This is not the lie I had expected to apply
when I was dragging my deformity down the hole

Down the hole

I am fit for every stage of labor in the
golden age of marrying technology and mind
Thanks to the ambition of my physical
edition I am taller than the man I left behind
I have good intentions but a few of my
extensions are sharpening the ending of a pole
This is not the lie I had expected to apply
when I was dragging my deformity down the hole

This is what you made of me
A big mistake
This is what you gave to me
Another traitor
Another traitor

This is what you made of me

This is what you made of me
A big mistake
This is what you gave to me
Another traitor
Another traitor

A failed creator
