If I could give this all back
I would be home in the morning
I'd wake up in a cold sweat
Take a flight back to the city I was born in

I would wipe myself clean
Of what I knew was unimportant
I'd want typical things
I'd try to fit back into all my old clothing

And I would prove myself wrong
That all along the problem was me
With all my bitterness gone
Happy, I'd be

I'll move back home forever
I'll feed the dogs
And I'll put all my pieces back together
Where they belong
And I'll say
I'm a mess
I'm a mess, oh god
I'm a mess

And I'll take 89 to Boston
See my love
And I'll help her
Set up her new apartment
And we'll get drunk and she'll say
Shit, you're a mess, you're a mess
Good god, you're a mess
Oh, you're a mess, you're a mess
Good god

So I paid off my debts
But I found the world boring
So I called my old friends
But they only ever ask me how tour is

And there's still weight on my back
I just try to ignore it
And I guess the stage was my mask
I forgot the way I looked before I wore it

And I would prove myself wrong
That all along the problem was me
With all my bitterness gone
Happy, I'll be

I'll move back home forever
I'll feed the dogs
And I'll put all my pieces back together
Where they belong
And I'll say
I'm a mess
I'm a mess, oh god
I'm a mess

And I'll take 89 to Boston
See my love
And I'll help her
Set up her new apartment
And we'll get drunk and she'll say
Shit, you're a mess, you're a mess
Good god, you're a mess
Oh, you're a mess, you're a mess

Life's not what I had hoped
Now I'll find comfort in the cold

I'll move back home forever
I'll feed the dogs
And I'll put all my pieces back together
Where they belong and I'll say
I'm a mess
I'm a mess, oh god
I'm a mess

And I'll take 89 to Boston
See my love
I'll help her
Set up her new apartment
And we'll get drunk and she'll say
Shit, you're a mess, you're a mess
Good god, you're a mess
Oh, you're a mess, you're a mess
Good god
