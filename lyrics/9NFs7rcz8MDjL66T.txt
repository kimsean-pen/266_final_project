You know I've been working hard
And later I got a show
But I've been thinking 'bout you
Now, I don't want to go

If I come pick you up
We'll get around about 4
Baby, close the door
Don't let 'em see what's going on

Pre-chorus
Lay back, take a sip
Hold your breath, let's take a dip
And just sink into the blue
Lay back, take a pick
Where do you want me to kiss?
Ain't nothing I'd rather do

In the afternoon
Not much that I wanna do except you
I think I'm way too in love with you
Can we just lay by the swimming pool now
'Cause I need to cool down (ooh ahh)
I need to cool down (ooh ahh)
I need to cool down (ooh ahh)
I need to cool down (ooh ahh)
I need to cool down

Baby, it's getting hot
I think we should take it inside
After this liquor kicking in
I feel about right

I cancel my work today
Just for my princess
Put her on my checklist
It's time to get down to business

Pre-chorus
Lay back, take a sip
Hold your breath, let's take a dip
And just sink into the pool
Lay back, take a pick
Where do you want me to kiss?
Ain't nothing I'd rather do

In the afternoon
Not much that I wanna do except you
I think I'm way too in love with you
Can we just lay by the swimming pool now
'Cause I need to cool down (ooh ahh)
I need to cool down (ooh ahh)
I need to cool down (ooh ahh)
I need to cool down (ooh ahh)
I need to cool down
