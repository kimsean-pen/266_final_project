Someone is sitting there
Someone who doesn't care
Someone who only stares

No one is on your side
You've got nowhere to hide
There's no white horse to ride away

No more white horses
For you to ride away
No more white horses
So you must stay

Where you are
Where you are

No more white horses
For you to ride away
No more white horses
So you must stay

Where you are
Where you are

No more white horses
For you to ride away
No more white horses
So you must stay
