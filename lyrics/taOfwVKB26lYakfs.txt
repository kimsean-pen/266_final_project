High
21st of July
You know the thought is all wrong
But the feeling is right

Say
On the 19th of May
Turn it on close the door
And then set to ignore

Hey, where did you come from?
And why don? t you stay where you belong?

Think
Everyone that you kiss
Do they cease2xist
When you stop being missed?

You live
In someone else? s song
Have you been there too long
Or not long enough?

Yes
What did you leave behind?
Another weekend expires
With no definite signs

Hey, where did you come from?
And why don? t you stay where you belong?

Hey, where did you come from?
And why don? t you stay where you belong?

Think
Everyone that you kiss
Do they cease2xist
When you stop being missed?

Hey, where did you come from?
And why don? t you stay where you belong?

Hey, where did you come from?
And why don? t you stay where you belong?

Think
Everyone that you kiss
Do they cease2xist
When you stop being missed?

Think
Everyone that you kiss
Do they cease2xist
When you stop being missed?
