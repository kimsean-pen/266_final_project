Twisted on a dead straight road
Haven't got a change of clothes
We just split
Call me crazy
But I think they might be onto us

Everybody else can eat my dust
Shall we make believe they're chasing us?
Make a wish for me baby
Cause I think they might be catching up

You're a thousand times mine
I'm a thousand times yours
A thousand times mine
And I want a thousand more

Until the vanishing point and baby
Not a moment before
You're a thousand times mine
And I am a thousand yours

As if the earth's reserved for you and I
Not a soul from miles
An isolated site
We just slipped off the radar
And I think they might be onto us

You're a thousand times mine
I'm a thousand times yours
A thousand times mine
And I want a thousand more

Ooh until the vanishing point and baby
Not a moment before
You're a thousand times mine
And I am a thousand yours
A thousand yours

Spectacular blacklight posting neon sky
To which the sun so quickly unsubscribes
Want to call it a night
But I think they might be onto us

Ooh until the vanishing point and baby
Not a moment before
You're a thousand times mine
And I am a thousand yours
A thousand yours
A thousand yours
