Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

World goes round, life I chose
What comes next I never really know
A million miles left to go
Them guns go pow, but I'm ready for the war
'Cause I'll never run away

From who knocking at my door
I never paid attention to whoever tells me no
I'll take your crown, take your town
Better stay ready, better stay ready

If the sky start falling now
And the world stop turnin' round (oh yeah)
Did you give your everything?
You better give your everything

'Cause if you wanna ride with me (oh yeah)
Make me come alive baby (oh yeah)
So if you wanna ride with me (oh yeah)
If you wanna ride with me

Show me how bad do you want it
How bad do you want it
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
How bad do you

Coming for it all, going for the gold
Hot behind the wheel, I'll never lose control
Sun go down, the night unfold
Run free and wild, do anything I want
'Cause I'll never run away
From who knocking at my door
I never paid attention to whoever tells me no
I'll take your crown, take your town
Better stay ready, better stay ready

If the sky start falling now
And the world stop turnin' round (oh yeah)
Did you give your everything?
You better give your everything

'Cause if you wanna ride with me (oh yeah)
Make me come alive baby (oh yeah)
So if you wanna ride with me (oh yeah)
If you wanna ride with me

Show me how bad do you want it
How bad do you want it
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
How bad do you

Better show me now
Before your time run out
Better show me
Before your time run out
Show me how bad do you want it
How bad do you want it

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Show me how bad do you want it
