I'm painted black and white
I've seen this all before
The moon hides in the sky
My anchor's way off shore
Do you know where the truth is?
Do you know where your heart is?
My eyes are seeing red
My memory is cursed
So when I go to bed
O, all my wounds are nursed
Do you know what it feels like?
Do you know how it burns so bright?
I watch your devil eyes as they deceive
Those who still believe in love like me
All you really wish is a true wish, feeling like you truly feel a thing
For too long I was blind
For too long I was lost
Now watch that tape unwind
I'll find whom I belong
The tide is turning, am I drowning? C
Can't let myself lose my poise
Well I'm starting to believe this ship is going down

I watch your devil eyes as they deceive
Those who still believe in love like me
All you really wish is a true wish, feeling like you truly feel a thing
