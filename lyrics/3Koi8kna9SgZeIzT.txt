making every day renew
mostly just thinking of you
most heartily with gratitude
but your methods were all tried and true

a world of trouble inside of me grow
i feel it move i feel it flow
my story writes itself untrue
it won't be long i'll see you soon

we spent life inside of our heads
couple together wires of red
we built a fort so strong to hold
for times of harsh and winters of cold
we spent all the beauty we made
memories by hand to replay
hear these simple words unfold
for this occasion i chose

you and me we spent our days
trapped inside our thickening haze
slowly running out of ways
to reinvent our shrinking maze

once i was shiny and new
unsteady like a silent gloom
who knew what i would turn into
who knwos my world who shares my view

we spent life inside of our heads
couple together wires of red
we built a fort so strong to hold
for times of harsh and winters of cold
we spent all the beauty we made
memories by hand to replay
hear these simple words unfold
for this occasion i chose
