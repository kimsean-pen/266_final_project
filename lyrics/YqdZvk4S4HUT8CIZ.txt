perverted within a viewing
standing alone
it took the night to believe
the beacon lingers
come to grasp

repeatedly defiling the wind's daughter

dialates full
unurished
in salutations to the crescent eye

(vibrate)
cry yourself to ash
(believe)
(vibrate)
a perfect silhouette
(defile)
(vibrate)
the beacon lingers
(vibrate)
cry yourself to ash
(believe)
(vibrate)
the beacon lingers
(defile)
(vibrate)
cry yourself to ash
(vibrate)
a perfect silhouette
(vibrate)
it took the night to believe
