Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Maybe he'll know, why
I'm not so sure
Maybe he'll know, why
Maybe he'll be, be my cure

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Maybe he'll know, well
I'm not so sure
Maybe he'll know, well
Maybe he'll be, oh oh

Something calls to me, I know
I hear an echo start to pound like a drum
Chanting a song, anchor me
But don't take too long

Say you'll never go, no you never
(No, no)
Say you'll never go, no you never
(I got this anxious feeling)
Say you'll never go, no you never
Say you'll never go, no you never
(I got this ache engraved in me like stone)

Say you'll never go, no you never
(Don't take too long)
Say you'll never go, no you never
(Say you'll never leave me)
Say you'll never go, no you never
Say you'll never go, no you never
(Say you never go)
No, no no, no no

Maybe he'll know, why
I'm not so sure
Maybe he'll know, why
Maybe he'll be, be my cure

Maybe he'll know, why
I'm not so sure
Maybe he'll know
Maybe he'll be, oh oh

Something calls to me, I know
I hear an echo start to pound like a drum
Chanting a song, anchor me
But don't take too long

Say you'll never go, no you never
(No, no)
Say you'll never go, no you never
(I got this anxious feeling)
Say you'll never go, no you never
Say you'll never go, no you never
(I got this ache engraved in me like stone)

Say you'll never go, no you never
(Don't take too long)
Say you'll never go, no you never
(Say you'll never leave me)
Say you'll never go, no you never
Say you'll never go, no you never
(Say you never go)

Say you'll never go, no you never
(Don't take too long)
Say you'll never go, no you never
(I got this anxious feeling)
Say you'll never go, no you never
Say you'll never go, no you never
(I got this ache engraved in me like stone)

Say you'll never go, no you never
(Don't take too long)
Say you'll never go, no you never
(Say you'll never leave me)
Say you'll never go, no you never
No, no you'll never, no no you never
(Say, say you'll never leave me)
