Outnumbered, alone
Three hundred strong
Only the best will hold this place of doom
Against the empire
A god on its throne
Hearts made for battle and we die alone

Tonight, we will dine in hell
Tonight, we will make them pay
Tonight, Ares will know our names
Know our names

Tonight, we will dine in hell
Tonight, we will make them pay
Tonight, no one will stay alive
Stay alive

(Ahoo!) Sparta!
(Ahoo!) Sparta!
(Ahoo!) Sparta!
(Ahoo!)

Into the fray, this is our last stand
Even immortals will die by our hands
Into the fire, accept no defeat
For Sparta, for freedom, we will not retreat

Tonight, we will dine in hell
Tonight, we will make them pay
Tonight, Ares will know our names
Know our names

Tonight, we will dine in hell
Tonight, we will make them pay
Tonight, no one will stay alive
Stay alive

Tonight, we will dine in hell
Tonight, we will make them pay
Tonight, Ares will know our names
Know our names

Tonight, we will dine in hell
Tonight, we will make them pay
Tonight, no one will stay alive
Stay alive

(Ahoo!) Sparta!
(Ahoo!) Sparta!
(Ahoo!) Sparta!
(Ahoo!) Sparta!
(Ahoo!) Sparta!
(Ahoo!) Sparta!
