All of our lives we've been told what to believe
"Nothing is perfect"
So what's the point of purpose?
The line that separates the weak from us who truly care, is one I don't intend to cross

The heart of man beats but only in greedy hands
And it seems that most are still content
Where most are comfortable accepting insignificance
We strive to find the effort within

If you open up your eyes, and open up your mind
You we be exposed to a world as cold as those who are left to populate it
Two decades spent swallowing lie after lie, has sparked a fire in my heart
And the time has come to spread the flame

We can't continue wasting time
Day after day trying to find a new means of escape
We can't continue wasting time
Day after day

I do it day after day
I do it day after fucking day

And I can't face the disconnect
I'll shed the dead weight and rise
And I can't face the disconnect
I'll shed the dead weight and rise

I never thought that I would need to justify a reason
To continue on in this life I lead
I fucking hate the world
I fucking hate myself
I swore I'd never fucking feel like this

And I hate the world
And I hate myself
I hate the world
