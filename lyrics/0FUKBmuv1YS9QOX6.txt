Yeah I'm weak it's, that's my only weakness
You gon' leave me speechless, I can't beat this fever
Yeah I'm speeding, I am off the meter
I am not a dreamer, I could be your teacher
Nice to meet you, wouldn't wanna be you
For you I am see through, can't you see I need you
I can treat you good if I can reach you
In the night I beep you, like I'm R2-D2
20 stacks, I spent that on trees
And you can't smoke that with me
You can't even talk to me, my agency need a fee
Got the gift, God gave it to me
They wanna take it from me
What do you want me to be
Make a wish, it'll turn it to me
Botox lips, goodnight kiss
Blood and spit, I wait for it
Are you up, try this, gloves don't fit
Hands don't grip, six dices
Botox lips, goodnight kiss
Blood and spit, I wait for it
Are you up, try this, gloves don't fit
Hands don't grip, six dices
Botox lips, goodnight kiss
Blood and spit, I wait for it
Are you up, try this, gloves don't fit
Hands don't grip, six dices
