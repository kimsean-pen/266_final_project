On your spine I felt so small
And if i could, i'd leave it all
Clip my wings and fall where I have to fall
You are the wind that took my all
You are the wind that took my all

Throughout the nights we felt so small
Believed my life was nothing more
Clip my wings and fall where I have to fall
You are the wind that took my all
You are the wind that took my all
