Strange places
Blurry faces
They don't know 'bout me
They don't know 'bout me
Blank faces
Conversations
They don't know 'bout me
They don't know 'bout me

Ah ah aahh, that don't mean nothing
I'm still dancing alo-o-one
Strange places
Blurry faces
Keep my mouth shut and my eyes wide open

(Eyes wide o-open)

So, everywhere that i turn my eyes
Catching fire, they burn mine

Blind
Blinded by the anticipation
People talk
Rumours fly
So I just rock with the night
Cause all I got is me, myself, and I

Ah ah aahh, that don't mean nothing
I'm still dancing alo-o-one
Strange places
Blurry faces
Keep my mouth shut and my eyes wide open

(Eyes wide o-open)

Ah ah aahh, that don't mean nothing
I'm still dancing alone, oh ooh
Strange places
Blurry faces
Keep my mouth shut and my eyes wide open
