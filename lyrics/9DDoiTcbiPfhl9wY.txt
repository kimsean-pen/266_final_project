On a cold and windy morning
Said goodbye to my old friends
They were hangin' around the corner
They were stayin' till the end, till the end

On the other side of midnight
I was lookin' for a place to stay
And one thing's sure for certain
I ain't never goin' back again, no more

The streetlights looked so pretty
As they spread into a town
I was lookin' for another sundown
And my head was spinnin' round and round
Round and round

Lookin' through the eyes of a stranger
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Lookin' through the eyes of danger
Lookin' at the all-night dancer
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Never takin' all the chances
Of a stranger

As I walked into the main street
Saw a crowd across the square
And I heard a guitar playin'
And I saw you standing there, standing there

Lookin' through the eyes of a stranger
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Lookin' through the eyes of danger
Lookin' at the all-night dancer
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Never takin' all the chances
Of a stranger

Distant bells they started ringing
Somewhere far off in the night
And the place was full of loneliness
That disappeared from sight

Lookin' through the eyes of a stranger
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Lookin' through the eyes of danger
Lookin' at the all-night dancer
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Never takin' all the chances
Of a stranger, lookin' through the eyes of a stranger

I am never going back
Never going back
Never going back
Never going back...
