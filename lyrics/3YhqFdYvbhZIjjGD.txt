You Can Do Anything

Carole King

The sun is shining but not on me
Another lonely day
What's the use in making plans
When nothing's gonna go my way
But there's a voice down deep inside me telling me what to say

Don't you know that you can do anything
You can take anything and make it your own
Don't you know that you can do anything
And you don't have to do it alone

Searching for the girl I was
When I was sure and strong
When everything was easier
And I could do no wrong
If I could only believe in myself
I know I could find a way

Don't you know that you can do anything
You can take anything and make it your own
Don't you know that you can do anything
And you don't have to do it alone

Sorry tears in my eyes
Got me down in confusion and doubt
Suddenly I realize
I'm no different than anyone working it out
We're all working it out

Don't you know that you can do anything
You can take anything and make it your own
Don't you know that you can do anything
And you don't have to do it alone

The sun is shining but not on me
Another lonely day
What's the use in making plans
When nothing's gonna go my way
But there's a voice down deep inside me telling me what to say

Don't you know that you can do anything
You can take anything and make it your own
Don't you know that you can do anything
And you don't have to do it alone

Searching for the girl I was
When I was sure and strong
When everything was easier
And I could do no wrong
If I could only believe in myself
I know I could find a way

Don't you know that you can do anything
You can take anything and make it your own
Don't you know that you can do anything
And you don't have to do it alone

Sorry tears in my eyes
Got me down in confusion and doubt
Suddenly I realize
I'm no different than anyone working it out
We're all working it out

Don't you know that you can do anything
You can take anything and make it your own
Don't you know that you can do anything
And you don't have to do it alone
