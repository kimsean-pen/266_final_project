Take a little look at yourself
Watch a soul leave the cemetery
Find a little fight in those eyes
And awaken to light across the sky

Dream a little harder this time
I'll await you to make the journey
Letting go the love realize
It's as much of the end, as is the ride

I await you again
I can feel your touch
I call your name to the wind
And into the nightfall my love

Carry up the worst of yourself
To a maze so in-ordinary
Get a little taste of it all
And awaken so new, your friends, a child

If you want to stay through the night
Hear the footsteps and sullen stories
Feels like the night of your life
All the reason to brave the smiles

And I, await you again
I can feel your touch
I call your name to the wind
And into the nightfall my love

I keep your heart next to mine
And when the nights get rough
I reach for you deep inside
I reach for you there, my love
