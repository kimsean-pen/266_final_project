If I could ask for anything
I'd only want my girl
I've seen a lot of things
Going on all around the world

I had to leave her all alone
I wrote this down so I could let her know
That I only want to see her

You should take this heart of mine
She'll always have that heart of mine
Always have that heart of mine
Always have that heart of mine

If I could win the lottery
We'd sail across the world
Travel to the Phillipines
Buy an island just for you and me

Girls on the equator
Never even compared
I only want to see her

You should take this heart of mine
She'll always have that heart of mine
You should take this heart of mine
She'll always have that heart of mine
Always have that heart of mine
Always have that heart of mine

You should take this heart of mine
She'll always have that heart of mine
You should take this heart of mine
She'll always have that heart of mine

Always have that heart of mine
Always have that heart of mine
Always have that heart of mine
