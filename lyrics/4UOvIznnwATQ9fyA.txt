I'll try to stay out of your way
And admire you from across the room
'Cause I love to stare at your face
I won't apologize for things that I did
Or anything said as I expect you to do the same
But don't forget that I'm the only one left
Who still tries to get in your head
I don't appreciate your fake smiles
I don't, I don't
I won't laugh at your stupid jokes
I won't, I won't
Has time broken your soul?
I think it's time for you to let go
You're insane and cancelled in my brain
And we both took our respective jokes,
Too seriously
But how long can you stay mad at me?
Without looking up, from the drunken slouch on the couch
Sitting across from me
Tell me is it really that easy,
To forget?
That I'm the only one left
Who still wants to bite into your flesh
I don't appreciate your fake smiles
I don't, I don't
I won't laugh at your stupid jokes
I won't, I won't
Has time broken your soul?
I think it's time for you to let go
You're insane and cancelled in my brain
•••
And how is it fair
When I don't even talk to you
You hear what I say
And dismiss the things that I can't prove
I was such a fool, to ever believe in you
I don't appreciate your fake smiles
I don't, I don't
I won't laugh at your stupid jokes
I won't, I won't
Has time broken your soul?
I think it's time for you to let go
You're insane and cancelled in my brain
