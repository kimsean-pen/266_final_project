We lay decumbant,
Under the horns of the cresent moon...
Destined to degust omnipotence.
We naturally incubate,
Slowly covering in crust...
And migrate into morpheus dimensions.

A reunion for the deceased to achieve universal knowledge...
Seeking a destination of desolation,
Far beyond the tormentor...
Forms out of fog, a permanent dusk.

The night in which the myths are to be acknowledged...
If not so, dismemberment in return...
Embrace what destiny reveals, but you'll fall...
Thoughts of my agonies go back to when life was not entered.

No one shall miss the secretions from your marrow...
Drenched in accumualated impurities, I would not let this
slip by.
An entity takes over your body, it is the keeper, guider...
Trust your mentor to the deep...
Your mind will wander as presentiments of your death
Peak to a state of confusion.
