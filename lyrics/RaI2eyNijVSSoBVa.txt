It's not my way to love you just when no one's looking.
it's not my way to take your hand if i'm not sure,
it's not my way to let you see what's going on inside of me,
when it's a love you'll not be needing, you're not free.
please stop pulling at my sleeve if you're just playing,
if you'll not take the things you make me want to give,
i never cared too much for games and this one's driving me insane.
you're not half as free to wander as you claim.
i'm easy, i'm easy. say the word, i'll play your game,
as though that's how it ought to be. i'm easy.
don't lead me on if there's nowhere for you to take me,
if loving you will have to be a sometime thing.
i can't put bars on my insides; my love is something i can't hide
i still hurt when i recall the times i've tried. i'm easy, i'm easy.
take my hand and pull me down.
i won't put up any fight, because i'm easy.
don't do me favors, let me watch you from a distance,
cause when you're near, it's hard for me to keep my head.
when your eyes throw light at mine, it's enough to change my mind
make me leave my cautious ways and world behind.
i'm easy. i'm easy.
