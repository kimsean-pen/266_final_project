Can't count the troubles on my mind
It's like the blind leading the blind
When I tell myself to breath
But I'm the beauty I'm the beast
I'm a storm that's been released
I'll always get back on my feet

And I
Oh I've tried, tried to be a better me, tried to meet my destiny
And I
Oh I've tried, tried to be a better me, mm

To find my way back home
It's all I've ever known
To find my way back home
Home
Home
I'll never get the waters as I wrong
To find my way back home (Home)
It's all I've ever known
To find my way back home
Home
Home
I'll never get the waters as I wrong

Wish I could photograph the moment
Find the beautiful atonement but it's slipping through my hands
You hear me sing the hallelujah
It will vibrate straight on through ya
Teach you just how much it hurts

And I
Oh I've tried, tried to find the best in me, mm
To find my way back home
It's all I've ever known

To find my way back home
Home
Home
I'll never get the waters as I wrong
To find my way back home

I'll keep on singing melodies even if they are just for me
I'll always get back on my feet
To find my way back home (home)
It's all I've ever known (known)
To find my way back home
Home
Home
I'll never get the waters as I wrong
To find my way back home (home)
It's all I've ever known (known)
To find my way back home
Home
Home
I'll never get the waters as I wrong
I'll find my way back home
