I feel, feel like a cokehead, I feel
Feel like I can't get drunk no more
'Cause I'm on the floor
Lookin' for some matches just to cook up a score
I feel, feel like shootin' up, I feel
Feel like givin' up on my skateboard
'Cause I'm fuckin' bored
I wanna perfect left down a Sunset Shore

I feel, feel like a crackhead, I feel
Feel like I'm not gonna make it no more
'Cause I'm on the floor
Just pick me up and give me some more
I feel, feel like I'm a grandpa, I feel
Feel like I'm already 80 years old
And my skin's so cold
I need a new body and I need a new soul

I feel, feel like gettin' drunk, I feel
Feel like fuckin' up my life again with all my friends
I hope we'll make it till the end
I feel, feel like shootin' up, I feel
Feel like I can't get laid no more
'Cause I'm on the floor
Just lookin' for some matches just to cook up a score

I feel, feel like a cokehead, I feel
Feel like I can't get drunk no more
'Cause I'm on the floor
Lookin' for some matches just to cook up a score
I feel, feel like shootin' up, I feel
Feel like givin' up on my skateboard
'Cause I'm fuckin' bored
I wanna perfect left down a Sunset Shore
