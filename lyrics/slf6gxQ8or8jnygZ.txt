I wasn't breaking
Any rules
There just wasn't the time
Then I'd break it down
I was someone so blind

Look darling
I suggest we hurry
The stars and all the gravy
Oh baby I know
Just let me be

That time we never wanted
Is now put into practice
Oh baby I know
Just let me dream

Look darling I suggest we hurry
This pounding oh so crazy
Oh baby I know
Just let me be

Look darling
I know that you're hanging around
There's confusion
And darkening clouds
I was someone
Someone who would disagree
Now Im here to
ride this lamborgini to you

I wasn't breaking
Any rules
There just wasn't the time oh
I would break it down
I was someone so blind

Look darling I suggest we hurry
The stars and all the gravy
They're burning out and
Now they're through

That time we never wanted
Is now put into practice
Oh baby I know
Just let me be

Look darling
I know that you're hanging around
There's confusion
And darkening clouds
I was someone
Someone who would disagree
Now Im here to
ride this lamborgini

Oh Im running ill
Somewhere else to you
Oh Im running ill
Somewhere else to you

Look darling I suggest we hurry
The stars and all the gravy
Oh baby I know
They're burning through

That time we never wanted
Is now put into practice
Oh baby I know
Just let me be

Look darling
I know that you're hanging around
There's confusion
And darkening clouds
I was someone
Someone who would disagree
Now Im here to
ride this lamborgini

Look darling
I know that you're hanging around
There's confusion
And darkening clouds
I was someone
Someone who would disagree
Now Im here to
ride this lamborgini
