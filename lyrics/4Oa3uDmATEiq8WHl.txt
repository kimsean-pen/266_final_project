Twilight's heartbeat
Heavens, you're aching
Fighting for your life
Controlled synthesized
In oscillation
Neon bleeds shattered bright

White hall servants
Muted believers
Silver drone machines
Controlled sacrifice
In isolation
Mirrors scream shattered light

Stranded in future shade
Ain't no one gonna save you tonight
Wait for the golden
Free the plague imprisoned inside
Stranded in future shade
Ain't no one gonna save you tonight
Free from the pain
That dismembers the mind

Wait for the future to cleanse from your head
Wait 'til those demons you've chased all have fled
Wait 'til you're no longer stranded in time
Sharp is the blade that severed you blind

Stranded in future shade
Ain't no one gonna save you tonight
Wait for the golden
Free the plague imprisoned inside
Stranded in future shade
Ain't no one gonna save you tonight
Free from the pain
That dismembers your mind
