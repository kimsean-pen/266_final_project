Yeah, I saw sparks fly
From the corner of my eye
And when I turned (whoo)
It was love at first sight
I said please excuse me
I didn't catch your name (whoa)
It'd be a shame
Not to see you again
And just when I thought
She was coming to my door
She whispered sweet
And brought me to the floor

She said
I'm only seventeen (seventeen)
I'll show you love like you've never seen
She's only seventeen (seventeen)
Daddy says she's too young

But she's old enough for me
Come to my place
We can talk it over (oh)
Everything going down in your head
She said take it easy
I need some time
Time to work it out
To make you mine
And just when I thought
She was coming to my door
She whispered sweet

And brought me to the floor
She said
I'm only seventeen (seventeen)
You ain't seen love
Ain't seen nothing like me

She's only seventeen
Seventeen... yeah!
Such a bad girl
Loves to work me over time
Feels good (ha)
Dancin' close to the borderline
She's a magic mountain
She's a leather glove (oh)

She's my soul
It must be love
She's only seventeen (seventeen)
The girl she gives me love like I've never seen
She's only seventeen (seventeen)
Daddy says she's too young
But she's old enough for me
Seventeen!
She's everything I need (seventeen)
Daddy says she's too young
But she's old enough
Old enough for me
Yeah! Yeah!
