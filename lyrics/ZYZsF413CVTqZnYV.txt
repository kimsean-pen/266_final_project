Red lips upon your suit
No bother I'm through with you
Trying to keep a few on the side
Baby you could never lie
Red lips upon your suit
No bother I'm through with you
It's really quite confusing
You're pushing me away and then you're pulling
You wear smug so very well
If you were in love with me I could never tell
It's time for you to go
But I've glued my feet to your floor
It's time for you to leave
But I've wrapped my hand around your leash
It's really quite confusing
You're pushing me away and then you're pulling
You wear smug so very well
If you were in love with me
I could never tell
You ask me you ask me just to leave you
but then the bow breaks and it's all through
You ask me you ask me just to leave you
But then the bow breaks and then it's all through
Boys make me way too tired
All the work they require
Why don't you get down on your knees?
All i do, i do for free
It's really quite confusing
You're pushing me away and then you're pulling
You wear smug so very well
If you were in love with me
I could never tell
