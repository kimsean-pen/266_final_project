Hideaway, well they'll seat us in the sun,
By the way, know you've always been the one,
You'll ask your reasons why,
What once was yours is mine,
My baby's gone.
Right away, gonna take me from my man,
By the way, no they'll never understand,
We'll have a bit of fun,
watching everyone,
Pass us by.
You'll ask your reason why,
What once was yours is mine,
My baby's gone.
