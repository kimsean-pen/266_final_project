I love the way you say my name
I'm in a love sick daze
So won't you stay?

Don't you try to deny, fight or hide
Cause eyes don't lie
I see the signs

Standing in your line of fire (fire, fire)
Sorry I'm a real bad liar (liar, liar)
You just blow me away, (you just blow me away)
You just blow me away, (you just blow me away)
You just blow me away.

(Going for the kill, you know you make me feel like a hunter)
(Going for the kill, you know you make me feel like a hunter)

It's insane, lame, a shame
I can't steal you away hey hey
what you say! let's escape!

Standing in your line of fire (fire, fire)
Sorry I'm a real bad liar (liar, liar)
You just blow me away, (you just blow me away)
You just blow me away, (you just blow me away).

(Going for the kill, you know you make me feel like a hunter)
(Going for the kill, you know you make me feel like a hunter)

Standing in your line of fire (fire, fire)
Sorry I'm a real bad liar (liar, liar)
You just blow me away, (you just blow me away)
You just blow me away, (you just blow me away)
You just blow me away, (you just blow me away)

You just blow me away.
