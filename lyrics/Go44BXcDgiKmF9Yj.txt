Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, whoa, back it up, now let me see your hips swing Now drop it low (and let me see your hips swing)
Down to the floor (now let me see your hips swing) Uh oh, lean back, girl you got some mean racks
You got a mean ass and I really mean that

But can't you see, that I need a girl, that can move
Make her hips swing and look just like you
But come to think about it, I think this club is crowded

It's kinda hard to do your thing when everyone's surrounding
So let me form a circle
Everybody step back

I heard somebody yell, "Where's the fuckin' party at?"

Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, whoa, back it up, now let me see your hips swing Now drop it low (and let me see your hips swing)
Down to the floor (now let me see your hips swing) Uh oh, let it pop, ladies, drop it like it's hot
Hell yeah, that's the spot, now bring it back to the top

Stop, whoa, now back it up, now back it up
Let it rise then watch it dump, shaking your junk in the trunk
And I like the way you move it smoothly

Now why don't you move that booty to me
I'm trying come up with some thoughts of attack,
Until I heard somebody yellin' out,
"Where's the fuckin' party at?"

Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy

Stop, whoa, back it up, now let me see your hips swing Now drop it low (and let me see your hips swing)
Down to the floor (now let me see your hips swing) Knees bent, ass out, come on push your ass out
Bring it up then back down, bring it up then back down
All my ladies on the floor, all my ladies on the floor
Pick it up then dip it low, pick it up then dip it low

Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, whoa, back it up, now let me see your hips swing Now drop it low (and let me see your hips swing)
Down to the floor (now let me see your hips swing)
