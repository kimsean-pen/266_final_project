Riding uptown with the windows up
Wake up in the 7th feeling lost as fuck
Grab the pills thrown them down cause i don't give a fuck
$uicide on my mind let me test my luck
Ridin' in the city of the AK's
Bullets with no name and they might spray
Ridin' in the city of the AK's
Bullets with no name and they might spray

I think i'm kinda dead
Feeling like a ghost, Half smoke
Away i go i'm tying rope
Ashes fucking shed off the tip of the blunt
Now i'm sunk from the junk
Oh no bout to fucking glow
Fuck a hoe, then i melt, I'm made of snow
