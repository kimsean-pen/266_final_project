Talk over the radio, that way everyone can hear.
Louder than the stereo, don't worry your head my dear.
I think it's hilarious, the way you talk about yourself
But don't tell that story again.
You're good one thing, I can't but calling you out
You're so lovely, I can't behave myself
Look into the mirror, I know you're good at that
Don't be so insecure, as long as you shut your mouth
Take yourself so serious, like you're talking for your health
But don't tell that story again.
You're good for one thing, I can't help but calling you out,
You're so lovely, I can't behave myself
Be slow. Anybody home?
You're good for one thing, I can't help but calling you out
And you're so lovely, I can not help myself
You're good for one thing, I can't help but calling you out
And you're so lovely, I can't behave myself
