I've a way to go
but I don't mind

He said he's gonna be waiting
counting time

I swear I'm starting over
you could be anyone
I'm sure I made you up
cause I'm just so overdone

I'm headed for The Great Sun

I haven't found a place I won't go
to fight the feeling that I am on my own

So when it's almost over
act like it's just begun
We're gonna get back to ourselves
we'll head for The Great Sun

I'm headed for The Great Sun
