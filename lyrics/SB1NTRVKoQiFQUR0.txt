Sit down, honey, let's kill some time.
Rest your head on this heart of mine.
Tell me, honey, cause you look so blue...
Just how did they, did they get to you?
I'm gonna spend it
Yours and mine.

Someone's in the kitchen
Cooking herats over the stove
Don't lie to me, never say goodbye to me
I don't want to be here alone
Someone's at the front door
Selling Band-Aids for our sores
You can bleed it, as long as they don't see it
I'm not going to be ignored

Come on darling, let's hang around.
Let's wreck their precious, their perfect town.
If it's all a dirty shame,
I'm gonna do it night and day.

Did you ever get the feeling
That you don't belong
Said the teacher in the classroom
I thing there's something wrong
But your desks are too heavy
And your walls are too white
Your rules are all wrong
And it's either run of fight
But I'm still running
I'm still running

Sit down, honey, let's kill some time.
Rest your head on this heart of mine.
Come on darling, let's hang around.
Let's wreck their precious, their perfect town.
If it's all a waste of time
I'm gonna spend it
Yours and mine.
