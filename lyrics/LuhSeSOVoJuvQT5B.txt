You wrote the plot out from the start and
Made yourself the beating heart I
Was the one who stole your crown
You were the one with the biggest mouth
Now if anti YOU means anti US than
I guess we just bit the dust cuz
In reverse it's still a pageant
OH SO CURSED AND NOT REAL MAGIC!!!

HA HA HA HA ARMAGEDDON

Just like Jim Jones you're charismatic
You spin your lies like an acrobat it
Pains me so having to see
You self destruct so publicly
But if anti YOU means anti US than
I guess we just bit the dust cuz
In reverse it's still a pageant
OH SO CURSED AND NOT REAL MAGIC

HA HA HA HA ARMAGEDDON

You're a roadblock, dressed like a solution
a ambush with no-ammunition
a pretty picture of a new trombone
a war started over a suburban lawn
I hear you talk talk
But I can tell you're more histrionic than historical
You're just a fake well read super mean girl
who I don't want anywhere near in my world
and if anti YOU means anti US
I guess we just bit the dust cuz
In reverse it's still a pageant

OH SO CURSED AND NOT REAL MAGIC

HA HA HA HA ARMAGEDDON
