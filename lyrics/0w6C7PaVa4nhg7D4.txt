I'm putting you out of your misery
Cause darling you're dragging me down
I wish I could say that I'm sorry
But I'm over that, now I'm taking you out
It's a cruel, cruel world

I used to see beauty in people
But now I see muscle and bones
You know I never wanted to hurt you
But I'm sorry, my friend, this is the end

So I'm saying my goodbyes
Goodbye to my good side
It only ever got me hurt
And I finally learned
It's a cruel, cruel world
It's a cruel, cruel world

Erase you from my mind
I'm sorry, but I
I'm cutting all the ties

So I'm saying my goodbyes
Goodbye to my good side
It only ever got me hurt
And I finally learned
It's a cruel, cruel world
It's a cruel, cruel world
Cruel, cruel world
