I knew you were empty,
I knew you were lost yet still,
I'm alone,
But oh how I've grown

Thought that he'd left me,
Thought that he'd burned out bright,
And I'm alone,
But somehow I'm alright

It seemed so easy,
Just to walk, just to run,
But if you leave me,
I can re-aquaint myself, with my true loved one

(Chorus)
Just leave town
I can sleep when you're not around
Thought it was myself that I'd found

I knew you were empty,
I knew you were lost yet still,
I'm alone,
But oh how I've grown

Thought that he'd left me,
Thought that he'd burned out bright,
And I'm alone,
But somehow I'm alright

It seemed so easy,
Just to walk, just to run,
But if you leave me,
I can re-aquaint myself, with my true loved one

Just leave town
I can sleep when you're not around
Thought it was myself that I'd found
I said just leave town
I can sleep when you're not around
I gotta take another call right now
