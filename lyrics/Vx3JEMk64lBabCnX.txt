I never seen nobody ever live like you
We never leave the house without a drink or two
We're never going to work, we play all night and day
I never thought a life could ever be that way

Though the lights fade
It never went out
The life that we made
Will never wear out
Though the lights fade
It never went out
The life that we made
Will never wear out
Why you so sad?
Sex makes everything better, better
Why you so mad?
Sex makes everything better

You never seen the summers that you didn't like
I never been in paradise, who wasn't right
I wanted every arm the times I see right through
You made me drop a line the times I missed my cue

Though the lights fade
It never went out
The life that we made
Will never wear out
Though the lights fade
It never went out
The life that we made
Will never wear out
Why you so sad?
Sex makes everything better, better
Why you so mad?
Sex makes everything better
Why you so sad?
Sex makes everything better, better
Why you so mad?
Sex makes everything better

We got separate, join the aftermath
I'm following the path of destruction back
We have to leave because the people are asking us
Sit down because we're scaring the passengers
I've been exploring every avenue
I want shoes that given above to you
We need help, we're the dumb and the callers
Oh 800 good clean fun
Little bit of good clean fun
Living like a loaded gun
All we need is good clean fun, fun, yeah

Why you so sad?
Sex makes everything better, better
Why you so mad?
Sex makes everything better
Why you so sad?
Sex makes everything better, better
Why you so mad?
Sex makes everything better
