It's not the first time that we met
But the last time that we kissed

That's got you rushing through my head
And the feeling I won't miss

Cuz you're my girl
I love you and you love me too
(oh yes you do, oh yes you do)
Cuz you're my girl
I love you and you love me too
(oh yes you do oh yes you do)
Cuz you're my girl
I love you and you love me too
Oh yeah, I love you

You're constantly looking to me
But the mirror it reflects
When I don't know who I should be
I emulate your dialect

Cuz you're my girl
I love you and you love me too
(oh yes you do, oh yes you do)
Cuz you're my girl
I love you and you love me too
(oh yes you do oh yes you do)
Cuz you're my girl
I love you and you love me too
Oh yeah, I love you

It's not the last time that we kissed
But the first time that we met

I saw your image through the crack of the door
Immediately I plotted out a plan to be yours

She's the girl girl girl girl girl

Ran away from me
And to move brings me up
And relives my stress

Whenever you're around
I hate everything less
Don't let me see you blue

I'd lose my voice for you
And all the color schemes in this world
Don't have a thing on this girl
Cuz you're...
My girl, I love you and you love me too
(oh yes you do, oh yes you do)
Cuz you're my girl
I love you and you love me too
(oh yes you do, oh yes you do)
Cuz you're my girl
I love you and you love me too

Oh yeah, I love you
