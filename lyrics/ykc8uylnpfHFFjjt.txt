I'm on the highway, nobody knows
I am inoperable, out of commission
I'm lost on the highway and losing hope
I am a runaway child, I'm out of order

I can't help thinking he's dancing all alone
I'm hopelessly hoping he's lost on his own
Wherever he's gone that's where I'll go
And I'll commit murder to keep him warm

Ain't nobody got nothing but my wild heart
Ain't nobody got nothing but my wild heart
And I will bring my baby home

I'm in his doorway but he's not there
I try to whisper his name like a broken prayer
I'm at a payphone waiting on hold
I am a runaway child, I'm out of order

I can't help thinking he's dancing all alone
I can't help thinking he's dancing all alone
I'm hopelessly hoping he's lost on his own
I find myself wishing he'd just left me alone
Wherever he's gone that's where I'll go
And I'll commit murder to keep him warm

Ain't nobody got nothing but my wild heart
Ain't nobody got nothing but my wild heart
Ain't nobody got nothing but my wild heart
Ain't nobody got nothing but my wild heart
And I will bring my baby home

And nobody knows my name
And nobody knows my name
I am a runaway child
I'm out of order
