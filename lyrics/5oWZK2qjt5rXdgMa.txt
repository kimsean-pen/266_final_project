Another day, is going by
I'm thinkin' about you all the time
But you're out there
And I'm here waiting

And I, wrote this letter, in my head
Cuz' so many things were left unsaid
But now you're gone
And I can't think straight

This could be, the one last chance,
to make you understand, yeah

I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
Somehow I can't put you in the past
I'd do anything
Just to fall asleep with you
Will you remember me?
Cuz' I know I won't forget you

Together we, broke all the rules
Dreamin' of droppin' out of school
And leavin' this place
To never come back

So now, maybe after, all these years
And if you miss me have no fear
I'll be here
And I'll be waitin'

This could be, the one last chance, to make you understand
And I just can't let you leave me once again, yeah

I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
Somehow I can't put you in the past
I'd do anything
Just to fall asleep with you
Will you remember me?
Cuz' I know I won't forget you

I close my eyes
And all I see is you
I close my eyes
I try to sleep, I can't forget you
Nanana, nanana
And I'd do anything for you
Nanana, nanananaaaa

I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
Somehow I can't put you in the past
I'd do anything
Just to fall asleep with you
To fall asleep with you
With you, yeah

I'd do anything
To fall asleep with you
I'd do anything
There's nothing I won't do
I'd do anything
To fall asleep with you
I'd do anything
Cuz' I know, I won't forget you
