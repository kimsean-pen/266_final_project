All day long she's waiting for the night to ask her out
To be somebody's dancer, to get lost inside a crowd
There's no need to talk because the music is so loud
'Til a taxi drives her back into a morning full of doubt

You can feel like part of something if you're part of the scene
You can make your life look pretty, add a little ice and gin
Wash off the makeup and prepare the Aspirin
Oh, you can get out of this party dress but you can't get out of this, skin

His home is where his heart is at the parties that he roams
He tells himself he can't be lonely 'cause he's never on his own
But all the friends he makes tonight, in the morning, they are gone
And he's left with his four walls, his aching head, his silent phone

You can feel like part of something if you're part of the scene
You can make your life look pretty, add a little ice and gin
Wash off the makeup and prepare the Aspirin
Oh, you can get out of this party dress but you can't get out of this

Hearing your own echos in the empty staircase
And you're walking through your dark apartment looking for a friendly face
Because the Polaroid pictures on your fridge won't do
No, the Polaroid pictures on your fridge won't do
No, the Polaroid pictures on your fridge won't do
No, they won't do

You can feel like part of something if you're part of the scene
You can make your life look pretty, add a little ice and gin
Wash off the makeup and prepare the Aspirin
Oh, you can get out of this party dress but you can't get out of this

All day long she's waiting for the night to ask her out
To be somebody's dancer, just a puppet in the crowd
And how to move her feet is all she has to think about
'Til a taxi drives her back into a morning full of doubt

You can feel like part of something if you're part of the scene
You can make your life look pretty, add a little ice and gin
Wash off the makeup and prepare the Aspirin
Oh, you can get out of this party dress but you can't get out

Of feeling like part of something if you're part of the scene
You can make your life look pretty, add a little ice and gin
Wash off the makeup and prepare the Aspirin
Oh, you can get out of this party dress but you can't get out of this, skin
