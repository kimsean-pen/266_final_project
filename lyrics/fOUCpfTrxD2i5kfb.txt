My trip? It, it was kinda like a work thing
We didn't really have much time to see the sights
Or do anything really, so
I don't know, we pretty much stayed at the hotel

When I think of
(Oh, when I, when I)
When I think of
(When I)

When I
When I
Good night, Uh

You can't tell me I'm perfect fitted jeans
You can't tell me I'll bust it at the seams
You can't tell me like "You're right"
When I think of
The pinnacle like when I could compare
The Norcal in my system smell like new day
Like coming in I cannot find the restless
Expected

When I think of you, when I
(When I)
When I think of you, when I
(When I)
When I think of you, when I
(When I)
When I
When I think of you

You can't tell me, I'm a doctor at Duke
You can't tell me you're bucking up at news
I know you're coming to me calling
"When I think of"
I'm taking off, Holy- Wow, what a view
They let us circle Earth in magic tubes
They let us fly those tubes across the planet
I can't understand it

When I think of you, when I
When I think of you, when I
(When I)
When I think of you, when I
(When I)
When I, when I, when I, oh when I
(When I)
When I think of you
When I, when I, when I

(When I think of you)
Get out, good night
(When I)
Get out, good night
(When I)
Get out, good night
(When I think of)
Night, night
