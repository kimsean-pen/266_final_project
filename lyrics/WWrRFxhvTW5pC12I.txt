I was denied entry to the garden
Retrieve me some dignity oh please (My darlin')
I beg your pardon
What's the problem?
Are we starting to hit rock bottom?

There's an elephant in the room and I don't know how to make it move
All day long it just sits and waits to disapprove
What could go wrong with a head full of cotton
Write it all down before it's all forgotten

I played my last hand but surely I can make it withstand
I played my last hand but surely I can make it withstand

Withstand, give it a chance
Withstand, give it a chance
Withstand, give it a chance
Withstand, give it another chance

Find clarity to unlock the truth, refused
Where do we seem to hit walls, when we conclude
I beg your pardon
What's the problem?
Are we starting to hit rock bottom?

There's an elephant in the room and I don't know how to make it move
All day long it just sits and waits to disapprove
I'm scouring for a substitute discussion
Call it what you want, but don't call it nothing

I played my last hand but surely I can make it withstand
I played my last hand but surely I can make it withstand

Withstand, give it a chance
Withstand, give it a chance
Withstand, give it a chance
Withstand, give it another chance
