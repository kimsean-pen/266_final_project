Now I don't think you're wondering what I've been up to
I'm trying not to rush to the show
I've been trying real hard
To slow down this one time
'Cause time has been feeling
So precious in my changing mind

And how I wish there was something I could find
To hate about you
To disqualify what I'm feeling
But I don't know you well enough
To know an ugly side
And it's looking like I probably never will

'Cause you're at a standstill
And I refuse to run around you
So I'll run circles in my head
And I'll bring people to my bed
Who I don't really like, to distract myself

Your slightly crooked eyes just made me like you more
I want to see them contort with all the feelings
You said you want to feel but aren't feeling
It's beautiful, you want to know the full range of being
But for me, that's very real and it's what I'm running from

And how I wish there was something I could find
To hate about you
To disqualify what I'm feeling
But I don't know you well enough
To know an ugly side
And it's looking like I probably never will

'Cause you're at a standstill
And I refuse to run around you
So I'll run circles in my head
And I'll bring people to my bed
Who I don't really like, to distract myself
But that's not helping me this time
