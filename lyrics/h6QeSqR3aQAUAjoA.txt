We've been waiting, anticipating change coming our way
You're my baby through the bad lights to the greater days

I know that something good is waiting just around the corner
There's a new day dawning, there's a new life for us
Got to keep on holding on for just a little longer I know

That it's gonna be blue skies for you and I
We'll step out of the shadows and walk into the light
Yeah it's gonna be blue skies for you and I
But my heart beats slow as the storm carries on up high
And the clouds roll by

I can feel it, it's a comet, fast and fierce and wild
I can see it everytime I look into those eyes

Tell me is it really gonna storm again
Will the sky turn dark, will the rain begin?
I wanna be with you wherever lightning strikes cause I know
That it's gonna be blue skies for you and I
We'll step out of the shadows and walk into the light
