Sometimes I lay
Under the moon
And thank God I'm breathing
And then I pray
Don't take me soon
I am here for a reason

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around 'cause

All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more
There'll be no more war
And our children will play

One day
One day
One day
One day
One day
One day

It's not about
Win or lose
We all lose
When they feed on the souls of the innocent
Blood-drenched pavement
Keep on moving though the waters stay raging

And in this maze you can lose your way
Your way
It might drive you crazy but don't let it faze you, no way
Said no way

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around 'cause

All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more
There'll be no more war
And our children will play

One day
One day
One day
One day
One day
One day

One day this all will change
Treat the people all the same
One day
One day

One day this all will change
Treat the people all the same
One day

One day this all will change
Treat people the same
Stop with the violence, down with the hate
One day we'll all be free
And proud to be
Under the same sun
Singing songs of freedom like

, oh
, oh

All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more
There'll be no more war
And our children will play

One day
One day
One day
Oh, one day
One day
One day

Oh, one day
One day
One day, oh

(Austin, Texas, thanks a lot y'all)
