Sigh to me so willingly, so willingly.
And you can wait to participate,
Oh, just take.

Sing your story. Sing your story.
Sing your story. Sing your story.

I'm breathing on your waiting song
Oh, your song
And speak in part. Oh, let me start
Oh, I start

Give your story, give your story
Give your story, give your story
away

And when you sing, oh fire. You dream
I'm already. I was all ready.
And when you kiss, you will stand on this
I was first
