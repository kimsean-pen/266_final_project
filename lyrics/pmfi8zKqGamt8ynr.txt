I'm searcing for a getaway, a better day
But where are all the people, I cannot stay
In this awful place a minute longer
Hey bird is this is the way?
This labyrinth is messing with my head
Hey don't fly away!
There a little gate
Goodbye, bye muddy hole!

I'll dance the night away
Swaying like the hay
In the wind of change!
I'm moving to the beat
Surrendering to heat
The moment's holding on!

Who are these little men with little hacks
Who dance around the fireplace?
A funny play on this awful day, maybe they can
Help me to find a way to flee this place
A slinky pile of dirt and the muddy caves
And the little men
Goodbye, bye muddy hole!

I'll dance the night away
Swaying like the hay
In the wind of change!
I'm moving to the beat
Surrendering to heat
The moment's holding on!

I'll dance the night away
Feel the rhythm in my veins!
I'm dancing on the stars, moon
I hold you in my arms!
Aaah!
