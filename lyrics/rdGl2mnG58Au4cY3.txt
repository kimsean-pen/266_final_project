She's white as a clover
Imagining in her thoughts
Rehearsing the places
Where you always waited
And wondered if we had to belong

If no one can hear you
You're not too young to cry
This emptiness swallowed us
And let yourself get past
And fall into this ocean of time

Cause even if your dream is failing
Or feeling like you'll never sleep again
There's no one else that's more worth chasing
Although we'll only meet now and again
Whatever makes your heart beat faster
Whatever gives you trouble through the night
I won't forget the time we had when you came back
And left your ruins all behind

What if there are changes?
What if you're not the same?
You're meeting the different
You're losing your spirit
You don't know all the words you should say
Those dams are behind us
There's nothing else to do
You throw out the memories
That keep you remembering
For you to go and start something new

Cause even if your dream is failing
Or feeling like you'll never sleep again
There's nothing else that's more worth chasing
Although we'll only meet now and again
Whatever makes your heart beat faster
Whatever gives you trouble through the night
I won't forget the time we had when you came back
And left your ruins all behind

If no one can hear you
You're not too young to cry
This emptiness swallowed us
And let yourself get past
And fall into this ocean of time
