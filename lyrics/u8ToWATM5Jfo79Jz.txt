I still see us sitting on that old couch
'Til the sun comes up
Listening to sad songs
We spent our time with smiles on our faces
I know it sounds selfish but I'll miss those days
I know it sounds selfish

Honestly, as time goes on
Time becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall across my mind

The Fall leaves flying through the driveway
Keep triggering these memories of you
I'm torn apart with how our lives are changing
I'm sure it sounds selfish, I'm just being honest
I know it sounds selfish
But I'm trying to be honest

Honestly, as time goes on
Time becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall across my mind

Let's go back to when thing weren't complicated
Let's go back to all those old dashboard songs
Let's go back to smoking on the side of my old house
We can never go back, we'll never go back
We'll never go back

Honestly, as time goes on
Time becomes a fence that I can't climb
But as I start to feel that change
It all becomes a wall across my mind
I know it sounds selfish
I'm just being honest
