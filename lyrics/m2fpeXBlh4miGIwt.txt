Someone has taken your heart
Just to leave it alone
Like a feather you fall
But the wind is too hard
Ahh ahh
Let the noise run through your head
Ahh ahh
Leave my voice there, let your feelings echo
Ahh ahh
Let the noise run through your head
Ahh ahh
Leave my voice there, let your feelings echo

Someone has taken your heart
Too far from home
Like a raven she goes
Hunting keys with Jane Doe
Let the noise run through your head [x7]
Ahh ahh
Let the noise run through your head
Ahh ahh
Leave my voice there, let your feelings echo
Ahh ahh
Let the noise run through your head
Ahh ahh
Leave my voice there, let your feelings echo
