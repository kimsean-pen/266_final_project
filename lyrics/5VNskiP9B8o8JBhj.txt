You sure you really wanna do this
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that

It's been doing some thinking
And felt fair that she should know
All actions in which partake
Are far beyond it's control

Whether it was born or bred
Genetic environment
I wouldn't bother to ask it why
Simply concentrate on when, when

Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that

It lies awake, yes, quite obsessed
Making plans but it won't tell
So longs to hear her final words
I brought this on myself

The theory of futility
Now you'll learn, so be prepared
Enemies are equal to
Wrath times the speed of fright squared

Yeah, if you don't kill me
I'm going to have to kill you, you
If you don't kill me
I'm going to have to kill you, you

My God helps those who help themselves
Of thus, she shan't be ashamed
Crawl into line and wait your turn
Remember Jesus slaves

Department of probation
Legally it can't be blamed
Held therefore unaccountable
Since it's clinically insane
What a shame again

If you don't kill me
I'm going to have to kill you, you
If you don't kill me
I'm going to have to kill you, you

If you don't kill me, me
I'm going to have to kill you, you
If you don't kill me, me
I'm going to have to kill you, you, you, yeah

You must decide we're out of time
No place to hide your choice not mine
You must decide we're out of time
No place to hide your choice not mine

You must decide we're out of time
No place to hide your choice not mine
You must decide we're out of time
No place to hide your choice not mine
