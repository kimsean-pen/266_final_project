I think I think too much
I think we know to much
Everytime I'm pushing for some little ride in
I'm in a photograph, lost it from people's past
I'm looking out and they just stare right in

I've been looking for a moment to say that
But I just stand up with nothing

Give me a reason to let you go
Cause I am drowning in your shallow love
Give me a reason, won't you let me know?
This heart of mine is sinking like a stone
Shallow love, let me go
Shallow love, let me go

I try to wonder of
I think of sudden love
Don't you think it's time or you could take your turn?
Maybe I'm wasting time
My motions are paralized
I don't even hear when you are crying out loud

I'm always waiting for someone to start a fire
But I just stand up with nothing

Give me a reason to let you go
Cause I am drowning in your shallow love
Give me a reason, won't you let me know?
This heart of mine is sinking like a stone
Shallow love, let me go
Shallow love, let me go
Shallow love, let me go
Shallow love, let me go

I never felt wanted
I never felt needed
Give me a reason to follow, follow
I'm starting running to you
I'm tired of asking again and again, again and again

Give me a reason to let you go
Cause I am drowning in your shallow love
Give me a reason to let you go
Cause I am drowning in your shallow love
Give me a reason, won't you let me know?
This heart of mine is sinking like a stone
Shallow love, let me go
Shallow love, let me go
Shallow love, let me go
Shallow love, let me go
