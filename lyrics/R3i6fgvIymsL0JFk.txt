Choking on air
Something's making me breathe
All these memories I had
They are taking them from me

There's something inside of me
This is my time again
This is the right time
But I get there's something within

Something's crawling underneath my skin, I fear
Something's dying right deep within
Something's crawling underneath my skin, I fear
Something's dying, I will not give in

Locked in my head
While my sins are on display
Every time that I atone
They come back attacking me

There's something inside of me
This is my time again
This is the right time
But I get there's something within

Something's crawling underneath my skin, I fear
Something's dying right deep within
Something's crawling underneath my skin, I fear
Something's dying, I will not give in

We search to find a place inside
Define the urge to die, to live again
It's time to kill this thing that thrives inside

Something's crawling underneath my skin, I fear
Something's dying right deep within
Something's crawling underneath my skin, I fear
Something's dying, I will not give in

I will not give in
I will not give in
