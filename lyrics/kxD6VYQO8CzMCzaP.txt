It's daylight, i'm alive
Need Pedialyte or something with electrolytes
Where's my phone?
How did I get home?
Who's wig is this?

Up and go
Stuff to do
I ran a day to waste, so many mistakes to make
But I won't
Get high til tonight (or evening, evening yeah)

I promise myself that i'm gonna behave
And I'm thinking about all the money that i'll save (Coinstar b*tch)
Maybe go on a hike and start with a clean slate
But f*ck my drag

Been sober since the after hours
But what I found tests my willpower
Wasn't lookin' for drugs til I found them
Ooh na-na ayy
For drugs til I found them (yeah)

Addiction is not my thing
I'm just a party kid, pack the bowl and snort this sh*t
Where's my keys?
Oh f*ck I might let you use my nail

I'm wreckin' my life i'm a total disgrace (hot mess)
My tongue is all [?] with a strange aftertaste
Then turn inside out so there's nothing to waste
Don't make that face (Only Jod can Gudge me)

Been sober since the after hours
But what I found tests my willpower
Wasn't lookin' for drugs til I found them (light em up)
Ooh na-na ayy
For drugs til I found them (yeah)
I knew that I misplaced that baggy
And lookin' I just found this fatty
I wasn't lookin' for drugs til I found them
Ooh na-na ayy
For drugs til I found them (oh)

Disclaimer
Drugs are real bad if you're not legal age
Don't mix g and booze unless you wanna get saved (it's science)
A little K with some coke and MDMA
But crack is whack

Been sober since the after hours
But what I found tests my willpower
Wasn't lookin' for drugs til I found them
Ooh na-na ayy
For drugs til I found them yeah
I knew that I misplaced that baggy
And lookin' for I just found this fatty
I wasn't lookin' drugs until I found them
Ooh na-na ayy
For drugs til I found them ooh

Wasn't lookin' for drugs til I found them
Ooh na-na ayy
For drugs til I found them ooh
