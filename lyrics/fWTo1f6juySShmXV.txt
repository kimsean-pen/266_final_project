Seems like a million times
Seems like I had your touch

Seems so good to see the good king
How long has it been
It seems like a very long time
Now baby you, seems like a mighty long time

Oh, my my my soul so glad
He's popped by to say hello to me
Let me put that just where it used to be
It seems like a mighty long time
Now baby you, seems like a mighty long time

Oh, oh, yes I'm so glad you're here again
Oh if you're not gonna stay
Please ...like you did before
Because I still love you so
It seems like a mighty long time
Now baby you, seems like a mighty long time
It seems like a mighty long time
It seems like a mighty long time

Oh, my my my, I'm so over you
