Standing in heaven
But don't feel the light
The brighest colors are the black and white
You wanna dance but you don't trust your feet
You know the rhythm but can't feel the beat

The night, the night, the night is full of tears
You cry, you cry, you cry
When you feel everything's impossible
Just know you're gonna be

Fine
You're gonna be fine
You don't have to worry
Don't you turn that from
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun

Fine
You're gonna be fine
Just don't be a player, right
Take the calm
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun

Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun

Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun

You got it all
But you don't feel complete
Even the sweetest things are bittersweet
You're riding high
But you just fear the fall
Don't even recognize yourself at all

The night, the night, the night is full of tears
You cry, you cry, you cry
When you feel everything's impossible
Just know you're gonna be

Fine
You're gonna be fine
You don't have to worry
Don't you turn that from
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun

Fine
You're gonna be fine
Just don't be a player, right
Take the calm
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun

Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun

Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
