I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me on
my birthday deathbed
I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me
'cause I'm dead & bloated

I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me on
my birthday deathbed
I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me
'cause I'm dead & bloated

Ohhh Yeah, and she says it's
natural
I feel I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run

Ohh Yeah, and she says it's
natural
I feel I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run

You can't swallow what I'm
thinkin'

You can't swallow what I'm
thinkin'

I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me on
my birthday deathbed
I am trampled under sole of
another man's shoes
Guess I walked too softly

Oh Yeah, and she says it's
natural
I feel I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run

Oh Yeah, and she says it's
natural
I feel I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run

You can't swallow what I'm
thinkin'

You can't swallow what I'm
thinkin'

I run through the world
thinking about tomorrow
Thinking about tomorrow

I run through the world
thinking about tomorrow
Thinking about tomorrow

I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me on
my birthday deathbed
I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me
'cause I'm dead & bloated

I run through the world
thinking about tomorrow
Thinking about tomorrow

I run through the world
thinking about tomorrow
Thinking about tomorrow
I run through the world
thinking about tomorrow
Thinking about tomorrow
I run through the world
thinking about tomorrow
Thinking about tomorrow
I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me on
my birthday deathbed
I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me
somebody gave me
somebody gave me
on my birthday deathbed
