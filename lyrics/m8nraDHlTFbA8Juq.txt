Check your ballot and vote this dick, right?
You gotta eat, right?
You gotta eat, right?
I'm not looking down and then looking away
I'mma cook a brat like I cook a filet
Nobody out here has been talking to Dave
Will ain't even liking what you had to say

Do you even love her?
Do you even love her?
That's your own mother!
Bloodsucker

Somehow you can be somehow
What a waste of paradise
Sucking life

You've become predictable
Way you play is typical
Settled in the victim's role
You flourish in the pain

I figure that was another ass hard ass part
My coke's inside this bloodied rag
I'm in a stat's class smoking backpack pie chart
With a grove of muddy greaser bees

Check your ballot and vote this dick, right?
You gotta eat, right?
You gotta eat, right?

Do you even love her?
Do you even love her?
That's your own mother!
Bloodsucker

You've become predictable
Way you play is typical
Settled in the victim's role
You flourish in the pain

Way you play is typical
Settled in the victim's role
You flourish in the pain

Face facts, you'd love to be attacked
The retroactive pieces fit to match all your embellishments
Settled in the victim's role
You flourish in the pain

I will watch you suffer like a good consumer should
Popcorn in my belly tells me you're misunderstood
Wait, I feel nothing
Am I becoming
Desensitized to virtue touting?
Judgments they're scowling
Pigeons they're howling
Nobody stops to listen

You gotta be on alcohol
To hang out in a shopping mall
There's nothing left to buy that isn't cheaper online

The only reason I'm alive is
Waiting for the A.I. to do some tight shit
And lemme suck its fucking dick
She like it puffy, comfy and lumpy
Make your ass a frumpy dumpy bro

You've become predictable
Way you play is typical
Settled in the victim's role
You flourish in the pain

Face facts, you'd love to be attacked
The retroactive pieces fit to match all your embellishments
Settled in the victim's role
You flourish in the pain

Can't take it back
Accusations, fact
Denial becomes evidence to crucify the innocent
Settled in the victim's role
He'll anguish in the pain
