Tell me that I'm still breathing
Tell me that I'm not fading now
I'm not fading out

Tell me that I'm not crazy
Help me to make sense of it all
To make sense of it all

So wash it all away
And move it like a storm
The ocean's overflowing now
You bring to life all that is broken
You can turn the tide before it's too late
'Cause I'm not afraid of anything
When You burn like a fire inside
You bring to life

Show me hope for healing
Show me signs of who You are
I want to see Your heart

You bring to life

You bring to life all that is broken
You can turn the tide before it's too late
'Cause I'm not afraid of anything
When You burn like a fire inside
You bring to life

You burn like a fire inside
(You bring to life)
The ocean's overflowing now
I'm not afraid of anything
When You burn like a fire inside
You bring to life
