As I walk on
Through this wicked world
Searching for light in the darkness of insanity
I ask myself
Is all hope lost
Is there only pain and hatred and misery

And each time I feel like this inside
There's one thing I wanna know
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding

As I walk on
Through troubled times
My spirit gets so down-hearted sometimes
So where are the strong
And who are the trusted
And where is the harmony, sweet harmony

'Cause each time I feel it slipping away
Just makes me wanna cry
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding

So where are the strong
And who are the trusted
And where is the harmony, sweet harmony

'Cause each time I feel it slipping away
Just makes me wanna cry
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding
