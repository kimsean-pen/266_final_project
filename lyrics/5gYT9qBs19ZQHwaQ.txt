Holding on, yeah
Always so sweet
Darling I can't help but believe
What I can't even see

Always looking for me
And I should probably be seeing that there's nothing
But I just want something
Cause I hold onto nothing
And try to hope that there will be

I can't help but wonder
What's the point?
There's no god in my sky
And surely I could do what I like

But still the structure breaking at the joints
I forgot, what was the point?
Now I will never know

I can't help but wonder, what's the point?
Now I will never know

Holding on, yeah
Always so sweet
Darling I can't help but believe
What I can't even see

Always looking for me
And I should probably be seeing
There's nothing but I just want something
Because I hold onto nothing
Since I hope there will be

There will be rain that pours
From the eyes of the one I adore
I hate that
So I stay laid back
'Cause I know in love
I know I could never fake that
None of you gonna take that
Away from me
