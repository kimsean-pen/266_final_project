My baby said he loved me
My baby said he need me
Gonna eat, sleep and breathe me out
'Til the end (yeah)
But then my baby went bad (went bad)
I guess he had a relapse (yeah)
Had to sneak, cheat and bring me down
It had to end (end, yeah)

My baby falls asleep in his bed (bed)
Fingertips (tips) on the edge
He left me for a girl
But he regrets leaving me

And I hope it hurts like hell (oh-oh-oh)
And I hope it hurts like hell (oh-oh-oh)

You should have never let me go
I know I'm messing up your mind
The devil got you good this time
And I hope it hurts like hell (oh-oh-oh)
My baby said he loved me (yeah, I do)
My baby had it easy (yeah)
Got to touch, kiss and please me
All night and day (day, yeah)

Remember when we took that trip to Cabo?
Twenty-four hours, then we took it to the chateau
How does it feel to do it on your own?
Missing me (yeah, yeah)

My baby's all alone in his bed
Fingertips on the edge
He left me for a girl
But he regrets leaving me

And I hope it hurts like hell (oh-oh-oh)
And I hope it hurts like hell (oh-oh-oh)

You shoulda never let me go
I know I'm messing up your mind
The devil got you good this time
And I hope it hurts like hell (oh-oh-oh)
(I really hope it hurts like hell)
I really hope it hurts like
Like, like hell (hell)
I really hope it hurts like (oh)
Like (hell), like hell (hell)
I really hope it hurts like (oh)
Like (hell), like hell (hell)
I really hope it hurts like (oh)
Like (hell), like hell
