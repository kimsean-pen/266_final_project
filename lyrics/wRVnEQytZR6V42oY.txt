Cars crash through the streets
The west end waves break city heat
The east coast storms fill in the sky
Winter weekends
Cold, unbearable
Life, so terrible
Shots ring out in blind
Stellar night time
Town lights come alive like a land mine
Eyes wide up in five second intervals
Unpredictable, life's a miracle
We all are love and love is hard
We're hard to love
We all are love and love is hard
It breaks my heart
We all are love and love is hard
We're hard to love
We all are love and love is hard
So here's my heart
I can't close my eyes
The east end barrels
It's summer time
The west coast lives got butterflies
So literal
Cold, unbearable
Life, so terrible
Kids live fearlessly
And curious lives grow up to be
So serious
Lost time, broken dreams
So usual
Unpredictable, life's a miracle
We all are love and love is hard
We're hard to love
We all are love and love is hard
It breaks my heart
We all are love and love is hard
We're hard to love
We all are love and love is hard
So here's my heart
It's only the cycle
It's deafening love
This age old recital is king of all sounds
There is no release, free, we're silently numb
A slow rolling wave with a wake that's yet to come
