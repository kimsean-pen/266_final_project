you have a mythological beauty
you have the eye of someone i have seen
outside of ordinary situations
even outside of dreams
you lie in bed at night and watch the lines of headlights through your screen
there is a child inside you who is trying
to raise the child in me
if you wanna leave
you just have to say
you're all caught up inside
but you know the way
you cut the flesh of your left thumb
using your boyfriend's knife
seventeen you took his come
and you gave birth to your first life
you gave andrew a family who
you thought could love and take better care
i have an older brother i don't know
he could be anywhere
if you wanna leave
you just have to say
you're all caught up inside
but you know the way
you're all caught up inside
but you know the way
rented a house in niswah, minnesota,
shrapnel, and oil cans, rhubarb in the yard
i built a ladder out of metal pieces
father was working hard
standing beneath the oak tree by the front door
you were inside baking bread
sister came out and put her arms around me
blood gushing from my head
you held me in the backseat with a dishrag
soaking up blood with your eye
I was just 5 and you were 27 praying don't let my baby die
if you wanna leave
you just have to say
you're all caught up inside
but you know the way
you're all caught up inside
but you know the way
so much more
to live your life
to walk the floor
to say goodnight
to leave your light on
do you leave you light on?
you're all caught up inside
but you know the way
