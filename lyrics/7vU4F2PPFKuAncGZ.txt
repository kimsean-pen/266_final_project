More than you know, more than you know
When the river shallows, I always go
Back to the moment I feel the most
I'll carry this upon my back always.
If you fall, I will put you back, I do
Love you, but it's just a fact
The history of a cheating heart is always more than you know!

More than you know, more than you know
When the white flag is over, I always go
Back to the moment I feel the most.
I'll carry this upon my back always.
If you fall, I will put you back, I do
Love you, but it's just a fact
The history of a cheating heart is always more than you know!

More than you know I am besides you
Under the tangelo tree I grow.
With my consort of forever
The history of my humble show
It's more than you know!
