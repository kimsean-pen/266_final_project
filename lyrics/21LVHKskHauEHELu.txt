G Train on the weekend
Speed up or slow down
Gathering, gathering get off this train
No you're gonna go back uptown.
G Train on the weekend
There's no way out
I'm travelling, travelling it's 2 AM
And I thought I'd be home by now

What am I doing this for?
I followed you to your door
I should've already known
To get gone on home

Love I got to warn you
I'm starting to catch on to
What you make me go through
(Get going or I'm gone)
I've been losing patience
Your mind is always changing
Back and forth I'm waiting
(Get going or I'm gone forever)

G Train on the weekend
Humming real low
A lullaby for the guy who fell down nearby
'Cause he did a bit too much blow
G Train on the weekend
Just me in my head
Wondering why you denying my love when I
Keep on running back to your side

What am I doing this for?
I followed you to your door
I should've already known
to get gone on home
You told me don't take it too fast
'Cause you got an ugly past
I think I could help but you don't
Guess get gone on home

Love I got to warn you
I'm starting to catch on to
What you make me go through
(Get going or I'm gone)
I've been losing patience
Your mind is always changing
Back and forth I'm waiting
(Get going or I'm gone forever)

I won't
I won't wait here
I won't wait here for you

I won't
I won't wait here
I won't wait here for you to get on board

Love I got to warn you
I'm starting to catch on to
What you make me go through
(Get going or I'm gone)
I've been losing patience
Your mind is always changing
Back and forth I'm waiting
(Get going or I'm gone)
Love I got to warn you
I'm starting to catch on to
What you make me go through
(Get going or I'm gone)
I've been losing patience
Your mind is always changing
Back and forth I'm waiting
(Get going or I'm gone forever)
Hoppin' on the G Train
In and out of Brooklyn
Come and let my love in
I could take you places
