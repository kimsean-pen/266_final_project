Oh, I didn't mean to yell
But sometimes I get beside myself
And oh, I didn't mean to rush you
But time keeps pushing so much
Oh, time keeps pushing so much

Your eyes stare at me in the dark
And I hope those eyes
Don't steal my freedom
My freedom

Oh, If I didn't give it all
When I stood you made me crawl
And oh, if you never heard the song
Then I could still hide down behind the wall
Then I could still hide down behind the wall

Your eyes stare at me in the dark
And I hope those eyes
Don't steal my freedom
My freedom

And I hope those eyes
Don't steal my freedom
My freedom
Said eyes, fallow me
I still believe there's something left for you me, for you me

Your eyes stare at me in the dark
And I hope those eyes
Don't steal my freedom
My freedom
Oh, my freedom

Your eyes stare at me in the dark
And I hope those eyes
Don't steal my freedom
My freedom
Oh, my freedom
Said eyes, those eyes
Said eyes, those eyes
I said don't steal my freedom
