(Omnipotent, omnipotent)

You are our secret
It's worth keeping
And now I'm keeping my mouth shut
On the weekends
I won't hang out with anybody else
The pavement
Always baking
What's it want from me?
And I keep falling backwards
Looking for relief
Want to be free

I've been counting all the minutes
And the days have been counting me

I want to live my life again
But you won't
I'll never understand the waves
But you do
I didn't know I was afraid
But you do
I want to do it again

Well I've been sleeping
Waiting for something
But to feel nothing
At all, avoid the call
Sometimes I'm reckless
Sometimes misdirected
Sometimes when I'm tested
I tend to do nothing at all

When I'm alone
There's a ghost that keeps talking
And I know there's gotta be more
For sure

I want to live my life again
But you won't
I'll never understand the wind
But you do
I didn't know I was afraid
But you do
I want to do it again

Omnipotent (omnipotent)
I've been numbing my thoughts for hours
I know you wanted to save me from myself
We've been wilting and young for seeds
And I can't compete
Until I'm strung to the field
What's real?

I want to live my life again
But you won't
I'll never understand the wind
But you do
I didn't know I was afraid
But you do
I want to do it again

Do you want to live forever?
Do you want to live forever?
I would
