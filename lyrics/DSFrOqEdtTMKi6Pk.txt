Dying to live, living to die
Ain't no hellos here, nothing but goodbyes
It's like singing a song that cannot be sung
It's like having to end, child,
what's yet to have begun
Hey, hey, hey now
Where I am at times I just can't tell
Hey, hey, hey, now
I'm lost somewhere Between Heaven and Hell
All that you know and all that you knew
In the end, child, tell me what's it all mean to you
Don't forget just who and where you are --
You can spread your wings son
But don't you spread yourself too far, yeah
Hey, hey, hey now
Where I am at times I just can't tell
Hey, hey, hey, now
I'm lost somewhere Between Heaven and Hell

Somewhere

Hey, hey, hey now
Where I am at times I just can't tell
Hey, hey, hey, now I belong somewhere between heaven and hell
