In the car, windows down
Drove just to hear the sound
In my head, what I found
Is all too familiar now

And I'm losing sleep love
Over all these simple things

Still I'm holding on to your old sweatshirt
The black one with the cigarette burns
It smells like your perfume
There's always a part of me thats holding on to your
Deep green eyes and how they looked at mine
Polaroids of all those summer nights
Do you think of me too?
There's always a part of me that's holding on to you

In my sight, out of reach
Close enough to hear you breathe

Feel the rush over me
With every single word you speak

And I'm losing sleep love
Over all these simple things still I'm

Holding on to your old sweatshirt
The black one with the cigarette burns
It smells like your perfume
There's always a part of me thats holding on to your
Deep green eyes and how they looked at mine
Polaroids of all those summer nights
Do you think of me too?
There's always a part of me that's holding on to you
