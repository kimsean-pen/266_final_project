Everyone is ready for their outline
Everyone is ready for their call
Maybe I, maybe I've been selfish for these sounds
Finally I'm ready for the silence
Finally I'm out of this cloud
Maybe I, maybe I've been selfish all along

I guess you should know that
That I don't need you there
But I need you sometimes
But not all the time, no
I need you there
I need you there

So you're waiting on the coastline
Waiting for the right sign
Waiting for the opportunity to hit you right
So put me in a line
Add another line
Soon you'll have a box
And you can put me inside
Put me in a box, boy
Put me in a box
Put me in a box and call me anything you want, boy
Put me in a line, boy
Put me in a line
Put me in a morning and put my feelings into life
Put me in a box, boy
Put me in a box
Put me in a box and call me anything you want, boy
Put me in a line, boy
Put me in a line
Put me in a morning and put my feelings into life

And anything goes
Anything you want
And anything goes
Anything you want, you want, you want, you want

Everyone is ready for their outline
Everyone is ready for their call
Maybe I, maybe I've been selfish all along
Finally I'm ready for the silence
Finally I'm ready for nothing
Maybe I, maybe I've been selfish
Maybe I, maybe I've been selfless
Maybe I, maybe I've been worthless
Maybe I, maybe I've been worth it
Maybe I, maybe I've been worth it
Maybe I, maybe I've been worth it
Maybe I, maybe I've been worth it
