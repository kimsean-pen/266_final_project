Back in the day when I lied
We'd always fight.
Now here you are foolin' 'round
Out every night.

I don't have to take it anymore
And I'm tired of always keeping score
All I'm saying
Do I look worried to you?
Oh, do I look worried?

Smacked in the face, such a disgrace
You were wrong
I try it again, stay 'till the end,
But how long?

We've been here so many times
And I know you've spent me so many lies
All I'm saying
Do I look worried to you?
Oh, do I look worried?
Ohh, worried to you
Ohh, 'cause I ain't worried.

Fool me once or twice, you know they say:
Shame on you!
Now that I'm done with the math
Here's what I'll do

I find my way to an open door
'Cause not the same as it was before
All I'm saying
Do I look worried to you?
Oh, do I look worried?
Ohh, worried
Ohh, 'cause ain't worried
Lord, 'cause I ain't worried
You better, you better be worried
Ohh, I'm worried, worried, worried, worried, worried, worried

Yeah I ain't gonna take it
Anymore
Ohhh!
