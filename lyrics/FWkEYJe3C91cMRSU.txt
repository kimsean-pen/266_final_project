Don't go to bed yet, love
I think it's too early
& we just need
A little time to ourselves

If my wall clock tells me that it's 4
In the morning, I'll give it hell
'Cause I've been trying way too long
To try & be the perfect song

When our hearts are heavy burdens
We shouldn't have to bear alone
So goodnight moon & goodnight you
When you're all that I think about

All that I dream about
How'd I ever breathe without
A goodnight kiss from goodnight you
The kind of hope they all talk about
The kind of feeling we sing about

Sit in our bedroom & read aloud
Like a passage from "Goodnight Moon"
& sing for me softly, love
Your song for tomorrow

& tell me my name's the one
That's hidden in there somewhere
& dream for me anything
But dream it in color

About we know the sun's still rising
& we don't care
'Cause I've been trying way too long
To try & be the perfect song

When our hearts are heavy burdens
We shouldn't have to bear alone
So goodnight you & goodnight moon
When you're all that I think about

All that I dream about
How'd I ever breathe without
A goodnight kiss from goodnight you
The kind of hope they all talk about
The kind of feelings we sing about
Sit in our bedrooms & read aloud

Like a passage from "Goodnight Moon"
From "Goodnight Moon"
& there you were
& I saw my Juliet come graceful down the stairs

It's hard to miss
The way her eyes light up the room
& steal the air

Just feel her lips
Lock onto every breath I take
& breathe it in
Do you feel us falling?

'Cause I feel us falling
So goodnight you & goodnight moon
When you're all that I think about
All that I dream about
How'd I ever breathe without
A goodnight kiss from goodnight you
The kind of hope they all talk about
The kind of feeling we sing about
Sit in our bedrooms & read aloud
Like a passage from "Goodnight Moon," oh
Oh, "Goodnight Moon," woah, woah
& there you were
& I saw my Juliet come graceful down the stairs
It's hard to miss
The way her eyes light up the room
& steal the air
Do you feel us falling?
'Cause I can feel us falling
Do you feel us falling?
'Cause I can feel us falling
Do you feel us falling?
'Cause I can feel us falling
Do you feel us falling?
'Cause I can feel us falling
Do you feel us falling?
'Cause I can feel us falling
Do you feel us falling?
'Cause I can feel us falling
