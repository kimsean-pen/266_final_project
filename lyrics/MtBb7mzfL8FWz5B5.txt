I tend to change my hair too much
It has become my ruination
My friend she keeps on warning much
For financial decapitation
On top of that it's true i see
People never recognize me
On top of that she's right i see
Ain't got no style, i'm nobody
I'm nobody, I'm nobody
I'm nobo-I'm-I'm nobody
I'm nobo-I'm-I'm-I'm nobody
I'm-I'm nobody, I'm nobody
I'm nobo, I'm nobody, I'm-I'm nobody
I know i shouldn't do it but
I love synthetic wigs a lot
I know i shouldn't do it but
I love synthetic wigs a lot

Every week a different do
Alter ego, who is who
And every single Euro too
Riches to rags, a bitches brew
Now I could teach a drag or two
I woke up like this, 'cause all you need is glue
Ratchet on my morning tomb
Ain't got no style, I'm nobody
I'm nobody, I'm nobody
No home, no phone, no car, no bed
No home, no phone, no car, no bed
No home, no phone, no car, no bed
But sometimes i'm Judy, Penelope (No home, no phone, no car, no bed)
Or Sandy on a sunday (No home)
Cassandra on a monday(No car, no bed)
Matongé is my home stay
I know i shouldn't do it but
I love synthetic wigs a lot
I know i shouldn't do it but
I love synthetic wigs a lot
