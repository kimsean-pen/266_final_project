There is love in your body but you can't hold it in
It pours from your eyes and spills from your skin
Tenderest touch leaves the darkest of marks
And the kindest of kisses break the hardest of hearts

The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts

There is love in your body but you can't get it out
It gets stuck in your head, won't come out of your mouth
Sticks to your tongue and shows on your face
That the sweetest of words have the bitterest taste

Darling heart, I loved you from the start
But you'll never know what a fool I've been
Darling heart, I loved you from the start
But that's no excuse for the state I'm in

The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts

There is love in our bodies and it holds us together
But pulls us apart when we're holding each other
We all want something to hold in the night
We don't care if it hurts when we're holding too tight

There is love in your body but you can't get it out
It gets stuck in your head, won't come out of your mouth
Sticks to your tongue and shows on your face
That the sweetest of words have the bitterest taste

Darling heart, I loved you from the start
But you'll never know what a fool I've been
Darling heart, I loved you from the start
But that's no excuse for the state I'm in

The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts

My heart swells like the water at wait
Can't stop myself before it's too late
Hold on to your heart
Because I'm coming to take you
Hold on to your heart
Because I'm coming to break you

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
(The hardest of hearts, the hardest hearts)
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
(The hardest of hearts)

The hardest of hearts, the hardest of hearts
(Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on)
The hardest of hearts
(Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on)
