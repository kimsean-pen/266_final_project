I tried the best that I could
It turns me off when it goes wrong
I tried the best that I could
It turns me off when it goes wrong
I was shoving it in your face
But you kept trying to let me down
But you kept trying to.let me down

I follow you
(I hope you never stop)
If you follow me
(I hope you never stop)
I follow you
(I hope you never stop)
If you follow me
(I hope you never stop)

Whoever told you you were rough?
You keep pulling it with your mouth
You never tell me what is wrong
And I keep pushing it to your mouth
You shouldn't listen to what they say
I swear I'm good just look at me
Just look at me

I follow you
(I hope you never stop)
If you follow me
(I hope you never stop)
I follow you
(I hope you never stop)
If you follow me

I thought you never would
I just thought that you would
I thought you never would
I just thought that you would

I follow you
(I hope you never stop)
If you follow me
(I hope you never stop)
I follow you
(I hope you never stop)
If you follow me
(I hope you never stop)
I follow you
(I hope you never stop)
If you follow me
I hope you never stop
