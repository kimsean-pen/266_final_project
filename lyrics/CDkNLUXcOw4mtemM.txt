Yeah, yeah, I heard some kids telling me
How they've lost all the faith in the way
They've been talking world peace
And the wars in the streets

The lines on their faces so deep
A revolution, or reach out
And touch the day
We're overdue, child

Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change

Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
No

I feel the the future in the hands
Of our youth will be safe
No more lies
Old, tired fools tell our future
With tarot cards, and lie of crime

Well, the lines on their faces so deep, yeah
A revolution, or reach out
And touch the day
We're overdue, child

Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change

Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change

Yeah
I'll change
Well, I'll change
Not tomorrow but today

Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change

Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change
Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change
Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change
