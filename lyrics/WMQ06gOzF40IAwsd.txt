Do you believe?

Do you believe that I'm still with you?
Or have you given up entirely? (Entirely)
I still see you all the time
And your voice rings so loud
Maybe this is what they call a sign
Nothing is the same and I can't be free
Bury me, I'm where you want to be

Can we go back to better days
When we felt so alive? (Felt so alive)
When a moment could last forever
All I needed was a little more time

My eyes have seen the future
This place is so fucking hollow
I am everything you're not
Just erase these useless thoughts
I am every fucking lie
I should have said goodbye

Can we go back to better days
When we felt so alive? (Felt so alive)
When a moment could last forever
All I needed was a little more time
Can we go back to better days
When we felt so alive? (Felt so alive)
When a moment could last forever
All I needed was a little more time

If I could only fix this mess
We wouldn't be here in the first place
Everywhere I turn
I see your face
Do you believe?

I know you're out there, watching over me
So long, so long, my friend, so long
I know you're out there, watching over me
So long, so long, my friend, so long
