All the things you said to me
I felt like butter in the heat
When I close my eyes
It get's dark, but it's nice

All the things you said to me
I felt like butter in the heat
When I close my eyes
It get's dark, but it's nice

If the sun doesn't shine
The moon will soon rise
If the sun doesn't shine
The moon will soon rise
If the sun doesn't shine

Someday I'll realize
Silence can bring surprises
Time travels in my mind
Time travels in my mind
Time travels in my mind
Time travels in my mind

If I see you in my life
There's no need to pretend
Remember when you knocked on my door?
Saying: I think I lost your love

Don't fall
Don't fall apart
It's too late
We're heading diferent ways now

Don't fall
Don't fall apart
It's too late
We're heading diferent ways now

Don't fall
Don't fall apart
It's too late
We're heading diferent ways now

Don't fall
Don't fall apart
It's too late
We're heading diferent ways now
