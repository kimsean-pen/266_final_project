As daylight returns
The fires of hope still burn
Crawl through darkened lights
Sickened by the mournful sight

Tears fall from eyes
Not sure what has been done
Sorrow creeps throughout my soul
All is lost, none have won

The battle smoke remains
Begin to feel the pain
Alone now, stagger on
Unsure how it begun

Through time war prevails
Thoughts fears cast aside
Face the consequence alone
With honor, valor, pride

As fire fills the sky
We once believed in life
Now time to die
For victory, for victory

Now in death's glory
Man's final destiny
The final price to pay
For victory

They shall not grow old
As we that are left grow old
Age shall not weary them
Nor the years condemn

At the going down of the sun
And in the morning
We will remember them
We will remember them
