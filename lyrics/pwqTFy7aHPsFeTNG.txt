Caught between a crossfire
Separate from all your thoughts

You are walking around with your head in the clouds
Who really knows knows when you'll come back down?
I'll be the grounded voice but I don't even think of you now

Your world is crashing down
No one can hold your ground
Can't go another round
No one can save you now
And I won't be the one
To fucking hold my tongue
I don't know what you want
I've given all I've got

Feel the weight on your shoulder
Stay with a friend, I know it's getting colder
Can you feel the weight on your shoulder
Stay with a friend, it's getting colder

The water's rising, left you to [?]
I'm treading water to keep myself afloat
Can't watch you sink [?]

Look me in my eyes
Tell me what you see, tell me what you see
I've been awake and I can't take anymore
I won't lose sleep, no I won't waste my time
When I stare in your eyes
I don't know what I see
If I see anything
Are there still pieces of you shining through
Are there still pieces of the one I knew

So why am I getting caught up in everything that's going on
I lost my nerve, get a hold of it, hold of it

Your world is crashing down
No one can hold your ground
Can't go another round
No one can save you now
And I won't be the one
To fucking hold my tongue
I don't know what you want
I've given all I've got
Your world is crashing down
No one can hold your ground
Can't go another round
No one can save you now
And I won't be the one
To fucking hold my tongue
I don't know what you want
I've given all I've got

Feel the weight on your shoulder
Stay with a friend, I know it's getting colder
Can you feel the weight on your shoulder
Stay with a friend, it's getting colder

Before you turn away
Take a good look, remember my face
Before you turn away
Take a good look, remember my face
