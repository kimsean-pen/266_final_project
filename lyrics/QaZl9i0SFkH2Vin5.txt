Born the daughter of a comedian
Middle of the 80s
Someone turn that awful mouth-breathing down
Or else

Sally Hatchet lives in a hole in the ground
The longer it keeps raining the more she has to struggle to maintain a wonderful time
Oh yeah

Oh wanna to love it up without me
I've got smoke in my lungs
And a past life in the trunk

Could he rattle by the way that she empties a few clips out
Do I have a choice now?
Point that thing away from me
Lady
