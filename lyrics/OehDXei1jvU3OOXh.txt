Hold me
This world is falling down on me
Feel it
Is it the dead or death that walks among us?

Close your eyes, but stay awake
They are trying to crawl inside your head
Wish I could end this all today
But like all good, our hope fades away

Hold me
Few more steps and I will fall
Watch me
I'll take you with me
Too sad to leave alone

Burden on my shoulders
Curse of man
No stepping back
I'll take you there
No life, no cries
No more sleepless nights

Close your eyes, but stay awake
They are trying to crawl inside your head
Wish I could end this all today
But like all good, our hope fades away
Close your eyes, but stay awake
They are trying to crawl inside your head
Wish I could end this all today
But like all good, our hope fades away
