All I really want is something beautiful to say
(All I really want is something beautiful to say)
All I really want is something beautiful to say

Ooh, Aooooh, aooh, aooooh
(All I really want is something beautiful to say)

Keep me locked up in your broken mind
I've keep searching, never been able
to find a light behind your dead eyes
Not anything at all

You keep living in your own lie
Ever deceitful and ever unfaithful
Keep me guessing, keep me terrified
Take everything from my world

Aooh, aooooh

Say can you help me, right before the fall (aooh)
Take what you can and lead me to the wolves (aooooh)

Keep me dumb, keep me paralyzed
Why try swimming, I'm drowning in fable
You're not that same, that you externalize
You're not anything at all

(All I really want is something beautiful to say)

It's oh so playful when you demonize
To spit out the hateful, you're willing and able
Words are weapons of the terrified
You're nothing in my world (All I really want is something beautiful to say)

Aooh, aooooh

Say can you help me, right before the fall (aooh)
Take what you can and lead me to the wolves (aooooh)

All I really want is something beautiful to say
Keep me guessing, keep me terrified
All I really want is something beautiful to say
You keep living in your own lies

All I really want is something beautiful to say
To never fade away
I wanna live forever
All I really want is something beautiful to say
To never fade away
I wanna live forever

You keep living in your own lie (aooh)
Keep me guessing (aooooh)
keep me terrified
All I really want is something beautiful to say
(All I really want is something beautiful to say)

Aooh, aooooh

Say can you help me, right before the fall (aooh)
Take what you can and lead me to the wolves (aooooh)

All I really want is something beautiful to say
Words are weapons of the terrified
All I really want is something beautiful to say
Keep me guessing, keep me terrified

All I really want is something beautiful to say
To never fade away
I wanna live forever
All I really want is something beautiful to say
To never fade away
I wanna live forever
