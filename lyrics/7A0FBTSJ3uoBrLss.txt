Cold and risen from the grave
Hidden years will tell no tales
Now you seek what only heart can see
Frozen in so many ways

Drifting through the light inside
A lucent image in the dark
Fickle and dismayed
Someone cast a shadow
Blurring all the pictures on the pages

Hide the pieces, I become the sun
Shining through, what became of you
Early morning, no time to lose
Chills my heart, and I come undone

Quiet timeless silhouette
Forgotten fragments of my dreams
Pleasure and disgust
Shining golden figure in the background

Hide the pieces, I become the sun
Shining through, what became of you
Early morning, no time to lose
Chills my heart, and I come undone
