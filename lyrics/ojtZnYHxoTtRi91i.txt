Tell me, what's the use of a 24-inch waist
If you don't touch me?
Tell me, what's the use again
Of being on TV every day if you don't watch me?

This house is full of emptiness
My closet's full of dresses that I'll never wear
My life is full of people
But you're my only friend, my best friend

Hope it isn't too late to say "I love you"
Hope it isn't too late to say that without you
This place looks like London, it rains every day
Don't you know it, babe?
I'm only half a body without your embrace

Let me tell you why my heart is an unfurnished room
Any suggestions?
Don't have to tell you more than that
'Cause no one knows me like you do
Without exception

This house is full of emptiness
My closet's full of dresses that I'll never wear
My life is full of people
But you're my only friend, my best friend

Hope it isn't too late to say "I love you"
Hope it isn't too late to say that without you
This place looks like London, it rains every day
Don't you know it, babe?
I'm only half a body without your embrace

Hope it isn't too late to say "I love you"
Hope it isn't too late to say that without you
This place looks like London, it rains every day
Don't you know it, babe?
I'm only half a body without your embrace
