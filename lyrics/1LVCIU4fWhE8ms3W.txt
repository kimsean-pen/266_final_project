Distant flickering, greener scenery
This weather's bringing it all back again
Great adventures, faces in condensation
I'm going outside and take it all in

You say too late to start
Got your heart in a headlock
I don't believe any of it
You say too late to start
With your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this

Wear a different pair, just something out of step
Throw a stranger an unexpected smile
With big intention, still posted at your station
Always on about the day it should have flown

You say too late to start
Got your heart in a headlock
I don't believe any of it
You say too late to start
With your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this

Afraid to start
Got your heart in a headlock
I don't believe any of it
You say too late to start
With your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this

(You've) been walking, you've been hiding
And you look half dead half the time
Monitoring you, like machines do
You've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye

(You've) been walking, you've been hiding
And you look half dead half the time
Monitoring you, like machines do
You've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye

You know you're better than this

Come back and start
Got your heart in a headlock
No I don't believe any of it
You say too late to start
With your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this

Afraid to start
Got your heart in a headlock
I don't believe any of it
You say too late to start
With your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this
