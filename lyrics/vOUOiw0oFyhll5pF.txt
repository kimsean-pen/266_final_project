Yesterday
Yesterday I looked around
I found out
My mistakes
Cost me everything I had
Now I know
Don't ever get comfortable
Never get too attached
Never get close
Don't hold on
Don't ever get anyone
Let you believe that you're
Anything more
Than a failure
In between defeat
I was on my way
To somewhere I called home
Then I realized there's no such place
Stop reaching out
Stop here and lay back down
Dont get up
Stop letting yourself believe
You deserve anything
Other than what
You have earned
Stop-
I thought I could keep everything
I could be anyone
Look at me now
I'm a failure
Still between defeats
I was on my way
Walking down the street
I have paid for all of my crimes but I haven't paid for her
I will pay for it now
But let me tell you first
You're in for a world of hurt
Stop reaching out
Everyone
Lets you down
Stop reaching out
Everyone you love
Lets you down
Stop reaching out
Lie back down
Don't get up
