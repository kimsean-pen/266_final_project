For as long as I remember
For as long as I've been blue
Every day since we've been parted
All I've thought about was you

Didn't need the time for sorrow
Didn't need the time for pain
What am I supposed to do
When living without you
Was the worst I ever knew?
In a moment like this
Wanna know, wanna know

Wanna know what you're looking for
Wanna know, wanna know

Wanna know, could you ask for more?
In a moment like this
Wanna know, wanna know
Wanna know what I have to do

Wanna know, wanna know
Wanna know how to get to you

In a moment like this
Ever since the day you left me
Ever since you went away
I'm lost and I don't know
Where am I supposed to go?
I still miss you so
In a moment like this
Wanna know, wanna know
Wanna know what you're looking for
Wanna know, wanna know
Wanna know, could you ask for more?
Oh, in a moment like this
When I need for you to hold me
Say you'll love and never leave me
My heart will forever be true
In a moment like this
Wanna know, wanna know
Wanna know what you're looking for
Wanna know, wanna know
Wanna know, could you ask for more?
In a moment like this
Wanna know, wanna know
Wanna know what I have to do
Wanna know, wanna know
Wanna know how to get to you
In a moment like this
