Everyday at twilight
When the sun turns red in the sky
i think of you on that shoreline
Brushing your hair from your eyes
We were drawing our names on the wet sand
and running away as the tide rode in

Wherever you are, no matter how far
I promise that i won't give up on you
They say other side means other mind
They couldn't be further from the truth
Cause i'm in love with you
I'm still in love with you

Even if there is an ocean
keeping your heart from mine
That doesn't mean i'm not thinking
about you all the time
I'm counting the days till i see you,
and somewhere i know that you are too

Wherever you are, no matter how far
I promise that i won't give up on you
They say the other side means other lie
They couldn't be further from the truth
cause i'm in love with you
I'm still in love with you
oh oh oh

Summertime of our lives
nothing has ever felt so right
Summertime of our lives
even though, we had to say goodbye
i know when the world gets wrong
You'll come back to me

Cause wherever you are, no matter how far
I promise that i won't give up on you
They say the other side means other lie
They couldn't be further from the truth

Wherever you are, no matter how far
I promise that i won't give up on you
They say other side means other lie
They couldn't be further from the truth
i'm in love with you
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you
no oh oh
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you babe
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh. yeah
oh oh, oh oh, uh uh
uh uh, uh uh, uh uh
uh uh, uh uh, uh oh
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love
I'm still in love with you, oh babe
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you, no oh
I'm in love with you
uh oh, oh oh
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you
