In times of fading light
A story we both read
I got two copies on the third board
Blood red letters

Texture on the headline and I wonder
Will they be drawn away in a year or two
Mistakes are there to be made

Is it a feature of fighting
That you can't remember the start
Is it a principle of breaking up
That I'm afraid to stop

Will you call me in the morning
When I got fucked up in the night
Will you save my heart from falling
Will you tell me it's alright

In times of falling leaves
It's easy to hide back
In the darkness of the shelter
And to wait for the winter
You've been the first on the dancefloor
And the last one to leave
Every blossom needs to fade like memories

Is it a feature or fighting
That you can't remember the start
Is it a principle of breaking up
That I'm afraid to stop

Will you call me in the morning
When I got fucked up in the night
Will you save my heart from falling
Will you tell me it's alright

I got stories that I want to tell you
There are pictures that we need to paint

Tell my sister I am gone
Tell my brother to drum on
Tell the world that I've been afraid
But I'm not the only one

Will you call me in the morning
I got fucked up in the night
Will you save my heart from falling
Will you tell me it's alright

I got stories that I want to tell you
There are pictures that we need to paint
And it's never been better
