The bleak life and modern times
Of grey skies and electric light

Life... life... So life is precious, after all
Respect the body, for it is all you really are
Life... life... So life is precious after all
Protect the body, for it is all that keeps you on

We are confined, to the nature of reality
Where the failure of our system, will be the end of our dream
Between the fields of darkness, before and after we exist
Earth is a spiritual place, but there is nothing after this.

We were nothing... for a billion years before our time
And we will be... nothing more again, for an eternity yet to come

Whoa! Death is not an exit (death is the flick of the switch)
Whoa! Death is not an exit (death is a flick of off the switch)

The bleak life and modern times... Of grey skies and electric light
In the bleak life and modern times... Of grey skies and electric light
