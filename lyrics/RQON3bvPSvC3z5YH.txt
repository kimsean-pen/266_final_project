Looking back
The day you left
Where you been
I can only guess

Where I'll be
Some other day
A memory
With all I had to say

You made the love
You had to stare
It made me turn
I built an island there

When I dream
I see your face
That's when we left
Somewhere in outer-space

The Angels over me have seen me cry in agony
The Angels over they all believe this sign of me

Growin' up, without a cause
I hid a tune
And held my own applause
And in the right, and there's a wrong
It's my mistake
I knew it all along
I've been a fool
What's done is done
I can't erase
And I refuse to run
I'm beggin' you
To please forgive
My heart is true
It's just the way I live

The Angels over me have seen me cry in agony
The Angels over they all believe this sign of me

They've seen my cry
They've seen my cry
They've seen my cry

The Angels over me have seen me cry in agony
(They've seen my cry)
The Angels over they all believe this sign of me
(They've seen my cry)
