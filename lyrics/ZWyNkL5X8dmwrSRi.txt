This is a hammer.
this is a hymn.
This is a match to a ball of light.
This is the blade.
This is the beauty.
These are the stars raining down from the sky

This is the light that shines and I can see the pines are dancing.
This is the leaving of another love.
This is the howling at the moon.
These are the arms you fell into.
I am a fire and I must burn today.

This is an echo.
This is the Glory.
This is the pounding of a midnight heart
This is the mountains.
This is the lighting.
This is the man pulling on his iron chains.

This is the light that shines and I can see the pines are dancing.
This is the leaving of another love.
This is the howling at the moon.
These are the arms you fell into.
I am a fire and I must burn today.
