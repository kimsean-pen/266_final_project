The melody of the v8
Will play for us
Every weekday
I know the autobahn
I know the autobahn
Will be finally completed
I' ll let you ride my jag
My passionate favorite black cat
The decay of your body
Der Verfall deiner Karosserie
Wird mich immer noch anziehen

Our only philosophy
To spit on polyamory
To spit on
And if we're no longer physical
If we're no longer physical
We can still accelerate
Accelerate

You're 120 and I'm 102
You're 120 and I'm 102
You're nearly blind
You're nearly blind
But 220 is no speed for you
But 220 is no speed for you
Keine Geschwindigkeit
