Curse with me
Profane and discreet
Make her move
Cross veins and chamomile

Soft and sweet
Sea salt, silver meat
Buried deep
In crow skin overcoat

Save your breath
This may be the last
There is no novelty
Here on the earth

Savior
Forever threadbare and faded
Drunken and arcane
Curse the day

Savior
Rot gutted whiskey in ladies
For to ease the pain
Drown away

Save her
Crushed all the bones and the cradles
All along the way
Along the way
