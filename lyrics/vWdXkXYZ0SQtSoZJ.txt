I uncoil the serpents spine
In the soil of your desire
Deep inside your star divine

I taste the blood of the scarlet cry
From the cup of her desire
Deep inside her star of five

I want to drown you in your faith
I want to crown it with my hate
I want to burn it in my pit of fire

I uncover the tellurian lie
In the oil of their design
Deep inside the lodge of five

I taste the blood of the scarlet cry
From the cup of her desire
Deep inside her star of five

I want to drown you in your faith
I want to crown it with my hate
I want to burn it in my pit of fire

I walk outside of these human lines
Navigating a path of lies
Starve my flesh and leave it behind
