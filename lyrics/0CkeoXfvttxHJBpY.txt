You can tuck it on the inside
You can throw it on the floor
You can wave it on the outside
Like you never did before
You get the diplomatic treatment
You get the force fed future
Get the funk after death
Get the wisenheimer brainstorm

(I'm in touch with your world)
So don't you try to hide it
(I'm in touch with your world)
And nobody's gonna buy it
It's such a lovely way to go
It's such a lovely way to go

I been lying on your feathers
You keep talkin' about the weather
I'm a psilocybin pony
You're a flick fandango phony
It's a sticky contradiction
It's a thing you call creation
Everything is science fiction
And I ought to know

(I'm in touch with your world)
So don't you try to hide it
(I'm in touch with your world)
And nobody's gonna buy it
It's such a lovely way to go
It's such a lovely way to go-uh-o-o-o

(I'm in touch with your world)
(I'm in touch with your world)
(I'm in touch with your world)
(I'm in touch with your world)
