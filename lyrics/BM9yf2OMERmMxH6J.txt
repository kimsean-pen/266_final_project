I don't give a damn about them
I'ma do me
And if I had to choose, me or you?
I'd choose me

When the money ain't around
And the bitches ain't around
Who the fuck gon' be around?
Me

When the money ain't around
And the bitches ain't around
Who the fuck gon' be around?
Me

They say it's bad for me
Can't help it
Can't lose it
I love it
That's true shit
What more could you want?
So sad for me
Can't lose ya
Can't help it
I love you
Will you still be down?

When the money ain't around
And the bitches ain't around
Who the fuck gon' be around?
Me

When the money ain't around
And the bitches ain't around
Who the fuck gon' be around?
Me

And it goes
On and on, and on, and on, life is what you make it
Around me
On and on, and on, and on, and on
Life's what you make it
On and on, and on, and on and it goes
Life is what you make it
It goes
On and on, and on, and on, and on...
