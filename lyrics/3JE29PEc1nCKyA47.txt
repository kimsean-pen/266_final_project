Cosmic havoc in oblivious embrace
To deport this alternation
Arcade of aeons, motion in time
Dissolves in absolution

Conflagration back to primordial condition
Cosmogenesis life and death

In ethereal skies, we transcend in eclectic divine
As a glimpse of light, forevermore
In wandering stars, we emerge from light to abyss
As abandoned gods, we redeem in purgatory

Deliverance, a slender form of desolation
In bareness, beyond profound abyss
Perception, a final glimpse of dignity
In radiation of the blackest light

Retrogression, in solitary meditation
In clarity, consigned to infinity
Perpetuity, a constant shattered past
In sempiternal neutrality

In ethereal skies, we transcend in eclectic divine
As a glimpse of light, forevermore
In wandering stars, we emerge from light to abyss
As abandoned gods, we redeem in purgatory
