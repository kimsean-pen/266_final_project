Girl, sometimes it seems to me
That I don't say the things I should, to you, I act like I'm no good
You wait for me patiently
This house is not a home without you, it takes two hearts to share

Your eyes will always see through me, and bring me to my knees
And I will always turn to you, you're everything I need

And through the good and bad times, you have always been there
We hold each other close, you tell me it's alright
The nights we fight about it, never dream of giving up
That's the price of love

Look, sometimes it makes us cry
Forgive me when I get it wrong, sometimes it's hard to be that strong
And oh, I would do anything
For you I'd turn the stars around, I'd find a way somehow

This time, you see I built a bridge to you again
Love shines, we'll sweep away the past
We're more than lovers, more than friends

And through the good and bad times, you have always been there
We hold each other tight, you tell me it's alright
The nights we fight about it, never think of giving up
That's the price of love

Your eyes will always see through me, and bring me to my knees
And I will always turn to you, you're everything I need

And through the good and bad times, you have always been there
We hold each other close, you tell me it's alright
And sometimes I can't give enough, that's the price of love

That's the price of love, that's the price of love
That's the price of love...
