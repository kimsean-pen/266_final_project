I'm only ragtag, life in a bag
I've been sleeping in a bus, this trust singing la da da doe
I got the feeling I was nickel-and-dimed
That was probably a lie for this semi-conscious state of mind
Rush, rush, rush for the gold, don't scatter too much
I'm sipping cocktails, fish scales, falling for love
I'm falling for love
Reason (reason, reason)
Is gone (long gone!)

Spun (are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)
Undone (are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)
Yeah reason, reason, reason is gone
(are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)
I'm spun
(are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)

I'm only ragtag, life in a bag,
Flying by, drip dry, lo-fi, singing la da da doe
Rush, rush, rush, down in sound
Hitch a ride, top side, high tide
Free falling for love
I'm falling for love
Reason (reason reason) is gone

So long
Spun (are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)
Undone (are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)
Yeah reason, reason, reason is gone
(are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)
I'm spun
(are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)
(are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)
