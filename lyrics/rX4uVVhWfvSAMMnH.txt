eter is smart, he knows each European country by heart
He likes to sit under an apple tree on his yard
And wait for an apple to fall
When Peter is nine, his teacher tells him that this planet is dying
That someone needs to put an end to it all
And so when Peter comes home, he tells his mom:

I'm going out in the world to save our planet
And I ain't coming back until she's saved
I'll walk my way to see the king and parliament
If they don't help, I'll do it by myself
I don't wanna be...
Dadadam dadadam dadadada dadada dadam...

Peter is young, he tries to talk, but no one listens to him
Everybody's busy living and dying, not thinking about what they're doing.
But look at the boy who went out in the world to save our planet
And he ain't coming back until she's saved
He walked his way to see the king and parliament
But they all turned their heads and walked away, singing:

Dadadam dadadam dadadada dadada dadam...
Dadadam dadadam dadadada dadada dadam...

And now I'm going out in the world to save our planet
And I ain't coming back until she's saved
I'm walking in the footsteps that young Peter made
And everybody is welcome to join, and sing with me:

Dadadam dadadam dadadada dadada dadam...
Dadadam dadadam dadadada dadada dadam...
Dadadam dadadam dadadada dadada dadam...
