I Don't Know
That You Want To Try
Evertime You See

Do You Remember
When We Fell In Love
We Were Young

And Innocent Then
Do You Remember
How It All Began
It Just Seemed Like Heaven
So Why Did It End?

Do You Remember
(I Bet You Remember)
Way Back In The Fall
(I Bet You Remember)
We'd Be Together
(I Bet You Remember)

All Day Long
(I Bet You Remember)
Do You Remember
(I Bet You Remember)
Us Holding Hands
(I Bet You Remember)
In Each Other's Eyes
(I Bet You Remember)
We'd Stare
(I Bet You Remember)
(Tell Me)

Do You Remember The Time
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time
When We First Met Girl
Do You Remember The Time
(Oh I)
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time

Do You Remember
How We Used To Talk
Ya Know We'd Stay On The Phone
At Night Till Dawn
Do You Remember
All The Things We Said
Like I Love You So
I'll Never Let You Go

Do You Remember
(I Bet You Remember)
Way Back In The Spring
(I Bet You Remember)
Every Morning Birds Would Sing
(I Bet You Remember)
Do You Remember
(I Bet You Remember)
Those Special Times
(I Bet You Remember)

They'll Just Go On And On
(I Bet You Remember)
In The Back Of My Mind
(I Bet You Remember)

Do You Remember The Time
(Oh I)
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time
When We First Met Girl
Do You Remember The Time
(Oh I)
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time

Those Sweet Memories
Will Always Be Dear To Me
And Girl No Matter What Was Said
I Will Never Forget What We Had
Now Baby

Do You Remember The Time
(Do You Remember)
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time
When We First Met Girl
Do You Remember The Time
(Oh I)
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time

Remember My Baby

Do You Remember The Time
(Cause I Remember)
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time
All In My Mind Girl
Do You Remember The Time
(Oh I)
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time
Remember My Baby

Remember The Time
Oou

Do You Remember Girl
Remember The Times
On The Phone You And Me
(Remember The Times)
Till Dawn, Two Or Three
What About Us Girl
Remember The Times
Do You, Do You, Do You,

In The Park, On The Beach
