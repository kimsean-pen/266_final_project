Maybe I will, maybe I won't

I don't wanna find my home
Just wonder what happened to it
My hand's all caught in stones
Who stole all my bones?
All my forgotten poems
Are a joke, what do I know,
Maybe we're wrong,
Doesn't it show, people get old
When they're alone

Maybe I will, maybe I won't

Seven days over the sea shells
Sunk so many, at least will,
You come visit me,
Finally finding sleep,
Swim around and dream

Stay afloat
Maybe we will, maybe we won't
Doesn't it show, people get old
When they're alone

Maybe I will, maybe I won't
Maybe I will, maybe I won't

The weather is impeccable,
We're riding to a festival
When suddenly it's gray
Do not be afraid
For the wind it doesn't stay

It blows and goes away
It blows and goes but never shows its face

Doesn't it show, people get old
When they're alone,
What do I know,
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

Maybe I will, maybe I won't (maybe I will, maybe I won't)
Maybe I will, maybe I won't (maybe I will, maybe I won't)
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
