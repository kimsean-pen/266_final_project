You told me once,
Back at it again always the same with it,
I can't stop you
Well maybe it's true for you, but I'm not seeing it

You wanna live with it, but I've got no room
Well maybe it's true for you, and I won't stop you
Give me some space to breathe, 'cause I've got no room
Well maybe it's true for you, and I can't stop you

Give me some space to breathe,
'Cause I can't rest here with you
I've gotta be reasonable but it's all become too predictable
I'm letting it ride, but I'm not losing sleep

This future is not up to you
Rise up for the innocent
Tried it on but it didn't fit
Guard down, there's a subtle flame subtle moment to have your say

Lining up opposite of me
What a moment of clarity,
A shining moment to say... for what?
I know, so what!

I'm not about it, you can have it
I've gotta be reasonable but it's all become too predictable
I'm letting it ride, but I'm not losing sleep
This future is not up to you

I'm not losing sleep
Rise up for the innocent
Tried it on but it didn't fit.
Guard down, there's a subtle flame subtle moment to have your say.
