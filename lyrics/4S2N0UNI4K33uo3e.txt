Nananana naa...
Hey you, see me, pictures crazy
All the world I've seen before me, passing by

I've got, nothing, to gain, to lose
All the world I've seen before me, passing by
You don't care about how I feel!

I don't feel there anymore!
You don't care about how I feel!
I don't feel there anymore!
You don't care about how I feel!
I don't feel there anymore!
You don't care about how I feel!
I don't feel there anymore!
(Anymore) Na nana nana na nana...
Hey you, are me, not so pretty

All the world I've seen before me, passing by

Silent, my voice, I've got no choice
All the world I've seen before me, passing by
You don't care about how I feel!
I don't feel there anymore!

You don't care about how I feel!
I don't feel there anymore!

You don't care about how I feel
I don't feel there anymore!
You don't care about how I feel!
I don't feel there anymore!

I don't see! (anymore!)
I don't hear! (anymore!)
I don't speak! (anymore!)
I don't feel!

Na nana nana na nana...
Hey you, see me, pictures crazy
All the world I've seen before me, passing by

I've got, nothing, to gain, to lose
All the world I've seen before me, passing by
You don't care about how I feel!

I don't feel there anymore!
You don't care about how I feel!
I don't feel there anymore!
You don't care about how I feel!

I don't feel there anymore!
You don't care about how I feel!
I don't feel there anymore!
I don't sleep! (anymore!)

I don't eat! (anymore!)
I don't live! (anymore!)
I don't feel! (anymore!)
