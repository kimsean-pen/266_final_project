Oh Mr. Maker he's got it made
A beautiful wife and a baby on the way
And his bills are already paid
No need to skimp
No need to save

But all around him the world grows hard
He thinks to himself he must've played a lucky card
If he was alone he'd give it all away
To people and things that he wanted to save

But oh no
It's alright
Mr. Maker he'll be fine
It's alright
It's OK
Because of the love he gave away
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Doesn't stop to think it's because of he
Always doing right he stays healthy
The girls in the alley won't get hold of him
He's got no time for that kind of sin and he
He's not a member of the Catholic church
The pastor of his town got sent down for dirt
He sees the boys from Sunday school
It's hard to believe what you've read in the morning news

But oh no
It's alright
Mr. Maker he'll be fine
It's alright
It's OK
Because of the love he gave away
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Heart beat
Stay heavy
Love us all please
Stay on your feet
For me
For me
Stay on your feet
For me
Stay on your feet
For me

But oh no
It's alright
Mr. Maker he'll be fine
It's alright
It's OK
Because of the love he gave away
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
