I asked the sun to let us go
What was a frozen sphere got to spinning too close
Those waters gave way to all walks of life
I watch them propagate
Choking out the life
Working on a hive mind of the greatest good
Anything that I could hurt, I would for free
Never knew that turning the odds around
Could feel so sweet
