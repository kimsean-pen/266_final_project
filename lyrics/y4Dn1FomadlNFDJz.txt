I'm not searching
For whatever when he found
But I could change anything you don't like
We live in a reasonable time
I'm not a servant
To my own desires
I'll trade in anythin'
You don't like
We live in a reasonable times

I have had enough, had enough
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I'm u
What you want me to do

I have had enough, had enough
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I'm u
What you want me to do

IM U, IM U, IM U
If this' what you lost
It's true
I cannot let you walk
Knowing I am u
I'm what you want me to do

I have had enough, had enough
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I'm u
What you want me to do
