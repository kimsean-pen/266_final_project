Ninety miles outside chicago
Can't stop driving i don't know why
So many questions i need an answer
Two years later you're still on my mind

What ever happened to Emilia Airheart
Who holds stars up in the sky
It's true love just once in a lifetime
Did the captain of the titanic cry

Someday we'll know
if love could move a mountain
Someday we'll know why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
why i wasn't meant for you

Does anybody know the way to Atantis
Or what the wind says when she cries
I'm speeding by the place that i met you
For the ninety-seventh time ... tonite

Someday we'll know if love could move a mountain
Someday we'll know why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
why i wasn't meant for you

Someday we'll know why Samson loved Dilaila
One day i'll go dancing on the moon
Someday you'll know
that i was the one for you

I bought a ticket to the end of the rainbow
I watch the stars crash in the sea
If i could ask God just one question
Why aren't you here with me ... tonite

Someday we'll know if love could move a mountain
Someday we'll know
why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
why i wasn't meant for you

Someday we'll know why Samson loved Dilaila
One day i'll go dancing on the moon
Someday you'll know that i was the one for you
