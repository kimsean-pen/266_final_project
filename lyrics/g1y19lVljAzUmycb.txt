I wasnt sure
If you coming back to me
All of your loving
The plans you wrote our sweet melody
These are the days
The days that reflect in from the times that we had
Im going away all the love
Until the day when you come home
Dont you know Ill never love another friend?
All my love for you
Search the world, Ill find you
Another man of your kind
And say all the years attending me
I was on a rough patch
When I realized I looked back
And I knew what I saw
I saw you play a song for me
You brought me to tears
You brought me people
Dropped me to my knees
It was love, love for real
It was something that Id never feel
Dont you know Ill never love another friend?
All my love for you
Search the world, Ill find you
Another man of your kind
And say all the years attending me
Together we fall
And we left the storm behind
You gave me shelter
And it helped her pass the time
I dont wanna wait
I dont wanna let you pass me by
Dont you know Ill never love another friend?
All my love for you
Search the world, Ill find you
Another man of your kind
And say all the years attending me
Dont you know Ill never love another friend?
All my love for you
Search the world, Ill find you
Another man of your kind
And say all the years attending me
You set me free
Dont you know Ill never love another friend?
Dont you know that youre the only one?
All my love for you
Search the world, Ill find you
Another man of your kind
And say all the years attending me
Dont you know that youre a part of me?
