The Jesus nut, the London eye
The sweet surrender, the last goodbye
City of evil, city of churches
Janissary, mercenary
A la croat
Gospel, scripture, church and pope
We dare to differ so dance from a rope
I stand informed as opposed to corrected
The plaintive cry
From the Lorelei
The Jesus nut, the London eye
The sweet surrender, the last goodbye
City of evil, city of churches
Janissary, mercenary
A la croat

I've forgotten more than I've done
I remember more than I did
God, a pale curse
In my own universe
I've forgotten more than I've done
I remember more than I did
God, a pale curse
In my own universe
A curse
