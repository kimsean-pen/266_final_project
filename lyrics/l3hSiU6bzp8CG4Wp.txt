Inactive veins
Animate
From cells of red

Fragile hands
Contaminate
The resting bed

Insects will crawl upon my skin
Insects will eat me from within
Insects will crawl upon my skin
Insects will eat me from within

Disect you skin
Integrate
Program the head

An eyeless face
with teeth they ate
Your body's dead

Insects will crawl upon my skin
Insects will eat me from within
Insects will crawl upon my skin
Insects will eat me from within
