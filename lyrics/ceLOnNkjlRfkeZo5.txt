I'm sorry dear i haven't been sleeping
because when i have i woke up and thought it was winter
i'm sorry love for leaving you out
my head is an empty house when you're not around

i'm sorry dear i haven't felt much like company
but if september won't bring you to me
then i don't care

i'm sorry dear for ignoring the phone
i've got clumsy feet and clumsy toes to keep me from home
