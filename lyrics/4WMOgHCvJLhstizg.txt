All alone beside myself
All alone beside myself
And I've troubles on my mind
And I've reached the depths of life
And I hear that deaths alright
Still I'll wait for you to try

When the dreams have been and gone
And the torment has begun
My emotions run
Can't get by with what I've got
Always dwell on what I've lost
Just a loaded gun
A symbol of my life
A symbol of my life

On the floor I crawl and writhe
As the day turns into night
I remove myself from sight
And I reached the depths alright
And I hear deaths part of life
Still I wish that you would try

When a dream has been and gone
And the torment has begun
The rejections done
I get by with what I've got
Always aware if what I've lost
Just a loaded gun
A symbol of my life
A symbol of my life

A symbol of my life
A symbol of my life
Nothing more
Nothing more to say to me
