I wake the morning sun, gold as the ring that I wore
Back when we woke as one, on a distant shore...
There life is blooming now, close by the wide oceans roar
If I could buy wings I'd fly to that distant shore

When you think of me, sing a heart-spun song
When it's over, sing it once more
When you dream of me, dream when I'll meet you
On that distant shore

Love sleeping in my arms, eyes like your father before
Born to have your father's need for a distant shore

When you think of me, sing a wide-open song
When it's over, sing it once more
When you dream of me, dream when I'll meet you
On that distant shore

Life is a stormy sea, hearts can be tattered and torn
I still believe peace can be found, on that distant shore

When you think of me, sing an unbroken song
When it's over, sing it once more
When you dream of me, dream when I'll meet you
On that distant shore
On that distant shore
