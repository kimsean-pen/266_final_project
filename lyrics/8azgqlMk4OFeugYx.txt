If I had your love
You would be what most inspires me
Sacred soul, fantasy, brightest light
Guiding me on wings

You would be the heart inside me
What I'd wish on a star
All to me, that is what you are

If I had your love
I could live my dream
Flying high above everything
If I had your love
You would light my world
That would be enough
If I had your love

Oh... if I held you close
Feeling your heart beat beside me
Fast asleep, wide awake, every step
Every move I make

If I had your love
I could live my dream
Flying high above everything
If I had your love
You would light my world
That would be enough
If I had your love

If I had your love
I'd live out my dream
Flying high above
Oh yeah...

If I had your love
I could live my dream
Flying high above everything

If I had your love
You would light my world
That would be enough
If I had your love
