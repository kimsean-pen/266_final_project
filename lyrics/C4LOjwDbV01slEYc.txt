Tell your boyfriend
Next time he's around
To buy his own weed and don't wear my shit down
I wouldn't care if he would give me some more

I'd rather him leave you than leave him my draw
When you smoke all my weed man
You gotta call the green man

So I can get mine
And you get yours
Once is enough
To make me attack

So bring me a bag and your man can come back
I'll check him at the door make sure he got green
I'm tighter than airport security teams

When you smoke all my weed man
You gots to call the green man
So I can get mine
And you get yours
I'm my own man
So when will you learn
That you got a man
But I got to burn
Don't make no difference if I end up alone
I'd rather have myself and smoke my homegrown
It's got me addicted
Does more than any dick did
Yeah, I can get mine
And you get yours
Yeah, I can get mine
And you get yours
