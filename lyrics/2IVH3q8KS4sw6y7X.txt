You can feel it, I can feel it
Like we're both awake and dreaming
There's nowhere else we'd rather be
We're making our own history

'Cause we're a page turner
Heart murmur, science fiction fantasy
We can go to the moon and back
To the moon and back
Without ever leaving

We're right here and we're gonna write the story
Written in the stars like graffiti can't ignore it
Light years and you'll see the comets falling
This is the moment where it all began

They'll see it written in the stars
They'll see it written in the stars
They'll see it written in the stars
We were here
We were here

Every single hero has to start out
Looking like me and you,
So never mind excuses
We can do this if we really want to

Yeah, we can go all around the world
All around the world
And we're not even dreaming

We're right here and we're gonna write the story
Written in the stars like graffiti can't ignore it
Light years and you'll see the comets falling
This is the moment where it all began

They'll see it written in the stars
They'll see it written in the stars
They'll see it written in the stars
We were here
We were here

(You can feel it)
(We can go to the moon and back, to the moon and back without ever leaving)

We're right here, right here
Written in the stars, stars
We're right here
Written in the stars, stars

We're right here and we're gonna write the story
Written in the stars like graffiti can't ignore it
Light years and you'll see the comets falling
This is the moment where it all began

They'll see it written in the stars
They'll see it written in the stars
They'll see it written in the stars
We were here
We were here
