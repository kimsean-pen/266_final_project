Oh, yeah

I've been thinking now for a while
With you, I've got exactly what I need
When I see you stop & turnin' around
& now you've got me shaking in my teeth

I can't afford the kind of love you sell
But I can't afford to ever watch you leave
Won't you come & put your sugar on my tongue
You've got your spell on me

& how could I leave this life to another one?
Take back
Take back those things that I said
& how could I lose your heart to another one?

Take back
Take back those things I've done
I'm the only one who knows

The secret places that the lights don't show

(The lights don't show)
You know
I can't afford the kind of love you own
But I sure as hell could never let you go

Every time I start to tell you no
& then you go & take off all your clothes
& how could I leave this life to another one?
Take back

Take back those things that I said.

& how could I lose your heart to another one?
Take back
Take back those things I've done

Those things I've done
Yeah

I know what no one else knows
Sure as hell can never let you go
No, I won't let you
Go
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Move
& how could I leave this life to another one?
Take back
Take back those things that I've said
& how could I lose your heart to another one?
Take back
Take back those things I've done
& how could I leave this life to another one?
Take back
Take back those things that I've said.
& how could I lose your heart to another one?
Take back
Take back those things that I've done
Oh
