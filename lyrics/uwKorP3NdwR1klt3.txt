Clouds approach as i move through towns and quote
Latin texts found under Rome
Swarming storms
I'm forming horns
I'm pouring O's in styrofoam
Ignoring hoes I might go home
Torn in two the guts get thrown
Them blunts get blown
Afford it on my own
Spend some money now I'm broke
I ain't worried bout it though
I'll get some later down the road
Root of all that's evil i know
666 times for my soul
Slit my wrist I'm sinking low
Lit my list i'm burning slow
Wish for bliss and turn to stone

One time for the projects
Two times for the 7th Ward
3's up for the misfits
$uicide we can't be ignored
Smoke I be blowing put holes in the ozone
Ruby times $lick we smoke out to the O gone
Couple xanbars got me calling to post pone
This bitch who wanna fuck but I can't cuz I'm so gone
Unknown to the world you see
Praised to by the 6 feet deep
Run up if you wanna
Keep a weapon on me
Looking for the right one
I'm the one you seek
Slash, slash
Cut, cut
Cock back
Buck Buck
Claim that you was rough but now you all shot up
Said that you was tough but now you all roughed up
Triple 6 killers and they all fuck ups
