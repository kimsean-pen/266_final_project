Rid me of my blues bring me chocolate in the morning,
No day begins too sweetly after dancing in the ache
Just wipe me from the corners of the mouth you spoke me out of
(bring me) sweet things in the morning
Tender are the days, I made wishes on a cake
tightly shut my eyes and whispered to a flame
All jellyfish and legs, all peanut butter prayered
Still wondering what days go where.
Just a pocket figurine, Just a small thin to a pea
when the world was a recital for my dreams
All pirouettes and light, all polka dots and stripes
unaware of how the day betrays the night...
Rid me of my blues bring me chocolate in the morning,
No day begins too sweetly after dancing in the ache
Just wipe me from the corners of the mouth you spoke me out of
(bring me) sweet things in the morning
Rid me of my blues bring me chocolate in the morning,
No day begins too sweetly after dancing in the ache
Just wipe me from the corners of the mouth you spoke me out of
(bring me) sweet things in the morning
Tender are the days, I made wishes on a cake
tightly shut my eyes and whispered to a flame
All jellyfish and legs, all peanut butter prayered
Still wondering which days go where.
Just a pocket figurine, Just a small thin to a pea
when the world was a recital for my dreams
All pirouettes and light, all polka dots and stripes
unaware of how the day betrays the night...
Rid me of my blues bring me chocolate in the morning,
No day begins too sweetly after dancing in the ache
Just wipe me from the corners of the mouth you spoke me out of
(bring me) sweet things in the morning
(musical break)
Rid me of my blues bring me chocolate in the morning,
No day begins too sweetly after dancing in the ache
Just wipe me from the corners of the mouth you spoke me out of
(bring me) sweet things in the morning
Rid me of my blues bring me chocolate in the morning,
No day begins too sweetly after dancing in the ache
Just wipe me from the corners of the mouth you spoke me out of
(bring me) sweet things in the morning
Honey bring me sweet things in the morning,
Honey bring me sweet things in the morning.
Honey bring me sweet things in the morning,
Honey give me sweet things in the morning.
