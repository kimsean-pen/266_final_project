Take me to the southern shore
Within emptiness unobstructed
My search for something more

Take me to a higher plane
Within emptiness unobstructed
Some things just can't be explained

Here we are again in this simple valley of deception
Where does it go?
Is it swimming against the flow?
Or does no one ever know?
Destiny, tranquility, validity of soul?

And I will say once more
The world is still a spinning ball of confusion
That no one understands

Within the cold absolute
The cold brutal truth
There is a pained angel

Take me to the southern shore
Within emptiness unobstructed
My search for something more
Take me to a higher plane
Within emptiness unobstructed
Some things just can't be explained

So the river ends
In this calamity we call heaven
Is this perfection
Are we spinning into the grey again
And transforming into the insane

And I will say once more
The world is still a spinning ball of confusion
That no one understands

Within the cold absolute
The cold brutal truth
There is a pained angel

He will shelter you from harm
And sing to you throughout your darkest hours

Take me to the southern shore
Within emptiness unobstructed
My search for something more
Take me to a higher plane
Within emptiness unobstructed
Some things just can't be explained

Take me to the southern shore
Within emptiness unobstructed
My search for something more
Take me to a higher plane
Within emptiness unobstructed
Some things just can't be explained

What grows upon this rock
And its urgent sense of tragedy
Time has stopped
