All i need...
Is a friend
Someone to give me, a helpin' hand
When i'm afraid, in the night
Someone to squeeze me
And tell me, it's all right
Listen...
You know i worry

Such a lot
And i would give, all i've got
Just to have, someone believe in me
Just to do that, and put me back on evenly
Yeah

Baby, baby
Be my friend
Baby, baby

Baby, baby
Be my friend
I will love you, till the very end

A stronger love

You give me something, so strong and true
Listen...
