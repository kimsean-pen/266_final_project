I just wanna pull up (pull up, pull up)
Like UGK used to double cup the fluid (party)
DJ Screw chop suey
Learned that shit from Texas
Swanging that bubble out Lexus
Leaning out every exit
Popping that trunk so reckless
I just wanna pull up (pull up, pull up)
Like UGK used to double cup the fluid (party)
DJ Screw chop suey
Learned that shit from Texas
Swanging that bubble out Lexus
Leaning out every exit
Popping that trunk so reckless

I just wanna come down one day, 'round one day
Candy painted was around one day
Clown one day, show the grill, show the grill
I just wanna bend the corner late night to the early morning
Got a old school with some new component
Back then they didn't want me
Now that I'm swanging they all on me
Now that I'm pulling up clean
I doubled the figure like double the cup of the lean
Glass eyes with the gleam, screams like puppets on strings
Yadadamean
4 pm at the Kappa on swangers and adapters watching me ball yeah
Salamander on the slab,
too mild but how are they watching me crawl yeah

I just wanna pull up (pull up, pull up)
Like UGK used to double cup the fluid (party)
DJ Screw chop suey
Learned that shit from Texas
Swanging that bubble out Lexus

Popping that trunk so reckless
I just wanna pull up (pull up, pull up)
Like UGK used to double cup the fluid (party)
DJ Screw chop suey
Learned that shit from Texas
Swanging that bubble out Lexus
Leaning out every exit
Popping that trunk so reckless

Popping up twice, trunk shaking like a fifth full of dice
Rich gang like a cooler of ice
Chandelier like who need some light
UFOs like who need a ride
Donkey keep the south of the side
Southside while I'm tipping on foes
Shoe flexing when I'm slamming them doors
Top drop keep my halo exposed
Swanged out we cherry a stop
Ron C might go off with the chop
Built a way all the way to the top
Jamming Screw on a take till it pop
Texas gave me a lot, feel like it's home
For in my Crooked with love
Forever is diamonds and wood in the chrome mane

I just wanna pull up (pull up, pull up)
