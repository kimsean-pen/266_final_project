We must play our lives like soldiers in the field
The life is short, I'm running faster all the time
Strength and beauty destined to decay
So cut the rose in full bloom

Till the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood
Till the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood

Everyday through all frustration and despair
Love and hate fight with burning hearts
Till legends live and man is God again
And self-preservation rules the day no more

Oh, we must dream of promised lands and fields
That's never fade in season
As we move towards no end we learn to die
Red tears are shed on gray

Till the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood
Till the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood
Till the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood
Till the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood
