Every night I remember that evenin'
The way you looked when you said you were leaving
The way you cried as you turned to walk away

The cruel words and the false accusations
The mean looks and the same old frustrations
I never thought that we'd throw it all away
But we threw it all away

And I'm a little bit lost without you
And I'm a bloody big mess inside
And I'm a little bit lost without you

This ain't a love song, this is goodbye
This ain't a love song, this is goodbye

I've been lost, I've been out, I've been losing
I've been tired, I'm all hurt and confusion
I've been mad, I'm the kind of man that I'm not

I'm throwin' down, I'll be coming back fighting
I may be scared and a little bit frightened
But I'll be back, I'll be coming back to life

I'll be coming back to life
And I'm a little bit lost without you
And I'm a bloody big mess inside
And I'm a little bit lost without you

This ain't a love song this is goodbye
This ain't a love song this is goodbye

And you can try
(And you can try)
And you can try but you'll never keep me down
And you can try
(And you can try)
And you can try but you'll never keep me down

La la la la, la la la la la
I won't be lost, I won't be down

And I'm a little bit lost without you
And I'm a bloody big mess inside
And I'm a little bit lost without you

This ain't a love song this is goodbye

It's alright
(It's alright)
'Cause you can try but you'll never keep me down
It's alright
(It's alright)
I may be lost but you'll never keep me down
You can try
(You can try)
You can try but you'll never keep me down
You can try
(You can try)
I know I'm lost but I'm waiting to be found
You'll never keep me down
You'll never keep me down
Never keep me down
