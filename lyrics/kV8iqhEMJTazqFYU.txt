Today
It's in the air again today
Another incident that just went off
No way
This time I will not take the blame
It's pretty obvious who needs to shut up
Ashtrays
Filled with the fruits of our transgressions
Here and there sarcasm overflows
Do stay
I'll need this sitcom to be re-run
Till I get the gist of just how it goes

So what would you have me do?

Give me a reason
Come on now make my day
'Cause I'm out of cheeks to
Turn the other way
Ask yourself just how lucky do you feel

Somehow
I've been blindsided by my own kindhearted notion of just
Who we are
No doubt
We'd have collided anyway
With me indicted and you raising alarm
First round
I'll take my bows into my corner
Take my vows, regroup and run back again
Bloodhound
And of no better pedigree
Than what you see so you could not offend

Did I act like a fool 'cause I didn't know what to do when you gave me just a little bit more than I bargained for?
A little too much in my hands when my hands are tied
It's the ultimate fling to go frolicking
Licking the muck from the soles of the boots of your pride
Every time you lied

Give me a reason
Come on now make my day
'Cause I'm out of cheeks to
Turn the other way
Ask yourself just how lucky do you feel
Give me a reason
Come on now make my day
Spoken my pleas now
Someone's gotta pay
Ask yourself just how lucky do you feel

Oh
Yeah
Give me a reason
You make my day!
'Cause someone's gotta pay

Can you give me a reason?
I'm moving into grey
Something I can hold on
At the end of the day
'Cause I can't move on till I know what's the deal

Give me a reason
Come on now make my day
'Cause I'm out of cheeks to
Turn the other way
Ask yourself just how lucky do you feel
Give me a reason
Come on now make my day
Spoken my pleas now
Someone's gotta pay
Ask yourself just how lucky do you feel
