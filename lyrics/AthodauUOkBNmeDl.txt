In an old apartment, down in the garden
I was born on a sunny day when the riots ruled the streets like a Sunday parade
Everyone is cruising, gang signs, we're moving
You know how we're doing, white lines, abusing
On the boulevard, we never go too far
Nothing really matters when you're walking on stars
Last call at the Rainbow Bar
Mistress Los Angeles stole my heart
You can sell yourself if you've got no soul
Nowadays auditions to the devil are sold
From the Boardwalk, I see the ghosts on the beach
Memories of my city keep haunting me

Where's LA? Where's LA? Where's LA?
Whatever happened to the city we knew?
Where's LA? Where's LA? Where's LA?
Whatever happened to the city we knew?

No range of sunshine, all the broken tail lights
Earthquakes on silver lakes
False dreams, yeah, I can hear the heartbreak
Malibu, we cruising, the cops come, we lose 'em
You know how we do it and this life I'm using
We out here in East LA
'Bout to start a little shit down on PCH
Whatever happened to my favorite place?
Running red lights, never touched the brakes
I used to have my own map to the stars
Wouldn't you know, the stars were open scars
I wouldn't have it any other way
And I don't give a fuck come Judgment Day

Where's LA? Where's LA? Where's LA?
Whatever happened to the city we knew?
Where's LA? Where's LA? Where's LA?
Whatever happened to the city we knew?

Tell my mother, my brothers, my father, and others
I'll be gone till November with LA, my lover
Tell my mother, my brothers, my father, and others
I'll be gone till November with Los Angeles, my lover
Hold your sons, your daughters, the sand, the water
We are California, like no other

Where's LA? Where's LA? Where's LA?
Whatever happened to the city we knew?
Where's LA? Where's LA? Where's LA?
Whatever happened to the city we knew?
