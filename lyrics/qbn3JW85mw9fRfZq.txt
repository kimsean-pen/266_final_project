Charlie never had to get too hot
Just try sticking with the girl you got
Other women they would seem secure
They're just as fragile as her

I heard Sanders in a new good space
She found Johnny in the strangest place
At the back of the hotel downtown
Blood on the side of his mouth

Is there anything that I can do
All my sympathy it went to you
I heard you were looking so strung out
Smiling and tumbling down

The seasons will change
The things you perceive
The company will keep disturbing your sleep

It's so much better in the sunlight
I'm just a little mirage
It's so much better in the sunlight
I'm just a little mirage
It's so much better in the sunlight
I'm just a little mirage
It's so much better in the sunlight
I'm just a little mirage

Oh, oh
