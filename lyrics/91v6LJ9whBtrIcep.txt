Flyin' me back to Memphis
Gotta find my Daisy Jane
Well, the summer's gone
And I hope she's feelin' the same
Well, I left her just to roam the city
Thinkin' it would ease the pain
I'm a crazy man
And I'm playin' my crazy game, game
Does she really love me
I think she does
Like the stars above me
I know because
When the sky is bright
Everything's alright
Flyin' me back to Memphis
Honey, keep the oven warm
All the clouds are clearin'
And I think we're over the storm
Well, I've been pickin' it up around me
Daisy, I think I'm sane
And I'm awful glad
And I guess you're really to blame, blame
Do you really love me
I hope you do
Like the stars above me
How I love you
When it's cold at night
Everything's alright
Does she really love me
I think she does
Like the stars above me
I know because
When the sky is bright
Everything's alright
