What you say, Mr lovable, hey, Mr lova-lovable
What you say, Mr got it all, hey, Mr got it-got it all
We got the disco love, so fun and colorful
It's never winter when it's Donna Summer all year long
You take me back in time, to 1979
We'll be like the Bee Gees, baby everybody staying alive

Oh, is it love that's in the air? Baby baby baby
Oh, feel the chemistry in here, baby baby baby
Boy you make me feel so fine
Boy you make me feel so good
Boy you make me feel so right, baby baby baby
Oh, is it love that's in the air? Baby baby baby

What you say, Mr doable, hey, Mr doa-doable
Got me wanting the physical, hey, the physi-physical
We got the disco love, so fun and colorful
It's never winter when it's Donna Summer all year long
You take me back in time, to 1999
We hear the DJ playing 'Hit Me Baby One More Time'

Oh, is it love that's in the air? Baby baby baby
Oh feel the chemistry in here, baby baby baby
Boy you make me feel so fine
Boy you make me feel so good
Boy you make me feel so right, baby baby baby
Oh is it love that's in the air? Baby baby baby

Shh shh shh shake me if I'm dreaming
Shh shh shh shake me if I'm dreaming
Shh shh shh shake me if I'm dreaming
Shake me, baby baby baby

Oh, is it love that's in the air? Baby baby baby
Oh, feel the chemistry in here, baby baby baby
Boy you make me feel so fine
Boy you make me feel so good
Boy you make me feel so right, baby baby baby
Oh, is it love that's in the air? Baby baby baby

Come on come on
Come on come on
Baby baby baby

Come on come on

Baby baby baby
