When you were younger i was always on you mind.
The thought of future let the tears roll off your eyes.

Feel it in my blood, in my eyes, in my dreams
Still, its on my mind.

Wondering about all the lives i won't lead
Taking up my mind.

If i could change the world i'd probably run and hide.
But then again there's so much i would realise.

Feel it in my blood, in my eyes, in my dreams
Still, its on my mind.

Wondering about all the lives i won't lead
Taking up my mind.

(Lying all the time
Still its on my mind
Lying all the time)

When you were younger i was always on you mind.

(Still its on my mind
Lying all the time
Still its on my mind)

But then again there's so much i would realise.

Hmm...
