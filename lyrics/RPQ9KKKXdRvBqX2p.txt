I've got seven ways of going, seven wheres to be,
seven sweet disguises, seven ways of serving Thee.
Lord, I do extol Thee, for Thou has lifted me.
Woke me up and shook me out of mine iniquity.
Oh, I was undulating in the lewd impostered night.
Steeped in a dream to rend the seams to redeem the rock of right.

Swept through the seas of Galilee and the Seven Hills of Rome.
Seven sins were wrung from the sight of me,
lo I turned my neck toward home.
Ah, I opened up my arms to You, and we spun from life to life,
'til you loosened me and let me go toward the everlasting light.

In this big step I am taking seven seizures for the true.
I got seven ways of going, seven ways of serving You.

As I move thru seven levels
As I move upon the slate
As I declare to you
The number of my moves
As I speculate the eighth
Seeking love without exception
A light upon the swarm
Seeking love without exception
A saint in any form.
