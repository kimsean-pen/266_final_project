She could be
Easy to find you see
She writes her songs
Only for you to sing

She digs the words
Out of the sky
She leaves them there
For you to find

The way that you love dear
The fate of the world you leave behind
A way to the future
Making a moment built to last
You want to love, well
Now's your chance

You hear the beat
Over the radio
You see the scene
A satellite picture show

You take her words
Out of the sky
She left them there
For you to find

The way that you love dear
The fate of the world you leave behind
A way to the future
Making a moment built to last
You want to love, well
Now's your chance

The way that you love dear
The fate of the world you leave behind
A way to the future
Making a moment built to last
You want to love, well
Now's your chance
