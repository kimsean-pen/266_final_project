Here I wanna be a stranger
Drift in and then out just linger
Slow motion you fall
Like a blossom
Way out there on a star
Nova lazy

Life, love,
Just in ...?
Life, love,

Write it down but
Don't send the letter
When it shines it's forever
Here I wanna be a stranger
Way out there on a star
Nova lazy

Life, love,
just in ...?
Life, love,
