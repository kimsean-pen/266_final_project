your eyes shining with the stars
laying out in your backyard
i won't ever sleep tonight i swear

bc that's when you come to me
as i'm drifting into dreams
i can barely close my eyes i swear

it's always the same thing

you've been hanging in my brain
causing all my stomach aches
i can only think of you these days

it's always the same thing

you've been spending all your time
living on the backside of my eyes
sleeping pills won't clear my mind no way
i've been spending all my time
looking at the backside of my eyes
and you're the one i always find there babe

it's always the same thing

fill my head with pillow talk
i've been feeling low too long
i need to hear your voice a while my love

i just miss the way you taste
when you're hardly still awake
lying next to me, i'll let you have my love

it's always the same thing

you've been spending all your time
living on the backside of my eyes
sleeping pills won't clear my mind no way
i've been spending all my time
looking at the backside of my eyes
and you're the one i always find there babe

it's always the same thing
it's always the same thing
it's always the same thing
