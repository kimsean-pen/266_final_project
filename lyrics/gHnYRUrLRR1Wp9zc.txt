What happened America
I've been working three jobs just to pay my bills
Working three jobs just to pay my bills
If it don't stop me nothing will
If it don't stop me nothing will
I've been knocking on the door since ninety four
But they still won't let me in
And what they tell you
They say
Everybody glows when then down on their knees
When they get down on their knees

What you gonna do
What you gonna do
Come on
What you gonna do
A little harder
A little louder
A little harder
A little louder
A little harder
A little louder
A little harder
A little louder

I've been working so hard just to get ahead
But they still won't let me live
They say it's two miles to go but I already know
There will be two more when I finish
[?] she already a saint oh she's ready to sing
Oh but I told her (what you tell her)
You gonna drown out there swimming all alone
You better get on the winning team
What you gonna do

What you gonna do
What you gonna do
Come on
What you gonna do
A little harder
A little louder
A little harder
A little louder
A little harder
A little louder
A little harder
A little louder

Keep on
Keep on Keep on Keep on
Keep on pushing you gotta
Keep on moving
Keep on Keep on
Keep on pushing
You gotta keep on moving
You gotta keep on pushing
You gotta keep it moving

Mm mmm
Come
Just, just
You gotta
Keep on pushing
Keep moving
Keep moving
Keep moving
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on pushing
