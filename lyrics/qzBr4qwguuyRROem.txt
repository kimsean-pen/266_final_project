And the weird city girl says "love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me"
And the lawnmower girl says "breathe me, breathe me
Breathe me, breathe me, be me, be me"

There's a fizzy little girl gettin' nearer, nearer
Nearer, nearer, nearer, nearer
And a horse-headed girl says "join me, join me
Join me, join me, join me, join me"

I'll eat the flowers that you're blowin' in my direction
I have to say that you're blurring my day
I like the flowers that you're blowin' in my direction
I have to say that you're blurring my day
