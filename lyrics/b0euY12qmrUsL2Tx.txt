I see the morning sun although my eyes are shut
I'm in somebody's bed, I wonder what I said
She reaches out for me, but I'm 32 degrees
There is nothing to say, I just want to escape

Well I never wanted love
It always seemed too much
Words born a lonely one
With a bad broken toe
And even though I never try
It finds me every time
We fall right back in line
You tie your hands to mine

You tie your hands to mine
You tie your hands to mine

I wake up on a drive, I see a stranger sky
Don't speak to anyone, cover myself in blood
I get lonely again, something I can't resist
I want you in my game, I want to say your name

Well I never wanted love
It always seemed too much
Words born a lonely one
With a bad broken toe
And even though I never try
It finds me every time
We fall right back in line
You tie your hands to mine

You tie your hands to mine
You tie your hands to mine

I see the morning sun although my eyes are shut
I'm in somebody's bed, I wonder what I said
She reaches out for me, but I'm 32 degrees
There is nothing to say, I just want to escape

Well I never wanted love
It always seemed too much
Words born a lonely one
With a bad broken toe
And even though I never try
It finds me every time
Words born a lonely one
With a bad broken toe
I never wanted love
It always seemed too much
Words born a lonely one
With a bad broken toe
And even though I never try
It finds me every time
We fall right back in line
You tie your hands to mine

You tie your hands to mine
You tie your hands to mine
You tie your hands to mine
You tie your hands to mine
You tie your hands to mine
You tie your hands to mine
You tie your hands to mine
You tie your hands to mine
You tie your hands to mine
You tie your hands to mine
You tie your hands to mine
You tie your hands to mine
