Hey Rose
It's nice to meet you
I've been a fan for a long damn time
I know, I don't mean to scare you
Just need a second of your time

Love might make me bad tonight
Love might make me bad tonight

Come on, Rose
Don't you get me? Don't you, Rose?
Please, come on, Rose
Won't you let me take you home?
Love might make me bad tonight
Come on, Rose
Won't you let me take you home?

Hello Sir
It's nice to meet you
I'm just caught off guard
Sounds nice
I can't tonight
Let's get a picture I can sign

Come on, Rose
Don't you get me? Don't you, Rose?
Please, come on, Rose
Won't you let me take you home?
Love might make me bad tonight
Come on, Rose
Won't you let me take you home?

Please, come on, Rose

Please, come on, Rose

Keep waiting for tears
It's been a year but not a damn thing's changed
I couldn't say hi last time
That's why you don't remember me
I only wanna talk and maybe touch
If you would let me touch
Just a second of your time
But never mind, I don't want to scare you

Come on, Rose
Won't you let me take you home?
Love might make me bad tonight

Come on, Rose
Don't you get me? Don't you, Rose?
Please, come on, Rose
Won't you let me take you home?
Love might make me bad tonight
Come on, Rose
Won't you let me take you home?

Please, come on, Rose
Don't you get me? Don't you, Rose?
Please, come on, Rose
Won't you let me take you home?
Love might make me bad tonight
Come on, Rose

Hey, Rose
