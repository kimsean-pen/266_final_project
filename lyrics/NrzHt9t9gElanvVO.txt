Breaking in, all the answers I've lost
All of... More than efforts here you sat
Making a noose out of everything you use
You use everyone directly out of sight

When you don't have to make my eye
(I'm afraid of the day it will never come)
I don't know if I can

Turn this away, censor every word I say
I shed nothing but this lie when I believe
Not long to there, but I can't go where you've been
Buried all on top the energy we create

There's a strain on my eye
When you're standing too close to what you want

When you don't have to make my eye
(I'm afraid of the day it will never come)
I don't know if I can
(I'm afraid of the day it will never come)
By the time this dream is tearing us apart
When you get what you want?

I feel it in the air
(I know a way out)
I know it's in there
(I won't leave you there)

(You know) it's just a God that we can lie to
It's just an antiquated position
(You know) it's just a silent need for action
Take it is a compliment to a let down

Let's just keep calling me absent
Its just an antiquated position
(You know) It's just a silent need for action
Take it is a compliment to a let down
