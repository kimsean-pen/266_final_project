Drunk drive to my apartment
Let's pick up where we started
Let's leave off where we left it
Meet me at the apartment

Let's break up, make out, make up
Just pretend we're fine
'Cause I know you miss me
And I'm always on your mind, mind

But if you want me, why can't we still be together?
You've got problems, but I promise they'll get better
We both know that I can't wait on you forever
I still wonder if we're meant to be together

Meet me at Union Station
Let's play guitar in your basement
Let's get Ramen Takeya
Let's talk about our problems

Let's break up, make out, make up
Just pretend we're fine
'Cause I know you miss me
And I'm always on your mind, mind

But if you want me, why can't we still be together?
You've got problems, but I promise they'll get better
We both know that I can't wait on you forever
I still wonder if we're meant to be together

If you want me, why can't we be together? Together
If you want me, why can't we be together? Together
If you want me, why can't we be together? Together
If you want me, why can't we be together? Together
