You're a cool little one
My dark southern breeze
Sweeps through my fingers
And it amazes me
Dixie shadow land
Your envy shelters me
Lay down your burden
Mystery of ebony

And it amazes me
Oh, it amazes me
Maybe the heat babe
Could be this tune
It amazes me
It amazes me
What drives me crazy
Is that big fat yellow moon

Look up, that pale light
Well, she's waking the trees
I'm drifting into your hoodoo
And it amazes me
That Magnolia state
Ooh, got a hold on me
I got no blues to preach
Just the Mississippi company

And it amazes me
Oh, it amazes me
Maybe the heat babe
Could be this tune
It amazes me
It amazes me
What drives me crazy
Is that big fat yellow moon
And it amazes me

Ain't no magic potion
No grigri on her side
She's a bound to my salvation
Sweet little mama
Take me down by the river tonight
And it amazes me

And it amazes me
It amazes me
Maybe the heat babe
Could be this tune
It amazes me
Oh, it amazes me
What drives me crazy
Is that big fat yellow moon
And it amazes me
