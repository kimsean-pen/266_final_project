I wanna kiss you in the middle of a party
I wanna cause a scene
I want everyone to know that you were with me
We'll dance to our own beat

And I don't care if anybody's watching me

When I'm homesick
I go to the supermarket
I buy all the things I think my mom would get

Why did I buy four apricots?
I'll never eat them before they rot
They'll just become an afterthought
