Love is like a Ramblin' Rose
The more you feed it
The more it grows,
Ramblin'Rose, Ramblin'Rose,
Come on home

Ramblin' Rose,
Is such a ball
Diamond rings
And a Cadillac car,
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Come on home

Ramblin' Rose
Ramblin' around,
Ramblin' Rose
I'm gonna put you down
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Come on home

Love is like a Ramblin' Rose
The more you feed it,
The more it grows
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Come on home

I need a Ramblin' Rose
Ramblin' Rose
(repeat 'til end)
