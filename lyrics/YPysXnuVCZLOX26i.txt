Take a photo
Put it in your pocket
Promise you wan't change your ways
Promise I won't stay the same
Just relax
Time will pass if you let it go
Sifting through your sorrows
It won't get you anywhere

And I don't want to let a moment pass
Running circles in my mind, circles in my mind
And I don't want to let a moment pass
Running circles in my mind, circles in my mind

"Call you later"
Something that you forget
Waiting on the dial tone
Maybe I'll just let it go
Here I am
Been waiting on you for too long
Maybe we should call it quits
But you never gave a shit

And I don't want to let a moment pass
Running circles in my mind, circles in my mind
And I don't want to let a moment pass
Running circles in my mind, circles in my mind

And I don't want to let a moment pass
Running circles in my mind, circles in my mind
And I don't want to let a moment pass
Running circles in my mind, circles in my mind
