I don't even need to go to the club no more
I just need you here with me on this floor
You ain't gotta worry about a thing at all
Just take a chance, grab my hand

Now let's dance
I can feel it in my heart when I'm close to you
We ain't really got nothing here to lose
I just wanna bounce baby bounce, bounce, bounce
'Cause you know this right here is what
I'm talking about, talking about

We've been in this for some time
You're the type of girl that's always there to hold me down
When it comes to love you give it all
'Cause with you it's like I got a friend come rise and fall
That's why we flow like melodies
Mmmmm
Who needs words? Not us, cuz we be in L-O-V-E

Like a beautiful harmony

Fit together so perfectly
I don't even need to go to the club no more

I just need you here with me on this floor
You ain't gotta worry about a thing at all
Just take a chance, grab my hand
Now let's dance
I can feel it in my heart when I'm close to you

I just wanna bounce baby bounce, bounce, bounce
