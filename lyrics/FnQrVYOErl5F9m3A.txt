I'm thinking about other things I heard about today
All this week and tomorrow
And how these hands could create some better things for bettering
But you see for now I got my own things
I can't help it
I got too many issues I own
So I cannot help I'm afraid, yeah
But keep on preaching, preaching and heal the world
Lip service makes us look great

Do you feel
The weight of the world singing sorrow
Or to you is it just not real
Cause you've got your own things
Yeah we all have our things I guess

I guess my mind wanders off
From time to time
Sometimes I convince myself
That all is fine in the world
It's not mine
Why should I have to try
To fix things I didn't create or contrive

Do you feel
The weight of the world singing sorrow
Or to you is it just not real
Cause you've got your own things
Yeah we all have so many things

Have the habits had you
Has it been for long
Can you feel the souls behind what's going on

Do you feel
The weight of the world singing sorrow
Or to you is it just not real
Cause you've got your own things
Yeah we all have our things

Do you feel
The weight of the world singing sorrow
Or to you is it just not real
Cause you've got your own things
Cause we all have so many things
And I can get past these things

Ohh
