Cause now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Cause Johnny's come back
To me

Oh when Judy left with Johnny at my party (my party)
And came back wearing his ring
I sat down and cried my eyes
Now that was a foolish thing

Cause now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Cause Johnny's come back
To me

Well it hurt me so to see them dance together (together)
I felt like making a scene
Then my tears just felt like rain drops
Cause Judy's smile was so mean

But now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Cause Johnny's come back
To me

Oh one night I saw them kissing at a party (a party)
So I kissed some other guy
Johnny jumped up and hit him
Cause he still loved me that's why

So now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Cause Johnny's come back
To me
Yay now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Cause Johnny's come back
To me
