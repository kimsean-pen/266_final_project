You must philosophies
But why must you bore me to tears?
You're red around the eyes
You tell me things no one else hears

You spend all your time crying
Crying the hours in tears
Crying the hours in tears
Come lend your time to me

And you will know that you are free
And when you look at me
Don't think you're owning what you see
For remember that you're free

And that's what you want to be
So just lend your time to me

You must philosophies
But why must you bore me to tears?
You're red around the eyes
You tell me things no one else hears

You spend all your time crying
Crying the hours in tears
Crying the hours in to ears
