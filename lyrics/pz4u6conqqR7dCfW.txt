I ain't gonna worry about tomorrow
Gonna let every day stand on its own
I don't worry about tomorrow
Gonna let every day stand on its own
You know tomorrow still be here
And we could all be dead and gone

I ain't gonna worry about you, baby
I ain't gonna worry no more
I ain't gonna worry about you, baby
Lord Lord Lord, I ain't gonna worry no more

Seems like you don't want me, woman
And I know that now I got to go
I know that now I got to go, yes I do

I ain't gonna worry no more, baby
You know that I done paid my dues
I ain't gonna worry about you, baby
Now you know that I done paid my dues
And now that you don't want me, baby
It's just me, my guitar and the blues
Me, my guitar and the blues

I'm leaving you, baby
