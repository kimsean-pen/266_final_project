Oooh baby, oooh baby

When we're out in the moon light
Lookin' up on the stars above
Feels so good when I'm near you
Holdin' hands and makin' love

Oooh baby, yes oh baby
Yes oh baby, yes oh baby

Sandy beach, was makin' love
As a tide moves in on us
Feels so good walking side by side
Wanna be with you all my life

Oooh baby, yes oh baby
Yes oh baby, yes oh baby

Dreams of you all the time
Feels so good when we're together love
Just can't wait until tomorrow night
Hey baby let's shake it

Oh hey baby, hey hey baby
Yes oh baby, yes oh baby

When we're out in the moon light
Lookin' up on the stars above
Feels so good when I'm near you
Holdin' hands and makin' love

Oooh baby, yes oh baby
Yes oh baby, yes oh baby

Yes oh baby

Ooh baby, ooh baby

Sandy beach, was makin' love
As a tide moves in on us
Feels so good walkin' side by side
Wanna be with you all my life

Oooh baby, yes oh baby
Yes oh baby, yes oh baby
