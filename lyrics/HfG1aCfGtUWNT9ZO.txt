Why does it hurt so bad?
Why do I feel so sad?
Thought I was over you
But I keep crying when I don't love you

So, why does it hurt so bad?
I thought I had let you go
So, why does it hurt me so?
I gotta get you outta my head
It hurts so bad, oh, it hurts so bad, babe

My life's been better since the day I left you boy
I must admit life's been kind to me
I went and did the things I said, "I would do, boy"
I found someone who loves me for me, yeah yeah

Haven't had much drama since the day that we split, boy
My heart's never been more at ease
And when I think of all the things you put me through
Leaving you has been the best thing for me

So why does it hurt so bad?
Why do I feel so sad?
I thought I was over you
But I keep crying when I don't love you

So, why does it hurt so bad?
Baby, I thought, I had let you go
So, why does it hurt me so?
I gotta get you outta my head
Hurts me so bad

Hurts so
(Yeah, you do)
Hurts so
(Hurts me so)
Hurts so bad
(Did you know)
(That it hurts me so)
Hurts so

(So bad, hey hoh)

Never again that's what I said to myself
I never wanna feel kind of pain again boy, hey
Just when I think it's over, just when I think it's through
I find myself right back in love with you

So, why does it hurt so bad? Oh baby
Why do I feel so sad?
(Thought I, thought I)
Thought I was over you

I keep crying
When I don't love you
(When I really don't love you, boy)
