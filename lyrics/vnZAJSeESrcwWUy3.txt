I held up a liquor store
Demanded top-shelf metaphors
With a sinner's smile and open arms
Drop a line to charm the silent alarm
Heard neutral angels call the cops
They'll be choosing sides when the fighting stops
Polizie in the cabaret
While we six kings made our getaway
Thick as thieves
On our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves
On our knees
With an ocean in between
Laughter in the darkness
I heard whispers in the shadows
I was there when the wall fell down
I'll be there when the ocean rises
Building castles with cans and bottles
Drinking like they do in novels
I know they'll get me by and by
But tonight you are my alibi
The same old sun
that we all come from
Faded stars
in the air that we breath, in the earth, in the sea
Thick as thieves
On our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves
On our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves
On our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves
On our knees
With an ocean in between
