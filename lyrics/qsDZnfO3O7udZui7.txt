Backwards and forwards
Seems always undercovers
They blind us all
Pressed against the wall
There's nothing that you should fear
Autopilot behind the wheel

Don't fret they're coming
They're lining up to join me
To save us all
Which ones will fall
They don't even care we're here
How do you save someone without fear

The voices screaming
Stop!
Look what we've started
The heroes falling
Could you say that you would give your life tonight?
The sky is burning
The fear consuming
I'll live forever if I lose my life tonight

Tensions are boiling
To the point of overflowing
The stage is set
Curtains drenched in red
We sent off our only sons
We're killing them one by one
Best friends and lovers
Turn against one another
Their faces change
Only shame remains
Out here we stand alone
Operation "Come Back Home"

The voices screaming
Stop!
Look what we've started
The heroes falling
Could you say that you would give your life tonight?
The sky is burning
The fear consuming
I'll live forever if I lose my life tonight

I'll live forever if I lose my life tonight

The voices screaming
Stop!
Look what we've started
The heroes falling
Could you say that you would give your life tonight?
The sky is burning
The fear consuming
I'll live forever if I lose my life tonight

Look what we've started
The heroes falling
I'll live forever if I lose my life tonight
The sky is burning
The fear consuming
I'll live forever if I lose my life tonight

I'll live forever if I lose my life tonight
