He made a record
It made him famous, yes, it made him a star
The life and soul of the party
He rocks and he shocks

(You never know where you are with him)

He got no sense, but he got money
He got no sense, but he got overnight success

Exceed excess, exceed excess

He no big deal, he just a wide boy
He no big deal, he just an ordinary guy
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my

He made a movie
He played the driver of a big yellow car
He is super fab and groovy
He struts and he crows

(You never know where you are with him)

He got no sense, but he got money
He got no sense, but he got overnight success

Exceed excess, exceed excess

He no big deal, he just a wide boy
He no big deal, he just an ordinary guy
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my

And with your symmetry teeth
And your California tan, well
I'm here to tell you that you ain't no Superman
You just a wide boy (wide boy)
