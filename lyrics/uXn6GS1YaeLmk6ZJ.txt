Get on your knees and let the games begin
Bow to your queen and I will crown your head
Cause I can make you every inch a king
Before I do it
Tell me
Tell me what's in it for me

I need someone young, willing, and able
You need someone old enough to know better
I want you to
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
(Yeah come on)
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work

Let me be your labor of love
My royal guard don't need to hire men
Plant your seed
Darlin
My roses are in your hands

I need someone young, willing, and able
You need someone old enough to know better
I want you to
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
(Yeah come on)

Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
(Yeah come on)

Do my dirty work
Do my dirty work
(Yeah)
Do my dirty work
(Yeah)
Do my dirty work
(Yeah)
Do my dirty work
(Yeah)
Do my dirty work
(Come on)
Do my dirty work
(Yeah)
Do my dirty work
