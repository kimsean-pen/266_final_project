In the cold, cold night
Lying next to you almost made it feel alright
And when we talked, I was just blown by
I told you all, all about my life
At one point, I even cried

It's all in your eyes
Yet I still need some time

Before we burn eachother up
Before we lose our minds
Before I'm not enough, for you
Baby I need some time
Before you break my heart
Oh before we need to talk
Before we even start something
I'm sorry I need to go

I was lost and found
Like that lonely glove nobody cares about
But you saw, something worth having
You picked me up, [?] on my heart's strings
But I'm still cold inside

Baby we can try
'Cause I went down the line
But I still need some time

Before we burn eachother up
Before we lose our minds
Before I'm not enough, for you
Baby I need some time
Before you break my heart
Oh before we need to talk
Before we even start, all I'm saying is
I'm sorry I need to go
Oh I'm sorry I need to go

I am just a ghost, tryna' stay alive
Still I'm holding on to another life
You heard me howling
You said let's take it slow
But I'm still fighting
I can't seem to let her go
Though I could see her eyes
It only hurts my eyes right now
I don't wanna lie
I still need some time

Before we burn eachother up
Before we lose our minds
Before I'm not enough, for you
Baby I need some time
Before you break my heart
Oh before we need to talk
Before we even start, what I'm saying is
I'm sorry I need to go
Oh I'm sorry I need to go
