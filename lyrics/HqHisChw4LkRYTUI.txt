let me through
paper and fist
jessica numbers tell me if
we're clear
write me a storm
just tape the letter to the door

this thing is your mission
the lone wish and condition

brave another road
jessica numbers to the wall
slip through
ever the thief
is posed to hero but we'll see

this thing is your mission
the lone wish and condition

push me through
counting the lies
measuring all our shadows by
old star
shift into red
just stick the numbers to the bed

hairchipping up
the sadness as it passes
as word across
the window frosting out
starting to feel the kicking here at last yeah
something worth keeping around

let me through
paper and fist
jessica numbers give me this
let's fall
look where we land
just write the answer on my hand

this thing is your mission
the lone wish and condition

jessica numbers how we do
jessica numbers how we do
jessica numbers how we do
