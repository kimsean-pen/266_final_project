See, these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon, it's been so long

Feel my blood enraged
It's just the fear of losing you
Don't you know my name
Well, you've been so long
And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline!

See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long

Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through

You've been so long
Well, it's been so long
I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire with gasoline

See, these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
Tears can never dry
A judgment made can never bend

See, these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe
What I've been through

Well, you've been so long, it's been so long
And I've been putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out fire, I've been putting out fire

Well, it's been so long so long so long
Yes, it's been so long so long so long
(I've been putting out fire)
Been so long so long so long

(And putting out fire)
Been so long so long so long
(Yeah, yeah, putting out fire)
Been so long so long so long

(Been putting out fire)
Been so long so long so long
(Yeah, putting out fire)
Been so long so long so long

(Putting out fire)
Been so long so long so long
(It's been so long)
Been so long so long so long

(It's been so long)
Been so long so long so long
(And I've been putting out fire)
Been so long so long so long
(I've been putting out fire)
