On an island, stuck together
You're the vinyl I could play forever
Down a mountain, through the desert
Chase the water and change the weather

You remind me of a soundtrack
From a movie, a throwback
Don't keep me waiting, don't make me wonder
Don't alert me about the spoiler

You got this sweetness
My body needs this
You are my Venus
I'm River Phoenix

Be my rock and never move
I won't dance unless you do
You are my Venus
I'm River Phoenix

Don't you know me? The last crusader
I need a lover. No, not a hater
Let's save the forest, 800 acres
In Costa Rica, I wanna take ya

You got this sweetness
My body needs this
You are my Venus
I'm River Phoenix

Be my rock and never move
I won't dance unless you do
You are my Venus
I'm River Phoenix

Rising like the sun 'til sunset
A shady bar on the boulevard
Rising like the sun 'til sunset
A hazy star, you went too far

Rising, rising like the sun
You are my Venus
I'm River Phoenix
Rising, rising like the sun
You are my Venus
I'm River Phoenix
Be my rock and never move
I won't dance unless you do
Rising, rising like the sun
You are my Venus
I'm River Phoenix
