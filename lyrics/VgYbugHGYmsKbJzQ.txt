My dear Annie
won't you please let me in
I know that I've made some mistakes
I'm so sorry
I was never really there
I'm just so sorry that I never even tried

But you saw through my lies
My endless lies

Take me to a better place
where I can breathe the air
where I can smile
This house is getting smaller
and the blinds are all shut
Please help me to smile

I know that I've made some mistakes
But I'm only a man
and i'm sorry, so sorry
I can't let you in
Just a shell of a man
There's no more of me to give

But it's not going to finish,
it's not going to stop.
I'm not going to throw in the towel.
I'm gonna fix myself
one day at a time.
I won't hurt you no more
I just can't hurt you no more.

Let me, let me, let me, why won't you let me in
Just let me breathe again
Because I'm not okay, no i'm not alright
I hope that you're doing just fine

Let me go
You saw through my lies, my endless lies
But you never let me go
Just f**king let me go, trust me you deserve better
Just f**king let me go, I'm just no good for you anymore

My dear Annie
won't you please let me in
I know that I've made some mistakes
I'm so sorry, but I tried and I tried
It was never enough for you

Let me, let me, let me, why won't you let me in
Just let me breathe again
Because I'm not okay, no i'm not alright
I hope that you're doing just fine

Because I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
But it wasn't enough
I promise I'll fix this one day at a time
Just don't forget me
Just please don't forget me
