Oh no! I am lacking
I want what I see.
You, fireball, have rolled away and shaded valleys.
So here I am the creekbed,
So here I feel my way in the dark
What wonder?
What treasure map?
What breaking of day?
What stream used to flow here, and now what dusty decay?
Let the flash flood begin.
Wash me down the canyon.
Quicksand pull me in!
Blow over me solar wind!
(La-da-da-da...)
You're vultures in trees.
I know you're out there
You're lanterns on lakes.
I know you're out there
You're soccer balls on knees,
And through your skirt I see,
Your legs gracefully,
I know you're out there
You're swaying and pleased
I know you're out there
You're vultures in trees,
I know you're out there
You're vultures in trees
I know you're out there
Your mountainous peaks
Don't let gravity win
Blow over me solar wind
I know you're out there
