As long as I'm breathin' I'll breathe for you
I need you, my love
And if you can't dream, then I'll dream for two
I need you, my love
I'm alone in thought of only you for days
I'm just tryin' to keep my head above the waves

And they say it's never as deep as the first time
It's never as sweet as the first time you fall, fall
And they say, it's never as complete as the first time
But you're never gonna bleed like the first time you fall, fall

Little by little I've realized you were not the one
Now I'm not seein' the same eyes that showed me the sun
I've been holding on too long, thought you would change
I've been holding on, I don't want you to break

And they say it's never as deep as the first time
It's never as sweet as the first time you fall, fall
And they say, it's never as complete as the first time
But you're never gonna bleed like the first time you fall, fall

Woke up this morning
Feel like I was split down the middle of my heart
Don't know if you noticed
But there's a hole in the middle, a dark star
And I remember the way your rain hit me there
Hit me so hard
I'll never be the same again

And they say it's never as deep as the first time
It's never as sweet as the first time you fall, fall
And they say, it's never as complete as the first time
But you're never gonna bleed like the first time you fall, fall
