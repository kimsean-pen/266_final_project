Look around
Look around, there's no affection only infection
Search yourself
Search yourself, can I depend on you to surrender?

And we will storm their shores
Eyes suffocating all they see
Feet sturdy on the rubble that will soon be dust
And there will be no ruins
No memory, no history
Only our unrelenting march
Side by side we will comb the earth and sweep it clean
Hearts and feet unified
The hand of man is no match for our warless army

Please tell me that this is the end of the world (and we will strike with the arms of gods)
It's time that we erase history (and leave nothing in our wake)
Without a trace or a memory (and we will strike with the arms of gods)
(On my word we will seize fate)
Please tell me that this is the end of the world (and we will strike with the arms of gods)
It's time that we erase history (and leave nothing in our wake)
Without a trace or a memory (and we will strike with the arms of gods)
(Destiny choked in our wage)

Steadfast soldiers with hands of gods
And the numbers to succeed
We will persist until all that's left is a perfect sphere
Never a break in the chain
Never a folly of conviction
And may the traitors' ashes
Seal the barren landscape

We are the end
We are the end

Please tell me that this is the end of the world (and we will strike with the arms of gods)
It's time that we erase history (and leave nothing in our wake)
Without a trace or a memory (and we will strike with the arms of gods)
(On my word we will seize fate)
Please tell me that this is the end of the world (and we will strike with the arms of gods)
It's time that we erase history (and leave nothing in our wake)
Without a trace or a memory (and we will strike with the arms of gods)
(Destiny choked in our wage)

Look around
Look around, there's no affection only infection
Search yourself
Search yourself, can I depend on you to surrender?
Can I depend on you to surrender?

Please tell me that this is the end of the world (and we will strike with the arms of gods)
