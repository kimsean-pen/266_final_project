Say your piece, for I'll be on my way
One last look, nothing left to say
As I turn my back, to walk away
I shall forgive but I won't forget that day

For every sky that shines
Shall meet the pouring rain
For my will shall never break though it may bend
Like the scars that heal yet never mend

When lies become the truth, well, you've got your beliefs
No burdens on your mind, they're buried beneath your feet
As I turn my back, to walk away
I shall forgive but I won't forget that day

For every sky that shines
Shall meet the pouring rain
For my will shall never break though it may bend
Like the scars that heal yet never mend

For every sky that shines
Shall meet the pouring rain
For my will shall never break though it may bend
Like the scars that heal yet never mend

For every sky that shines
Shall meet the pouring rain
For my will shall never break though it may bend
Like the scars that heal yet never mend
