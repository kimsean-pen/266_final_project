I said hey you, perfectly on queue
at the end of the night, as I recall
I said hey babe, when you walked my way you
caught me on fire
save me the time,
I'll save you the trouble
when you've had enough
and I can't take it anymore
something about her, when she said hello
I'm taking you home
I'd rather burn fast than let it burn slow

So let it burn, let it burn baby burn
Let it burn fast, yeah

I sang Hey Jude, perfectly out of tune
by the end of the drive, but got a little lost
you won't lie to me, cause every memory
we'll set em on fire
something about her, when she said hello
I'm taking you home,
I'd rather burn fast than let it burn slow

So let it burn, let it burn baby burn
Let it burn fast, yeah

She said don't think its time for us to change,
So shake my hand for it's too late,

So let it burn, let it burn, let it burn
I'd rather burn fast than let it burn slow

So let it burn, let it burn baby burn
Let it burn fast, yeah

Don't think it's time for us to change,
So shake my hand for its too late
