Since when did you become so cold
And such a lifeless piece of work?
I can't take the sound of you anymore
Or the thought of you

Don't worry
Take what you need
I left you and your dying breed
But before we forget
When the lights burn out
Don't come home crying to me
I will
Surrender myself
For the better health
Of someone who really cares

Why would you throw it away so fast?
It's gotta get better than this
Too hard for too long
I'm holdin' on
Try to go but it just don't feel right
This light
Your eyes
I'm easy
I should've known better by now
But you look so damn good

Go get your black dress, baby
And put your dancin' shoes on
Go get your black dress, baby
And put your dancin' shoes on

I swear to God
My intentions were gold
I swear to God
My intentions were gold

Run away
From your mistakes
Just like the ones you hid from me
Why can't you see that
I was expecting this all along?

The road is long
Where's the light?
I'm tired of walking alone
Alone
Alone
Alone
Alone

I hope you know
I hope you know
I left you long before you left me
I hope you know
I hope you know
I left you long before you left me
Time's up
