devise a plan to make your life easier,
taking time to lose your mind.
your friends become uglier than before,
talking down at their pleasure.
what do you expect from the same thing when it's still devoid of
anything worth trying? so still avoid it.
don't try so hard to be so kind, you might just find
that being mean is worth the time.
it seems wrong, takes a while.
it makes sense when everything is getting stale.
what do you expect from the same thing when it's still devoid of
anything worth trying? so still avoid it.
