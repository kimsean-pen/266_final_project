We know all the words of power
All about the witching hour
We know the reason why you're scared
And here comes your nightmare

Over your shoulder, honey
You don't wanna turn around
Bring the night closer
We are gonna bring you down

It's the times that we live in
Erosion of the mind
Easy to be cruel
Hard to be kind

When the mode of music changes
The walls around the city shake
Look into the face of danger
We know how to make you break

Over your shoulder, honey
Right behind your back
Make you a true believer
Maybe give you heart attack

We are what you made us
See what we can find
Easy to be cruel
Hard to be kind

We can't help the way we feel
We don't want to make a deal
Look out, honey, use your head
Might be murder in your bed

Over your shoulder, honey
The face still shines
Nobody you recognise
Isn't yours, it isn't mine

See the mouth smiling
Make the words rhyme
Easy to be cruel
Hard to be kind
