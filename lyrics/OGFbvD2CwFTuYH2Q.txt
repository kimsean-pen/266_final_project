Someday she'll find you're dumb
The girl with a knife
Somehow she will be close
Girl with a knife
Someday she'll say you're back

A girl with a knife
Till then he'll wait, she'll cry
A girl with a knife

She's falling out of your love
Feeling burned into shape
Fantasies of best friend on
Girl, is that Asian?
You look so alive
Dancing in a crowd of ecstasy
And she seems so alive
Fast away in misery

Someday she'll find you're dumb
The girl with a knife
Somehow she will be close
Girl with a knife
Someday she'll say you're back
A girl with a knife
Till then he'll wait, she'll cry
A girl with a knife
She's falling to decay
With it, my omission
Every thought has gone astray
Where is your religion?
She seems so far
She's going down way into it
She looks so divine
Eyes can really hide the truth

Someday she'll find you're dumb
The girl with a knife
Somehow she will be close
Girl with a knife
Someday she'll say you're back
A girl with a knife
Till then he'll wait, she'll cry
A girl with a knife

If only she could down her play
Somehow, someday
She will be free of the anger
Deep breath away

Someday she'll find you're dumb
The girl with a knife
Somehow she will be close
Girl with a knife
Someday she'll say you're back
A girl with a knife
Till then he'll wait, she'll cry
A girl with a knife
