The more that you hear it
The more that you don't
The lesson is trying
The fear is you won't
Seems they're all winning
You try just to float

It's a constant sound
You're running in the wind
It's a blaze of light
You're motionless
Take back what you put in
You hope it never ends
You hope it never ends

I take it too seriously
To keep ahead of the joke
My fingers keep bending
Still searching for the note
I feel like I'm acting
The fiddler on the boat

It's the ice at dawn
Straight ahead
You wanted to steer
You know you can't
Take back what you put in
You hope it never ends
You hope it never ends
You hope it never ends

Are we looking for answers
Or just filling in the holes?
The problem with living
Is one day you won't
Major to minor
With a slow beating pulse

And forever chords
You learned as a kid
That endless hope
Of all that lies ahead
Could never get old
Stop living in your head
Chase the moments of bliss
They'll outshine the bad
If you believe you can be loved
You'll outlive your past
And you hope it never ends
You hope it never ends
I hope it never ends
I hope it never ends
