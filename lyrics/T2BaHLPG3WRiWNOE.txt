Sh-sh-shakedown
It's the start of something great now
Here comes the shakedown

I've had this image in my head
Since I was just a little kid lost in daydreams
Rusting out from all the sweat
But I can see myself for the first time so clearly

Oh, I feel it
Oh, break through the ceiling
Oh, I need it
I won't stop 'cause I remember that feeling

All those nights alone
I faced my fears in the mirror
I found my way to show
Who I am, won't disappear
The scars from the fights that came through the years
Are constant reminders of what got me here
All those nights alone
They were the start of something great now
Here comes the shakedown

Sh-sh-shakedown
It's the start of something great now
Here comes the shakedown

It's hard to count the times I bled
I never told myself that greatness comes easy
Others break, but I won't bend
It took the pain I see for the first time so clearly

Oh, I feel it
Oh, break through the ceiling
Oh, I need it
I won't stop 'cause I remember that feeling

All those nights alone
I faced my fears in the mirror
I found my way to show
Who I am, won't disappear
The scars from the fights that came through the years
Are constant reminders of what got me here
All those nights alone
They were the start of something great now
Here comes the shakedown

Sh-sh-shakedown
It's the start of something great now
Here comes the shakedown
Sh-sh-shakedown
It's the start of something great now
Here comes the shakedown

Sometimes we fall, sometimes we break
Sometimes we're lost in all our mistakes

All those nights alone
I faced my fears in the mirror
I found my way to show
Who I am, won't disappear
The scars from the fights that came through the years
Are constant reminders of what got me here
All those nights alone
They were the start of something great now
Here comes the shakedown

Sh-sh-shakedown
It's the start of something great now
Here comes the shakedown
Sh-sh-shakedown
It's the start of something great now
Here comes the shakedown
