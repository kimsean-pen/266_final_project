I feel out of space
The roads aren't the same
Like they were when you were the one
Driving my car
And now i just count the waves
Of our yesterdays
As i go on the 101 highway
And it's taking me back to the start
We lost everything (everything, everything, everything)
We lost everything
But you'll always be close to my heart
We lost everything (everything, everything, everything)
We lost everything
But you'll always be close to my hope
Ohh, you'll always be close to my heart
Ohh, you'll always be close to my heart

Ohh
You were the sun and moon
Spinning me around
When i pushed, you pulled me closer
So i wouldn't fall down
And now i just count the waves
Of your warm embrace
When you made it a little bit lighter
When i was tumbling into the dark
(In the dark)
(Tumbling into the dark)
We lost everything (everything, everything, everything)
We lost everything
But you'll always be close to my hope
We lost everything
(We lost everything)
But you'll always be close to my heart
Ohh, you'll always be close to my heart
Ohh, you'll always be close to my heart
(You'll always be close to my heart)
