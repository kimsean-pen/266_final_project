WE ARE ALL WE HAVE TONIGHT!

Whoa whoa ohh we are all we have tonight
Whoa whoa ohh we are all we have tonight
Whoa whoa ohh we are all we have tonight

The ones you can't control
Brought together by life twists
Have only one another to depend upon
Displaced from society outcast we are
We have nothing to live up to

WE ARE ALL WE HAVE!
HEY! Loud fast music
HEY! Sweat and dirt
HEY! Sounds from man soul
HEY! Noise of battle
HEY! Black clouds of smoke

HEY! It's time to lose control
COME ON GET UP NOW!
Vengeance with our fists
RIGHT NOW!

Screaming in the air
Whoa whoa ohh we are all we have tonight

Whoa whoa ohh we are all we have tonight
All these joys and sorrow
I gladly sadly bring
This music is all we got
The only place I need
Is drinking here tonight

Together with you all
HEY! Loud fast music
HEY! Sweat and dirt
HEY! Sounds from man soul
HEY! Noise of battle
HEY! Black clouds of smoke

HEY! It's time to lose control
COME ON GET UP NOW!

Vengeance with our fists
RIGHT NOW!
Screaming in the air
Whoa whoa ohh we are all we have tonight

Whoa whoa ohh we are all we have tonight
NOW!
Vengeance with our fists
Whoa whoa

Screaming in the air
The only place I need

Is drinking here with you
WE ARE ALL WE HAVE TONIGHT!
This music is all we got
So let me hear you sing
WE ARE ALL WE HAVE TONIGHT!
HEY! Loud fast music
HEY! Sweat and dirt
WE ARE ALL WE HAVE TONIGHT!
HEY! Sounds from man soul
HEY! The only songs we need
WE ARE ALL WE HAVE TONIGHT!
Whoa whoa ohh we are all we have tonight
Whoa whoa ohh we are all we have tonight
Whoa whoa ohh we are all we have tonight
Whoa whoa ohh we are all we have tonight
