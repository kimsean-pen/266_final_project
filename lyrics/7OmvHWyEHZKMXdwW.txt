I live on oxygen, a bastard monkey boy
Do what the hell I like, I'm no celestial toy
Your goddess is bathed in gold while keeping us in line
We're killing each other for a woman in the sky

Oh, I'm not made, I'm not made by design
Oh, can you be, can you be satisfied?
Oh, I'm not made, I'm not made by design
Oh, can you be, can you be satisfied?

Oh
This kiss in the parking lot is turning me to stone
You take the sweetest thing and claim it as your own

Oh, I'm not made, I'm not made by design
Oh, can you be, can you be satisfied?
Oh, I'm not made, I'm not made by design
Oh, can you be, can you be satisfied?

You take the sweetest thing and claim it as your own

Oh, I'm not made, I'm not made by design
Oh, can you be, can you be satisfied?
Oh, I'm not made, I'm not made by design
Oh, can you be, can you be satisfied?
