Holding onto my breath
As we ascend on to the twin cities
I called to talk without wanting to ruin the fun
Never the same
I can't go back to the place where I once was
Old home, where I was born
Waking up before everyone
Shuffling around until they all woke up
Making a move but it's not my own
I need to stay but it won't be long
