I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back
I want you back

My neighbours think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I have
You're all I have

At night when the stars light on my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the Moon
Tryn' to get to You
In hopes you're on the other side
Talking to me too
Oh Am I a fool who sits alone
Talking to the moon?

I'm feeling like I'm famous
The talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad

But they don't know what I know
Cause when the sun goes down
someone's talking back
Yeah, They're talking back

At night when the stars light on my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the Moon
Tryn' to get to You
In hopes you're on the other side
Talking to me too
Oh Am I a fool who sits alone
Talking to the moon?

Do you ever hear me calling?

'Cause every night
I'm Talking to the Moon
Still tryn' to get to You
In hopes you're on the other side
Talking to me too
Oh Am I a fool who sits alone
Talking to the moon?
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
