Six trees sit beneath six arches
In a glass wrought armory, obsidian
Scavenging for firelight, hobbling
In the ruins of a pillory, crumbling

Heart moved like dead leaves
Run raw with intolerance
Sand bubbling to glass
Time spent in aberrance

Cavern is empty
Doorway is shut
Land is in love
Mingled with grief

A billowing cataract on a long polished gem
Joints scream, stone boils from within
A Silmaril clutched underneath permafrost
Machines whirr, lonely dig belies the cost
A sigh of vapor rises amongst floral haze
Haunted arches resting soft betwixt their gaze

Cavern is empty, cold without meaning
Doorway is shut, forever sealed
Land is in love, heart moved like dead leaves
Mingled with grief, union of aching

Weeping ghost
Living warmth
Glowing blind
Pit of despair
