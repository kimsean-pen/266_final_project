Think I'm steel
Tough as nails
Never feel
Never fail
But you're wrong
So damn wrong

Feel the weight
Of your hate
I still bleed
My heart aches
As you take
And You take

Words cut through my skin
Tears roll down my chin
My walls crumble within
But I'll take it all on
And get up when I fall
Till the last curtain call

But you'll never get the best of me, no more
Said you'll never get the best of me, no more
Aren't you tired of throwing stones
Trying to kick me when I'm down
But you'll never get the best of me, no you won't
So you're cold
Made of ice

Heart of stone
Born to fight
But I cry
I still cry
Are you happy
You know

I'm unhappy
You know
Take your shot
I'm wide open
Words cut through my skin

Tears roll down my chin
My walls crumble within
But I'll take it all on
And get up when I fall
Till the last curtain call
But you'll never get the best of me, no you won't

Said you'll never get the best of me, no more
Aren't you tired of throwing stones
Trying to kick me when I'm down
But you'll never get the best of me, no you won't
But you'll never get the best of me, no you won't
Said you'll never get the best of me, no more
Aren't you tired of throwing stones

Trying to kick me when I'm down
But you'll never get the best of me, no you won't
Heartbroken an beaten
Knocked down and mistreated
I will rise undefeated
I will not let you bring me down
Now the pain is deleted

And I will never repeat it
I will rise and defeat it
I will not let you bring me down
No, I won't let you bring me down
Knocked down and mistreated
Heartbroken and bleeding

Still I rise undefeated

Cause you'll never...
Cause you'll never get the best of me, no you won't
Said you'll never get the best of me, no more
Aren't you tired of throwing stones
Trying to kick me when I'm down
But you'll never get the best of me, no you won't
Heartbroken and bleeding
Knocked down and mistreated
I will rise undefeated
I will not let you bring me down
Now the pain is deleted
And I will never repeat it
I will rise and defeat it
I will not let you bring me down
