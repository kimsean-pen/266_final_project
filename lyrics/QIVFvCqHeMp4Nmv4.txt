Stone-stone when I'm in my zoney zone
Smokin' on that homegrown
Feeling like I'm all alone
Used to go to Kingdom, Rucker Park with Tony Tone
(Harlem!)
Listenin' to Bone Bone, feelin's in my bone bone
I can tell if- I could give a fuck about a list, ya heard?
(Ya heard?)
I could give a fuck about a diss, ya heard?
(Ya heard?)
I could give a fuck about your clique, ya heard?
(Ya heard?)
Shut the fuck up 'fore I rock the bitch, ya heard?
(Ya heard?)
Shut the fuck up

Uh
My mama named me
My papa gave me cock to take a piss with
To fuck ya bitch with
Life is different for me, that's instance
For the type of niggas sprays jizz in some chicks
He wouldn't raise his kids with
That type of twisted shit
Come on, man

Times out
Lets not over with this conversation,
You sound super crazy right now
And I got my two kids listening

People think I'm an asshole
I'll say anything (come on)
Truthfully, I just say what I really think
Like I'm too fresh, man (too fresh), to be your underclass man
I would say "suck my dick"
But that's sexual harassment
Take that (let's go)
Fuck around and really come through in the Merc' on ya (come on)
Who else you know design ya stage and do your merch over (come on)
And if you're lame, do your verse over (yeah)
I changed the game like I'm Kurt Warner (yeah)
I run the game (keep goin') like I'm Time Warner (yeah)
This ain't no Teen Choice Awards (keep goin') I'm slide on ya (yeah)
And make your home for mama start roasting
And lean and beans, tomatoes, potatoes
And cheese and grams it's me and Yams
(Yeah, come on)

See me rest in peace
Pickin' of the last collard green
Stress up outta me, now we sellin' out the colosseum
Urban dynasty
Tell 'em boys who got it locked and got the key
You gotta see behind the scenes of industry (A$AP)

Speak my repertoire, uptown, esplanade

Stone-stone when I'm in my zoney zone
