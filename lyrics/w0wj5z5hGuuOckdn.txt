Here we stand
Somewhere in between this moment and the end
Will we bend?
Or will we open up and take this whole thing in?

Everybody else is smiling
And their smiles don't fade
And you don't even wonder
Why you just don't think that way

Maybe you and me got lost somewhere
We can't move or we can't stay here
Well, maybe we've just had enough
Well, maybe we ain't meant for this love

You and me tried everything
But still that mockingbird won't sing
Well man, this life seems hard enough
Well, maybe we ain't meant for this love

Take my hand
And I will lead you through the broken promise land
Yes I can, oh yes I can
I can be there when you need it
I'll give it all 'til you can't feel it anymore

I don't wanna love you now
If you'll just leave someday
I don't wanna turn around
If you'll just walk away

Maybe you and me got lost somewhere
We can't move or we can't stay here
Well, maybe we've just had enough
Well, maybe we ain't meant for this love

You and me tried everything
But still that mockingbird won't sing
Well man, this life seems hard enough
Well, maybe we ain't meant for this love

Maybe you and me got lost somewhere
We can't move or we can't stay here
Well, maybe we've just had enough
Well, maybe we ain't meant for this love

You and me tried everything
But still that mockingbird won't sing
Well man, this life seems hard enough
Well, maybe we ain't meant for this love

Maybe we ain't meant for this love
Maybe we ain't meant for this love
