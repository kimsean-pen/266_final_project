Maybe nothing else will ever be so clear
Or maybe that's only my fear
If just for one day I wish I could disappear
Just take me far from here
Maybe I'd find out nothing new
Maybe I'd end up just like you

There's no solution
(No solution)
Give me truth to my conviction
Is my own confusion
(My confusion)
Reality or fiction?
Am I out of my mind?

The constant pressure that keeps hanging over me
It makes me feel so empty
It's more than anything that I could ever be
What else could you take from me?
Its getting harder to relate
Don't want to make the same mistake

There's no solution
(No solution)
Give me truth to my conviction
Is my own confusion
(My confusion)
Reality or fiction?
Am I out of my mind?

It took me so long to find out
It's right there in front of me
Too close to see
What I thought was true
I see right through what's killing you

There's no solution
(I can't see)
Give me truth to my conviction
Is my own confusion
(That I feel)
Reality or fiction?
Am I out of my mind?

So maybe nothing else will ever be so clear
Or maybe that's only my fear (Am I out of my mind?)
If just for one day I wish I could disappear
Just take me far from here (Am I out of my mind?)
