Here's a story, there's only me
No other place for you to be
It's only you, babe, it's only you
I can't believe the things you do

Right now, right here
Ain't gonna let you disappear
Right now, this time
You got yours and I got mine, come on

Come on, lover, go back to start
I got your picture in my heart
It's only me, babe, it's only me
Refuse, disposal, refugee

Right now, right here
You just might be my new career
Right now, this time
You got yours and I got mine

Come on, babe, stay close to me
You got me falling out my tree
Be my lover, the only one
Be anything but don't be gone

Right now, right here
Ain't gonna let you disappear
Right now, this time
You got yours and I got mine
