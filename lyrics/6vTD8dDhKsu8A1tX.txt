Step off the train
Walking down your street again
Passed your door
But you don't live there anymore

It's years since you've been there
And now you've disappeared somewhere
To outta space
You've found some better place

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

Could you be dead?
You always were two steps ahead
And everyone
Would walk behind where you would run

I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout
Down to me
Where I always used to be

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

Back on the train
I ask why did i come again?
Can I confess?
I've been hanging around your old address

Years have proved
To offer nothing since you've moved
Now you're gone
I can't move on

And I miss you
And I miss you

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
Passed your door
But you don't live there anymore
