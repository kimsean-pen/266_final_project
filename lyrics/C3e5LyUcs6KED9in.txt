Night falls and I'm alone
Skin, yeah, chilled me to the bone
You turned and you ran, oh yeah
Oh slipped right from my hands

Yeah, blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream never change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
It's like blue on black

Blind, oh but now I see
Truth, lies and in between
Wrong can't be undone, oh no
Well it slipped from the tip of your tongue

Yeah, blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream never change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
It's like blue on black

Blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much

Blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream never change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
It's blue on black

Yeah, blue on black
Yeah, it's blue on black
Yeah, blue on black
