Here come the lonely night
I can't escape my mind

From a broken bough
Fall into finite space
With the roof torn down
This house is an empty place
So tired of wandering around and starting over
No garden grows here now just the one leaf clover
And when the windows shuttered
It's always dark inside
Sometimes the pain is absurd
Still it's what fate decides
Thought I saw Jesus come down
Dressed like a soldier
I used to cry like a clown
And now I'm older

Here come the lonely night
Can't escape my mind

And the grinding wheel turns
And the heavens burn
As the pilot ignites is a lesson learned
A sullen look of concern
It might make you sad
Like the fluttering bird in a dream you had

Here come the lonely night
I can't escape my mind

I saw Jesus come down
Dressed like a soldier
Once I cried like a clown
Now I'm older
Here come the lonely night
Can't escape my mind
