Everybody puts their hands to work
Everybody wanna live it up
No heed for the world to come
Everybody puts their hands to work
So baby loosen up cause it's the weekend

No, I don't complain
'Nuff funds I can make it rain
No rain left for rainy days
No rain, every day be sunny

No, I don't complain
'Nuff funds I can make it rain
No rain left for rainy days
No rain, every day be sunny
I am in need
No rain, every day be sunny

Yeah, Yeah

Don't you worry if the work dries up
Yo babe, I got enough treats on the weekend
The weekend

No, I don't complain
'Nuff funds I can make it rain
Bankrolled then I roll the bank
Bankrolled so I roll it all now

No, I don't complain
Enough funds I can make it rain
No rain left for rainy days
No rain, every day be sunny
I am in need
No rain, every day be sunny

Like this business – don't li-i
Like this business...
Sip that tonic...
Don't – don't like this business, don't li-i
I don't like...
Eat them berries
Like this business – don't li-i
Check your wallet, now check your wallet
Like this business – don't – don't
Like this business – don't li-i
I don't like...
You better check your wallet

No, I don't complain
No rain left for rainy days
Every day be sunny
No rain left for rainy days
No! No! No!
No rain, every day be sunny
I am in need
No rain, every day be sunny
I am in need
No rain, every day be sunny

Sip that tonic, sip that tonic
Sip that tonic, sip that—
Eat them berries, eat them—
Check your wallet
Check your wallet, check your wallet, check your wallet
