All the keys in my mind, oh my, what a sight
Because I want to go home

All the keys in my mind, oh my, what a sight

Because I want to go home

Be a Body
Ha ha ha ha oh oh oh oh
I close my eyes until I see
I don't need hands to touch me
Be a Body
I lean on walls until I stand
I touch my face with my hand
Be a Body
Ha ha ha ha oh oh oh oh
I close my eyes until I see
I don't need hands to touch me
Be a Body
I lean on walls until I stand
I touch my face with my hand
Be a Body
Feel the rhythm oh my god
So than what am I?
So then what am I?
Be a Body
All the keys in my mind, oh my, what a sight
Because I want to go home.
