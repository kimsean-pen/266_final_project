You're strong but the weight of the world is
too much for you to hold
okay so you run it in circles
trying to feel it all
don't tell me you've been waiting outside
for everyone to say that you look alive cause
you look alive love
you look alive love
you look alive love
even in the time that it takes you to put it all to rest
you'll still be out to dry when you could be hurting less
in the time that it takes you running back home
I'll make it to your door, no i won't let you alone
no i won't let you alone
no i won't let you alone
no i won't let you alone
even in the time that it takes you to put it all to rest
you'll still be out to dry when you could be hurting less
in the time that it takes you running back home
I'll make it to your door, no i won't let you alone
i would be lying if i say i wouldn't
do anything for you
i would be lying if i say i wouldn't
do anything for you
i would be lying if i say i wouldn't
do anything for you
i would be lying if i say i wouldn't
do anything for you
i would be lying if i say i wouldn't
do anything for you
i would be lying if i say i wouldn't
do anything for you
i'd do anything love
i'd do anything love
i'd do anything love
i'd do anything love
