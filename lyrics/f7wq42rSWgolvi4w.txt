Life's suddenly faraway, no mistaking
It could be you
I think it every day, if we're the same
The thought could be true
We could be on the floor
On a box screaming more

I know you want me
But I've come close enough for now
Oh God, you haunt me
I'm scared you'll leave me in the ground

Bless me with just one kiss before you leave me
Here with my heart
Tell me you want me home on the phone
Tear me apart
Could we be something more?
All that I'm hoping for?

I know you want me
But I've come close enough for now
Oh God, you haunt me
I'm scared you'll leave me in the ground

I'm scared you'll leave me in the ground
I'm scared you'll leave me in the ground
I'm scared you'll leave me in the ground
I'm scared you'll leave me in the ground
I'm scared you'll leave me in the ground
