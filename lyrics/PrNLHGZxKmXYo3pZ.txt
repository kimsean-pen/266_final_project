I wanna play you all the time
I know I said that I never lied
Because I wanna be somebody new

My feet are bruised from trippin' up
(I just wanna know it's over)
Sometimes I see myself and I can't stand my shoe
(I just wanna know it's over)

Because I wanna be somebody new
Because I wanna be somebody new for you
Because I'm sick of all the dreams that I had
Because I only wanna dream with you by my side

I couldn't dace the truth with you
(I just wanna know it's over)
I know you said no matter what it's true
(I just wanna know it's over)
Imagine walking on the sun in Arizona
Don't wanna be someone you know we might be sooner
I just wanna know it's over, that it's over
(I just wanna know it's over)

Because I wanna be somebody new
Because I wanna be somebody new for you
Because I'm sick of all the dreams that I had
Because I only wanna dream with you by my side

Because I wanna be somebody new
Because I wanna be somebody new for you
