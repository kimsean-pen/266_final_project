Powder in your hair
Staples in your jeans
Fireworks in the water
You were holding
A styro-foam cup
Held between your teeth
Telling me how you're going to outlive your body

What you said I wrote it down,
I wont say, I won't speak - the same
Maybe I know better than
To read more from what's written

After everything, after everything.
Left in the sun, shivering.
After everything.

Gathering your stone
Talk to fill the space
Do you know where some soul was, when they were
The women that we see, to talk me out of everything

Careful what you say next,
don't waste a scene, you're drunk
What you said I wrote it down,
wont say, wont speak - the same

After everything, after everything.
Left in the sun, shivering.
After everything.

What you said I wrote it down,
but wont say, wont speak - the same
Maybe I know better than
to read more than what's there

After everything, after everything.
Left in the sun, shivering.
After everything.
