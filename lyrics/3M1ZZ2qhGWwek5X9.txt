Meet me down by the jetty landing
Where the the pontoons bump and sway
I see the others reading, standing
As the Manly Ferry cuts its way to Circular Quay
Hear the Captain blow his whistle
So long she's been away
I miss our early morning wrestle
Not a very Happy way to start the day
She don't like That kind of behaviour
She don't like That kind of behaviour

So, throw down your guns
Don't be so reckless
Throw down your guns
Don't be so

Feel like Scott of the Antarctic
Base camp too far away
A Russian sun beneath the Arctic
Burke and Wills and camels
Initials in the tree
She don't like That kind of behaviour
She don't like That kind of behaviour

So, throw down your guns
Don't be so reckless
Throw down your guns
Don't be so
