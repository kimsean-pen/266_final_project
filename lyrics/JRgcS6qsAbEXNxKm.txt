Late at night you feel me creep in
One touch takes you out your sleep
And i got you where i want
Stop before I'm done
You're begging me
I won't do it again

Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
I'm holding out

Now you're wide awake, I'm on top
Suddenly I'm the one who can't stop
No rules to this game
Turn me out
Now I'm helpless
And i beg you
Do it again

Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
But you're holding out

I keep beggin' you beggin' you beggin' you
I keep beggin' you beggin' you beggin' you
But you're holding out
