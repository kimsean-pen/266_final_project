Talk won't work this out
I don't need to share
I just need to scream
So stop telling me I'm not the man that I should be

You blame me, shame me
You take it all, out on me
So stop telling me I'm not the man you should believe

If dying is your way out
Then count me in I'm coming
Maybe a different spin
And I'm so used to being a coward
It's all I've ever been
I quit before I win

Stand tall and fight this out
You can't call for help
You can't make a scene
Stop acting out
Like you're the one that's meant to be

Take me, hate me
But you can't make me come clean
So stop telling me I'm not the man you should believe

If dying is your way out
Then count me in I'm coming
Maybe a different spin
And I'm so used to being a coward
It's all I've ever been
I quit before I win

I'd like to keep cutting
I'd like to keep cutting
But I can't stand to watch myself bleed

I'd like to keep cutting
I'd like to keep cutting
But I can't stand to watch myself bleed

I'd like to keep cutting
I'd like to keep cutting
But I can't stand to watch myself bleed

I'd like to keep cutting
I'd like to keep cutting
But I can't stand to watch myself bleed

If dying is your way out
Then count me in I'm coming
Maybe a different spin
And I'm so used to being a coward
It's all I've ever been
I quit before I win

I quit before I win
I quit before I win
