If I could I'd trade my heart for a second brain
I wish I was as brave as my last name suggests
I wanna pour my feelings down the drain
But I'll just take another sip until my eyes drip
"Stay the same."

I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna think about it
Because the last time that
I had these thoughts
I just kept going on about it
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna think about it
And the worst part of it is

That I don't hear from my friends anymore
Yeah, everything slows down my 24
The size of my bad thoughts broke down my door
And everything slows down
Yeah, everything slows down

Daylight savings gives me time to think
Which is the last thing that I want since I don't drink
So I can't numb my feelings to avoid my thoughts
That climb to the back of my head tying my veins in knots

I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna think about it
Because the last time that
I had these thoughts
I just kept going on about it
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna think about it
And the worst part of it is

That I don't hear from my friends anymore
Yeah, everything slows down my 24
The size of my bad thoughts broke down my door
And everything slows down
Yeah, everything slows down
And I don't hear from my friends anymore
Yeah, everything slows down by 24
The size of my bad thoughts broke down my door
And everything slows down
Yeah, everything slows down

I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna think about it
Because the last time that
I had these thoughts
I just kept going on about it
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna think about it
And the worst part of it is

That I don't hear from my friends anymore
Yeah, everything slows down my 24
The size of my bad thoughts broke down my door
And everything slows down
Yeah, everything slows down
And I don't hear from my friends anymore
Yeah, everything slows down by 24
The size of my bad thoughts broke down my door
And everything slows down
Yeah, everything slows down

That I don't hear from my friends anymore
And everything slows down down down down
Yeah, everything slows down
