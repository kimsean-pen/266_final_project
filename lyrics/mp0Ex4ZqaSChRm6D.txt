I'll stay with you until the end
I say you'll let me be your friend
I'll say you'll let me in the end
I just want to be your friend.

How can I be sure you're breaking all the rules
How can I be sure I should be high above
I climbed a mountain reaching for the skies
And all too soon I jump the moon and find I'm losing my mind.

Don't tell me I'm the howling wind
Don't tell me you're the wounded star
And don't tell me I'm the devil's friend
Don't tell me
Don't tell me
I've gone too far.

I didn't hear you as you left my room last night
Don't turn your back on me
I didn't hear you as you left the room last night
Please return and set me free.

I climbed a mountain reaching for the skies
And all too soon I jumped the moon and find the sun burns my eyes.

Don't tell me I'm the howling wind
Don't tell me you're the wounded star
And don't tell me I'm the devil's friend
Don't tell me
Don't tell me
I've gone too far.

I can't get a grip on
I can't get a grip on
I can't get a grip on you
I can't get a grip on
No
No
Can't get a grip on.

I say you'll let me in the end
I say you'll let me be your friend.
I maybe asked this once before
Don't you love me any more?
