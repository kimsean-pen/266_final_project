You can be my slave
And I'll be a stranger

We could be in passion
We could be in danger

Take you off the streets
Put you under my wings

Yeah, you could pull my leg
Or anything

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah

You could be the devil
You could be the saviour

Well I really can't tell
By the way that your behaviour

I'll take you off the boat
Put you under my wing
Yeah, you could pull my leg
Or anything

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah

I don't know what you're playin'
Don't even know what you're sayin'

You gotta leave me alone
I'm gonna go on home

Aaoh, the things are gettin' tougher
Yeah, the things are gettin' rougher
This is Alice speakin'

(Suffer!)

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You could be the devil
You could be the saviour

Well I really can't tell
By the way that your behaviour

Take you off the streets
Put you under my wings

Yeah, you could pull my leg
Or anything

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
