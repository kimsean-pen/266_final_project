Do you wanna be an angel
Do you wanna be a star
Do you wanna play some magic on my guitar
Do you wanna be a poet
Do you wanna be my string
You could be anything

Do you wanna be the lover of another
Undercover you could even be the man on the moon

Do you wanna be the player
Do you wanna be the string
Let me tell you something
It just don't mean a thing

You see it really doesn't matter
When you're buried in disguise
By the dark glass on your eyes
Though your flesh has crystallized

Still... you turn me on
Still... you turn me on
Mmmm... you turn me on

Do you wanna be the pillow where I lay my head
Do you wanna be the feathers lying in my bed
Do you wanna be the cover of a magazine
Create a scene

Every day a little sadder
A little madder
Someone get me a ladder

Do you wanna be the singer
Do you wanna be the song
Let me tell you something
You just couldn't be more wrong

You see I really have to tell you
That it all gets so intense
From my experience
It just doesn't seem to make sense

Still... you turn me on
Mmmm... you turn me on, yeah
Mmmm... you turn me on.
