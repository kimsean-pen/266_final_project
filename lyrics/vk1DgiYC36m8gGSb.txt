making love underneath the bed
shooting stars from a purple sky
I dont care
how I do it
im the man on the flaming pie
stick my tongue out and lick my nose
took my shirt in and zip my fly
go ahead
have a vision
im the man on the flaming pie
now, everything I do has a simple explanation
when im with you
you could do with a vacation
I took my brains and stretched them on the rack
now im not so sure im ever going to get them back
cut my toes off to spite my feet
I dont know whether laugh or cry
never mind
check my rythm
im the man on a flaming pie
im the man on a flaming pie
now, everything I do has a simple explanation
when im with you
you could do with a vacation
I took my brains and stretched them on the rack
now im not so sure im ever going to get them back
