Baby Grace is the victim
She was fourteen years of age
And the wheels are turning, turning
For the finger points at me

All's well
(Eee eee)
(But I have not been to Oxford town)
All's well
(But I have not been to Oxford town)
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies

And the prison priests are decent
My attorney seems sincere
I fear my days are numbered
Lord, get me out of here

All's well
(Feel's feel)
(But I have not been to Oxford town)
All's well
(But I have not been to Oxford town)
Toll the bell
(Baby, baby)
Pay the private eye
(Baby, baby)
All's well
(Baby, baby)
Twentieth century dies
(Baby, baby)

This is your shadow on my wall
This is my flesh and blood
This is what I could've been

And the wheels are turning and turning
As this Twentieth century dies
If I had not ripped the fabric
If time had not stood still
If I had not met Ramona
If I had only make paid my bill

All's well
(But I have not been to Oxford town)
All's well
(But I have not been to Oxford town)
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies

This is my bunk with two sheets
This is my food though foul
This is what I could have been

Toll the bell
(Baby)
Pay the private eye
(Baby)

All's well
(Baby)
Twentieth century dies
(Baby)
Toll the bell
(Baby)
Pay the private eye
(Baby)

All's well
(Baby)
Twentieth century dies
(Baby)
All's well
(Baby)
Twentieth century dies
(Baby)
All's well
(Baby)
All's well
(Baby)
All's well
(Baby)
Toll the bell
(Baby)
Pay the private eye
(Baby)

All's well
(Baby)
Twentieth century dies
(Baby)
Toll the bell
(Baby)
Pay the private eye
(Baby)

All's well
(Baby)
Twentieth century dies
(Baby)

Baby
Baby
