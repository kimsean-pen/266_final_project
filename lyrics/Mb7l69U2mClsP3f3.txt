A coffee stain on a window sill
A bad translation to a foreign film
Just wandering round with you
Just wandering town with you
Oh oh oh oh
Would be enough

The tiny cracks on the city stone
Or welcome back to your troubled home
Just wandering round with you
Just wandering town with you
oh oh oh oh
Would be enough

But ohhhhhhhhhhhh
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
Ohhhhhhhhh
And I didn't feel your love until I lost

The moving shadows on your swaying light
Or you picture notes of porcupines
Just wandering round with you
Just wandering town with you
Oh oh oh oh would be enough

But ohhhhhhhhhhhh
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
Ohhhhhhhhh
And I didn't feel your love until I lost
