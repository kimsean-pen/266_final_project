You have to discover me,
What goes wrong when I'm crying,
What I want when I'm smiling.
Can you feel it?

That I'm not a little girl,
You re misunderstanding my way,
And all the rolles that I like to play.

Use your imagination, I'm not easy but I'm true,
My secret combination
Boy you have to try it hard,
To win a destination in the center of my heart.
