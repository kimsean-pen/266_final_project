Lord Of Terror

[Written by Draugluin 1995]

I will tear this world apart
All praise to the Destroyer
All praise to me!

I can feel the Evil Spirits calling
They whisper my name in the Dark
I can see beyond the Daemon Gates
And enter the realms beyond
I kneel before the ancient altar
A servant of Madness, The angel of the Dark
I am the Manifestation of Chaos
By my word this world will burn!

Lord of Terror - Slay the lambs of god
Lord of Terror - Drown them in their blood
Lord of Terror - The Black Divinity
Lord of Terror - Rule for eternity

The Portal to the realm beyond
Splits the Night wide open
The sky turns black shadowed
By a thousand Unholy Daemons

The Holocaust has begun!

Blood is bleeding from my eyes
As Thunder roar from Darkened skies
I laugh as Blood stains my pale skin
This Battle I was predicted to win

Lord of Terror - Slay the lambs of god
Lord of Terror - Drown them in their blood
Lord of Terror - The Black Divinity
Lord of Terror - Rule for eternity

The Portal to the realm beyond
Splits the Night wide open
The sky turns black shadowed
By a thousand Unholy Daemons

The Holocaust has begun!
This world is burning!
