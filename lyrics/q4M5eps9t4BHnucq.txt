(Now is the only thing that's real)

Binge
Cringe
On the fringe (The police used to watch over the people. Now they're watching the people)
Sloppy
Binge
Cringe (Now is the only thing that's real.)
Sloppy
Mincing
Eye-dropping
Biopsy
Cyclops overlooks
Optic options
Rotten showstopper
Skinpopper
Babbler dabbler
Self confessed criminal tore pen in vain
Instant still spellbound
Game stock talk back rock
Reencounter incident
Subsistence inexistent (Now is the only thing that's real.)
Non committed
Unwitted
Oblivious
Habitual
Resistor
Roughed up edge fluent nudge pre-collect ignition
Motivation
Inexistent
Wasted views that's all they see blue
Hot blood guilt optic nerve
With the right attitude
You will succeed blue
Self abusive
Recluse
Too late for me
Make
Shifting peace
Unsettling
Crazy
Doing crazy things
Keep your eyes open
Soft spoken Changes nothing
A view
So cruel
Dogs body comatose
Torchlight roast
Disinterest
Disinfect
Retold
Impressed by possession
Insiders know
Refresh
Detained contest
Offer is pure
Sure tonight
Freeze in time or shadows climb distracting override
Instincts Evolve
Over and over
Wasted

(Do you, don't you
Want me to make you?
It's comin' down fast
But don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover
But you ain't no dancer)

Wasted truth
Why call at all blue
Hot lines
Eventual decline
With the right attitude
You will succeed blue
Resent That discontent
Sidestep
Define
The state of things
So far
Crazy Things
Soft spoken
With your eyes (Open)
You know soft spoken changes nothing?
