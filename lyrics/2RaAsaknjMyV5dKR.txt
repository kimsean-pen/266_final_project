I am burning in this fire
like a filthy generation
with artificial desires
in a magical devotion
I'm just looking for a frontline
I'm just looking for a gunshot fire
I'm the leader of this army
I'm the goddess of the bedlem's high

all I wanna do is for tonite
burning fires
let be Jesus being my spy
human liars
I just wanna let you cry
burning fires
in a dark and vicious sky
human liars

I am sick of all this waiting
I won't tell you my imperfections
they are burning in that fire
for a cinical perfection
I'm just looking for a frontline
I'm just looking for a gunshot fire
I'm the leader of this army
I'm the goddess of the bedlem's high
