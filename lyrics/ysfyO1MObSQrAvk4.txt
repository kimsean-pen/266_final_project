Should of died about a thousand times or maybe more
Don't remember any lives that ever came before
In my head I'm more dead than alive
It's a shame you won't understand

Gonna let the rain come down on me and wash away
Gonna give away my innocence, my sympathy
In this moment I'm lost and I did it myself
There's no one to blame

You can't save my life
These events are already in motion
So don't waste my time
You keep talking me back off the ledge
Your words unheard
Dragging me down once again
When I'm living a lie
When I'm shut down inside
When I'm chasing a high
When I'm chasing a high

I am still alive but I am just an empty shell
I give myself away to this lonely hollow hell
In my head I'm afraid that I can't trust myself
You won't understand

You can't save my life
These events are already in motion
So don't waste my time
You keep talking me back off the ledge
Your words unheard
Dragging me down once again
When I'm living a lie
When I'm shut down inside
When I'm chasing a high

All hope is lost
All hope is lost
All hope is lost

You can't save my life
These events are already in motion
So don't waste my time (don't waste my time)
You keep talking me back off the ledge
Your words unheard
Dragging me down once again
When I'm living a lie
When I'm shut down inside
When I'm chasing a high
When I'm chasing a high
When I'm chasing a high

There is no fix
There is no fix
There is no fix
