Mama, Mama
You're a whiz and a scholar too
Mama open up the room lock
Sip, sip
I'm going to the moon dock

He gives to me
Buckles off shingles
Off a cockleshell on Norway basin

Coke and tuna
Boots and roses from Russia
Now I'll live and die and rise
With my captain
Mama I told my
Mama say go

Meet me Capt. St. Lucifer
Darlin' I'll be there
Don't you know

Meet me Capt. St. Lucifer
Darlin' I'll be there
And if you know
Don't you know
Now don't you know I love you

Meet me Capt. St. Lucifer
I love you
Love you I do

Mama Mama
You're a whiz and a scholar too
Mama I'm at anchor in your glow now
Sip sip
Even as I go now

He gives to me
Buckles off shingles
And a jangle from a Congo love chase
Early bloomers made of earth and love lace

Now I'll live and die and rise
With my captain
Mama I told my
Mama be happy

Meet me Capt. St. Lucifer
Darlin' I'll be there
Don't you know

Meet me Capt. St. Lucifer
Darlin' I'll be there
And if you know

Gutters in stacks
Is where I come from
Buckles off a poverty drum

Oh, my love trumpet soul
Tell Gabriel
To tell the captain
Thank you baby
You're my baby now
