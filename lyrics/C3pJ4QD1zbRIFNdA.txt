Martina:
The place where... X6

Tricky:
...Where I stand

Martina:
The place where I stand gives way to liquid lino
Underneath the weeping willow lies a weeping wino
The place where I stand gives way to liquid lino
Underneath the weeping willow lies a weeping wino

Tricky:
Uhh...

Martina:
The mighty crowd-

Martina and Tricky:
Search for their spaces

Martina:
And turn around time's gone-

Martina and Tricky:
Take ten paces.

Martina:
Been up ahead -

Martina and Tricky:
Can't make head or tail of it

Martina:
I drink till I'm drunk-

Martina and Tricky:
And I smoke till I'm senseless.

Martina:
You see in black and white

Martina and Tricky:
Feel in slow motion

Martina:
I drown myself in sorrow

Martina and Tricky:
Until I wake up tomorrow.
The illusion of confusion

Martina:
It's not from where I am sat

Tricky:
Recircle recycle resemble me

Martina:
Different levels of the devil's company

Tricky:
Yeah x3

Martina:
They lead us outside-

Martina and Tricky:
Take us out quietly

Martina:
To the cage through the bars-

Martina:
The place where I stand gives way to liquid lino
(gives way to)
Underneath the weeping willow lies a weeping whino
(underneath the... there lies a weeping)
The place where I stand gives way to liquid lino
(the place where... gives... liquid)
Underneath the weeping willow lies a weeping whino

The mighty crowd search for their spaces
(the illusion of confusion... search for...)
And turn around time's gone, I take ten paces.
(turn around... gone, i take ten paces)
Been up ahead - can't make head or tail of it
(can't make head or tail of it)
I drink 'till I'm drunk, and I smoke till I'm senseless.
(I smoke, I smoke, I smoke)

You see in black and white, feel in slow motion,
(feel in slow slow motion, and drown drown myself in sorrow)
I drown myself in sorrow, until I wake up tomorrow
(till i wake up tomorrow, the illusion of, the illusion of)
I drown myself in sorrow, until I wake up tomorrow
(the illusion of, the illusion of)
I drown myself in, I drown myself in
(the illusion of... until I, until I wake up tomorrow)
The illusion of confusion is not from where I am sat
(it's not from where I'm... circle)
