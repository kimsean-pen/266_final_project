Her world came crashing down
And all that it contained
A million pieces of dreams
Coming apart at the seams

But she twists and she whirls
Dismissing it all away
Wasn't quite the same
As it was yesterday

Her night begins the day
Why think, when we can play
I find it so hard to find
A certain dress of that kind

As she twists and she whirls
And she dances it all away
The problems persist
They won't go away

She twists and she whirls
Dancing it all away
Would rather see the night
Than the reason of the day

I find it so hard to find
Any reason to this kind

As she twists and she whirls
And she dances it all away
The problems persist
They won't go away

She twists and she whirls
Dancing it all away
Would rather see the night
Than the reason of the day
