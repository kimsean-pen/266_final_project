The sound of your laugh has a ring of weariness
The night has a thousand eyes and your smile of heaviness
I've always asked for nothing but you've found it hard to see
So I gathered all I had and laid it down before you feet
I gathered all I had

So how do you feel today?
How do you feel today?
'Cause tonight I'm closing all the doors
So stay outside or lay down with our flaws
How do you feel today?

We moved faster than fate but it came at a cost
Now you're tripping over backwards for the days of youth you lost
I offered you my hands and I've given you my hope
So let me be your salvation, I refuse to be your rope

So how do you feel today?
How do you feel today?
'Cause tonight I'm closing all the doors
So stay outside or lay down with our flaws
How do you feel today?

I've seen the glory but it wasn't enough
Those songs and bells were just the laughter of guns
I knew your stories, I knew it was love
But those songs and bells were the laughter of guns

So how do you feel today?
How do you feel today?
'Cause tonight I'm closing all the doors
So stay outside or lay down with our flaws
How do you feel today?
