It's two kids flying down the hall in our bedroom
It's a breaking board on the front porch
You swear you're gonna fix it soon
It's the kitchen table where we say our prays
Give a little thanks to the man upstairs
It's the feeling I get when I look at you

It ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
And it ain't a mansion on a hill
It's perfectly imperfect
It's worth more than it's worth
It's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
This is our kingdom

It's been late nights, a few good fights
Wouldn't sleep until we worked things out
It's been long days of leanin' on faith
Even when we had our doubts
Barely gettin' by, stretched to the limits
All the hard times, no, I wouldn't trade a minute
We've come so far, it made us who we are
Right here, right now

It ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
And it ain't a mansion on a hill
It's perfectly imperfect
It's worth more than it's worth
It's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
And this is our kingdom
This is our, this is our, this is our kingdom
Oh, yeah, this is our kingdom

No, it ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
And it ain't a mansion on a hill
It's perfectly imperfect
It's worth more than it's worth
It's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
This is our kingdom
Oh, yeah
This is our, this is our kingdom
This is our kingdom

It's our names craved out on that old, old tree
Pictures on the wall of you and me
It's our heart, it's our home, it's our babies faces
It's the light, it's the love living in these places
Church on Sunday, tyre swings
Good and the bad times
Praying on our knees
Begging the lord for this beautiful life
The love we have built will stand the test of time, yeah

Oh, this is our kingdom
This is our kingdom, yeah
This is our kingdom
It's pictures on the wall of you and me
Thanking the lord, praying on our knees
In our kingdom
