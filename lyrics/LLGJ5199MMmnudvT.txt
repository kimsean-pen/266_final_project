It's not that
I can't Live
Without you
It's just that
I Don't Even
Want to try
Every Night
I Dream

About You
Ever Since
The day
We said goodbye
If I wasn't
Such a Fool

Right now
I'd Be Holding You
There's Nothing
That I wouldn't do
Baby
If I Only Knew

The Words to Say

The Road
to Take
To Find
a Way Back
To your Heart
What Can I do

To Get to you?
And Find
a Way Back

To your Heart

...

I don't Know how
it Got so Crazy

But I'll Do Anything
to Set things Right
'Cause your Love
is so Amazing
Baby
You're the Best Thing

in my Life

Let me Prove
my Love is Real
And made you Feel
The Way I Feel

I Promise
I would Give the World
If Only
You would tell me, girl

The Words to Say
The Road
to Take
To Find a
Way Back
To your Heart
What Can I do
To Get to you?
And Find a
Way Back
To your Heart

Give me
One More Chance
(Give me One More Chance)
To give
My Love to You
(Give you my love, my love)
'Cause No One
On this Earth
Loves you
Like I do

Tell me

The Words to Say
The Road
to Take
To Find a
Way Back
To your heart
What Can I do
To Get to you?
And Find a
Way Back
To your Heart

I Turn Back Time
To Make you Mine
And Find a
Way Back
to your Heart
I Beg and Plead
Fall to my Knees
To Find a
Way Back
to your Heart
The words to say
The Road
to Take
(The Road to Take)
To Find a Way Back
to your Heart
(I Gotta Find a Way)
(I Gotta Find a Way)
What Can I do?
To Get to you?
(This Heart Of Mine)
(Belongs to You)
And Find a
Way Back
to your Heart
...
Back to Your Heart
