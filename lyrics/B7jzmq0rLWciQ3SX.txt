It's only common sense
So please don't take offense
I gotta say what's on my mind

'Cause all this bitterness
Has made me second guess
And I've waited all my life

You know it's true
It isn't me and it isn't you
I can't be your man
But here's what I don't understand

If I can't live without you
And I can't breathe when I'm with you
What am I really doin' here?

I don't wanna live without you
But God only knows what I've been through
'Cause dying is all we're doing here

You leave me suffering
'Til I can't feel a thing
It's all I got when I want more

If I waste one more day
Then they can take me away
'Cause it will be worse than it was before

You know it's true
It isn't me and it isn't you
And I can't be your man
Here's what I don't understand

If I can't live without you
And I can't breathe when I'm with you
What am I really doin' here?

I don't wanna live without you
But God only knows what I've been through
'Cause dying is all we're doing here

If I can't live without you
And I can't breathe when I'm with you
What am I really doin' here?

I don't wanna live without you
But God only knows what I've been through
'Cause dying is all we're doing here

If I can't live without you
And I can't breathe when I'm with you
What am I really doin'?
What am I really doin' here?

I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna live without you
'Cause dying is all we're doing
Here
