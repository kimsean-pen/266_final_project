We are only a drop of water
Dwelling in an ocean of stars

An ocean of stars

One day she might come back to find
the remains of her progeny

The one who rules laws that leave
A substantial part to fantasy
I gave you this name...
For I know you'll be ever here...
To remind me that I'm always free to see
My own light
I gave this name...
For in spite of your deathlike side
You are my greatest source of light
That makes me see the brightness
All around me

(Solo)

Left as founding...
The eternal slave
Which remains the greatest
Forgotten one

Lost in an ocean of stars

One tends to only ask the obvious questions
Aiming to strenghten one's self-admiration
While there seems to be a certain lack of devotion
Concerning the most direct path to self-observation

None will ever know if her faith was fair
She could have been the burning star
To ring the last hour of life on earth

Thus humanity would never have had the opportunity
To realize the work that we have not yet completed

Left as founding...
The eternal slave
Which remains the greatest
Forgotten one

I gave you this name...
For I know you'll be ever here...
To remind me
That I have the chance to shape my being
You are my greatest source of light
Making me see the brightness
All around me
