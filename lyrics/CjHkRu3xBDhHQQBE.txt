I'm on your sight to pray
I'm on your sight to stay and float
but when you turning to seek
I don't know who, who you are.

I'm on your sight to ride,
I'm on your sight to fight
but when you're turning to seek
I don't know who, who you are

People they got not light, it's only pain
but it's under your sun, I walk up here.
People they got not light, it's only pain
but it's under your sun, I walk up here.

I'm on your sight to share,
they good about the red
but when you turning to seek
I don't know who, who you are.

I'm on your sight to live,
but down to sunset ...the shadows
but when you turning to seek
I don't know who, who you are.
