The sweat upon your forehead
Caught em once upon the floor
Peeling off the plastic

Still your single perfume
The guilt I always get from you
Filling up this bedroom

Stop stop stop stop
It's not like you wasn't warned
Like I have said before
Shut
The
Fuck
Up
When the truth is on your tongue

When you show me your soul but I don't wanna know
That's not the protocol
Said leave your heart at home
In the dark of the night come and lay down your bones
Sure you can fall in love, no need to let me know

Rules are there for a reason
If you can't fight what you're feeling
Please shut the door as you're leaving
That's not the protocol
Said leave your heart at home

Where'd you learn your new moves?
Where'd you go when I can't get through?
Can he do the things I do?

Stop stop stop stop
It's not like you wasn't warned
Like I have said before
Shut
The
Fuck
Up
The truth is on your tongue

When you show me your soul but I don't wanna know
That's not the protocol
Said leave your heart at home
In the dark of the night come and lay down your bones
Sure you can fall in love, no need to let me know

Rules are there for a reason
If you can't fight what you're feeling
Please shut the door as you're leaving
That's not the protocol
Said leave your heart at home

Stop stop stop stop
Don't wanna feel this too
Want nothing more with you
Stop stop stop stop
Please put away your soul
It's not the protocol
Stop stop stop stop stop

When you show me your soul but I don't wanna know

Try to show me your soul but I don't wanna know
That's not the protocol
Said leave your heart at home
In the dark of the night come and lay down your bones
Sure you can fall in love, no need to let me know

Rules are there for a reason
If you can't fight what you're feeling
Please shut the door as you're leaving
That's not the protocol
Said leave your heart at home
