We were waiting for the bus
No one much around but us
Then I see this young boy
Caught a look at me

I'm stunned in a daze
He had the whole street set ablaze
It's only love they say
Makes you feel this way

She liked his eyes, she wanted more
The baby gonna have your smile for sure
He saw a lovely girl
Smelling sweet and soapy like fresh air
She saw him looking, acted like she didn't care

That's how we knew
And so love grew a flower
A flower that is you

Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame

Even to the angels it may sound like a lie
For you, child
He has the troops and extra backup standing by

For you, child
For you, he's the best he can be
For you, child
For you, he's the best he can be

Oh, child don't you know?
Your daddy love come
With a lifetime guarantee

Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Yeah, daddy loves you child
Your daddy knows you're a flame, oh
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Daddy love you, yeah

It's only you he'll say
Made the young boy hungry
For the man he is today
It's only love, love, love, love
Can make you feel this way

Your daddy knows you're a flame, oh
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Yeah, daddy loves you child
Oh, your daddy knows you're a flame
Oh, your daddy knows you're a flame

Your daddy love come
With a lifetime guarantee

Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Daddy loves you, yeah
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
Can I tell you that your daddy love you?

Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame

Oh child, don't you know?
Your daddy love come
With a lifetime guarantee

Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame
