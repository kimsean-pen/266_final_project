A'Rebours
You sent for me
I was knock knock knocking on death's door
You ignore, adore, a rebours me
You leave me washed up begging for more
If you really cared for me
Ah you'd let me be
You'd set me free
But what you robbed me of is my...
Oh is my liberty

The curtain was calling
You were there blewn away and a rebours
In the mirror bawling
If you want it so much you are gonna have it all
Ah if you really cared for me
Christ knows you'd let me be
You'd set me free
I'm too polite to say...

I defy you all
You know twice as much as nothing at all
It's still nothing at all

I can defy us all
Tides are now turned and hammered it all
Hammered it all

Ah, no, ah no, ah no...

I've been running round this world too much, girl
Pretending not to see
What's drilling me, it's killing me

Oh no, I think I understand
What I misunderstood before
How your love gives me so much more
I am free again, I can see again.
But if I should fall
Would you vow today to pay tomorrow
The fked off big debt I owe to sorrow...
Ah, oh... sorrow... sorrow...
Ah, oh... sorrow
Ah, no, ah no, ah no...
