Don't need you in my life
It's not that I don't love you baby
(I said I don't love you baby)
Can't think of what you want
I wish that I could show you baby

Easy come and easy go
And talk too much making
Me really wanna come through
(Yeah baby)
I don't want to check, yeah
I just do my best, woo
Baddies to my left, huh
Goofy call the ref because
I'm cooler than you

Are, are you ashamed
What are we supposed to
Do with our hearts
Love is not a game
I'm just here protecting all that I am

Don't need you in my life
It's not that I don't love you baby (huh)
Can't think of what you want
I wish that I could show you baby

Motorola can't control ya
Callin' home just to see if
it's gonna go through (Yeah baby)
I don't want to check, yeah
I just do my best, woo
Baddies to my left, huh
Goofy call the ref because
I'm cooler than you

Are, are you ashamed
What are we supposed to
Do with our hearts
Love is not a game
I'm just here protecting all that I am

I will give you want you want
Let's finish what we started
Got me dancing in the dark
Let's finish what we started

I can't get you off my mind
And I will keep you satisfied
Just look real deep into my eyes
Can't live without you by my side

I can't get you off my mind
I will keep you satisfied
Just look real deep into my eyes
Can't live without you by my side
