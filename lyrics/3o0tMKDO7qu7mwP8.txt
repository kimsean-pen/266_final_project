Pungent smells they consummate my home
Beyond the black horizon
Trying to take control
See my girl she shivers in her bones
The sun and zenith rising
Trying to take us all

There's a fire between us
So where is your God
There's a fire between us
I can't get off the carousel
I can't get off the carousel
I can't get off the carousel
I can't get off this world

The sickening taste
Homophobic jokes
Images of fascist votes
Beam me up 'cause I can't breathe

Spaceman I've always wanted you to go
Into space, man

I can't get up, I can't get up
I can't get up, I can't get up
I can't get up, I can't get up
I can't get up, I can't get up

It's time to terminate the great wide world
Morbid fascinations television takes control
Decimation different races fall
Electronic information tampers with your soul

There's a fire between us
So where is your God?
There's a fire between us
I can't get off the caruosel
I can't get off the carousel
I can't get off the carousel
I can't fall off this world

The sickening taste
Homophobic jokes
Images of fascist votes
Beam me up 'cause I can't breathe

Spaceman I always wanted you to go
Into space man
Spaceman I always wanted you to go
Into space man
