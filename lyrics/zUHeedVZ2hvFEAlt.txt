And the world
Pulled me high
Far above
Wicked skies
Set me free
Set alive
I become
Satellite

Isolated
I succumb to the weight of world
Separated
I fall from the sky

Is this death or rebirth?
Falling back to the earth

I ignite
Engine glow
Jettison
All I know

Isolated
I succumb to the weight of world
Separated
I fall from the sky

Is this death or rebirth?
Falling back to the earth.
