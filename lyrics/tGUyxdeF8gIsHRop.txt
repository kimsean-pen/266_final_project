I play out my role
Why I've even been out walking
They tell me that it helps
But I know when I'm beaten

All those lonely films
And all those lonely parties
But now the feeling is off-screen
An' the tears for real, not acted, anymore

I'm all mixed up inside
I want to run, but I can't hide
And however much we try
We can't escape the truth and the fact is

Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
'Cause I end up hurting you

One more covered sigh
And one more glance, you know means goodbye
Can't you see that's why
We're dashing ourselves against the rocks of a lifetime

Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
'Cause I end up hurting you

(In my mind different voices call)
What once was pleasure now's pain for us all
(In my heart only shadows fall)
I once stood proud, now I feel so small
(I don't know whether to laugh or cry)
The long hot summer just passed me by

Shu du du du, du de de wop
Shu du du du, du de de wop
Shu du du du, du de de wop
Shu du du du, du de de wop
Shu du du du, du de de wop
Shu du du du, du de de wop
Shu du du du, du de de wop
Shu du du du, du de de wop
Shu du du du, du de de wop
Shu du du du, du de de wop
Shu du du du, du de de wop

I want to run, but I can't hide
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
'Cause I end up hurting...

Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
'Cause I end up hurting...

Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
'Cause I end up hurting you
