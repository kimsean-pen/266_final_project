Ice baby
I saw your girlfriend and she was
Eating her fingers like they're just another meal
But she waits there
In the levee washes
Mixing cocktails with a plastic-tipped cigar

My eyes stick to all the shiny robes
You wear on the protein delta strip
In an abandoned house but I will wait there
I'll be waiting forever...
I'm waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting...
Go!

Minerals, ice deposit daily, drop off
The first shiny robe
I've got a lot of things I want to sell, but
Not here, babe-- Tokyo...

Every time I sit around I find I'm shot
Every time I sit around I find I'm shot
Every time I turn around my friend
Every time I sit around my friend
Every time every time every time every time every time every time
You're my... summer babe
Summer babe
Summer babe
Summer babe
