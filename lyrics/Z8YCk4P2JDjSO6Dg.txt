it's not so worth getting all bent out of shape about
i turned my back on it and next you know its all about
do you wanna step outside
or do you wanna get a ride?
i don't know just what i feel
but i feel it all tonight

i give it all in these hours that we set aside
i know i'm feeling brave
but that's because my heart's untied
don't wanna trip anymore
i've found the only truth
we got enough to spare
cause we're awake through all our youth
