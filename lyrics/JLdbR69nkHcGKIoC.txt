Oh, can't you take care of her
Oh, maybe you can spare her
Several moments of your consideration
Leading up to the final destination
Oh, the Earth is calling out
I wanna learn what it's all about
But everything I read is global warming, going green
I don't know what all this means
But it seems to be saying
Wake up America
We're all in this together
It's our home so let's take care of it

You know that you want to, you know that you got to
Wake up America
Tomorrow becomes a new day
And everything you do, matters
Yeah, everything you do
Matters, in some way
Stand up i'll try if you will

Wake up, it's not a fire drill
All she needs is a little attention
Can you give her just a little attention?
Oh, it's easy to look away
But it's getting harder day by day
Everything I read is global warming, going green
I don't know what all this means
But it seems to be saying

Wake up America
We're all in this together
It's our home so let's take care of it
You know that you want to, you know that you got to
Wake up America
Tomorrow becomes a new day
And everything you do, matters
Yeah, everything you do

Matters, in some way
I know that you don't want to hear it
Especially coming from someone so young
But in the back seat

Yeah, they want to hear it
So come on, come on, so come on
Wake up America
We're all in this together

It's our home so let's take care of it
You know that you want to, you know that you got to
Wake up America
Tomorrow becomes a new day
And everything you do, matters
Yeah, everything you do
Matters, in some way
