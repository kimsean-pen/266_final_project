If somehow I was standing
In your room without my boots
With your spider in my hand
And I look at you
And my skin is red
Yeah arm to arm and thigh to thigh
Even though there's plenty of room
And I look just like an owl
And you think that's just fine
But it doesn't matter, anyway
As long as we're together
I don't see what's wrong with that
That
As long as we're together
I don't see what's wrong with that
That
Well I don't think I'll be bitter
"Hey you must not know yourself very well"
You will be silent
For a few months
But all that shit he said
I don't know what I read
Yeah keep that sweatshirt wait outside
We've only ever talked
For what?
Seemed like an hour
But I was so happy
There must be common things
As long as we're together
I don't see what's wrong with that
That
As long as we're together
I don't see what's wrong with that
That
But only in my mind would I begin to think it true
