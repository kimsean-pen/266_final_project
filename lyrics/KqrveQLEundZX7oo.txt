Raise your fist
Smell the air
Taste the fame

We follow our hearts for
This time is fading

We nurture our minds
With a fake lullaby
In this world
Each to their own
Divided Paths
In Overcoming false hopes,
We enter the age of cycles

Freely we take to the air
Not knowing nor-
Caring the end

I won't forget today
It is burned inside
My Brain

We use memories to
Canvas our lives in
Colored means
This is all our
Destiny
In This world.
