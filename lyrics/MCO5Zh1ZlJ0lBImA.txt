Clouds of defiance
Over mankind they gently weep
To this verge I collapse
While God stays sound asleep

Losing the balance
I'm losing the hold of it all
Make these trembling ghosts
Not chase me anymore!

Stars shine brighter
Yet heavy lies the crown
Distant still clutching
In the blackness of it all
And the candles burns out
As I touch your heart -
For treading the footsteps
Of many sorrows passed

And I yearn for the sun to set,
For the curtain to fall
This is all I am...
All I have

Fallen from luster
To nothingness and scorn
And fall dark veil
Softly through the morn

A haunted, starless sky,
Fragile and oh so deep
The dying softly wakes
And smiles in painless peace

Fallen from luster;
To nothingness and scorn,
And fall dark veil;
Softly through the morn
And the drumless beat,
It dissolves into the mire -
But you are sleeping,
And a vacuum to my fire

And I yearn for the sun to set,
For the curtain to fall
This is all I am...
All I have

Fallen from luster
To nothingness and scorn
And fall dark veil
Softly through the morn

A haunted, starless sky,
Fragile and oh so deep
The dying softly wakes
And smiles in painless peace
