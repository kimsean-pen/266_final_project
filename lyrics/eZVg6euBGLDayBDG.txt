Rick's a blues guitar player
I met him one day in the

Baby, let me follow you down
Baby, let me follow you down
Well, I'd do anything in this God Almighty world

Baby, can I come home with you?
Yes, I'd do anything in this God Almighty world
If you just let me come home with you

Baby, let me follow you down
Baby, let me follow you down
And I'd do anything in this God Almighty world
If you just let me follow you down

Yes, I'd do anything in this God Almighty world
If you just let me follow you down
