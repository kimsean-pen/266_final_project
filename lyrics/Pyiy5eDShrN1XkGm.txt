When the bit pulls tight the grip is sewn into the reins.
Can't breathe it out, you'll just breathe it back again
You mental-pack your chambers full for no reason you can name,
A boil-in-bag blood supply you know it's murder on the veins.

Oh don't you feel it now?
Viva viva viva, life and limb.
Viva viva viva threatening.
Viva viva viva, life and limb.
Viva viva viva threatening.

Hey - we want our violence doubled (No but really in a loving way)
Hey - we want our violence doubled (No but really want it right away)
The national temper you know it's written on your face.
Etched and scratched and mirrored back.
Don't you know it's all the rage?
Don't you feel it now?

Viva viva viva, life and limb.
Viva viva viva, threatening.

Hey - we want our violence doubled (No but really in a loving way)
Hey - we want our violence doubled (No but really want it right away)
Right away.

Hey - we want our violence doubled (No but really in a loving way)
Hey - we want our violence doubled (No but really want it right away)
Hey - we want our violence doubled (No but really in a loving way)
Hey - we want our violence doubled (No but really want it right away)
