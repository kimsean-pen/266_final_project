Flare around the head
Or a part of the dead
A living seeing being
Full of variety
Heard the news to day
No more excuses
No path or a way
No futile words to say

Like a vision
Burns the skyline
No smoke no flames
In the skyline

Part of the shadow
Love is with dear light
Then they cease to be
And one is free
