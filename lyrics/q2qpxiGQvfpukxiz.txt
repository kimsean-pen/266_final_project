I think I'll borrow tomorrow's happiness for today
I leant on the cracks of all this love and it went away
Falling I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling down
Falling I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling down
Next to you

Put a string in the middle
And tie it to my chest
I'm spinning around
Your five mile radius
Don't look away
Falling I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling down
Falling I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling down
(Next to you)
I try to reach for the ceiling
Scared that I'm letting you down
Cause I'm so caught up on this feeling
This feeling
I keep
Falling I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling down
Falling I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling down
(Next to you)

Today now I'll swallowed
By all my sorrow and away
I'm losing myself
I'm nowhere now, can I stay?
Cause I believe that I have seen enough
And there's something that I've been dreaming of
(Next to you)
I try to reach for the ceiling
Scared that I'm letting you down
Cause I'm so caught up on this feeling
That heaven may never be found
And I try to reach for the ceiling
Knowing I'm letting you down
Cause I'm so caught up on this feeling
This feeling
I keep
Falling I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling down
Falling I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling down
Falling I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling down
Falling I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling down
(Next to you)
