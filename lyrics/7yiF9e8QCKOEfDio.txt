"The time will soon come when, if men will not learn that lesson
Then they will be taught it in blood and fire and anguish."

To tear down the sun
If only we could show the damned a great longing
To tear down the sun
We're drowning in shit, and no one ever stands

And who would have ---
What could have been?
Such longing destroyed
This end of the world
A fortune so sweet
