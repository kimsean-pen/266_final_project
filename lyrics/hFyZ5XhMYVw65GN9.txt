So tired of this heavy load.
I've been carrying it for so long.
I don't know what it wants with me.
Lord please let me be.

Rolling dice on my hotel room bed.
"Man, it feels so nice to love some one" she said.
"Cause when the evening comes I'm scared to be bad all by myself."
And I know exactly how it feels to be by myself.

And now she's singing,
"Happiness always scared me half to death.
Never had myself no lovin' to caress."
Little darling stop those tears and dry those eyes, I'm a be right here.
And I'd really love to stay tonight, if you'll have me here.

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Little girl you know I love you so.
Let's take it easy now and simmer down.
Little girl, let's take the long way home.
