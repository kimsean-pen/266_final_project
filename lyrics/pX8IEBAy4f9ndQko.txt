Come on, come on, shake your money maker.
Take, take your time, do it right tonight.
Double down another round, everybody wears a crown.
Waste of space on my face, heading into outer space.

City of sin, yeah we just can't deny it.
City of sin, yeah we just cannot fight it.
City of sin, raise a glass and let's toast to it.
We're singing, welcome to the city of sin.
(Sin, sin, sin, sin city of sin (x2)).

Come on, come on, meet me on the top floor (you know you wanna (x2)).
So dangerous, but I thirst for more (you know I want it (x2)).
Double down, jump around, everybody wears a crown.
Waste of space on my face, heading into outer space.

City of sin, yeah we just can't deny it.
City of sin, yeah we just cannot fight it.
City of sin, raise a glass and let's toast to it.
We're singing, welcome to the city of sin.

Sin, sin, sin, sin, city of sin.
Sin, sin, sin, sin.
City of sin.

City of sin, yeah we just can't deny it.
City of sin, yeah we just cannot fight it.
City of sin, raise a glass and let's toast to it.
We're singing, welcome to the city of sin. (Sin, sin)
Welcome to the city of sin. (Sin, sin)
City of sin.
