I met you outside that place
Where hookers used to be
Before they closed it down
And all became of STDS.

You told me that I'm for you
And that I'm just for you
Just a minor obsticle
A boyfriend maybe too.

I'm a man of patience baby
Just you wait and see
Time is almost 15.05
And then I want some tea

I will never love you
I will never love you
I will never love you
I will never love you

I've been dating nazi girls
Necromancer lords
None of them behared like you
You must have made it wrong

Now it's all on paper baby
You don't understand
Calling me from time to time
But now it has to end
