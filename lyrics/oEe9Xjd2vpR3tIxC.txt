Free to run

Free to run

Freedom run

Freedom run

No break through
I steal for you, I need you
And there's nothing you can do, yeah

Walked hundred miles of desert sun
To grasp the chance that I'll be gone
Be one with you, yeah

Freedom run
Freedom run
Freedom run

Well, I'll break through
Well, I steal for you, well, I need you
And there's nothing you can do, yeah

No form in past, I hope you last
You're in my grasp
I loved you, oh yeah

Freedom run
