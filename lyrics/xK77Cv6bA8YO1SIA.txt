If this is just another awkward conversation that we have
Let's leave it till the morning, I want to go home
Let's stay out and go dance, just not this

Oh you seem to change your mind in a heartbeat
But still you try to keep your arms somewhere around me
Well not like this, it's not how I operate

And I was patient as the next man I'd like to think
But not when answers can't be found
And I am open, I am open, but I might just close if-

You make it so hard to be around
You make it so hard to be around
It's no surprise that the cracks are showin'

You make it so hard to be around
You make it so hard to be around
It's no surprise that the line is breaking up

In the past we had fun, but not now,
You're serious and I'm serious,
That if we don't find our way back to how things were, we're done

Oh you seem to change your mind in a heartbeat
But still you try to keep your arms somewhere around me
And I am open, I am open, but I might just close if-

You make it so hard to be around
You make it so hard to be around
It's no surprise that the cracks are showin'

You make it so hard to be around
You make it so hard to be around
It's no surprise that the line is breaking up
And we're breaking up

So you'll have your disco moment alone
I'll stand at the side of your room
You're dressed tonight, I'm just a shadow that's flickering
And I am open, I am open, but I might just close if-

You make it so hard to be around
You make it so hard to be around
It's no surprise that the cracks are showin'

You make it so hard to be around
You make it so hard to be around
It's no surprise that the line is breaking up
And we're breaking up
