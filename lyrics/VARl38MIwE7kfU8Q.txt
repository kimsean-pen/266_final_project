When I give these books away
Will my ink betray me?
Will my stories resist wings and grow feet
And convince me that I'm boasting?
Or will my psalms seek the company of lonely breaths?
Will they inspire subtle lovers to
kiss with mouths they don't have yet?
Boy, whoever reads about how much I adore you
I hope my words bring them something new, something new

Ooh child bless your heart
Keep a tender heart
Heart
Heart

With you I can empty myself of all my rivers
And become a remarkable sky
How could I keep these love documents to myself?
How could I restrict what's given me life?
Today I'll find a kind and burrowing creature
That can carry these pages until browned
He'll recite the details of your love with his family
And what was once a whisper will become a deep rumbling sound

Ooh child bless ur heart
Keep a tender heart (I'll keep a tender heart)
Heart
Heart
Heart (Oh, I'll keep my tender heart)
Heart

Boy thank you for showing me how to be gentle (Heart)
(Heart) I have courage to share your love boldly
(Heart)
(Heart)
