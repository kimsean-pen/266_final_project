Clashes of thoughts, of desires and hope
lift you up, straight to the top of the world
With fluidity of energy in constant availability
All that glitters, all that matters beyond rivalries
Amplified universality, transcending dualities
Body chemistry, linked spiritually
Right in time every time, synchronized all along

Destiny, tomorrow is today
Destiny, without boundaries

How many nights will we spend together
traveling infinity back and forth and again?
How many times will we go together
questioning eternity about us about our wonders?

Step in, break through, take the stairs to the stars
Stretch out your life, make it big, make it large
Feed the space in-between, fill it up, make it real
Hell, you feel you're alive, you affirm your own will

It's been good all along and the best is to come
No fear, no doubt but the driving force to go on
Air's dry, we're wet, ain't seen nothing yet
Silence cried as we met, dig, dig our own depth

Destiny without boundaries

How many nights will we spend together
traveling infinity back and forth and again?
How many times will we go together
questioning eternity about us about our wonders?

How many nights will we spend together
traveling infinity back and forth and again?
How many times will we go together
questioning eternity about us about our wonders?

Clashes of thoughts, of desires and hope
lift you up straight to the top of the world
It's amazing how good things can be when it goes, when it flows
With fluidity of energy in constant availability
All that glitters, all that matters beyond rivalries
Amplified universality, transcending dualities
Body chemistry, linked spiritually
Right in time every time
Synchronized all along

How many nights will we spend together
traveling infinity back and forth and again?
How many times will we go together
questioning eternity about us about our wonders?

How many nights will we spend together
traveling infinity back and forth and again?
How many times will we go together
questioning eternity about us about our wonders?

Back and forth and again, back and forth and again
