Break em off some
Yeah

Good cop, good cop, rollin' with that bad cop
What you doing boy, turning that blood clart
Buck shot shot, they fire through the drug spot
Robots, can't give a damn who the fuck's shot
Clean cop, clean cop, fucking with that dirty cop
Don' act like yo ass never heard of that
Clean cop, Clean cop, rollin' with that mean cop
Still tryna' act proud as peacock
You know that mean cop might need a detox
Motherfucker' tryna blow me out my Reebox but I swing like Jack and the Beanstalk
Chop them down, when these bitches tryna lock me down
Hit the ground, hit the turf - walk the earth
Cube kidnap your mind, Patty Hearst
Bust a verse, that make your ass hit reverse
Kill the curse that was placed on the universe
West coast, war lord
Blacker, than the black knight
Fuck a black and white, the winner ain't actin' right
Good cop, good cop fillin' out your report
Bad cop asking you to distort
Bad cop asking you to lie in court
Send another young brother up north
Send another young sister off course
While these motherfuckers chill on the golf course

Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop

Lazy cop, fuckin' with that crazy cop
Always braggin, bout that new case they got
Do or die cop, with that suicide cop
Tell the truth cop, with that true or lie cop
Bro you fuckin' high cop, don't even try cop
Ain't no motherfuckin' drugs up in my spot
All you find in my closet is the high top, and my motherfuckin' tickets to the sky box
Hold up nigga, I'm a rider
Youse a roll up
Yep, dick controller
Make me mad, thats when I get swole up
The Incredible Hulk is bipolar
Come after cuffs, knock off the rust
Throw my hands up, you still wanna bust
The Trojan horse, is full of the sense of force?
When they try get aggressive, niggas off the porch

Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop

Good cop, good cop, where is your dignity?
Where's your empathy?
Where is your sympathy?
Bad cop, where's your humanity?
Good cop, is that just a fantasy?
Hell on that nigga, snitch on that bitch
Truth be told, motherfuck the blue code
Fuck the po-po actin' like Deebo
Already know Craig let the brick go
Black Lives Matter, it's not chit chatter
Cause all they wanna do, is scatter brain matter
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
A nine is terrible in your face
The mace has a fuckin' terrible taste
The pen is a fuckin' terrible place
The kings all hate the fuckin' ace
The judge sabotaged my fuckin' case
Racist motherfucker

Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop
