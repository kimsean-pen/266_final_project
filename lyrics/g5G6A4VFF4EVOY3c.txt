I see you and you see me
There's only one thing this could be
I think you know just what I mean
When I'm with you - I feel so free

So free

And I love you
And I hope you love me too
And I need you
And I hope you need me too

Babe, I just hope you know
To never let me go
Cause when it comes to forever
We should be together

When we meet and the whole world stops
The musics louder, the temperature drops
It seems like they're all dancing to our beat
Look around - I'll know, you'll see

You'll see

And I love you
And I hope you love me too
And I need you
And I hope you need me too

Babe, I just hope you know
To never let me go
Cause when it comes to forever
We should be together

And I love you
And I hope you love me too
And I need you
And I hope you need me too

Babe, I just hope you know
To never let me go
Cause when it comes to forever
We should be together

Babe, I just hope you know
To never let me go
Cause when it comes to forever
We should be together
