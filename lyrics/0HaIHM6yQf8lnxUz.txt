Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
Here come my man
Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
Here in my mind
Watch you fall away
I know
Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
See you cover death
I know
We're fine, you are blind
Caught it from behind
Feel you fall away
I know he's here to stay
Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
[...]
Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
What a world I [...]
Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
I thought I [...]
Everything I say
[...]
Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
[...]
[...]
And I know that he's gone away
