I'll call you sister Carrie but I'll never say it
Mute it to a whisper
And spin your solar sister
And magnet will deliver
An arrow from her quiver
I'll call you sister Carrie but you'll never hear it
Fifty minutes later
As time pulls down her fader
And nibbles off the fakers
Who roll under the breakers

I'll close my eyes and listen to you read the story
Knowning I'll soon be left behind
So won't you read sister Carrie Jean, sister Carrie
Always the patient one

I'll call you sister Carrie I won't breathe a word
Frosting on the beater
The flag trips down the meter
You thought you could defeat her
You're lucky you could meet her

I'll close my eyes and listen to you read the story
But I'm already far behind
So won't you read sister Carrie Jean, sister Carrie
Always the patient one

I'll close my life and let you teach me a new story
Out of the pages of your mind
And magnet will deliver
So, spin, my solar sister

And you can read, sister Carrie, read...
