The ceiling
It's higher than its even been
He doesn't even care

So tell me
Is it so hard to treat me better
You're lying to yourself

Dragging my feet around the carpet again and again
It makes me so sad

Breakfast feels like giving up again
Just sigh a little harder
The road is looking farther
It's in my head again

Mirrors don't just speak
Screaming it's a lie, screaming it's a lie
So sick of fighting a losing battle
Everyday

You can't have
Your happiness and eat it too
Why am I so full of hate
I'm so full of hate

It's getting old
Healing my emaciated soul
It's killing me inside

Dragging my feet around the carpet again and again
It makes me so sad so sad
No one tells me I'm losing grip of reality
It's like my mind has finally won me over
Breakfast feels like giving up again
Just sigh a little harder
The road is looking farther
It's in my head again

Mirrors don't just speak
Screaming it's a lie, screaming it's a lie
So sick of fighting a losing battle
Everyday

Dining with a straight face
Feeling like a hopeless case
Once again I am so consumed
Here I am still waiting for

The flowers to bloom
I am so consumed
Leave me be, just wait and see
Slowly regaining my sanity

Dining with a straight face
Feeling like a hopeless case
