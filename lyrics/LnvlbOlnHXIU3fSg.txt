Here in this room with you
Downstairs there is a party
But this is all I want to do
Been sipping this on for a minute
And I already know,
We ain't gonna take this slow

We've been riding
Now let me feel your body
Get into me

Ain't nobody gotta know, no, no
Ain't nobody gotta know, no, no, no

The mood is quiet, the music is loud
Can you break the silence and take me all the way?
You make me wanna stay
The mood is quiet, the music is loud
Can you break the silence and take me all the way?
You make me wanna

Ain't nobody gotta know, no, no
Ain't nobody gotta know, no, no
Ain't nobody gotta know, no, no, no
