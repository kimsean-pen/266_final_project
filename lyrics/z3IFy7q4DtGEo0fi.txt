I know we'll make it
I know we'll make it through, ooh
One thing's for certain, that I'll be here for you, ooh
Don't overthink it
Don't question what we do, ohh
One thing's a constant, that I'll be here for you, ooh

We all go through changes, run to different places
That doesn't mean that we have to part
And when you feel like nobody's on your side
Please believe I'm never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far

I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you (I will be here for you)

Whether it's sunshine, whether it be rain, ooh
We'll stand the pressure, I'll release the pain, ooh
We all go through changes, run to different places
That doesn't mean that we have to part
And when you feel like nobody's on your side
Please believe I'm never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far

I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
(I will be here for you)
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you

(I'll be here for you)
I will be here for you

I will be here for you

And when you're cast away and you feel alone, ooh
I'll try to find you
I'll try to guide you home

I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I will be here for you
