So far girlfriend, I know your secrets
Keep them again and again until the end
Unspoken, when I'm with you I believe
That you always seem to know just what I need

More important, than the go and coming
Of our menfolk and all those troubles
When I'm broken, we will always find a way
To help each other through another day
Another day, another day
No matter what the weather brings I know the same
Our path is laid, to brighter days
We will help each other through another day

Though our time is not always perfect
When it works out the rest is worth it
Make the effort, to see things eye to eye
And then our friendship means we're more than getting by
When I grow tired, you're on my side
We will help each other through another day

So glad you understand my world, my world
I'm always here for you girl so you know
You don't have to make it on your own

Here forever, we're gonna brave the storm together
To sunny weather
It's unspoken, we'll always find a way
To help each other through another day
Another day, another day
In the big world we're finding our own way
But here I stay, come what may
You can rely on me to listen all the way
'Cause here I'll stay
Come what may
And we will help each other through
another day
