Don't, don't regret it
No, don't forget it
Should I have said it?
I'm a cold shoulder to cry on
Not to rely on
Saw it coming a mile off
Yeah, I see you're worth knowing, that's what people believe
But from all my observations say your brother's a freak
Yeah, you know he don't get up at five, six days a week
You know
You don't see me like the others see me
She said you won't call it what it is
Holy water, I'm your mother's daughter
She said you won't call it what it is
So come on, open up your head
Don't, don't regret it
No, don't forget it
Should I have said it?
Yeah, his only fight is ever in the weekend wars
While his brother, mum and sister just look over his flaws
You know he's happy dying, if it's not for a cause
You know
You don't see me like the others see me
She said you won't call it what it is
Holy water, I'm your mother's daughter
She said you won't call it what it is
So come on, open up your head
I'm on your side
Through it
Through it
And every day that I get older I'm more a child inside my head
'Cause every time the party's over, I'm the last one left
And every day that I get older, I'm more a child inside my head
'Cause every time the party's over, I'm the last one left
You don't see me like the others see me
She said you won't call it what it is
Holy water, I'm your mother's daughter
She said you won't call it what it is
So come on, open up your head
