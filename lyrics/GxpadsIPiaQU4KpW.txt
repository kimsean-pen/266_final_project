She's got her head in the clouds
She's got the stars in her eyes
And she's dancing
With a dream in her heart
She's got the wind in her hair
Moonchild shining bright
And she's dancing
With a dream in her heart

Severina, Severina

She believes in angels
She believes in the will of the gods
And she's dancing
Amongst the magic dust
She believes in the midnight trance
She believes in 'love is the law'
And she's dancing
Amongst the magic dust

Severina, Severina

Star child
Baby born of heaven
Severina, Severina
Severina

She's got a heart full of promise
She's got her hand on her heart
And she's dancing
By the light of the moon
She's got a head full of secrets
Sworn to the faith of 'love under will'
And she's dancing
By the light of the moon

Severina, Severina

She's a gift from the gods
And she's dancing

Severina, Severina

Star child
Baby born of heaven
Severina, Severina
Severina
