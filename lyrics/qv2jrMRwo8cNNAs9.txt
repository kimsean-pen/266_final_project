See the man with the gun in his hand
Livin' in his own wasteland
He don't care 'bout the government
Unless it helps him get ahead

Have you seen how the rich live?
Have you seen the poor man beg?
Have you seen how people take?
Have you seen a heart break?

It's a dog eat dog world they all say
Have you made your kill day?
It's a dog eat dog world they all say
Have you made your kill today?

See the man now he's growin' old
Livin' his life just like a ghost
Did he look in your direction?
No, he's just checkin' his reflection

Have you seen how the rich live?
Have you seen the poor man beg?
Have you seen how people take?
Have you seen a heart break?

It's a dog eat dog world they all say
Have you made your kill day?
It's a dog eat dog world they all say
Have you made your kill today?

It's a dog eat dog world they all say
Have you made your kill day?
It's a dog eat dog world they all say
Have you made your kill today?

Have you made your kill today?
