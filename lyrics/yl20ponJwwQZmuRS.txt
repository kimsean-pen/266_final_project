April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
Holiday tables under the trees
April in Paris, this is a feeling
No one can ever reprise

I never knew the charm of spring
Never met it face to face
I never new my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace

Till April in Paris, whom can I run to?
What have you done to my heart?

April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
Holiday tables under the trees
April in Paris, this is a feeling
No one can ever reprise

I never knew the charm of spring
Never met it face to face
I never new my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace

Till April in Paris, whom can I run to?
What have you done to my heart?

One more time

April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
April in Paris

Just one more time

April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
April in Paris
