Called me by name â€“ I would raise all delight
And infame boring games
Live to survive and detect human rights
And fit with your aims
You're blaming me for impractical fight
Let's talk as grown men!
Try a fantastical ride through the night
Don't care how it ends

Knowing to die as the last kings of the world leaders and scouts
Spreading out and sowing dreams

We get out, cause you can light a fire
Twilight beams and turns us into saints

We are the Sinners - in lust and delight
Losers - who walks in the wild
Dreamers - kings of an upcoming reign
We are the last in line

Can be assured we would upgrade your life
Hight spirit, low cost
Comrades in passion spend number one dimes
They're not going to bust

Just get out, cause you can light a fire
What you see, you never forget

Kings of an upcoming reign
We are lost legend knights

We seem to drive the lost end of the road, when all gets down
Stay away from all bad dream!

Don't give up, cause you can light a fire
What you see, will never be forgot
