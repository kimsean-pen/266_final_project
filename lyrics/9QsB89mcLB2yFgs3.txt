Made of iron made of stone
I am shell and I am bone
Teach the Mother's skull away
I'll tell them now
I'll tell you all.

We have no tongue
We have no choice
Now I don't care
What He said was 'light', no.

Made of concrete made of gold
I am young and I am old
Preach the Son's eternity
You tell them lies
You tell them all

You are the child
You have no choice
Now I don't care
What He said was 'light', no.
