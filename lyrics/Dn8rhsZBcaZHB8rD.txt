I'm secure
When you tie me up
You're obsessed
With these chains of lust

To satisfy
I don't need a ring
I'm hypnotized
As I cry and scream

I'm on my knees
Will you make me yours
I bite my lip
Behind the closed doors
I will be good
For bruises and sores
You'll break me down
I'll always endure

The coldest touch
Burns my flesh
I feel your voice
Upon my neck

To crave your lips
I'm on the cusp
I won't get my way
As the leather cuts

I'm on my knees
Will you make me yours
I bite my lip
Behind the closed doors
I will be good
For bruises and sores
You'll break me down
I'll always endure

I'm on my knees
Will you make me yours
