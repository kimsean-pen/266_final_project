We ain't surprised

I don't see you anymore
So I go into your house
And I creep inside the door
And what do we do now?
You weren't appreciative
You want the sky, I can only give you clouds
You unappreciative
And now you treat me like I'm just a little stranger

I saw her again, the angel
Mom I saw her again
The one that asked to be free mom
Why can't other kids eat like I eat?
Caroline, that's not how the world works
It's not- goddamnit
Who's putting this fucking shit in your head?
You can't save the world Caroline!
But-but-but mom?
Caroline, it's not real
