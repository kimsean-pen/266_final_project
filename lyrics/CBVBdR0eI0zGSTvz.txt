Do you need to time to rest?
Does it take time to heal?
Will it help you feel better,
Knowing that I'll stay clear
Do I not know you the best?
Am I not always real?
Am I the great upsetter?
Do I not do what I want?
Not all that I want
I stay here

Do I not make your bed?
Do I not wake as soon as you awaken?
Isn't it blood I bled?
Do I not cast out all mistakes and

Do I bore you to death?
Tell me did I not forget to take in
Am I not filled with dread?
Do you not see all that I make?

CAST SPELLS WRITE CHEQUES

Would I not lay and press my chest against your chest?
Do I not tell you misbehave?

How much time have I spent
Tryna get through to you
Do what she will, I'll let her
Let me try somethin' new

How much love have I lent,
Can you repay me soon?
Am I the great forgetter?
I don't remember you,
I don't remember you,
you,
you...

(Do what she will, I'll let her)
