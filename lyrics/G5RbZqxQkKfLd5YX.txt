You've got to be careful because you
know, I mean even if kid, if a kid works
The kids got a job somewhere,
he's making 700 bucks a week so you know,
seven, five, about five grand, that's - nothing
The whole thing,
they made the system so you spin your
wheels, you're going all the way around
After you pay for the toys, your apartment,
your car, you're runnin' your bullshit, your honey

There's a smokestack in my mouth
I'm living on the couch in my step-cousins house
Trying's the first step to dyin'
Next thing you know you're cryin'

At the foot of your own grave
Temporary slave
Just for this one life, your first life
This one life, your first life

Wha- what, what do you hear on the street?
About what,
what's going on with the people and the power of the people?
Walking down
Well, he's part of the problem

Pluto and Mars
My head, my heart
The highway is the mercury in my veins
Toxic lunch I can't get enough
Someone give me a cardboard cut out of myself to punch

At the foot of my own grave
Temporary slave
Just for this one life, your first life
This one life, your first life
This one life, your first life
This one life, your first life

Woah

La la la la la la la, da ooh
La la la la la la la, da ooh
La la la la la la la, da ooh

Trying the first step to dying
Next thing you know your crying
Alone
