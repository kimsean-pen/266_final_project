I'm gonna hurt my baby tonight
If he don't come home on time
I'm gonna kill my baby tonight
This will forever be mine

I'm holding your hair
As your body sinks into my bed
Your eyes fall asleep
Maybe you don't see me

I'm holding your hand
Am I losing my man?

I'm gonna hurt my baby tonight
If he don't come home on time
I'm gonna kill my baby tonight
This will forever be mine

What am I to do
If I can't be with you?
