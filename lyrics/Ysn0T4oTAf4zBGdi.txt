Insane mankind be revealed
Master, destroyer, redeemer
Immortal thy will be done
Messiah, deceiver, ritual killer
Evoke the heavens eternal
In sickness darkness decays
Oblivion consumes my holy soul
In Hypnos, death of the world

Insane
I am the plague from barren womb
Is this mankind?
Insane
From barren womb
Is this mankind?
Insane

Insiminate your tortured flesh
Your name is call, I thee envoke
My extinction and my demise
Incinerate corrupted minds

Cult of none
The blackened sun
Nails are piercing your flesh
Heaven and earth converge
Abortion, embryonic death

Insane
I am the plague from barren womb
Is this mankind?
Insane
From barren womb
Is this mankind?
Insane
