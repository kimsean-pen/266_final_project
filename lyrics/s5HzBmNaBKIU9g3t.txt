When we all finally washed ashore
It was clear there was no one else around
We declared a national holiday
A chance to build it from the ground
So far away from everyone
And everything starts today

Keep it together
Can we keep it together
We're singing a new song now
And everything starts today

Can we rise? Can we get along alright?
Can we miss the storm that sucked the whole world in?
And the boats went out at night
And the choppers in the sky
They searched but they could find no trace of us
So far away from everyone
And everything starts today

Keep it together
Can we keep it together
We're singing a new song now
And everything starts today

The thunder struck, the clouds appeared
Our fearless crew was not prepared
And pretty soon the boats came for us
Half a million strong
We gathered arms and fired shells
We built a wall around ourselves
And pretty soon the spirit was a lot like
What it used to be back home

So far away from everyone
And everything starts today

Keep it together
Can we keep it together
We're singing a new song now
And everything starts today
