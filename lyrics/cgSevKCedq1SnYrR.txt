Slow, awaiting some of bones
Like water from a stone
I tried to find the answers
In refractions

Underneath, underneath the surface
Underneath, underneath the surface
I believe, I believe there's a purpose

I hope you know we all suffer
Slipping under but only on the inside
I really fair over taking
We are breaking but only on the inside
Can't you see that this is killing me
But only on the inside

Hope, is all we used to know
When reaping when we sow
I tried to find the harvest
And it found me

Underneath, underneath the surface
I believe, I believe there's a purpose

I hope you know we all suffer
Slipping under but only on the inside
I really fair over taking
We are breaking but only on the inside
Can't you see that this is killing me
But only on the inside

But only on the inside
Only on the inside

I hope you know we all suffer
Slipping under but only on the inside
I really fair over taking
We are breaking but only on the inside
Can't you see that this is killing me
Can't you see that this is killing me
But only on the inside
