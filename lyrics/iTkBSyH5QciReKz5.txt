I want it, to be over
Turn the boat around and bring that girl in
I stumble through the error
Hope deferred makes the heart sick sick sick
The circle, rules and ruins
Yet again we are on our own
I don't need your opinions
What I got is alright

I know you're bleeding baby,
But you're not bleeding blood
Blood

I need it, you never show me
Keep it in the back seat nice and sharp
Uneasy, in the daytime
How'd you feel alive if you cannot climb in
We aim to, make a difference
Get a sense of meaning from our time here
I don't need, your opinions
What I got is alright

I know you're bleeding baby
I know you're bleeding baby
But you're not bleeding blood
