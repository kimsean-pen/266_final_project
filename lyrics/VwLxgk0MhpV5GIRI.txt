When I was a boy I had a dream
All about the things I'd like to be
Soon as I was in my bed, music played inside my head
When I was a boy I had a dream
When I was a boy I learned to play
Far into the night and drift away
Don't want to work on the milk and the bread
Just want to play my guitar instead
When I was a boy I had a dream
And radio waves kept me company
In those beautiful days
when there was no money
When I was a boy
I had a dream
When I was a boy
I had a dream
Finding out what life could really mean
Don't want a job cause it drives me crazy
just wanna sing "Do you love me, baby"
When I was a boy I had a dream
And radio waves
Kept me company
In those beautiful days
When there was no money
When I was a boy
I had a dream
When I was a boy
