On a dark, desert night
Look into the sky, something ain't right
A fireball, red and grey

People start to look, frozen in fear
A man grabs a woman, draws her near
They fall to their knees and pray

All mighty God
Is it today?

Fireball, in the sky
Fireball, in the sky

Hey, little boy with a cowboy gun
His mom picks him up, he starts to run
He laughs out loud, he thinks it's a game

The alarm goes off in the liquor store
The trucks roll by with a thunderous roar
It fell from the sky, a silver rain

All mighty God
The city's in flames

All man alive
Can we survive?

My alarm goes off, I'm shaking with fright
But blood runs cold, teeth clench tight
But it's alright now, It's only a dream

Well I go to the window, lean on the sill
The night is hot, and all is still
There's a blinding flash and now it's real

All mighty God
We die today

Fireball, in the sky
Fireball, in the sky
Fireball, in the sky
Fireball, in the sky
Fireball, in the sky
Fireball, in the sky
Fireball, in the sky
