I tell you, I've seen the light
Somewhere in the shadows you appear
Wish I could make it right
So I can stop seeing your face in the mirror

I see your ghost at night
Every time I close my eyes
I see your ghost at night
Every time I close my eyes
I see your ghost at night
Every time I close my eyes
I see your ghost at night
Every time I close my eyes
I close my eyes

I see your ghost at night
Every time I close my eyes
I see your ghost at night
Every time I close my eyes
I close my eyes

I see your ghost at night
Every time I close my eyes
I see your ghost at night
Every time I close my eyes
I close my eyes

I see your ghost at night
I see your ghost at night
(Close my eyes)
I close my eyes
