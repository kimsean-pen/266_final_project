Go on now Scout and break with your man
Please understand that you're in command
Do it for me and do it for yourself, come on
Are you for real? Or are you a dream?
Scout is it you in this magazine
Looking so mean in faded jeans
I'm ready to die

I wake up in my car
I parked it not too far
From where I passed out
It's fucked and now I'm crying
Wish I never met you while buying
Shoes that I threw out
Reminded me of you Scout
Wanna take this memory
and strangle it to death
It's a mess I guess
Can't stress enough that I want you

Scout, when you have the time
To hear what I just said
I'm not some card you decline
I just can't be misread
I always wanted you
Just didn't know it
Didn't know it
Didn't know it
