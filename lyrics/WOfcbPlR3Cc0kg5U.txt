Never thought that I'd say
Wish I didn't love you ever since the first date
When you got close, my heart would just stop
Thought me and you together would end up on top

You changed me for better for worse
I know I was caught up
Always put you first, I never once thought
You would be triflin' but, oh, I was blinded

I was like, oh, oh, oh
Never wanna let you go, go, go
I was open before but now I know

Love made me blind, so I couldn't see
All the lies you told were right in front of me
Since love made me blind you made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind

I gave all of my trust, didn't think being faithful
Was asking too much but I'm good
Glad that I know now, I was fooled but fate
Let me see how

They say every tear has it's reasons
Every smile has it's own season
Never once thought you'd be this triflin'
But oh, I was blinded

I was like, oh, oh, oh
Never wanna let you go, go, go
I was open before but now I know

Love made me blind, so I couldn't see
All the lies you told were right in front of me
Since love made me blind, you made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect, when it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind, love made blind
Love made me blind, your love made me blind

'Cause when I, I felt your lips pressed against mine
But the sweet smell of your perfume was all mine
They didn't know you were a beautiful liar
Cause love made me blind
Love made me blind so I couldn't see
All the lies you told were right in front of me
Since love made me blind, you made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect, when it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind, your love made me blind
Your love made me blind, your love made me blind...
