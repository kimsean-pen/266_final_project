Call me all, but not alone
Call me frozen, I've traveled through a storm
And in a way I wasn't free
Never knew, but now it's all that's left of me

Give it all or never
You show the way that you feel
And if it matters to you
It must matter to me

It's all that matters
You show, you better believe
And if it matters to you
You know it matters to me

You won't grow, if you don't feel
When it's cold you know there's nothing in between
And I'll be there, I won't pretend
I'd give it all for you, I'd give it all again

Give it all or never
You show the way that you feel
And if it matters to you
It must matter to me

It's all that matters
You show, you better believe
And if it matters to you
You know it matters to me

I'm guilty of silence, I'm guilty of hiding my soul
I can't fight the regret, I remember oh how I was wrong
In the dark of the night
I look up in the sky
And you're gone
Now I'm down on my knees
Begging you
Let me fall

Give it all or never
You show the way that you feel
And if it matters to you
It must matter to me

It's all that matters
You show you better believe
And if it matters to you
You know it matters to me

It's all that matters
You show the way that you feel
And if it matters to you
It must matter to me

It's all that matters
You show you better believe
And if it matters to you
You know it matters to me
