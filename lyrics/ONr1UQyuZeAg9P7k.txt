I was born in a small village
I was still a child when we were raided by soldiers
Foreign soldiers
Torn from my elders I was made to speak their language
With each new post, my master's changed
Along with the words they made me speak
With each change, I change too
My thoughts, personality, how I saw right and wrong
Words can kill
