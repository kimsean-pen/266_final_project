Ooh...

Love of mine
Won't you lay by my side
And rest your weary eyes
Before we're out of time?

Give me one last kiss
For soon, such distance
Will stretch between our lips
Now the day's losing light

Ooh...

Bring me your love tonight
Bring me your love tonight

Lost at sea
My heartbeat was growing weak
Hoping you'd hear my plea
And come save my life

As the storm grew fierce
An angel was certainly near
I knew there was nothing to fear

Bring me your love tonight
Bring me your love tonight
No, I am not where I belong
Bring me your love tonight

No, I am not where I belong
So shine a light and guide me home
No, I am not where I belong
So shine a light, guide me back home

Ooh...
