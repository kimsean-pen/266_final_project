Tonight I feel ambitious
And so does my foot
As it sinks on the pedal
I press it to the floor

I don't need a girl
Don't need a friend
'Cause my friend lonesome's unconditional

We're flying forever bored
And for a moment I love everything
That I see and think and feel
I love my broken side view mirror

'Cause it's so perfect
I'm so perfect
You're so perfect
You're not here

I hear the change in gears
My pile shakes as I hit eighty on the open road
This is an open road song
The night is beckoning
Although I have nowhere to go but home
Feels good to be alone
With every turn comes a new frame of mind
If I could frame my mind
Where would it hang?

My pile shakes as I hit eighty on the open road
My pile shakes as I hit eighty on the open road
My pile shakes as I hit eighty on the open road
This is an open road song

I crack a window and feel the cool air cleanse my every pore
As I pour my poor heart out
To a radio song that's patient and willing to listen
My volume drowns it out
But that's O.K.
'Cause I sound better than him anyway any day
Yeah my voice is sweet as salt
I search for comfort and I find it
Where I've found it many times before
Times before can be forgotten

My pile shakes as I hit eighty on the open road
My pile shakes as I hit eighty on the open road
My pile shakes as I hit eighty on the open road
This is an open road song
