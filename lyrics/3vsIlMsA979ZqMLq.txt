I told my girl i can't see the lights
Take my hand and it'll be all right
Shoulda never gone out tonight
I can't find my way home
I can't find my way
Walk alone and it's hard to breathe
Take a hit I'm fallin to my knees
Somebody is following me
Brother laughing at me on the phone
Let's go to the unknown
Can't wait to be alone
I can't find my way home
I can't find my way home
I can't find my way home
I can't find my way
Gotta find a place to sleep
Skid row lost a couple teeth
Somebody is following me
Woke up in my dealer's car
Tattoo on my arm
F-I-D-L-A-R
I can't find my way home
I can't find my way home
I can't find my way home
I can't find my way
