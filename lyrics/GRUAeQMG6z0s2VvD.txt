Maybe I'll get hit by a bus
While I was dreaming of falling in love
Or maybe I'll fall in love
And die of a broken heart

I always try to say my goodbyes
When death is in the back of my mind
I hope blood doesn't get
All over my favorite shoes

Maybe I'll get hit by a car
Or you can shoot an arrow straight through my heart
Cause maybe I'll fall in love
And die of a broken heart

I always try to say my goodbyes
When death is in the back of my mind
I hope blood doesn't get
All over my favorite wig

I never wanted you to go
I never thought that it would end this way
You never wanted me to go
I always knew my life would end this way
