To the north part of it
The country I was made to
Cause were you been I go
That's where you'll always go
I'm banging on your door
Up in the big blue sky
When you let the water in
When you let the water in, yeah
When you let the water in
On the side that's up
When you let the water in
When you let the water in
On the side that's up
Oh yeah, I'm on the dot
I'm always there in turn
