Feeling out of touch, lost my way
No one ever asked me why
Tried to move along, never looking back
You're gonna come around in time

Alone
Alone
Alone now my friend
Alone
Alone
Alone now my friend

Talking to the walls
Now my shadows gone
Too much time to pretend
There's nothing wrong

So Lonely
So Lonely
So Lonely now, my friend

Oh, So Lonely
So Lonely
So lonely now, my friend

I don't want to feel this way
Although it is true when they say
It's good for you to be alone
But you can't learn it all on your own

Lonely
So Lonely
So Lonely now, my Friend
Lonely
So Lonely
So lonely has become my Friend
