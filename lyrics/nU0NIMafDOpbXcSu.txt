Today I walked down our old street
Past the diner where we'd meet
Now I dine alone in our old seats
The cold wind blows right through my bones
And I feel like I'm getting old
But I wish I was getting old with you

I held your hand when we took shelter from the rain
She laughed as we picked out our children's names

White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart I kneel and pray

Her clothes hang in the closet still
The phone sits on the windowsill
And every time it rings it gives me chills
My heart just stopped when I was told
Doctor, doctor, on the phone
Said my love was never coming home

I hold your casket gently walking to the grave
Dark clouds eclipse, the sun won't shine again

White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart I kneel and pray
They gave her one more day, to say the words I couldn't say
I'm crying in pain, crying in pain
Our love will remain, I'm crying in pain
And I'm not looking for answers
No I'm not looking for answers
But dear God, why did you choose her?
White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart I kneel and pray
They gave her one more day, to say the words I couldn't say
I'm crying in pain, crying in pain
Our love will remain, I'm crying in pain
