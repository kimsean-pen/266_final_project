Yeah, I know how we are
Haven't been doing good for awhile
But I just need somebody (need somebody)
So I came to you to cry about
The things that pull me down
But you blame it on insecurities (insecurities)

See, I know, I know
I know, you know my weakness
But you didn't have to rub it in
Right now to remind me (don't remind me)
You said you meant me well with your affection
So I guess there's a glitch in transaction
Some kind of miscalculation

Baby, I am sorry
I just want to hurt you back
I just want to hurt you back
I just hurt you back
I know I'm kind of selfish
I just want to hurt you back
I just want to hurt you back
I just

I just
I just
I just
I just hurt you back
I just
I just
I just
I just hurt you back

See, I wish, I was calm
Spilling words, like haze getting
Getting poisonous thoughts off my chest (thoughts off my chest)
And I like your honesty
But I didn't think I need affection
A fraction of apology, could set us free

See, I know, I know
I know, you know my weakness
But you didn't have to rub it in
Right now to remind me (don't remind me)
You said you meant me well with your affection
So I guess there's glitch in transaction
Some kind of miscalculation

Baby, I am sorry
I just want to hurt you back
I just want to hurt you back
I just hurt you back
I know I'm kind of selfish
I just want to hurt you back
I just want to hurt you back
I just hurt you back

I just
I just
I just
I just hurt you back
I just
I just
I just
I just hurt you back
