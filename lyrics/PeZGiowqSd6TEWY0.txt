Should I defend you for who you are?
The laws are changed and useless
On their way to a deserted town
Where empty windows wave goodbye

A helpless excuse, a fallin' reality
I'm changed by the shock
And the weight of the punch
A helpless excuse, a fallin' reality

Fragments of a futile bein'
A puzzle to the noble ones
Ignorant and pitiless they stride

The world around me
Spartanic, minimalistic
A helpless excuse, a fallin' reality
The large scale plan that once where
You've now drained from life
A helpless excuse, a fallin' reality

Who knows the proper reasons
Why it all begins and ends?
Ignorant and pitiless they stride

You are my form
The clean, harsh silence passes
Genuine visions
By the noble ones
For the noble ones

You are my form
The clean, harsh silence passes
Genuine visions
By the noble ones
For the noble ones
