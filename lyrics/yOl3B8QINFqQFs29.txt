Have you ever been (have you ever been)
To Electric Ladyland?
The magic carpet waits for you (for you)
So don't you be late, baby no
I wanna show you different emotions
I wanna run through sound and emotions
Electric woman waits for you and me
So it's time we take a ride
Cast our hang-ups over the seaside
And while we fly right over the love filled sea
Look up ahead, I see the loveland
Do you understand?

Make love, make love, make love, make love

Have you ever been (have you ever been)
To Electric Ladyland?
The magic carpet waits for you
So don't you be late

I wanna show you
Angels gonna spread their wings
I wanna show you
Good and evil laying side by side
While electric love penetrates the sky

I wanna show you love
Electric woman waits for you and me
So it's time we take a ride
Cast our hang-ups over the seaside
And while we fly right over the love filled sea
Look up ahead, I see the loveland
Do you understand?

Make love, make love, make love, make love

Have you ever been
(have you ever been)
