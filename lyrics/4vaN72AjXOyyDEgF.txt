Minor chords the major I can't open
Little leather jacket and a black bandana
Kickin' over trash cans and telling jokes in Atlanta
When I got the fever
You hit me like a fan on the back
With my hand I don't know who I am
But I'm free for nothing, good for nothing too
Crazy dreams still crazy bout you
Won't you let me in one more time
Babe I want to feel it too
Well nothing isn't love babe
If you know it ain't true

Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now

Reparations now coming my way
Dues that I have recollected that I never paid
In the stained glass windows babe I feel the presence, oh yeah
But that don't mean I'm done with repentance oh no
Gonna find another way to climb outta this basement
Gonna find out what that smile on your face meant
Like a thief that you borrowed baby take hold of me take flight
And I wanna do your bidding babe
I wanna steal away in the night

Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now

Heart's on fire and so is the page
Everybody round here's telling me to act my age, I'm trying
Things are only revealed
In the life that is given, oh
To be free from the body when all else is forgiven
Rain outside's blowing in the curtains
Nothing is revealed but nothing is for certain
As I recall you was drinking from the sanctuary wine
Well don't worry baby
We'll find all of our lost time

Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now

As I recall you were standing there
You was holding your rosary beads
Everyone around you seems to think he knows what he needs
Seven ugly reasons kept me away from you then
Nothing is much weaker than the resolve of most men
I remember when we was alone in your room
Staring out your window we knew you'd be going soon
And I was so young babe
I hoped that you knew that I meant well
And when I looked in your eyes
I thought I knew you could tell
Now I'm going back from the cemetery gates
You who I loved dearly now I must wait
To be reunited in the sky when it opens
Well, my feet are so tired baby
But my spirit ain't broken

Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
