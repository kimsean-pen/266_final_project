I don't know how we were created,
But I know that, I know we all die, know we all die.
Go pick up all your tools and build a roof,
I'll pick up all mine and build one too,
I just do as I do,
Yeah, I do as I please,
And that's all I can do.

I don't know how we were created,
But I know that, I know we all die, know we all die.
Listen to the cars just passing through,
Help out all those friends that helped you too,
You just do as you do,
Yeah, you do as you please,
And that's all you can do.
And that's all you can do.

I don't know how we were created,
But I know that, I know we all die, know we all die.
Open up your arms and hold on to
Everything you own that owns you too,
And just let it all go,
'Cause we do as we please,
And that's all we can do.
That's all we can do.

I don't know how we were created,
But I know that, I know we all die, know we all die.
And that's all we can do.
