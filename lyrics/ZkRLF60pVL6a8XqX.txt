H-a-a-a-a
Shadows falling baby we stand alone
Out on the street anybody you meet
Got a heartache of their own
(it oughta be illegal)
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad
(it oughta be illegal)
You got a reason for livin'
You battle on with the love you're livin' on
You gotta be mine we take it away
It's gotta be night and day just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we...
Got a highway to the sky
I don't wanna hear your goodbye
A-a-a-h...
O-o-o-h... w-o-o-o... o-o-o-h...
Pulse's racing darling how grand we are
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark
(it oughta be illegal)
Make it a crime to be out in the cold
(it oughta be illegal)
You got a reason for livin'
You battle on with the love you're buildin' on
You gotta be mine we take it away
It's gotta be night and day just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
E-y-e-s (eyes) can see
That we (that we) that we got a highway to the sky
I don't wanna hear your goodbye
Don't wanna hear your goodbye
I don't wanna hear your
And we got nothing and we got nothing to be guilty of
(our love) Our love will climb any mountain
Near or far near or far
We are (we are) and we never let it end
Oh... we never
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for sorry for
(our love) Our love is one in a million
E-y-e-s (eyes) can see
That we (that we) that we got a highway to the sky
We got a highway we got a highw... ay
Don't wanna hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
(our love) Our love will climb any mountain
Near or far, oh
We are
That we
And we never let it end
