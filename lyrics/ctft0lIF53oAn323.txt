They said when I was young I,
had some kind of sickness.
See how I have weathered.
You tell me if I'm better.

If my mother had her way her,
son would be a preacher.
You lookin' for redemption,
Were bringin' that old fashioned healin'

Don't make me put 'em up,
Don't make me put 'em up.
You won't like me.

Don't make me put 'em up,
Don't make me put 'em up.
It's not like me.

Boys will be boys,
who like boys,
who dress like girls,
and that's alright.

We're hangin' with the boys that look like girls tonight.

Girls will be girls,
who like girls,
who dress like boys,
and start up fights.

We're hangin' with the girls that look like boys alright.

Don't make me put 'em up,
Don't make me put 'em up.
You won't like me.

Don't make me put 'em up,
Don't make me put 'em up.
It's not like me.

If my mother had her way her,
son would be a preacher.
You lookin' for redemption,
I bring that old fashioned healin'.

I don't care if you're a Christian,
or a Hare Krishna.
Who gave you the right to,
judge another's lover?

Now's the time for changing,
So keep the hate from creepin' in.
'Cause the bed that you're building,
is the one you gonna sleep in.

Don't make me put 'em up,
Don't make me put 'em up.
You won't like me.

(so c'mon c'mon c'mon)

Don't make me put 'em up,
Don't make me put 'em up.
It's not like me.

Boys will be boys,
who like boys,
who dress like girls,
and that's alright.

We're hangin' with the boys that look like girls tonight.

Girls will be girls,
who like girls,
who dress like boys,
and start up fights.

We're hangin' with the girls that look like boys alright.

Don't make me put 'em up,
Don't make me put 'em up.
