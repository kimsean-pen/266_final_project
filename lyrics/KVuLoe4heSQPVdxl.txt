Stephanie McIntosh Lyrics

Tightrope

I keep dreaming
That I'm falling
There's no safety net
You look up with
Arms wide open
Then you smile and walk away

I guess that Freud would have an answer
He'd say that I was twisted and confused and just insane
(Couldn't blame him)
I feel like lately all the things I took for granted
Flipped and changed
Now I'm loosing grip again...

Ohh Ohhh
I'm walking the tightrope between who I love
And what I know
Ohh Ohhh
I'm watching the sharks
Lick there lips as they circle
Far be-low

I'd slip my skin and loose this face
If we could find a secret place to hide
Say the words I need to hear and
I would leave it all be-hind

My physcic says she sees disaster
My heart is begging that I take a giant leap of faith
oh woah
See are you really worth the risk of losing everything I have
For what might be one stupid kiss?

Ohh Ohhh
I'm walking the tightrope between who I love
And what I know
Ohh Ohhh
I'm watching the sharks
Lick there lips as they circle
Far be-low

I don't know why it is that you won't say you love me
I don't know what it is

I keep slipping back to you
When you're no good for me
I keep wanting what I can't have
Mr. Freud would you disagree?

Ohh Ohhh
I'm walking the tightrope between who I love
And what I know
Ohh Ohhh
I'm watching the sharks
Lick there lips as they circle
Far be-low

Ohh Ohhh
I'm walking the tightrope between who I love
And what I know
Ohh Ohhh
I'm watching the sharks
Lick there lips as they circle
Far be-low

I don't know why it is
That you would say you love me
I don't know what it is
But this tightrope's got me!
