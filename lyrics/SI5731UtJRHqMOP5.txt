I made a friend in California
He has a house in West LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA
I made a friend in Venezuela
A broken home but he's okay-kay-kay-kay-kay-kay-kay-kay
I made a friend in New York City
I haven't heard from him in days-days-days-days-days-days-days-days
I made a friend in North Korea
She said we have to meditate-tate-tate-tate-tate-tate-tate-tate
And we, agree, we are
Together
At peace, at peace, we are
Forever
I walked along the Himalayas
I never made it to the peak-peak-peak-peak-peak-peak-peak-peak
I walked the greatest wall of China
The ground had never touched my feet-feet-feet-feet-feet-feet-feet-feet
I spent a week in North Sahara
I spent a decade lost at sea-sea-sea-sea-sea-sea-sea-sea
And I was never disappointed
Cause everything was meant to be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be
And we, agree, we are
Together
At peace, at peace, we are
Forever
You are the future, let 'em know
That you know, forever!
You see a broken man, take 'em by the hand
And just help them understand, and nah nah nah nah
I said you see a broken man, take 'em by the hand
And just help them understand, and nah nah nah nah
I said you see a broken man, take 'em by the hand
And just help them understand, and nah nah nah nah
I have some friends who are the future
They need this world much more than me
