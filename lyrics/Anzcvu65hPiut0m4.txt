So are we made just to fight
All our lives
End it all on the bottom line
Hold back my hair, why you kiss my face
When I lay my body down
I erase your place
Hold back my hair, why you kiss my face
When I lay my body down
I erase your place

Who am I
He heard me
Who am I
He heard me
Who am I

Heard my name and it changed that day
So are we made just to fight
All our lives
End it all the bottom line
So are we made just to fight
All our lives
Chain my name, chain my name
Chain my name, chain my name beside you

So are we made just to fight
All our lives
Chain my name, chain my name
Chain my name, chain my name beside you
Not this time
Not this time
Please, not this time

Who am I
He heard me
Who am I
He heard me
Who am I

Heard my name and it changed that day
So are we made just to fight
All our lives
End it all the bottom line
So are we made just to fight
All our lives
Chain my name, chain my name
Chain my name, chain my name beside you

All our lives
Chain my name, chain my name
Chain my name, chain my name beside you
Beside you

Not this time
Don't make it easier on me
Have you had enough
Please
Don't make it easier on me
No, I can't be trusted with love

So are we made just to fight
All our lives
Chain my name, chain my name
Chain my name, Chain my name beside you
So are we made just to fight
All our lives
Chain my name, chain my name
Chain my name, chain my name beside you
Not this time
