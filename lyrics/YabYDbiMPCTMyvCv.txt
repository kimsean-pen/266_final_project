Got 20 pound note, rolled up
Rolled up a lil, squashed in my pocket
Don't you give me those eyes
We can stop by the shop, get some rum if you want it
I'm tired tryna fight it and fight you
Fight this and fight it all
Let's get up out the rain
Get a cab to my house, we can snuggle up

It's yours
All yours
It's yours
All yours

Got your hands on my head
And the door starts to ring, I'm guessing that's the pizza
We'll let it quit up in the cold
Cause all that I want is a piece now of you're love, hold us
I'm tired tryna fight it and fight you
Fight this and fight it all
Let's get out the rain
Get a cab to my house, we can snuggle up

It's yours
All yours
It's yours
All yours
