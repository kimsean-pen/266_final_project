You got a job, make money money money mula
Number one, one, you deserve a high five
You put your pants on, got some hair done
Talk a dirty dancing, high five

You made a friend, got a party in the west town
Slept on a bench, yeah you deserve a high five
You feeling fresh poppin' all these breathmints
Get a little tongue twist, high five

Macho macho man, high five

You put your pants on, got some hair done

You made a friend, friend
You got laid, at a party in the west town

I've been talking a lot,
and I know you must be thinking that I'm calling the shots
I can miss all, I'm almost drinking connecting the dots
Connecting the dots, and poppin' the pops
