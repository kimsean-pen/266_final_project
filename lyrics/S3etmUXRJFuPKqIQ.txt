When I was still growing up and dad headed off to work
He put coat and tie on over a fitted shirt
Nothing else would fit right
All seams so directly apply
The fitted shirt hung on me
Fitted shirt alright
I long for the days they used to say
Ma'am and yes sir
Now I'm going to find buttons for my
Dad's old used shirt
Fitted shirt
Fitted shirt
Been looking so long now
And no one's seen and no one's heard
When I go out tonight
I'm gonna put on a fitted shirt
One day it'll take and they'll start to make
Shirts that fit right
Till then i supose I still got dad's clothes
And that's alright
Fitted shirt (x7)
