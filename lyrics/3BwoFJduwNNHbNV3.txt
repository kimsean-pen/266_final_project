I'm trying to sell you another lie
You already bought too many
You can see it through my disguise
And I'm caught already

I don't know why I do these things
Guess I love your jealousy
Should've left but I did it again
Now it all fires back at me

And I can't break your wall
I know I went too far

I should've gone home
How hard can it be to say "no"?
I should've gone home
How hard can it be to say "no"?

She found me standing at the bar
Spending all my money
She must've thought that I was a star
The way she jumped right at me

I'm addicted to this game
Wish I could just let it be
Should've left but I did it again
Now it all fires back at me

And I can't break your wall
I know I went too far

I should've gone home
How hard can it be to say "no"?
I should've gone home
How hard can it be to say "no"?

Feels like I've been looking everywhere
Just to find out that it's you
Feels like I've been looking everywhere
Just to find out that it's you

I'm trying to sell you another lie
You already bought too many

I should've gone home
How hard can it be to say "no"? No

I should've gone home
(Should've left while I could but I didn't)
How hard can it be to say "no"?
(No no no, no no no)

I should've gone home
(I should've gone home, I should've gone home)
How hard can it be to say "no"?
(No no no, no no no)

Oh, feels like I've been looking everywhere
Just to find out that it's you
Feels like I've been looking everywhere
Just to find out that it's you

I should've gone home
