You're my strongest weakness
In withdrawals, I need it
You're my secret fix
You're my secret fix
Need you more than breathing
I was broke, you healed me
Ain't no drug like this
No, no drug like this

Don't you think it's time
We crossed the lovers line?
Baby, say you'll be mine

If you're up for it
I'm all yours now
If you're up for it
I'm down
If you're up for it
I'm all yours now
If you're up for it
I'm down, I'm down for you

(Are you up for it?)
The only one I want is you
(Are you up for it?)
The only one I want is you
(Are you up for it?)
The only one I want is you
(Are you up for it?)
I said the only one I want is you

Every time I see you
Instant amnesia
Can't remember life before you
Or anyone before you (Ayy)
My midnight daydreams
Ain't PG-13
'Cause I got my hands on you
I want my hands on you

Don't you think it's time
We crossed the lovers line?
Baby, say you'll be mine

If you're up for it
I'm all yours now
If you're up for it
I'm down (I'm down)
If you're up for it
I'm all yours now (I'm all yours, I'm all yours)
If you're up for it
I'm down, I'm down for you

(Are you up for it?)
The only one I want is you
(Are you up for it?)
The only one I want is you
(Are you up for it?)
The only one I want is you
(Are you up for it?)
The only one I want is you

I wanna be the one you want
I wanna be the one you want
Oh yeah, babe
I wanna be the one you want
I wanna be the one you want
(Say) I wanna be the one you want
I wanna be the one you want
Woah
I wanna be the one you want
I wanna be the one you want

If you're up for it
I'm all yours now
If you're up for it
I'm down
If you're up for it
I'm all yours now
If you're up for it
Baby, I'm down for you

(Are you up for it?)
The only one I want is you
(Are you up for it?)
The only one I want is you
(Are you up for it?)
The only one I want is you
(Are you up for it?)
The only one I want is you
