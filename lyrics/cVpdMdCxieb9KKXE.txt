Oh Sarah
Did you go to God again to change your name
Oh Sarah
Did you try wipe the pale from off your face
Did you try to take the will from out the wave

Oh Sarah
Did you go to ground again in someone's place
Oh Sarah
Did you try to wipe the frail from your face
Did you try the frail from off your frame
Did you try to take the will from out the wave

Oh my heart
my heart is older now
and how
how it never ends

Oh Sarah
Did you go to ground again for both our sakes
Oh Sarah
Did you try to wipe the freckles from your face
Did you try to take the will from out the wave
Did you try to take the will from out the wave

Oh my heart
my heart is older now
and how
how it never ends
And gone and gone
