Hey did you hear me Mom?
Baby's headed home.
Against your wishes I went
into the woods alone.
Just look at my face, a vegetable
beet red
I know you
gave me money fro the motel, but
I came here instead
I came here instead
What I wanted when I left you
brushed by, so close
With the money I got pretty gone
and bloodied some poor actor's nose
One night in the park, the pellet gun
took out an eye
I came undone
One college kid came to see me
He passed me that nylon string
asked me to play him something
So I tried my hand at "Blues Run the Game"
I barely made it through it
then he had to go back to his
parents' house upstate
Woke up from the dream and I was old
Staring at the asscrack of dawn
walked these streets up and down
looking for Paul Simon.
All I found was myself
lost in time I tried
singing some songs but I
lost my mind
What have they done
With my jealous one?
Who is gonna talk trash
long after I'm gone?
When I was young they used to
find me pitching horseshoe crabs
back into the sun.
