At the end of every season I'm spent up
Keep thinking this will be the one
Hesitation lingers till I'm unreasonable
As if you care, I know you got your own stuff
Going on

You must be having so much fun
Everything's amazing
You're so subservient I make myself sick
Are you listening?

Can we talk about it once we've slept
And when can we, yeah, can we work it out?
Meditation just makes you more strung out
I wish you had a guru who told to let it go
To let it go

You must be having so much fun
Everything's amazing
You're so subservient I make myself sick
Are you listening?

You don't have to pretend you're not scared
Everyone else is just as terrified as you
Medication just makes you more upset
I bet you got a lot to prove
I know you're still the same
Still the same

You must be having so much fun
Everything's amazing
You're so subservient I make myself sick
Are you listening?
You must be having so much fun
Everything's amazing
You're so subservient I make myself sick
Are you listening?
