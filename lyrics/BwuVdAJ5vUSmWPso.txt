Don't, don't you look back
Don't you fade away, don't fade white to black
Love brings me happiness
I can't complain
Just because I'm insane

'Cause I still believe love songs are "saves"
Like cupid doves flying wild in the ways
They don't look back

Don't, don't you look back
Don't you fade away, don't fade white to black
Love brings me happiness
Just can't complain
Just because I'm insane

and I still believe love songs are "saves"
Like cupid doves flying wild in the ways
They don't look back

Don't, don't you look back
Don't you fade away, don't fade white to black
Love drove me you
I don't wanna blame
'Cause you drove me insane

I still believe love songs are "saves"
Like cupid doves flying wild in the ways
They don't look back
