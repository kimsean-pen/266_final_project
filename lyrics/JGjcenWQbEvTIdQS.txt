(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)

When I was born a little premature
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
Momma just couldn't take no more
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
Had no time to learn to cry
Goodbye mama got to fly
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)

Entered school when I was two
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
P H D'd that afternoon(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
Never entered any sports
I didn't look too good in shorts
Got divorced when I was four
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)

Well I've seen everything there is
I've done everything there is
I've met everyone but Liz
Now I've even met old Liz

No time for relationship
Skip the foreplay let 'er rip
You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock
You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock

(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)

(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)

When I did lots of traveling
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
Parts of me unraveling
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
The army then rejected me
Said I had two flat feet
Wore them out when I was three
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)

Too bad there ain't ten of you
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
Then I'd show you what I'd do
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
I could cheat on five of you
And be faithful to you two
But there's only one of you
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)

Well I've seen everything there is
I've done everything there is
I've met everyone but Liz
Now I've even met old Liz

No time for relationship
Skip the foreplay let 'er rip
You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock
You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock

(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
(You gotta beat the clock, you gotta beat the clock)
You gotta beat the clock
