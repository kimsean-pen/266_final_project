veins and veils have their place
as a way out of our past mistakes
veins and veils have their place
as a way out of our past mistakes
bring brave got in the way
of recognizing missteps we've made
so we said goodbye to moonlit eyes
and met the morning and its flood of light
gripped the thorns of the rose
cherished the beautiful pain it holds
something so fragile and flawed
at least we know it's pure
veins and veils have their place
as a way out of our past mistakes
veins and veils have their place
as a way out of our past mistakes
being brave got in the way
of recognizing missteps we've made
so we said goodbye to moonlit eyes
and met the morning and its flood of light
gripped the thorns of the rose
to cherish the beautiful pain it holds
something so fragile and flawed
at least we know it's pure
blood in my veins
says it's never too late
blood in my veins
says it's never too late
veins and veils have their place
as a way out of our past mistakes
veins and veils have their place
as a way out of our past mistakes
