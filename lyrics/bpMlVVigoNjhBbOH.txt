Mmmm

I've never been the kind that you'd call lucky
Always stumbling around in circles
But I must have stumbled into somethin'
Look at me
Am I really alone with you?

I wake up feeling like my life's worth livin'
Can't recall when I last felt that way
I guess it must be all this love you're givin'
Never knew, never knew it could be like this...
But I guess...

Some hearts...
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side
Some hearts...
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes
Some hearts just get lucky
Lucky sometimes...

Now who'd have thought someone like you could love me
You're the last thing my heart expected
Who'd have thought I'd ever find somebody
Someone who, someone who makes me feel like this...
Well, I guess...

Some hearts...
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side
Some hearts...
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes (sometimes)
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes...

Ooh
Even hearts like mine
Get lucky, lucky sometimes
Even hearts like mine
Ohhh

Some hearts...
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side
Yeah, some hearts...
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes
Some hearts...
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side
Yeah, some hearts...
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes (sometimes)
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes...
Oooh (sometimes)
