There to live
There for me
Reveal yourself be at ease
I'll be your fireblue burn for you everywhere
When blue turn to red
Then I will put it to rest
Maybe we will not be here

I'm gonna stay with you until I fall apart
I'll be your fireblue
Take me to the place I love

There is red an blue
Fire on the moon
Colors of snow come in June
Paint me a picture and I'll save it till then
When blue turn to red and I will never know
Maybe we will not be here

I'm gonna stay with you until I fall apart
I'll be your fireblue
Take me to the place I love
If you wanna stay with me
Take me to the place I love
Show me your fireblue
Don't ever let me fall apart

Apart

Apart

I'm gonna stay with you until I fall apart
I'll be your fireblue

Maybe we will not be here
I'm gonna stay with you until I fall apart
I'll be your fireblue
Don't ever let me fall apart
