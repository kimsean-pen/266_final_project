When I lose all my energy
Then I cry but I feel so free now
However far away
I will be wild like a child
As the time can fly
Whatever words they say I won't care
Inside my mind it's like a wind
When I lose all my energy
Then I cry but I feel so free now

Don't be shy of what you feel
Cause it's the result of what you give
When I lose all my energy
Then I cry but I feel so free now
However far away
I will be wild like a child
As the time can fly

When I lose all my energy
Then I cry but I feel so free now
However far away
I will be wild like a child
As the time can fly
Whatever words they say I won't care
Inside my mind it's like a wind
Don't be shy of what you feel
Cause it's the result of what you give

When I lose all my energy
Then I cry but I feel so free now
However far away
I will be wild like a child
As the time can fly
