I'll face my fear of the evening once I get used to this feeling
I can't sleep
That's when you're torn away from me
While I'm dreaming I feel you leaving

I'll face my fear of the sunrise when I wake up with your hand inside mine
It's hard to say "good morning" when it's followed with "goodbye"
Just wanted to say "good night"

Our eyes fighting the light
But I'm not ready to say "good night"
I try and hold on tight but it's just not time to say "good night"
Say good night

I'll face my fear of the cold nights when you leave me behind
I felt your hands in my hair
I felt your breath on my neck
Yeah, I need to feel you again

Just wanted to say "good night."

Our eyes fighting the light
But I'm not ready to say "good night"
I try and hold on tight but it's just not time to say "good night"
Say good night

These eyes are closed again for yet another night
I wake up and I can feel you by my side
But I can't find you in the dark when you're so far
Yeah that's the hardest part
Here comes the hardest part

Our eyes fighting the light
But I'm not ready to say "good night"
I try and hold on tight but it's just not time to say "good night"
Say good night

"I mean
In what world do I go to sleep
After you and wake up before you?!
I don't even know how it happens
Well I hope you're having sweet dreams
And you call me when you wake up."
