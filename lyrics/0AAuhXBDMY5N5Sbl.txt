This street has closed
For a ride undone
This street has closed
It could be unknown

In the dark, my friend
We'll meet to blend
A truth to lend
For a day to spend
A lovely scent
That once been smelled
That has no end

It's gaping up, midst through us
It's gaping up, midst through us

It's hard to find it
When you're in it
It's hard to find it
When you're into it
The sun, replace it
No safe, nor sound
On a frozen ground

No love can be safe with me
No love can be safe with me
No love can be safe with me
No love can be safe with me
