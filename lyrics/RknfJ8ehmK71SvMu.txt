Yes my baby left me
Never said a word
Was it something I've done?
Something that she heard?

My baby left me
My baby left me
My baby even left me
Never said a word

Now I stand at my window
Wring my hands and cry
I hate to lose that woman
Hate to say goodbye

You know she left me
Yes, she left me
My baby even left me
Never said a word

"Well, Blues's going"

Baby, one of these mornings
Lord, it won't be long
You'll look for me
Baby, and daddy he'll be gone

You know you left me
You know you left me
My baby even left me
Never said a goodbye

Now, I stand at my window
Wring my hands and moan
All I know is that
The one I love is gone

My baby left me
You know she left me
My baby even left me
Never said a word

Guess my baby left me
Never said a word
