I can't believe that it's real
The way that you make me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide

Our love is you and me, baby
That, ah, that makes the world go round
And if you've been doin' lovin' with me
Layin' all my troubles down

Ah, here I am, baby
Come and take me
Here I am, baby
Baby, come and take me
Take me by the hand, yeah
Oh, show me
Here I am, baby

It always ends up this way, yeah
Me begging you every day
For love that I cannot have
You broke my heart into half

Our love is you and me, baby
That, ah, that makes the world go round
And if you've been doin' lovin' with me
Layin' all my troubles down

Ah-ha, here I am, baby
Come and take me
Here I am, baby
Baby, come and take me
Take me by the hand, yeah
Ah, teach me
Here I am, baby

When I'm down
I can always call you
For a helpin' hand
I know you'll do the best you can
But it don't take much from me
For my cup of joe, ha-ha-ha-ha
Oh, there's love inside me
I believe there's going to be an explosion, yeah, yoo-hoo
It's tough for me, oh, baby
I can do worry, yeah
Tell me all your troubles, yeah
And you won't ever have to worry, no
One more thing you can do, just ask, ask everybody
Everybody you see, no, no, no
You'll find yourself
Lost and alone on a darkened street, ah, oh

Here I am, baby
Come and take me
Here I am, baby
Won't you come and take me?
Take me by the hand
Ah, show me
Yeah, teach me
Yeah, show me, won't you?
Here I am, baby
Yeah, take me, won't you?
Teach me
Baby, won't you take me by the hand?
