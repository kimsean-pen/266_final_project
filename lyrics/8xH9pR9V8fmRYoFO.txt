Go!

You're fucking crazy if you think that I'll ever change
I am I, I am me, I'll never change my ways
I'm a monster and that's how I'll stay
Condemned to predetermined damnation for eternity
Damnation for eternity

I don't want you to cry, I don't even want you to care
Don't you dare pray for me, no
These things I bury inside to keep away from the light
Don't you dare pray for me

(Who here will support us in putting my best friend
through rehab and making him better, put your hands up)

I've been so far gone for so long and
I can't keep my head up out the bottle
Holy fuck, why do I bother? I'm never gonna get any better
I've waited so long to declare "I don't give a fuck if I die today"

Holy shit, I've lost my mind, reality is starting to unwind

Don't pray for me
I don't want you to cry, I don't even want you to care
Don't you dare pray for me, no
These things I bury inside to keep away from the light
Don't you dare pray for me
I don't want you to cry, I don't even want you to care
Don't you dare pray for me, no
These things I bury inside to keep away from the light
Don't you dare pray for me
Don't you dare
