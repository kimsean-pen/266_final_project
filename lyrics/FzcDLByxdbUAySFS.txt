You're a white collar boy and you gave into the law
Give in to the pressure, the cops gonna getcha
You were a thieving dog at work until they caught your little paw
Your wage won't stretch to picking up checks

A custodial sentence she narrowly avoided
Community service you had to go along with
You're banging the rocks at the old city docks
Poor boy, poor boy, poor boy, poor boy
Boy, poor boy, poor boy, poor boy

You were chained to a girl that would kill you with a look
It's a nice way to die, she's so easy on the eye
She said, "Let's get away" but you played it by the book
You're a warden's pet, she's a screaming suffragette

We ain't in prison, we'll just finish up and go home
She said "Not for me, I've got plans for later on"
So she belted the sarge, she jumped on a barge
And you fell, you fell, you fell, you fell
Fell, you fell, you fell, you fell

White collar got dirt in your pants
You got egg in your hair, you got spit on your chin, you're a-
White collar scared to be bored
Blue Collar, she's opening doors
White collar boy on the run from the law

She said "You ain't ugly, you can kiss me if you like"
Go ahead and kiss her, you don't know what you're missing
Now baby you're special but there's something not quite right
She's a Venus in flares and you wanna split hairs

Oh, I am innocent, you were the rocket
Things were okay till you took out the copper
Now leave me alone, get used to the chains
You're a pain, you're a pain, you're a pain, you're a pain
Pain, you're a pain, you're a pain, you're a pain

White collar got dirt in your pants
You got egg in your hair, you've got spit on your chin, you're a-
White collar got dirt in your pants
You got egg in your hair, you've got spit on your chin, you're a-

White collar, scared to be bored
Blue Collar, she's opening doors
White collar boy on the run from the law
The law, the law, the law

Get on your bike, get on your horse
