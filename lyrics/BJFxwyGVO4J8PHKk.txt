do you live in that big bright sky
do you live in that big bright sky
where the sun don't grow so hot in the summer time
the moon watched chase to hanes and all else it finds
we don't need you to do what we do
we don't need you to do what we do
so we chased our tails around
heads were all we found
and in those heads a shining place
a town inside this home
we don't need you to do what we do
we don't need you to do what we do
little lips hammers for fists
eyes were little lights
building base from town to town
based in another town
we don't need you to do what we do
we don't need you to do what we do
we don't need you to do what we do
we don't need you to do what we do
mark the trails from point to point
tape bright enough to find
the moons the only one watching
you never gotta hide
we don't need you
when the boys go missing down by the riverbed
the grass don't grow too tall in the summer
the fireweed bloom marks the end of the summer time
while the willow down spills coming in with the summer
we don't need you to do what we do
we don't need you to do what we do
do you live in that big bright sky
do you live in that big bright sky
