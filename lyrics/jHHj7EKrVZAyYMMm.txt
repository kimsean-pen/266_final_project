Falling fast
Raise your glass
Fill your open sores

While you last
Wear your mask
Wear it like it's real

Like home
These are my pearls
Like home
And i wear 'em

Hurry world
Whirl and whirl
Stop when you fall down
Like you did

Raise your head
Wish that you were there

Like home
These are my pearls
Like home
And i wear 'em

While you last
Raise your mask
Look at you reflect

Hate will grow
Into blossoms of no
Take you lower than low

Hate will grow with your alcohol glow
You'll get used to the show

Hate will grow
Into someone you know

It feels good to be home
