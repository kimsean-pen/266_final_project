daddy knows just what to do when his hand becomes a pool
in his head he aint a fool
pushing weight in hollywood
my gestalt is hanging on the edge of the fault, learning tricks from uncle donnie and walt for our education
sloganeering on the lot, he's a nascent vagabond, motion picture babylon
when im twisted and alone
my gestalt is hanging on the edge of the fault learning trucks from uncle donnie and walt for a revelation.
and if u thought this paradigm was out of the box, this rare design is only a block in the tesselation
