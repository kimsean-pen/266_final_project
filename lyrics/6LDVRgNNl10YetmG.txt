A little sleep, a little slumber
A little folding of the hands
Left you weak, left you hungry
When there's supply you still demand

You're beginning to drag the ones you love down
Will this phase ever end?
A thousand arms to hold you
But you won't reach for any hands

'Cause I don't feel like I'm getting through to you
Let me paint this clear, life is short, my dear
See your mother here, her last painful year
I wish you only knew...
She stuck around for you
She stuck around for you

Maybe you should just fall
Leave the world and lose it all
And if that's what you need
To finally see
I'll be with you through it all

Bring on the pills, roll that dollar bill
Medicating will never heal
Relapse, rehab, repeat
Always thinking about the me, me, me

Self-destruct, spiral down
Until your want becomes your need
Please get up like I know you can
Or forever love the fall

'Cause I don't feel like I'm getting through to you
Let me paint this clear, life is short, my dear
See your mother here, her last painful year
I wish you only knew...
She stuck around for you
She stuck around for you

Maybe you should just fall
Leave the world and lose it all
And if that's what you need
To finally see
I'll be with you through it all
I'll be with you through it all

I can't stand to see you down
Strung out, off the wagon, and unwound
Steady... steady... Oh God, Jenny
I can't bear to hear the sound
Of your body hitting the ground

I can't stand to see you down
Strung out, off the wagon, and unwound
Steady... steady... Oh God, Jenny
I can't bear to hear the sound
Of your body hitting the ground

Oh Jenny Jenny Jenny

Stuck around for you
He stuck around for you
Stuck around for you

Maybe you should just fall
Leave the world and lose it all
And if that's what you need
To finally see
She loved you through it all

Maybe you should just fall
And if that's what you need
To finally see
She loved you through it all

I'll be with you through it all!
