I can see you in the stars tonight
Lost in love and light
Hear this call:
As they witness the immortal rise
Lost as love arrives
Hear this call.

Anticipation of the morning comes again
We fear all through the night till the morning comes,
Then we fear the light

But stay the course
You've stayed through worse
Or just stay because you said you would

Anticipation of the evil inside that never arrived
And ill feed it again,
The fire burning inside

I can see you in the stars tonight
Lost in love and light
Hear this call:
As they witness the immortal rise
Lost as love arrives
Hear this call.

Warrior, warrior
Ways began the way, the ways began the way
Warrior, warrior

I can see you in the stars tonight
Lost in love and light
Hear this calling
As they witness the immortal rise
Lost as love arrives
Hear this call
