Sitting in an S.D.T.
Waiting for an underground train
To rumble underneath my feet

Bang goes another day
Where it went I could not say
Now I'll have to wait another week

When all is said and all is done
What was said was never done
The panic is not really worth your while

Bang goes another year
In and out of one ear
Everybody's doing it so do it too

I don't need anyone
But a little love could make things better
I don't need anyone
But a little love could make things better

Sitting on the early bus
Passing through the morning rush
It makes no difference that I'm not with you

Bang goes another year
In and out of one ear
Everybody's doing it, I'll do it too

I don't need anyone
But a little love could make things better
I don't need anyone
But a little love could make things better

Aah, aah

I don't need anyone
But a little love could make things better
I don't need anyone
But a little love could make things better

I don't need anyone
But a little love could make things better
I don't need anyone
But a little of your love could make things better
