Oh, you called me that night
I was standing outside
You couldn't leave it behind
How could I change your mind?
Oh, the start of July
When I realized
But you couldn't decide
Oh, you'll find out in time

An echo in my mind, images of you and I
(Mm-mm), but you can't be mine
Summer night, everything hurts
Make a move, pull me closer (mm-mm)
Drive me home with the windows down
Drive me home with the windows down
Drive me home with the windows down

It's such a shame, such a shame
You're second guessing, baby, saying you don't even know me
I've learned my lesson, say I learned to be had
But you know I'm only kidding myself, honey
What would it take (what would it take, what would it take)
To think about me any other way?
My hands are shaking (my hands are shaking)
I just keep driving 'til I found myself on your horizon

An echo in my mind, images of you and I
(Mm-mm), but you can't be mine
Summer night, everything hurts
Make a move, pull me closer (mm-mm)
Drive me home with the windows down
Drive me home with the windows down
Drive me home with the windows down

What would it take to think about me any other way?
My hands are shaking
I'll just keep driving 'til I find myself on your horizon

An echo in my mind, images of you and I
(Mm-mm), but you can't be mine
Summer night, everything hurts
Make a move, pull me closer (mm-mm)
Drive me home with the windows down
Drive me home with the windows down
Drive me home with the windows down
