Funny now it's all loud
See what only nakedness could hide
Something's got you tongue tied
Like you're barely handling the ride
Sentimental storm clouds
Gathering, let's try to play them down
They've been there the whole time
Following from grip
To call, to walk, to run, too slow

Live and die for it
Simulate in blood baths
In bed, all red, we're wed
And unembarrassed to dare this affair with
No brutalized romance or criticize slow dance
Your head's your head
But still we're not afraid to share this with careful awareness

In the middle of the night, when fear comes calling
Singin' it all dies, awfully scared, alone
I'm looking into your eyes to feel your call
Pretty thing that catches me so strong when I fall

Another shining morning
[?] got you by the lungs
Wanna see some mourning
But it seems a [?] never done
Drop conflict to floor and
Suddenly the whole thing weighs a ton
Same body that you're dancing
Bring you back to me, lick, and roll, and raise your inner sun

Live and die for it
Swearing by black maths
In bed, we're fed, we're wed
And unembarrassed to share this affair with
No brutalized romance or criticize slow dance
My head's my head, but still we're not afraid
To save for ourselves what a pair is

In the middle of the light, just wanna be your darling
Running by your side, let me play along
Look into your eyes, see the love we're born in
Hear your heart so sweetly, just wanna sing its song

Everything's alright, just let me be your darling
Running by your side, nevermore alone
Look into your eyes and see the love we're born in
Hear your heart so sweetly, just wanna sing its song
