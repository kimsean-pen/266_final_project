Friday night and the scene is bright at Avalon
Walked straight to the bar in her party dress
Told the bartender pour her a shot and make it strong

Because she needed
Cheering up
She proceeded
To get drunk

You could see it
Tearing up
In her eyes
But when she gets home
She puts her headphones on
She plays her favorite song
And fades away
And when the music's on

She can do no wrong
And she feels safe and calm
And it's ok
And she says

Ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
Ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
The world keeps turning, life goes on
Yeah she says
Ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
Ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
The world keeps turning, life goes on

You got to shake it off
Shake it.
Night before had a date with a boy from Highland Park
Said he'd meet her at the diner at 9 o'clock

Leather boots, eyeliner laid on extra dark
She got a table
Set for two
But he never

Made it through
And she tried to
Play it cool
As she cried

But when she gets home
She puts her headphones on
She plays her favorite song
And fades away

And when the music's on
She can do no wrong
And she feels safe and calm
And it's ok

And she says
Ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
Ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
The world keeps turning, life goes on
Yeah she says
Ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
Ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
The world keeps turning, life goes on
You got to shake it off
Shake it.
