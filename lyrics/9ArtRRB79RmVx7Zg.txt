So what's your purpose for me
With your intentions in the air
So what if I wanted to
Ask you
If I could meet you there

Go inside I'm coming through
For you
I could not be more... gone

We watched each other escape
From the commotion that we knew
The way our languages fade
In through an empty living room

Go inside I'm coming through
Into our world that you surround

Show me now
I'm here with you
For you
I could not be more... gone

Go inside I'm coming through
Into our world that you surrounded

Show me now
I'm here with you
For you
(2x)

I could not be more... gone
