Today could be a different day
If the sky lifts up the haze
Off of my front lawn
Or just another time I hold my tears
For another year
On my way back home

Can I sell this sunrise?
In return for a sunet... yah...
Can I just be here one more day
Until my sunburn fades away

I've asked 100 times whats going on
But it went in one ear and out the other one
Oh can I take a palm tree home with me?
For the memory of here when I'm at home
And i've been looking forward, not back
Vacation's everything we need

Can I sell this sunrise?
In return for a sunset... yah...
Can I just be here one more day
Until my sunburn fades away

Im taking pictures of everything
To remind me of a place thats so perfect for me
Im taking pictures of everything
So go ahead and take this place away from me

Today could be another day
When the sky lifts up the haze
Off of my front lawn
Just another time I hold my tears
For another year
On my way back home

Can I sell this sunrise?
In return for a sunset... yah...
Can I just be here one more day
Until my sunburn fades away

(repete x2)
Until my sunburn fades away
