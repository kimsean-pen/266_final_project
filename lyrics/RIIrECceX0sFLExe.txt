First off, give a girl some credit
I'ma keep on loving you
'Cause you be the realest
All day and all night
That's how you stay by my side

I don't always do the right thing
It doesn't matter, 'cause nobody's perfect here, no
If you leave, I can't make you stay

Where you going, where you tryna go?
Where you going, where you tryna go?
Baby, baby?

Where you going, where you tryna go?
Where you going, where you tryna go?
Baby, baby?

Sit yourself down, 'cause you know you're gonna stay
Boy, you better listen to the words I say
You ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

Boy, you better act like you got some sense
'Cause you got a dime, and that's money well spent
You ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

We'll be here all day
If you start pointing fingers my way
I just wished you love me, love me, baby
If you can do that, then I'll do the same, yeah

We can make it work, baby
We'd be crazy if we don't try
Love and hate is such a thin line

Where you going, where you tryna go?
Where you going, where you tryna go?
Baby, baby?

Where you going, where you tryna go?
Where you going, where you tryna go?
Baby, baby?

Sit yourself down, 'cause you know you're gonna stay
Boy, you better listen to the words I say
You ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

Boy, you better act like you got some sense
'Cause you got a dime, and that's money well spent
You ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

If you're waiting for me
You gon' be waiting all night
If you're gonna play games, you're gonna lose
You'll be sorry if you say goodbye

Yeah, I still want you, but I don't need you
You should be happy I'm still here for you
Don't have to be, you must be blind if you can't see

Where you going, where you tryna go?
Where you going, where you tryna go?
Baby, baby?

Where you going, where you tryna go?
Where you going, where you tryna go?
Baby, baby?

Sit yourself down, 'cause you know you're gonna stay
Boy, you better listen to the words I say
You ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

Boy, you better act like you got some sense
'Cause you got a dime, and that's money well spent
You ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

Sit yourself down, 'cause you know you're gonna stay
Boy, you better listen to the words I say
You ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

Boy, you better act like you got some sense
'Cause you got a dime, and that's money well spent
You ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere
