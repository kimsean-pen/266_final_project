I know you think I'm a psychopath
A Democrat lurking in the dark
I think you know what I need to get by

I know you think I'm a sociopath
"My lovely prey," I'm a cliche
Make way I'm in my Pepsi mood
Mama needs food, how about a barbecue?
Remember when we?
I don't know what you need to get by
Something for your mind (mind), mind (mind), mind (mind)
Something for your mind (mind), mind, mind (mind)
(무엇인가 정신에 집어넣으세요)
Something for your mind (mind, mind, mind)
(마음에 어떤 것 필요합니까?)
Something for your mind (mind, mind)
(정신에 집어넣으세요)
Something for your, for your
M-I, M-I, M-I-N-D
M-I, M-I, M-I-N-D
