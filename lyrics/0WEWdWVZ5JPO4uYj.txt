Hold on we pushing through now
Don't let it get to you wow, don't get proud
Don't let your ego get loud
We trying to keep our feet on the ground
We gottawork this out

Hold on cause I'm slipping
Catch me if I fall cause your tripping
Don't you get ahead of yourself
In the past you given me hell, I'll brace myself

I still wonder if you love me the right way
I still wonder if you understand
What you've done, you've done, you've done Love
You've done, you've done love
You've done, you've done love
Love

What was said and done, wasn't good
We had some fun, did what we could
But baby you strayed, I stayed, I stayed here
Wonder if things would change
Stay around stay the same
I still, I still love, Love

Hold on cause I'm slipping
Catch me if I fall cause your tripping
Don't you get ahead of yourself
In the past you given me hell, I'll brace myself

I still wonder if you love me the right way
I still wonder if you understand
What you've done, you've done, you've done Love
You've done, you've done love
You've done, you've done love
Love

Stayed around, I stayed around
Held you down, I held you down
But you don't get it, No
Maybe I should go
Stayed around, I stayed around
Tell me now, just tell me now
I can't take no more
What do I do this for

I still wonder if you love me the right way
I still wonder if you understand
What you've done, you've done, you've done Love
You've done, you've done love
You've done, you've done love
Love

I still wonder if you love me the right way
I still wonder if you understand
What you've done, you've done, you've done Love
You've done, you've done love
You've done, you've done love
Love
