I wanna lie but I believe in karma
I wanna hide and listen to Madonna
I wanna cry but I don't think I'm gonna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna run but don't know where to run to
I wanna dance but don't know what to dance to
I am in love but don't know if it's with you, with you

Am I drunk? Am I dumb?
Am I high? Am I numb?
Cause they never told us, no they never told us

How much it hurts to be young
No one told us it would be this way
How much it hurts to be young
No one told us it would be this way
How much it hurts to be young

I wanna shout so everyone can hear me
I wanna scream, I want all of you to fear me
I wanna kiss but you never come near me, come near me

Am I drunk? Am I dumb?
Am I high? Am I numb?
Cause they never told us, no they never told us

How much it hurts to be young
No one told us it would be this way
How much it hurts to be young
No one told us it would be this way
How much it hurts to be young

Cause they never told us, no they never told us
Cause they never told us, no they never told us
How much it hurts to be young
No one told us it would be this way
No one told us it would be this way

How much it hurts to be young
Most days I think I could go insane
How much it hurts to be young
No one told us it would be this way
How much it hurts to be young
How much it hurts to be young
