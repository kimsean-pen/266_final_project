Sometimes at night when I turn off the lights
I be thinking about you
Baby, baby, baby, yeah
Tossing in my bed all these thoughts in my head
Got me losing my breath now
Baby, baby, baby, yeah
Tell me what would you do
If you only knew
How I feel about you
About you
I wanna your be first, your last, your everything
I wanna be in your arms and definitely

I wanna be someone you keep coming back to see

I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Wanna be your baby
Deep down inside there's an unending fire
And I just can't contain it
Baby, baby, baby, yeah
You're the only one who can
Show me that you feel the same
I wanna hear you say my name
Baby, baby, baby, yeah
Tell me what would you do
If you only knew
How I feel about you
About you
I wanna your be first, your last, your everything
I wanna be in your arms and definitely
I wanna be someone you keep coming back to see

I wanna be one
I wanna be who
Wanna be your baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I wanna your be first, your last, your everything
I wanna be in your arms and definitely

I wanna be someone you keep coming back to see

I wanna be one
I wanna be who
I wanna be your baby
I wanna be your baby
Baby, baby, baby

Oh yeah
Baby, baby
Oh yeah
