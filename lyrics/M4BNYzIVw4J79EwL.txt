Behind somber eyes of muted silver
I cultivate my pain
For they are shields
And my tongue a weapon
Cut deep and lick the pain
A sharpened edge through soft skin
A human shell of venom
I shine this golden light upon you
Let you call it life
Beautifully crated words mean nothing
They carry no weight
For pithing my heart you'll find no purchase
I'll leave you just as dead as me
Golden, empty, full of venom
