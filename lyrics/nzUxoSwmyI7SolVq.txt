Once, I lived the life of a millionaire
Spent all my money, I just did not care
Taking all my friend out for a good time
We bought bootleg whiskey, champagne and wine

Then I began to fall so low
I lost all my good friends, I did not have nowhere to go
Never get my hand on a dollar again
I'm gonna hang on to it until the eagle grins

'Cause no, no, no, nobody knows you
When you're down and out
In your pocket [Incomprehensible], not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

When you finally get back upon your feet again
Here comes everybody sayin' they wanna be
A good old long-lost friend, [Incomprehensible] mighty strange
Nobody knows you when you're down and out

I said, when you finally get back on your feet
Everybody wants to be a good old long-lost friend
You know it's mighty strange, yeah, down and out
Nobody knows you, nobody knows you
Nobody, nobody knows you when you're down and out
