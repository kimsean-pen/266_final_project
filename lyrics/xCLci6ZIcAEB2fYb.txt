I know it's my fault
I gave up on everything
and I see you happy
It warms my heart
My heart

We said
It's not the end
but she wore that white dress
And I changed
We are not the same
But I thought you'd wait
I thought you'd wait
You would wait

And we sit
On my cold
Apartment floor
Where we thought we would stay in love.
Stay in love
