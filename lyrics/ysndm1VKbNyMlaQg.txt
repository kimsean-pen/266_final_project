Terrorized by threat of size, the cog in the machine,
He settles for the crooked line.
Their pandering to the "small" points: abortion, guns and creed.
Our polar voices buy headlines.

The common must unite.

We'll force the giant's hand,
Cripple its demand.
David and Goliath
Sates an appetite.
Let the fuel run dry
They need to do survive

Citizens too sensitive to face the urgency,
They settle for fight, flight or freeze.
Senses, weary, hope to speak his children have to eat
The smallest musters to defeat.

Paralyzed by need

Or force the giant's hand,
Cripples its demand.
David and Goliath
Sates an appetite.
Let the fuel run dry
They need to do survive

Wide eyed
Infected DNA
Injected into self
Holding its holster
Of the only strife for wealth

He thought he had to save the world.
He only had to stop destroying it.
He only had to stop waiving his rights,
Supporting the stream of trickle down lies.
The cog in the machine - the fundamental gene
They need it to survive!

Wide eyed
Infected DNA
Injected into self
Holding its holster
Of the only strife for wealth

Pigs

We only strive for wealth
We only strive for wealth
The cog in the machine
