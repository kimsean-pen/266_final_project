Everyday is numb
Oh, I hold my tongue
Nothing's gonna bring me hope, no
I'm hanging on
Tunnel with the lights turned off
Oh, I know you're near
Drawing me like a moth, no

I'm closer to your flame
It's harder to explain
It's easier to sleep
Than to face it awake

Open up my eyes and show me salvation
Wake this body up 'cause I'm tired of sleepin'
Oh, and there's no heartbeat, something's wrong with me
Help, please, I can barely breathe
Wake me, give me a reason, reason

Inside these walls
Oh, I'm safe and sound
You will never see me fall, no
Or hit the ground
Maybe this is just a cry for help
Maybe I should just forget myself
Is this the reason that I go through hell?
Is this the reason that I dream it all away

Withdrawal and medicate
It's easier to sleep
Than to face it awake

Open up my eyes and show me salvation
Wake this body up 'cause I'm tired of sleepin'
Oh, and there's no heartbeat, something's wrong with me
Help, please, I can barely breathe
Wake me, give me a reason, reason

I know when the lights go out
No one will find me
Behind the darkest cloud
I run for safety

I know if I let you in
I might be free again
I wish that I could be like you

Open up my eyes and show me salvation
Wake this body up 'cause I'm tired of sleepin'
Oh, and there's no heartbeat, something's wrong with me
Help, please, I can barely breathe
Wake me, give me a reason, reason

Wake me, give me a reason, reason
Wake me, give me a reason
