When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children in any way they could
(Oof!)

By pouring their derision upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
(Ahahahahahahaha!!!!)

But in the town, it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and psychopathic wives
Would thrash them within inches of their lives

Ooooooh, oooooh, ooooh, ooooooh
Ooooooh, oooooh, oooooooh
