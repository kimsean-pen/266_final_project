Tired out, not a miracle in days (oh, yeah)
Deciders for the lonely whispering tears
You try out for nothing then you drop dead
Not a miracle in years
Oh, leisure for the lonely
Whispering unecessary unless you're in

Die and succeed
I say it out loud, but you just don't care
Farewell, well, well, well, well, well, well, till you know me well
Farewell, well, well, well, well, well, well, till you know me well
Girlfriend

We are far from home, I am with you now
I'm longing you, I'm longing us two
Who bought a miracle sells these fortune tears
December's death or glory, how do you want it?
No, not a miracle in years
Deciders for the lonely
Wishing death wishes death unless

Die and succeed
I say it out loud, but you just don't care
Farewell, well, well, well, well, well, well, till you know me well
Farewell, well, well, well, well, well, well, till you know me well
Girlfriend

Die and succeed
I say it out loud but you just don't care
And well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well
