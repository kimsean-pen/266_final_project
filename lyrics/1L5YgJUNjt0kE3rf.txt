There she stands on the flor
Colder than ice
Vision fixed on the door
Colder than ice
Now she knows that she's nice
Golden hair and deep blue eyes
Noone dances her twice
Nothing happen so far
'cause who wants to
get burned by the ice
No one reach her tonigth
Before she takes flight
She's colder than ice
How can i get in first
Hurt to intice

She's colder than ice
Colder than ice
Colder than ice
Suddenly i was there
And she's is in his arms
All to close to him
And she feels his charms
Couldn't see it no more
Could it be i'm loosing for use
Oh it's breaking me up
'cause i'm the only one
Who dares to walk on the ice
No more reach her tonight
Before she takes flight
She's colder than ice
How can i get in first
She's colder than ice
Colder than ice
Colder than ice
Colder than ice
No one reach her tonight
Before she takes flight
She's colder than ice
How can i get in first
Hurt to intice
She's colder than ice
Colder than ice
Colder than ice
