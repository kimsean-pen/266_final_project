Five thousand black winged angels descend,
Do you belive we are nearing the end,
Time to sing in th' dead of night,
Feathers pray as they drink their last flight.
Blackbirds fall from the sky,
Through our wings you ask why,
Why I lie to believe
But I'm not that naive
Shattered dreams have turned her sour,
We want nothing and we want no power
Wasting time tryig to find the truth
We'll only win when we've nothing to lose
Blackbirds fall from the sky
Through our wings you ask why
Doesn't fill me with sorrow
If this means no tomorrow
I'm bright far from the tree,
Shake her love by the beat
In you body right through the tree
And then you'll catch your relief
I'm bright far from the tree
Shake her love by the beat
In your body right through the tree
And then you'll catch your relief.
