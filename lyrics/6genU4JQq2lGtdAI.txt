The light just blinks, the drill drills on
It blinds my eyes until the light is gone

Just another day in the dark
Just another day my hopeless heart is bleeding out
When will time run out?

I know that pain may be simply temporary
But when will the daylight come for me?

Just another day in the dark
Just another day my beating heart falls from my mouth
When will time run out?

We spend our lives trying to chase the sun, but every day it sets
And we're plunged into darkness once again
Misery has a duality
Misery has a duality in me
Just one last question before I leave
Is this terminal, or will I heal?

I know that pain may be simply temporary
But when will the daylight come for me?

Of all the things in life that are not mine, I solely crave a well-mind
I've spent yet another summer night questioning if joy is a birth-right
Through all the hardships and the darker times, you try your best just to survive
And when I close my eyes on life in time, I'll see the last of the evening light
The last of the evening light
