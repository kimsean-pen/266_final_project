We opened up our eyes girl
To see that everythings alright
My vocal chords are healing
From arguing with you all night
Wait a minute cause girl
I mean it when i say
I got to have you
Oh yes indeed
Because it's my way
Or pacific coast highway
Either way you wont find me
And you don't care
Because it's my way
Or pacific coast highway
Hit road you wont find me
Thats all you know
The shell remains been broken
Every word has been said
Ready to give you the reigns and control
But not my head
Wait a minute, wait a minute cause girl
I mean it when i say
I got to have you
And oh, you're gonna have to change
If you're gonna stay
Oh yes indeed
Because it's my way
Or pacific coast highway
Either way you wont find me
And you don't care
Because it's my way
Or pacific coast highway
Hit road you wont find me
Thats all you know
I thought you might like to know
I've been doin just fine
Walkin on my own lately, yeah
The sun has been shining down on me
Telling me to walk away,
Walk away, walk away
If it were that easy
I would be
Far away...
Because it's my way
Or pacific coast highway
Either way you wont find me
And you don't care
I tried to show you
But you never gave reasons
Your attitudes like the seasons
Thats all you know
Because it's my way
Or pacific coast highway
Either way you wont find me
And you don't care
I tried to show you
But you never gave reasons
Your attitudes like the seasons
Thats all you know
