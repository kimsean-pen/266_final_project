If I should write a book for you
That brought me fame and fortune too,
That book would be,
Like my heart and me,
Dedicated to you.

And if I should paint a picture too
That showed the loveliness of you,
My art would be,
Like my heart and me,
Dedicated to you.

To you,
Because your love is the beacon that lights up my way.
To you,
Because with you I know a lifetime could be just one heavenly day.

If I should find a twinkling star,
One half as wondrous as you are,
That star would be
Like my heart and me,
Dedicated to you.

To you,
Because your love is the beacon that lights up my way.
To you,
Because with you I know a lifetime could be just one heavenly day.

If I should find a twinkling star,
One half as wondrous as you are,
That star would be
Like my heart and me,
Dedicated to you.
