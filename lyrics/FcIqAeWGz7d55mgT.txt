I heard that you were home again,
but you don't look like you're back to me
with your focuses changing,
your gaze is transfixed
a point that i can't often see

you've got your new ties,
I've got my old knots,
you've got your inside lines
but you're never happy with what you've got

careful now
you're so beautiful
when you've convinced yourself
that no one else is quite as beautiful

I heard that you were living well,
but you don't look like you're living to me
though the sparkle is gone,
your smile is in place
so that everyone watching can see
you've got them all convinced

but I know it so well
that you could list your friends
but you can't count on them

hold it now
you've got everyone convinced
that you're alright
when no one else is quite as vulnerable

as soon as you got it you want something else
it's not the sale that you love it's the sell
it's not the price that going to cost you
it's just the weight that's going to bring you
down, down, down, down

it's going to bring you
down, down, down, down, down

repeat 2x

hold it now
you've got everyone convinced
that you're alright
noone else is quite as vulnerable

careful now
you're so beautiful
when you've convinced yourself
noone else is quite as beautiful (you're so beautiful)

as soon as you got it you want something else
it's not the sale that you love it's the sell
it's not the price that going to cost you
it's just the weight that's going to bring you
down, down, down, down

it's going to bring you
down, down, down, down, down(you're so beautiful)

as soon as you got it you want something else
it's not the sale that you love it's the sell
it's not the price that going to cost you
it's just the weight that's going to bring you,
down...
