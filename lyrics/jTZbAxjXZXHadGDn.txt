Do you want to get away from here?
And when?
Well I'll be damned
It's the time of the year, again

You don't respect yourself
You ain't gon' leave the house tonight
You gonna stand your ground
You gon' remind yourself why

If you thought that I'd forget
I haven't just yet
Thought that I'd forget
But it's hard to forget
If you thought that I'd forget
I haven't just yet

Thought that I'd forget
(Now you're moving on)
But it's hard to forget

I still wanna get away from here
Feeling so paper thin 'bout to cave in
Like you don't have to ask me twice
You always say you're done
You ain't gon' leave the house tonight
You're gonna stand your ground
You gon' remind yourself why

If you thought that I'd forget
But it's hard to forget
Thought that I'd forget
But it's hard to forget
Thought that I'd forget
But it's hard to forget

Thought that I'd forget
Thought that I'd forget
Thought that I'd forget
