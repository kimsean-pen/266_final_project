I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
Then take the clouds and have the sun proudly shining on you
Take the stars as well and line them up to spell "Darling, I love you"
And little by little watch it all come true

I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
Take the wind and have it blow all my kisses to you
Take the birds and teach them all the words of every love song I know
And then have them fly around and sing them all to you

Darling, you know, I'm sorry
I won't get to see you today
My mind is a mess and I'm needing you less
Give me your call in a little while

I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
'Cause every time I close my eyes I'm just dreaming of you
"Darling, I love you"
And little by little watch it all come true

Darling, you know, I'm sorry
I won't get to see this week
Lately I've found I don't need you around
Don't think it's working now anyway

I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
I wanna tell the whole world how I'm crazy about you
I love you every second, every minute, every hour of the day
And I'm sitting here and hope all come true

I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
'Cause you're the only girl I ever met who's honest and true
I'd like to and mess around with you
And I'm sitting here and hope all come true

I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
Then take the clouds and have the sun proudly shining on you
Take the stars as well and line them up to spell "Darling, I love you"
And little by little watch it all come true
Darling, you know, I'm sorry
I won't get to see you again
My mind is a mess and I changed my address
So baby, please, don't call
