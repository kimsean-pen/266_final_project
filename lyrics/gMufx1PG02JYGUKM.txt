One awkward fish
Who remembers that one awkward fish?
One awkward fish
Who remembers that one awkward fish?
It played for all
And after football
It would dance on snow
When tire settled in
It could do anything, that's when

(One Turkish boy)
(I do remember that one Turkish boy)
(One Turkish boy)
(I do remember that one Turkish boy)

I remember, whilst we fed Christ
His were weddings every fortnight
Now I wonder if he is broken free
And oh what rebels we were
Can't remember his name
As keys keeps the weeps in Illinois
Hope his cheers are of nothing but joy

Oh, one Turkish boy from Camberwell
Hope you're doing very well
One Turkish boy from Camberwell
Hope you are doing very well

(One Turkish boy from Camberwell)
(Hope he is doing very well)
(One Turkish boy from Camberwell)
(Hope he is doing very well))
Turkish boy
Turkish boy
