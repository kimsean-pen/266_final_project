There was a call in the dark
Then I saw you
I was caught in the story
The first page down

I'll keep you safe from harm
Into my open arms
(Can we stay up? Can we stay up?)
Can we stay right here all night long?
(Can we stay up? Can we stay up?)

You pour a glass and it overflows
You turn the lights right down real low
Your look don't know where to go
Symmetrical
It's like we've been here before
It's like we know who we are
It's like the first touch again
Symmetrical
Time, there's always time
Remember to not let go
Symmetrical

You got a cocaine heart
You got bright eyes
You got a smoking tone
You got fast lips

I'll keep you safe from harm
Into these open arms
(Can we stay up? Can we stay up?)
Can we stay right here all night long?
(Can we stay up? Can we stay up?)

As we wait for the sunset to come
You just slip your heels back on
'Cause you can only move through the dark
Symmetrical
It's like we've been here before
It's like we know who we are
It's like the first touch again
Symmetrical
Time, there's always time
Remember to not let go
Symmetrical

I'll keep you safe from harm
In these open arms
(Can we stay up? Can we stay up?)
Can we stay right here all night long?
(Can we stay up? Can we stay up?)
I'll keep you safe from harm
In these open arms
(Can we stay up? Can we stay up?)
Can we stay right here all night long?
