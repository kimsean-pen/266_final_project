Look back in bitterness
going back to
broken pieces of past
staying in memories
hesitating stepping
forward to real

I'm a stupid wanderer
wandering poor fellow
given up to live
in the place
that we made before
Ohio gentle wave
on an ocean of recall

oh hi oh hi
I watch your pain
oh hi oh hi
the same as mine

Long story truly short
rewind it ever over again
its hard to find the rest
the world without you
never can stand

I'm a stupid blind old man
denying such a bright light
give up to go
live in the place
that we made before
Ohio gentle wave
on ocean of recall

oh hi oh hi
I watch your pain
oh hi oh hi
the same as mine

Take me from your breath
let me down to
back to real
I will erase you
set me free from you
I know it's hard to try

oh hi oh hi
I watch your pain
oh hi oh hi
the same as mine

oh hi oh hi
i watch your pain
oh hi oh hi
the same as mine
