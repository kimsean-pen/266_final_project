I don't mind,
'Cause this is something that I have to find,
'After all this time
I'll be okay,
'Cause when the skies turn black,
And the floor beneath you starts to crack,
You know I'm coming back, today,

I don't mind,
'Cause this is something that I have to find,
After all this time,
I'll be okay,

'Cause when the skies turn black,
And the floor beneath me starts to crack,
You know I'm coming back, today,

I know,
That it's too hard to find,
A little piece of mind,
In this crazy storm,

So we'll go,
Wherever we feel like,
'Cause I'm that kind of guy,
You've been warned,

Well as a last resort,
We're going to give it one more try,
We'll give it one more shot, and one more go,

And it'll be all for not,
If after all this time,
We've given all we've got and still don't know,

I don't mind,
'Cause this is something that I have to find,
After all this time,
I'll be okay,

'Cause when the skies turn black,
And the floor beneath me starts to crack,
You know I'm coming back, today,

End :)
