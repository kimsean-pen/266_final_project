You got to leave your seat
You gotta get up upon your feet
You're gonna move ya to the rhythm till you never can stop
We got the power, we got the music
And you bet that you can use it
We're gonna take rock-bottom, we're gonna take it to the top
Put yourself in our hands
So our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands
So our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Move a little nearer
You know you gotta follow your leaders
As we need you, like you need us for sure
We're gonna drive you
We're gonna ride you
We're gonna get right inside you
And if you wanna keep going
Just shout out for more!
Put yourself in our hands
So our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands
So our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Sing your song
We'll listen to you
Sing your song
The spotlights are you
Put yourself in our hands
So our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands
So our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands
So our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands
So our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world.
