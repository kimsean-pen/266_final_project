I've been runnin' with the gone right people
we'll be coming for you
I've been dying with the unclean people
I know that
what will she do now that she don't love you

That's the trick, that's the trick
I can't believe that you're falling for it
That's the fear, feel it grow
shatters the ground as it comes from below

Thousand miles to go
Now you've got to go
Thousand miles to go for you

Thousand miles to go
Now you've got to go
Thousand miles to go
What will she do now that she don't love you

That's the trick, that's the trick
I can't believe that you're falling for it
That's the fear, feel it grow
shatters the ground as it comes from below
That's the trick, that's the trick, that's the trick, that's the trick

That's the trick, that's the trick
I can't believe that you're falling for it
That's the fear, feel it grow
shatters the ground as it comes from below
That's the trick, that's the trick, that's the trick, that's the trick
