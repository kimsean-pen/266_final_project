Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him is like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Red

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him is like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
(Burning, it was red)
Burning red
(Burning, it was red)

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him is like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Loving him was red
Loving him was red

And that's why he's spinning
'Round through my head, burning red
Burning red
His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
