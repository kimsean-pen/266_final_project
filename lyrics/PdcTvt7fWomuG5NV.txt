There's shadows on the walls
Of moments far too troubling to recall
All the settings and the scenes
That signal suffering
Impassioned pleas that ended in a whisper

In all the lessons learned,
Were they worth the ash from all the bridges burned?
Standing, stomping in the damage and
The ruins of a slip of tongue
With tragic consequences

I think that we've all made our gravest mistakes
On the greatest intentions that we're too stubborn to let go

With this little time before I go,
I'll open up my mouth,
And scream it out
To cast my voice
Into the crowd

Now that you're alone,
Is it really so impossible to know
All the actions and reactions
Pinned against each other
Never really end just how you want it

I think that we've all made our gravest mistakes
On the greatest intentions that we're too stubborn to let go

With this little time before I go,
I'll open up my mouth,
And scream it out
To cast my voice
Into the crowd

I know that all of this will come and go
So open up your mouth
And scream it out
To cast your voice
To the crowd.

So open up your mouth
And scream it out
To cast your voice
To the crowd.

(Don't let the world bring you down)
