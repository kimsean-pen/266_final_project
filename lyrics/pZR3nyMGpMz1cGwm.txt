Hundreds of things, I've never said
Clear the air let me talk instead.
Quit twisting the strings that you stitched in my back.
Take off your shoes while you roam in my head
Selfish enough to leave a mess instead.
You left a mess in my head.

You're wasting, your time here.
My mind's made, don't intrude on my space.
I'm pulling all my teeth
To try and feel something.

Pace the floor again
Thinking back to when we began.
I'm just not ready
I'm just not ready, to go
With nothing left to show

Break the knot we tied strong.
All the time we spent wrong.
Always speaking with tongue, in cheek.
My interest in you is bleak.

You're wasting, your time here.
My mind's made, don't intrude on my space.
I'm pulling all my teeth
To try and feel something.

You're wasting, your time here.
My mind's made, don't intrude on my space.
You're wasting, your time here.
My mind's made, don't intrude on my space.
What?
