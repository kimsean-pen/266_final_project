We walk this earth
With fire in our hands
Eye for an eye
We are nemesis

We are with you
Countless vicious souls
Fight! Fighting for freedom
United we stand
We stand

We are legion
Voice of anarchy
This is revolution
Creating new disorder

We are enemy
Opponent of the system
Crushing hypocrisy
Slaying the philistine

One for all
All for one
We are strong
We are one
One for all
All for one
We are one
Nemesis

A malicious fever burns
In our hearts in our veins
Your blood my blood
All blood runs the same
The same

One for all
All for one
We are strong
We are one
One for all
All for one
We are one
Nemesis

We are nemesis

One for all
All for one
We are strong
We are one
One for all
All for one
We are one
Nemesis
