War is coming swiftly
The border's closing in
We're a company of soldiers
Mere forty rifles strong!

All alone!
Stand alone!

Ardenner ground is burning
And Rommel is at hand
As the Blitzkrieg's pushing harder
The war is all around!

All around!
Hold your ground!

Fight for eighteen days of battles
No odds are on our side
Few will fight for all, until the bullets are gone

We, we will resist and bite!
Bite hard, cause we are all in sight!
We, we take up arms and fight!
Fight hard, resist and do what's right!

No matter how we're fighting
Their numbers will still count
We're outgunned and few in numbers
We're doomed to flag and fail!

We fought hard!
Held our guard!

But when captured by the Axis
And forced to tell the truth
We will tell them with a smile
We'll surprise them with a laugh!

We are all!
We were all!

We were told to hold the border
And that is what we did
Honored war and order seem to spite of our foe

We, we will resist and bite!
Bite hard, cause we are all in sight!
We, we take up arms and fight!
Fight hard, resist and do what's right!

Gloria fortis miles, the Wermacht's closing in!
Adversor et admorsus, the war against the Eagle!

Gloria fortis miles, the Wermacht's closing in!
Adversor et admorsus, the war against the Eagle!

We, we will resist and bite!
Bite hard, cause we are all in sight!
We, we take up arms and fight!
Fight hard, resist and do what's right!
