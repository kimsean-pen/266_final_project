Silence the battlefield sinks beneath my feet
Settle down society

Surrender all we know
Said thanks but I'm okay with what I'm told
I probably should have known better
But I'll learn right from wrong

Better I listen to myself when
I'm burnt from the flames
but still fuel the fire
I can't promise I'll be home
Can't promise I'll be home

Can you hear the casualty call to the none believers?
Justify a cause where we don't deserve to live
Evil minded corporate war for a lost allegiance
Sacrifice all for the cost of innocence

Can't you see that when the time comes
And they call on us
We'll show them the white flag
Soaked in our blood
We're damned if we do, damned if we don't

Silence the battlefield sinks beneath my feet
Settle down society

Sail fort hope, safest seas
How shallow of me to live like my life's misery

Will we be washed up with the wreckage of savior?
And I'm sick of hearing no fault of mine
I can't promise I'll be home,
can't promise I'll be home
Wake up!

We'll show them the white flag soaked in our blood

Far right, far from right
We left the wing because the violence was deafening
Far right, far from right
We left the wing because the violence was deafening

Can you hear the casualty call to the none believers?
Justify a cause where we don't deserve to live
Evil minded corporate war for a lost allegiance
Sacrifice all for the cost of innocence

Can't you see that when the time comes
And they call on us
We'll show them the white flag
Soaked in our blood
We're damned if we do, damned if we don't

Silence the battlefield sinks beneath my feet
Settle down society

A scarlett letter marks us all
We're damned if we do, damned if we don't
