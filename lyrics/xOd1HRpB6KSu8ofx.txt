It started as love
Love leads us to war
Can I really care enough if you never cared at all
Its not the first and it wont be the last
Im an addict for a dramatic life
Its written in my past
Ive seen that part of you
Where I found the bitter truth
Theres nowhere left to hide that could save this life
So Ill say goodbye to you
Wherever you are
you break and you scar
Youll never get the best of me
youll never get that far
As youre breaking down
with no one around
Think of how you got that way
remember who you are
Ive seen that part of you
Where I found the bitter truth
Theres nowhere left to hide that could save this life
So Ill say goodbye to you
Ive seen that part of you
Where I found the bitter truth
