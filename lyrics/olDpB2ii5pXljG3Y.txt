Dissonance rings through this culture
Standards drown intent
There's always something you live for

Tomorrow we die alive
So our feet hit the ground tonight
Is it enough to hold on to?
Hold on to our state of mind

This is our unity
Form into agreement
Unfold
And orchestrate
Are you feeling it now?

This is our unity
Form into agreement
Unfold
And orchestrate
This is our unity

There's always something to live for
(Always a sense of direction)
Why don't you wander with
Divergent visions?

Feeling a of lack of contentment
(Need a relief, new invention)
Are you feeling it now?
Revoke these patterns, undo routines
Are you feeling it now?
Tomorrow we die alive

Tomorrow we die alive
So our feet hit the ground
Tonight

Can you explain
(Can you explain)
Your position?
(Your position?)
What are you afraid to
(What are you afraid to)
Encounter?

Tomorrow we die alive
So our feet hit the ground tonight
Is it enough to hold on to?
Hold on to our state of mind

This is our unity
Form into agreement
Unfold
And orchestrate
Are you feeling it now?

This is our unity
Form into agreement
Unfold
And orchestrate
This is our unity

Make an attempt an amendment
(Not a regret to look back on)
Why don't you wander with
Divergent visions?

Feeling a of lack of contentment
(Need a relief, new invention)
Are you feeling it now?
Revoke these patterns, undo routines
Are you feeling it now?
Tomorrow we die alive

Tomorrow we die alive
So our feet hit the ground
Tonight
