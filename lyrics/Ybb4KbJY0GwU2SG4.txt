Oh, Notorious Lightning! Yes, I had to ride you
And trash the crystal jets they kept in storage inside you!
I was told never to question it.
Now I'm facing twenty years for every night I tried to ingest the snow so lightly! (huh?)
You simply couldn't put down the Black Book.
You dreamt the dreams of the Self-Taught Man.
You warn the ladies not to be corrupted by their looks,
But your voice comes out soft and slanted!
And you're living off what government's granted you:
Amnesty from the true
Thing. Now, Sandra, slowly remove the ring and watch Notorious Lightning surround you.
Watch Notorious Lightning surround you.
Watch Notorious Lightning surround you.
I lay myself down to observe your gilded jeans hit the ground,
And have not grown from this worship.
I lay myself down to surrender,
Watch the trust funds gorge us again,
And have not grown from this worship.
So, Great Pretender, pull a face! Let's see the best 'forlorn you know!'
Just don't sing, "Barricades In The Morning" - it's been three days in a row
And it never comes off like you planned it!
Something once was delivered, then you banned it
But, oh, there is a key to this thing...
Notorious Lightning...
There is a monument.
There is a place within it that I have won.
And there is victory at sea.
And then there's the sun
Crashing down upon us
Faithful readership of the Old Warden. We beg -
"No not another ode to the Garden! You've let the Book of Appeals pile up!"
So, Child of the East, it's time
To shrug off the Beast and take a look at what you've done.
The half-breed jury agrees you're OK,
But what they never seem to say is that it's never
The defense's witness...
and someone's got to fall before someone goes free.
