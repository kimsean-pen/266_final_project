Looking back, I ponder all the possibilities
That I had sat right in front of me
Every one an option or decision
Giving birth to a dedicated universe

Only if I'd known long ago
That a choice will grow
Into another road

But I hope that every single version of events
Will occur whatever we expect
And I search, I really needn't worry very much
'Cause I feel all worlds at once

Only if I'd known long ago
Space is ours to roam
If you can find your own

Reality bruised me
It goes pretty smoothly
But I haven't found the meaning
Quite yet
Only if I'd known long ago
That a choice will grow
Into another road
Only if I'd known long ago
Space is ours to roam
If you can find your own

Who tore the sky, who copied me
Water going back on itself, up to the sea
Is that, a whole world talking from just behind the scene
And, let me get my two-time lines
Not going through the door all alone
I leave something on the set so you know I said hello
