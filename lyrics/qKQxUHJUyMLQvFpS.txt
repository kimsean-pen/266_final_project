I found a place where I can be alone
A space where no one goes
And it's distant like the memories
Of you and me back home
And you're the reason, I'm trying to let go
I finally found my weakness, It's the burden that I hold

Maybe this is perfect
Maybe it's insane
Like chasing California to find rain
Cause it was the last night of self-doubt
And that was the first time I found out
That you were the letdown
You're always a letdown

We're in a poisonous relationship
So where do I begin?
When your lips are just like oxygen
I have to breathe you in
And you're the reason
That I'm trying to let go
I finally found my weakness
And I could never come back home

Maybe this is perfect
Maybe it's insane
Like chasing California to find rain
Cause it was the last night of self-doubt
And that was the first time I found out
That you were the letdown
You're always a letdown

I said what I said cause I was done
I'll put it in the past if it's what you want
Try not to call me when I'm gone
I found a place where I can be alone
Don't call me when I'm gone
A space where no one goes, Now I'm gone

Maybe this is perfect
Maybe it's insane
Like chasing California to find rain
Cause it was the last night of self-doubt
And that was the first time I found out
That maybe this is pointless
Maybe I'm insane
I'd rather be out there in LA
This is the last time I'll have doubts
I'll get to the west coast somehow
I'm chasing California
I'm chasing California
I'm chasing California
I'm chasing California
Don't call me when I'm gone
