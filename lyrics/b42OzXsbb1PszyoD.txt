Stop being mysterious
Tell me what you want
Oh give me something
Something I can work

Oh are you feeling this
Is it just the way the dusk is falling

'Cause I want something real
These days it's hard to feel
And when you call
I cannonball
Dive in too deep
Oh can't you see

That I want something more
Than words that hit the wall
I think I'm ready
So rock me steady
To your shore

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na

Takes time but I'm taking it
Rolling with your curve
It's all or nothing
Could it take some work
You're where the rhythm is
Slowing down the waves of my heart

'Cause I want something real
These days it's hard to feel
And when you call
I cannonball
Dive in too deep
Oh can't you see

That I want something more
Than words that hit the wall
I think I'm ready
So rock me steady
To your shore

Mmm, 'cause I can't stop
When you turn, turn a frown
And I think about the chance
When you're close, say it now
Baby maybe this is it
If you want, let's find out
Baby, don't you say it's over

'Cause I want something real
These days it's hard to feel
And when you call
I cannonball
Dive in too deep
Oh can't you see

That I want something more
Than words that hit the wall
I think I'm ready
So rock me steady
To your shore

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na naa
