I wish I was strong
Would've known from the start
Instead of waiting so long
To reveal what's behind
But there's no use in talking
You made up your mind...

Baby you and I, (are not the same)
You say you like sun (I like the rain)
So before we go through it all again
You better catch yer own train

I wish I was light
I would shine through this tunnel
To the light on the other side
I would brake down this wall
So it could finally see
The truth of it all

You and I, (are not the same)
You say you like sun (I like the rain)
So before we go through it all again
You better catch yer own train
Better catch yer own train yeah
Ahhh...

I said you and I, (are not the same)
You say you like sun (I like the rain)
So before we go through it all again
You better catch yer own train
Better catch yer own train
Better catch yer own train
Better catch yer own train
Better catch yer own train
