I forgot what month it is again
I'm half awake, I know it's wrong
But I swear to God it's almost Christmas
In a language I don't understand
There's a shaking voice on the PA
The other passengers seem nervous

I'm playing
Which song do you want to die to?
Which song do you

I'm suddenly aware of our speed
Sew the world together tightly
Stitch the gaps with pins and strings
And the beacon out there on the wing
It lights the clouds from inside out
And from the ground we look like lightning

I'm playing
Which song do you want to die to?
Which song do you

I'm everywhere at once again
I hear the ocean in the engine
I feel the moonlight creeping in
Maybe it's all in my head
An unknown foreign presence in your bloodstream
I'm a stranger in my bed

I'm playing
Which song do you want to die to?
Which song do you want to die to?
Which song do you want to die to? Oh no
Which song do you

I'm flashing back to us one night in a prairie town
(Tornado alley, outrunning a storm)
They can see the dirt there under my fingernails
(I'm just a pile of bones left on an airport floor)
The bags under my eyes have got space when you bottom out
(To pack your things and make a break for the door)
One day the things you love are gonna put you in the ground
(But I'm planning on running 'til I can't anymore)

Which song do you want to die to?
Which song do you want to die to?
Which song do you want to die to? Oh no
Which song do you
Which song do you
Which song do you
