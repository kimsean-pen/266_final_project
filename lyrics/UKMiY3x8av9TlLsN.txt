Out of this zone, trying to see
I'm so alone, nothing for me
I guess I'll go home, try to be sane
Try to pretend, none of it happened
Oh, this old tree, lonely old me
Whoopsie-daisy, I thought I was happy, oh

Out of this zone, now that I see
I don't need them and they don't need me
I guess I'll go home, try to be sane
Try to pretend, none of it happened
Destined to be, lonely old me
Whoopsie-daisy, I thought I was happy, oh

Ah, why won't they talk to me? (I thought I was happy)
Ah, why won't they talk to me? (I thought I was happy)
Ah, why won't they talk to me? (I thought I was happy)
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?

But I don't really care about it anyway
I wouldn't listen to a word any others say
They just talk about themselves all day
One day I'll be a star they'll be sorry

Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
