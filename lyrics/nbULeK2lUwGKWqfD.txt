It's a sleepless night, she's callin' your name
It's a lonely ride, I know how you want her
Again and again, you're chasin' a dream, yeah
But Johnny my friend, 'cause she's not what she seems

Johnny B, how much there is to see
Just open your eyes and listen to me
Straight ahead, a green light turns to red
Oh why can't you see? Oh Johnny B

And when you drive her home, is she sittin' real close
Does she make you weak? Well that's the way that she wants you
You're strung out again, she's taken you over
You've been here before, why can't you let go?

Johnny B, how much there is to see
Just open your eyes and listen to me
Straight ahead, a green light turns to red
Oh why can't you see? Oh Johnny B

And when she calls your name, my sweet Johnny B
You can drive all night and you know she'll be waiting
To love you again, her kiss is her poison
Forever inside you, wherever you go

Johnny B, how much there is to see
Just open your eyes and listen to me
Straight ahead, a green light turns to red
Oh why can't you see? Oh Johnny B

Johnny B, how much there is to see
Just open your eyes and listen to me
(Just listen to me)
Straight ahead, a green light turns to red
Oh why can't you see? Oh Johnny B
Oh, can't you see? Oh Johnny B
Oh, can't you see?
