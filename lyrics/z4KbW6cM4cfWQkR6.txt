Let me tell you 'bout the legend of the wild horse
She escaped from the racetrack, ran away and never came back
From the dark forest

For sanity I remember this
Now that I'm fenced in ba-dum ba-dum
Just like before, I swore
I'll be your warrior (warrior)
I swore I'll be your warrior (warrior)
I swore I'll be your warrior (warrior)

Yeah I've been punched up ba-dum ba-dum
Ten times or more, I swore
I'll be your warrior (warrior)
I swore I'll be your warrior (warrior)

The legend of the wild horse
She got lost on a golf course
She got locked out of a life-force
Or sanity I remember this

Now that I'm fenced in ba-dum ba-dum
Just like before, I swore
I'll be your warrior (warrior)
I swore I'll be your warrior (warrior)
I swore I'll be your warrior (warrior)

Yeah I've been punched up ba-dum ba-dum
Ten times or more, I swore
I'll be your warrior (warrior)
I swore I'll be your warrior (warrior)

Now that I'm fenced in ba-dum ba-dum
Just like before, I swore
I'll be your warrior (warrior)
I swore I'll be your warrior (warrior)

Yeah I've been punched up ba-dum ba-dum
Ten times or more, I swore
I'll be your warrior (warrior)
I swore I'll be your warrior (warrior)

Before you knew me
I'd dive from the roof
I'd swing from the trees and hang from the moon

Now that I'm fenced in ba-dum ba-dum
Just like before, I swore
I'll be your warrior (warrior)
I swore I'll be your warrior (warrior)

Yeah I've been punched up ba-dum ba-dum
Ten times or more, I swore
I'll be your warrior (warrior)
I swore I'll be your warrior (warrior)

Yeah I've been punched up ba-dum ba-dum
Ten times or more, I swore
I'll be your warrior (warrior)
I swore I'll be your warrior (warrior)
I swore I'll be your warrior (warrior)
I swore I'll be your warrior (warrior)

I was the wild horse
