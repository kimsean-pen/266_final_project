I just want you for myself, nobody else
We've been going back and forth like a church bell
Boy, I sat and wish you lied to my fucking face
Baby you're so bad to me and it's clear as hell

I just want you for myself, did I say it too late?
Found out there's another girl that's on your case
Left to be a loser, baby won't you stay?
Think you're dope as hell and now I want my way

Now I want my way, now I want my way
Now I want my way, now I want my way
Love me like your money, love me like your money
Love me like your money, love me like your money
Now I want my way, now I want my way
Now I want my way, now I want my way
Love me like your money, love me like your money
Love me like your money, love me like your money

I just want you for myself, I put on a show
Love you better than the others, you don't even know
Tell me why you're never here and always doing road
Baby when it's time to leave, I don't wanna go

I just want you for myself, did I say it too late?
Found out there's another girl that's on your case
Left to be a loser, baby won't you stay?
Think you're dope as hell and now I want my way

Now I want my way, now I want my way
Now I want my way, now I want my way
Love me like your money, love me like your money
Love me like your money, love me like your money
Now I want my way, now I want my way
Now I want my way, now I want my way
Love me like your money, love me like your money
Love me like your money, love me like your money

Love me like your money, love me like your money
Love me like your money
