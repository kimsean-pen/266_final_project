Hear the madmen call
Hear the madmen call
Walk in the forest, what do I see
A wooden house in the trees
I can feel people here and there
But I can't see a wall anywhere
Every time I look away
Every time I look away
Every time I look away
Every time I look away
I hear the madmen call
Hear the madmen call (It's the madmen call)
Hear the madmen call (It's the madmen call)
I walk on looking for something new
A lake comes into view
I can feel the spirits call
I look around, but there's no wall
Every time I look away
Every time I look away
I hear the madmen call
I cross the lake to the other side
A spirit hands me a meteorite
I throw it down and walk some more
But I don't see no wall at all
Every time I look away
Every time I look away
Every time I look away
Every time I look away
I hear the madmen call
Hear the madmen call (It's the madmen call)
Every time I look away
I'm swallowed up again
Every time I look away
I'm staring at a wall
Every time I look away
Look away
Every time I look away
I hear the madmen call
