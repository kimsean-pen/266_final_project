Rethink everything
Sorry don't mean the same
Won't remember my name
So easy for anything
Love me like you complain
And I say

Why do we all get it wrong?
You were right all along
I'm a cry baby
And do you cry baby?
Am I where I belong?
I don't know what you're on
I'm a cry baby
And do you cry baby?

You've got nothing to say
Crying baby my way
Won't remember the game so
Save me and do it again
Love me like your so strange
And I say
Hey you, I wanna know

Why do we all get it wrong?
You were right all along I'm a cry baby
And do you cry baby?
Am I where I belong?
I don't know what you're on
I'm a cry baby
And do you cry baby?
Oh
Oh, oh
I'm a cry baby
And do you cry baby?

So beat me
And do it again
Love me after a day
And I say...

Why do we all get it wrong?
You were right all along I'm a cry baby
And do you cry baby?
Am I where I belong?
I don't know what you're on
I'm a cry baby
And do you cry baby?
Why do we all get it wrong?
You were right all along I'm a cry baby
And do you cry baby?
Am I where I belong?
I don't know what you're on
I'm a cry baby
And do you cry baby?
Oh

Why do we get, why do we get
And do it again
Why do we get, why do we get
Won't remember the game so
Save me and do it again
