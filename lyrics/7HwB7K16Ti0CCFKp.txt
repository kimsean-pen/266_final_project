Now I know why, you couldn't breathe
Locked in a life that you can't leave
Now I know why you couldn't heal
Stuck in a world that you can't feel

In silence you are fading
Trembling and breaking
[?] you're mistaken
But you're numb to what you need
Did someone rip you open?
And break what has been broken?
Before there's nothing left to bleed

You drift into the darkest skies
I can see the life leave your eyes
It's buried beneath your crooked grin
It's fighting to fuel the fire again
[?] hand of time
Drowning in the taste of your lies
[?] shine, now it dies within
You're lost in the life that you're living in

And I can see you're living
But you're not alive

The scars you're creating
Struggling and freaking
When will you awaken,
And succumb to the disease?
Like a whisper in the weather
Nothing lasts forever

Now I know why, you couldn't breathe
You lived in a life that you can't leave
Now I know why you couldn't heal
Stuck in a world that you can't feel

You drift into the darkest skies
I can see the life leave your eyes
It's buried beneath your crooked grin
It's fighting to fuel the fire again
[?] hand of time
Drowning in the taste of your lies
[?] shine, now it dies within
You're lost in the life that you're living in

And I can see you're living
But you're not alive
But you're not alive

(You're not living!)

You drift into the darkest skies
I can see the life leave your eyes
It's buried beneath your crooked grin
It's fighting to fuel the fire again
[?] hand of time
Drowning in the taste of your lies
[?] shine, now it dies within
You're lost in the life that you're living in

And I can see you're living (Living!)
But you're not alive (Living!)
But you're not alive
