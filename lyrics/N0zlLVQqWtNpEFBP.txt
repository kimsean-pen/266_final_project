This is the end, this is the end
You wait to find that I'm still here
And you've been waiting for the light to shine

Wake up, wake up, wake up

I'll be the answer to the question
I can't answer, it's a question
You can't spit it out, can we find,
We find, we find a way out, a way out

It's easier to understand
We die, we're buried underground
But I have stayed awake since then
You tried to find a new best friend
You instigate, come after chasing
Oh, what the hell should I say, then?
I've missed you,
let's spend the future talking about the past
How you said goodbye,
how I fucked your mind up

We really are something else
Let's say you were sent here
Just to keep me in check
My pulse is quick, my neck is stretched
Whoever says I need to just

Get over it, get over him, get over myself

They say there's something in our sky,
We should pay attention
I don't care to realize
I'm too busy moping
They say there's something in our seas,
we should all be careful,
I'm not swimming anyway,
I'm too busy moping,
They say there's something in my house,
that I should just get out, get out,
I don't want to be escaping, no,
I'm too busy moping around
I'm too busy moping around
I'm too busy moping around
I'm too busy moping around
I'm too busy moping around

Take a run home, I don't like where you're going
Run home, I don't like the words you're saying
Run home, I don't like where you're going
Run home, I don't like the words you're saying

Take a run home, I don't like where you're going
Run home, I don't like the words you're saying
Run home, I don't like where you're going
Run home, I don't like the words you're saying
