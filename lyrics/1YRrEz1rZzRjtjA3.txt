(Stacy Epps)
Give me a little bit, a little bit
Just a little bit, or a lot

(repeat 2X)
Pieces of the dream that I pick up in my mind
is not blind, of our love
Everyday when I look into your brown eyes
I get high, on our love

(Stacy Epps)
I, I get high, look in your, brown eyes
I get high-iiiiiiii-iiiiiii-iiiiiigh
Higher, higher, hi-igher, -igher
-igher, -i-igher, higher, you make me higher
I fly (I fly) I fly (I fly)
I fly (I fly) up high
I fly - take me there, I fly - take me there
I fly
