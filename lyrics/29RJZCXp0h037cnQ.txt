Gods got a plan, makin' it clear
Sweet little love song in your ear
Like hearts made of diamonds
Love will prevail
Put a little wind in your sail
I'd do anything, anything you can dream of
I'd do anything, anything for your love
For your love
Listen now baby, tell you true
Just how much that I love you
I gotta sweet feelin', I know it's real
Kind of love you can't conceal
I'd do anything, anything you can dream of
I'd do anything, anything for your love
For your love

I'd do anything, anything you can dream of
I'd do anything, anything for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
