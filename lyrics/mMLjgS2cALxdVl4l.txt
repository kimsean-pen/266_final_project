Every time you bake I wanna eat cake
I really got a thing about you
Listen to the bang of my heartbeat
You know you really own the room
You got the cards in your hand, know how play them
You know just how to get your man
If still waters never made a good sailor
Then I'm a storm baby here I am

I got a thing about, why d'ya go n bring it out
I got a thing about you
I'm not in or out, should I scream or shout
I gotta let it out ooh it's true

Gotta thing---gotta thing, God I wish you'd walk in
Gotta thing that's true, a thing about you
Gotta thing---gotta thing, I've already got the ring
Anyway would do, gotta thing about you

You know just how to make a big dog bark
You make me wanna wag my tail
You can warm any heart or burn the house down
It's something that you never out grew
You are the girl that my mother warned me 'bout
Still I really got a thing about you

I got a thing about, why d'ya go n bring it out
I got a thing about you
I'm not in or out, should I scream or shout
I gotta let it out ooh it's true

Gotta thing, gotta thing, I've already got the ring
Anyway would do, gotta thing about you

She's the boss, she's the best, she's the better than the rest
She's an eleven, pure heaven, got the goods I be getting
She's got the gods, I'll be getting

Now I've got a thing about, why d'ya go and bring it out
Why've I got a thing about you
Don't know if I'm in or out, should I scream or should I shout
I know I gotta let it out it's true it's true

Gotta thing, gotta thing, God I wish you'd walk in
Gotta thing that's true, a thing about you
Gotta thing, Gotta thing, I've already got the ring
Anyway would do,
gotta thing about you
