Empty bottle
Crowded goth show
What is it that you want to do?
Whatever it is, I do too
I'll let you decide if this is hello or goodbye
Or if this isn't anything
If I'm not really anyone
I'm not coming down if you're not coming down
In my dreams, I'm asleep
You're in the bed
We speak French and the floor is made of glass
Empty bottle
Reflective window
What is it that you hope to see?
Look beyond yourself, you will find me

I'm not coming down, you're not coming down
In my dreams, I'm asleep
You're the bed, and "Isn't Anything" never ends
