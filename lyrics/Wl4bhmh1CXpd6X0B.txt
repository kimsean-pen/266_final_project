You walk into the room like king of the world
Like you could have your pick of all of the girls
There's rumors you've been lookin' all over town
Tryin' to hook someone for jammin' around
I got new for you, this time it is over
Boy, I see right through, we are going nowhere
I'd rather starve than eat your pretty little lies
Oh, oh, oh!

This is my absolutely final, I am really leaving, goodbye
Every time I take it back, you do me over, goodbye
Check your back, get in a cab and don't look back it's goodbye
Absolutely final, I am really leaving, goodbye

I Spelled it out do you get it now?
I Spelled it out do you get it now?
I Spelled it out do you get it now?
Haha, huh, I'm telling you
At first you showered me with all your attention
Tryin' to do some things I can't even mention

You wanna have your way, and still kiss the girls
But you are living in a dream world
I got news for you, this time it is over
Boy, I see right through, we are going nowhere

I'd rather starve than eat your pretty little lies
Oh, oh, oh!
This is my absolutely final, I am really leaving, goodbye
Every time I take it back, you do me over, goodbye

Check your back, get in a cab and don't look back it's goodbye
Absolutely final, I am really leaving, goodbye
These games that you're playin', I play and I'm stayin'
No use in wasting, that clever little mouth you

Can't kid a kidder, the sweet taste is bitter
Boy I found you out!
I got news for you, this time it is over
Boy, I see right through, we are going nowhere
I'd rather starve than eat your pretty little lies
Oh, oh, oh!
This is my absolutely final, I am really leaving, goodbye
Every time I take it back, you do me over, goodbye
Check your back, get in a cab and don't look back it's goodbye
Absolutely final, I am really leaving, goodbye
