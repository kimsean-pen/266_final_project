Don't know why
I can't function
In this dead ends
Impossible

I don't know why
It's not that I
That I don't try
It's not easy

Don't know why
I can't function
In this dead ends
Impossible

I don't know why
It's not that I
That I don't try
It's not easy

Bury your head, bear your heart
But I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
Bury your head, bear your heart
But I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't

Nothing can stop this creeping fear
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
Nothing can stop this creeping fear
I can't, I can't, I can't, I'm Leaving

Bury your head, bear your heart
But I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
Bury your head, bear your heart
But I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't

Nothing can stop this creeping fear
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
Nothing can stop this creeping fear
I can't, I can't, I can't, I'm leaving

I'm Leaving
I'm Leaving
I'm Leaving
I'm Leaving
I'm Leaving
I'm Leaving
I'm Leaving
I'm Leaving

Bury your head, bear your heart
But I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
Bury your head, bear your heart
But I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't

Nothing can stop this creeping fear
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
Nothing can stop this creeping fear
I can't, I can't, I can't, I'm leaving

I'm leaving
I'm leaving
I'm leaving
I'm leaving
I'm leaving
I'm leaving
I'm leaving
I'm leaving
