I always see the light way before the dark
And you always see the end way before the start
I've been trying and; finding that things going right
Aren't as simple as everyone told me they would be
I know that you miss me
I'm sorry I'm busy
And; don't make the time
For the things you ask from me

Out of breath
Out of time
Is it your turn?
Is it mine?
I can't sleep tonight
I can't sleep tonight, no
Is it fine, if we find
That in time this isn't right
I can't speak tonight
I can't speak tonight, no

Just make me feel special
And make me feel loved
Make me feel something
Lately life's made me numb
I just want to hold you
For just long enough
So you don't get tired of me telling you
I love you so much

If I take care of you
Who's gonna take care of me
I could just say take care and leave
But I love how you stare at me
I stay cause I'm scared to leave
I'm not prepared to be
Lonely without you see
That just won't feel right
I need you in my life

Out of breath
Out of time
Is it your turn?
Is it mine?
I can't sleep tonight
I can't sleep tonight, no
Is it fine, if we find
That in time this isn't right
I can't speak tonight
I can't speak tonight, no

Just make me feel special
And make me feel loved
Make me feel something
Lately life's made me numb
I just want to hold you
For just long enough
So you don't get tired of me telling you
I love you so much

So don't make me, no
Don't make me go
Don't make me

In a city I don't know
Hit me three times 'fore the show
I need sleep tonight
You'll be in my dreams tonight, tho'
