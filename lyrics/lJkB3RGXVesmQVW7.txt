Angelene where could you be,
the skin on my chest feels so warm
I've been gone since the morning sun,
My lonely heart yearns for more

Angelene where have you been
I'm weary and stuck in my head
Marble skies in the evening sun
I'm lost and I carry the dead

Angelene where could you be
I dived and I swam with the ghosts
There's one sea between us now
That's just what kills me the most

Angelene where could you be
I dived and I swam with the ghosts
There's one sea between us now
That's just what kills me the most
