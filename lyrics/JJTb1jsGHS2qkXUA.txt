Hey
do it now
yeah hey

Yeah, once I was a boogie singe
playin' in a rock & roll band
I never had no problems, yeah
burnin' down the one night stands
And everything around me, yeah
got to start to feelin' so low
And I decided quickly (yes, I did)
to disco down and check out the show

Yeah, they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down that boogie and play that funky music till you die
(hey, hey)
till you die... yeah, yeah

Well, I tried to understand this Yeah, huh,
I thought that they were out of their minds
How could I be so foolish,
(How could I)
tonight's the hours, the one behind
So still I kept on fightin'
Wow, loosin' every step of the way (Yeah, what'd you do?)
I said, "I must go back there" (Got to go back)
and check to see if things still the same

Yeah, they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down that boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die... (Yeah)
oh, till you die

(Come on... Play some electrified funky music)

(Hey, wait a minute) Now first it wasn't easy
changin' rock & roll and minds
And things were getting shaky
I thought I'd have to leave it behind
Oh, but now its so much better (It's so much better)
I'm funkin out in ev-er-y way
But I'll never lose that feelin' (No I won't)
Of how I learned my lesson that day

When they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down that boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die...
