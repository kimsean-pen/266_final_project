satisfy my soul, let the day begin
make the evening roll, let the big sky in
satisfy my heart, it's so good to feel
love is all around, and all the hurt will heal

oh, this is what my heart needs to feel
oh, this is what my heart needs to feel

satisfy my soul, take away this pain
something has to end, to begin again
satisfy my heart, it's so good to feel
love is all around, and all the hurt will heal

oh healing, every moment, every wish you have comes true
healing, every feeling, that is about to come to you
satisfy my soul, let the day begin
make the evening roll, let the big sky in
satisfy my heart, it's so good to feel
love is all around, and all the hurt will heal

oh this is what my heart needs to feel
oh this is what my heart needs to feel
(whoo, to feel)
oh this is what my heart needs to feel
(need to feel baby)
oh this is what my heart needs to feel
(ooh)
