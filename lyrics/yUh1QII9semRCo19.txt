Believe in magic
believe in lore, legend and myth
And the hand that guides
in the cunning if hope
in the weaving of dreams
And the lady of the lake
takes my hand and leads me
to the holy isle
and the fairy rings
and the circles of stone
Forever and again

Give me, give me, give me, deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me

Surrender
to the wisdom of age
and the spirits of time
Remember
our souls entwined for eternity
And the healing hand of the fairy queen
will come to all who have faith in her
And the apple tree will bear it's fruit
in the gardens of Avalon
Forever and again

Give me, give me, give me deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me
Give me, give me, give me, deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me

Let me sleep for a while
and dream of Avalon
and the Beltane fires
And a silent kiss steals away
into the mist and out to the lake
Where the sword will rise again
From the water into the hands of the chosen one
The righteous one
Forever and again

Give me, give me, give me, deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me
Give me, give me, give me, deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me

Give me, give me, give me, deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me
Give me, give me, give me, deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me
Give me, give me, give me, deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me
