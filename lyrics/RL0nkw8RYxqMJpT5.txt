Get up get up get up get up
Lift your head
C'mon C'mon
Get up out of bed
Today's the day you hold the world with
your song

Go now go now go now
Help ascalate
Angels come down, help with this parade
To hear your voice ring out
C'mon and shout out and let you song be
heard

Chorus:
This is the time
This is the day that we've been waiting
for
All the world will stop to watch you shine

Hey now hey now hey now hey now
Sing your hymn
This is the new national anthem
We will all stand on guard to let you be
heard

Let go let go let go
All the cannons
How beautiful this world has become
Now everyone will see what i believe that
these words should be sung

Chorus:
This is the time
This is the day that we've been waiting
for
All the world will stop to watch you shine
This is the time
This is the day that we've been waiting
for
All the world will stop to watch you shine

And if you fall
And if you fall
And if you trust then yes it will come true

Hey hey yeah

Chorus:
This is the time
This is the day that we've been waiting
for
All the world will stop to watch you shine
This is the time
This is the day that we've been waiting
for
