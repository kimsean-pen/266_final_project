Beautiful ruin
Portrait built from splinters of youth
Stairway to nowhere
The connection from me to you
Distort normalcy
Validate malignancy
The smear of spite detaches me
Brings me to my knees
Pain means nothing without purpose
Love means nothing without roots

Beautiful ruin
Portrait built from splinters of youth
Stairway to nowhere
The connection from me to you
Distort normalcy
Validate malignancy
The smear of spite detaches me
Brings me to my knees

Pain means nothing without purpose
Love means nothing without roots
Nothing...

Pain means nothing
Love means nothing
Pain means nothing
Love means nothing
