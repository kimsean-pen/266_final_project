Enjoy, enjoy
Don't destroy a good thing, good thing
Enjoy, enjoy
Don't destroy a good thing, good thing

So you're bitter and depressed
You don't wanna get dressed
You don't wanna answer the phone (Enjoy)
You wanna stay in bed
You wanna bury your head
You want the world to leave you alone (Enjoy)

Enjoy, enjoy
Don't destroy a good thing, good thing
Enjoy, enjoy
Don't destroy a good thing, good thing
If you can't enjoy yourself
Who can you enjoy?
(Enjoy, enjoy)

(Enjoy, enjoy)
Gotta look inside, gotta dig real deep
Gotta find that place where the child sleeps
You can do it, don't think twice
You've got control, yeah, it's your life (Enjoy)
If you want to, if you want to (Enjoy)
(Enjoy)

Take my advice, cut your troubles in half
By changing that moaning into a laugh
Laugh

Enjoy, enjoy
Don't destroy a good thing, good thing
Enjoy, enjoy
Don't destroy a good thing, good thing

So you wanna scowl and frown
Well, that just brings you further down
You know that celebration's more your style (Enjoy)
If the world should end today
I want to be able to say
That I went out with a smile

Enjoy, enjoy
Don't destroy a good thing, good thing
Enjoy, enjoy
Don't destroy a good thing, good thing

If you can't enjoy yourself
Who can you enjoy?
(Enjoy, enjoy)
If you can't enjoy yourself
Who can you enjoy?
