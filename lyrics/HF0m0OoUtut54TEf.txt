After all the people picking people picking people apart, my love
And after all the dealing,
the hooking and reeling along from the start

Oh there's a field, meet me there
Out beyond rightness and wrong, meet me there

Woman you're leaving, loving, you're leading me on
Living I'm alive, sweet woman, keep loving me on

Cause they wake up every morning with the cradle in their hands,
but they pretend it's a game
Acting like the only place the truth could ever live
was up on Shacklewell Lane

Oh there's a field, meet me there
Please come along, tie back your hair

I tried yesterday, it takes me so long to say,
but I need you to know
Darling you show, by leaving me so,
the only way to hold on is keep letting go

Oh there's a field, meet me there
You know I'm on my way, please meet me there

Oh there's a field, meet me there
Out beyond rightness and wrong, meet me there
I'm on my way, meet me there
Please come along, tie back your hair

After all the people picking people picking people apart, my love
