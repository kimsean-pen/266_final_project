Let's take off our masks & be so naturelle
Let's behold ourselves & break this evil spell

I think that I'm good just because I behave
But I've reached stalemate / I'm a self made cage
They poked me with a stick because they wanted to see
If I was alive or just pretending to be
But my bones are in my body / Not in my grave
Turns out I am free & I pretend to be a slave
Yes the window still opens if the door is closed
Afraid to die free / Afraid to die alone

Yes the window still opens if the door is closed
Afraid to die free / Afraid to die alone
Like diamonds form from pieces of coal
Uh-huh / Uh-huh
Use your pressure / This is your magic tool
This is the way to form a precious jewel
Come on / Come on
Come on / Come on
Woo!

Let's take off our masks & be so naturelle
Let's behold ourselves & break this evil spell

Come on / Come on
Come on / Come on
Come on / Come on
Come on / Come on
Woo!

Not afraid to die free & not afraid to die alone
Come on / Come on
Not afraid to die free & not afraid to die alone
Come on / Come on
Woo!
