Let's go,
Baby I gotta have some more,
(Turn the track up)
What's it gonna take to get a score,
(Turn the beat up, yeah)
Got me like a fiend banging on your door,
(I think I want some of that)
Why don't you meet me on the floor?
And then?

Step into my office won't you like
To try a sample, a taste of my stuff
Yeah c'mon
I've got a million different flavors
All the boys say they can't get enough,
Once I'm under your skin you're begging me for more,
You'll get addicted to this but baby you've been more,
Don't let these innocent eyes fool you
When I'm on the floor, the floor, the floor

Cause I could be your dealer,
I can be your only friend when you need her,
I'll keep you coming back again,
You can call me anytime I can make you feel fine,
Look into my bag of tricks if you need a fix,
Then I'm your dealer, Hey!
Love love dealer, Hey (check it out)

All those other pushers they say
They got that good stuff that you already know
(You already know what it is)
That they can't do what I do - oh no,
I'll take you places you never thought you'd go,
I can get you so high with the things I do,
You get a rush in your veins and we start to move,
Don't let these innocent eyes fool you
When I'm on the floor, the floor, the floor,

'Cause I could be your dealer,
I can be your only friend when you need her,
I'll keep you coming back again,
You can call me anytime I can make you feel fine,
Look into my bag of tricks if you need a fix,
Then I'm your dealer, Hey!
Love love dealer, Hey (check it out)

You can call me anytime I can make you feel fine,
Look into my bag of tricks if you need a fix,
Then I'm your dealer, Hey!
Love love dealer, Hey (check it out)

Break It Down

Baby I gotta have some more,
Eyes roll back and you feel dizzy,
What's it gonna take to get a score,
Now you got me in your system.
Got me like a fiend banging on your door,
So now you know what you've been missing,
Why don't you meet me on the floor?
And then?

Break

You ain't gotta say that you like it,
I can tell by the look in your eyes,
Won't you give it a try, you'll be mine,

'Cause I could be your dealer,
I can be your only friend when you need her,
I'll keep you coming back again,
You can call me anytime I can make you feel fine,
Look into my bag of tricks if you need a fix,
Then I'm your dealer, Hey!
Love love dealer, Hey

'Cause I could be your dealer,
I can be your only friend when you need her,
I'll keep you coming back again,
You can call me anytime I can make you feel fine,
Look into my bag of tricks if you need a fix,
Then I'm your dealer, Hey!
Love love dealer, Hey
