I don't have to like the things you say sometimes
Then I don't like the things I say
Now vows and consonants our weaponry
We vowed to love eternally

And I hear your pain screaming
And I hear your pain
In the silent evenings
We used to be happy
We used to make happy
On the stove
On our own

Satiny luscious chocolate
I don't hate you
I don't hate you
Satiny luscious chocolate
No, I need to be more like you
Satiny luscious chocolate
Within the tension of your opposites
Satiny luscious chocolate
Somehow the lingering sweetness
Satiny luscious chocolate
Without betraying your bitterness
Satiny luscious chocolate
I don't hate you
I don't hate you
Satiny luscious chocolate

I don't have to like swinging from extremes
The lows so low, the highs so high
From throwing knives to dessert stirring
Our tight rope act just balancing

And I hear your pain screaming at me
Hear your pain screaming
We used, used to be
We used to make happy
We used to make, make happy

Satiny luscious chocolate
I don't hate you
I don't hate you
Satiny luscious chocolate
No, I need to be more like you
Satiny luscious chocolate
Within the tension of your opposites
Satiny luscious chocolate
Somehow the lingering sweetness
Satiny luscious chocolate
Without betraying your bitterness
Satiny luscious chocolate
I don't hate you
I don't hate you
Satiny luscious chocolate
I don't hate you
I don't hate you

Hear your pain screaming
We used to make happy
We used to make, make happy
In a cauldron on our stove
A fair fire sweer water
We used to make, make happy
We used to make happy
