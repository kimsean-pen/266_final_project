Sometimes it's hard
to make things clear,
I know when to face the truth
And I know
when the moment is here

I'll open my heart
and show you inside,
my love has no pride
I feel with you,
I've got nothing to hide

so open your eyes
and see who I am
And not who you want for me to be
I am only myself, myself

I don't wanna lose you now,
we're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now
forever

Baby I finally found
the courage to stand my ground
But if you want me, I'll be around
forever

We all make mistakes,
we all lose our way
But we stood the test of time
and I hope
that's the way it will stay
It's all up to you
to tell me to go
'cause it won't be me to walk away
When you're all that I know
and I know

ThatI don't wanna lose you now,
we're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now
forever, never

Baby I finally found
the courage to stand my ground
But if you want me, I'll be around
forever,
forever, yea yea

I don't wanna lose you,
lose you now,
we're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now,
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna lose you
