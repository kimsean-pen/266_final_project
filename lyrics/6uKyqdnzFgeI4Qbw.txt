Baby, won't you lie here with me?
And take this scrolling sober, mmm
Is it over?
Let us savour its last

Baby, won't you lie here with me?
I'm running on empty, ooo
It's taking over, mmm
And I long to be free

Have you walked along the cut stone friend?
The air is changing, ooo
And this breathing on
And it is seating bare
And with it's leaning on me
And I long to be free

Lie with me
Under fluorescent
Baby, won't you cry with me?
Till the rising sun
Baby, won't you lie with me?
Under fluorescent
Baby, won't you cry with me?
Till the rising sun
Baby, won't you lie with me?
Though I long to be free
Baby, won't you lie with me?
Though I long to be free
Baby, won't you lie with me?
Though I long to be free
Baby, won't you lie with me?
