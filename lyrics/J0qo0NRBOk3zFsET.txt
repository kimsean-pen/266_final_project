Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Yeah, time goes by and still I am stuck on you, you
I've been afraid don't wanna fade out of my body
I've been astray, barely awake, floating above me
Covered in grey what can I say, I've been a zombie
I'm feeling like I've been locked in a grave

You were the laugh, you were the life, you were the party
You were the brave, I was the weak, you were the army
You were the faith, you were the truth, I was the sorry
I'm feeling like you've been taken away

You were my one, you were my one
When all has been said, all has been done
You were my one, you were my one
Now I am left reaching above me, oh

Time goes by and still I am stuck on you, you
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you, you

Why did you leave, why did you go leaving me lonely?
Didn't you know you were the home, you were the only
Where did you go, where did you go, where did you go?
Come back to me

You were my one, you were my one
When all has been said, all has been done
You were my one, you were my one
Now I am left reaching above me, ho

Time goes by and still I am stuck on you, you
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you, you
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Yeah, time goes by and still I am stuck on you, stuck on you
Oh-oh-oh...
As time goes by, as time goes by
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you, you
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you, you
