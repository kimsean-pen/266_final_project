Johnny Thunder lives on water
Feeds on lightning
Johnny Thunder don't need no one
Don't want money
And all the people of the town
They can't get through to Johnny
They will never, ever break him down
Johnny Thunder speaks for no one
Goes on fighting
And sweet Helena til then prays for Johnny

Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba
Thunder and lightning
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba
Thunder and lightning

Though everybody tried their best
Old Johnny vowed that he would never
Ever end up like the rest
Johnny Thunder rides the highway
Moves like lightning
But sweet Helena just says, "God bless Johnny"

Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba
Thunder and lightning
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba
Thunder and lightning
