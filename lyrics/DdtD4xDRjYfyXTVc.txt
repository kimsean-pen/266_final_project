Now I rest my head from
Such an endless dreary time
A time of hopes and happiness
That had you on my mind

Those days are gone and now it seems
As if I'll get some rest
But now and then I'll see you again
And it puts my heart to the test

So when are all my troubles gonna end?
I'm understanding now
That we are only friends
To this day I'm asking
Why I still think about you

As the days go on I wonder
Will this ever end?
I find it hard to keep control
When you're with your boyfriend

I do not mind if all I am is
Just a friend to you
All I want to know right now
Is if you think about me too?

So when are all my troubles gonna end?
I'm understanding now
That we are only friends
To this day I'm asking
Why I still think about you
So when are all my troubles gonna end?
I'm understanding now
That we are only friends
To this day I'm asking
Why I still think about you
