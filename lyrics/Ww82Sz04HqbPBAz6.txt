This ain't the first or last time
We'll meet up this late at night
To let our fate intertwine
Casually I'd rather be
Detach from all tragedy
This don't need to be defined

And I know that it's wrong
I do I do
Baby keep holding on
I do I do
Yeah, I know that it's wrong
I do
When the sun comes up, I'll be gone

I only know him in the dark
I only know him in the dark

Try to stay desensitized
Keep my feelings out of mind
My body won't be denied
Never took this road before
Love was always at the core
Of anyone I've been with before

And I know that it's wrong
I do I do
Baby keep holding on
I do
Yeah, I know that it's wrong
I do
When the sun comes up, I'll be gone
Chorus
I only know him in the dark
I only know him in the dark

Shadows across your face
Your lips a familiar taste
Stay focused, I tried
Can't get this out of my mind
I want more than what this is
Whatever we're calling this
The truth just breaks my heart

I only know him in the dark
I only know him in the dark

I only know him in the dark
I only know him in the dark
