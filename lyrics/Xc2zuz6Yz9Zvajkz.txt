past the billboards and the magazines
I dream about being with you
we can't hear a word they say
let's pretend we own the world today
I know its cold outside
but when we're together i got nothing to hide
hold on tight i will never let you down
it can't rain on our side of town
wipe the sweat from my hair
tell me we're not better off
wipe the tears from my face
the sunnyside of the street where we are
