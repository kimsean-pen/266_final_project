Enter a scene that defies description
They say to open your mind
And take it all inside
One click at a time

We move through fictions
And send our sisters to the sacrifice
A cruel conviction
Sinister systems keep us satisfied
These are hard times

I'm breathing in, the oxygen
I'm holding it, through hard times
I'm breathing out, in the ultrasound
Things come around, in hard times

Ten thousand miles of the new prescriptions
So we open our mouths
And take 'em all inside
One pill at a time

The purist fictions
We send our sisters to the sacrifice
With cruel conviction
Sinister systems keep us satisfied
These are hard times

I'm breathing in, the oxygen
I'm holding it, through hard times
I'm breathing out, in the ultrasound
Things come around, in hard times

(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh)

(We send our sisters to the...)

A new religion
We send our sisters to the sacrifice
And then the audience goes wild!

I'm breathing in, the oxygen
I'm holding it, through hard times
(These are hard times)
I'm breathing out, in the ultrasound
Things come around, in hard times
(These are hard times)
I'm breathing in, the oxygen
(Take it all inside, take it all inside)
I'm holding it, through hard times
I'm breathing out, in the ultrasound
Things come around, in hard times
