I've been sleep walking
Through the railway station
Wake me up
When they call my destination
Where I've been
I was bound to leave behind
All device
And all disease was mine

Ahh
Speeding out of reach
Ahh
You're the one I had to meet

I never wanted to go home
(The wanderlust will carry your song)
There was nothing there for me
(The wanderlust will carry your song)
In a high rise on my own
(I've been on all kind of highways for so long)
Looking out in a mirrored balcony
(The wanderlust will carry your song)
Will there ever be a place for you and me
(The wanderlust)

I'm rolling in
For a seven day weekend
Living up again
To my old reputation
Can you cover me
'Cause I got no armour
Keep moving on down the line
Keep on going further

Ahh
Speeding out of reach
Ahh
You're the one I had to meet

I never wanted to go home
(The wanderlust will carry your song)
There was nothing there for me
(The wanderlust will carry your song)
In a high rise on my own
(I've been on all kind of highways for so long)
Looking out in a mirrored balcony
(The wanderlust will carry carry carry your song)
I don't know where to go, now I got nowhere to hide
(Nowhere to go nowhere to be)
I don't know where to go, now I got nowhere to be
(Oh wanderlust will carry your song)
Walk fifty city blocks down but they always find us
(The wanderlust will carry your song)
Will there ever be a place for you and me
(The wanderlust will carry your song)
Will there ever be a place for you and me
