Internal void
swallows me whole
I feel so empty, I feel so cold.

Plagued with uncertainty
Walls Closing in on me.
Reach for a helping hand
for someone that understands

I've become a mere shell of the man that I used to be
the man that i know, the man that I am.
in silence I sit
Thinking of this
hoping to feel
different about it
devoid of emotion I am so spent

Plagued with uncertainty
Walls Closing in on me.
Reach for a helping hand
for someone that understands.

Quickly sinking
reaching for nothing.
Sinking.
Reaching.
For nothing.
Sinking
