When I disappear, do you fear for the sister I took?
When I disappear, it is clear I am up to no good
I am drearily blunt, letting this bed wetting cosmonaut
"Son, the last thing you'll realize
you need is what you've already got"

So touch me or don't
Just let me know
Where you've been

So drop me a line with a hook and some raw bleeding bait
(one, two, three, four)
For I am uncaught and still swimming alone in the lake
(five, six, seven, eight)
Shimmering under a moon made in anger and angst
Shimmering like a penny out of reach in the subway grate
(Shimmering like a coin kept safe away
you'll never listen to anything)

So touch me or don't
Just let me know
Where you've been

We could leave it alone
I'm sure there's someone who knows
Where you've been

You never worked well with our group
Not with the faults we found
So we fixed you with cement galoshes
No one can save you now
Unless you have friends among fish
There'll still be no air to breathe
You could drink up the entire ocean
I'll still find someone to be everything we know that you'll never be

So touch me or don't
Just let me know
Where you've been

Or we could leave it alone
I'm sure there's someone who knows
Where you've been
