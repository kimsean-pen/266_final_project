Blow weed, coke, pop X
Speedin' up the heartbeat bangin' in my chest
When you put it on me you relieve my stress
You got me so high, takin' deep, deep breaths
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug but, you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug but, you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high, high

You got me so turnt up
This dude gotta be so high
Weed always on my mind
Now he always on my mind
Doja.
Know you want some of this purr
You ain't gotta say a word
Just spark that let's get burnt, uh
Then we'll roll up
A hunnit fuckin' blunts
All up in my mouth
Now I'm all up in yo...
This nigga got pounds of it
All up in his trunk
Now we both look Asian
He wavin' and I'm drunk
I got dank shit in my cup
You know what I'ma do to you
I could get real used to you
Blow, weed, X and we sipping on that juicy-juice
That's just what she choose to do, uh
Man, this shit these drugs will do to you

Blow weed, coke, pop X
Speeding up the heartbeat bangin' in my chest
When you put it on me you relieve my stress
You got me so high, takin' deep, deep breaths
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug but, you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug but, you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high, high
