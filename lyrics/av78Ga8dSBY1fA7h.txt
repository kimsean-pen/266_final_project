Pull up in that err-err

Eat food from my labor
'Fore that shit expire
My bih keep it too real and that's why I never could play her
Told her that I wanna fuck some hoes just to be fair
She kept that shit so G and said, "Won't we fuck 'em together?"

We go together, like peanut butter, jam

I learned a lot, we burned the pot, we broke the mold
Got a new crib, house on the hill

And I'm off tequila, mockingbird might fly ya to me, shawty
Wingspan, wingspan
Tings in Brixton, Kingston
Shakin', Jamaican
