I'm here to tell you that ahhhh I'm feeling like a butterfly
There's no denying that ahhhh I've always loved the high life

Never needed real emotions, I get my feelings from a magazine
I don't know where you got the notion
I'll be the one fullfilling all your needs

I'm here to tell you that ahhhh I'm feeling like a butterfly
There's no denying that ahhhh I've always loved the high life

Get physical tonight, the world's alive
Get physical in the light, this is our time
Get physical tonight, we're riding high
Get physical in the light, going out, feel allright,
It's a magical night, it's a magical night,
It's a magical night, it's a magical night

You can't desert me
I'm always going when I just arrived
There ain't no memories gonna hurt me
Cause all I live for is tomorrow night, ahah

I'm here to tell you that ahhhh I feeling like a butterfly
There's no denying that ahhhh I've always loved the high life(liiiife)

Get physical tonight, the world's alive
Get physical in the light, this is our time
Get physical tonight, we're riding high
Get physical in the light, going out, feel allright,
It's a magical night, it's a magical night,
It's a magical night,(maaagical night) it's a magical night

Sorry, I'm not a lady, I ain't afraid to pick a fight
I'm here to conquer the dancefloor
And the lights, delight

I'm here to tell you that ahhhh I'm feeling like a butterfly
There's no denying that ahhhh I've always loved the high life

Get physical tonight,
Get physical in the light, (aaaah)
Get physical tonight,
Get physical in the light, going out, feel allright,

Get physical tonight, the world's alive
Get physical in the light, this is our time
Get physical tonight, we're riding high
Get physical in the light, going out, feel allright,

Get physical tonight, feel allright
Get physical in the light, going out, feel allright
It's a magical night!
