Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

You showed me my tomorrow
Beside a box of matches
A welcome threatening stir

My hopes of being stolen
Might just ring true
Depends who you prefer
Ooh, ooh

But if it's true you're gonna run away
Tell me where, I'll meet you there

Am I snapping the excitement
If I pack away the laughter
And tell you how it feels
Ooh

Does burden come to meet ya
If i've questions of the feature
That rolls on your dream reel
Ooh

The day after you stole my heart
Everything I touched told me
It would be better shared with you, with you

And now you're hiding in my soup
And this book reveals your face
And you're splashing in my eyelids
As the concentration continually breaks

I did request the mark you cast
Didn't heal as fast
I hear your voice in silences
Will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud?

In the jostling crowd
You're not allowed to tell the truth
And the photo booth's a liar
Ooh, ooh

There's a sharpened explanation
But there's no screaming reason to enquire
Ooh, ooh

I'd like to poke them in their prying eyes
With things they'd never see
If it smacked them in their temples
