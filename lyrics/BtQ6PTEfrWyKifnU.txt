You're tellin' lies
So don't you criticize
Yeah I got used
All messed up and abused

You let me down
With all your runnin' round
Still you pretend

And try to call me friend

Don't say your word
I know just what I heard
Yeah you've been loose

You just go no excuse

Just feel my rage
Why can't you come of age

I felt it all
Just like a cannonball

Then you got mad
You said that I'm all bad
So what's the use
You lied and that's the truth
You took the key
And drove right out on me
I never knew
Put all my trust in you

OK that's it
I'm leaving now, I quit
I was unwise
Don't apologize

I paid the price
For taking your advice
I felt it all
Just like a cannonball

You can say what you want all day
But I've never been so outraged
I'm washing my hands of you
How could you be so untrue
You know I can't stand no more
You know I can't stand no more
I can't stand no more
Can't stand no more
No
