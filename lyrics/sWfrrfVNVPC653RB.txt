Last transmission from the stars
Get your arse to mars
Where a lane of silver sparkle
Will read bad memoirs

Rising from the dead
The leader of the coup
What the fuck's this button do
Cause I don't know

This house, so much to answer for
Talking to the wall
And all it does is haunt in his mother's tongue

All the splendour you can find
Out of body, out of mind
Did you inherit a poisoned chalice
Stick to beat yourself to death with
A counterfeit

Hail the player and the game
They're one and the same
I flock to all that you don't get through the gate

The gutter and the stars
Are not too far apart
With love to follow (too far and?) just take me back to the start

Heaven fell asleep again
Died a death by poison pear
What you ask is pornographic
Bet these lies are sonic honesty
Honesty
Honesty

Oh, the player and the game
They're one and the same
I'd love to know that you don't get through the gate

The gutter and the stars
Are not too far apart
But with love to follow (fall in?) just take me back to the start

You think I can't tell that you're hungry
This song is gonna die alone
