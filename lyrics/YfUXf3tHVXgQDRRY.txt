Kids are kids, understand
Out late, going crazy, kids innocent
Kids are kids, understand
Out late, going crazy, kids innocent

The girls just want fun
The boys we make noise
The girls kiss the girls
I thank god
The kids will be alright
Just fine
I heard about all of the long trials in life
All the drugs on my mind
All the troubles I can find
Still I smile

The kids will be alright
Just fine
All the colors are alive
No longer black or white

Uh
Kiss the kids, call you baby daddy
Tell em' who's daddy
Call your papi
Tell em' that you happy
Shout it loud so they all know how you feel exactly
Inside sunny energize
Think about it like you feelin' alive
On the mama boy she swear to god
Lady said that she ain't into guys
Brand new 'cedes with the intercom
Table made is for the dinner vibe
Ain't a killa so don't kill the vibe
Disrespect them that's a different side
Adderall and alcohol
The teachers called, the doctor called
The block too hot the Marshall called
See em' grow and watch em' crawl

Hands touch the wall
The kids do the lines
Alright
Just fine
The kids turned out fine
The kids turned and run
I heard about all of the long trials in life
All the drugs on my mind
All the troubles I can find
Still I smile

The kids will be alright
Just fine
Smoke weed, pour a line
The kids turned out fine
I pour a line
I lose my mind
