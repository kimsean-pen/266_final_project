My teeth mean nothing to me
Unless I am in-between shoulders
Your laugh, I'm weak in the back seat
Where I'm smiling
Trespassing in old buildings
Doing what we've gotta do
Before I grow up in a couple months

But what do I know about happiness?
Making it out of thin air
No oxygen
But I heard you say it
You won't be happy again

But that doesn't mean I can't try
We can be that age
Young, naive, and brave
Not scared to care for someone
When all I can say is
"I'll do what I can"
It's sad to say
I'd be anyone's anything
If they'd let me
