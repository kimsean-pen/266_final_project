Come on, fellow friends
We have things to achieve
Come on, I said
We have work to deliver
Come on, we need
To be armed to the teeth
Double in size, double in will

Come on, fellow friends
We have things to achieve
Follow, I said
We have work to deliver
Come on, we need
To be armed to the teeth
Double in size, double in will

Gather all your hidden forces
Every anon, all your sources
There is work for clever minds
Changing one world at a time

You know we got work to do
You know we got work to do
(No) There's nothing for us here
(No) We have to cross that river
(No) You never felt a taste so sweet
As the taste of blood and victory

Come on, fellow friends
It's not the self we need
(I keep on working, working as I am walking)
Come on, I said
Oh, it's what we do together
(I keep on working, working as I am walking)
Come on, we need
The letter i is me
(I keep on working, working as I am walking)
Whatever came next is history
(I keep on working, working as I am walking)

Gather all your hidden forces
(I keep on working, working as I am walking)
Every anon, all your sources
(I keep on working, working as I am walking)
There is work for clever minds
(I keep on working, working as I am walking)
Changing one world at a time
(I keep on working, working as I am walking)

You know we got work to do
You know we got work to do
You know we got work to do
(You know we got work to do)
(You know we got work to do)
(You know we got work to do)
(You know we got work to do)
