Please don't leave me in the morning
We haven't had enough time
I don't want you to go, baby
For you are always on my mind

I can't stand all this silence
Meet me outside
I'd sooner die than know you hate me
I just want you for my own

People might say that our love is not real
But I can't help loving you my dear

I will remember this
Never forget about you
Oh, when I close my eyes
You and I will stay in time
And when the years go by
Seasons will change outside
Nothing will change my mind
You and I will stay in time

I can't help to watch you, baby
How you move in disco lights
I just wanted you to see me
The moon was burning bright

People might say that our love is not real
But I can't help loving you my dear

I will remember this
Never forget about you
Oh, when I close my eyes
You and I will stay in time
And when the years go by
Seasons will change outside
Nothing will change my mind
You and I will stay in time
