I'm in love with a TV star
She drove me home in her Lexus car
Like a dog but I don't watch her show
Spend my time with the Radio
Seen her dancing on the Sunset Strip
Bellbottomed Jeans, and a-curvy hips
Seen her sitting there with her boyfriend
Good looking fella but he's looking kinda thin

I love you so

Remember that day we played pool
I saw your bedroom and we ate barbeque
Bobby came from a trip down town
Fifty up and forty down
Love you more than the sun and the sky
Gotta kiss and hug you [be]fore I die
Something else that you ought to know to
Did something wierd

I'm in love with a TV star
She drove me home in her Lexus car
Like a dog but I don't watch her show
Spend my time with the Radio
Been watching TV as the years go by
I've seen 'em born, and I've seen 'em die
Something else you aught know to
I like a girl named Helen [could be Ellen] more than you
