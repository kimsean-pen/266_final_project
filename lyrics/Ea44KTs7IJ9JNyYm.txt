I'm so confused and I think I'm gonna cry tonight
What must I do babe?
You don't know what you mean, oh
Tell me something
Tell me could this really be

You're so unpredictable
Why must you treat me this way
I want you to love me for who I am

Whatever happened to the dream we used to share
Where did our love go
Boy, don't you even care?

Chorus:
Tender kisses blown away
Tender kisses gone tomorrow gone today
Tender kisses bye baby bye baby

Don't leave, leave me here all alone
I want someone I can call my own
I may be young but I'm ready
Ready to fall in love

Im so confused, your so unpredictable
trust in me as i trust in you
put our hearts together theres nothing we can't do

Whatever happened to the dream we used to share
Where did our love go
Boy, don't you even care?

Chorus

Bridge:
I wonder if you ever loved me
Tell me, was I so blind that I could not see
holding on to the memories
Of the way you used to kiss me
All I ever really wanted
Was someone to call my own
I'll never know
You'll never know
We'll never know
All those tender kisses blown away

Bye baby bye

Chorus
