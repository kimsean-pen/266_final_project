There's opal in my mind all the time
It shakes all 33 vertebrae in my spine
There's something straight above up in the sky
The sutra gave a new soul lansing that's amplified

I wanna be thrown back to nowhere
Yet everything brings us back to nowhere
I wanna be thrown back to nowhere
Yet everything brings us back to nowhere

There's opal in my mind all the time
It shakes all 33 vertebrae in my spine
There's something straight above up in the sky

I wanna be thrown back to nowhere
Yet everything brings us back to nowhere
I wanna be thrown back to nowhere
Yet everything brings us back to nowhere
I wanna be thrown back to nowhere
Yet everything brings us back to nowhere
