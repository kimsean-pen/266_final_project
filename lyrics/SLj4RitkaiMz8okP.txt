you missed the winter and it followed you back home
where sun kissed the crimson footsteps in the melting snow
we are doing our best to disown the golden mean
by disacts of cruelty in the name of beauty to be free

the acoustic funeral for love in limbo
we're dancing with tags on our toes
I saved my last breath for your window
to write you this song for the acoustic funeral

on the verge of a vow to kill all reason locking that door
to a nightmare within a nightmare we are bound to adore
let the pleasure in the shape of a heart lie to me
and finally confirm all fears to be so real
be so real

the acoustic funeral for love in limbo
we're dancing with tags on our toes
I saved my last breath for your window
to write you this song for the acoustic funeral

underneath the ice so thin i am turning blue (im turning blue)
the one last thing i know to be real is the shadow of you
killing love with a kiss

the acoustic funeral for love in limbo
we're dancing with tags on our toes
I saved my last breath for your window
to write you this song

the acoustic funeral for love in limbo
(the acoustic funeral for love in limbo)
we're dancing with tags on our toes
(we're dancing with tags on our toes)
I saved my last breath for your window
to write you this song for the acoustic funeral

lest we have to fall
for the acoustic funeral

killing love with a kiss
