Everybody's all drunk
Everybody's had enough
It's getting ugly
I'm so tired, so tired, so tired
So take me home

It's getting late for me
I'll come if you wait for me
Let's get out of this place
Never changes, it just stays the same
Just take me home, c'mon let's go

I just wanna run away
I've had it here
I just gotta get outta here
I've had it here

I just wanna run away
I'm done with this
Grab your coat
Just take me, take me

Just take me back to your house, your house
C'mon, take me back to your house, your house
Just take me home
Don't wanna go home all alone
No, no, no, no

Just take me back to your house, your house
C'mon, take me back to your house, your house
Just take me home
Don't wanna go home all alone
No, no, no, no

Just put a record on
Make it a country song
C'mon make a drink for me
Let's sing along
To songs of vacant hearts

Let's stop all the talk
Let's take it easy now
We don't have to worry
'Bout anything at all until the dawn
Just take me home, c'mon let's go

I just wanna run away
I've had it here
I just gotta get outta here
I've had it here

I just wanna run away
I'm done with this
Grab your coat
Just take me, take me

Just take me back to your house, your house
C'mon, take me back to your house, your house
Just take me home
Don't wanna go home all alone
No, no, no, no

Just take me back to your house, your house
C'mon, take me back to your house, your house
Just take me home
Don't wanna go home all alone
No, no, no, no

Take the keys to my car
Let's drive

I'm lonely, so lonely
Can I come home with you?
I'm lonely, so lonely
Can I come home with you?

My head is spinning circles
Think I need a rescue
I don't know why
I just feel like chilling with you

I'm chilling with you
I'm chilling with you
I'm chilling with you

Just take me back to your house, your house
C'mon, take me back to your house, your house
Just take me home
Don't wanna go home all alone
No, no, no, no

Just take me back to your house, your house
C'mon, take me back to your house, your house
Just take me home
Don't wanna go home all alone
No, no, no, no

Don't you wanna get out
Get out, get out?
Take the keys to my car
Let's drive

I'm lonely, so lonely
Can I come home with you?
I'm lonely, so lonely
Can I come home with you?

My head is spinning circles
Think I need a rescue
I don't know why
I just feel like chilling with you

Like ice melting in the stream
I can hold on to how I used to be
A better man would understand
Will you?
