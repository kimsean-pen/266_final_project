Loving you isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
How can I, when you won't take it from me?

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way

Tell me why everything turned around
Packing up, shacking up is all you wanna do
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
Open up, everything's waiting for you

Oh, you can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way

Hey, you can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day

Ohhh...
Ohhh...

You can go your own way
Oh, you can go, you can go
You can call it another lonely day
Oh, call it another lonely day
Yeah, you can go your own way
Go your own way
