She said, with the cancer-curing voice of an angel,
That "I bet the rain is colder when you're standing next to me."
And the ten ten reasons why I'm still alive,
Could fill the backseat of your girlfriend's ride.

Enter the Void of our simple minds,
And he will lead you through December
With his hands tied behind his back,
He will leave his comfort in your hands,
To keep his comfort and conscious from ever coming back

Never. Never. Never.

A scale to keep still.
This plague will "Burn Your Bones"
And this cold, cold city is his home,
And there he stands, supreme, supreme, supreme.
