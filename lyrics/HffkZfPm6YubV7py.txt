I'm gonna tell you about love
Let's forget your life
Forget your problems
Administration, bills and loads
Come with me

In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

In the demonstration of this evidence
Some have called it religion
This is not a coincidence
Would you like to try?

Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride their ambitions high, would you like to try?
Let me be your guide, cut inside your pride
Future lovers hide love inside their eyes

In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

Love controlled by time
Future lovers shine for eternity in a world that's free
Put away your past, love will never last
If you're holding on to a dream that's gone

I'm gonna tell you about love
Would you like to try?

In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

There's no love like the future love
Come with me

Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride their ambitions high, would you like to try?
