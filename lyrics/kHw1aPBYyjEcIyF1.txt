Ladies and Gentleman open up your eyes and ears and listen up! Listen up!
Calling all cars! Calling all cars! Calling all cars!
Let's put an end to the Charade.
Show me what you're living for.
You think it's obvious, you're so obvious.
I spit my teeth out on the floor.
Don't tell me, I don't want to know!

I breath revenge tonight. It never tasted to sweet.
And baby, if I choke things down for a second
then maybe I can starve this tragedy.
Don't tell me, I don't want to know!

So get your story straight
I can think of one reason for you to call home tonight
If I had my way you would find out the hard way
Causing trouble is my business and the business is good
So now I'm calling all cars! Calling all cars! Calling all cars!
It's time to show you my battle scars.
And let you know that I'll be coming back for more

I breath revenge tonight. It never tasted to sweet.
And baby, if I choke things down for a second
then maybe I can starve this tragedy.
Don't tell me, I don't want to know!
Don't tell me, I don't want to know!

I'll let you know that I'll be coming back for more
It's too late for me, Kid
These words are too true
When your heart beats only lies, you're dead inside

And god forbid when you find yourself off and remembering on
And god forbid when you can't find the switch in the words
To a song but it's too late to see me though, Kid

I breath revenge tonight. It never tasted to sweet.
And baby, if I choke things down for a second
then maybe I can starve this tragedy.
Don't tell me, I don't want to know!
Don't tell me, I don't want to know!
