Up all the night with the radio
star peppered black draping over me
walking down the street
bad blood to napalm ratio
no love in class for the absentee
walking down the street
call up the party high priest
oh where oh where do the people go
and their having a party

61 cygni avenue
watcha gonna do when they come for you

I'm just looking for the party
i'm just feeling for the heart beat

kim walks the block fot the antidoe
givin the leather clad third degree
walking down the street

but all 2 bucks gets is an anecdote
and a paranoid schizo reciting every major historic
outbreak of the past 80 years
walking down the street

we got something in store for you
we got something in store for you
at subway's end

cause we're having a party at
61 cygni avenue
watcha gonna do when they come for you

I'm just looking for the party
i'm just feeling for the heart beat
