This is the hardest thing I'll ever have to say
I guess I do exaggerate
But it's so hard to say goodnight
Just one more drink, please come inside

I hold a bottle in each hand, one red, one white
You say whichever I will like
You see the look that's in my eyes
And so you ask what's on my mind

Oh, if it gets you out of that dress tonight
Should I be honest? Should I lie?
If I had a chance to decide, I'd

Give up the ghost, free up the soul
Just for another night as a note in your symphony
The way you play every inch of me
Tempo is slow, waves come and go
Just like the rising tide as I swim through your sea of skin
Got every inch of you trembling

Another day, our seventh date
A little party at your friend's
That will extend through the week's end

But now it's late and there's too many for the car
Too cold at night to walk that far
We suck it up and take the trunk
Lucky for them, luckier for us

Oh, I simply could never get enough
You've got me wondering if it's love
Even if it's not, it's enough to

Give up the ghost, free up the soul
Just for another night as a note in your symphony
The way you play every inch of me
Tempo is slow, waves come and go
Just like the rising tide as I swim through your sea of skin
Got every inch of you trembling

Give up the ghost, free up the soul
Just for another night as a note in your symphony
The way you play every inch of me
Tempo is slow, waves come and go
Just like the rising tide as I swim through your sea of skin
Got every inch of you trembling

Baby, come in from the cold
So glad you're home
Will you spend the night?
And maybe your life with me
