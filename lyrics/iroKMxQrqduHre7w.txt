Somebody's screaming, looking at the ceiling,
Everything's so funny, I don't have any money.
People don't even know me, but they know how to show me.

Why can't you be nicer to me?

My pride is dying, I think I'm all done lying.
Nobody's sharing, so I stop caring.
All alone and walking, nobody's talking.

Why can't you be nicer to me?

Well, the wind is blowing, where am I going?
Off a bridge and falling, nobody's calling.
On the ground and laying, nobody's praying.

Why can't you be nicer to me?
