Oh, oh, oh
Ain't gonna moan no more
Oh, oh, oh
Ain't gonna moan no more
Ain't no wolf at my door
Ain't gonna moan no more

From the ol' groaner
To the deep, deep blues
Muddy Waters and John Lee, too
From the master of vocalese
John Hendricks sang it with ease
Ain't gonna moan no more

Satchmo Jo's playin' the crowd
It didn't stop him layin' it down
He chose to smile
Instead of frown
He kept playin' his gigs and
Movin' from town to town, alright

No time to frown
Ain't gonna moan today
Goin' to town, gonna make my day
Do my best to, create all a better space
Ain't gonna moan no more, man
Around this place

Willy the Shake said that
Life is what you make it
Somebody else said
Fake it 'til you make it but I'll
Feel much better when my
Feet are touching the ground
I get Hip to the Tip
When I hear that lonesome sound

Some people's down
Someone else is upbeat
Transform the norm
Tryin' to make it sweet
When you know things are happenin'
Well, just can't be beat
When you know the score
You don't have to moan no more

Oh, oh, oh
Di, dip, di, dip
Ain't gonna moan no more
Do lup, do lup, do lup, do lup, do lup, do lup, do lup, do lup
Whoa ho
Ain't gonna moan no more
Do lup, do lup, do lup, do lup, do lup, do lup
Ain't no wolf at my door
Ain't gonna moan no more
Oh, oh, oh

Ain't no wolf at my door
Ain't gonna moan no more
Sing it one more time

Oh, oh, oh
Hey
Ain't gonna moan no more
Do lup, do lup, do lup, do lup, do lup, do lup
Oh, oh, oh
Ain't gonna moan no more
When you know the score
Don't have to moan no more
Hmm hmmhmm ahuh
