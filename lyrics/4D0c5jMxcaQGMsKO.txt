Let out your strength from within, from within
Then you will begin to appreciate the hope
In this graceful world

Breathe in the waters, the clouds, and the dews
Put out the fires taking control over you
Poke down a hole, bury a sapling
Flourish, let it flourish
Hearts shall become a forest

Poe layrha, layrha
Bodum phesphoe
Bodum mallumi ca
Bodum brad idas

Seek from within, from within
Then you will begin to see past uncertainty
Let out your cries from within, from within
Remember who you used to be
Everyday can be your new beginning

Tes luna vi luna
Sol sollus a esta
Esta la estralla vi
Vive tex eta
Tes luna vi luna
Sol sollus a esta
Esta la estralla
Dalla dalla katrera
