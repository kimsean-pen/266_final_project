I'm not afraid of your dropped eyes.
Just wanna slow it down.
Ele you touch me makes me feel so nice.

Sticky hands understand.
That I can't be without you.
Tricky arms in the men.
Cause I can't fair with you.

Ohh, I thought we go.
How much we know.
Can you classed with me?
I thought with love.
How much we show.
Can you classed with me?
I thought we go.
How much we know.
Can you classed with me?
I thought with love.
How much we show.

Thinking are strange how you making bounce.
Don't wanna slow it down.
I like watch how you do your pants.

And this dance in advance.
But some fans deep inside my mind.
Like a chance I would glance.
Cause I need it one more tim–µ.

Ohh, I thought we go.
How much we know.
Can you classed with me?
I thought with love.
How much we show.
Can you classed with me?
I thought we go.
How much we know.
Can you classed with me?
I thought with love.
How much we show.

Get lost with me...
Get lost with me...
Get lost with me...
Get lost with me.

Come get lost with me, lost with me.
Lost with me, get lost with me.

Come get lost with me!
Lost with me! Lost with me!
Get lost with me!

Come get lost with me!
Lost with me! Lost with me!

I thought we go.
How much we know.
Can you classed with me?

I thought with love.
How much we show.
Can you classed with me?
