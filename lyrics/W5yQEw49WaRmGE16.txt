BOUND TO BE MACHINES

You're bound to be machines
accepting what you are, so complete
No holes all though its steep
How ever if you fail, it's ok

I am what I am
(I am what I am)
And I wouldn't change for them
I am what I am
(I am What I am)
I wouldn't bend again

You've never felt the grief
helpless as child, green as leaf
No holes all though its steep
How ever if you fail, it's ok

I am what I am
kör (I am what I am)
And I wouldn't change for them
I am what I am
Kör (I am What I am)
I wouldnt bend again

I am what I am
(I am what I am)
And I wouldn't change for them
I am what I am
(I am What I am)
I wouldnt bend again
