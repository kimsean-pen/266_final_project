I could stare at you for days
Why can't you fuckin' behave?
I know what you like
It's killing my, killing my, killing my
I don't want to go and sin
I got things I must begin
But I like your drive
It's killing my, killing my, killing my
This watch you bought now is broke
Why do you want to provoke
Every line I've paved
You're killing my, killing my, killing my
All you want to do is tease
It's attention that you need
I haven't got time
You're killing my, killing my, killing my

Leave me, baby, please, leave me alone
'Cause right now I can't call you my own
Release me, baby, please, release me from hold
'Cause right now I can't call you my home

Baby, inside I die
'Cause the way you work, yeah, you know you got it
You know me right
You're killing my, killing my, killing my
Your eyes, unkind
'Cause the way you work, yeah, you know you got it
You know me right
You're killing my, killing my, killing my time

You always seem to wear my down
I should know you better now
But you make me weak
You're killing my, killing my, killing my
You are crazy to your core
Just so hard to go ignore
I just want to please
You're killing my, killing my, killing my

Leave me, baby, please, leave me alone
'Cause right now, I can't call you my own
Release me, baby, please, release me from hold
'Cause right now, I can't call you my own

Baby, inside I die
'Cause the way you work, yeah, you know you got it
You know me right
You're killing my, killing my, killing my
Your eyes, unkind
'Cause the way you work, yeah, you know you got it
You know me right
You're killing my, killing my, killing my

And ohh, now you got hold, now you got hold of me
You're killing my, killing my, killing my
And ohh, now you got hold, now you got hold of me
You're killing my, killing my, killing my time

You're killing my, killing my, killing my time
You're killing my, killing my, killing my time
You're killing my, killing my, killing my time

Don't distract me with your body (your body, your body)
Put your clothes back on, I know where this is goin'
Don't distract me with your body (your body, your body)
Put your clothes back on, I know where this is goin'
Don't distract me with your body (your body, your body)
Put your clothes back on, I know where this is goin'
Don't distract me with your body (your body, your body)
Put your clothes back on, I know that you are
Killing my, killing my, killing my time
