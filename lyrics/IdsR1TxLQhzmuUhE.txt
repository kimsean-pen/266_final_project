emptied one at a single draft alone
drained this run
the farthest one can come too close

life could be better if i let me in
(what is to hold on to)
but i force myself towards departing
(leaving is what you do)

i had to make dirty in this soil
i had to be the rascal taking all
i wanted us to live in times of bliss
i couldn't evoke the memories i have missed

left this one
abandoned my ideals for what
(want to be just like you)
moulded like i'm shaped in size with anyone
(stand in line right next to everyone just like you)

i had to make dirty in this soil
i had to be the rascal taking all
i wanted us to live in times of bliss
i couldn't evoke the memories i have missed
shut your eyes fast and all goes blank
and channel the vision feel the scent of
someone who dare to lose it all
and someone who's ready to take the fall for it

shut your eyes and all will be lost

i'm taking all, i'm taking all
as a rascal taking all, i'm taking all
