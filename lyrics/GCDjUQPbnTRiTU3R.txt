I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no satisfaction

Oh, when I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no no, oh no
Hey, hey, hey, hey, this is what I say, yeah, yeah

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no the reaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try, babe
I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction

Oh, when I'm watchin' my TV (Uh, uh)
And that girl comes on and tells me
How tight my skirt should be
But she can't tell me who to be, babe
I've got my own identity (Uh)
I can't get no, oh no no, oh no
I can't get no (uh) satisfaction
I can't get no (uh) satisfaction
I can't get no (uh) satisfaction
I can't get no sa-tis-fac-tion

And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I just can't get no
I can't get no (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Satisfaction (No, no, no)
I can't get no (I can't get no satisfaction)
Satisfaction (Oh)
I can't get no (No, baby)
Satisfaction (This is what I'm saying)
I can't get no (I can't get no)
Satisfaction (I can't get no, no)
I can't get no (I can't, give me)
Satisfaction (I need your satisfaction)
I can't get no (No, baby)
Satisfaction (I can't get no)

(I can't get no) No matter what I do, no matter what I say
(Satisfaction) Everywhere I go, they say it's not OK
(I can't get no) No matter what I do, no matter what I say
(Satisfaction) Everywhere I go, they say it's not OK

I can't get no (I can't get no satisfaction)
Satisfaction (This is what I say)
I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction baby
