I feel ashamed, again and again
Nothing to give, and no-one to blame
During the day, I guess I'm ok

I feel ashamed, again and again
Nothing to give, and no-one to blame
During the day, I guess I'm ok

I feel ashamed, again and again
Nothing to give, and no-one to blame
During the day, I guess I'm ok

I feel ashamed, again and again
Nothing to give, and no-one to blame
During the day, I guess I'm ok

I feel ashamed, again and again
Nothing to give, and no-one to blame
During the day, I guess I'm ok
At night
I sit by your side
Waiting for you, to give me a sign
I'm counting the days
And have nothing to say

Ah I hope I can chill and stay the same
Stop the bleed inside and feel again
Cut the chain of lies you've been feeding my veins
I've got nothing to say to you
I hope I can chill and stay the same
Stop the bleed inside and feel again
Cut the chain of lies I've been beating and beating and beating myself

I feel ashames, again and again,
nothing to give, no one to blame during the day
I guess I'm ok
At night, I sit by your side
Waiting for you, to give me a sign
I'm counting the days, and have nothing to say

Cut the chain of lies, you've been feeding my veins
Cut the chain of lies, you've been feeding my veins
Cut the chain of lies, you've been feeding my veins
Cut the chain of lies, you've been feeding my veins
Cut the chain of lies, you've been feeding my veins
Cut the chain of lies, you've been feeding my veins
Cut the chain of lies, you've been feeding my veins

Ah I hope I can chill and stay the same
Stop the bleed inside and feel again
Cut the chain of lies you've been feeding my veins
I've got nothing to say to you
I hope I can chill and stay the same
Stop the bleed inside and feel again
Cut the chain of lies I've been beating and beating and beating myself

I hope I can chill and stay the same
Stop the bleed inside and feel again
Cut the chain of lies you've been feeding my veins
I've got nothing to say to you
I hope I can chill and stay the same
Stop the bleed inside and feel again
Cut the chain of lies I've been beating myself
without nothing to say to you nothing to say to you
