Ooh-Ooh
Ah, here we go now, oh

Like a great boy, all my other women are insoles
We're thinkin' about the great expedition as popped as we chose

So we come, throwing here all on the scene
Though we go on and on
Come, come, come follow me Britney (Yeah)

Open that soda pop, watch it fizz and pop
The clock is tickin' and we can't stop (Can't stop, no)
Open that soda pop, bop-a shu-bop shu-bop
The clock is tickin' and we can't stop

We might start riding to the music tonight
A clever way to get by, oh
The pops keep flowin' like it's fire and ice
So give it a little blind, ooh

Open that soda pop, watch it fizz and pop
The clock is tickin' and we can't stop
Open that soda pop, bop-a shu-bop shu-bop
The clock is tickin' and we can't stop

Ooh-ooh, we have a plan, we have a definite plan
To level the vibes (Vibes)
To level the vibes again (Ooh-yeah)
See, where ya ba-do for a superlative self (Oh yeah)
A wicked time to the end (Oh yeah)
So

Open that soda pop, watch it fizz and pop
The clock is tickin' and we can't stop
Open that soda pop, bop-a shu-bop shu-bop
The clock is tickin' and we can't stop, no

Open that soda pop, watch it fizz and pop
The clock is tickin' and we can't stop
Open that soda pop, bop-a shu-bop shu-bop
The clock is tickin' and we can't stop

So much pop we're losing, sittin' watching the clock (Watching the clock)
Turn the tables baby, let's go over the top (Take it to the top now)
No one else will do
I'm waiting for you
So show me what you got, just take a pop shot
And we will never stop shu-bop, shu-bop
