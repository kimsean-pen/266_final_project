Saw you coming my way
Put my nose in a book
Some crap that you gave me
Or something that I took,

Man, he looked so good
It had to be ooze leather,
He's so together
Oozing like I never could,

I bet he's a classic masher
He toot toots when he likes the view
Tete-a-tete with his haberdasher,
They talk boots while they're laughing at you,

He's playing dumb
While you're looking at clothes,
Straightening his hat
Mr. Shnook ho-hum,

I shoulda shook his hand
I never used to feel bad
Never felt so blue
Guess I never amused you,

I bet he's a classic masher,
He toot toots when he likes the view,
Tete-a-tete with his haberdasher,
They talk boots while they're laughing at you

I bet he's a classic masher,
He toot toots when he likes the view,
Tete-a-tete with his haberdasher,
They talk boots while they're laughing at you
They talk boots while they're laughing at you
They talk boots while they're laughing at you
They talk boots while they're laughing at you
They talk boots while they're laughing at you
They talk boots while they're laughing at you
They talk boots while they're laughing at you
They talk boots while they're laughing at you
