Wait, it will come
Cold, to the touch
Pray it will call and answer
But I'll try to make you feel the hurt

So quiet down, we're listening to your prayer
It lost their charm and their echo's losing trace
So gather round the murmur of the fire
It's spinning round and it's talking mouth in ear

Feel the hurt
Holy child
Through the womb
Do you cry?
Say the word
Crawl to her
Like a worm
In the dirt

Now we revel in the dirt
Oh, your God is in my
Oh, your God is in my heart
Every single word of your God is in my
Of your God is in my heart

Feel the hurt
Holy child
Through the womb
Do you cry?
Say the word
Crawl to her
Like a worm
In the dirt

Turning it to the light
A needle to the curve
Failing we're losing sight
Of all that was learnt
Watching the pieces fall now
And witness your word
See how the faces fade
With my fingers to the bone
