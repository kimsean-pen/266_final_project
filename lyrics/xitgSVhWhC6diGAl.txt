The fire is gone, a time to search and then replace
I'll never know just how the blind can lead the way

They search for faith,
it shows the way... it leads the way
The distant smile, banished denial, no more denial

Are you the one who tries to send me to the grave
I cannot know who deals the truth who deals the pain

We search for faith
And path to take, you tread in vain
The distant smile, banished denial, no more denial
