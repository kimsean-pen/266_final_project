Life is one big stage
And it's all the rage
To go walkin' out
To take a bow

See me roam
See me climb
If I leave here now
I can make good time
See me fall
See me rise
Grabbing one last look
Then I wave goodbye
Goodbye

Light shines on my face
When I need my space
I've been feeling blue
Well, how 'bout you?
Now this bird has flown
Like I've always known it would
Maybe someday soon
You'll be flying too
oooohhhhhh...

See me roam
See me climb
If I leave here now
I can make good time
See me fall
See me rise
Grabbing one last look
Then I wave goodbye

You try you try to hold on
But it's too late
It's too late I'm gone

Life's a stage
It's all the rage
The curtain's raised
I'm coming out

Life's a stage
The curtains raised
Im coming out
Life's a stage
The curtains raised
I'm coming out

See me roam
See me climb
If I leave here now
I can make good time
See me fall
See me rise
Grabbing one last look
Then I wave goodbye
You try you try to hold on
But it's too late
It's too late
You try you try to hold on
But it's too late
It's too late
It's too late I'm gone
