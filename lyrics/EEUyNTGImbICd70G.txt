Be yourself when you're holding on
Be yourself one day
Be yourself when you're holding on
Be yourself one day
Take on the colors on
And fire fight the winter storms
Be yourself, don't hide your name
If you call it about, don't be afraid
Be yourself when you're holding on
Be yourself one day
Won't cry, won't cry, won't cry
Won't cry, won't cry, won't cry
Won't cry, won't cry, won't cry
Won't cry, won't cry, won't cry
Take on the colors on
And fire fight the winter storms
Be yourself, don't hide your name
If you call it about, don't be afraid
Won't cry, won't cry, won't cry
Won't cry, won't cry, won't cry
Won't cry, won't cry, won't cry
