Three leagues down the soft side of where you left my
Gold rose crown, you broke down and left me with a
Chest hum, a black gun, and forty dollars
Chest hum, a black gun, and forty dollars
Three weeks down I drown myself in whiskey
Came back round, and drowned out, you left me with a
Chest hum, a black gun, and forty dollars
Chest hum, a black gun, and forty dollars

Streetlights talk the same way my mother told me
I walk the same way my father told me
Back straight and chest out, just like a soldier
Back straight and chest out, just like a soldier
Wise men talk the same way my mother told me
I walk the same way my father told me
Back straight and chest out, just like a soldier
Back straight and chest out, just like a soldier

You go down south, south
Streetlights talk the same way my mother told me
I walk the same way my father told me
Back straight and chest out, just like a soldier
Back straight and chest out, just like a soldier
Wise men talk the same way my mother told me
I walk the same way my father told me
Back straight and chest out, just like a soldier
Back straight and chest out, just like a soldier
