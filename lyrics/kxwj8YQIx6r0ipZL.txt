Sometimes livings stock
Stay where i can
Shes dropping my mind
And i ever do want

Can you open your heart?
And leave her alone
Would you be my love
If i change?

Was it all for her
I wish it for me
Will i never learn
Why you're not for me

Through the heaviest doors
I'm not caring [...]
The way of your world
Is only left me

Can you look up your heart?
Tell me i want
Then you can be my love
I can't wait

Was it all for her
I wish it for me
Will i never learn
Why your not for me

Was it all for her
And nothing for me
Will i never learn
Why your not with me

Why do i always feel this way?

Why do i never learn?

Why do i always feel like this?

¿¿Why cant never world??

Was it all for her
I wish it for me
Will i never learn
Why youre not for me

Was it all for her
And nothing for me
I don't understand (understand)
Why youre not with me

Was it all for her
[...] Nothing for me
I will never learn
I can't it compete

Why do i always feel this way?

Why do i never learn?

Why do i always feel like this?

¿¿why cant never world??

Was it all for her
(Why do i always feel this way?)

I wish it for me
(Why do i never learn?)

Will i never know
(Why do i always feel like this?)

Why youre not for me
(¿¿Why cant never world??)

Was it all for her
[...] for me
I will never learn
I cant it complete

Was it all for her...
