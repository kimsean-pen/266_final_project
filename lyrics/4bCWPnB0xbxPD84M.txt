Downtown shutdown
I can feel it
Coming over
Turning my lights out
Downtown shutdown
Taking over
The back of my head
The back of my brain now
Downtown shutdown
Get my move on
I'm feeling kinda let down
I got to get out tonight
Downtown shutdown
Taking over
Yeah this is what it feels like
Downtown shutdown

You'll get the knack of all of this
You'll forget about all of us
All regret you will overcome

You'll get the hang of all of this
Standing on the precipice
I can't believe the view you've got

Into it
Into it
All I wanna
Got to get myself into it.
