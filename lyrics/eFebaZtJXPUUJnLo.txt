Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn it

To my surprise, one hundred storys high
People gettin' loose now
Gettin' down on the roof
I tell you, folks screamin'
Out of control
It was so entertainin'
When the boogie started to explode
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
Burn that mother down now
(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
Burn that mother down
(Burn it)

Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
I tell you, I couldn't get enough
So I had to self-destruct
I tell you, the heat was on
Risin' to the top
Everybody is goin' strong
And that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
Burn that mother down now
(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
Burn that mother down

Up above my head
I hear music in the air, I hear music
That makes me know
There's a party somewhere

Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
I couldn't get enough
So I had to self-destruct
I tell you, heat was on
Risin' to the top
Everybody is goin' strong
That is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
Burn that mother down now
(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
Say burn that mother down

(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
Burn that mother down now
(Burn baby burn)
Disco inferno
(Burn baby burn)
Burn that mother down

(Just can't stop)
I just can't stop
(When my spark gets hot)
Oh when my spark gets hot
(Just can't stop)
Just can't stop
(When my spark gets hot)

(Just can't stop)
(When my spark gets hot)
Just can't stop
(Just can't stop)
Once my spark's got hot
(Once my spark gets hot)
(Just can't stop)
