I was still awake at dawn
When a little spotted fawn
(A little cloud of steam in the morning mist)
Came across the lawn
And I'd been late and long
And I had waited all night long for this
If you'd have seen me last year I'd have said
"I can't even see you there from here"
So Rumi said it best: it's best to let it rest
Do it like them Romans do, I guess
You try and keep em fed, you try and keep your head
You try and keep your robes out of that mess
If you'd have seen me last year I'd have said
"I can't even see you there from here"

She made a sound like fire
Through telephonic wires
And I had waited all night long for this
Was humming soft and low
Was come to let me know
That I had waited all my life on this
If you'd have seen me last year I'd have said
"I can't even see you there from here"
If you'd have seen me last year I'd have said
"I can't even see you there from here"
If you'd have seen me last year honey
"I can't even see you there from here"
If you'd have found me last year honey
"I can't even see you there from here"
If you'd have told me Nashville I'd have said
"I can't even see you there from here"
