Sweet Marie, your beauty shines
You are the water in my eyes
I just wanna be the man, so choose me

I make you sway
I twirl you twice
I do the move that makes you smile
I just want to take your hand and show you

My love
This night is all for you
And we're not gonna waste it
My sweet Marie
You're the only one for me
It's fate
And that's the way we want it
