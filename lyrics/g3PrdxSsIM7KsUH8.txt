They're marching down the street
With heavy boots upon their feet
I saw you in a doorway
You turned and walked away from me

I thought it was surprising
For friends to say goodbye that way
You looked at me in silence
And then you turned and walked away

And if we meet again someday
I know that you won't be the same
When understanding is betrayed
Just walk away, just walk away

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
