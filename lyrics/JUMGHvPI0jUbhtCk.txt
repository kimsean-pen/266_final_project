I can't see straight, can't feel shit
I'm a motherfucking animal, don't you forget it
I wanna get lit, wanna get lit
It's a motherfucking riot so come and get it
So come and get it, so come and get it

We're gonna riot, riot
Kick down the fucking door
Spilling liquor on the floor
We keep on begging for more
We're gonna riot, riot
Everybody roar
We can never get enough
Come on, give us some more

I can't think straight, can't hear shit
I'm a motherfucking savage baby, no regrets
The room is spinning
We'll never quit
This is a motherfucking riot so come and get it
So come and get it, so come and get it

We're gonna riot, riot
Kick down the fucking door
Spilling liquor on the floor
We keep on begging for more
We're gonna riot, riot
Everybody roar
We can never get enough
Come on, give us some more

So come and get it, so come and get it
So come and get it, so come and get it

We're gonna riot, riot
Kick down the fucking door
Spilling liquor on the floor
We keep on begging for more
We're gonna riot, riot
Everybody roar
We can never get enough
Come on, give us some more
We're gonna riot, riot
Kick down the fucking door
Spilling liquor on the floor
We keep on begging for more
We're gonna riot, riot
Everybody roar
We can never get enough
Come on, give us some more

Riot! Riot!
