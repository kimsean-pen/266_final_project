We're a happy family we're a happy family we're a happy family me mom and daddy
We're a happy family we're a happy family we're a happy family me mom and daddy

Siting here in Queens eating refried beans we're in all the magazines
Gulpin' down thorazines we ain't got no friends our troubles never end
No Christmas cards to send daddy likes men daddy's telling lies baby's eating flies
Mommy's on pills baby's got the chills I'm friends with the President
I'm friends with the Pope we're all making a fortune selling Daddy's dope

Siting here in Queens eating refried beans we're in all the magazines
Gulpin' down thorazines we ain't got no friends our troubles never end
No Christmas cards to send daddy likes men

We're a happy family we're a happy family we're a happy family me mom and daddy
(REPEAT TO END: We're a happy family...(12x)
