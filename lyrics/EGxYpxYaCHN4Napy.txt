You'll never miss the water 'til the well runs dry
I offered you everything but you'd rather get high
(Rather get high)

And take it back now
Take it back now
You can't change the loss of feeling
Take it back now
Fade to black now
I can't replace the love you're stealing
I'm not the one

And now you left me out in the dust
I guess for you this wasn't love, it was lust
But I can't take it, the way you fake it
And now you've betrayed my trust
And I was just so blinded in love
I was a fool for thinking that was enough
I watched you take it, I watched you break it
Now everything feels so numb

So call off the dogs
Hurting me won't make you feel any less lost
It's just you and me
She wore the skin of a queen
Owned the heart of a fiend

And take it back now
Take it back now
You can't change the loss of feeling
Take it back now
Fade to black now
I can't replace the love you're stealing now
No, no

Doomed from day one
Can't get love when you have none
Turns out you were dead weight
Crawled back but it's too late
It was all snake oil and cigarettes
A broken home full of hate and empty threats
Curse me, I'm a wretch
Push me to the edge

Hate the ones you love the most
Romance is truly all for show
You aged my heart, changed our fate
Cut me apart 'til death's decay
Who knew this would be trash? (It's trash)
It all burns because nothing lasts
You never miss the water 'til the well runs dry
I offered you every fucking thing but you'd rather get high

And now you left me out in the dust
I guess for you this wasn't love it was lust
But I can't take it, the way you fake it
And now I'm feeling so numb
(I was so blinded)
And now you left me out in the dust
I guess for you this wasn't love it was lust
But I can't take it, the way you fake it
Now you've betrayed my trust
(I was so blinded)
And I was just so blinded in love
I was a fool for thinking that was enough
I watched you take it, I watched you break it
Now everything feels so numb

Take it back now
Take it back now
Take it back now
Take it back now
Take it back now
Fade to black now
