I was blind, now I can see
You made a believer, out of me
I was blind, now I can see
You made a believer, out of me
I'm movin' on up now
Gettin' out of the darkness
My light shines on
My light shines on
My light shines on
I was lost, now I'm found
I believe in you, I've got no bounds
I was lost, now I'm found
I believe in you, I got no bounds
I'm movin' on up now
Gettin' out of the darkness
My light shines on
My light shines on
My light shines on (My light shines on)
My light shines on (My light shines on)
My light shines on (My light shines on)
(My light shines on)
(My light shines on)
(My light shines on)
(My light shines on)
Talatata I'm movin' on up now
Gettin' out of the darkness
My light shines on
My light shines on
My light shines on
I'm getting outta darkness
My light shines on
I'm getting outta darkness
My light shines on...
