Help, I have done it again
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And the worst part is
There's no one else to blame

Be my friend
Hold me, wrap me up
Unfold me
I am small, I'm needy
Wrap me up
And breath me

Ouch, I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
I think that I might break
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe

Be my friend
Hold me, wrap me up
Unfold me
I am small, I'm needy
Wrap me up
And breathe me
And breathe me.
