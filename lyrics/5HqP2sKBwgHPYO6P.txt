I live the life above
Hold me down
Hold me down
I live the life of lettin' go
Under a starlit night
I rap myself in thin sheet of ice
I've had the start of crystallize

Find me in the backyard
Find me in the backyard
In the dark
Find me in the backyard
Find me in the backyard

Cuz you colour me clear
Now what you, what you waitin' for?
Yeah you colour me clear
Now what are you waitin' for?

See how my mind is tired
From blue to black
From white to gray
I'm burned the broken one
The drops illuminate and evaporate into a neon lake
I'ma be stand the vicious one

Find me in the backyard
Find me in the backyard
In the dark
Find me in the backyard
Find me in the backyard

Cuz you colour me clear
Now what you, what you waitin' for?
Yeah you colour me clear
Now what are you waitin' for?
Cuz you colour me clear
Now what you, what you waitin' for?
Yeah you colour me clear
Now what are you waitin' for?
