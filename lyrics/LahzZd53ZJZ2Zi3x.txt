Everybody dance, when you dance, when you wanna dance
When you wanna dance, you will get in a trance
Everybody sees, what they see, what they wanna see
Everyone believes what they never have seen
Come with me, let's go, where we trace back the lies that show
You will never know unless you come with me, let's go
Everybody dance, when you dance, when you wanna dance
When you start to dance, you will get in a trance

All of our lives we put up a fight
Our heroes have died
All of our lives we've known wrong from right
Our people survived

Everyone get high, there's no need to justify
Everyone get high, there's no need to justify
We will occupy and we all know the reasons why
We will occupy and we drink tea 'til we die
Knowing something true absolutely unbearable
Knowing something true that will change the world I know
Everyone get high, there's no need to justify
Everyone get high, there's no need to justify

All of our lives we put up a fight
Our heroes have died
All of our lives we've known wrong from right
Our people survived

All of our lives, all of our lives
All of our lives
All of our lives we did what was right
Our soul will survive

We are the people who were kicked out of history
We are the people who exist in victory

You will deny, we will verify
How long can you run?
You will deny, we will verify
So it shall be done

Everybody dance, when you dance, when you wanna dance
When you start to dance, you will get in a trance
Everyone get high, there's no need to justify
Everyone get high, there's no need to justify

All of our lives we put up a fight
Our heroes have died
All of our lives we've known wrong from right
Our people survived

All of our lives, all of our lives
All of our lives
All of our lives we've put up a fight
Survived genocide, survived genocide

Everybody dance, when you dance, when you wanna dance
When you start to dance, you will get in a trance
Everyone get high, there's no need to justify
Everyone get high, there's no need to justify
