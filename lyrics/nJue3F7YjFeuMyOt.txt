Cynicism in the face of love I'm insecure
Stigmatism in the chase for worth I need more
Left right brain attitude
Memories on the floor
'Cause we all made do for the clear cutted
Red tape and the medial gauze put out for less
This passion to cover my flaws and pass the rest
And we strike gold in mysterious ways
Sometines we all gotta be cold blooded

Yeaah been fuckin around
But if I couldn't handle this crown
How would you make good on your word to my face
Sold in the back of my mind
High praise we takin our time
It's worth every minute of mine
In this space

So we stay up
My head's all good but my body's in shambles
No pay cuts
To the love of my life yeah I wish I was stable

Show worth every day of my life I'm Burning out
Cold calls in the name of this price without a doubt
I stay humble in the words that I'm given
'Cause there's nothing else I can do
Yeah I'm Type A but you gotta B right I must be lost
I'm on the same shit but you wanna impress at any cost
But we strike gold in mysterious ways
Sometimes we all gotta be cold blooded

Yeaah been fuckin around
But if I couldn't handle this crown
How would you make good on your word to my face
Sold in the back of my mind
High praise we takin our time
It's worth every minute of mine
In this space

So we stay up
My head's all good but my body's in shambles
No pay cuts
To the love of my life yeah I wish I was stable

My head's all good but my body's in shambles
No pay cuts
To the love of my life yeah I wish I was stable

My head, my head, my head
