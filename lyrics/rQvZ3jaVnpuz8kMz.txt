The devil's own
Why?

Where did I go wrong?
Who was I supposed to be?
No matter what I've done
You've always criticized me

Where did I go wrong?
Who was I supposed to be?
When it's said and done
Will you remember?

Slap on the wrist, smack in the face
The family tree
Gave me a name and nothing more
Neglected seed, why?

It's because of you I'm broken
It's because of you I'm dead inside

I never asked to be here
It's because of you I'm godforsaken
I never wanted this
It's because of you I'm dead inside

Where did I go wrong?
Who was I supposed to be?
No matter what I've done
You've always criticized me

What did I do wrong?
What was I supposed to be?
When it? s said and done
Will you remember me?

A happy home, a fairy tale
A broken dream
Gave me a life then turned away
Killed everything, why?

It's because of you I'm broken
It's because of you I'm dead inside

I never asked to be here
It's because of you I'm godforsaken
I never wanted this
It's because of you I'm dead inside
I've died, fuck

Father, bastard, I'm the devil's very own
Mother, know not just who I've become
Father, hate me for being all you're not
Mother's baby, I hate what I've become
I hate what I've become
I hate what I've become
It's because of you I'm broken
It's because of you I'm dead inside
Where did I go wrong?
Who was I supposed to be?
No matter what I've done
You've always criticized me
What did I do wrong?
What was I supposed to be?
When it's said and done
Will you remember me?
