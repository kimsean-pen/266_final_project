Take my hand lets lose some sleep.
Stop me fooling inbetween A (???) of all the girls I meet.
Show me personality.
Lets make some bruises I can show never let my head hang low never let me feel alone love me 'till our hearts explode.
I don't wanna go home I just wanna get lost I wanna get lost forever.
I wanna get lost with you.
I wanna get lost with you.
I don't wanna grow up I wanna get lost.
I wanna get lost forever.
I wanna get lost with you.
I wanna get lost with you.
Take me places I dont know.
I'm a post teenwreck of flesh and bones.
Stop my endless loosing streak my confidence waa always weak.
Lets get high all afternoon.
Chase our shadow 'round the room.
Change our actions change our names.
Never feel the same again.
I don't wanna get home I just wanna get lost I wanna get lost forever.
I wanna get lost with you.
I wanna get lost with you.
I don't wanna grow up.
I just wanna get lost.
I wanna get lost forever.
I wanna get lost with you.
I wanna get lost with you.
Lost, we're lost forever, Lost, lost forever.
Lost we're lost forever.
Lost they'll be lost for words.
