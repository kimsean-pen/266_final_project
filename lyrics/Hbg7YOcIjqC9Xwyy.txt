I dream of the winter in my heart turning to spring
While the ice gives way
Under my feet
And so I drown with the Sun
I've been burning in water and drowning in flame
To prove you wrong and scare you away
I admit my defeat and walk back home
Your heart
Under the rose
I open my eyes with a sigh of relief
As the warmth of summer sunlight dances around me
And I see you with the dead leaves in your hands
I've been been burning in water and drowning in flame
To prove you wrong and scare you away
I admit my defeat and walk back home
Your heart
Under the rose
I've been been burning in water and drowning in flame
To prove you wrong and scare you away
I admit my defeat and walk back home
Your heart
Under the rose
Burning in water and drowning in flame
To prove you wrong and scare you away
I admit my defeat and walk back home
Your heart
Under the rose
Your heart
Under the rose
