Molina, where you goin' to?
Molina, where you goin' to?

She's daughter to the mayor
Messin' with the sheriff
Drivin' in a blue car
She don't need no red light

Molina, where you goin' to? Lord
Molina, where you goin' to?

She's comin' in the mornin'
Lookin' a disaster
Drivin' in the prowl car
Spent the night in jail

Molina, where you goin' to? Lord
Molina, where you goin' to?

Whoa

Sheriff gonna go far
Drivin' to the state house
If she makes a million
Papa can retire
Molina, where you goin' to? Lord
Molina, where you goin' to? Lord
Molina, where you goin' to?
Molina, hey, where you goin' to?
