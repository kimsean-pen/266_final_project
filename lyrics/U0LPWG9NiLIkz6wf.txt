I am the cavalry captain
I am the remedy to your heart
I am the common collective
I am imprinted upon your stars

And when you shine
Shine your eyes
Looking lost
Looking bright
We'll away on the light brigade
And if only for a second
If only for a time
And if only for a second
And if only for a time
We'll be alive
We'll be alive

I am the cavalry captain
I am the remedy to your heart
I am the common collective
I am imprinted upon your stars

There is a world
There is a time
Looking calm
Looking kind
We'll away at the break of day
And if only for a second
And of only for a time
And if only for a second
And if only for a time
We'll be alive
We'll be alive

I am the cavalry captain
I am the remedy to your heart
I am the common collective
I am imprinted upon your stars
