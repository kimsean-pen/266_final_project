I give you this you give it back
I tossed a coin right on the track
Is this for real or is it wack
I get the feeling the feeling trapped

Something for nothing, yeah

And it doesn't matter where I live
After a while I wanna split
You specialize in twice as nice
I fall asleep but not at night

Something for nothing, yeah

What I know
I march in my own parade
I don't know
It's all just utter pain
I don't care
I plan out my escape
I don't know
What else can I say?

Yeah less is more, I know the tale
But what if it feels like you have doubt?
Could it be in your head or in your home?
Ain't it nice to know you're not alone?

Something for nothing, yeah

What I know
I march in my own parade
I don't know
It's all just utter pain
I don't care
I plan out my escape
I don't know
Oh what else I can say

Oh Angeline, is this the only way?
Oh Angeline, I think you're likely to stay
Oh Angeline, I'm not the only one
Los Angeles, you got that hot burning sun

Whoa!

Something for nothing, yeah

What I know
I march in my own parade
I don't know
It's all just utter pain
I don't care
I plan out my escape
I don't know

What I know
I march in my own parade
I don't know
It's all just utter pain
I don't care
I plan out my escape
I don't know
What else can I say?
