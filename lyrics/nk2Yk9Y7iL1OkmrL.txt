We did what we could
To save this house from falling
But it burns because it's wood
And now you'll never call me darling

I coughed your name
I smoked all day
And I slept myself sleepy
I was sleeping it away

Don't let it burn
Don't get confused
Don't let it get to you

We did what we could
To save this car from crashing
Your pretty face is soaked in blood
You know, I still find you dashing

Airbag suffocates
You need a little space
The rain on the windshield
I watched you limp away

Doesn't it have to hurt?
Don't get confused
Don't let it bother you
Don't try to call
You'll lose it all
You get used to her bad news,

It's just bad news
