Went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said, "Son, do you feel kind of warm?"
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said, "You're in love, love"

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
Said when the next one arrives
Be looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
Next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me lies

I'm running back down to that woman
Mad as I could be
Told her I didn't see nobody
That she made a fool out of me

Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love
