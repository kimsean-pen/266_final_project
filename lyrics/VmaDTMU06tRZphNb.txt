Happy Holidays

Oh, yeah!
We've been waiting all year for this night
When the snow is glist'ning on the trees outside
All the stockings are hung by the fireside
Waiting for Santa to arrive
And all the love will show
'Cause everybody knows it's Christmas time
And all the kids will see
The gifts under the tree
It's the best time of year for the family

It's a wonderful feeling
Feel the love in the room from the floor to the ceiling
It's that time of year
Christmas time is here
And with the blessings from above
God sends you His love
And everything's OK
Merry Christmas
