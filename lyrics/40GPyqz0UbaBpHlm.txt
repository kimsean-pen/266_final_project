Sweet Mami Wata whispers songs of the good life
Sits in a field and sews a quilt under moonlight
The pink sky, the blue of the night, and blackberry becomes the rain
Sweet Mami Wata whispers songs of the good life

Name all your reasons she turns them to ribbons that take flight
The voice in your head turns to wind rustling leaves on a cool night
Your heart thaws you look at the sky, and soon as your eyes start to rain
Your humming along while she whispers songs of the good life.
The pink sky, the blue of the night, and blackberry becomes the rain
Sweet Mami Wata whispers songs of the good life
The pink sky, the blue of the night, and blackberry becomes the rain
Sweet Mami Wata whispers songs of the good life

Ooooh
