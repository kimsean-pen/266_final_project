Dancing in your party dress
You were singing
me some Frank Sinatra as you wept
Pull me close enough
It seems like we lost touch so hold me as the record skips

Maybe I'm just too good
Maybe I'll run away
Maybe I'm over you
Maybe I shouldn't stay
Maybe I just don't care
Maybe I talk too much
But baby I'll be there
Yeah, baby I'll be there
It's been a little hard
I've been a little tough
But maybe all along
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid

Champagne for dinner
I'm swaying from side to side
Too much to think tonight
She said "I hope that we're worth saving
Sometimes you will hate me, but that's alright"

Maybe I'm just too good
Maybe I'll run away
Maybe I'm over you
Maybe I shouldn't stay
Maybe I just don't care
Maybe I talk too much
But baby I'll be there
Yeah, baby I'll be there
It's been a little hard
I've been a little tough
But maybe all along
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid

Maybe all we are is fools with hearts that tried too hard
And maybe that's just fine as long as you're here in my arms

Dancing in your party dress
You were singing me some Frank Sinatra as you wept

Maybe I'm just too good
Maybe I'll run away
Maybe I'm over you
Maybe I shouldn't stay
Maybe I just don't care
Maybe I talk too much
But baby I'll be there
Yeah, baby I'll be there
It's been a little hard
I've been a little tough
But maybe all along
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid

I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
