Left your heart behind when I laid eyes and said I'm up and done
The young just live and don't look back or wait for anyone

And baby, you loved me, but I just up and wanted to run
Back and forth, behind and down, when you were in and I was out
Me chasing lovers in the front line of the parking lot
And baby, I loved you, but I was not done having my fun

Played around with your heart
Now I'm playing around in the dark (Ooh)
Played around with your heart
Now I'm paying while we're apart (Ooh, yeah)
Played around with your heart (Played around with your heart)
Guess I played myself from the start (Ooh)
Played around with your heart

Where, oh where's the man that landed in my hands when I'd say fall?
I pushed you head over my heels until I pushed too far

And baby, I need you, but you just don't want nothing at all
Back and forth behind and down when you were in and I was out
We chasing lovers in the front line of the parking lot
And baby, I'd tell you, but you wont give the number to call

I played around with your heart
Now I'm laying around in the dark (Ooh)
Played around with your heart
Now I'm paying while we're apart (Ooh, yeah)
Played around with your heart (Played around with your heart)
Guess I played myself from the start (Ooh)
Played around with your heart

I want you back (You back)
I've been playing around with your heart too long, whoo
And now, I played around and got caught
And now, I played myself and got lost

Oh baby, I played around with your heart
And now, I'm playing around in the dark (Ooh)
Played around with your heart
Now I'm paying while we're apart (Ooh, yeah)
Oh, baby, now I played around with your heart (Played around with your heart)
I guess I played myself from the start (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Played around with your heart
