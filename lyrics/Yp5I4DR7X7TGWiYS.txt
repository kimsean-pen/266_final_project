I remember when, when I first moved here
A long time ago
'Cause I'd heard some song I used to hear back then
A long time ago

I remember when, even further back
In another town
'Cause I saw something written I used to say back then
Hard to comprehend

And the question is, was I more alive then than I am now?
I happily have to disagree
I laugh more often now, I cry more often now
I am more me

But of course some days I just lie around
And hardly exist
And can't tell apart what I'm eating
From my hand or my wrist

'Cause flesh is flesh, flesh as flesh as flesh
The difference is thin
But life has a certain ability of breathing new life into me
So I breathe it in

It says here we are and we all are here
And you still can make sense
If you just show up and present an honest face
Instead of that grin

And the question is, was I more alive then than I am now?
I happily have to disagree
I laugh more often now, I cry more often now
I am more me

And the other day, this new friend of mine
Said something to me
just because something start diferently

does not mean it worth less
And I soaked it in, how I soaked it in
How I soaked it in
And just as to prove how right he was

Then you came
So I'm gonna give, yes I'm gonna give
I'm gonna give you a try
So I'm gonna give, yes I'm gonna give
I'm gonna give you a try
And the question is, was I more alive then than I am now?
I happily have to disagree
I laugh more often now, I cry more often now
I am more me
