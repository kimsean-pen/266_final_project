There is a roadway
Muddy and foxgloved
Never I'd have life enough
My heart is screamin' out
And in a few days
I would be there, love
Ever here that's left in
Me is yours just as it was

Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark, the light, the flame

Eyes at the heights of my baby
Let's hope at the fight of my baby
The lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved

And tell me if somehow
Some of it remained
How long you would wait for me?
How long I've been away
The shape that I'm in now
You're shaping the doorway
Make your good love known to me
Just tell me about your day

Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark, the light, the shame

Eyes at the heights of my baby
And this hope at the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved
And the sights were as stark as my baby
And the cold cut as sharp as my baby
And the nights were as dark as my baby
Half as beautiful too
