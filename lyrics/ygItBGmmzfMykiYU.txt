Burning
I step into the sun
And it stills me
The traces of your love
What have I become
Lost inside a memory
Buried deep inside of me
Never
Breaking
I'm escaping
Lost inside a memory
Can't erase the enemy
Never
Breaking
I'm escaping
Learning
The meaning of the life
And it haunts me
Would you run into my mind
And left my heart so blind
Lost inside a memory
Buried deep inside of me
Never
Breaking
I'm escaping
Lost inside a memory
Can't erase the enemy
Never
Breaking
I'm escaping
NOW!!!
NO ONE'S HELPING ME
Lost inside a memory
Buried deep inside of me
Never
Breaking
I'm escaping
Lost inside a memory
Can't erase the enemy
Never
Breaking
I'm escaping
NO!!!!
