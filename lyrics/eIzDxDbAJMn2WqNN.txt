Got a brain fart

Sunday driving always felt so lonesome
It never rains here, it's dead anyways
And I can't stand the thought of rotting right here
So maybe driving keeps you saved

Are you tired of waiting on some air to breath?
Are you tired of me?
Are you tired of waiting, or are you tired of me?
Baby set me free
D'you got a car?
D'you got a set of keys?

Tell me where you're going. Is there room for me?
You got a car
You got an empty seat
Take me driving bloody somewhere, set me free
D'you got a car?

My bedroom walls are feeling more like prison
So shallow sleep and bloodshot eyes
Someone save me from these sad, sad poems
Let's run away on up I-5

Are you tired of waiting on some air to breath?
Are you tired of me?
Are you tired of waiting or are you tired of me?
Come on set me free

D'you got a car?
D'you got a set of keys?
Tell me where you're going, is there room for me?
D'you got a car?
D'you got an empty seat
Taking me driving bloody somewhere, set me free

West End driveway
Oakland save me
Lift this curse of being seventeen
Gilman smoke house
Fox hole smoked out
Anywhere is fine, if we run free

D'you got a car
D'you got a set of keys
Tell me where you're going, is there room for me
D'you got a car

D'you got a set of keys
Tell me where you're going, is there room for me
You got a car
You got an empty seat
Taking me driving bloody murder, set me free

D'you got a car?!
D'you got a set of keys?!
Tell me where you're going! Is there room for me?!
D'you got a car?!

D'you got an empty seat?!
Take me driving bloody somewhere, don't leave me!
D'you got a car?
