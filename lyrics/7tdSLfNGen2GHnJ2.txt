(La la la la la la
La la la la la la la)
Running through the streets
(?)
So i don't worry 'bout nothing
(I don't worry' bout nothing)
See i don't worry 'bout nothing
Lady don't go
I think it's time you should know
It's not the way you should go
(La la la la la la la)

Cause you'll never be
The one i want you to be
Cause i know that person is me

Running through the streets
(?)
So i don't worry about nothing
(I don't worry about nothing)
La la la la la la
