Some days are long and some days are old
I was dragging my feet across the broken hall
I remember sad faces in the mirror by me
In a song goes blank faces in the drivers seat
You know I spent a million tears tryina pick myself up on these years
And I ended whole... now
Nor call you... comes the tears you rain down
You call me later than the ...that end
Used to cry no tears... cry no tears
Some days are long and some days are old
I was dragging my feet across the broken one
I remember sad faces in the mirror by me
In a song goes blank faces in the drivers seat
You know I spent a million tears tryina pick myself up on these years
And I ended whole... now
Nor call you... comes the tears you rain down
You call me later than the ...that end
Used to cry no tears... cry no tears
Again, again, uh, again
Used to cry no tears... cry no tears
Again, again, uh, again.
