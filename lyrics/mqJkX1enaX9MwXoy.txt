I just quit this joke of a life plan
It won't get me nowhere, no
I'm a fear driven service robot
A spectacle of a man with no options

No further will I travel aimlessly
Along this fool's errand
No longer be a victim of me

Complain about everything in my life
And blame everybody I know
I make every decision laced in panic
Regrettable, but I know it's amendable

No further will I travel aimlessly
Along this fool's errand
No longer be a victim of me

I don't have to run from me
Just turn away
And be satisfied
I'm not going to fight with me
Just turn away
And stop wandering aimlessly
Yeah I'm not going to choose to be
A victim of me
I'm not going to let myself be
A victim of me
