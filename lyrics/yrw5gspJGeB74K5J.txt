Sweet thing, I watch you
Burn so fast it scares me
My game, please don't leave me
Come so far, don't lose me
It matters where you are

As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With her cool things and her Heaven
Hey, hey lover, you're still burning
You're his song yeah
(Hey, hey)

Sweet thing, I watch you
Burn so fast it scares me
My game, don't lose me
Come so far don't lose me
It matters where you are

As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With her cool things and her Heaven
Hey, hey lover, you're still burning
You're his song yeah
(Hey, hey)

Sweet thing I watch you
(Burn away)
Sweet thing I watch you
(Burn away)
Sweet thing I watch you
(Burn away)
