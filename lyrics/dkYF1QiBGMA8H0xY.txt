Well I was movin' at the speed of sound
Head spinnin' couldn't find my way around and
Didn't know that I was goin' down
Yeah, yeah
Where I been, well its all a blur
What I was lookin' for, I'm not sure
Too late and didn't see it comin'
Yeah, yeah

Then I crashed into you
And I went up in flames
Could've been the death of me
But then you breathed your breath in me
Then I crashed into you
Like a runaway train
You will consume me
But, I can't walk away

Some how I couldn't stop myself
Just wanted to know how it felt
Too strong I couldn't hold on
Yeah, Yeah
Now I'm just tryin' to make some sense
Out of how and why this happened
Where we're headed, there's just no knowin'
Yeah, yeah

And then I crashed into you
And I went up in flames
Could've been the death of me
But then you breathed your breath in me
Then I crashed into you
Like a runaway train
You will consume me
But, I can't walk away

From your face, your eyes
Are burned into me
You saved me, you gave me
Just what I need
Oh, just what I need

And then I crashed into you
And I went up in flames
Could've been the death of me
But then you breathed your breath in me
Then I crashed into you
Like a runaway train
You will consume me
But, I can't walk away

Then I crashed into you (x5)
Like a runaway train
You will consume me
But I can't walk away, yeah
