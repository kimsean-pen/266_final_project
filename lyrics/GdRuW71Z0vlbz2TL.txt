These great fields are stretching,
Taking me oh so far
Great fields are stretching,
Savannah stretching oh so far

And this dry air is taking
My girl and it's oh so hard
And i wish i had a melody for a songbird to sing back my love

Oh my savannah,
Did it have to be so hard?
Oh my savannah,
Taking all my love and all my heart

Tailor won't you make me
The finest suit so dark and black and grey
And old john won't you lend me
The finest gun your eyes have ever laid

The fastest bullet flying,
So quick nobody ever feel no pain
'Cause the plains they took my baby
And i'm gonna take her to the funeral beds to lay

And oh my savannah,
Did it have to be so hard?
Oh my savannah,
Taking all my love and all my heart

Oh no no ...x3

And i'm struggling, and I'm stumbling,
And i need to start
I'm struggling, and i'm stumbling
I need you in my heart

Tailor won't you make me
The finest suit so dark and black and grey
And old john won't you lend me
The finest gun your eyes have ever laid

The fastest bullet flying,
So quick nobody ever feel no pain
'Cause the plains they took my baby
And i'm gonna take her to the funeral beds to lay

I hate to say i love you,
But oh goddamn i love you,
You know i do
But you're gone away, gone away, gone away

These great fields are stretching,
Taking me oh so far
