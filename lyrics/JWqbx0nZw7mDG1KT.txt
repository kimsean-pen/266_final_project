I'm here to curse my own tongue again
For it's wrong again
Untrue

Oh I'm the only one, they noticed it[?]
Hung over it, seem to

(Be) falling from my mouth before I move
Not helping any point I'm trying to prove
Just smiling there, darling in the end

I wish I didn't care,
'Cause caring is rude

I'm here to curse my own name again
Make it plain again
For you

Do you really think that if I could change,
The world could change, that's not true

'Cause you are young and we don't share a soul
And nothing I could say would gain control
Oh nature rushing me back to the cell
It's better for my health –

If I hold it true[?],
'Cause caring is rude

You are young and we don't share a goal
And nothing I could say would gain control
Oh nature rushing me back to the cell
It's better for my health –

If I hold it true[?],
'Cause caring is rude
Nature is cruel
