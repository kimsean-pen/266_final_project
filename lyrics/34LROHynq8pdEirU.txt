In a jar of alchemy
The sands of mind washed in from the sea on a sinking boat
Navigating the tangled thread
In a snag at the edge of the bed a well-worn plot
Written in an aching need
The book with the shining seed could not float

I awoke in the early morning
I thought to tell you something
But I forget what it was now anyway
It's good of you to stay

I saw myself in shattered mirrors
Each an echo of the other's features, but never the same
The pieces hung on to the wall
Held a while before they fall from the game
But if they could resolve
To flow as they dissolve my name

I awoke in the early morning
I thought to tell you something
But I forget what it was now anyway
It's good of you to stay

I had a dream, beautiful
In a garden there grew shining trees
Fruit and vines in the night
The plants there shone a strange light from their leaves
I drew closer to the colored shapes
Illuminating the folds of my cape and my sleeves
And of a sudden heard a sound
Buzzing soft all around without a breeze
Flying in the garden where
Flowers touched my hands and hair thousands of bees
I awoke in the early morning
I thought to tell you something
But I forget what it was now anyway
It's good of you to stay
