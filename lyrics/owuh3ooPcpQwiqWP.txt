Send applause to your heart strings
Send it
Send it all down

May they strum and feel everything
Another minute passed
Another year I dread
May they strum and feel everything
May they strum and feel everything
Letters will help you
Spring a farewell

Don't doubt your alphabet
Don't doubt your alphabet

There's always anniversaries for moments we refuse belief
And I
And I can't tell you
How much it hurts to be reminded all the time

Swallow oxygen
Expand and hold it in
All these years have passed
Yet it hurts to be reminded all the time
Applause my lungs, still breathing
Sometimes it's hard believing
Struggle with every single breath

I want to give up
I want to give up

We are the overcast that refused to pass
Every afternoon when the sun left
We are the overcast
Please take me back
I miss the twists
I miss the spins
All I have is the damage

Send applause to your heart strings
Send it
Send it all
I wanna give up

Swallow oxygen
Expand and hold it in
All these years have passed
Yet it hurts to be reminded all the time
Applause my lungs, still breathing
Sometimes it's hard believing
Struggle with every single breath
It hurts to be reminded
I want to give up

Send applause
Send it
