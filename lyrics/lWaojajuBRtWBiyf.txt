Crawled away from me
Slipped away from me
Tried to keep a hold
But there was nothing I could say

Slid away from me
Crept away from me
Tried to keep you down
But there was nothing I could say

What you tryin' to say
Is you don't want to play
What you want
And what you need
Don't mean that much to me
I can see your back is turning if I could I'd stick a knife in

Crawled away from me
Slipped away from me
Tried to keep a hold
But there was nothing I could say

Slid away from me
Drift away from me
Tried to keep you down
But there was nothing I could say

What you tryin' to say
Is you don't want to play
What you want
And what you need
Don't mean that much to me
I can see your back is turning if I could I'd stick a knife in

This is love
This is love
This is my love for you
This is my love for you
This is my love for you
This is my love for you
This is my love for you
This is my love

Say you won't go
Get up
Say say
Get up
Say

Get you in a strangle hold
Get it, get it, get it

What you tryin' to say
Is you don't want to play
What you want and what you need
Don't make a fuck to me

I can see your back is turning if I could I'd stick a knife in
