I was never one to
Stick around the same town
Staring out the window
Getaway car when you're gonna come around
I'm a phoenix blazing down the freeway
Hand out the window
No sleep cause the streets don't sleep when you're dreaming

I just want the world to have one more
C'mon crooked stars don't you want to line up?
I think I found a crack in the glass ceiling
Gonna break it down with this steel pipe dream
Gonna break it down

I am an astronaut
A renegade
Tearing through the dark on a new wave
It's ride or die since I know
I'm gonna burn it up, up, up oh
I am the underdog, team juggernaut
Drinking in line to catch a bus
It's ride or die since I know
I'm gonna burn it up, up, up oh

I was never one who
Fell into a straight line
Always cutting corners
Trouble maker on a golden state high
I'm a phoenix burning up the airways
Coming through your speakers, back beat with the nasally west coast flavor

I just want the world to have one more
C'mon crooked stars don't you want to line up?
I think I found a crack in the glass ceiling
Gonna break it down with this steel pipe dream
Gonna break it down

I am an astronaut
A renegade
Tearing through the dark on a new wave
It's ride or die since I know
I'm gonna burn it up, up, up oh
I am the underdog, team juggernaut
Drinking in line to catch a bus
It's ride or die since I know
I'm gonna burn it up, up, up oh

I'm burning up, up, up
Burning up, up, up
No sleep cause the streets don't sleep when you
No sleep cause the streets don't sleep when you
Blazing down the freeway
Hand out the window

I am an astronaut
I am a renegade
Burning up, up, up
Burning up, up, up
I am an astronaut
A renegade
Tearing through the dark on a new wave
It's ride or die since I know
I'm gonna burn it up, up, up oh
I am the underdog, team juggernaut
Drinking in line to catch a bus
It's ride or die since I know
I'm gonna burn it up, up, up oh
