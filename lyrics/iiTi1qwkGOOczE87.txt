Every morning after
I'm the same disaster
Every time it's groundhog day
Tell me, have you moved on?
Am I just a sad song playing every night and day?

Say can you read between the lines I'm singing
Threw away the only chance I had with you
Maybe you'll always be the one I'm missing
All I've got left are the words that you said

Stay with me tonight
I want you to stay with me tonight

Got me on a bender
I'm the great pretender
Putting on a masquerade
But when the party's over
Lonely, getting sober
Yeah, you got me wide awake

Say can you read between the lines I'm singing
Threw away the only chance I had with you
Maybe you'll always be the one I'm missing
All I've got left are the words that you said

Stay with me tonight
I want you to stay with me tonight

She said, "Don't walk away
Leave what we could be behind
Don't leave me standing here
Don't say 'not the time', so
Stay with me tonight"

Can we go back, do it over?
Can we go back to the start?

Say can you read between the lines, I'm singing
(Read between the lines, I'm singing)

Stay with me tonight
I want you to stay with me tonight

She said, "Don't walk away
Leave what we could be behind
Don't leave me standing here
Don't say 'not the time', so
Stay with me tonight"

Every morning after
I'm the same disaster
Every time it's groundhog day
