I'm alive
I feel your heartbeat
Moon in your mouth
We are perfection
Life and desire
I wanna stay here now
Every moment is a luxury

Just pull me along
And don't let go
You started something

I'm alive
I feel the blood
Seeing stars in your eyes
There is an endless
Chill, that's the love

So, hold me love
And don't let go
We started something
We're alive

We're looking at the Moon
It's the same face we all see

To you, to you
Alive, to love
To you, to you
Alive, to love
