I feel the void cause I'm on a mission
I have no hero, I just have a vision
To liberate and destroy your system
The game is over, the game is over

I'm over it now, abusing the crowd
I'm willing to die to see your fall
Power abound, I'm taking you down
I'm willing to die to see your fall

I'm a threat to the opposition
I have no hero, I just have a vision
To terminate and restore this kingdom
The game is over, the game is over

I'm over it now, abusing the crowd
I'm willing to die to see your fall
Power abound, I'm taking you down
I'm willing to die to see your fall

All I see while I'm dreaming
Is a man I wanna destroy
There is no use for you hiding
I will beat [?] every door

Are you prepared for the fighting
Cause I'm rising up, suffered up
I gave up on you long ago

I'm over it now, abusing the crowd
I'm willing to die to see your fall
Power abound, I'm taking you down
I'm willing to die to see your fall

Over it now, abusing the crowd
I'm willing to die to see your fall
Over it now, abusing the crowd
I'm willing to die to see your fall
