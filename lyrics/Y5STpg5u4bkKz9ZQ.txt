Perfection
Natalia Kills

The subject seems obsessively concerned with power,
Having control.
Suffering from neurotic impulses.
Experiencing feelings of extreme satisfaction,
And disappointment within limits.
Possible fantasist.
Extremely volatile. Opinionated.
Self sentimental.
Suffering from daddy issues. Denial
Suffering from over-discipline and a lack of control.
But not to worry.
Just take two of these with perfection,
And everything will be fine in the morning.
