This world's a fucking nightmare
It brings us nothing but pain
Chasing dreams that don't exist
And everything's not what it seems
Try and draw me off my path
Look what's become of me
Can't deny the damage I've caused
Gotta balance my reality

Destroy your fucking world
It brings us nothing but pain
Hardened wills, force fed lies
Resistance, return to strength
Return to strength

Ill tempers fill my mind
I've grown through this pain
Hard pressed to desperation
Too late for apologies

Destroy your fucking world
It brings us nothing but pain
Hardened wills, force fed lies
Resistance, return to strength

Destroy your fucking world
I've grown through this pain
Hardened wills, force fed lies
Resistance, return to...
Strength

I put the worst behind me
Crossed out what I no longer need
Life isn't always fair
Back to the essence as I prepare to

Destroy your fucking world
It brings us nothing but pain
Hardened wills, force fed lies
Resistance, return to strength
I've grown through this pain
I've grown through this pain
Too late for apologies
Resistance, return to strength
Return to strength
