So long brothers, I have seen enough
I have seen it tear apart, and break away the trust
So long brothers, I have said enough
I have seen the best of us
Go down and won't come up
The best of us, go down and won't come up
The best of us, go down and won't come up

I should know now
I have stayed too long, I have seen the best of us
Fly high and hit the Sun
So long brothers, I have said too much
I have seen the best of us
Go down and won't come up
