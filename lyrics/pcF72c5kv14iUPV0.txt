Everyday I'm awake I almost die, when I was a kid three fucking times
I guess it's true what they say, I won't save me
Reality dances with my eyes, dilate my own state of mind
I guess it's true what they say, I wont save me

'Cause we tripped and we tripped until our brains fell in a ditch
And we never found a fix
'Cause we don't exist

Are you mad now that i'm too far gone?
Are you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone?

The fountain of youth's now running dry
Ascend the clouds to testify
You know it's true what they say, I'm too in love with the trip

And we tripped until our brains fell in a ditch
And we never found a fix 'cause we don't exist

Are you mad now that i'm too far gone?
Are you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone?
You can try to keep up now, but you do it all wrong somehow
You're so mad that you can't be like me, too far gone

And we tripped and we tripped until our brains fell in a ditch
And we'll never fucking find the fix

Are you mad, are you mad now that i'm too far gone?
Are you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone
You can try to keep up now, but you do it all wrong somehow
Are you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone?

Are you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone?
Are you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone?
Are you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone?
Are you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone?
