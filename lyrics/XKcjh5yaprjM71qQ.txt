Sick Again

From the window of a rented limousine,
I caught your pretty blue eyes.
One day soon you're gonna' reach sixteen,
Painted lady in the city of lies.

Ooh, do you, know my name?
Do I, look the same?
You know I'm the one you want, baby,
I must be the one you need, yeah!

Clutchin' pages from your teenage dream,
In the lobby of the Hotel Paradise.
Through the circus of the L.A. queens,
How fast you learn the downhill slide.

Oh, how you, play the game.
Still don't, know your name.
You know I'm the one you want, baby,
Whooh, yes, I got to be the one you need, need, need, need,
yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah.

Oh, you got to tell me.

Just a minute, just a minute.
Lips like cherries, and the brow of a queen,
Come on, flash across your eyes.
Said you dug me since you were thirteen,
Then you giggle as you heav an' sigh.

Ooh, do 'ya, know my name,
Do I, look the same?
Baby, I got to tell you, I'm the one you want,
And everybody knows I'm the one you need, yeah-yeah.

Oh, get it, get it
Come on now
Come on now
Come on now

Hours, hours, with the moments in between,
Oh, baby, how the time flies? I couldn't count the times,
The thought of comin', and the pain in leavin'.
Oh, baby, dry those silver eyes

Oh, do you, know my name?

Do I, look the same?
You know I'm the one you want,
Whoo-ooh, ye-yes, I'm the one you need, yeah-yeah!

Ooh, that's right!
Ooh, yeah, that's right!
Ooh, that's right!
That's right.
That's right.
Oooh, yeah, that's right.
That's right.
Aoaoh, aoaoh, aoaoh, aoaoh, aoaoh...
