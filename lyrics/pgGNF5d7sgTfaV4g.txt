Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin'
Can't hear your mama call

From the early, early mornin' till the early, early night
When you caught Miss Molly rockin' at the House Of Blue Lights

Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like a ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin'
Can't hear your mama call

Momma, pappa told me "Son, you better watch your step
If I knew my pappa, momma, have to watch my pappa myself"

Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call

Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call

I am going to the corner going to buy a diamond ring
Would you pardon me kiss me make me ting-a-ling-a-ling

Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call
