You've been holding back for a lifetime
Without even knowing why you're so afraid every day

Break down your walls - Let them see
The faces of your enemy
And your struggle to break free
Your struggle

Let all your feelings flow freely but don't get emotional
I'm not going to let you go
There is nothing in this world that can keep me from loving you
I support everything you do
I support everything you do

Keeping up appearances for the crowd
But you're living your life - deadly alive
Are you dead or alive?
Are you dead or alive?

Let all your feelings flow freely but don't get emotional
I'm not going to let you go
There is nothing in this world that can keep me from loving you
I support everything you do
I support everything you do

Break down, break your walls
I'm gonna break down your walls
Break down, break your walls
You've got to break down your walls
I'm gonna break down your walls

Let all your feelings flow freely but don't get emotional
I'm not going to let you go
Let all your feelings flow freely but don't get emotional
I'm not going to let you go
There is nothing in this world that can keep me from loving you
I support everything you do
Break down, break your walls
I'm gonna break down your walls
Break down, break your walls
I'm gonna break down your walls
I'm gonna break down your walls
