My opinion can change today.
I'm responsible anyway.
Second to third-hand information
complicates the complication.
I don't think before I speak,
and I don't know how far my words reach.
So wrong nearly every time
that I'm sorry I speak my mind
if what I said was unkind.

Now it feels like I'm on fire.
It's burning the world through.
Don't hold it against me
'cause I know you're lying too.

Is there any need for apologies?
There's no reason to believe me.
Judgements born in my jealous mind
creeping inside outside.
Connections I've made never follow through
and sooner or later disappoint you.
I'll cross you twice when your back is turned.
That's how I've learned
that someone has got to be burned.

Now it feels like I'm on fire.
These words are not the truth.
Don't hold it against me
'cause I know you're lying too.

It feels like I'm on fire
It's burning the world through.
Don't let me fall
without someone to hold on to.
Someone to hold on to.
Someone to hold on to.
