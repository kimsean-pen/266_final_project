Can we love each other
and respect each other
find some joy together
that's all i need
all, all i need
that's all i need
all, all i need
i don't want your money
or your time
just a heart that's beating
with mine
that's all i need
all, all i need
that's all i need
all, all i need
here
and when you've got to look
on your shoulders
you'll see i'll be there for you
like you'll be there for me
cause that's all i need
all, all i need
that's all i need
all, all i need
that's all i need
all, all i need
all, all i need
all i need
that's all i need
i need
so simple
we can move
we can just give it up
give it up, give it up
feel heart now that you're all i need
all i need
all i need
i feel ...
