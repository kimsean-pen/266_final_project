Tired of playin' this game
And I won't play it no more
And I won't take it no more,
Uh
Through with being your fool
And I won't do it no more
And I won't,
I won't keep up this act
Not for one minute
I'm gonna pull,
I'm gonna pull this curtain down, oh

This time I won't play this game
I made a vow to make a change and
I (mm)
Bow out (I won't be hangin' around baby)
I decline to take the pain and
I resign the masquerade and
I (I)
Bow out (I won't be stayin' around baby)
I (I)
Bow (I bow)
Out

Can't go on with the show
You're just a stage I went through
Now you're just fadin' from view, yeah-yeah babe
It's time for a change of scene
Guess I'll be takin' my leave
I guess I won't,
I won't stay in this play
Not for one minute
I'm gonna make,
I'm gonna make my exit now, oh baby

This time I won't play this game (this time I won't)
I made a vow to make a change and (I made a vow)
I (I)
Bow out (I won't be hangin' around baby)
I decline to take the pain (I decline)
I resign the masquerade and (oh yeah)
I bow out (I won't be stayin' around baby)
I (oh)
Bow (ooh)
Out (out!)

When you're left standin' on that stage all alone
Maybe you will realize
You should've learned to treat me right
And when this final act is finally through
Maybe you'll have wished you'd been
The kind of man you should have been
Now watch me say goodbye
And walk right out of your life
Ooh baby,
Alright baby

This time I won't play this game (this time)
I made a vow to make a change and (this time I made up my mind)
I (I)
Bow (I bow)
Out (I won't be hangin' around baby)
I decline to take the pain and (I decline boy)
I resign the masquerade and (no more, said I)
I bow (gonna bow out)
Out (I won't be stayin' around baby)
This time I won't play this game
I made a vow to make a change and
I (said I)
Bow (gotta)
Out (I gotta bow out)
(do you believe me?) I decline to take the pain and
(I say, can a you here me?) I resign the masquerade and
(do you here me baby?) I bow (mm)
Out (I won't be stayin' around baby)
This time I won't play this game
I made a vow to make a change and
I (I)
Bow (bow)
Out (ooh, baby, I bow out!)
I decline to take the pain and (I said I bow out!)
I resign the masquerade and
I bow out...
