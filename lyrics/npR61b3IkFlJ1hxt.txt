On your guard as you lurk along the sand
A paper face won't mask your fear
Unrelenting consequences for this inquisition
Venture forth and give yourself away with the scent of unfamiliarity

For razor teeth love their human silk
They long to savor unexpecting flesh
To drink a carcass dry is to taste the Sunderban

Mighty one, never forget, never forget why your skin is thick
Die defending that which your heart keeps closest

The taste of vengeance is so much sweeter on the blackest of lips
The wind whispers trespass, a call for an end
Take up your arms, set your sights

Take up your arms, set your sights
Never fear, there's always more blood
Retaliate, retaliate, retaliate

At ease mighty one, this war is not one of your own

The king returns to claim his throne
A humble crown adorns his noble brow
As the killing season comes to a close
Take what's left and start again
Take what's left and start again

As you strive to regain all aspects of your grief ridden life
As you strive to regain all aspects
Living each day with strength found in your heart
