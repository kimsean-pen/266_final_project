What do you get when you fall in love?
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
That's what you get for all your trouble
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

What do you get when you kiss a guy?
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do, he'll never phone ya
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

Don't' tell me what's it's all about
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
Out of the chains, the chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lies and pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

Dont' tell me what's it's all about
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
Out of the chains, the chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

What do you get when you give your heart?
You get it all broken up and battered
That's what you get, a heart that's shattered
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again
