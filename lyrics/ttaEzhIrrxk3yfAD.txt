I was born a fighter
I was born on a rainy day
Ive had my share of pain
But youve missed most of that
So many other things you had to do
You looked after you
Do you remember what u did
Did you know what youve just missed
Do you care about that word i have to say?

You took my innocence away and never had a chance to
You broke me in with your mistakes and thanks for the break through
But you wont bring me down
I always am around
You took my innoncence away but the best of me stayed

It could be your blood running through all my vains
That ties me to your fame
If i could just close my eyes
Id blackout all the reasons why
Were still in this place
What u want is what u got
You should have dragged to make it stop
I quess you couldnt find a way to let me earn

You took my innocence away and never had a chance to
You broke me in with your mistakes and thanks for the break through
But you wont bring me down
I always come around
You took my innoncence away but the best of me stayed

Lonelyness have filled my sole
And it kreeps inside it takes control
And i dont know how to begin giving up on everything

You took my innocence away and never had a chance to
You broke me in with your mistakes and thanks for the break through
But you wont bring me down
I always am around
You took my innoncence away but the best of me stayed
