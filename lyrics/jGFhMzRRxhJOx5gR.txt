I heard the time just slips from your sugarplum lips
So I go there to watch it fall
And my jaw just drops when your cherry lolly pops
I get nervous when you bounce my ball

I get the strangest sense we were lovers' past tense
Like a dog in heat I can't be indiscreet
And when I see you there I whisper my prayer so sweet
I'm getting shaky on my feet
I'm incomplete

I'll be you one man band, be at your command
Just say the word and I'll be your renaissance man
I swear I'll go where you don't dare
I'll bury this affair deep down in Sugartown

I heard your glass hips swayed while the jitterbugs played
Every man was on his bended knee
All my hopes got smashed as my nerve just crashed
I was as heavy as a boy could be

I get the strangest sense, we were lovers' past tense
Like a dog in heat I can't be indiscreet
And when I see you there I whisper my prayer so sweet
I'm getting shaky on my feet
I'm incomplete

If you just can't do me right
Honey please do me wrong

I'll be your one man band, be at your command
Just say the word and I'll be your renaissance man
I swear I'll go where you don't dare
I'll bury this affair deep down in Sugartown

And if you just can't do me right
Honey please do me wrong

I'll be your one man band, be at your command
Just say the word and I'll be your renaissance man
I swear I'll go where you don't dare
I'll bury this affair deep down in Sugartown
Deep down in Sugartown
Deep down in Sugartown
Deep down in Sugartown
