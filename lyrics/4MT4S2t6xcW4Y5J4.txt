hold the reins inside
hold it inside
these horses they pull me
these horses they pull me
these tires they pull me
these winds they push me
these wires they pull me
these wires they pull me
to you
these horses they pull me
these horses they pull me
these tires they pull me
on the unforgiving roads that lead to you
these winds these winds they push me
these wires these wires they pull me
these wires these wires they pull me
to you
and nobody can stop me now
