I'm coming up out of the dark
Take out the bullets from my heart
You are my favorite mistake
The one I cave loving to make
Craving, I'm cravin, I crave you!
Waiting, I'm waiting to touch you!

Whenever, forever I know that
Still I'm coming back
Bittersweet, baby!
Summertime, save me!

Party day hazy!
Oh, baby!
Craving, I'm cravin, I crave you!
Bittersweet, baby!
Save me in the summertime!
Party day hazy!
Oh, baby!
Craving, I'm cravin, I crave...

You...
You...
Come on, buddy we'll figure it out
Know what my trigger's are about
Craving, I'm cravin, I crave you!
Waiting, I'm waiting to touch you!
Whenever, forever I know that
Still I'm coming back
Bittersweet, baby!
Summertime, save me!

Party day hazy!
Oh, baby!

Craving, I'm cravin, I crave you!
Bittersweet, baby!
Save me in the summertime!
Party day hazy!

Oh, baby!
Craving, I'm cravin, I crave...
(Oh, baby...!)
A bittersweet, baby!
Summertime, save me!
Party day hazy!
Oh, baby!
Craving, I'm cravin, I crave you!
Bittersweet, baby!
Save me in the summertime!
Holiday hazy!
Oh, baby!
Craving, I'm cravin, I crave...
You.
