No more time
Just one more time

So crazy, beat the strain
Too lazy, shake the gray
So, and she willed the rain
So let me be defamed
Your redundancy stains
Tired of infantile claims
Like puppets on their strings
Untangle you from me

Time to call the doggies off
Tired of the shadowin'
Slide me to the side again
Slapped in the face again

No more time
Just one more time

Your redundancy stains
Tired of infantile claims
Live puppets on a string
Untangle you from me

So crazy, beat the strain
Too lazy, shake the gray
So, and she willed the rain
So let me be defamed

Time to call the doggies off
Tired of the shadowin'
Slide me to the side again
Slapped in the face again

One day my plane leaves
Some way my head creeps
Some day my head leads
Some way my head creeps

No more time
Just one more time

Empty room sets the scene
Pick at me slow, pain fiend
Suck me through barbed screen
Anger becomes our Queen

Tounge whipping forked black
How long until you crack
Surprised and set back
Lackey's loose talk for fact

Time to call the doggies off
Tired of the shadowin'
Slide me to the side again
Slapped in the face again

Time to call the doggies off
Tired of the shadowin'
Slide me to the side again
Slapped in the face again

One day my plane leaves
Some way my head creeps
Some day my way leads
Some way my head creeps

No more time
Just one more time

So crazy feel the hate
Yeah, I got years to wait
I know it's not to late
Lending clean hands to fate
Rise from the dirt, I'm in
Hide in anothers skin
Stick black dress doll with pin
Your mouth takes on my grin
