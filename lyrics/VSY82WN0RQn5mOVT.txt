Beauty so grandeur
Voice like the wind
That carries from afar
Flawless appearance
But shattered within
Her wings tear the sky above

Into the dark and the
Everlasting night
Into the welkin
She draws the stars

With frosty hands she guards a broken crown
Skin cold and white as snow
Her eyes like the deepest waters

Raven hair is dancing with the storm
That brought the frozen rain
She is the gale of winter

Pristine in grace
All that's fragile is concealed
Strength of a legion
Might that compares
With forces of nature

Into the dark and the
Everlasting night
Into the welkin
She draws the stars
