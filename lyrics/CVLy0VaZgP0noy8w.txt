...in my zone, I close my fakers up
All your hoes chose me, nigga calm down

Louis pouch across my body, this is not for fashion
This is not a playground, ain't no fist fight bitch I'm blastin'
Niggas say they looking for me, like I'm not right here man
If I tatted tears, I'd be crying to my beard man
Bitch I'm trying to fuck, I've been inside for thirteen years now
I've been on so many flights, it's like my record's clear now
A.K.A. the man, A.K.A. I never ran
Don't make me turn this red light on your head like you Roxanne

Only talk to bosses, not the second in command
Niggas bring it, talk to me, you better have a plan
'Cause they don't have a cure for all my pain
A.K.A. it's Not Nice and I live up to my name (Ya Ya)

Diss The Boy, are you insane?
I drink Henny when I shoot my pistol at the range
That way when I'm tipsy, I still know I got my aim
A.K.A. it's Not Nice and it's not a fucking game (Ya Ya)
You and I, we're not the same
Posted like Ibaka, got your wifey runnin' brains
She was there with boi dem kicked my front door off the frame
She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Trap trap, trappin' in the rain
She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Just know I'm a shooter first and rap is not my thing
A.K.A. it's Not Nice and I live up to myâ€“

Hiding in the racks
I don't pay tax, 12 on my back
Might drive the Caddy around, but I never lack
Baka not with the shit, so yeah who tellin' you that?
I went to jail and then they released Men in Black
When I came out, Timberlake was bringing Sexy Back
Facts, nigga facts
I fell in love with my strap
Named my son "Milli" 'cause I want a milli' to stack (Ya Ya)
Now run and tell that
You niggas moving like the cops, don't make me pepper your block
Out the window while the whip's moving, that's a hell of a shot
Fuck all my opps, I'll put you niggas on FOX (Ya Ya)

Diss The Boy, are you insane?
I drink Henny when I shoot my pistol at the range
That way when I'm tipsy, I still know I got my aim
A.K.A. it's Not Nice and I live up to my
