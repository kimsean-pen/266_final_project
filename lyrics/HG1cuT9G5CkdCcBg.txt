We slept in NYC, and ate in California.
Made friends in Bolton warren, and then got sun burned in florida.
so we moved to michigan, west sorta.
but moaned the long last night, warm romantic down in georgia.
home, home, home, home, is where you stop for a minute,
and clean your teeth.

we left our pet behind, took a bus to cleveland.
should've never left that cat, miss him much this evening.
But you gotta'move on, soon comes another season.
An i know its hard some times when you gots to find a reason.
Home, home, home, home, is where you stop, for a minute.
home, home, is where you stop, for a minute, for a minute.
home, home, is where you stop, for a minute, and clean your teeth.
