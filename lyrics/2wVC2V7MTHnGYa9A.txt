Show me that you're human, you won't break

Like a thief in the light, you can't hide, you can't hide from your shadow
It's the only thing you own
And you don't need to pretend that perfection is your friend
'Cause we're all broken

We all end up alone

Show me that you're human, you won't break
Oh, love your flaws and live for your mistakes
Beauty's on the surface wearing thin
Come closer, show the marks upon your skin
Show me that you're human

Show me that you're human

You're a spark without flame
I'm a desert in the rain
You're a mountain and I'm a stepping stone
So walk away from your pride
It's a demon in disguise
And it won't help you to calm the swelling tide

Show me that you're human, you won't break
Oh, love your flaws and live for your mistakes
Beauty's on the surface wearing thin
Come closer, show the marks upon your skin
Show me that you're human

Show me that you're human

Show me that you're human, you won't break
Oh, love your flaws and live for your mistakes
Beauty's on the surface wearing thin
Come closer, show the marks upon your skin

Show me that you're human, you won't break
Oh, love your flaws and live for your mistakes
Beauty's on the surface wearing thin
Come closer, show the marks upon your skin
Show me that you're human
