He's got the most immaculate haircut
but with the right dye and shampoo
maybe I could too
and he's got the most desirable friendship group
but boy when you got that hairdo
they're not gonna call you

Now we got to get together
and make some amends
I see the girls falling for you
oh she must adore you
woah, woah, woah...

I get this feeling in my bones sometimes its like
my legs might fall away
a shooting pain runs down my left hand side and I
I think of you,
oh hush now

Don't have a baby look at what you gave me
you can always grow you know
oh hush now

Don't have a baby look at what you gave me
we can always grow together

I get this feeling in my bones sometimes its like
my legs might fall away
a shooting pain runs down my left hand side and I
I think of you,
oh hush now

Don't have a baby look at what you gave me
you can always grow you know
oh hush now

Don't have a baby look at what you gave me
you can always grow you know
oh hush now

Oh hush now

Oh hush now

Oh hush now
