Take my life, I lay it down
At the cross, where I am found
All I have, I give to You, oh God

Take my hands, and make them clean
Keep my heart, in purity
That I may walk in all You have for me

Oh oh oh oh, here I stand, arms open wide
Oh oh oh oh, I am Your and You are mine

Jesus

Take my moments, and my days
Let each breath that I take
Be ever only for You, of God

Oh oh oh oh, here I stand, arms open wide
Oh oh oh oh, I am Yours and You are mine
Oh oh oh oh, here I stand, arms open wide
Oh oh oh oh, I am Yours and You are mine

Oh oh oh oh

My whole life is Yours, I give it all
Surrendered to Your name
And forever I will pray
Have your way
Have Your way

My whole life is Yours, I give it all
Surrendered to Your name
And forever I will pray
Have your way
Have Your way

Oh oh oh oh, here I stand, arms open wide
Oh oh oh oh, I am Yours and You are mine
Oh oh oh oh, here I stand, arms open wide
Oh oh oh oh, I am Yours and You are mine

Oh oh oh oh, here I stand, arms open wide
Oh oh oh oh, I am Yours and You are mine

My whole life is Yours, I give it all
Surrendered to Your name
And forever I will pray
Have your way
Have Your way

My whole life is Yours, I give it all
Surrendered to Your name
And forever I will pray
Have your way
Have Your way
