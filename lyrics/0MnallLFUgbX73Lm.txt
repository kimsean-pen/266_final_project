Do you love me?
Oh, do you love me?
I say so
Do you need me?
Oh, do you need me?
God, I hope
I got this feeling deep inside
That somewhere, somehow
You'll pass me by
I can't put my finger on it, but
The more that I see you
The more that I know

Everywhere you look
Is everywhere I've been
You finish all my sentences before they begin
And I know
That look in your eyes
It's like I've seen you before
About a million times
In another life, in another life maybe
In another life
You must have been been mine

You make me feel so
Oh, you make me feel so
Beautiful
It doesn't matter
No, it never matters
If we're out or home
We can make hours into years
Wherever you go you're always here
It's like I've known you from before
But I'm just so happy you walked through my door

Everywhere you look
Is everywhere I've been
You finish all my sentences before they begin
And I know
That look in your eyes
It's like I've seen you before
About a million times
In another life, in another life maybe
In another life
You must have been been mine

I'm breathing you in
I'm breathing you out
You're all around me
No matter what we do
I wanna spend my life with you
Only you

Do you love me
Oh, Do you love me?
Say you love me
Oh, say you love me

Everywhere you look
Is everywhere I've been
You finish all my sentences before they begin
And I know
That look in your eyes
It's like I've seen you before
About a million times
In another life, in another life maybe
In another life
You must have been been mine

And I know that look in your eyes
It's like I've seen you before
About a million times
In another life, In another life maybe
In another life, You must have been mine

Do you love me?
Oh, Say you love me...
