Then dawn came and I stayed and was laughing with you
The smoke love then I dove and was kissing with you
My past erase as we lay in a daze
Please say nothing of yesterdays

I'm gonna sleep
I'm gonna sleep under the stars until the end
Till your touch say time will it begin
I'm gonna love until the bitter end

Working days get in my way as I'm thinking of you
Smoke love, keep dreaming of when I was kissing with you
Please say nothing of yesterdays
My past erase as we lay in a daze

I'm gonna sleep
I'm gonna sleep under the stars until the end
Till your touch say time will it begin
I'm gonna love until the bitter end

I'm gonna sleep
I'm gonna sleep under the stars until the end
Till your touch say time will it begin
I'm gonna love until the bitter end
