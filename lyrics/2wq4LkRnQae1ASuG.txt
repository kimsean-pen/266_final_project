She found the records
Lying underneath the bed
All the songs she used to sing
All the songs she used to play
All those words, those melodies
And the promise of some kind of love
And the promise of some kind of love

When we lose what we love
Don't think anything
Will ever taste the same
When we lose what we love
Don't think anything will
Ever feel as good again
Now I know how much the anger
However much the pain
Destroy only enough that
Enough still remains of
Some kind of love,
Some kind of love
Some kind of love
Some kind of love,
Some kind of love
Some kind of love

The songs hadn't changed,
Every note just the same
But when she played them once again
All those words, those melodies
Like better days past and gone,
Leaving her behind
With the promise of some kind of love
With the promise of some kind of love

When we lose what we love
Don't think anything
Will ever taste the same
When we lose what we love
Don't think anything
Will ever feel as good again
Now I know how much the anger
However much the pain
Destroy only enough
That enough still remains of
Some kind of love,
Some kind of love
Some kind of love
Some kind of love,
Some kind of love
Some kind of love
Some kind of love

She put the records back in their place
And straightened her dress,
And wiped her face
She closed and locked the door
And left them lying on the floor
And she sang

Mmmm, some kind of love
Some kind of love, mmmm
Mmmm, some kind of love
Some kind of love, mmmm
Mmmm, some kind of love
Some kind of love
