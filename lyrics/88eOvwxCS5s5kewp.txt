I miss missing you
I miss missing you

Where's the pain when you walk out the door?
It doesn't hurt like it used to before
Where's the love that we couldn't ignore?
It doesn't kick like a pill anymore

Where's the thrill at the end of our fights?
Where's the heat when we turn out the light?
I just miss all the mess that we made
When we still had the passion to hate

I miss missing you sometimes
I miss hurting you 'til you cry
I miss watching you as you try
Try not to end up in tears

Begging to get back together
I just want you to bleed
To be stuck in that second forever
So don't freak out if I leave

Sometimes I'm just missing, missing you
I miss missing you

There's a dark cloud pulling me in
That's the girl I was bathing in sin
There's a blind force letting it win
And it's longing to tear us apart

I get high when you're making me weak
Let me down 'til I crawl on my knee's
I just miss all the mess that we made
When we still had the passion to hate

I miss missing you sometimes
I miss hurting you 'til you cry
I miss watching you as you try
Try not to end up in tear's

Begging to get back together
I just want you to bleed
To be stuck in that second forever
So don't freak out if I leave

Sometimes I'm just missing missing you
I miss missing you

Miss-missing, miss-missing, miss-missing
(I wanna crush in your arms at the other side of the world)
Miss-missing, miss-missing, miss-missing
(I wanna die for you 'cause love is only true if it hurts)

I miss missing you sometimes
I miss hurting you 'til you cry
I miss watching you as you try
Try not to end up in tears

Begging to get back together
I just want you to bleed
To be stuck in this second forever
So don't freak out if I leave

Sometimes I'm just missing, I'm missing
Missing you, no, missing you
I miss missing you
