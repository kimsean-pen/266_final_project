Just because you packing out here lax fam you ain't 2Pac
Granny keep a loaded 45 right inside the glove box
Brandon shot his first keystone 'fore he could spell his last name
Jr learned to load from uncle Charlie at the card game
Kelly lit her school up like it's 4th of July
Where she from them 22s more patriotic than pie
New year shoot up the sky
Shooters boot up and ride
Popos show up and fire
Know there's nowhere to hide

They hollerin give me back my bullets
Lynyrd Skynyrd new Van Zants
If you own it then you'll pull it
Maybe so. Probably not
They spend billions like civilians won't catch trickle from the top
Just to protect or to progress what but little bit we got
Bruh bruh
I'm your friendly neighbor
I stay on yo block
I protect and service
I big game buckshot
Ain't no cracking that code ain't no safety on locks
Might as well get you one
Procrastinating will get you popped
