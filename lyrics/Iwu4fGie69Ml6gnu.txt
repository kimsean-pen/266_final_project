Well I tripped, I fell down naked
Well I scratched my knees, they bled
Sew up my eyes, need no more
In our game there is no score

Forgive me father, why should you bother?
Try honesty, try honesty
Hop in your dumptruck, reverse for good luck
Ride over me, ride over me
Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls
Die tragedy, die tragedy
Call me a cheapskate, come on for pete's sake
Cry agony, cry agony

I'm insane, it's your fault, so sly
Your well of lies ran dry
And I cut the cord, free fall
From so high we seem so small

Forgive me father, why should you bother?
Try honesty, try honesty
Hop in your dumptruck, reverse for good luck
Ride over me, ride over me
Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls
Die tragedy, die tragedy
Call me a cheapskate, come on for pete's sake
Cry agony, cry agony

I talk to you
I'm insane, it's your fault
Cry

I'm insane, it's your fault
Cry

I'm insane, it's your fault
Cry
Forgive me father, why should you bother now?
Forgive me father, why should you bother now?
Forgive me father, why should you bother?
Try honesty, try honesty
Hop in your dumptruck, reverse for good luck
Ride over me, ride over me
Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls
Die tragedy, die tragedy
Call me a cheapskate, come on for pete's sake
Cry agony, cry agony
Cry agony, cry agony
Try honesty, try honesty
Cry agony, cry agony
