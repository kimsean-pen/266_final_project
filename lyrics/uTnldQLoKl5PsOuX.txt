You are a sight for aching eyes
A river for my thirst
When all the world is harsh and dry
Wasted by the curse
All words seem beggardly and poor
Then set to sing your grace
What could I've know of love before
My eyes had seen your face

My love how beautiful you are
My love is ever where you are

I know you fear the wounds of time
The wondering feet of crows
But I am yours and you are mine
And none but me could know
How all of you enraptures me
'Til I can look away
I pray that I will live to see
You wear a crown of gray

My love how beautiful you are
My love is ever where you are

And when you kiss me I am lost, or is it that I'm found?
My feet send roots beneath the rocks
To fix me to the ground never to float away again
A captive to the tide
No more to wonder in the wind without you by my side

My love how beautiful you are
My love is ever where you are
