None of this matters, none of these words
Common and silent we will die in this world
We've only spoken to those who agree
And without them we've fallen on deaf ears

Stand on conviction
And you will walk alone

For once I have stood (I have stood)
No one will know
But alone I was born
And alone we must go

In my convictions
I've found my own grave
But amongst the dead we all fade away

Yet solitude is better than a life
Not worthy of reaction
There is nothing to lose (nothing)
So we stand alone or join those who follow in misery

In my convictions
I've found my own grave
But amongst the dead we all fade away
In my convictions
I've found my own grave
But amongst the dead we all fade away
Fade away

Stand on conviction
And you'll walk alone
A voice is only a noise
Without someone to hear
And without a crowd to feed
That noise grows silent

For once I have stood (I have stood)
No one will know
But alone I was born
And alone we must go

Fading back into an anodyne sea
To drown with all whove gone before me

We must go

In my convictions
I've found my own grave (my own grave)
But amongst the dead we all fade away
In my convictions (convictions)
I've found my own grave
But amongst the dead we all fade away

Stand on conviction and you'll walk alone
Fading back into an anodyne sea
To drown with all
Who've gone before me

Fading back (fading)
Fading back into an anodyne sea
Fading back (fading)
Fading back, fading away
