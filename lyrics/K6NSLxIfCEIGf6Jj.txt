Scared of losing touch
If I really mean that much
Why pretend that you love him?
Don't call me out the blue
When it's clear that I still do
And you know he knows it too.
Going home alone
The only love I've known
It's always been you.

It's always been you.

Tell me it's not real
Tell me he doesn't make you feel
The way I made you feel.

If you care for me at all
You'll hang up when I call
You'll clear me the space to fall.
If you give I will receive
And despite what they believe
It's always been you.

It's always been you.

It's always been you.

When you're feeling alone
And you're colder than stone
Call me you know
It's always been you.
