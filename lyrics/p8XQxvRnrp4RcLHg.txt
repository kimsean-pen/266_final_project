Sometimes when I watch you
You seem like the same person that I once knew
And watch from a distance
But never able to do more than I ever would
Looking at you
I find again I am starving in your mystery
So far away and some kind of helplessness

And then I remember
That I know you love me, I know you do

Sometimes when I
I listen to your fearless voice, it's the voice I once heard
I want to know you
And understand you more than I fear I do
To keep the wonder
The moment you seem like a stranger to my heart and me
And all I want
In an instant I see you perfected again
Though you'd never change
Please remember when you ever think of me
