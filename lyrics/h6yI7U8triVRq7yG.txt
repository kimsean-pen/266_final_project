The angels of hatred, the engine that scream through the sky
As visions of crosses and graves fuel lifeless eyes
Desolation of hope and the death of one's prayers
The tarnished cage of goodwill is beyond repair

Heart of darkness
Remorse has fallen away
Not of this world
For God is not here today

The coldness that sets in the air as the ice fills the veins
Disorder and chaos overthrowing the house of the sane
Desolation of hope and the death of one's prayers
The tarnished cage of goodwill is beyond repair

Heart of darkness
Remorse has fallen away
Not of this world
For God is not here today

Desolation of hope and the death of one's prayers
The tarnished cage of goodwill is beyond repair

Heart of darkness
Remorse has fallen away
Not of this world
For God is not here today
