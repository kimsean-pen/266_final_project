Rather be a bandit than a lover
I'd rather be a man with the other
To run the mountain down, run it down

Rather be a whisper in heaven
Than a daughter locked in your prison
So run the mountain down, run it down

You are airborne, you've got silver rays
Will it ever float? Will it ever soar along?
You are airborne, you've got silver rays
Will it ever float? Will it ever soar along?

Grip the crown like winner
Pretending like a beginner
So run the mountain down, run it down

You are airborne, you've got silver rays
Will it ever float? Will it ever soar along?
You are airborne, you've got silver rays
Will it ever float? Will it ever soar along?

All for the feather, did it all for your feathered hand
Will it ever float? Will it ever soar along?
All for the feather, did it all for your feathered hand
Will it ever float? Will it ever soar along?
