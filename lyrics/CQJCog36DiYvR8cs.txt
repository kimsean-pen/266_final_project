They told me "boy, look the other way"
Told me "boy, bite your tongue"
'Cause that's not the way
Yeah, that's not the way

Oh, that's just not the way that friends behave
Oh, that's just not the way that friends behave
Oh no, no, no
No, no, no, no

You light me up across the room
Two falling sparks, one willing fool
And I, I always knew that I would love you from afar

Told me "boy, look the other way"
Told me "boy, hide those hands"
Well I've been living on the crumbs of your love
And I'm starving now

And that is just the way that we remain
Oh, that will be the way that we remain
Oh no, no, no
No, no, no, no

You light me up across the room
Two falling sparks, one willing fool
And I, I always knew that I would love you from afar

You light me up across the room
Two falling sparks, one willing fool
And I, I always knew that I would love you from afar

It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
It shouldn't come as a surprise
You got darling hazel eyes

It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
