The wind changed the first day that you came through
Cut the corn, washed it clean
Now everything that's ever gone before is like a blur
And it's all because of you

& now I find this city's like a stranger to me
I once was fooled by Cadillacs and honey
And no one feels like you
Not like you

Not like you
Not like you, no
'Cause even though the flower fades
Something takes its place

A marching band on a sunny day
Two pretty eyes or a a pretty face
In the forest I made my home
Lay down on hard and ancient stone
And if my heart should somehow stop

I'll hang on to the hope that you're not too late
That you're not too late
And there are times I know when I will have to chase you
The further from my side you go the longing grows

And I will hate this, but I'll still want you
Yes, I will hate it, but I'll still want you now
Even though the flower dies
Somethings by it's side

A helping hand or a kiss goodbye
To ease it on it's way
In the forest I made my home
Lay down on hard and ancient stone
And if my heart should somehow stop

I'll hang on to the hope that you're not too late, yeah, yeah, yeah
Not too late, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
In the forest I made my home
Lay down on hard and ancient stone
If my heart should somehow stop
I'll hang on to the hope that you're not too late
That you're not too late
