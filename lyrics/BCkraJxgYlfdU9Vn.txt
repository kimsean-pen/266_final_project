My baby and I
We live out West
Where the air is so sweet it'll burn a hole in your chest
My baby and I
Are from back East
But not so far back East
That you can call it the East
My sweet, my sweet Midwest
My, my, my sweet, my sweet Midwest

Know my baby and I
Gave it a go
Tried to plant some seeds, but they would not grow
The road is the road
Takes you where you wanna go
And home is home
Home is home is home
My sweet, my sweet Midwest
My sweet, my sweet Midwest
My my my my my sweet, my sweet Midwest
My sweet, my sweet Midwest

My sweet, my sweet Midwest
My sweet, my sweet Midwest
My my my my my sweet, my sweet Midwest
My sweet, my sweet Midwest
