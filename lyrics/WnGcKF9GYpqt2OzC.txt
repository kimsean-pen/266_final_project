Don't say goodbye to me too fast
Even though I'm fast asleep
Try your best to hold onto the past
Wasted it on all me

They chase us around all the hallways
Sometimes I swear that I see
Know that I'm hear for you always
Ghosts of you and me

Wasted it all on me, ohhhhhh

I know you got hands of stone
And I know you got hands of stone
Crush everything I've ever known
Including my bones, when you left home for the unknown

Ohhhhhhh
