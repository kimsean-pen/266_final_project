Look who's talking now
Look who's talking now
Look who's talking now

Me know a pop star, we call him Mr X
He has a very, very complex attitude
He said some nasty things about I and I
He even said some nasty things about everyone
Me no like the way him chat, I say
Me no like the way him go
That's why me said to him:

Look who is talking
Look who's talking now
Look who's talking now
Look who's talking now
Look who's talking now
Look who is talking
Look who is talking
Look who is talking
Look who is talking

Come to mor and he said that he's the best
He is very critical and complaining all the time
Everyone is wrong, he's the one that is right
This striking pop star would not even give up
He's an opportunist with one hit song
That's why me said to him:

Look who is talking
Look who's talking now
Look who's talking now
Look who's talking now
Look who's talking now
Look who is talking
Look who is talking
Look who is talking
Look who is talking
Look who's talking now
Look who's talking now
Look who's talking now
Look who's talking now
Look who is talking
Look who is talking
Look who is talking
Look who is talking
