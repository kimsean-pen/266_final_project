I'm willing to try this
But maybe you're not (Maybe you're not)
Maybe we'll like it
Let's give it a shot

But let's throw ourselves in
And get soaking wet
Don't just slip our toes in
Not yet

Don't tell me that you're kind of into me
'Cause I just wanna be, wanna be, wanna be
Adored!
I need to feel it, to know that you mean it

From the bottom of your soul
Let me know that I'm adored
It's not enough for you simply to say it
Instead of telling me words and let me know

That your positively mine and
I'm positively yours for sure (For sure)
From the bottom of your heart
Let me know I'm adored

I'm willing to show you
The thoughts in my mind (My mind)
I'm willing to cut loose
The ropes that I tied

So tell me you're ready
To dig in the dirt
To show me the places
Where you haven't heared

Don't tell me that you're kind of into me
'Cause I just wanna be, wanna beeeee
Adored
I need to feel it, to know that you mean it

From the bottom of your soul
Let me know that I'm adored (Adored)
It's not enough for you simply to say it
Instead of telling me words and let me know

That your positively mine and
I'm positively yours for sure (For sure)
From the bottom of your heart
Let me know that I'm adored

What's the point that suddenly your less
(from the bottom of my heart)
What more wanna win and not for second best
(from the bottom of my heart)

So shattered my heart don't matter now
because I wanna fall
for my own sickness don't matter if I break
you're gonna be adored, by me

Don't tell me that you're kind of into me
'Cause I just wanna be, wanna be, wanna be...
Adored!
I need to feel it, to know that you mean it
From the bottom of your soul
Let me know I'm adored (Adored)
It's not enough for you simply to say it
Instead of telling me words and let me know
That your positively mine and
I'm positively yours for sure (For sure)
From the bottom of your heart
Let me know that I'm adored
From the bottom of my heart
From the bottom of my heart
From the bottom of my heart
From the bottom of my heart
Because
From the bottom of my heart
From the bottom of my heart
From the bottom of my heart
From the bottom of my heart
Because
