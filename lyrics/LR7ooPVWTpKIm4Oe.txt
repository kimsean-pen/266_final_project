You set it up, you set it right,
it's fair enough. al'right:
if i want a loan, if i wanna trespass.
why should i walk when you've got wheels.
when i'm in doubt, when i'm in debt,
when i'm in deep at your expense.
then i owe you. i owe you. i owe.

i'd never make you suffer, i know that wouldn't do,
and that ain't practical, and i ain't through.
when what i got needs fixing, when i want something new,
i know i'm covered with you. your're my human interest...
