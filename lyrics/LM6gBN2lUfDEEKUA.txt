By the look on your face
You've been awake all night
It started raining in the early light
You're fooling the mirror
But you don't fool me
A drift in your own sympathy

It's down falling apart
Don't stay too long in the dark
I long deep in the dark
Of your devotion
Let go the longer you stop
Let go you have to let go
Together back in control
Of your emotions

You can make it through tomorrow
Set free your butterfly girl
And when you rise above the sorrow
You be a butterfly girl

Now you're drunk in the dream of your life as dirt
It might last forever and that really hurts
And I still hope you're gonna realize
There's only one kind of happy in the glass of wine

It's down falling apart
Don't stay too long in the dark
I long deep in the dark
Of your devotion
Let go the longer you stop
Let go you have to let go
Together back in control
Of your emotions

You can make it through tomorrow
Set free your butterfly girl
And when you rise above the sorrow
You be a butterfly girl
