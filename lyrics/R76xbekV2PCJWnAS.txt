Sun came out this morning, not a care in the air today
BBQ cueing by the food, food
Couple cute girls on the way
Told her bring some friends wit em
Fucked around, blew a speaker but it's okay
Too hot for some pants, denim
Know they gon pull up in them shorts totally (oralé)
Beep beep
Who got the keys to my weed?
Who got the trees that I need?
Need some more fees for homies
Me amore gone for the weekend
Jodeci freek n you
Summer time sipping, got drank for you
No ring, but do got a thang for you
Kinda feen for you
Tipsy and turning up
I can't get enough

(CHORUS)
This goes out to the head nod that you get when the bass boomin'
Got 10's, 12's even got 20's for the sub, get ya movin
She don't wanna hear what you got playing in your whip
When you pull up she get mad
Thats too bad
It's a trip
And I
I know its getting late but you
can't keep blowing up the phone like this
I know it's getting late but you
can't keep blowing up the phone like this

(TIRON)
More than my woman, she's sort of my muse
It's more than her aura, she's sort of my fuse
It's more than her booty and boobs, body is beautiful tho
More than her hair, makeup and shoes making me move
She's more than rare
Regulars cool, poppin is cute
Not in her league
Goddess is key
She ain't common but listen to Common
In between prima donna and the King of Diamonds
Namasté, namastā
I'm addicted
Imma never get tired, I'm addicted
Like, 3-6-5 I'm addicted
If it don't hit then it ain't shit
It it ain't this, then it won't work
If it don't hurt (ow!)

So if she's a 10 then she can hop in my whip
And if she bringing a friend, then ima ask if she thick
And we gon party till sun up, she down for all the above

She'll hit you when she done
Cause the girl just wanna have fun
The girl just wanna have fun (uh)

(CHORUS)
This goes out to the head nod that you get when the bass boomin'
Got 10's, 12's even got 20's for the sub, get ya movin
She don't wanna hear what you got playing in your whip
When you pull up she get mad
Thats too bad
It's a trip
And I
I know its getting late but you
can't keep blowing up the phone like this
I know it's getting late but you
can't keep blowing up the phone like this
