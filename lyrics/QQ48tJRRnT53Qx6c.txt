Waldorf, naptown, worldwide
WHAT?

Come on, get up, get up, get up
Come on, yeah
...
Break it, break it down
Everything's going to be alright now
Everything's going to be alright
Get down, stay up all right now
Let's do this one more time
Everyday I'll be alright, alright

Bring it, bring it in what?

Bring in, the verse ahh
Listen up 'cause there ain't nothin' funny
I wanna hot girl and a little bit of money
I wanna little house where my band can live
'Cause we're tired of movin' every other weekend
I wanna go to parties where they got no guns

I wanna rock with my band I wanna have a little fun
Where thugs and punks and any other type

Can sing this song and we'll sing it all night, sing it
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright

Get down stay up all night now
Let's do this one more time
Everything'll be alright

Everything will be alright, alright
...
All I wanna do is kick the welfare
All I wanna do is get my share
All I wanna do is kick the welfare
All I wanna do is get my share
And I don't wanna run for the President
I just want an honest way to pay my rent
And I'm tired of the man always shuttin' us down
Tired of my old man 'cause he's never around
And I'm tired of eating off of other people's plates
And I don't look important so they're tellin' me to wait

Police records said they wouldn't exist
I wanna know the meaning of a Christmas list
Said all I wanna do is kick the welfare
All I wanna do is get my share

All I wanna do is make somethin' from nothin'

It's GC baby and we're workin' with somethin'
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
Get down stay up all night now

Let's do this one more time

Everything'll be alright
Everything will be alright, alright
...
We'll be self-made millionaires

...
These lives we'll lead without a care
...
Oh yeah
And we'll see what we'll be
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everybody say ah yeah that's right
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everybody say it one more time
Everything will be alright, alright
(Alright, alright, alright)
...
We'll see you when we get there
We'll see you when we get there
...
On the video
Or the radio
In the magazines
On the movie screens
