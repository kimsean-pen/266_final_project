Injected
Straight to the core
C.N. system bypassed
Ready for war
Targets now hostile
Pushed to the edge
These colours have borne - No retreat
Honour the pledge

Try to run - You cannot hide
Thoughts that cannot be denied
Pain that never goes away
The powder burns

Onward
No compromise
Proceeding ritual
Fear denied
Hopped up on dreamdust
Burns in the brain
Psychological technique
Invincible - No pain

Try to run - You cannot hide
Thoughts that cannot be denied
Pain that never goes away
Powder burns
