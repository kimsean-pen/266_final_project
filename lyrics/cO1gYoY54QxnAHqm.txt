Outside the gates of heaven
Oh, there lives a unicorn
I close my eyes to seven
Oh, this world is not my home
A broken heart in danger
And a pillar filled with tears
Oh, can you see the strangers?
In the pain and in the fears

Can you feel my heart?
Baby don't give up
Can you feel my love tonight?
In hundred years
Love is illegal
In hundred years from now
In hundred years
Love is illegal in this lonely, heartbreak town
In hundred years
Love is illegal
All your dreams will die
In hundred years
Love is illegal
And your hope will not survive

L.O.V.E.
Love is illegal my heart
Hear my heart is beating
L.O.V.E.
Love is illegal my heart
Hear my heart is beating

You're walking through a fire
Computers everywhere
Oh, you're a shotgun rider
Controllers here and there
And you read old love letters
Drowning in the sea
Oh, baby it doesn't matter
Oh, you've lost all what you feel

Can you feel my heart?
Baby don't give up
Can you feel my love tonight?
In hundred years
Love is illegal
In hundred years from now
In hundred years
Love is illegal in this lonely, heartbreak town
In hundred years
Love is illegal
All your dreams will die
In hundred years
Love is illegal
And your hope will not survive

L.O.V.E.
Love is illegal my heart
Hear my heart is beating
L.O.V.E.
Love is illegal my heart
Hear my heart is beating

Can you feel my heart?
Baby don't give up
Can you feel my love tonight?
In hundred years
Love is illegal
In hundred years from now
In hundred years
Love is illegal in this lonely, heartbreak town
In hundred years
Love is illegal
All your dreams will die
In hundred years
Love is illegal
And your hope will not survive.
