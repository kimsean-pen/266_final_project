I saw a pyre of black sunflowers
Trapped in a swarm of moths
And swallows crying heimve
Hovering on the storm
Soaring above the golden corn
So gracefully
And then a sadness gripped me
All shall pass
Our love corrupts
Turn to ghost, to dust

I saw a pyre of dreams
And my heart's decay in full bloom
I left my love behind
And my darkness was her groom
And from darkness we come
To darkness we grow
In darkness we call
In darkness through and through
Our love corrupts
Turn to ghost, to dust
