No sense in admitting I'm weary from the wait
No sense in pretending that
I'm pressing on the gate
No power in a promise that I can find the cause
All it takes are a few mistakes
So how can I be sure

What if I fall
What happens next
What if my foundation was a thought out of context
No power in a process that leaves me in the dark
So I'll just go with what I know
It's written on my heart

But though it's late in the day

I know I'll find my way soon
Show me a place in the sun
Cuz somewhere on the journey
It's the strength to go on
So let the dark fade
Show me a break in the cloud
Cuz every day I'm waiting
Brings me one degree down

No shame in admitting I feel a little scared
No sense in pretending that
I'll now before I'm there
No power in a promise with no authority
All it takes are a few mistakes before
I'm lost at sea

I know I'll find my way soon
Show me a place in the sun
Cuz somewhere on the journey
It's the strength to go on
So let the dark fade
Show me a break in the cloud
Cuz every day I'm waiting
Brings me one degree down

I feel this inclination
Leading me to doubt my destination
I used up all ma patience all the time
I waited at the station

I don't want to break my stride
I'm not going to come back down
I don't want to lose my ride
I'm too far gone to turn back now

I can't avoid the feeling maybe all the signs could be misleading
With all my senses reeling when I saw my dreams all hit the ceiling

No need for reflecting on why it took so long
No need for rejecting the road I'm walking on
No point reminiscing on things I can't repair
All it takes are a few good breaks and suddenly
I'm there

But though it's late in the day

I know I'll find my way soon
Show me a place in the sun
Cuz somewhere on the journey
It's the strength to go on
So let the dark fade
Show me a break in the cloud
Cuz every day I'm waiting
Brings me one degree down

I know I'll find my way soon
Show me a place in the sun
Cuz somewhere on the journey
It's the strength to go on
So let the dark fade
Show me a break in the cloud
Cuz every day I'm waiting
Brings me one degree down
