I'm feeling stagnant
I'm spreading myself in
My reactions to everything around me changing
Bury myself inside my bed and inside my mind
and I'll be lucky if I make it out alive

Home to an old friend to see what he thought of the thoughts I've been thinking lately
His words put my nerves in the dirt, with an urgency in his voice he said
"With the blink of an eye we'll be waiting to die in a retirement home in Florida
Let's get out of bed even when we don't wanna"

Like gravity we keep pulling ourselves down
and we're waiting for something better so we can just lift it back up ourselves
Sinking every ounce of daylight, stay up every second at night time
The only thing we'll regret is not knowing what regret feels like

I'm gonna walk to a place that is not my home
I'm gonna skateboard 'till I've broken every bone
I'm gonna say "yes" when I just say "no"
When I'm dead it's gonna' read on my tombstone
"Life is something to laugh about"

Like gravity we keep pulling ourselves down
and we're waiting for something better so we can just lift it back up ourselves
Sinking every ounce of daylight, stay up every second at night time
The only thing we'll regret is not knowing what regret feels like
