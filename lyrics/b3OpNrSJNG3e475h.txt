Listen, I know it's been hard
You know it's no different for me
We're less than a zero-sum game now
And baby we both know that's not how it's supposed to be

The writing's on the wall
It seems like forever
Since we had a good day
The writing's on the wall

But I, I just want to get you high tonight
I just wanna see some pleasure in your eyes
Some pleasure in your eyes

I go too high, and you go too cold
And we both fall apart
Then you bring your mind, to rest against mine
But the mind has no say on affairs of the heart

The writing's on the wall
It seems like forever
Since we had a good day
The writing's on the wall

But I, just want to get you high tonight
I just wanna see some pleasure in your eyes
Some pleasure in your eyes

Then you bring your mind, to rest against mine
But the mind has no say on affairs of the heart

The writing's on the wall
It seems like forever
Since we had a good day
The writing's on the wall

But I, just want to get you high tonight
I, just want to see some pleasure in your eyes
Some pleasure in your eyes

I, just want to get you high
Just want to get you high
Just want to get you high
Even if it's the last thing that we do together

Even if it's the last thing we do together
