Aye, yah, yah, hey
Yeah, hurt yourself some more like you can't feel a thing
Yah, aye, keep lies to yourself and hate the words you sing (fuck)

Yeah, I'm not that lost, I trust no-one
They lie then stop, fucks my head up (break)
Pick a side, pick a side, decide then rot
Don't take advice, look straight, turn backs then run (break)
Yeah, I'm not that lost, I trust no-one
They lie then stop, fucks my head up (die, fuck)
Pick a side, pick a side, decide then rot (die)
Don't take advice, look straight, turn backs then run (die)

Yuh, bitch, it's enough, bitch, that you fuck with
Ducking questions that they ask me, no discussions
Fuck this, they always be tryna push my buttons
All in, I will just go harder 'til I'm ballin'
Tacky, still attacking, why you ask me?
Act sick, they get nasty, they ain't asking
Flashy in the backseat like I'm fancy
Baggy, pants be matching like an athlete (die)

That bitch gon' come to my room, hey
Filming the things that we do, hey
I hate the things that I do
I blame the things I consume, hey (die)
Stack, stack, stack my bricks, hey
If I'm lit, I spend, hey
Fuck her once then dip, hey
I can't wife no bitch
Drink until I wobble, yah (die)
Her name, I forgot it, yah
My wallet's colossal, yah
I'm my own role model, yah
Lately, I've been hostile, yah
Keep them feelings bottled, yah
I'll be back like Arnold, yah
Got no time for squabbles, yah
Visable, this shit is critical
Nothing is difficult, they say we're criminals (fuck)
Just keep it minimal, pray for a miracle
Break down my syllables
I'm sounding cynical
Fade away
It's the only way
I feel my pride escape
You made the same mistakes
I lost my brain today
I have the right of way
Bitch, we might just take the blame
This is the very last time (break)

Yeah, I'm not that lost, I trust no-one
They lie then stop, fucks my head up (die, fuck)
Pick a side, pick a side, decide then rot (die)
Don't take advice, look straight, turn backs then run (break)
Y-y-yeah, I'm not that lost, I trust no-one
They lie then stop, fucks my head up (die, fuck)
Pick a side, pick a side, decide then rot (die)
Don't take advice, look straight, turn backs then run (die, yah, aye)

Yeah, hurt yourself some more like you can't feel a thing (die)
Yeah, aye, keep lies to yourself and hate the words you sing (fuck)
Inside, inside, inside, inside
