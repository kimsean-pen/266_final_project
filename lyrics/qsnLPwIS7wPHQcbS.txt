I see the consequence
You know I'm watching you
It's just a throwaway sin
I'm proud enough of you

How can I walk the street?
How can I raise my head?
We kill a million deep
Just in a single breath

And it's a crowded house
We can't get enough and
Never run out in a crowded room
We bite the hand, so much to lose

What are we building here?
Among the dead cement
Out in the plastic sea
We drown the innocent
I seen the motor smoke
I seen the house of pulp
We wear the velvet glove
But we keep on burning up

And it's a crowded house
We can't get enough and
Never run out in a crowded room
We bite the hand, so much to lose

And it's a crowded house
We can't get enough and
Never run out in a crowded room
We bite the hand, so much to lose
