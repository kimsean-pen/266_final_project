This is my best
This is my worst
It's nothing, I promise

Don't you get lost
When I am small
You have my world

The hero returns
In the heart
After she's learned
How to love herself
In both heaven or hell

Sensitive infinitely
The God of ages heart
And mystery came to my breath

Lose truth in the dark
They guide you
Look inside, don't look back
Don't hide you

Lose truth in the dark
They guide you
Look inside, don't look back
Don't hide you

The hero returns
In the heart
After she's learned
How to love herself

Lose truth in the dark
They guide you
Look inside, don't look back
Don't hide you

Lose truth in the dark
They guide you
Look inside, don't look back
Don't hide you
