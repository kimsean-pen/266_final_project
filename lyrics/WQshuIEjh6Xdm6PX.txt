Oh, it's set in 1848
In the crush of New York State
And the thing about destiny
Is it never ever makes mistakes

Oh, Susan B. Anthony
Forever haunting me
Owned, raped, sold and thrown
A woman was never her own

They cried, "Freedom, rise up for me"
They cried, "Freedom, rise up for me"
Check it out

Yeah, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
Yeah, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want yeah

Oh, it's set in 1848
In the crush of New York State
And the thing about destiny
Is it never ever sets you free

Oh, Elizabeth Cady
Forever reminding me
I don't steal the air I breathe

Freedom, rise up for me
Freedom, rise up for me

Yeah, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
Yeah, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want

Freedom, rise up for me
Freedom rise up for me, yeah
