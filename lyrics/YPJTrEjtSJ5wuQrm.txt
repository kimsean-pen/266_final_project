There was always a presence
In the tantalizing shadows of your dreams
An enigmatic whisper
Resonating though your very being

And now you have come too far
The paths you followed here are gone
This is the black, this is the night
This is your dawn

It was always a part of you
Like a seed, a destiny in your blood
From which there was no escape
The unconditional absence of god

There is no return
It's too late
The eyes of the abyss already deep inside
You stayed too long and now you leave but nothing changes

It is far too late
The dreams will bleed into your waking hours
And now you belong

To something that is yours and yours alone
No return
You have come too far the paths followed here are gone

This is the black, this is the night
This is your dawn
Arcana Imperii.
