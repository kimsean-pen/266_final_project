It's safe to say we've always been actors.
From time to time I think about what everything would be like if we made one good scene.
Apathetic time turns us into awkward passing nerves, where nothing is ever beautiful and everything hurts.
Because I loved you first,
And we never sang those sad songs together.
Our bodies they break down.
Our honesty is breaking my heart.
Whenever we're close neither one of us will change, because I'm chained to the past with the future in my veins.

There is a car in the driveway.
Just drive." she said. "
There is a train downtown.
We could hop right on and get out of here." We've been running away from things we can't control.
We can never settle down.
We're always scared.
Our hearts won't stop beating.
But we've just got to sit this out until we hit level ground until the terrain gets easier.
And then only there can we rest our lonely hearts.
