Tonal unbalance. Fractal waveworms.
Shuttered fluorescence.
Insular and mellifluous.
Invasive and entropic.
Bending in a tandem.
Eating marrow by vibration.
humming hoarse with desire
the sound of all being.
thrumming in all deepest pits.
A thrum in the deep.
catalytic trill.
blooming from God's feet.
from the chasm.
A soul unwound.
ljudet av gud.
a thrum in the deep.
ljudet av gud.
