Don't I know what they all want?
A perfect Speci â€“ Men, I reel them in at once
Every move I make, I flaunt
Get pretty like I mean it, a real debutante
I know I'm surely hot
When they put up a fuss
Get anything I want
I do command applause
Don't mean to turn 'em out
It seems it's just because
It's something that I got
They don't know what it was
But every time I close my eyes
What is it I'm dreaming of?
A perfect life
Wake up, I know every time, all doey-eyed
And I think about you
Oh-oh-oh you
Every time I close my eyes
I'm nearer to the day my love
Needs no disguise
I'll chase it 'til the end of time
The perfect life
It can't be without you, ooo-oo
Can't be without you-oo

Wish that I could be upfront
Like an army general, with no nuance
But blooming out here in the sun
A guarded little thing, turns perfect all at once
What is this bug I've caught?
What's it an aching of?
I cover up the spots
I wear it like a glove
Can entertain them all
Create a flawless buzz
But it ain't perfect, not
Until I fall in love
Every time I close my eyes

What is it I'm dreaming of?
A perfect life
Wake up, I know every time, all doey-eyed
And I think about you
Oh- oh-oh you
Every time I close my eyes
I'm nearer to the day my love
Needs no disguise
I'll chase it 'til the end of time
The perfect life
It can't be without you, ooo-oo
Can't be without you-oo
