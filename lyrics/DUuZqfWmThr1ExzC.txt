You know
We can't do this
We just can't
Listen
You say you feel disenchanted
'Cause lately he takes you for granted
Still faithful and true you've remained
And to her, so have I
You pour out your heart and I listen
And we catch a vibe reminiscin'
Temptation so strong not to mention
The yearning inside
But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
'Cause I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
'Cause if we lay down tonight
It won't justify throwin' love aside, no no
This feelin' is strong and we know it
But we gotta see past the moment
There's too much to lose if we flow it
This is no lie
Still here we are close together
With promises made that we'd never
Yet feeling it now more than ever
I can't deny
But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
'Cause if we lay down tonight
It just won't justify throwing love aside
Here we are all alone
But somehow we've got to be strong
But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
'Cause if we lay down tonight
Makes me wanna say ooh
Just gotta say ooh
Makes me wanna say ooh
Just gotta say ooh
What kind of man could I be
Oh can't be unfaithful, sorry baby
