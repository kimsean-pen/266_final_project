For a second there I thought you disappeared
It rains a lot this time of year
And we both go together if one falls down
I talk out loud like you're still around
No, no

And I miss you, I'm going back home to the west coast
I wish you would've put yourself in my suitcase
I love you, standing all alone in a black coat
I miss you, I'm going back home to the west coast

And if you shake her hard enough, she will appear
Tonight, I think I'll be staying here
And you never did like this town
I talk out loud like you're still around
No, no

And I miss you, I'm going back home to the west coast
I wish you would've put yourself in my suitcase
I love you, standing all alone in a black coat
I miss you, I'm going back home to the west coast

Come on, everybody

So, pack up the bags to beat back the clock
Do I let her sleep or should I wake her up?
You said
We both go together if one falls down
I talk out loud like you're still around
No, no

And I miss you, I'm going back home to the west coast
I wish you would've put yourself in my suitcase
I love you, standing all alone in a black coat
I miss you, I'm going back home to the west coast

Going back home to the west coast
Going back home to the west coast
