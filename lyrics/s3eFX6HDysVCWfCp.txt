Have you ever had a feeling
That we're not alone?
All the calls I've been receivin'
They are not from no one
Going down the dusty roads
We are cold and see-through

I need you

There's a reason after all
All the things that I have done
Pump the blood and leave it alone
Anywhere you take me

See it all
Just go and solve it all
