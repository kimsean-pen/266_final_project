I know this girl, she's not too bright
But she's educated in bed alright
She's made seduction a work of art
A PhD with her legs apart

She's got dreamy eyes, lolita lips
She's got undulating grundulating grinding hips
She clicks her fingers, guys come to heal
Chewed up, spat out, no big deal

Racy Lacey, boudoir beauty
It's all that she can do
A connoisseur of satin sheets
A red head through and through

Racy Lacey, boudoir beauty
The lifestyle suits her fine
The girl ain't backward in coming forward
She's got this crazy line

And so this girl, I've heard it said
Can spend up to twenty four hours in bed
She gets her suitors to wait in line
And she's worn them out by half past nine

She's got dreamy eyes, lolita lips
She's got undulating grundulating grinding hips
She clicks her fingers, guys come to heel
Chewed up, spat out, no big deal

Racy Lacey, boudoir beauty
It's all that she can do
A connoisseur of satin sheets
A red head through and through

Racy Lacey, boudoir beauty
The lifestyle suits her fine
The girl ain't backward in coming forward
She's got this crazy line

She's got dreamy eyes, lolita lips
She's got undulating grundulating grinding hips
She clicks her fingers, guys come to heel
Chewed up, spat out, no big deal

Racy Lacey, boudoir beauty
It's all that she can do
A connoiseur of satin sheets
A red head through and through

Racy Lacey, boudoir beauty
The lifestyle suits her fine
The girl ain't backward in coming forward
She's got this crazy line
