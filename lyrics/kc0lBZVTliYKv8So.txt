There's a reason why
So many dreams have died
On one steep hill
For a lit up sign
You can sell your soul
For a two bit role
Like Jayne Mansfield
You can lose control

It's not that I do what I shouldn't
I do what Hollywoodn't, I do what Hollywoodn't
They say change, I should but I couldn't
I do what Hollywoodn't, I do what Hollywoodn't

You can lose your mind
On Mulholland drive
Just to highlight your one line
Glossy eight by ten
A town of tanning beds
Oh, here we go again

Roller coaster ride
Watch it slowly rise
It falls so fast, is it worth the climb?
After racing down, it goes round and round
For the lucky ones, it goes upside-down

It's not that I do what I shouldn't
I do what Hollywoodn't, I do what Hollywoodn't
They say change, I should but I couldn't
I do what Hollywoodn't, I do what Hollywoodn't

You can lose your mind
On Mulholland drive
Just to highlight your one line
Glossy eight by ten
A town of tanning beds
Oh, here we go again

It's not that I do what I shouldn't
I do what Hollywoodn't, I do what Hollywoodn't
They say change, I should but I couldn't
I do what Hollywoodn't, I do what Hollywoodn't

You can lose your mind
On Mulholland drive
Just to highlight your one line
Glossy eight by ten
A town of tanning beds
Oh, here we go again
