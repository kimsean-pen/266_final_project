This is the resistance movement
A new life for the executed
The black listed soul recruitment, Brainwashed!
Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off

We're spilling our guts, we're spitting out blood
Who's first in the river?!
Stop struggling, struggling
You'll only sink further in

We're spilling our guts, we're spitting out blood
Who's first in the river?!
They're throwing you in a lifeline, down to hell they'll sing

Mislead, mislead, drain us of our
Differences keep the freedom of life
Under the gun they'll take our rights
We'll take them back again

This is a death race, just another world trait of a broken system
It's like the blind lead the blind to the wrong decisions
Possessed by the pace of life, we'll burn a living
They're running out of plots to burn the casualties
Out of sight, Out of mind

Mislead, mislead, drain us of our differences
Keep the freedom of life under the gun
They'll take our rights, we'll take them back again

We won't fail, we'll find a way
We won't fail, we'll fucking find a way
We won't fail, we'll find a way

Tell us how to think, tell us what we need
Tell us how to live, show us who to be
Another product of the system
Turn it off, turn it off
We're being Brainwashed!
