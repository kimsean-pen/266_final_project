Oh I can feel it now
Feel my heart beat through the ground
6 feet under
Oh out there
There's somewhere I belong
I wanna know, I just wanna know, oh

Oh, can you hear me now
Screaming out but there's no sound
Just an echo
Blood, sweat, tears
Wipe the dirt from my eyes
Claw out this hole
I'm letting go
And now is the time

Where are the ones who didn't fall
Didn't fall Bet it all Who didn't fall
Where are the ones who didn't fall

I can't breathe
With no air
Cause I'm still searching for something
To take me away from here

Where are the ones who didn't fall
Didn't fall Bet it all Who didn't fall
Where are the ones who didn't fall

I can't breathe
With no air
Cause I'm still searching for something
Take me away from here

Take me away from here
Didn't fall Bet it all Who didn't fall
Where are the ones who didn't fall
Take me away from here
Didn't fall Bet it all Who didn't fall
Where are the ones who didn't fall

Oh I can see it now
I was lost but now I'm found
Finally breathing
