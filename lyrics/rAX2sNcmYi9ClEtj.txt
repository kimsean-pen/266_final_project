I never had it bad like this before
I gained a couple battle scars
But I never thought I'd be losing this war
Surrender doesn't cut it like it did before
So you can put your white flag down, hold out your hand
Don't let go 'cause this love is worth fighting for

And sometimes it feels like the winter has come
And sometimes I bleed like, run, river, run
And sometimes it don't feel right, like you're my enemy
And sometimes I question whether you'll be the death of me
Whether you'll be the death of me

Do you remember when you were young?
Before you went and built a wall out of a heart of stone
No one can reach you, you're on your own
Don't give up on yourself too soon
If you're looking for a deeper love, jump down inside
There's nowhere to run and there's nowhere for you to hide

And sometimes it feels like the winter has come
And sometimes I bleed like, run, river, run
And sometimes it don't feel right, like you're my enemy
And sometimes I question whether you'll be the death of me
Whether you'll be the death of me

My angel, if you fall
I will catch you
I will catch you
My lover in the night
I will meet you
I will meet you

And sometimes it feels like the winter has come
And sometimes I bleed like, run, river, run
And sometimes it don't feel right, like you're my enemy
And sometimes I question whether you'll be the death of me
Whether you'll be the death of me

Whether you'll be the death of me
(I will catch you, I will catch you)
Whether you'll be the death of me
(I will meet you, I will meet you)
Whether you'll be the death of me
