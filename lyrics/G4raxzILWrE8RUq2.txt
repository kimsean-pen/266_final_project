The wandering fire ... the fire woodlands filling;
in glades for ever green it glows,
In dells immortal immortal dew distilling
The flower that in secret fragrance grows.

Uncounted leagues away it lies from here,
And foam there flowers ... there flowers upon the sea
By cliffs of crystal ... of crystal carven clear
On shining beaches ... beaches blowing free.

Through the gleaming ... vales its singing going,
Were breathing keen on bent and briar
The wind beyond ... beyond the world's end blowing
To living flame the wandering fire.

Uncounted leagues away it lies from here,
And foam there flowers ... there flowers upon the sea
By cliffs of crystal ... of crystal carven clear
On shining beaches ... beaches blowing free.

The wandering fire ... the fire with tongues of flame
With light there ... there kindles quick and clear
The land forgotten ... of long forgotten name:
No man may ever may ever anchor near
