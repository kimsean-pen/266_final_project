Can't hide my glee now you're in front of me
Face says you're here and I'm wanting you
Can't hide my frustration or my impatience
Tell me how do I get to you?
It helps decide that maybe I
I'm a little less stubborn than you
So it hurts my soul, I may never know
Just exactly how I feel for you
Ooh, does it make you feel good
Knowing that you could
Have power on me?
And ooh, does it make you feel good
Knowing that you could
Have power on me?
I wish I'd seen when it happened to be
That I could fall to you so deeply
So glad I knew not to rush things with you
Cause now you've grown on me so naturally
So intriguing, you got me feeling
I could stare at you for hours
So why's your hold so warm then cold?
Oh please don't be a coward
Ooh, does it make you feel good
Knowing that you could
Have power on me?
And ooh, does it make you feel good
Knowing that you could
Have power on me?
So does it make you feel good?
Cause it's the only way I want you to feel with me
Now what's it make you feel like?
Do you feel somehow you could open up your heart to me?
So does it make you feel good?
Cause it's the only way I want you to feel with me
Now what's it make you feel like?
Do you feel somehow you could open up your heart to me?
Ooh, does it make you feel good
Knowing that you could
Have power on me?
And ooh, does it make you feel good
Knowing that you could
Have power on me?
