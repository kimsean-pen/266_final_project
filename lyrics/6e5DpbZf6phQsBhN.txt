I don't trust you cause you dab with the left hand
I keep something up on my hip, that's my right hand
All my dogs come first
All lost in the purp
Left hand doing numbers
Right hand doing work

Left hand, right hand
Left hand, right hand
Left hand, right hand
Right hand, right hand
Left be working in the right
Coming right back
Yeah I left to get it right
Now I'm right back

Steerthe wheel with my knee while I count up bands
I show love and affection to all my fans
I got Ferragamo holding up my pants
I turn up on the stage while I hit my dance
I get serious when it comes to business
Don't waste my time boy you know that I ain't playing
I got a clique of niggas with me
We dumb twenty hoes laying where I'm staying
I never dap you with the left hand
I draw down with the Glock in the right hand
I got podnas with me when I walked in
Live shooters waiting and I'm screaming fan
I swear that I'm hot boy I need a fan
I got prices and sell and they all paying
Make it work while I'm using the left hand
Bring it back while I'm using the right hand

I don't trust you cause you dab with the left hand
I keep something up on my hip, that's my right hand
All my dogs come first
All lost in the purp
Left hand doing numbers
Right hand doing work

Left hand, right hand
Left hand, right hand
Left hand, right hand
Right hand, right hand
Left be working in the right
Coming right back
Yeah I left to get it right
Now I'm right back

Know my feel I'm speedin' the twi
Drilling a hole while I'm using a nail
Dump in the cut while G wrapping a bail
Ben at the street while he watchin' for 12
Straighten up my hand right after they deal
Dope ain't come back when I whipped so I fail
Stroke got pack coming all through the mail
DP had that purp floating all through the jail
Mac and a Compaq I work off of a Dell
Left and right hand I use both 'em well
Right and the left I can use for the sprayer
Don't get in my way, I ain't taking a L
Ain't got no room, I'm a grinder forreal
Way I'ma be, only timing could tell
You know I go hard, I be bringing them here
I'm washing the residue off of my nails

I don't trust you cause you dab with the left hand
I keep something up on my hip, that's my right hand
All my dogs come first
All lost in the purp
Left hand doing numbers
Right hand doing work

Left hand, right hand
Left hand, right hand
Left hand, right hand
Right hand, right hand
Left be working in the right
Coming right back
Yeah I left to get it right
Now I'm right back
