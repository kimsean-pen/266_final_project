Mmmh oh

You had me the way you always wanted
Why the fuck would you taint that shit you promised?
I gotta give you props for trying
Doing the most, but damn boy it's tiring
And i'm sorry that you wanna be this way

PRE HOOK:
Oh yeah, don't tell me lies, baby
Come on now, i weren't born yesterday baby

You know what to do since you think you know best
Go take a hike, i don't need that round here
Don't hit my line when you're feeling lonely
Ay, baby
You know what to do since you think you know best
Go take a hike, i don't need that round here
Don't hit my line when you're feeling lonely
Ay, baby

You say this thing here is far from over
But i refuse to believe your mind is sober
How in the hell does it feel knowing
You ain't shit now and you weren't beforehand?
And i ain't got the time man, you talk too much

PRE HOOK:
Oh yeah, don't tell me lies, baby
Come on now, i weren't born yesterday baby

You know what to do since you think you know best
Go take a hike, i don't need that round here
Don't hit my line when you're feeling lonely
Ay, baby
You know what to do since you think you know best
Go take a hike, i don't need that round here
Don't hit my line when you're feeling lonely
Ay, baby

Mm ohhh
