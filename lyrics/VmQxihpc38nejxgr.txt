With a song in my heart
And a chance to be yours forever
I couldn't feel more secure
I know I couldn't feel any better
Oh Lord, Heaven knows
How much I love you and
How much it shows
Oh Lord, Heaven
Heaven knows

Every time we're together
Your love is moving like lightning through me
It's such a beautiful feeling
Never hearing good-bye said to me

Oh Lord, Heaven knows
How much I love you and
How much it shows
Oh Lord, Heaven
Heaven knows

I was living without you
Trying to make it alone
But there is something about you
Now your heart is my home

With a song in my heart
And a chance to be yours forever
I couldn't feel more secure
I know I couldn't feel any better
Oh Lord, Heaven knows
How much I love you and
How much it shows
Oh Lord, Heaven
Heaven knows

Oh Lord, Heaven knows
How much I love you and
How much it shows
Oh Lord, Heaven
Heaven knows
