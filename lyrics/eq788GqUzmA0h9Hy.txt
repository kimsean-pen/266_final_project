False, the dream is so far
Come and take the consequence
Feel things are as certain
Winter state oppressive wait

Evacuate, assemble here
Soil's song in your throat
Future death in your reach
Who's first? Okay

Mask your face well hidden
Keep your last words in your hand
Fold it and open up
Time to go, release the glow

Evacuate, assemble here
Soil's song in your throat
Future death in your reach
Who's first? Okay

False, the dream is over

Evacuate, assemble here
Soil's song in your throat
Future death in your reach
Who's first? Okay

Evacuate, assemble here
Soil's song in your throat
Future death in your reach
Who's first? Okay

Sort of raise
Thank you
