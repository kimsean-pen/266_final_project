Mirror, mirror upon the wall
magic demon eye
a realm of madness
awakened by the call
Speak the ancient words of mages
try to take control
the essence of evil,
a challenge for your soul

The battle of minds
the riddle the rhymes
beware of the darkness behind
usurped and enslaved
redeemed and betrayed
the devil in the mirror, obey!
Iridescent pulsation light
glowing in its heart
the surface is reflecting
nightmares of your mind
Green mist swirling deep within
a dark dimension takes from
the grip of clawed hands drags you inside
The battle of minds
the riddle the rhymes
beware of the darkness behind
usurped and enslaved
redeemed and betrayed
the devil in the mirror, obey!
Enchanted with powers to conquer your soul
good or evil it won't mind
the mirror of darkness is blind
Feel the presence, the voice of the dark
break the balance, intrudes your mind
try to deny, oh master of fools
captured forever, the loser learns the rules
