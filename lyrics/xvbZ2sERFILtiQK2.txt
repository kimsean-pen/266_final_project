Away, I see it's going down today
Hoping in time
We'll bury all this pain
And will awake something inside

We pushed our buttons far inside, we tear our hearts out
Then we fight

Hey, I know
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known
I cannot survive alone
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known

Our lives were good in everyway, too late
Time after time
Our love just turned to hate
But we stayed by each other's side

We pushed our buttons far inside, we tear our hearts out
Then we fight

Hey, I know
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known
I cannot survive alone
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known

I keep holding on
I feel I'm where I belong
Everytime time we fight it feels so wrong
I feel so enslaved by my pride
Then we meet again

We pushed our buttons far inside, we tear our hearts out
Then we fight

Hey, I know
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known
I cannot survive alone
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known
