Found an empty room, locked the door shut.
Party raged on, you could only hear the bass thump.
With two empty cups, my heart it all came pouring out.
You're white russian, just let me be your boy scout.
And when I'm gone do you think about me.
Since you came back, I see things differently.
And this love, came so easily.
We were talking in the dark,
But its so clear to me,

I adore you.
Cuz you dont care where I came from.
Just kiss me, in the dark while my lips are numb.
And I love, every inch of you and then some, and then some, and then some.

Face to face, tell me what you've seen
I'm the town crier, and you're reluctant royalty.
I understand just where you get second thoughts.
I'm new years eve, and you're waiting for the ball to drop.
And when I'm gone do you think about me.
When you dream, do I make the screen.
And this love, came so easily.
Can you see us shining there, up on the marquee.

I adore you,
cuz you dont care where I came from.
Just kiss me, in the dark while my lips are numb.
And I love, every inch of you and then some, and then some, and then some.

And then some and then some.
And then some and then some.
And then some and then some.

And when I'm gone do you think about me.
When I'm gone, do you think about me.
When you dream, do I make the screen.
We were talking in the dark.

I adore you,
cuz you dont care where I came from.
Just kiss me, in the dark while my lips are numb.
And I love, every inch of you and then some.
And then some and then some.

I adore you,
cuz you dont care where I came from.
Just kiss me, in the dark while my lips are numb.
And I love, every inch of you and then some.
And then some and then some.

And then some and then some.
And then some and then some.
And then some and then some.
And then some and then some.
