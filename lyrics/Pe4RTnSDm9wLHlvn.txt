Bitch I'm breakin out my mothafuckin chains I'm a black mage
I'm never gna rep no shit but kreep, now I'm out the cage
I'm shittin all over the rules you gave, and now I turn the page
I'm a way better man than I'm ever gna be when all I can do is obey
I'm taking your blood and now I'm painting a circle around my feet
Protecting me from Aiwas and d√¶mons in his company
You never gna be like me so bitch go get your own steez
You never gna see what I see I'm the K R double E P the reincarnated beast

I am a mistake
And I really don't have a solid end-game
All I really wanna be
Is a monk in a stone monastery
I am a mistake
And I really don't have a solid end-game
I meditate all day
Contemplate how I'm gna leave this place

I don't
I don't know where to go but up
I
Just can't seem to get my fix of a good life
One where I don't need to break ties

Don't recycle just get rid of everything you hate

Kreepin through the gates of an unknown place
I can feel my heart race
And my blood leave my face
I'm about to welcome change
with a fresh embrace
About to decapitate another useless piece of waste
I'm a kreep
I don't weep
I never sleep
ima freak
Counting sheep
I don't know sympathy
