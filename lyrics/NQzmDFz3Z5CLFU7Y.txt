I bet you never heard ol' Marshall Dillon say
"Miss Kitty, have you ever thought of runnin' away?
settling' down, would you marry me?
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please?"

she'd have said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot
His heart wasn't in it, he just stole a kiss and he rode away
He never hung his hat up at Kitty's place

Shoulda been a cowboy, should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter, ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin' a young girl's heart, just like Gene and Roy
Sang a few campfire songs, yeah, I should've been a cowboy

Might've had a sidekick with a funny name
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James
Ending up on the brink of danger
And riding shotgun with the Texas Rangers

Go west, young man
Haven't you been told, California's full of whiskey,
women and gold
Hidin' out 'neath the desert stars
With a dream in my eye and a prayer in my heart

Oh, shoulda been a cowboy, should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter, ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin' a young girl's heart, oh, just like Gene and Roy
I sang a few campfire songs, I should've been a cowboy

Oh, shoulda been a cowboy, should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter, ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin' a young girl's heart, just, like Gene and Roy
I sang a few campfire songs, yeah, I should've been a cowboy

Shoulda been a cowboy, should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter, ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin' a young girl's heart just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those campfire songs, oh, I should've been a cowboy

A cowboy, should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter, ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin' a young girl's heart, yeah, just like Gene and Roy
I sang a few campfire songs, oh, I should've been a cowboy
