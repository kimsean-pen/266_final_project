Punch your ticket, get your kicks on the early bus out
Checkered paths planning a future
Slowly roaming around
Secretly having a fling with a single mom
Hey, you're on a good one
Write sometime or call sometime when you're drunk

Let me put you up
Put you up in the guest house
We got a great couch I found it sitting on the sidewalk
One of these days, one day, you're really gonna need someone
When things get bad with no companion to complain on

Heed to the roads and the stars in the sky
Lean under oaks when your legs are tired
When they're tired

It's all fixed, I sent your tickets but they came back
I had you on the AMTRAK
I thought you might like, I thought you might like that
Felt so long, right or wrong, it would be so bad
Just keep it on a straight path, get right back
Let me know where you're at

Heed to the roads and the stars in the sky
Sleep under oaks if your legs get tired
Heed to the roads and the stars in the sky
Lean under oaks when your legs get tired
When they're tired

Let me put you up, put you up
Let me put you up, put you up
Let me put you up, put you up
Let me put you up, put you up
