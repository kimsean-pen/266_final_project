You've got a razor tongue
And your words cut me open, bloody and broken
Let's let this soak in
I thought I'd never wanna see you again
But I saw you again last night
And now I'm gonna do what I said I'd never do
I'm throwing all my pride away and crawling back to you
If breaking all my rules is something that I have to do,
Then I hope you break yours too (do you remember saying)
Our goodbyes in your room
We'll pack our things and leave, come back next year to see the
Strangers that we've let ourselves become
One last goodbye on the
Shoulder you cried on, let
You dry your eyes on my
Blue shirt that you loved
I know that you'll sleep fine without me by your side
Without me by your side
I took the long way to your house so I could see if your light was on, in your bedroom
And now I know that you're the one who I'll compare everyone else to
My heart is black and blue, we're getting older too
And keeping everything inside is something that I do
We used to make this happen
We used to make this -
Happen (Think back on everything we said)
Everything that we abandoned
The swings behind your house might as well be broken now
We were lying to ourselves
One last goodbye on the
Shoulder you cried on, let
You dry your eyes on my
Blue shirt that you loved
I know that you'll sleep fine without me by your side
Without me by your side
And there's just some things about me
That you will never understand
Things will never go back to the way that they used to be
Things will never go back to the way that they used to be
