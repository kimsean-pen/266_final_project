Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh

You walk and talk like you're some new sensation
You move in circles, you don't need an invitation
You spent your money, you can't get no satisfaction
You play it right, so you can get the right reaction

It won't be long my darling
Pick up the phone, nobody's on it
Where are your friends now, baby?
Are they the ones supposed to be there for

You (you)
When you're falling down, the world starts spinning out
You (you, ah)
When you're falling down, know it's not all about
You (you, ah)
When you're falling down, you know I'll be around
When you're falling down, falling down

(When you're falling down, you're falling down, down, you're falling down)

What kind of place when you look into the mirror?
The truth is blurry, but the lies are getting clearer
Your eyes are fixed, your smile's so elastic
You give me roses, but they're all just made of plastic

It won't be long my darling
Pick up the phone, nobody's on it
Where are your friends now, baby?
Are they the ones supposed to be there for

You (you, ah)
When you're falling down, the world starts spinning out
You (you, ah)
When you're falling down, know it's not all about
You (you, ah)
When you're falling down, you know I'll be around
When you're falling down, falling

Smile for the camera, everybody's looking at you
Smile for the camera, 'cause, they're all about to trash you
Smile for the camera (camera, camera)
Smile for the camera, who's gonna catch you?

(Ah, ah)
You (you)
(Ah, you, ah)

You (you, ah)
When you're falling down, the world starts spinning out
You (you, ah)
When you're falling down, know it's not all about
You (you, ah)
When you're falling down, you know I'll be around
When you're falling down, falling

Smile for the camera, everybody's looking at you
Smile for the camera, 'cause, they're all about to trash you
