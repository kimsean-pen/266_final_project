Colorize the sadness, the fear is black and white
Tunnel of denial, looking for the light
The devil on my shoulder, the master of disguise
Can you hear him singing?

Release me from the past, this tortured life I've sewn
I'm beaten down, I'm tired of being alone
I can hear the silence, screams into my soul
The truce is ringing

Free me from this place I'm in
Mother, wash away my sins
'Cause I am alive (I am alive)
Save me from this bleeding heart
Father, show me where to start
'Cause I am alive

'Cause I am alive

Bathed in contradiction, the lies just never end
Drowning from temptation
The lines, they don't pretend
The weight of broken wishes, will they ever mend?
This demon's still singing, yeah

Free me from this place I'm in
Mother, wash away my sins
'Cause I am alive (I am alive)
Save me from this bleeding heart
Father, show me where to start
'Cause I am alive

Wash away the April rain
Dissolve the tears
The wounds, the pain
Jaded, I'm jaded
Kill the monkey in my veins
The sickness swimming in my brain
Bated, I'm bated
Faded, so faded

Yeah, free me from this place I'm in
Mother, wash away my sins
'Cause I am alive (I am alive)
Save me from this bleeding heart
Father, show me where to start
'Cause I am alive (I am alive)

Come on and free me
Come on and wash me
'Cause I am alive (I am alive)
Come on and save me
Come on and show me
'Cause I am alive

I'm alive
Yeah
I'm alive
