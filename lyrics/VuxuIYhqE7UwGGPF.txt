Now the world is getting older
There's a few things to be said
Do you believe the things they told you
Do you believe the things you've read

There's a rumour on the corner
But it's always been denied
Cause they don't want you any wiser
You're just toeing the party line

From the west side to the east side
From the north side to the south
You'll never get back information
If you believe in the word of mouth

Look out for those who still want to hang on
Look out for those who live in the past
Get out and listen to the whisper
Because the times are changing fast

From the west side to the east side
From the north side to the south
You'll never get bad information
If you believe in the word of mouth

You don't believe the information
You don't believe it when it's denied
So when you're reading explanations
You have to read between the lines

From the west side to the east side
Through the windows I'm looking out
You'll never get back information
If you believe in the word of mouth
