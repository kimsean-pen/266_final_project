Does it make any sense to you
When I do everything you tell me not to do?
When you turn the corner you build for me
You can bet it's way too good to be true
So you say, you can see through the cracks in my pain
There's a satellite image like a map of my brain, my brain

Too many voices drown the ones that need to be
Heard the most. Turn it down, turn it down
Turn it down, turn it down
Everyone's gonna get their turn
So there's no need to feel lost
In the crowd, turn me up, turn me up

Turn me up, turn me up

You best be believing, best be believing
Best be believing, best be believing
Nah nah nah nah nah, nah-nah nah nah nah nah nah
You best be believing, best be believing

Best be believing, best be believing
Nah nah nah nah nah, nah-nah nah nah nah nah nah
You pray I'll stay in the sunBut that's not what I'm made of
That's not what I'm made of
