The lion woke
and found a body it can grow into
How it goes
when you've got meat and bones to chew
See the eyes
like this could be the end of the line
And that ghost
is all i need to make me know my pulse
...
But it's everything inside
inside you're alive
When i see the claws around the heart
inside you're alive
It's adrenaline that you're channelling
it's adrenaline
It's adrenaline that you're drilling in
it's adrenaline
...
The lion rose
out of body i was holding to
Beast outgrown
evolving seed rapidy to a bloom
Hear the righteous roar
no you won't let go of the chokehold
See the pride
won't let it be the end of the line
...
But it's everything inside
inside you're alive
When i see the claws around the heart
inside you're alive
It's adrenaline that you're channelling
it's adrenaline
It's adrenaline that you're drilling in
it's adrenaline
...
A lion for real lion!
A lion for real lion!
It's adrenaline that you're channelling
it's adrenaline
It's adrenaline that you're drilling in
it's adrenaline
