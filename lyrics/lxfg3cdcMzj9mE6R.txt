I, I curse the morning star
And I, I curse the moonlit sky

I trace the stars and map and mourn down the misery
Its single light up in the sky a blinding pic to me
I can't escape my destiny
I can't escape

And like a deer, still I stood on the road
As headlights approach

All of this is ending
All of this has begun
All of this is ending
Is ending
Is ending

You used to be sure that
It's me who sleeps, but can it be
Somewhere there's a life
That dreams of me
You used to be sure that
I roll the dice but can it be
Eternity
Is playing me

All of this is ending
All of this has begun
All of this is ending
Is ending
Is ending

But there's no one in
Keeping you down
If you don't bow to its wheel

I am the dreamer
I roll the dice and I align
My hands aren't tied

We are the dreamers
We rather die so we're alive
We'll always be
Masters of destiny

Like a deer pretty pole
Flesh bitten by trolls

All of this has begun
All of this is ending
Is ending
All of this is ending
All of this has begun
All of this is ending
Is ending
