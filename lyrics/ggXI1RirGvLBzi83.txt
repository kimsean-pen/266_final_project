I'm afraid of losin'
Not afraid of losin' you
Cause I don't think of you
Like I thing of mine
That I can just up and lose

I'm afraid of losin'
Losin' everything to you
My heart, my pride
A wreck inside
Nothin' on this jukebox 'cept them blues

Baby, if you go
It's over for good
And I'm as good as gone
No, it won't be long
'Til the wrong song comes on
At the right time
You're as good as gold
And I'm as good as gone

I'm worn out from worry
Not worry over you
'Cause with my troubles mine
You'll be just fine
In whatever world you choose

Baby, if you go
It's over for good
And I'm as good as gone
No, it won't be long
'Til the wrong song comes on
At the right time
You're as good as gold
And I'm as good as gone

Baby, if you go
It's over for good
And I'm as good as gone
No, it won't be long
'Till the wrong song comes on
At the right time
You're as good as gold
You're as good as gold
And I'm as good as gone
