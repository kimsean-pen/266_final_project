In one second you weren't there
But everything around me looks the same
And in that second I was scared
But who the hell am I supposed to blame?

Lately I've been using you to mess it all up
'Cause it's been easier to fall than try to walk
But the cars don't come around the way they used to

In this empty house
I called my home
Did I let you down?
I'll never know
In this empty house

Faded walls and broken glass
Dusty corridors I used to play
Hanging paintings of the past
Made me realise I need a change

Lately I've been using you to mess it all up
'Cause it's been easier to fall than try to walk
But the cars don't come around the way they used to

In this empty house
I called my home
Did I let you down?
I'll never know
In this empty house
I called my home
Did I let you down?
I'll never know
In this empty

All I need, caving in
When you went and died again
Losing time, no more late goodbyes

In this empty house
I called my home
Did I let you down?
I'll never know
In this empty house
I called my home
Did I let you down?
I'll never know
In this empty house
