Today all colours are bleeding
Across the ocean
I am sorry I couldn't stay

How does it feel to own what you are
To unstitch your heart without causing a flood
To fall but never ceasing to believe
In light taking over darkness
To breathe life in serenity

If only I knew how to forgive
If only I knew how to let go
If only I knew how to own what I am

Galaxies away
I am riding the waves of the lost
Lead this ship astray
Make me hate you again
Fear, trust, guilt, love
In the grip of a coming storm
I am sinking under the weight of a troubled sun

When bitterness conquered the heart
And left us crawling in the cold

Screaming worth a lifetime
With a voice of a follower
Always too soon
Always too late

Screaming worth a lifetime
With a voice of a follower
Always too soon
Always too late
Always in between

If only I knew how to forgive
If only I knew how to let go
If only I knew how to own what I am

If only I knew how to forgive
If only I knew how to let go
If only I knew how to own what I am
