I was driftin'
Cryin'
I was looking for another
And I was slippin' under
I pulled the devil down with me
One way or another

I'm out of my mind
Think you can wait
I'm way off the line
Think you can wait

We've been running a sleepless run
Been away from the baby way too long
We've been holding a good night gun
We've been losing our exits one by one

I'm out of my mind
Think you can wait
I'm way off the line
Think you can wait.It out

All I have is loss
Think you can wait.It out
All I have is loss
Think you can wait

What I'm thinking is simple
I'll sell apples and ice water at the temple
And I won't make trouble
I'll pull the devil down with me one way or another

We've been running a sleepless run
Been away from the baby way too long
We've been holding a good night gun
We've been losing our exits one by one

I'll try
I'll try
But I couldn't be better
All I have is loss
I'll try
But I couldn't be better
All I have is loss
I'll try
But I couldn't be better
All I have is loss
