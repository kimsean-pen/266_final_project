You fight just for the sake of it
You know what hurts the most
You might have once been faking it
But now it cuts too close

Winning the war
And losing every battle
You close the door
On happy ever after

We should have stopped it long ago
When there was love still
But we would give in to ego
And never stop until

Winning the war
And losing every battle
You close the door
On happy ever after

I know, you know
Winning the war
Is not winning at all
I know, you know
Winning the war
Is not winning at all

Winning the war
And losing every battle
You close the door
On happy ever after
