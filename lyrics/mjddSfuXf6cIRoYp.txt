* you said that was that but this is it
How were you to make the pieces fit
Into a plan to start a new life
Friends pat your back, then stab you with a knife

** I must be blind I'm gettin' ready to be defined
No [loose connections] cause it feels alright
I'm gettin ready to hit the [line]

Can you fee me inside and out, I'm just waiting for you
['cause] it's alright now I know just what I want to do

** repeat

When a day breaks, turns you around
And your world upside down
And the visions fade
Rights and wrongs and just where you've gone

** repeat

Making out is such an awful drag
And I could lose my mind and every time that I turned around
I never knew if I could really find you

[instrumental]
