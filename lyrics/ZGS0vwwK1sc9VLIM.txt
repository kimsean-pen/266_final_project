Sinking through dark black holes
It's never going to end
Open gash in my ribcage
Is never going to mend

Take another picture off the wall
Sinking deeper every time I fall

Each day ends quicker
And my mind gets slower too
As my life just fades away
I wouldn't have a clue

Take another drawer out from the shelf
I'm too weak to do it by myself

Though you had the world at your feet
You could see it, I was blind
Had the perfect job called life
You didn't like it, you resigned

Brain's a square of grass
Growing on petrol and chlorine

With petrol and chlorine
You could see it, I was blind
Had the perfect job called life
You didn't like it, you resigned

With petrol and chlorine
You know just what I mean
With petrol and chlorine
You know just what I mean
