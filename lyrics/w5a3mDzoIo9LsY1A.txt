You don't look but you kick me
You can't feel but you hit me
You can't deal with the way I pray

Why do we all have to look this way?
I gotta heart, I got blood, feel pain

Time, time is not on my side
'Cause the way I am
Gotta, gotta now, gotta find the reason why
A woman ain't a man

You don't look but you kick me
You can't feel but you hit me
You can't deal with the way I pray

Why do you all have to think this way?
I gotta heart, I got blood, feel pain

Fall in those single file lines
Like army ants
Yeah, fall on into those single file lines
And complete the plan

You don't look but you kick me
You can't feel but you hit me
You shan't deal with the way I pray

Why do you all have to think this way?
I gotta heart, I got blood, feel pain

You don't look but you kick me
You can't deal with the way I pray
