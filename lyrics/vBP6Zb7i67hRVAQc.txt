She had a beautiful mind
Always uplifting and in colors

There she goes, waving goodbye
There she goes in sunshine
There she goes, crossing the line
There she goes above time

She found the strength in all her endeavors
Providing her with a beating heart and a lust for love

There she goes waving goodbye
There she goes in sunshine
There she goes crossing the line
There she goes above time

All we have is now.
