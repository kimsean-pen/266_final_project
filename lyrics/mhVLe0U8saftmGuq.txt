woke up with fingers crossed
in a boy's bed with your pants off
after polite declines of coffee & toast.
walked home itching in last night's clothes

past the Phone Booth & the Beauty Bar
the broken windows of your neighbors' cars
through the backdoor to a message from Sis
asking who was your New Year's kiss

took the afternoon to piece it all
plus a half a dozen phone calls
crashed a party with Larissa & Chris
in pursuit of a New Year's kiss

not the way that you'd imagined it
on a balcony with champagne lips
but in a pantry against the pancake mix
you had your New Year's kiss
