Wooh hoh hoh
Hoh hoh hoh
If I give up on you I give up on me
If we fight what's true, will we ever be
Even God himself and the faith I knew
Shouldn't hold me back, shouldn't keep me from you

Tease me, by holding out your hand
Then leave me, or take me as I am
And live our lives, stigmatized

I can feel the blood rushing through my veins
When i hear your voice, driving me insane
Hour after hour day after day
Every lonely night that i sit and pray

Tease me, by holding out your hand
Then leave me, or take me as I am
And live our lives, stigmatized
Oh yeah yeah

We live our lives on different sides
But we keep together you and I
Just live our lives, oh stigmatized

We'll live our lives
We'll take the punches everyday
Oh hoh
We'll live our lives
I know we're gonna find our way
Yeah, I believe in you
Even if no one understands
Yeah, I believe in you
And i don't really give a damn
Yeah, we're stigmatized oh
We live our lives on different sides
But we keep together you and I
We live our lives on different sides
Oh hoh

We gotta live our lives
Gotta live our lives
Were gonna live our lives
Oh baby, baby
We're gonna live our lives, live our lives
Yeah, stigmatized
