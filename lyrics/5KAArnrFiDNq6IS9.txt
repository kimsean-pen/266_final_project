Inhale the strength to play
Blow barricades away
This universe implodes
Reality unloads

Find yourself a thousand worlds
Pick the one that suits you most
Will a choice put you at ease?
Than grab your chance to slay the beast

Keep searching for your destiny
And you will find all that will set you free
Keep moving onwards endlessly
(To evolve and become one) one piece

The universe implodes
When our dream state explodes

Find yourself dreaming your life
Do you truly feel alive?
Comprehend the sacred code
That makes your universe implodes

Keep searching for your destiny
And you will find all that will set you free
Keep moving onwards endlessly
To evolve and become one

Our ego will lead us to endless penance
This journey shall wake us don't dream forever

The Matrix of reality transforms the cosmic energy

Our ego won't spare us these endless failures
This journey will guide us don't dream forever
Rise

Nothing appears to be what it really is as we believe in the illusions
Free yourself from walking in circles
This will be the end of the world as we know it

Your ascension will begin

Keep searching for your destiny
And you will find all that will set you free
Keep searching for your legacy
And you will find all answers undoubtedly
Keep looking forward endlessly
To evolve and unite the world to become one piece
