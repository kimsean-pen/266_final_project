I cant wait for this to end
and leave tonight behind us
I'm unsettled letting go of you
and sleeping the night in silence

and this laptop falls along with me
onto my bed while rolling over
break my heart or break my fall
don't kiss him or cover all
memories you had of me

the last time I saw you
you were standing by his side
the last time you saw me
was through your closed eyes as I waited by the phone

He loves you
Who loves you more?
To let you go

He loves you
Who loves you more?
To let you go

I can't wait until my heart mends
So I can finally go outside
And I tell myself, well Ken
It's better to lost love
Then paint a smile and pretend

The last time I saw you
you were standing by his side
the last time you saw me
was through your closed eyes as I waited by the phone

He loves you
who loves you more?
To let you go

He loves you
who loves you more?
To let you go

The last time I saw you
you were standing by his side
the last time you saw me
was in a crumpled photograph that missed the bin

He loves you
who loves you more?
To let you go

He loves you
who loves you more?
To let you go
