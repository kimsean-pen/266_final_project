Another lonely night in December
Jaweh, Jaweh, Jaweh
It is the time of year, people remember
Jaweh, Jaweh

I can't find a word to say to you
I can't comprehend, I can't relate to you

Plain to see, no flies on me
Take me higher, angel fire
Take me where I want to go
Teach me things I need to know

Plain to see, no flies on me
Take me higher, angel fire
Take me where I want to go
Teach me things I need to know

I'm knowing this could be our last event
Jaweh, Jaweh, Jaweh
I'm knowing I am your youngest descent

I don't want to know your pain
I don't want to play the game

Plain to see, no flies on me
Take me higher, angel fire
Take me where I want to go
Teach me things I need to know

Plain to see, no flies on me
Take me higher, angel fire
Take me where I want to go
Teach me things I need to know

I can't find a word to say to you
I can't comprehend, I can't relate to you

Plain to see you're made for me
Take me higher, angel fire
Take me where I want to go
Teach me things I need to know

Can't you see you're made for me?
Take me higher, angel fire
Take me where I want to go
Teach me things I need to know

Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?
Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?
