Git a little southern drawl in my talk
Little pickup truck on my highway
Got a little boot stomp in my walk
Little neon lighting my Friday
Got some Tennessee in my whiskey
Raised a cup up if you with me

I was raised on Merle, raised on Willie
Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie
Daddy did it too, it's family tradition
If someone cranks it up, you can't help but listen
My upbringing sounds like George Strait singing
And I gotta give props to the radio, 'cause if you know me
I was raised on country

It's the only reason that I survived
Every breakup and every party
It's the soundtrack to my life
It runs deep in my DNA

I was raised on Merle, raised on Willie
Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie
Daddy did it too, it's family tradition
If someone cranks it up, you can't help but listen
My upbringing sounds like George Strait singing
And I gotta give props to the radio, 'cause if you know me
I was raised on country

(Raised on country music)
Learned a lot about living and a little 'bout love
(Raised on country music)
And you know that's something I'm so proud of

I was raised on Merle, raised on Willie
Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie
Daddy did it too, it's family tradition
If someone cranks it up, you can't help but listen
My upbringing sounds like George Strait singing
And I gotta give props to the radio, 'cause if you know me
I was raised on country

Yeah, I was raised on country
Raised on country
