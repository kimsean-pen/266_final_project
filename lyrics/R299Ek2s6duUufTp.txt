I bought your record in New York City
discorama down on Union Square
I must have played it a million times over
I'd close my eyes imagine you were there
I really dig the clothes you wear
I only wish you could be my baby
I wanna read about it
do you think we could have an affair
Maybe your heart is made of stone
maybe I'm just too blind to see
maybe your heart is made of stone
maybe I'm just too blind to see
Two weeks in Electric Lady Land
two weeks and that's all for me
I could be lucky and get off lightly
with a broken nose and the third degree
She said I really dig disco music
and if you want to be my baby
we'd better talk about it
maybe then we could have an affair
Maybe your heart is made of stone
maybe I'm just too blind to see
maybe your heart is made of stone
maybe I'm just too blind to see
I wanna drive east coast to west coast
turn up the radio and set myself free
don't wanna talk about it
you and me we should have an affair
Maybe your heart is made of stone
maybe I'm just too blind to see
maybe your heart is made of stone
maybe I'm just too blind to see
Maybe your heart is made of stone
(maybe your heart is)
maybe I'm just too blind to see
(made of stone)
maybe your heart is made of stone
(maybe your heart is)
maybe I'm just too blind to see
(made of stone)
