I was an island before you came along,
Put your boat in my sand, your hand in my hand,
Your heart in my songs.

I was a fighter, and I was so brave.
But I lowered my sword when you held me and swore
You'd stay, stay, stay oh

I can't do this alone anymore
'Cause I'm no good on my own anymore
What did I do to deserve this?
What did you do to me?
Baby, come back.
You know I don't want to be free.

I was a rebel, but I had a cause,
'Til you came to town, pushed me around,
And showed me what love was

I was a wolf, dear, apart from the pack
But you answered my cries in the dead of the night
And told me that you had my back, oh

I can't do this alone anymore
'Cause I'm no good on my own anymore
What did I do to deserve this?
What did you do to me?
Baby, come back.
You know I don't want to be free.

I can't do this alone anymore
'Cause I'm no good on my own anymore
What did I do to deserve this?
What did you do to me?
Baby, come back.
You know I don't want to be free

Oh, baby, come back.
You know I don't want to be free
No, no, no
Baby, come back
You know I don't want to be free
