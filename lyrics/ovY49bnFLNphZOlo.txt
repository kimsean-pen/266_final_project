Working hard to get it on for you, everyday and night
I give you all I've got to give, take it all
Love I know that you're feelin' blue, lonely deep inside
'Cause I know how it feels to be alone

Loving you Sunday morning
You were on my mind love everyday
Loving you Sunday morning
Your love makes me fly so far away

People tell me that I'm gonna lose you, our love will die
So tell me is it true, right or wrong
I never ever wanna lose your love, so I will change my life
Believe in me my love, I'm coming home

Loving you Sunday morning
You were on my mind love everyday
Loving you Sunday morning
Your love makes me fly so far away

Working hard to get it on for you, everyday and night
I give you all I've got to give, take it all
I never ever wanna lose your love, so I will change my life
Believe in me my love, I'm coming home

Loving you Sunday morning
You were on my mind love everyday
Loving you Sunday morning
Your love makes me fly so far away
