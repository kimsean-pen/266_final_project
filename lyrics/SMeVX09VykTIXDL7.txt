I know you want nothing more
Than just to belong, just to belong
I know you want nothing more
Than just to belong, just to belong

Skin's on fire
Let my fingers lick them beads of sweat
Every one of my regrets
Feel 'em dripping down my chest
Eyes so wide, but your vision is your weakest thing
Let your body float and sink
No, you didn't come to think

I know you want nothing more
Than just to belong
Just to belong
I know you want nothing more
Than just to belong
Just to belong

Oh, that man and his music made the heavens sing
Closest I have ever been
Wish that I could go again
Desert child, when she dances it's the sweetest thing
Closest I have ever been
Beautiful inertia spin

I know you want nothing more
Than just to belong, just to belong
I know you want nothing more
Than just to belong, just to belong

(If you love the flight, hold on for life
If you love the flight, hold on for life
If you love the flight, hold on for life
If you love the flight, love, love)
All this time you were alone
Falling, flying, no one ever really knows
All this time you were alone
Falling, flying, no one ever really knows

I know you want nothing more
Than just to belong, just to belong
I know you want nothing more
Than just to belong, just to belong
