A swarm devours the heart
The seed burns where it lay build designs of none
Roots have poisoned the clay
A flame tongued blade
Opens holes in the sky
You stand holding the gate
They've all drowned in the flood
Sun-whitened bones
In a landscape of hounds
The bound shade a light
To disperse the stars
We watch, we watch
It is of the moon
It is all of the moon
In this weather we must build fire
Distill
Break them all down
Distill
Fear them all apart
