Hello sunshine, what's your name today?

Well you look so graceful but I'm not faithful
Do you really want to be with me?
Hello summer, should I say goodbye?

Well it's been so long but I'm still thinking
If it's worth another try
Well I've got a lot to talk about
If you still want to listen or if you even care
I'm just trying to find my place in this world
And I know it's not so right to feel this way about a girl
But if you stay or if you go I'm right there with you

But you know that I'm looking for more than a pretty smile
And if I'm lucky you can stay for a while
But if you stay or if you go, I'm just hanging on again

Hello stranger, we haven't had a past

Now I learned so much, so much that time's going by so fast

Hello beautiful, it's so obvious that you're hearing every word

I said

You know, you know

That I've got a lot to talk about
If you still want to listen or if you even care
I'm just trying to find my place in this world
And I know it's not so right to feel this way about a girl
But if you stay or if you go I'm right there with you

But you know that I'm looking for more than a pretty smile
And if I'm lucky you can stay for a while
But if you stay or if you go, I'm just hanging on again

How I'd love to say, how I'd love to say

That I'm so glad I've found my place in this world
And it's so right to feel this way about a girl
But if you stay or if you go, I'm right there with you
But you know that I'm looking for more than a pretty smile
And if I'm lucky you can stay for a while
But if you stay or if you go, I'm right there with you, right
I'm just trying to find my place in this world
And I know it's not so right to feel this way about a girl
But if you stay or if you go I'm right there with you
But you know that I'm looking for more than a pretty smile
And if I'm lucky you can stay for a while
But if you stay or if you go, I'm hanging on
I'm just, I'm just hanging on
I'm just hanging on
Hello sunshine
