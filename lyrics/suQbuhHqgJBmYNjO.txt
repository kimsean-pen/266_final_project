Oh, life
Enters
By the burns on the beach
And everything goes well

And I wonder why
Oh, life
By the burns on the beach
And everything's peaceful

And I wonder what
Oh, life
Draws a line
An endless variety of beauty

And I wonder why
Oh, life
Enters
By the burns on the beach
And everything goes well

And I wonder what
Oh, life
Listens
Every breath
Every single way
