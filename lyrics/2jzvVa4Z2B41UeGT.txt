Somewhere on the waterfront
Johnny's hiding with a gun
Swears he'll kill any man that tells his story
He's not sorry for what he's done

He broke into a drugstore
To cure his daily need
He didn't mean to shoot the guard
But he was blinded by the greed

Oh Johnny

You see that nun, she's his sister
She doesn't know that he's gone bad
When they told it to his father
It drove the old man mad

Just as his mother warned him
From her dying bed
It's alright to lose your heart
But never lose your head

Oh Johnny

Now the cops have got him surrounded
And he doesn't stand a hope
He wonders how he could be in so much trouble
Over just a little dope

Five to one he gets away
That's the odds I'm going to give
Five to four they blast him away
Three to one he's going to live

Oh Johnny

Back in the alley where he was slain
I thought I heard something move
Beside the trash can lay a heart and chain
The picture had been removed

Just another juiced up junkie
Looking for a bed
It's alright to lose your heart
But never lose your head

Oh Johnny
