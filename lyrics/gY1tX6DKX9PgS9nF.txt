Cue the light, watch this show
Till you find the one you know
Aaaah, eyes wide, skin aflame
All you were is wiped away
All you love has died today

You stand by, You stand by,
You stand by, You stand by,
And let it happen

All you were is wiped away
All you love has died today
All you were is wiped away
All you love has died today

Run, you are a setting sun
Nighty night

Stand them up against the wall
Through the smoke the bodies fall
Aaaah, and the crowd seems appeased
All you were is wiped away
All you love has died today
You stand by, You stand by,
You stand by, You stand by,
And let it happen

All you were is wiped away
All you love has died today
All you were is wiped away
All you love has died today

Run, you are a setting sun
Nighty night
Run, you are a setting sun
Nighty night

You stand by, You stand by,
You stand by, You stand by,
And let it happen

Watch you come down, Oh, you're setting sun
Watch you come down, Oh, you're setting sun
Watch you come down, Oh, you're setting sun
Watch you come down, Oh, you're setting sun
