Fourth quarter baby
It's not over baby
And I'm not afraid of what I don't know
Its what I know that can be so hard to fight heeeeyy
But I'm gonna try
To hit the Game Winner
Baby I'm gonna try

You can count on it
(You can count on it)
Baby believe in me
Take a chance on me
Take a chance on me

Oh I'm ready to let it fly
I can make anything
I've been dreaming of this all my life
It would mean everything to me

To have the ball and hit the game winner
Oh take a chance on me
Give me the ball i'll hit the game winner
(You can count on it)
Anything can happen baby
People hug us we don't want it baby
