Light a candle for the sinners
Set the world on fire.

Anti choice and anti girl
I am the anti flag unfurled.
Anti white and anti man
I got the anti-future plan.
Anti fascist, anti mod
I am the anti-music god.
Anti sober, anti whore

There will never be enough of anti law.
I can't believe in the things
That don't believe in me!
Now it's your turn

To see what I hate about me
Anti people now you've gone too far

(Here's your) antichrist superstar
Anti money, anti hate
Anti things i fucked and ate
Anti cop and anti fun
Here is an anti-president gun
Anti Satan, anti black
The anti world is on my back
Anti gay and anti dope

I am the faggot anti-pope
I can't believe in the things
That don't believe in me
Now it's your turn

To see what I hate about me
Anti people now you've gone too far
Antichrist superstar
Anti people now you've gone too far

(Here's your) Antichrist superstar

This is where your faith is
Nothing Nothing Safe
Nothing Nothing Safe
Nothing Nothing Safe
Nothing Nothing Safe
Anti peace and anti life
Anti husband and anti wife
Anti song and anti me
I don't deserve a chance to be
Anti people now you've gone too far
Antichrist superstar
Anti people now you've gone too far
(Here's your) Antichrist superstar
