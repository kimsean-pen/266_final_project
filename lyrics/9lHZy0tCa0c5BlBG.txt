Don't say that you're nice to me alright
You're lying
Don't say that you'll be with me tonight
You're lying
Don't think I forgot what you said
Implying
There's nothing there and it's dead

In your heart

Don't say I'm not nice to you tonight
I'm trying
Don't say I'm not in love with you alright
I'm crying
Don't say that you'll be with me again
You're lying
There's nothing there and it's dead

In your heart
