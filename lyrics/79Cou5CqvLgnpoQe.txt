In a world
Where people have problems
In this world
Where decisions are a way of life
Other people's problems
They overwhelm my mind
They say compassion is a virtue
But I don't have the time

So many people have their problems
I'm not interested in their problems
I guess I've experienced some problems
But now I've made some decisions

It takes a lot of time
To push away the nonsense
Take my compassion
Push it as far as it goes
My interest level's dropping
My interest level is dropping
I've heard all I want to, and I
Don't want to hear any more

What are you, in
Love with your problems?
I think you take it
A little too far, it's
Not so cool to have
So many problems
But don't expect me
To explain your indecisions

Go talk to your analysts
Isn't that what they're paid for?
Ooh, you, you walk, you talk
You still function like you used to
Ooh, it's not a question
Of your personality or style
Be a little more selfish
It might do you some good

In a world
Where people have problems
In this world
Where decisions are a way of life
Other people's problems
They overwhelm my mind
They say compassion is a virtue
But I don't have the time

Here we go again
