Where were you when I needed heat?
I'm frozen! Gotta get myself up
And believe I'm broken
Swim forward, we're underwater
She took your breath away
Tell me, love
Thought you said you'd die for me?!

No heavy rain's gonna hold me down anymore
Nothing to shame's gonna strain myself, oh no
Another day I'm the shine in your eyes
Another day's gonna hold my head up high
Higher higher higher (my head up),
Higher higher higher (my head up),
Higher higher higher (my head up),
Higher higher higher higher higher

One day was all it took for us, to fall apart
Ship sinking with my heavy heart
Come rescue us!
I stay strong, bite them word son my tongue
Lights flash, you walk away
Laughs will be, got no room for hating me

No heavy rain's gonna hold me down anymore
Nothing to shame's gonna strain myself, oh no
Another day I'm the shine in your eyes
Another day's gonna hold my head up high
Higher higher higher (my head up)
Higher higher higher (my head up)
Higher higher higher (my head up)
Higher higher higher higher higher

All these times I told myself
Inseparable, but the time will tell
Nothing is said in stone
I left when in control
All these nights I beg for rest
Spend it in two in wilderness
Nothing is said in stone
Turn my back, hit the road.

No heavy rain's gonna hold me down anymore
Nothing to shame's gonna strain myself, oh no
Another day I'm the shine in your eyes
Another day's gonna hold my head up high
Higher higher higher (my head up)
Higher higher higher (my head up)
Higher higher higher (my head up)
Higher higher higher higher higher
