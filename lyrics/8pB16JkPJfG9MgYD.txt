Aquabats, The
Myths, Legends And Other Amazing Adventures, Vol. 2
Hey Luno!
Look at you
And if i wanted to,
I could see someone in there
Who'd like to be the happiest clam on the beach

But look at you
You're the angry clown
Trying to push all the kids around
But there's a flying horse that could change that course

Hey hey hey!
Hey luno!
Hey hey hey!
Hey luno!

Can he stop the enemy?
-we only believe in what we see!
But he can do it, you never know
-but we don't know!

Hey hey hey!
Hey luno!
Hey hey hey!
Hey luno!

Why can't you just call his name?
Then luno could come down
And take you far away to the land of the same
Then you'll see how fun it is
That flying horse is true
And you're stuck in a world with people just as sad as you

Can he stop the enemy?
-we only believe in what we see!
But he can do it, you never know
-but we don't know!

Just call his name
And he will come
The flying horse
LunoÂ¡

Hey hey hey!
Hey luno!
