Now that you've gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams i hold
Is a band of gold
And the memory
Of what love could be
If you wee
Still here with me
You took me from the shelter of my lover i had never known
Or loved any other
We killed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms

I waited in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'd walk back through that door
And love me
Like you tried before

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams i hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were still here with me

Instrumental

Don't you know that i'd wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'd walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left
Is a band of gold
And the dream of
What love could be
If you were still here with me

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left
Is a band of gold
And the dream of
What love could be
If you were still here with me
