We don't have to try
To think the same thoughts
We just have a way
Of knowing everything's gonna be okay
We'll laugh 'til we cry
Read each other's minds
Live with a smile
Make it all worthwhile
Make it all worthwhile

Life has moments hard to describe
Feeling great and feeling alive
Never coming down from this mountain we're on

Always knowing we're gonna be fine
Feeling great and feeling alive
Never coming down from this mountain we're on
The feeling's so clear and it's crazy up here
Life is amazing with you on the ride

We don't wanna sleep
Just wanna stay up
There's so much to say
And not enough hours in the day
We'll laugh 'til we cry
Read each other's minds
Live with a smile
Make it all worthwhile
Make it all worthwhile

Life has moments hard to describe
Feeling great and feeling alive
Never coming down from this mountain we're on

Always knowing we're gonna be fine
Feeling great and feeling alive
Never coming down from this mountain we're on
The feeling's so clear and it's crazy up here
Life is amazing with you on the ride
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

We try be lazy
The journey is perfect
The place is so crazy
The race is so worth it
I will be with you
We'll do this together
Always together

Life has moments hard to describe
Feeling great and feeling alive
Never coming down from this mountain we're on (mountain we're on)

Always knowing we're gonna be fine
Feeling great and feeling alive
Never coming down from this
Never coming down, never coming down, never coming down (from this)

Always knowing were gonna be fine
Feeling great and feeling alive
Never coming down from this mountain were on
(never coming down from this, mountain we're on)

The feeling's so clear and it's crazy up here
Life is amazing with you on the ride
The place so is crazy
The race is so worth it
Life is amazing with you on the ride
