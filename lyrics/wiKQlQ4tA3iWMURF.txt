Give notice, give away
Your personal property
Your illusions
Killing you dead
You deserve peace of mind for yourself

Southern California
Let's go!
There's room for all

There ain't nothing for it
What else can you do
Nothing to work with
Nothing to lose
It is what it is
It ain't gonna improve
Nothing to work with
Nothing to lose
Take it or leave it
Do both if you choose

Your patrons/your guests
Manufactured phonies
Hung up on themselves
Bring 'em all with you
It's all for the best
'Cause we got space out
Here in the west

Southern California
Let's go!
There's room for all

There ain't nothing for it
What else can you do
Nothing to work with
Nothing to lose
It is what it is
It ain't gonna improve
Nothing to work with
Nothing to lose
Take it or leave it
Do both if you choose
