The one go down is alive
It is part of my flight
The one inside makes a sign
And keeps an eye to the light
I sense panic overboard
Obscure, viscid sprawling fog
I hear a sonar rumour
That says I'm far from the shore

How I am stricken with non-emotion
It crawls up above
Persicopic cognition
WHere it strives to dwell
In abnormal contortion
I navigate in my maze
Investigate to be safe safe safe

Across the ocean
Of sheer compromise
There is no matrix
Not even a guide
The last wave of sanity
Rolls over my frequency
Skyline under water field
The depths above the high seas

A twilight house keeper
Dim-on, dim-off now
A concrete cyclops
Blinking down his dull eye
Does this code signal
Something somewhere somehow?
Why me? It goes on and on and on

Please no
Too late for S.O.S.
Mute island, fish-eye view
Circling the border line
No resource, no rescue
I'm stranded, I'm otherwise
The error is perfect
Like this sub-effect
Of my mind... my mind
