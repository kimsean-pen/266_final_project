It's the birth of a star, earlier than sunset
It's the galaxy swollen, flowing like a river babe
It's the rain, oh the rain
Drawn upon this on my day
Growing into a super nova
Back to where we used to play
It's an infinity, as I feast on time
'Cause it constantly leams perpetual desire
'Cause we worship the keeper
The tide is going out now
As we look out to see
Legs sprawled and head down

Yes they shine bright like a million,
Let them blink twice for a minute
Pleasure to have met you, you're my star tonight
To have felt this oh sublime
Like a grain of sand travelling through time
Pleasure to have met you, you're my star tonight
Yes they shine bright like a million
Let them blink twice for a minute
Pleasure to have met you, you're my star tonight
To have felt this oh sublime
Like a grain of sand travelling through time
Pleasure to have met you, you're my star tonight

We don't see eye to eye
We don't see eye to eye
We don't see eye to eye
We don't see eye to eye

The time it took to realise
What you say bears sweet on my soul
Compliments with no surprises
Making route straight to their home

We don't see eye to eye
We don't see eye to eye
We don't see eye to eye
We don't see eye to eye

Rusty man should improve this
Not quite opting fury now
Complications falling useless
Alone and still I'm working out

We don't see eye to eye
We don't see eye to eye
We don't see eye to eye
We don't see eye to eye
