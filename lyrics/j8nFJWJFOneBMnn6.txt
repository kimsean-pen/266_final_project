You have eyes that lead me on
And a body that shows me death
Your lips look like they were made
For something else but they just suck my breath
I want your pain to taste why you're ashamed
And I know you're not just what you say to me
And I'm not the only moment you're made of

You're so sudden and sweet all legs, knuckle, knees
Head's blown clean off your mouth's paid off
Fuck me 'til we know it's unsafe and we'll paint over the evidence

I want you wanting me
I want what I see in your eyes
So give me something to be scared of
Don't give me something to satisfy

You're so sudden and sweet all legs, knuckle, knees
Head's blown clean off your mouth's paid off
Fuck me 'til we know it's unsafe and we'll paint over the evidence

I want your pain to taste why you're ashamed
And I know you're not just what you say to me
And I'm not the only moment you're made of

You're so sudden and sweet all legs, knuckle, knees
Head's blown clean off your mouth's paid off
Fuck me 'til we know it's unsafe and we'll paint over the evidence
You're so sudden and sweet all legs, knuckle, knees
Head's blown clean off your mouth's paid off
Fuck me 'til we know it's unsafe and we'll paint over the evidence
