We took a trip down in '87
We were looking for a place where we don't fear heaven
Yeah, we got some guns, got some dogs
But just like them dogs, well those guns just get bigger.

Looking to the town to show us what they got,
We'll take it to the cabin and we'll show ya what we got.
We got space to do what you please.
If you'll ever make it out.

If I never stand at another corner trying hard to be a father
Let's be, let's be love.
If I never need again I'll find that sleep again,
Let's be, let's be love.
We took a trip down in '87
We were looking for a place where we don't need heaven.
Oh, once you crawl in you'll never come back again.
Oh, once you crawl in you'll never come back again.

If I never stand at another corner trying hard to be a father
Let's be, let's be love.
If I never need again I'll find that sleep again,
Let's be, let's be love.

Though I never pray God reigns today.
Though I never pray God reigns today.
Though I never pray God reigns today.
Though I never pray God reigns today.

And if you catch us coming up around the bend.
And if we step a little higher will we find it then?
There's gotta be something roaming up around the bend.

Oh, once you crawl in you'll never come back again.
Oh, once you crawl in you'll never come back again.

Though I never pray God reigns today.
Though I never pray God reigns today.
Though I never pray God reigns today.
Though I never pray God reigns today.
