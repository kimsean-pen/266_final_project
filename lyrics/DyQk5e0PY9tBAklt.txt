Oh I was in the dark age
Searching for the ones in my mind
I'm so far away
But I had hit the ground running
Steady as you go I don't mind
I'm still here today

Oh Spouting hymns and buzzing rhymes
And forever talking when it ain't so kind
But it feels like forever on the run
When your mind turns to fiction

I had took the long way
I was in the heat I don't mind
I'm so far away
But it feels like forever on the run
When your mind turns to fiction
Oh Nudging the ghost from the skull
And a night without sleep
Vibration comes
First to the head and last to the feet
Spouting hymns and buzzing rhymes
And forever talking when it ain't so kind
But it feels like forever on the run
When your mind turns to fiction
