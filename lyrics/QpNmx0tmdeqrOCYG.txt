Imagine yourself walking along an old road
The sun is warm on your back
The air is calm
As you progress down the road
You find yourself in an overgrown garden
As you walk behind the garden you come to a wooded area
Where the trees become denser
The air feels mild and a bit cooler
Soon you come upon a brook
You follow the path along the brook for a way
The path takes you out into a sunlit clearing
Where you discover a small and picturesque waterfall
There is a rainbow in the mist
