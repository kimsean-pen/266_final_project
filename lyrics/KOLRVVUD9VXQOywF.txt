I said her love is my religion
It's my religion, it's my religion, it's my religion

Some have their Bibles and some go to church
Well, I found my heaven inside of her

We only talked until believe
Gotta find our destiny
I've got her and she's got me
I see her when I close my eyes
She's my only God in life
Never gonna say goodbye

'Cause I see the stars in the freckles on her face
And I'm seein' God every time she says my name
So Mother Mary, pray for me
Without her, I'm so lost, her love is my religion

Some have their crosses and their golden gates
Well, she is the grace I wear when I lose my faith

We only talked until believe
The words we say before we sleep
Close my eyes and she's my dream
She's the truth inside the world of lies
Keeping all my hope alive
Never going to say goodbye

'Cause I see the stars in the freckles on her face
And I'm seein' God every time she says my name
So Mother Mary, pray for me
Without her I'm so lost, her love is my religion

Her love is my religion
Is my religion, is my religion
I said her love is my religion
Is my religion, is my religion
I said her love is my religion
Is my religion, is my religion

'Cause I see the stars in the freckles on her face
And I'm seein' God every time she says my name
So Mother Mary, pray for me
Without her I'm so lost, her love is my religion

I said her love is my religion
Is my religion, is my religion
I said her love is my religion
Is my religion, is my religion, is my religion
