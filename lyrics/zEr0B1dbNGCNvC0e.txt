Excuse me, can you tell me what you've heard about my life?
Maybe a dirty little fairy tale, a girl of the night
I've heard that I grew up filthy, a trailer park queen
Dropout, pregnant, statistical teen

I know you've heard about the bloody knife
About my daddy's perfect virgin and my mothers wife
You know I heard I don't belong in this game
Still you hold your hands in the air, screaming my name, LET'S GO!

Baby go ahead, I'll be your hatred and your pain

This is killing us all, I don't care if I fall we're the daring, we are the damned.
Baby go ahead, I'll be the villain you can blame
I'll be the belle of the brawl, be the lust in us all

I'm the diva of the damned.
I heard I don't belong in this scene

Sex metal barbie, homicidal queen
Excuse me, can you tell me what was the thing you heard about me?
Maybe that I'm a little harlot, homicidal queen
You know I heard that I don't belong in this scene

Sex metal barbie, whore, attention fiend
You know I heard that that my hater's dream
No class, white trash, I'm so obscene
You know I heard that I should be ashamed

Still they hold their fists in the air, screaming my name, COME ON!
Baby go ahead, I'll be your hatred and your pain

This is killing us all, I don't care if I fall we're the daring, we are the damned.
Baby go ahead, I'll be the villain you can blame
I'll be the belle of the brawl, be the lust in us all

I'm the diva of the damned.
I heard I don't belong in this scene

Sex metal barbie, homicidal queen
Sex Sex (sex metal barbie, homicidal queen)

sex sex (sex metal barbie, homicidal queen)
So go ahead, I'll be your hatred and your pain
This is killing us all, I don't care if I fall, we are the daring we are the damned.
Baby go ahead, I'll be the villain you can blame
I'll be the belle of the brawl, be the lust in us all
I'm the diva of the damned.
Sex sex (Go ahead)
Sex sex (Go ahead)
Sex sex (Go ahead)
Sex sex (Go ahead)
I heard I don't belong in this scene
Sex metal barbie, homicidal queen
