Don't come too close.
Don't try and know me cuz there's nothing to know.
Wind me up and let me go.
I've got a headache again.
I've got all day to waste and an empty bed.
My head won't stop turning.
My head won't stop turning on me.
Dreamed I was functioning.
Faded in the daylight.
Can't understand anything.
Has the spinning gotten strange?
