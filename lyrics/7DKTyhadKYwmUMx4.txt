You are killing me
And everything you love about me
You're making it harder and harder and harder on me
And you ain't telling me
Telling me much that you love me
Anymore

I don't look before I leap
Then I drag you in with me
And you just can't seem to take it anymore
And so you're killing me
What I knew used to be
Just don't fly here anymore
So you're making you some changes
You should have made before you started killing me

You are killing me
And everything you love about me
You're making it harder and harder and harder on me
And you ain't telling me
Telling me much that you love me
Anymore

I don't look before I leap
Then I drag you in with me
And you just can't seem to take it anymore
And so you're killing me
What I knew used to be
Just don't fly here anymore
So you're making you some changes
You should have made before you started killing me

Cause I don't, and I don't, and I don't
Ah man I don't
And that's why you're killing me
