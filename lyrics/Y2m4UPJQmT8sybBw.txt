Face down on a broken street
There's a man in the corner
In a pool of misery
I'm in white van

As a red sea covers the ground
Metal crash
I can't tell what it is
But I take a look

And now I'm sorry I did
5: 30 on a Friday night
Thirty three good people cut down
I don't believe anymore

I don't believe anymore
Face down on a pillow of shame
There are some girls with a needle
Tryin' to spell my name

My body's not a canvas
My body's now a toilet wall
I don't believe anymore
I don't believe anymore

Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves

Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes
You disappear

Running wild
Running wild

Boy sees his father
Crushed under the weight
Of a cross in a passion

Where the passion is hate
Blue mink Ford
I'm gonna detonate in your den

Blood in the house
Blood on the street
The worst things in the world
Are justified by belief

Registration 1385-WZ
I don't believe anymore
I don't believe anymore

Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves

We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear

If I open my eyes
You disappear
Running wild
