Call me whenever you feel the moon
네가 어디든
I'll be there for you
지금 어디야 달이 이뻐서
I just wanna know
I just wanna go

Baby 널 더 원해
조금 더 깊게
나를 만져줘
Yeah we keep our dancing
'Till the morning
어루만져 줘

I've been looking 'bout you girl
아직 밤은 남았어
아무 말 필요 없어

Tell me with your bodytalk
Tell me with your bodytalk
Tell me with your bodytalk
Tell me with your bodytalk
Tell me with your bodytalk
Tell me with your bodytalk
Tell me with your bodytalk

Hold me whenever you feel the moon
밤은 깊었고
I'm high 넌 어때
머릿속은
All of you my baby
Let me be your something
Let me take your something

눈이 마주쳤을 때
미소를 짓네
We know what we want
점점 가까워질 때
무슨 말이 더 필요해
We take what we want

I've been looking 'bout you girl
아직 밤은 남았어
아무 말 필요 없어

Tell me with your bodytalk
Tell me with your bodytalk
Tell me with your bodytalk
Tell me with your bodytalk
Tell me with your bodytalk
Tell me with your bodytalk
Tell me with your bodytalk
