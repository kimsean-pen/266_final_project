Pure hearts stumble
In my hands they crumble
Fragile and stripped to the core
I can't hurt you anymore

Loved by numbers
You're losing life's wonder
Touch like strangers detached
I can't feel you anymore

The sunshine trapped in our hearts
It could rise again
But I'm lost
Crushed
Cold and confused with
No guiding light left inside
You were my guiding light

When comfort
And warmth can't be found
I still reach for you
But I'm lost
Crushed
Cold and confused with
No guiding light left inside

You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light
When there's no guiding light left inside
When there's no guiding light in our lives
