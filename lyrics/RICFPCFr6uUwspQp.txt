Stumbling forward in knee-deep snow
The wind is whipping my face in frozen slashes

Void of direction... void of hope...
I call her name... in the whiteout...

There amidst the raging coldness, I catch her figure
The fear of death is staring at me through her eyes

Through the wind's howl, a scream now rises
Something moves in the whirl of snow
Creatures born out of winter's furor
Closing in on us

Through the cave's mouth, a crack in the stone wall
I'm tearing my way right into the dark
A beast is rending the ground behind me
Kiiling all the light

Hear the grinding... of stone against stone...
I'm crawling deeper... in the dark...
