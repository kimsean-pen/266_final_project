Hellish noises follow you
The world is closing in you're sensing doom
Footsteps dragging heavily
Not ready to meet eternity

Blind man following close behind
Begging you to spare a dime
But you know he wants you dead
As you shove your fingers into his head

Eye sockets penetrated by your hand
Innocent blood is spill
But you have stopped his plan

Running fast to escape
The scream of sirens call your name
Bloody corpse left on the street
Police pig vomits uncontrollably

See the old woman from the corner of your eye
Why does she want to make you die?
End it fast with a knife in her gut
Better to spill hers instead of your blood

Hear her gasping as you flee
Impending dread, you will never be free
