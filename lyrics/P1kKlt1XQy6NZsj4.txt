I know what you want to do
And my heart's racing
Oh I want to give it up to you
We've been wanting this for so long
You keep insisting
Now we're only here for one night alone

Girl let's take it slow, baby can we take it slow
(We Got to get on it on)
(Got to got to get to on)
Girl let's take it slow, baby can we take it slow
(We Got to get on it on)
(Got to got to get to on)

I took my time to get you
So how could I ever forget you
When you're all I know
Feels right when we're with each other
I'm home when I'm with my lover
Something new to me
Something new to me

Girl we got it all figured out, laying down, making faces on the edges of your couch
Loving feels so wonderful with you
Have I told you everything's been
going right since the day I met you

Girl we got it all figured out, laying down, making faces on the edges of your couch
Loving feels so wonderful with you
Have I told you everything's been
going right since the day I met you

Girl let's take it slow, baby can we take it slow
(We Got to get on it on)
(Got to got to get to on)
Girl let's take it slow, baby can we take it slow
(We Got to get on it on)
(Got to got to get to on)
