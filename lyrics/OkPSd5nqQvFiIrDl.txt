Was in a place where I wished for the love of my life
I've suffered more in these arms and I thought I would die
And now I tremble on the brink like a shivering child
Praying that the fall if it hurts will be worth the flight

If I blow it, I'll know it
I'll face it with my open broken heart and my wiser eyes
If I blow it, so goes it
I won't regret a thing I did just the things I didn't try

Choose what you love most
And let it kill you if you have to
Choose what you love most
And let it kill you
Let it kill you

My freedom waits to surrender and give you my life
I fear that I'm over my head but I'm digging the dive
I'll take a breath with the kiss of death if I survive
And know with the next breath I'm immortalized

If I blow it, I'll know it
I'll face it with my open broken heart and my wiser eyes
If I blow it, so goes it
I won't regret a thing I did just the things I didn't try

Choose what you love most
And let it kill you if you have to
Choose what you love most
And let it kill you
Let it kill you

And let it kill you
Let it kill you
Choose what you love most
And let it kill you
Let it kill you
Let it kill you
Let it kill you
