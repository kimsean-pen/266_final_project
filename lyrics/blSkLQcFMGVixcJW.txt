I'll break your heart
to keep you far from where
all dangers start
and atmosphere
gets crazy light
where every breath just bites
into the soft
space of calm about you

They call me a thief
They call me a thief
Call me a thief
Call me a thief
Common thief
Common thief
Common thief
Call me
Call me

I know that you're not here, that you're not here
Sort of lost without you
I hope that you'll find all there is that you want
is inside you now

I'll break your heart
to keep you far from where
all danger starts
I'm on my way
I'm on my way down

I know that you're not, that you're not here
Sort of lost without you
I hope that you find all there is that you want
is inside you now
Now...

I know that
You're not here
I wonder where you are

In the dark we are waiting for you
With your dying need for their attention
Hold on tight now, we won't let you fall

We are waiting for you
With your dying need for their attention
Hold on tight now, we won't let you fall...
