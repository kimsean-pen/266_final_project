I had a dream that the sun in the sky
Was feeling so lonely, he started to cry
The rain on our windows kept us inside
All of the morning, and into the night

Alone in my dream room, I want to love you
Alone in my dream room, my body above you

I'm just a man on the moon
I'm not coming down anytime soon
I'm just a man on the moon
Feet off the ground, I'm floating in you

Nobody saw us for seven days
Under the covers, your body amazed
I couldn't believe that, deep down inside
Two bodies glowing could light up the sky

Alone in my dream room, I want to love you
Alone in my dream room, my body above you

I'm just a man on the moon
I'm not coming down anytime soon
I'm just a man on the moon
Feet off the ground, I'm floating in you

I'm in your dreams now
I'm in your dreams now
I'm in your dreams now
I'm in your dreams, in your dreams, in your dreams
I'm in your dreams now
I'm in your dreams now
I'm in your dreams now
I'm in your dreams, in your dreams, in your dreams
I'm in your dreams now
I'm in your dreams now
I'm in your dreams now
I'm in your dreams, in your dreams, in your dreams
I'm in your dreams now
I'm in your dreams now
I'm in your dreams now
(Feet off the ground)
I'm in your dreams, in your dreams, in your dreams
(I'm floating in you)
I'm in your dreams now
I'm in your dreams now
I'm in your dreams now
(Feet off the ground)
I'm in your dreams, in your dreams, in your dreams
(I'm floating in you)
I'm in your dreams now
(Feet off the ground)
I'm in your dreams now
(I'm floating in you)
I'm in your dreams now
(Feet off the ground)
I'm in your dreams, in your dreams, in your dreams
(I'm floating in you)
