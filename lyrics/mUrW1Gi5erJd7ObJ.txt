Derulo

It's too hot to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor
Nothing on me
And I can't take it no more

It's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door
Where are my keys?
'Cause I gotta leave, yeah

In the back of the cab
I tip the driver 'head of time
Get me there fast
I got your body on my mind

I want it bad
Oh, just the thought of you
Gets me so high
So high

Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me girl you got me
There's nothing I no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you

Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me girl you got me
There's nothing I no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Just to get up next to you

You open the door
Wearing nothing but a smile
Down to the floor
And you whisper in my ear

"Baby I'm yours"
Oh, just the thought of you
Gets me so high
So high

Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me girl you got me
There's nothing I no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you

Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me girl you got me
There's nothing I no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Just to get up next to you
Just the thought of you

Gets me so high
So high
Oh, just the thought of you
Gets me so high
So high

Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me girl you got me
There's nothing I no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you

Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me girl you got me
There's nothing I no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you

I would do anything
Just to get up next to you
Anything and everything
Just to get up next to you

Just to get up next to you

Get up, get up
