No, think you got your break
I'm no sugar mama
I'm no piggy bank
Tell me what you think, nah, nah, nah
Stackin' bills and counting change
I'm no Rockefeller
I'm not what you think
No way, nah, nah, nah

I'm your new money
Drop it all on your crew
Spent too soon money
One percent I'm at the top of this earth money
That's what I'm worth, honey
That's what I'm worth, worth, worth

I am a diamond
And diamonds are forever
My love is timeless
'Cause diamonds are forever
Oh no, no
Money don't buy class
And I can't be bought like that, like that
I am a diamond
And diamonds are forever

Steal my heart, and steal my kiss
But you can't shake my balances
There's no can do, nah, nah, nah
No can do, nah, nah, nah
And I'll take you out
And I'll take you in
This love is my weakness, nah, nah

I'm your new money
Drop it all on your crew
Spent too soon money
One percent I'm at the top of this earth money
That's what I'm worth, honey
That's what I'm worth, worth, worth

I am a diamond (diamond babe)
And diamonds are forever (oh they're forever, ever)
My love is timeless
'Cause diamonds are forever
Money don't buy class (don't buy class, nah, nah)
And I can't be bought like that, like that
I am a diamond
And diamonds are forever

Ohh, no, no, no, babe (diamonds, diamonds)
(Diamonds, diamonds)
Oh, no, they're forever, baby (diamonds, diamonds)
What ya gonna do for me darlin' (diamonds, diamonds)

I guess you want me to
Give up these diamonds to you

I am a diamond
And diamonds are forever
My love is timeless
'Cause diamonds are forever
(No, they're forever, no, you know)
Money don't buy class
And I can't be bought like that, like that
I am a diamond
And diamonds are forever

(Diamonds, diamonds)
Diamonds baby, diamonds, oh, no
(Diamonds, diamonds)
Know your love, those diamonds are yours
(Diamonds, diamonds)
(Diamonds, diamonds)

I guess you want me to
Give up these diamonds to you
