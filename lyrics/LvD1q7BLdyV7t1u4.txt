Sometimes the stars I see are bright.
Somewhere above the clouds at night.
Some shine the light of starlight.
Somewhere above the cloudless sky.

With you.

With you.

Sometimes the stars I see are bright.
Somewhere above the clouds at night.
Thinking about outside,
And walking around and around.

Some shine the light of starlight.
So far above the cloudless sky.
I'm thinking of outside,
Walking around and around.

Well love is a powerful thing,
They need love inside you,
Deep down in my heart in light of you.
Well maybe the stars are dying to tell you.

Well love is a powerful thing,
They need love inside you,
Deep down in my heart in light of you.
Well maybe the stars are dying to tell you.

With you, with you, with you, with you.
With you, with you, with you, with you.
With you, with you, with you, with you.
With you, with you, with you, with you.
With you.
With you.
With you.
With you.
With you.

Each time the light of the starlight,
Turns black, black with the dark of night.
I'm thinking about stuff,
Walking around and around.

Some shine the light of starlight.
So far above the cloudless sky.
I'm thinking about stuff,
Walking around and around.

Well love is a powerful thing,
They need love inside you,
Deep down in my heart in light of you.
Well maybe the stars are dying to tell you.

Well love is a powerful thing,
They need love inside you,
Deep down in my heart in light of you.
Well maybe the stars are dying to tell you.

With you, with you, with you, with you.
With you, with you, with you, with you.
With you, with you, with you, with you.
With you, with you, with you, with you.
With you.
With you.
With you.
With you.

*Inaudible*

Well love is a powerful thing,
They need love inside you,
Deep down in my heart in light of you.
Well maybe the stars are dying to tell you.

With you.
