Did I see you the other day?
Grey eyes looked so grey...
Bitten once with indecision
I could run all the way...
I turned around
To see the sound
And watched the world explode in the sky
But when I look straight at you...
I'm livin a deja vu
There's nothin else to do...
We've got nothing left to lose, yeah
For and for the fantasy
We bear it the same everyday
Our lives are shaped by the ones who say
There are no reaons for your mistakes
When I saw you the other day
You made your mark on me
I can wait for a million years
But will you wait for me?
You feel the heat and you feel the need
As I watched them collide in your eyes
You could run away, but what's the use?
You're livin a deja vu
There's nothin else to do...
We've got nothing left to lose...
We've got nothing left to lose...
We've got nothing left to lose...
Please don't say not a single thing...
Nothing but words, anyway
Is this just a blind obsession...
Or was it destiny?
Let's stick around my secret ground
And watch the world spin into sand
You could run away, but what's the use?
You're livin a deja vu
There's nothin else to do...
We've got nothing left to lose...
We've got nothing left to lose...
We've got nothing left to lose...
We've got nothing left to lose...
We've got nothing left to lose...
We've got nothing left to lose...
We've got nothing left to lose...
We've got nothing left to lose...
