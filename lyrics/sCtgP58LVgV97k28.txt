Ooh a smile is more than showing teeth
Ooh it's not the potion, it's the magic that I seek

Every tear disappears
Every tear disappears

Every moment I struggle I'm deeper in the pit
If I can show a hand, then I can show a fist
Call the 21st century, tell her give herself a break

Every tear disappears
Every tear disappears

Oh and what about the pain?
Don't ask me how, I just know that it fades

And hey, hey, hey
Every tear disappears
Every eye can see you now

Yeah, I live unwise
Yeah, I've been born twice

Yeah, I live unwise
Yeah, I've been born twice

Yeah, I live unwise
Yeah, I've been born twice

Yeah, I live unwise
Yeah, I've been born twice

Yeah, I live unwise
Yeah, I've been born twice

Yeah, I live unwise
Yeah, I've been born twice

Yeah, I live unwise
Yeah, I've been born twice

Yeah, I live unwise
Yeah, I've been born twice

Yeah, I live unwise
Yeah, I've been born twice
