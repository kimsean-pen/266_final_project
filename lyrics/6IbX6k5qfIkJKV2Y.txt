Three little birds
Sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon
So sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete
Maybe sometimes

We got it wrong
But it's all right
The more things seem to change
More they stay the same
Ooh

Don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song
You go ahead
Let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans

I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere
Somehow

Blue as the sky
Sombre and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the road side
(just relax, just relax)

Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo
Maybe sometimes
We feel afraid
But it's all right
The more you stay the same
The more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere
Somehow

Just more than I could take
Pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake
I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realise
That you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Ooh, You're gonna find yourself somewhere
Somehow
