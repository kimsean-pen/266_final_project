You're undecided
You ride a fence but that fence divides
No side is still a side

A look in your eyes says
I hold myself above you
You can't see through skin

Hey, don't think that I ain't counting
All the things, all the things you do
I'll hold a flood lamp to you
And burn you in your awful truth

Born without a choice of race
Held to blame and put in place
See through the skin
And look at all that lies within

I know that this can't cure it
But if it bends and ear then hear it
You, watch what you do
Watch what you do

You've gotta unlearn it
It's a sickness that keeps returning
You need open heart

Enough of your joking
You're gonna wind up choking
Some words still can kill

Hey, what kind of friend would understand a joke
Could stand a joke so cruel?
Hey, color's just another number
Tattooed with a blunt old tool

Born without a choice of race
Held to blame and put in place
See through the skin
And look at all that lies within

I know that this can't cure it
But if it bends and ear then hear it
You, watch what you do
Watch what you do
