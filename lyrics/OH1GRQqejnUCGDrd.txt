It's so good when it's sunny
Yeah, it's easy and bright
And you're good with your money
I feel so light, feel so light
When it's constantly heavy
And the shadows come 'round
We will never be ready
'Til all fall down, all fall down

Holding on tightly and closing the door
Just keeps us bright and we deserve more
Open our eyes to what lays in store
Cause we can't afford 'til we save anymore

There's a warning coming in
Storm coming overhead
Stop lying in your bed
There's nowhere to hide
There's lightning in the sky
Storm coming in the night
Stop running, stand and fight
Hold your head high

Hold your head high
Hold, hold your head high
Hold your head high
Hold, hold your head high
Hold your head high
Hold, hold your head high, high, high, high, high
Hold your head high

Hold your head high
Hold your head high

It's so good when it's sunny
Yeah, it's easy and bright
And you're good with your money
I feel so light, feel so light
When it starts to get heavy
And the shadows come 'round
We will never be ready
'Til all fall down, all fall down

Holding on tightly and closing the door
Just keeps us bright and we deserve more
Open our eyes to what lays in store
Cause we can't afford 'til we save anymore

There's a warning coming in
Storm coming overhead
Stop lying in your bed
There's nowhere to hide
There's lightning in the sky
Storm coming in the night
Stop running, stand and fight
Hold your head high

Hold your head high
Hold, hold your head high
Hold your head high
Hold, hold your head high
Hold your head high
Hold, hold your head high, high, high, high, high
Hold your head high

Hold your head high
Hold your head high

There's a warning coming in
Storm coming overhead
Stop lying in your bed
There's nowhere to hide
There's lightning in the sky
Storm coming in, in the night
Stop running, stand and fight
Hold your head high

Hold your head high
Hold, hold your head high
Hold your head high
Hold, hold your head high
Hold your head high
Hold, hold your head high
Hold your head high
Hold, hold your head high
