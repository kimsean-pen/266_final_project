(Go)

(yeea, yea)

(one, two)

All these games you play your messin with my head
(Your messin with my head)
And I dont know why I stay I should leave instead
(Should leave instead)
When I speak from my heart you laugh like its a game
(Well this aint no game)
Yea we make great friends but it just isnt the same

And I know this is not the way it should be
And I know you treat him like me
(Bedu, bedu, bedu, bedu)
But I dont
I wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop

No I don't need you to buy me pretty things
(You don't pay for me)
Pay for my tattoos or buy me diamond rings
(We don't want those things)
But all I know is that I'm happy to see you smile
(Wanna see you smile)
And it make my day if you would just stay for awhile
(Won't you stay with me?)

And I know this is not the way it should be
And I know you treat him like me
(Bedu, bedu, bedu, bedu)
But I dont
I wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop

This gone on for way too long
And I'm tired of moving on
This gone on for way too long.
This gone on for way too long
And I'm tired of movin on.
This gone on for way too long

And I know this is not the way it should be
And I know you treat him like me
(Bedu, bedu, bedu, bedu)
But I don't
Wanna stop
