i am fire I am damage in the making
i am an army set out to control your every ticking
i am a giant stepping on the tiny world you live in

and you shake and you shiver
as the roof is coming down
and the walls grow thinner

shadowshow darkens the river
turn hearts into stone
we run we run terrified what have we done
is this how it goes
silence grows loudly bigger
it's heartrending crow
you run you run
terrified what have you done?
is this how it goes
it's how it goes

mass confusion never been so excited
what your hearts felt for us was evidently unrequited

and by the sea we're laying down our hopes
you will conquer all
your rise our fall
and by the sea
i'm laying down my hopes
we will conquer all
our rise your fall

and i shake and i shiver as i cut through skin and bone
can you solve the riddle

shadowshow darkens the river
turn hearts into stone
we run we run terrified what have we done
is this how it goes
silence grows loudly bigger
it's heartrending crow
you run you run
terrified what have you done?
is this how it goes
it's how it goes

i am fire i am damage in the making
i am an army set out to control your every ticking
