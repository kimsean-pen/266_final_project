Through your eyes I fight for gravity
A place to stand and a place to breathe
When the walls begin to shake in the home you thought you knew
Will you run? Will you stay? Will you choose?

Do you know who I am?
I'm so afraid you'll never understand
There's a part of me still lost out there
And I just want to know
Yeah I just want to know
Am I becoming a hologram?

Close your eyes from the darker side of things
A shade of grey hidden under sheets

When the walls begin to shake in the home you thought you know
Will you run? Will you stay? Will you choose?

Do you know who I am?
I'm so afraid you'll never understand
There's a part of me still lost out there
And I just want to know
Yeah I just want to know
Am I a part of the hologram?

Now I think I'm worried that I'm in too deep
Like a phantom that you'll never see
So I just want to know
Yeah I just want to know
Am I a part of the hologram?
