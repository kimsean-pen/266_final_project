I'll never understand
The love you gave me
When you came into this land
You came to save me

You died
To save my life

I can finally see
You opened up my eyes
So now I can believe
I finally realize
I'm free
Because you love me

I used to be afraid in the dark,
But now I'm running into the light

Never looking back
I'm on the right track
There's nothing that can change my mind
I'm done with all this games
I'll never be the same
I've got my eyes on the prize

Your love has changed me
So I'll sing it at the top of my lungs
My life has just began

Never looking back
Never looking back

I wanna show the world
This light inside of me
I'm ready to expose
My true identity
I'll shine so bright

I used to be afraid in the dark,
But now I'm running into the light

Never looking back
I'm on the right track
There's nothing that can change my mind
I'm done with all this games
I'll never be the same
I've got my eyes on the prize

Your love has changed me
So I'll sing it at the top of my lungs
My life has just began

Never looking back
Never looking back

We want a revolution
(We want a revolution)
Love is the solution
(Love is the solution)
We want a revolution
Love is the solution

I've got this hope inside of me
Gotta let it out

Never looking back
I'm on the right track
There's nothing that can change my mind
I'm done with all this games
I'll never be the same
I've got my eyes on the prize

Never looking back
I'm on the right track
There's nothing that can change my mind
I'm done with all this games
I'll never be the same
I've got my eyes on the prize

Your love has changed me
So I'll sing it at the top of my lungs
My life has just began

Never looking back
Never looking back
Never looking back
Never looking back
