Infinity stretches unlimitlessly
Countless days pass by immeasurably
Anniversaries gutter in the maelstrom
Whirling a snowstorm of lustrous millennium

We couldn't stay together
This couldn't last forever

Senses dissolve into soliloquies
Flooding ascent in synchronicity

But we couldn't stay together
I knew this wouldn't last forever

Forever just one more time then never
This is the last string to sever

On and on
It goes on and on

I could stay wherever
I would last forever

Forever just one more time then never
This is the last string to sever

Forever never forever
This is the last string to sever
I have lost you for ever and ever
