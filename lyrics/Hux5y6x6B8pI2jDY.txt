I live inside my own world of make believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
I see the world through eyes covered in pink
Cross out the ones who held my cries and watched me weep

I love everything
Fire spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush!

Tape my eyes open to force reality
Why can't you just let me eat my weight in glee?
I live inside my own world of make believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
Somedays I feel skinnier than all the other kids
And some days I can't tell if my body belongs to me

I love everything
Fire spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush!

I wanna taste your content
Hold your breath and feel the tension
Devils hide behind redemption
Honesty is a one way gate to hell
I wanna taste consumption
Reflex to the waste absurd
Hear the children sing aloud
It's music to the wick burn side wash

Just wanna be care free lately
Just kicking up dirt
Just got one too many quarters in my pocket
Count 'em like four leaf clovers in my locket
Untied laces and just tripping on dirt
Dreams got dirty little alibis playing up
Might as well just run around the nursery and count sheep
