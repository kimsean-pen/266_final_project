I said, "Grandpa what's this picture here?
It's all black and white, and it ain't real clear
Is that you there?" He said "yeah, I was 11"

"Times were tough back in '35
That's me and uncle Joe just tryin' to survive A cotton farm
in a great depression

If it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color"

"Oh, and this one here was taken over seas
In the middle of hell in 1943
In the winter time

You can almost see my breath
That was my tail gunner ol' Johnny Magee
He was a high school teacher from New Orleans

And he had my back
Right through the day we left
If it looks like we were scared to death

Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color"
A picture's worth a thousand words

But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color
"This one is my favorite one

This is me and grandma in the summer sun
All dressed up
The day we said our vows
You can't tell it here but it was hot that June

And that rose was red and her eyes were blue
And just look at that smile
I was so proud
That's the story of my life
Right there in black and white"
And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color
Yeah, A pictures worth a thousand words
But you cant see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color
(Should've seen it in Color)
