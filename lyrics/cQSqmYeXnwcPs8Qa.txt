I can't pretend anymore
That I am not affected, I'm not moved
I can't lie to myself that I'm not always thinkin of you

You make me strong
You show me I'm not weak to fall in love
When I thought I'd never need, now I can't get enough

I always made it on my own
I always thought that I would keep control
You changed everything I believe in
And now I just can't fight this feeling baby

I raise my hands and I surrender
Cuz your love is too strong and I can't go on
Without your tender arms around me
I raise my hands and I surrender
I don't wanna resist cuz your touch and your kiss
Have shattered my defenses
I surrender

I have to admit that I
I never thought I'd need someone this way
Cuz you open my eyes so that I, I could see so much more

I always made it on my own
I always thought that I would keep control
You changed everything I believe in
And now I just can't fight this feeling baby

I raise my hands and I surrender
Cuz your love is too strong and I can't go on
Without your tender arms around me
I raise my hands and I surrender
I don't wanna resist cuz your touch and your kiss
Have shattered my defenses
I surrender

I surrender to this feeling in my heart
I surrender to the safety of your arms
To the touch of your lips, to the taste of your kisses

I raise my hands and I surrender
Cuz your love is too strong and I can't go on
Without your tender arms around me
I raise my hands and I surrender
Cuz your love is too strong and I can't go on
Without you.

I surrender
I raise my hands and I surrender
Cuz your love is too strong and I can't go on
Without your tender arms around me
I surrender
Surrender
Surrender
I can't pretend anymore
I can't lie to myself that I'm not always thinking of you
