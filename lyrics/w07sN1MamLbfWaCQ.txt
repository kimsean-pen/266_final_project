I keep on dancin'
Dancin'
Nothing left to say
Nothing left to do
I find myself alone
And thinking just of you
You got me dancin'
Dancin'

Why don't you help me?
Why don't you guide me?
Why don't you promise
To stand beside me?

There was a man in a foreign land
In love with a woman that he didn't understand
Love is not a thing you command
Love is something that keeps you, keeps you
Dancin'
Dancin'

Why don't you help me?
Why don't you guide me?
Why don't you promise
To stand beside me?

I keep on dancin'
Dancin'
Nothing left to say
Nothing left to do
I find myself alone
And thinking just of you
You've got me dancin'
Dancin'

Why don't you help me?
Why don't you guide me?
Why don't you promise
To stand beside me?

Dancin'
Dancin'
Dancin'
You've got me
Oh
Help me
Guide me
Why don't you promise
To stand beside me
Help me
Oh
