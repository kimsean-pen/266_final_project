Due to my frustration
I waited way too long to say a thing
Sure I accept that I was sad, so I guess now it's not so bad
I lost the memories deep inside my head

Show me that tonight I'm only yours and no one else's
Too blind to see sometimes that you're the one
Now I see you're everything or just maybe my nothing
They say that nothing lasts forever

My bed was meant for two and now I'm missing only you
Or was this spot reserved for no one more

My lonely days are here
I don't think I see you here
I wish that I could sleep until forever

I don't think it's hard, just to tell me that you love me
But you're far away from here and have my heart
So shoot me with the bow that cupid's quiver has one more
The last time I might get to fall in love
