(We're living in a golden age, a golden age, a golden age.)

Stomping along on this big Philip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
Looking across at Richard Rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds

It's difficult you see
To give up baby
To leave a job
When you know
You know the money's from day to day

CHORUS
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
All the joy I see
Thru these architect's eyes

Cold winter bleeds on the girders of Babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and the rocks and the sand

Stomping along on this big Phillip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
These summer scumholes
This goddamned starving life

CHORUS

It's difficult you see
It's difficult you see

CHORUS
