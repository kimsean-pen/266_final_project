Yeah...
Yeah, I been dreamin' of gettin' along
Now I'm awake, dreamin' keep it on keeping on
I catch a break, then a punch to the head

I smile big with a toothless grin, yeah
Supersonic gone and took my soul
I caught the rhythm but the clock was slow yeh
Supersonic, truth be told

I don't need you to live, but I'll never let you go

Yeah...
Yeh I been thinkin', I already know
Nothin' 'bout nothin' or so I have been told, yeh
I'm not the paper, I'm more like the fold

Cut the crease and put the shit in the whole, yeah
Supersonic, gone and took my soul
I caught the rhythm but the clock was slow yet
Supersonic, truth be told

I don't need you to live to ever let you go, yeah
Supersonic, gotta feel it now
I need to hear, need to feel it loud yeh
Supersonic, truth be told

I wanna live my life with the volume full...
Supersonic, gone and took my soul
I stopped the rhythm but my clock was full, yeah
Supersonic, truth be told
I don't need you to live to ever let you go, yeah
Supersonic, gotta feel it now
I need to hear it, need to feel it loud, yeah
Supersonic, truth be told
I wanna live my life with the volume full, yeah...
Yeah yeah yeah...
