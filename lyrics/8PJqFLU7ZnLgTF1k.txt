Boy you never, I'm never lonely
Could be you
So you know I need somebody
Could be you

I could never leave you waiting
Or be untrue
I could never leave you waiting
Or be untrue

Something for ya
If you want to yeah
Cause you're my only one
You don't know it
I've been holding
Cause I want you

Boy you never, I'm never lonely
Could be you
So you know I need somebody
Could be you

I could never leave you waiting
Or be untrue
I could never leave you waiting
Or be untrue
