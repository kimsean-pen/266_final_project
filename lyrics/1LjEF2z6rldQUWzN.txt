Real good listener
So good, I need to whisper
Real good listener
So good, I need to whisper

Real good listener
Talk about a good listener
I'm always with you
Real good listener
So good, I need to whisper
I wouldn't miss you
You sneaky dog and bone

So I'm talking to my mum
And she asks what I'm having for tea
Then I turn my Google on
Up it pops buy some chili con carne
I really don't like it

Real good listener
Talk about a good listener
I'm always with you
Real good listener
So good I need to whisper
I wouldn't miss you
You sneaky dog and bone so

Thanks a bunch for listening to me

I mention to my pal how I bumped into Dan on the street, yeah
When I open up my Facebook
They're saying me and Dan should be friends
I really don't like it

Thanks a bunch for listening to me

Thanks a bunch for listening to me
Thanks a bunch for listening to me
A bunch for listening to me
