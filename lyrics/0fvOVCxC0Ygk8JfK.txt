Hurt a bitch by any means, my circle tighter than skinny jeans
Here you go, here go a diamond ring
I'm good, go invest that in bigger things, cause that's not me
A bitch if I like yo nigga pic
Shorty better hurry up with it and block me
Before I send him a nude to hang up in his room
While I let him hit it like hockey
This that real shit, I turned down three deals bitch
And I'm still lit, I get it bussing like field trips
I pop off, no pill bitch rap hoes wanna steal this
I drop greatness, then I let the people tell
Then it make more noise than jingle bells
I come around they like, "ugh, what's that smell?"
Bitch money, oh you broke, you can't tell
I forgot, for this to be a intro, it's hot
I always got the floor like a mop
I'm tired of being alive, but no I'm not
Type to make your whole career flop
Bitches mad that I stand out
With no features or a handout
I bring a lot to the table, no record label
I'm fucking stable at 19, so don't try it
I just give the streets some excitement
I made 50K in 50 days while you on Instagram teeth whitening
I went from PB&J to eating five pepper steaks
I'm on now, so now they phone work
Before you judge bitch do yo' homework
I'm the man!

We 'bout to get into a fucking classic
You might wanna getcho' popcorn for this one
It's finna get real
