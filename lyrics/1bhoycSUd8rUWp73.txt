I cannot frame, that's why I lose control
I aim, I stumble and I fall
Our adaptation can't be faithful
Your world does not attract me
This is the end you see
There is no more truth in me
As if you would deserve it
You are my enemy

I can't ignore the way you make me bleed
I hate when you throw my thoughts against the wall
Got to wake up and make a stand
The desperation forces another mistake

I count again (I know who to blame)
My life in vain (who said I was sane)
I count again (I know who to blame)
My life in vain (who said I was sane)

Follow your instinct
It usually takes you home
Don't let these words tear you down (down)
You see me hanging by the end of the rope
I tell you

Slow I go
And the wait seems to be over
All that I know
Is that my life has become such a waste for you

I blame and run
Sadly all too often dive into the day without your sympathy
I tend to try but lack the focus, becoming a distant memory
What once was is quickly forgotten
All wrapped up inside
Delete all resemblance
I feel your relief

Slow I go
And the wait seems to be over
All that I know
Is that my life has become such a waste for you

Follow your instinct
It usually takes you home

Slow I go
And the wait seems to be over
All that I know
Is that my life has become such a waste for (you)

Slow I go
And the wait seems to be over
All that I know
Is that my life has become such a waste for you
