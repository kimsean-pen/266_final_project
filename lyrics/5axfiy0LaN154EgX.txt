Well every night I burn
Just like a heretic
And take my turn
Among the lunatics

Follow me, follow me
Follow me down
Follow me, follow me
Follow me down

And the stars are blind
I'm unpredictable
There's no real sign
But I'm incurable

Follow me, follow me
Follow me down
Follow me, follow me
Follow me down

Baby won't you make a believer out of me
I've been in the dark for so long that I can't see
Tell me all your beautiful lies one last time
Dress me in your favorite disguise, I've been blind

Well every night I fade
Into the chaos of this world I made
When I was in between

Follow me, follow me
Follow me down
Follow me, follow me
Follow me down

Baby won't you make a believer out of me
I've been in the dark for so long that I can't see
Tell me all your beautiful lies one last time
Dress me in your favorite disguise, I've been blind

Follow me, follow me
Follow me down
Follow me, follow me
Follow me down

Baby won't you make a believer out of me
I've been in the dark for so long that I can't see
Tell me all your beautiful lies one last time
Dress me in your favorite disguise, I've been blind
I've been blind
I've been blind
I've been blind
I've been blind
I've been blind
