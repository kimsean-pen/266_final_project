Out here looking for the good life
Tongue in my cheek and ya back in my life
I keep pushing through, my eyes right on you
Everyone says you should get away, fast as you can
But I know you'll stay, you never fall behind
It's always on your mind

You're somewhere I wanna go
Nice and swift as we take it slow
Well we're on our way
Don't never hesitate
I'll hide in the dark in the back of your brain
And laugh a little louder as we go insane
No time to waste
I never come too late

If you don't like it
Then try it
If you don't like it
Then try it

Oh, I believe it when I see it
I'll believe it when I see it

You're my misfit and I'm your freak
Dance all night till our knees go weak
We could shut this place down
No one else is around
I try hard to understand
The crush of the world in the palm of your hand
You know we sit just right
Let's run away from the light

If you don't like it
Then try it
If you don't like it
Then try it

Oh babe, I believe it when I see it
I'll believe it when I see it

Tongue in your cheek and back in my knife
Out here looking for the good life
Keep on pushing through
I bet an eye on you
Baby, you know that we're on our way
Misfit and freak every single day
seems to need it all, let's go take it all

If you don't like it
Then try it
If you don't like it
Then try it

I know you can see it, I'll believe it
You can see it, I believe it

We're here for a moment
So let's own it
For a moment, so let's own it

It's here for the taking
Why you waiting?
This good loving is worth making
