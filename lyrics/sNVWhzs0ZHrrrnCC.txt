There never seems to be
Because what I believe
A moment I'm not trying
To show them who I am
Why can't they understand
The things that they're denying
They're denying

So what should I do
Just lay next to you
As though I'm unaffected
And who should I be
When they're judging me
As though I'm unaffected

A chance they'd never give
To ever want to live
The life that I am made of
There's nothing left to prove
My heart's forever true
What is it they're afraid of
Afraid of

So what should I do
Just lay next to you
As though I'm unaffected
And who should I be
When they're judging me
As though I'm unaffected

Before they even saw my face
They knew that I was not the same
And decided I was not the one for you
For you

So what should I do
I'm not unaffected
And who should I be
I'm not unaffected

So what should I do
Just lay next to you
As though I'm unaffected
And who should I be
When they're judging me
As though I'm unaffected

Unaffected
Unaffected
Unaffected
