There'll be a storm one night
Then I'll fly to you for shelter
Soaked in welcome rain
Falling to forbidden arms

Too breathless, too helpless
Too restless to explain needing you

There'll be a storm one night
But you will find my place of hiding
We'll watch the lights like children
Leave the fortress hand in hand

I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning
I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning
And we'll collide, on dry land

There'll be a storm one night
And I will find no other rescue
Lost and far from home
Crying for some guiding light

Too reckless, too helpless
Too hungry to refrain from needing you

There'll be a storm one night
The wind will drive me to your castle
And you'll ignite the fire
As if everything were planned

I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning
I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning
And we'll collide, on dry land

(I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning)
There will be storm one night
(I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning)
There will be storm one night
(I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning)
You will find my place of hiding
Yeah, I will come to you, girl I will come to you

I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning
I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning
And we'll collide, on dry land

No betrayal, no denial
No need to explain
We'll collide
