Wrathful ones, nine eyes gaze
Holding skulls
Filled and laced
With human blood

Wrathful ones, nine eyes gaze
Holding skulls
Filled and laced
With human blood

Shades of darkened sky
Emptiness
Twilight holding through
Offering

Lie in zenith
Bull's bloodshot eye
Flattened portrait
Of night sky

Feel crust hum
Facing the north
Vapor space

Between Heaven and Earth
Wisdom and the knower
A planet collide
Divisible we fall

Hear dirt waves
Wading forth
Vapor space

How long has it been
Since we flew through the shadows?
I have walked on
Many other planets

How long has it been
Since we flew through the shadows?
I have walked on
Many other planets

Sinister twin
Choking on fear
Bonded iron
Sink to the core

Hear dirt waves
Wading forth
Vapor space

Shades of darkened skies
Emptiness
Twilight holding through
Offering

Wrathful ones, nine eyes gaze
Holding skulls
Filled and laced
With human blood
