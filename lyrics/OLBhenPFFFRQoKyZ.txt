I'm always at it every night
Stoking the fire
Yearning for flight
Truth be told I'll soon be old
Top of the middle
I'm in the huddle
I'll drag my body through tiniest tunnels
It turns me on to soon be gone
I'ma I'ma send a
I'm always at it
Chasing the vermin
Sealing the letters and kissing goodbye
Truth be told I'll soon be old
Gathering kibble
Scraps on the table
I'll drag my body through every fable
It turns me on to soon be gone
I'ma
I'ma send a
I'ma send out a message to my love
Sending out a message to my love
Sending out a message when I worry too much
Only thing that matters is not giving up
I'm sending out a message to my love
I'm always at it every night
Dye cast memories strewn aside
Truth be told I'll soon be old
Top of the middle I'm in the huddle
I drag my body through tiniest tunnels
It turns me on to soon be gone
