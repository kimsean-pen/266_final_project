I see the darkness in your eyes
I feel the spark of life go weaker in your restless soul
I can hear your fading cries
A relentless wail now going on
And on

When the tears are in your eyes
You sing a drunken lullaby
And the weight of the world
Comes crashing on your spine
Now remember what's inside
The warmth that made you smile
And rise up high
Towards the golden sky

Your eden
Your eden

Blood is gushing from your palms
Your feeble heart is breaking, your soul reduced to ash
Pictures racing through your mind
Dearest memories from not so long ago

When the tears are in your eyes
You sing a drunken lullaby
And the weight of the world
Comes crashing on your spine
Now remember what's inside
The warmth that made you smile
And rise up high
Towards the golden sky

Your eden
Your eden

Your eden
Your eden
Your eden
Your eden
Your eden
Your eden
Your eden
Your eden

When the tears are in your eyes
You sing a drunken lullaby
And the weight of the world
Comes crashing on your spine
Now remember what's inside
The warmth that made you smile
And rise up high
Towards the golden sky

Your eden
