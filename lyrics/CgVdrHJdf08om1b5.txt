You say you don't love me
Well that's alright with me 'cos I'm in love with you
And I wouldn't want you doin' things, you don't want to do
Oh you know, I've always wanted you to be in love with me
And it took so long to realize, the way things have to be

I wanted to live in a dream that couldn't be real
And I think I understand now the way that you feel
You say, you don't
You say, you don't

You say you don't love me
Well that's alright with me 'cos I have got the time
To wait in case someday, you maybe change your mind
I've decided not to make the same mistakes this time around
As I'm tired of having heartaches, I've been thinking and I've found

I don't want to live in a dream, I want somethin' real
And I think I understand now the way that you feel
You say you don't
You say you don't
You say you don't

You say, you don't
You say, you don't

You say you don't love me
Well that's alright with me, I'm not in love with you
I just want us to do the things, we both want to do
Though I've got this special feelin', I'd be wrong to call it love
For the word entails a few things that I would be well rid of

I've no need to live in a dream, it's finally real
And I think I understand now the way that you feel
You say, you don't
You say, you don't

You say, you don't love me
You say, you don't love me
You say, you don't love me
Hmm
