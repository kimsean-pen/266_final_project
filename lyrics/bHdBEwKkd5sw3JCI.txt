Don't worry this face,
Hold my hand in error,
Don't tell of this place, it's for me and you only,
Softly softly know me,
Don't worry this face,
Hold my hand in error,
Don't tell of this place, it's for me and you only
You give me love, you know give me love (with your ultraviolet rays)
You give me love, you know you give me love (ultraviolet) x4
