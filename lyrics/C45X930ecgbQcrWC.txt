First, first, first
You're my first, first
First, first, first
You're my first, first

頭じゃ理解出来ない
ココロがハジケル感覚
始めて教えてくれたのは
キミなのgimme nowキミのlove

(I need you boy) Wake up, wake up, listen to me
(Wa-want you boy) Come on, come on, singing with me
(You got me, boy) Follow, follow, following me
(You-you're my first) 止められない気持ち

You gave me my first love
You let me know first love
My only first boy
Baby, let's go

I gotta love now
相当excitedしてるキミとのA to Z待ちきれナイ
I'm gonna love now
だからこそgive you allアタシのfirstもささげる

I gotta love now
You're ma-ma-ma-ma-my first
Ma-ma-ma-ma-my first
You're ma-ma-ma-ma-my first
You're my first, first
You're ma-ma-ma-ma-my first
Ma-ma-ma-ma-my first
You're ma-ma-ma-ma-my first
You're my first, first

一言で気持ちが揺れる
キミのmotionでup, up, up
しても down, down, down, down, down, down
激しい up and down, down, down, down, down, down

んなにgirlsに囲まれても
アタシだけを求めるキミ
戸惑いが歓びにchanging
キミなのgimme nowキミのlove

(I need you boy) Wake up, wake up, listen to me
(Wa-want you boy) Come on, come on, singing with me
(You got me, boy) Follow, follow, following me
(You-you're my first) 止められない気持ち

You gave me my first love
You let me know first love
My only first boy
