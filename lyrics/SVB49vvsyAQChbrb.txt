Keeps away from me
(Keeps away from me)
Keeps away from you

I move all right
I got the wheels going round
Making ways in the night
Yeah, we're movin' all right
Wipin' the rain from the ground
And the pale from the sky

But something happens in his heart
When the morning comes

The secrets that she keeps away from me
(Keeps away from me)
The tears on the pillow, she don't want me to see
(Keeps away from me)
Well, every little thing she does is for me
(Keeps away from you)
But somebody new is breaking us in two

He's the kind of love
That makes a whirl in your mind
Like the tide and the time
With just a little bit o'soul
He fights to find peace of mind
In these shattering eyes

But something happens in his heart
When the morning comes

The secrets that she keeps away from me
(Keeps away from me)
The tears on the pillow, she don't want me to see
(Keeps away from me)
Well, every little thing she does is for me
(Keeps away from you)
But somebody new is breaking us in two

The secrets that she keeps away from me
(Keeps away from me)
The tears on the pillow, she don't want me to see
(Keeps away from me)
Well, every little thing she does is for me
(Keeps away from you)
But somebody new is breaking us in two

The secrets that she keeps away from me
(Keeps away from me)
The tears on the pillow, she don't want me to see
(Keeps away from me)
Well, every little thing she does is for me
(Keeps away from you)
But somebody new is breaking us in two

The secrets that she keeps away, away from me
(Keeps away from me)
The love of you and me
(Keeps away from me)

The secrets that she keeps away, away from me
(Keeps away from me)
The love of you and me
(Keeps away from me)

The secrets that she keeps away from me
(Keeps away from me)
The love of you and me
(Keeps away from me)
The secrets that she keeps away, away from me
(Keeps away from me)
The love of you and me
(Keeps away from me)
The secrets that she keeps away, away from me
(Keeps away from me)
The love of you and me
(Keeps away from me)
The secrets that she keeps away, away from me
(Keeps away from me)
