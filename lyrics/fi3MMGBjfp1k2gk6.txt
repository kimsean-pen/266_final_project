We met on New Years Eve in New York City
How cold it had been then and soon will be again
We could've lived together and given up our dreams of wandering
We could've left together
and given up our dreams of the home we could keep
You may travel alone and still be accompanied by my love

We parted by my birthday and without you here I am a different age
How bright I had been then and fear it may not ever show again
So continue to live alone and speak not your thoughts of land or holiday
& I will leave again and make all new plans to fill the space that you left
I do travel alone and yours is not a number I can call on the phone
