It's getting hard for me to reframe all those shifting memories
Like a music box that never starts dancing by itself
What a broken world, what a broken world
It is my only wish to see you, to see through you
I step inside

Letting go
I want to be happier now
I want to be more than closed
Surreal, the way you made me out
The way you crashed me down

It's getting hard for me to remember all of the names from my life
You've been so many
Different kinds of people in my mind

Letting go
I want to be happier now
I want to be more than closed
Surreal, the way you made me out
Letting go
I want to be happier now
I want to be more than closed
Surreal, the way you made me out
The way you crashed me down

Letting go
I want to be happier now
I want to be more than closed
Surreal, the way you made me out
Letting go
I want to be happier now
I want to be more than closed
Surreal, the way you made me out
The way you crashed me down
