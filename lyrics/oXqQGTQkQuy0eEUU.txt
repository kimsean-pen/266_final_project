Take you for a ride
Take you for a ride
Down there
Waited in line, all this time

And you can step inside
and I can step inside
and there's nowhere you can hide
there's nowhere I can hide

You said we'd make a deal
You said we'd make a deal
Down there
It's what you said, It's what you said

Did you tell me all your lies
Such a thin disguise
We fool ourselves
fool ourselves

Anything you wanted wasn't what you needed
When I called you on the street
you said you started to believe that it was always so
ain't it always so, ain't it always so

Everything you wanted wasn't what you needed
When I called you on the street
you said you started to believe that it was always so
ain't it always so, ain't it always so

Anything you wanted wasn't what you needed
When I called you on the street
you said you started to believe that it was always so
ain't it always so, ain't it always so

Everything you wanted wasn't what you needed
When I called you on the street
you said you started to believe that it was always so
ain't it always so, ain't it always so
