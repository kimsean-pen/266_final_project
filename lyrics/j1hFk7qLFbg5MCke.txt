Wasted days I'm not a cliche
But I love dancing in the rain
Run away I made a mistake
Now I must pave the way

There's a universe I'd rather be now
But there's no point complaining
Wasted space all in your head
Cowering under

Watching you go away
The sun, it kills me everyday
Don't know how you've led me astray
But now you're such a bore
Sundays never been a chore
I'm seeing it clearer than before

But where do I go to now
It's all mellow and shallow anyhow
Hard to be myself in such a race
Scornful faces unkind places

Summertime is always breezy in here
But don't get too relieved
Walk in places you've never been
You're not getting younger

Watching you go away
The sun it kills me everyday
Don't know how you've led me astray
But now you're such a bore
Sundays never been a chore
im seeing it clearer than before

But where do I go to now
It's all mellow and shallow anyhow
Hard to be myself in such a race
Scornful faces unkind places

Take a chance tonight
Better now before you lose sight
I don't think I sound crazy
Clock is ticking, you're not watching
