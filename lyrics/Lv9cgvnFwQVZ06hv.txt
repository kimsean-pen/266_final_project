All is quiet on New Year's Day
A world in white gets underway
I want to be with you, be with you, night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's Day, on New Year's Day

I will be with you again
I will be with you again

Under a blood red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few
The newspapers says, says, say it's true, it's true

And we can break through
Though torn in two, we can be one

I will be with you again
