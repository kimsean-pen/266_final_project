Driving off
Trying to meet you
Feel it out
Will I need to

Let's expect no more than all elastic day
Hold your feelings back for all elastic, all elastic day

Trimming off
Trying to meet you

Pound it all aside for all elastic days
Feel the need I tried for all elastic, all elastic day
Elastic day
Elastic day
Elastic day

Tired out
To think I'll meet you
Had a doubt
That I'll leave you

And the sky is back to all elastic day
Then the wheels came off, I don't know what to say
It all made some sense if you know what to play
But I lost the plot of all elastic, all elastic day
Elastic day
