I can't believe anything that you're saying to me
I just can't see how you ever dreamed this was for the best
I can't believe in these things that you pretend to see
I just don't see how the fuck you could ever think that I'd agree

Leave me on the outskirts of this
Seven-headed whore of a one-horse town

Nothing to see here, move along
Nobody to hear your black swan song
Someone please do something, something's wrong
He's no longer breathing, but singing along

I can't believe anything that you're saying to me
I just can't see how you ever dreamed this was for the best
I can't believe in these things that you pretend to see
I just don't see how the fuck you could ever think that I'd agree

Leave me on the outskirts of this
Seven-headed whore of a one-horse town

Nothing to see here, move along
Nobody to hear your black swan song
Someone please do something, something's wrong
He's no longer breathing, but singing along

Nothing to see here, move along
Nobody to hear your black swan song
Someone please do something, something's wrong
He's no longer breathing, but singing along

Someone to hold onto
Some place like space I've never been
Nothing left to get through
A name and a face I'll never see again

Someone to hold onto
Someone to hold onto

Nothing to see here, move along
Nobody to hear your black swan song
Someone please do something, something's wrong
He's no longer breathing, but singing along

Nothing to see here, move along
Nobody to hear your black swan song
Someone please do something, something's wrong
He's no longer breathing, but singing along

Nothing to see here, move along
Nobody to hear your black swan song
Someone please do something, something's wrong
He's no longer breathing, but singing along
