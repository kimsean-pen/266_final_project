Hey, I'm feeling ok, its good
cause lately I been feeling so strange
like I been re-arranged, changed
and these voices
the ones that I can hear in my head
oh these fellas are telling me that I'd be better off dead
their painting me red
oh!
hey...

and lately
its been getting harder to sleep
these muscle spasms hit me so deep
and every single night I get cold
like I can't feel my hands or my toes
and no one told me which way to go
I know but I'm still here so

why don't you
pour me another one kyle

hey

why can't I come down
ho!

hey
oh

ooh yeah!
I'm so cold again
can't feel my face again,
no
my patience is wearing thin
6 a.m. there goes the moon
I feel like death is coming soon and
oh...
all I wanna do is fuckin sleep

mm, yeah...

nothing flashed before my eyes, yeah
no pretty angels, and no bright lights
all I saw was the devil's soul
and it looked a hell of a lot like my own...
ho!
