I've been thinking lately
You've been acting crazy
You've been acting shady you know
I don't need you to save me
Love is getting hazy
All I gotta say is

We ain't shit
But you call my phone
When you're all alone
When you're on your own
It's time, you go
I told you so, no we ain't shit
You stay in my face
Get me out this place I need my space
No time to chase
Now I got that taste

There's no way to fade
Talking 'bout some bullshit
Save that shit for later
Trynna to meet my family
She don't understand me
Acting like my girlfriend

Fuck her by my phone
Girl you got me blown
Always asking me for favors

Tell me pick up and I won't
Thinking I care but I don't, yeah
Taking me out of my zone
You know I stay on my own, yeah
