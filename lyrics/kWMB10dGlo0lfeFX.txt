Put your lighter in the air and lead me back home
When it's all said and done
I'll follow the echoes
I hear you night after night calling out my name
And I find myself running to meet you

I didn't want to escape from the bricks that I lay down
You are the only one
The only one that see me
Trusts me and believes me
You are the only one
The only one that knows me
And in the dark you show me
Yeah it's perfectly reckless
Damn, you leave me defenseless
So break in, break in

You let me fall apart without letting go
Then you pick up the pieces and you make me whole

I didn't wanna escape from the bricks that I lay down
You are the only one
The only that sees me
Trusts me and believes me
You are the only one
The only one that knows me
And in the dark you show me
Yeah its perfectly reckless
Damn, you leave me defenseless
So break in

And take everything I have
Til there is nothing left
Until it's just your voice in my head
And when the lights come on
You see me as I am
You're still inside me

You are the only one
The only one that sees me
Trusts me and believes me
You are the only one
The only one who knows me
And in the dark you show me
Yeah it's perfectly reckless
Damn, you leave me defenseless
So break in

Break in

Put your lighter in the air and lead me back home
