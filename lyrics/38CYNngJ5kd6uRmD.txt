The first good joy that Mary had
It was the joy of one.
The first rejoice that Mary had
Was to see her new born son.

To see her new born son good man,
And blessed may he be.
Sing Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
To all eternity.
The next good joy that Mary had
It was the joy of two.
To see her son Jesus,
Make the lame to go.

The next rejoice that Mary had,
It was the joy of three.
To see her own son Jesus,
To make the blind to see.

To make the blind to see good man,
And blessed may he be.
Sing Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
To all eternity.

The next good joy our lady had,
It was the joy of four.
It was the rejoice of her dear son,
When he read the bible o'er.

The next good joy that Mary had,
It was the joy of five.
To see her own son Jesus,
To make the dead alive.

To make the dead alive good man,
And blessed may he be.
Sing Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
To all eternity.

The next rejoice our lady had,
It was the rejoice of six.
To see her own son Jesus,
To bear the crucifix.

The next good joy that Mary had,
It was the joy of seven.
To see her own son Jesus,
To wear the crown of heaven.

To wear the crown of heaven good man,
And blessed may he be.
Sing Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
To all eternity.

And glory may he be,
And blessed now be she.
And those who sing the seven long verses,
In honour of our lady.
