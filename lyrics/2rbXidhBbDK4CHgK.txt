I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm beggin you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
But I still, don't understand
Just how your love can do what no on else can

Got me lookin so crazy right now, your love
Got me lookin so crazy right now
Got me lookin so crazy right now, your touch
Got me lookin so crazy right now
Got me hoping you page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you save me right now
Lookin so crazy, your love's got me lookin
Lookin so crazy in love

When you talk to my friends so quietly
"Who he think he is?" Look at what you've done to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
You ain't here, ain't no one else to impress
It's just the way that you knew what I thought I knew
It's just the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me lookin so crazy right now, your love
Got me lookin so crazy right now
Got me lookin so crazy right now, your touch

Got me lookin so crazy right now
Got me hoping you page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you save me right now
Lookin so crazy, your love's got me lookin
Lookin so crazy in love

Got me lookin so crazy right now, your love
Got me lookin so crazy right now
Got me lookin oh crazy right now, your touch
Got me lookin oh crazy right now
Got me hoping you save me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you page me right now
Lookin so crazy, you've got me lookin
Lookin so crazy in love

Ohoh
Crazy right now
Crazy right now

Lookin

Lookin so crazy

Got me hoping you page me right now
Lookin so crazy, your love's got me lookin
Lookin so crazy in love
