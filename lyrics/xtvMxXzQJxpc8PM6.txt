Up and down like a red rubber ball
You're always back and forth
Like the clock on the wall
I wanna know about you
I'm spinning all around you

If I stay
Do you think that we could change your routine?
I know a trick
I've always got a few up my sleeve
This life is controlled confusion
It's just the grand illusion

And you asked me
"How do you feel when you're away?"
And you asked me
"How do you pass the days?"

Sing along to a song that I know
It goes bah bah bada
I sing it over and over
Let it hypnotize you
I'll still be right beside you

Hold my hand
You can follow my lead
You're like a ballerina
twirling 'round on your feet
And watching is so fantastic
I wanna ask you

"Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again"

"Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again"

Now collapse
Take delight in the fall
And catch your breath
I know you feel the ring from it all
So try to collect yourself now
It's just a euphoric comedown

And you asked me
"How do you feel when you're away?"
And you asked me
"How do you pass the days?"

Because I can still remember when you were afraid of the dark
And I told you to come
And you followed where I asked you to go
You to go
"Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again"
"Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again"
