Today, I climb the highest mountain I have ever climbed
And I turn, to look at ruins I had left behind
And you, where were you so far removed from any truth
I lost you
Didn't I?
First I think I lost myself

Children
Then and forever locked in a memory
Olden
That mirror searching for some kind of certainty
That you were just the same as everyone
But you were wrong
And it hurt you
Didn't it?
All you couldn't be

Ruins
Ohhh
Ruins
Ohhh

I tried to hold on to some kind of dignity
Too long I waded through a vast and endless sea
Thinking, I could find the secret there within
But I gave up
Did not seem the only way

Ruins
All the things we built assured that they would last
Ending months ticket stubs, and written notes and photographs
Where are you and here somewhere I cannot go
I'm sorry
I am
But I don't take it back
And in the night I hear your voice
Sometimes but it quickly passes
In dreams I saw what I had thought
Could be some kind of answer
You try and try and try until you cannot try no more
Captured in our own

Ruins
Ohhh
Ruins
Ohhh
Ruins
