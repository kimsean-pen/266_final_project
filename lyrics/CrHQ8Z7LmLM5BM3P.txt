Strangulation to the death
All life under his grasp
Mass forsaken, forever scorned
Yearning to be reborn

No way out
Genocide
Inhuman
Bloodicide

Masked assailant
The dreaded crawl
Crying to die
Screaming to be unborn

Human bloodicide

Dark cathedral claiming souls
Shredded cries of anguish choke
Suffering in blood we're drowned
Stripped and bled the broken bound

Mutilation
Horrified
Inhuman
Bloodicide

His salvation is their death
Willing to die, undead the flesh
Mass sedation
Screaming gone
Begging for life
Bleeding to be reborn

No way out
Bloodicide

Afraid in brazen grief
Dawn eternal, silence screams
Death awakes, the dead can dream
Hell the final resting place to be

Dark cathedral claiming souls
Shredded cries of anguish choke
Suffering in blood we're drowned
Stripped and bled the broken bound

Dark cathedral claiming souls
Shredded cries of anguish choke
Suffering in blood we're drowned
Stripped and bled the broken bound
