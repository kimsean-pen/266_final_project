It's such a funny sensation to be
So happy that you wanna die
Promises always were crazy to me
But never was I so surprised
Minutes are longer when we are apart
Your presence more than I can handle
It's come to the point were I wonder if I
could ever be luckier when

Suddenly I
Back at the core
Thinking of her
Who had you before?
Where you as good
As good as we are?
Do you remember?

Did you love her

The way you love me?
Is there a chance that there might be
Traces of her
That you carry
Under the surface?
Lend me you ears

I would like to confess
I'm doubting that you can be real

By your side wearing a beautiful dress
I celebrate how good it feels
Say that you love me, say that it's true
I know that I want to believe you
But somehow silence speaks louder than words

I'm worried she's still on your mind
Suddenly I
Back at the core

Thinking of her
Who had you before?
Where you as good
As good as we are?

Do you remember?
Did you love her
The way you love me?
Is there a chance that there might be
Traces of her
That you carry
Under the surface?
I know that I'm selfish
I know that it's bad
I know but it's driving me mad
It's driving me mad
Suddenly I
Back at the core
Thinking of her
Who had you before?
Were you as good
As good as we are?
Do you remember?
Did you love her
The way you love me?
Is there a chance that there might be
Traces of her
That you carry
Under the surface?
Under the surface
Under the surface
