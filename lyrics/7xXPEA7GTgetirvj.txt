I can't sleep tonight
Wide awake and so confused
Eveything's in line
But I am bruised

I need a voice to echo
I need a light to take me home
I kinda need a hero
Is it you?

I never see the forest for the trees
I could really use your melody
Baby, I'm a little blind
I think it's time for you to find me

Can you be my nightingale?
Sing to me, I know you're there
You could be my sanity
Bring me peace
Sing me to sleep
Say you'll be my nightingale

Somebody speak to me
'Cause I'm feeling like hell
Need you to answer me
I'm overwhelmed

I need a voice to echo
I need a light to take me home
I need a star to follow, I don't know

I never see the forest for the trees
I could really use your melody
Baby, I'm a little blind
I think it's time for you to find me

Can you be my nightingale?
Sing to me, I know you're there
You could be my sanity
Bring me peace
Sing me to sleep
Say you'll be my nightingale

I dont know what I'd do without you
Your words are like a whisper, come through
As long as you're with me here tonight, I'm good

Can you be my nightingale?
Feel so close, I know you're there

Oh, oh, oh nightingale
Sing to me, I know you're there
'Cause, baby, you're my sanity
You bring me peace
Sing me to sleep
Say you'll be my nightingale

Oh
(Uh, uh)
