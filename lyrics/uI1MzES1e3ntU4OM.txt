Come on

Maybe I just wanna touch you
Feel you warm inside again
Maybe I just wanna hurt you
The sweetest pleasure is pain

I don't know why, why
But I love to see you cry
I don't know why, why
It just makes me feel alive

Are you coming to the moment
When you know your heart can break
I'm inside you, I'm around you
I just want to hear you cry again

I don't know why, why
But I love to see you cry
I don't know why, why
It just makes me feel alive

I don't know why, why
But I love to see you cry
I don't know why, why
But it makes me feel alive

You don't know how much it hurts
When you fall asleep in my arms
And if this dies before the morning comes
I want to runaway, I want to runaway

I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why

I don't know why, why
But I love to see you cry
I don't know why, why
It just makes me feel alive
I don't know why, why
But I love to see you cry
I don't know why, why
But it makes me feel alive
I love to see you cry
