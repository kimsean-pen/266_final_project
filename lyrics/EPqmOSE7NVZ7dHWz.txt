I should be losing sleep but losing ain't enough
There's not a tragedy so bad it keeps me up
I should be crying out but crying is a shame
Is it even easier when nothing ever changes?

Life!
These are the times
That will define
Us, you and I
Will you look back on this one day?
Will you look back on this and say
"I'm crossing the lines
That are dividing
Us, you and I
When you look back on this one day
Will you look back on this one day?

I'm in the aftermath but asking what and why
Because I'm making sense is never adding up
No stop, no grinding, huh, in finding "are we dead?"
What's this gonna do with me? They say we're looking up

Life!
These are the times
That will define
Just you and I
Will you look back on this one day?
Will you look back on this and say
"I'm
Crossing the lines
That are dividing
Us, you and I
When you look back on this one day
Will you look back on this one day?

Times
Are coming alive
We can fight this, you and I
Will you look back on this one day
And find the aftermath has changed?

I'm
Drawing the lines
That will define us
Us, you and I
Will you look back on this one day?
Will you look back on this and say
"I'm crossing the lines
That are dividing
Us, you and I
When you look back on this one day
Will you look back on this one day?
