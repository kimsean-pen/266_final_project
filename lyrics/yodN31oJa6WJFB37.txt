Maybe somewhere else
Will not be half as cold as me
The curtains drawn the winter sun
Makes patterns on your face
It looks like some kaleidoscopic breathing exercise

It's the same
It's the same
It's the same
Baby wont you breathe
Baby wont you breathe

Hold me in your freezin' arms
Before we have to go.
I wince a little, but it's not because I know the truth
The windshield of your little car is frosted through the glass
A clear heart of air appears as we shiver on the seats

It's the same(It's the same, the same)
It's the same
It's the same

It's the same(It's the same, the same)
It's the same
It's the same

Treat it as a test
Treat it as a test
Baby wont you breathe
Baby wont you breathe
It's the same
It's the same
It's the same

It's the same (It's the same, the same)
It's the same
It's the same
