Out in the morning come
You don't need to ask an alibi
And in the morning comes
You don't need to be so honest

And in the morning come
You don't need to ask an alibi
And in the morning comes
You don't need to breathe so easy

I laughed so hard I fell down
I cursed these lanes I walked on

No one does it like you
No one does it like you
I tried so hard
But no one does it like you
No one does it like you
But I tried so hard

I tried so hard
I tried so hard
