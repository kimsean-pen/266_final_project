Forevermore, an eternal wave enfolds, ekpyrosis occur
Transits in fiery red, invoked flat fourth dimension
Extending to all sides, the equation of state

As branes, in true magnitude we collide in cosmos and light
Expanse, in matter and time, void dimension, eternal night

Into the absolute, as we blend into cosmic mist, conflagration behold
Reborn in shattered past, in the midst of erasing stars
At the world's dawn, the eternal cosmic night

Forevermore, an eternal wave enfolds
Bleach into the absolute, spirit divine
In time and space aligned
In time and space, eternal night
