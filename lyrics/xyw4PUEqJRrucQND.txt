If your circle stays unbroken then you're a lucky man
'Cause it never, never, never has for me
In the palace of the virgin lies the chalice of the soul
And it's likely you might find the answer there

She had thirteen years of teenage tears
Never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before
She saw the sight of land
She was a photograph just ripped in half
A smile inside a frown
And then the light, the answer right
Inside her coming down

He said
I can go away
I can leave here
I can be invisible
I go away

He was just eighteen and in between
A lady and a man
His daddy's girl in momma's world
That was when he ran
You know the word confused has been abused
But that's just what he was
And then the spark inside the dark
The answer came because

He said
You can go away
You can leave here
You can be invisible

Well I grew up quick and I felt the kick
Of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and the I took a fast look
At just the very last page
It was a single word that I'd just heard
From the two that came before
The only way to really stay
Is to walk right out the door

So I'll go away
I'm going to leave here
I can be invisible
Go away again

I can go away
When I leave here
I can be invisible

I said
When I go away
Lord you know it's right to leave here
So I just become invisible

I'm going away
Disappear before your eyes

You'll never touch me
You'll feel touch me
You'll never see me again
Because I've just become unseen

When I'm a photograph that's torn in half
We're only eighteen and in between
We need a helping hand to the holy land
To be invisible
To go away
