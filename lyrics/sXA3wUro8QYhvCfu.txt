Why is it so hard
To make it in America 2x
I try so hard
To make it in America
A land with milk and honey,
A land supposed to be built with love
It take love and understanding
To live and let live
I was born in Gainesville florida
I traveled for and wide
then i moved to brooklyn, New York
Had hard times...

So I say to myself
looks like nothing gonna change
I got to move away from here
I wanna save New York
a little town they call Poughkeepsie
got me a job
to get away from all this stress
but I can't away
no matter how far I went
looks like nothing gonna change
