Follow down if I wanna go
Follow down if I wanna

Pull out the show tonight
If I'm gonna work it the right way home
Take out your thoughts for now
Let me see the skin that I want to know

If I'm the right girl, if I'm gonna be the one for you
If I'm the right girl, oh I'm taking off
Follow down if I wanna

Free
That is what I'm asking for
Pulse
Running up you have my word
If you got a fur, if you got a fur
If you got a fur, if you got a fur

What are we working for?
Likes of us can be what we want somehow
Try find the change you know
If we look we know that it might work out

If I'm the right girl, if I'm gonna be the one for you
If I'm the right girl, oh I'm taking off
Follow down if I wanna

Free
That is what I'm asking for
Pulse
Running up you have my word
If you got a fur, if you got a fur
If you got a fur, if you got a fur

I gotta be
The one to take you down

Free
That is what I'm asking for
Pulse
Running up you have my word
If you got a fur, if you got a fur
If you got a fur, if you got a fur
