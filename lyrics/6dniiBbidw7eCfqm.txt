From the lake
Where I lost it all
Stacked on the stake
Yet you blessed the fall

I guess that I knew I was warned
I left my words in the cold
The things that I built for myself
Castles are tumbling down
Surrender the heir, savour the crown
Here lies where I drown

The first time that I sought for grace
But not the last lung I'd put to waste

I'm burning down the stakes
Wash away, wash away

I'm burning down the stakes
Wash away, wash away

Tumbling through this jaded book
The hearts I stole, the air I took
What love is this
And now the photograph is all that's left
To feed the wolves and empty chests
To break the best

The first time that I sought for grace
But not the last lung I'd put to waste

I'm burning down the stakes
Wash away, wash away

I'm burning down the stakes
Wash away, wash away

I'm burning down the stakes
Wash away, wash away

I'm burning down the stakes
Wash away, wash away

I never bled for a thousand lies
Just to stem the flow
I never wept over a thousand lives
Just to let this go

I never bled for a thousand lies
Just to stem the flow
I never wept over a thousand lives
Just to let this go

Wash away, wash away, wash away, wash away
