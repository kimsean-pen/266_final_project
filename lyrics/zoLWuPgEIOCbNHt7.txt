Walking the line
I'm walking the line
treading thin ice
time after time

I go for the best, end up with much less
I need the real thing
forget all the rest
oh yeah, alright

Started out good
working out bad
all the sweet love turned
sour and sad

A face and name
it's always the same
so tired of playing love's foolish games
tell me why
love passes me by

Cold love, cold love
another shot of rock'n'roll love
cold love, cold love
whatever happened to that
good old love
tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
tell me why, tell me why

Hope in the dark, love in the light
I'll keep on looking for someone
who's right

I'm out for the best
can you stand the test
I need the real thing
no more and no less
tell me why
love passes me by

Cold love, cold love
another shot of rock'n'roll love
cold love, cold love
whatever happened to that
sweet old love
tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
tell me why, tell me why

Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
tell me why, tell me why

Cold love, cold love
whatever happened to that
sweet old love
Cold love, cold love
another shot of rock'n'roll love
cold love, cold love
whatever happened to that
sweet old love
cold love, cold love
whatever happened to that
sweet old love
