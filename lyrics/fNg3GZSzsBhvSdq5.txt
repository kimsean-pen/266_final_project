I feel a storm is rising
The sound of the beast unleashing
This isn't how I want the story to play out
There's something beneath the water, that's moving
The clarity in my reflection, I'm losing
A serpent beneath the surface
A force that has been unharnessed
I cannot keep it bottled up anymore

I've become lost in the sea
Where saints become sinners
And hate needs to breathe
I've never felt this before
The darkest of feelings so far from the shore

I've been the viper since day one
Spitting venom with a forked tongue
The time has come, to shed the shadows
I, the demon unleashed

There's something beneath the water, that's moving
The clarity in my reflection, I'm losing
I see the serpent rising, I feel the rage is gathering
I'm losing the battle between wrong and right

I've become lost in the sea
Where saints become sinners
And hate needs to breathe
I've never felt this before
The darkest of feelings so far from the shore

I've been the viper since day one
Spitting venom with a forked tongue
The time has come, to shed the shadows
I, the demon unleashed

The time has come, to shed the shadows
I, the demon unleashed
