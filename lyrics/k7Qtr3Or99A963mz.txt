Goodnight, daylight
I won't remember you for long
Sleep tight, fist fight
Until December's come and gone

It's only late you have time
With any reason that you find

Somewhere in slumber
Is someone who did't see it coming

If all this leaves you behind
And everything starts to rewind

It doesn't mean anything
You won't remember what you see
It could take you a lifetime
A lifetime

You got lost
Lost through the night
It's no loss
You'll be alright

Tell me you'll feel better
When you're sleeping though the day
And I'll tell you how you missed it
When you wake

It doesn't mean anything
what you done or where you've been
It was a chance of a lifetime

You got lost
Lost through the night
It's no loss
You'll be alright

Tell me you'll feel better
When you are sleeping though the day
And I'll tell you how you missed it
When you wake up

(When you wake up)
(When you wake up)
(When you wake up)
