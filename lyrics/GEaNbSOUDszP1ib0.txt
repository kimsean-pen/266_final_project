Goodnight Europe, no one really got you
I suppose it's hardly a protest
But I'm sad to see you go
Europe, I'm sorry
They boarded all your windows and your doors
Now it smells like death is coming up through the floors

It's hard to feel like you're alive
Maybe we might as well be blind
It's hard to tell right from wrong
I guess we kinda knew it all along

Europe, it's not you
I'm starting to think it could be me
My left ideals and university degree
Europe, I'm lonely
Everyone got bored and moved along
Now I'm left here, wondering if I still belong

It's hard to feel like you're alive
Maybe we might as well be blind
It's hard to tell right from wrong
I guess we kinda knew it all along

It's hard to feel like you're alive
Maybe we might as well be blind
It's hard to tell right from wrong
I guess we kinda knew it all along

And the coal is getting to your bones
All alone in the eurozone
