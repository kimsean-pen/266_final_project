There's not a day that passes by, the pain has not amassed inside
It's breaking me down to the ground, it's like I crashed and died
It's hard to leave your past behind especially when you're last in line
And half the time it acts like vines and wraps inside my fragile mind
Hiding in plain view, it seems the same old shit I choose between
Taking who I used to be and keeping it subdued beneath
Close to dead and losing me, you took a chance and you believed
So did I, I let you lead and grabbed the line you threw to me
And through it all

You saved me, you made me
And through it all, you changed me forever
You love me, you hate me
And through it all, you changed me forever

You've given me a chance to change, helped me in ways I can't explain
I'll never understand the way you took my hand with no dismay
Now I'm who I am today, and that's the man I plan to stay
But can't escape, I can't evade, you stranded me and ran away
Why'd you do it? Why'd you leave? Why'd you help me find my feet?
Why'd you guide me blindingly then turn and say goodbye to me?
All this time I tried to be the person you applied to me
This lie you feed that I'd succeed is why I'm me, a dying breed

You saved me, you made me
And through it all, you changed me forever
You love me, you hate me
And through it all, you changed me forever

Through it all, you changed me, I'm not the same me
For better or for worse, this person that you made me
Through it all, you changed me, I'm not the same me
For better or for worse, you changed me forever

It's killing me down deep within, it makes me strain to breathe again
All this pain I keep it in; if it's the end, where'd we begin?
It's so hard to comprehend where we are is where we end
Let's make believe, let's just pretend you don't hate me and want me dead
What you said stays in my head, an unrelenting discontent
It torments me to no extent, entrenches me just like cement
It makes no sense what's your intent, bled for me then fled instead
You never meant to be content, fuck the words, let's just be friends

You saved me, you made me
And through it all, you changed me forever
You love me, you hate me
And through it all, you changed me forever

Through it all, you changed me, I'm not the same me
For better or for worse, this person that you made me
Through it all, you changed me, I'm not the same me
For better or for worse, you changed me forever
Through it all, you changed me, I'm not the same me
For better or for worse, this person that you made me
Through it all, you changed me, I'm not the same me
For better or for worse, you changed me forever
