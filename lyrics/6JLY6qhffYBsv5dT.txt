I am the face of piss and shit and sugar
I do a crooked little dance with my funny little monkey
What I want, what I want is just your children
I hate what I have become to escape what I hated being

Calliopenis envy from your daddy
You're not gonna hear what he don't want to hear
What I say, disgusts him

He wants to be me and that scares him
Let's do a funny little dance with my funny little monkey
The black keys

Here is my real head
Here is my real head
I wear this fuckin' mask because you cannot handle me
Here is my real head

They try to blink me not to think me
Don't want to bring me out
I am the rotten teeth, my fists are lined with suckers
My prison skins an eyesore-mirror-sketch-pad

I am your son
Your dad
You fag
I am your fad

Here is my real head
Here is my real head
Well I wear this fuckin' mask because you cannot handle me
Here is my real head

Here is my real head
Here is my real head
Here is my real head
Here is my real head

Well I wear this fuckin' mask because you cannot handle me
Here is my real head
Well I wear this fuckin' mask because you cannot handle me
Here is my real head.
