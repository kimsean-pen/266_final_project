Make our escape, you're my own papillon
The world turns too fast
Feel love before it's gone

It kicks like a sleep twitch!
My papillon, feel love when it's shone
It kicks like a sleep twitch!

Darling, just don't put down your guns yet,
If there really was a God here,
He'd have raised a hand by now.
Now darling, you were born but you will die here,
Well that's quite enough for me
We'll find our own way home somehow.

No sense of doubt, for what you could achieve,
I'd help you out, I've seen the life you wish to leave
Well it kicks like a sleep twitch!
You will choke, choke on the air you try to breathe.
It kicks like a sleep twitch!

Darling, just don't put down your guns yet,
If there really was a God here,
He'd have raised a hand by now.
Darling, you're born, get old, and die here.
Well that's quite enough for me dear,
We'll find our own way home somehow,
How how

It kicks like a sleep twitch!
It kicks like a sleep twitch!

Darling, just don't put down your guns yet,
If there really was a God here,
He'd have raised a hand by now!
Darling, you're born, get old, and die here.
Well that's quite enough for me dear,
We'll find our own way home somehow.
It kicks like a sleep twitch!
