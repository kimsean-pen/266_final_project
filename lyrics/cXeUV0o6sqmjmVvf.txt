I can't imagine livin without you (without you)
My world would just stop spinnin without you (ooo without you)
Floating on a cloud each time you say my name
I wanna scream out loud your drivin me insane (drivin me crazy baybe)

-Chorus-
Each Time You Call I Wana Fall

Each Time We Kiss Um Fellin It

Take Full Control Please Baby Go
Deeper and Deeper and Deeper

[Verse 2]
You say you would do anything for me (for me)
You know how I kept my everything back for you (for you)
I promise I'll make sure to keep you satisfied
Just trust me baby hold me tight enjoy the ride

-Chorus 2x-

Ooo ooo Ooo
