In the tunnels of life
We hold our breath, we close our eyes

Stiff as a board to the other side
We fill our lungs and we pray for light
We fill our lungs and we pray for light

I will make it through this
Digging deep, sinking in
I'm done with everything holding, holding me down
I will make it through this
There's a time to die and a way to live
I'm not going out like this

Always smile and pretend
We want to give up, we want to give in
When hopelessness is content (yeah)
We feel our worlds caving in
We feel our worlds caving in (yeah)

I will make it through this
Digging deep, sinking in
I'm done with everything holding, holding me down
I will make it through this
There's a time to die and a way to live
I'm not going out like this
Like this, now

We are the light
We are the dream
We are everything we need
Just breathe
Just breathe
We got the strength, down to the bone
We got the grip that shapes the mold
We make our own (we make our own)
We make our own

It's all risk, don't ever regret
Taking every chance we get
To make our own, to make our own, yeah

I will make it through this
Digging deep, sinking in
I'm done with everything holding, holding me down
I will make it through this
There's a time to die and a way to live
I'm not going out like this
Like this, now

I gasp for air
It's getting thin
I'm blacking out
It's shedding skin
As I trudge forward
I believe
I feel the light lifting me

Just breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe
