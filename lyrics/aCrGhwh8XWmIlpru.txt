This isn't just another sunset, finality hangs low in the air.
The last page of a story all too
short, you can see there was a battle here.
Substance and a pain eternal, infidelity so infernal.
A friend, lover, song and a brother, taken too early by his own hand.
The poison lays on the table,
note with a final goodbye within arms reach.
If only we could see it in your eyers, so unstable.
If only you could've shared the pain with me.
If only.
You couldn't bury the pain, I couldn't save you.
You couldn't bury the pain, instead it buried you.
You couldn't bury the pain, I couldn't save you.
You couldn't bury it all.
Now I just go through the motions.
Watching it all just fade away.
Now I just go through the motions.
Taking it all day by day.
Now I just go through the motions.
Wishing that I could've noticed.
Now I just go through the motions.
March 26th, the day you left us.
Broken by the love you let too close, I couldn't see.
The pain in your heart now it lives in your mothers eyes.
And now you're gone and it's killing me.
You couldn't bury the pain, I couldn't save you.
You couldn't bury the pain, instead it buried you.
You couldn't bury the pain, I couldn't save you.
You couldn't bury it all.
Now I just go through the motions.
Watching it all just fade away.
Now I just go through the motions.
Taking it all day by day.
Now I just go through the motions
