You reward my bad behaviour
Convince yourself I never lie
But if you ignore the darkness
Then you miss the point of life
To be truly kind
Challenge my mind
Don't make it easy on me
Don't let me slide
Don't make it easy on me
Don't let me slide
I'll force myself to take it
Swallow my pride
Don't let me slide

Am I drawn to decoration?
Fascinated by twinkling lights
Am I too guided by pleasure?
Can you see the bending of my spine?
To be truly kind
Challenge my mind
Don't make it easy on me
Don't let me slide
Don't make it easy on me
Don't let me slide
I'll force myself to take it
Swallow my pride
Don't let me slide
I won't let me slide back too far
Slide back too far
Too far, too far
Too far, too far
Don't make it easy on me
