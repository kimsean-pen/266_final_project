Help yourself don't say a thing
Your love won't show and anything at all
If all you do is talk

Sadly I remain in need
Of all the things you say, believe and speak
All you do is talk

Help yourself, don't think
Help yourself, don't speak
Help yourself, don't say a thing at all
Your lucky words don't bleed

Entirely in the raw we see
You said we're on our way and I will be
Alone and everything

You say it's all we'll ever need
You find an easy way but still you weep
Alone and everything

Help yourself, don't think
Help yourself, don't speak
Help yourself, don't say a thing at all
Your lucky words don't bleed

Help yourself don't say a thing
The love you show won't mean a thing at all
If all you do is talk

Sadly we remain to see
What brings an end is also what we need
All you do is talk

Help yourself, don't think
Help yourself, don't speak
Help yourself, don't say a thing at all
Your lucky words don't bleed
