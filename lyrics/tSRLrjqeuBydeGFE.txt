Well I walked over the bridge
into the city where I live,
and I saw my old landlord.
Well we both said hello,
there was no where else to go,
'cuz his rent I couldnt afford.

Well relationships change,
oh I think it's kinda strange,
how money makes a man grow.
Some people they claim,
if you get enough fame,
you live over the rainbow.
Over the rainbow.

But the people on the street,
out on buses or on feet,
we all got the same blood flow.
Oh, in society,
every dollar got a deed,
we all need a place so we can go.
And feel over the rainbow.

But sometimes,
we forget what we got,
who we are.
Oh who are are not.
I think we gotta chance,
to make it right.
Keep it loose,
Keep it tight.
Keep it tight.

I'm in love with a girl,
who's in love with the world,
though I can't help but follow.
Though I know some day,
she is bound to go away,
and stay over the rainbow.
Gotta learn how to let her go.
Over the rainbow.

Sometimes we forget who we got,
who they are.
Oh, and who they are not.
There is so much more in love,
than black and white.
Keep it loose child,
gotta keep it tight.
Keep it loose child,
keep it tight.

Keep it tight,
keep it tight,
yaa.
