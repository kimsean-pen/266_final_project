I love myself
I was made for myself
If I kissed you I lied
I am made to be admired
You made a mistake

When you pressed
Your lips to mine
I inhale what I see
I steal what I breathe
You are mine only mine
You are mine only mine

I will swallow you
I will swallow you
You are mine only mine
I will swallow you
I will swallow you
I will swallow you
