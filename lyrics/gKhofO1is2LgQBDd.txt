I remember how it all started
Feeling warm till the summer was over
And our little lives, it felt so big then
We're only reaching stars
And I am a big black star
And you said to me

If you love me, then say you love me
And you are mine
Hey come on darling, stop the hiding
Speak your mind

Woah, I loved you
But you left me speechless then
Say if you love me, then say you love me
And you are mine

I remember how it all started
Feeling warm till the summer was over
And our little lives, it felt so big then
We're only reaching stars
And I am a big black star
And you said to me

If you love me, then say you love me
And you are mine
Hey come on darling, stop the hiding
Speak your mind

Woah, I loved you
But you left me speechless then
Say if you love me, then say you love me
And you are mine

You left me speechless
Speechless
You left me speechless

You left me speechless
Speechless
You left me speechless
Speechless

So if you love me, then say you love me
And you are mine
Hey come on darling
Speechless
