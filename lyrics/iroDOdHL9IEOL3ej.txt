I can't be further away from endless life
Oh my god stars flash before my eyes
I'm slowly fading into my memories
So slowly fading tonight's the last you'll ever see
So slowly dreaming the last time
Oh my god so many people leaving me behind
Oh my god remember all those things you tried to hide
So slowly fading tonight's the last you'll ever see
So slowly dreaming the last time
Slowly fading I know you're slowly dreaming
