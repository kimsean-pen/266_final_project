Louie, Louie
Oh baby, we gotta go
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Louie, Louie
Oh baby, we gotta go

You're my little girl, she's waiting for me
I sail a ship across the sea
On the ship you know I'm all alone
I wonder if I'll ever make it home

Louie, Louie
Oh no, we gotta go
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Louie, Louie
Oh baby, we gotta go

Three nights and days I sailed the sea
I think of girls, oh, constantly
On the ship you know I dream she's there
I smell the roses in her hair

Louie, Louie
Oh baby, we gotta go
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Louie, Louie
Oh yeah, we gotta go
Let's give it to 'em, right now!

I see the Jamaica moon above
I don't know when I'm gonna see my love
I know I'll hold her in my arms and then
I'll tell her that I'll never leave her again

Louie, Louie
Acha-cha-cha, ay
Louie, Lou
Oh, no

Louie, Louie
Oh baby, we gotta go
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
