I cling to

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Judas, Judas, Judas
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Judas, Judas, Judas

Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga-ga

When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times, he betrays me

Ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh, ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down, down

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Judas

I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his goofy way
I've learned love is like a brick, you can
Build a house or sink a dead body

Ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh, ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh
A king with no crown, king with no crown

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue
And Judas is the demon I cling to
