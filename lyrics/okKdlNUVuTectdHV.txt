You're gonna meet some strangers, welcome to the zoo
Bitter disappointments, except for one or two
Some of them are angry, some of them are mean
Most of them are twisted, few of them are clean

Now when you go dancing with young men down at the disco
Just keep it simple, you don't have to kiss though
Don't waste time whit the idiots, just think that they're heroes
They will betray you, stick with us weirdos

For all your days and nights
I'm gonna be there
I'm gonna be there, yes, I will

Go gentle through your life
If you want me I'll be there
When you need me, I'll be there for you

Don't try to make them love you, don't answer every call
Baby, be a giant, let the world be small
Some of them are deadly, some don't let it show
If they try and hurt you, just let your daddy know

Now when you go giving your heart make sure they deserve it
If they haven't earned it, keep searching it's worth it

For all your days and nights (Days and nights)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there, yes, I will

Go gentle through your life (Through your life)
If you want me, I'll be there (If you want me, I'll be there)
When you need me, I'll be there for you

Go gentle to the light (To the light)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there, yes, I will

If all your days are nights (Days are nights)
When you want me, I'll be there (When you want me, I'll be there)
Say my name, and I'll be there for you
