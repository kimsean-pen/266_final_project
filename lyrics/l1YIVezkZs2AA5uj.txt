Not in my arms, but on my mind
Yes, on my mind
But not in my arms

Time passes by and I watch her fly
Yes, I watch her fly
And time passes by

Though it's hard for me
I'm going to leave her free
'Cause that would be the best philosophy
Then she'll come to me
So I feel that to be real that

This little bird, she can fly away
No salt on her tail
No cage to make her stay

Though it's hard for me
I'm going to leave her free
'Cause that would be the best philosophy
She'll come to me
So I feel that to be real

This little bird, she can fly away
No salt on her tail
No, she can fly away

No cage to maker her stay
This little bird can fly away
