There's one who takes it all
And there's one who takes the fall
One who never wins
And there's one who stands again
There's one who lives in pain
And there's one who has no shame
There's one to tell the lies
And one to make the alibis

Round and round and round and round we go
Where we're gonna stop nobody knows

There's one who makes the rules
And there's one to play the fool
(Always a fool)
One with jealous hands
And there's one to be the friend
(Everybody needs one)
There's one who wins the fight
And there's one who sleeps at night
There's one who will stand tall
But we will all fall

Round and round and round and round we go
Where we're gonna stop nobody knows
Something's wrong, I feel it in my soul
Round and round and round and round we go

Just to find a way, just to find a way out
To find a way, just to find a way out
To find a way, just to find a way out for me

Just to find a way, just to find a way out
To find a way, just to find a way out
To find a way, just to find a way out for me

Round and round and round and round we go
(To find a way, just to find a way)
Where we're gonna stop nobody knows
(To find a way, just to find a way)
Something's wrong, I feel it in my soul
(To find a way, just to find a way)
Round and round and round and round we go

Round and round and round and round we go
Where we're gonna stop nobody knows
Something's wrong, I feel it in my soul
Round and round and round and round we go

Just to find a way, just to find a way out
To find a way, just to find a way out
To find a way, just to find a way out for me
