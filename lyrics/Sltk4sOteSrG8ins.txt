The firmament above the horizon of history,
Heathen fires burn the ancestral night.
Esoteric figures move across the Arcane plateau with their symbols engraved in the sky.

The astral plane and the lineage of the past reborn!
An abstract interwoven archive.

Languages of the gods, spoken in sidereal tongue.
Divinities of the stars.
Illuminate in runes of man.

At the creation's hollow, a sudden white light gleams,
Like a wayward sentient spirit in the mire of space and time.
Gods sire and propagate here under divine law of the opus magnum,
Evolution of a language to come.
