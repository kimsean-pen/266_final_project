Hate me
I pull my hair by the fistful
Hate me
Spinning scissors like a pistol
You dare to say that I'm forcefully insane
The truth remains that you kept me in a cage

Can't stop the beast in me
It's underneath my skin
Can't stop the beast in me
It's underneath my skin

Save
Save yourself
This is straight war
The writing's on the wall
Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
Run
Run and hide
They're keeping score
They're never coming home now
Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
No one's safe here
Run for cover
Go

Love me
They talk in pointed whispers
Love me
While my finger's on the trigger
You gave away
All the things that kept you vain
Your progeny it becomes your enemy

Can't stop the beast in me
It's underneath my skin
Can't stop the beast in me
It's underneath my skin

Save
Save yourself
This is straight war
The writing's on the wall
Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
Run
Run and hide
They're keeping score
They're never coming home now
Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
No one's safe here
Run for cover
Go

Run for cover!

Save
Save yourself
This is straight war
The writing's on the wall
Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
Run
Run and hide
They're keeping score
They're never coming home now
Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
No one's safe here
Run for cover
Go
