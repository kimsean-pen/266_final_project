One, two, three, four

Lovesick on a sunny afternoon
You are tired of staying in
You are waiting for a sign
Mayfly, woken up when skies are clear
I don't mind you coming near
Keep me company 'til she comes again

You are the one who's making do
I am the one who's privy to
'Cause you saw him in the park
'Cause you saw him at the bridges
With the people in the dark

Cana was the start of something big
You were there in the beginning
You were there to see him play
Mayfly, woken up when skies are blue
I don't mind the sight of you
Keep me company 'til she comes again

You are the one who's making do
I am the one who's privy to
'Cause you saw him at the celebration standing at the side
You had the moves to save the day
And you would love him anyway

Lovesick, it came back upon yourself
You are the one left on the shelf
You are incapable of playing the fool
Longing, so what's different today?
You sent the boys and girls away
You are concerned with matters lofty

But puzzled so it makes you sick
Your diary's looking like the bible
With it's verses lost in time
Lost in meaning for the people
Who surround you, it's a crying shame
You know it's a crying shame
You know it's a crying shame

Mayfly, woken up when skies are blue
I don't mind the sight of you
Keep me company 'til she comes again
Mayfly, woken up when skies are clear
I don't mind you coming near
Keep me company 'til she comes again
La la la la. she comes again
La la la la, she comes again
La la la la la
