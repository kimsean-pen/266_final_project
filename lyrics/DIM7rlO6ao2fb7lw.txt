I'm giving you love, why you giving up?
Grabbing your clothes off the floor and
I'm waiting for something to slow you down
Got a hotel somewhere in Hell's Kitchen
I swear a king size bed never felt so bad as it does right now

Wait a second, we just started talking
And talking turned into fighting
And fighting turned into leaving
And leaving turned into nothing, the dark
Someone's always left in the dark, mmm

Now you got me thinking 'bout the summer
How summer turned into winter
And winter turned into leaving
And leaving turned into falling apart
But I could see the light in the dark, yeah, yeah

Darling I, I re-, I remember
The first time I met ya
We're still good together
Even on our worst night
Holding on forever
Hurts for now, gets better
We're still good together
Even on our worst night

Colors of you, red and then blue
I know I get insecure 'cause I've got some shit
That you see right through
We're kinda the same, no one's to blame
I still believe in us and I know no one wants to walk away

Now you got me thinking 'bout the summer
How summer turned into winter
And winter turned into leaving
And leaving turned into falling apart
But I could see the light in the dark, yeah, yeah

You know that I, I re-, I remember
The first time I met ya
We're still good together
Even on our worst night
Holding on forever
Hurts for now, gets better
We're still good together
Even on our worst night
Even on our worst night

Darling I, I re-, I remember
The first time I met ya
We're still good together
Even on our worst night
Holding on forever
Hurts for now, gets better
We're still good together
Even on our worst night

Oh I, I remember
Even on our worst night
We're still good
Even on our worst night
