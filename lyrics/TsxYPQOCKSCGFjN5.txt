Dressin' up, dressin' up for you, for you
Dressin' up, dressin' up for you, for you

Saucer of milk
Table for two
You wanna pet my kitty?
You're such a dirty doggie
It's your lucky night
'Cause I'm in the mood
Oh, I'm feeling spicy
I'm feeling real naughty

Pick a part, you dream it up
A dark vixen, a Lolita
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

I can tell you're obsessed by your shortness of breath
Ooh, my Cookie Monster wants a taste test
Be a good boy and I'll show you the rest
Ooh, my little voyeur wants to play explorer

Pick a part, you dream it up
Librarian, dominatrix
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night)

Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you (dressin' up)

You're getting hot, so let's call the nurse
Ooh, I feel a fever
Let's take your temperature
Better behave
Or a police officer will have to hold you down
Give you what you deserve

Pick a part, you dream it up
Use your imagination
Oh boy, I'll be your fantasy
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night)

Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

Tied
Tight
Tip
Teasing
Push
Pull
Pressure
Pleasing
Beads of sweat drip down your neck
Breathing deep, gaining speed, about to peak
Trembling, trembling, trembling

Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

Dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you
I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you
I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you
