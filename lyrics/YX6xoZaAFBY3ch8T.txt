In a time of fear and confusion,
silence charging the air
The sunlight is gone, darkness lives on
in the heart of the dragon's lair

Lost in a world of illusions
No trace of the missing ore
Stealing our souls, we're out of control,
knocking at death's door

All our beliefs fading into ashes
Heed the words that we pray

For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn
Rise and conquer, let the infidels burn

Now we charge, the battle is raging,
blood runs everywhere
Our anger is fierce, avenging the years
No time for a final prayer

Behold, the might of the hammer,
elliptical bolts of fire
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You're down to the wire

Somewhere out there lies a new tomorrow
for me and those who believe

For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn
Rise and conquer, let the infidels burn
For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn
Rise and conquer, let the infidels burn

Oooh...
Now, I've returned from a place far beyond
My mission I set, let it be done
We still believe in a brighter future
The dreams are ours to fulfil
For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn
Rise and conquer, let the infidels burn
For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn
Rise and conquer, let the infidels burn
