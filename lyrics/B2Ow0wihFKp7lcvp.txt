In darkest hours
Promise you'll hold on
Promise you'll hold on
There isn't need
You feel like the world is yours
Inside everyone
Till it was snatched from your grasp
You were cast in ancient light
There's coldness in this sky
The last thing that you ever wanted was for the love to die
You're the same as all the rest
I know that we're all afraid
Of waking every day
Promise you'll hold on
Promise you'll hold on
