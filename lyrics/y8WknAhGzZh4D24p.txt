Strong enough to tell you why
I feel enough to tell you something that's very close to me
In the eye of my mind
Feel the reasons that we though
You just feel all
Falling I'm standing across the stream
Fearing saying I
I'm strong enough to find my courage
To find the way I'm always near it's brewing in my mind
Falling I'm standing across the stream
Fearing saying I
I'm strong enough to find my courage
To find the way I'm always near its growing in my mind
