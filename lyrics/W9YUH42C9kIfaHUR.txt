If I stop running to the outer edge of town,
they will find me and make me forget...
That when I wake up, two months down the line,
I would set out to do it all again.
Though I know I might not reach the end.

Don't know nothing of where these sewers lead.
I'm just guessing it's to a brighter place.
Where time moves slower and work is off the clock.
Where thoughts are happier and never under watch.
And I know I might not reach the end,
but if I try now something's bound to break
