Hot night coming
Keep the car running
Lavender fingers
Swallow my pollen

God, I fell into your spell
On the rite of god we fell
You would flash an eyelid babe
You had me howling

Caught, I swam into your skin
On a night you let me under your sin
You had me howling
You had me howling

Who oh oh, blush
Who oh oh, blush

Golden siren
Under exposing
Come lay your weakness down
On the floor in the backseat

God, I fell into your spell
On the rite of god we fell
You would flash an eyelid babe
You had me howling

Caught, I swam into your skin
On the night you led me under your sin
You had me howling
You had me howling

Who oh oh, blush
Who oh oh, blush
Who oh oh, blush
Who oh oh, blush

Under your spell
And now I'm done
Under your spell
And now I'm done

Under your spell
And now I'm done
Under your spell

(Under your spell)
(Under your spell)
Under your spell

Under your spell
And I wonder, do I, oh do I, yeah yeah
