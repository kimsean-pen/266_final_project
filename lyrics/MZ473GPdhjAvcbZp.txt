give you my heart and soul
I give you everything
put it all in your hands
now is it such a sin
uh huh round again
taking that back step one more time
oh no there she goes
look at that girl love in motion
I'm gonna follow you
anywhere you go
and when I make you mine
won't ever let you go
uh huh round again
taking that back step one more time
oh no there she goes
making it easy feel like dancing
uh huh round again
only one thing gonna change your mind
oh no there she goes
tell you that girl is love in motion
won't ever let you go
uh huh round again
taking that back step one more time
oh no there she goes
making it easy feel like dancing
uh huh round again
only one thing gonna change your mind
oh no there she goes
tell you that girl is love in motion
love in motion
uh huh round again
taking that back step one more time
oh no there she goes
look at that girl love in motion
love in motion
love in motion
uh huh
uh huh
uh huh love in motion
uh huh love in motion
uh huh
uh huh love in motion
