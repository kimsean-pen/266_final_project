Lonely
In a room of memories
From another life
Waiting and chasing
Moments that elude
Why can't I escape
Waiting and chasing
Memories of moments that are gone
When first she looked at me
And sipped her drink across from me
Newborn hell
Was it all along
Right there with me
Inside
Reflecting on the outside
If it wont die, can I
Some days i look at things
As if they never existed
And others
It's all right here
Ive been thinking aloud
About the way it went
I guess we're having a moment right now
Having a moment right now
I guess we're having a moment right now
Having a moment right
Best of them all
Best of them all
Best of them all
Best of them all
memories long gone
lately I'm thinking were they all along
What then becomes of letters never sent
In stillness yiu can hear us
Never far away
