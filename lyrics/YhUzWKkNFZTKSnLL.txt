On trial for our fates, we are the runaways
Outta place with mistakes we never made
Because all we are
To anyone is just a runaway

So fate found a day to take it all away
Cut down and encased inside a cage
Because all we are
To anyone is just a runaway

Well if the waters so deep
Then why are all of you still standing
And if the sinner's asleep
Then how can I rattle his cage
I'm so sick of these dark days chasing me further under ground
But I'll find my way to light
And you'll find your own demise

We were not born the enemy
And we will not stop for anything
So try to tell me all the things that I've done wrong
This fire will burn until we fall

(Run, run, running, I keep running, I keep on running away)
(Run, run, running, I keep running, I keep on running away)

Well how am I supposed to feel like everything will be okay
When you try to suffocate what little is left of me
So fuck off you've dug your grave and I will be just fine
Cuz I'll find my way to light, it's always been here inside

We were not born the enemy
And we will not stop for anything
So try to tell me all the things that I've done wrong
This fire will burn until we fall

So try to live with the things that you've done
And try to take all the things that I've loved
You won't break me, I will rise above
This fire will burn until we fall

Yeah, yeah
This rise of runaways

(Run, run, running, I keep running, I keep on running away)
(Run, run, running, I keep running, I keep on running away)
(Run, run, running, I keep running,
I keep on running away)
(I keep on running away, I keep on running away)

On trial for our fates, we are the runaways
Outta place with mistakes we never made
Because all we are
To anyone is just a runaway

So fate found a day to take it all away
Cut down and encased inside a cage
Because all we are
Is just a runaway

But we were not born the enemy
And we will not stop for anything
So try to tell me all the things that I've done wrong
This fire will burn until we fall

So try to live with the things that you've done
And try to take all the things that I've loved
You won't break me, I will rise above
This fire will burn until we fall

Run run running, I keep running, I keep running
Running, running, running, I keep running, I keep running
Run run running, I keep running, I keep running away

I keep on running away
I keep on running
