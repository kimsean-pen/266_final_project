Did you see those lights?
They were so bright and now i'm tongue-tied.
And now im stumbling around the riverside searching for clues to help the audience find the casing of my dead heart.
I'll get somewhere but then i'll give up.
I'm going inside
The boy i see in this rear-view mirror is not the boy i want to see.
You left me tongue-tied
I will be your tumor, i will be your tumor. ill grow and ill grow and you'll never be yourself again.
You left me hog-tied.
I can be your tumor if you just wanna pretend.
Dave, im losing interest in keeping this car on the road.
