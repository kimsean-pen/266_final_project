I just want to come home
I don't want to be alone again
There's something in my heart that says: "Don't"
But the best things in your life go

I wanna make you feel happy
I wanna make you feel glad
I only want you to be happy
But you are changing so fast

Talk to me
You wanna know something
Lets talk about everything
Oh its so hard to be
A little bit distant
When I know you're the one
For me

I just want to come home
I don't want to be alone again
There's something in the heart that says: "Don't"
But the best things in your life go

I wanna make you feel happy
I wanna make you feel glad
(Every day I just wanna see that smile)
I only want you to be happy
But you are changing so fast
(Will I be too late in a little while)

I didn't wanna write this song
I didn't wanna wait so long
You're not the only one who's heard sin
I remember how you smiled at the start
Now you're living with a broken heart
I'm sinking, all this life burning

I don't want to go slow
No time to go round again
We have never seen the skies turn blue
But I care about you

I wanna make you feel happy
I wanna make you feel glad
(Every day I just wanna see that smile)
I only want you to be happy
But you are changing so fast
(Will I be too late in a little while)
