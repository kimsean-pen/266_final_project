Under a lover's sky
Gonna be with you
And no one's gonna be around
You think that you won't fall
Well, just wait until
Til the sun goes down

Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling so right
It'll steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart
But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
It's gonna get to your heart

There's no escape from love
Once a gentle breeze
Weaves it's spell upon your heart
No matter what you think
It won't be too long
Til you're in my arms
Underneath the starlight, starlight
We'll be lost in the rhythm so right
Feel it steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart
But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
No matter what you do
The night is gonna get to you

Cannot know, cannot know
Cannot know, cannot know

Cannot know, cannot know
Don't try, girl, you're never gonna win, oh
Underneath the starlight, starlight

There's a magical feeling so right
It will steal your heart tonight
You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart
But you know but you know

That you can't fight the moonlight, no
You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart
But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
It's gonna get to your heart
