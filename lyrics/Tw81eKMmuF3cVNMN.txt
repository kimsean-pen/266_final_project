I feel like rocking
diving in tears
Water my roses with sweet liqour
Be a stranger to fears

See I only wanted to be be your girl
To love you in the ways u ever known
But you cant love me no you cant love me
If you dont even love yourself

Oh I still wanna be there
But I got more enough than reasons
To see this aint our season
I should be leavin'
These leaves dancin' in the dark

But you got my heart
And I dont want us apart baby

You're sweeter than spring
Nobody's ever been more
I know you'd give me the shirt off of your shoulders
You'd give me the world

But I only wanted to be your woman
to give you all the things i know I can
But u cant know me no you cant no me
If you dont even know yourself

Oh I still wanna be there
But I got more enough than reasons
To see this aint our season
I should be leavin'
these leaves dancin' in the dark

But somehow you got my heart
and these leaves i want 'em to fall
But these leaves I cant shake 'em off
With these leaves I cant leave at all
at all

But i should be dancing baby dancin'
yeah i should be dancing baby dancin'
Yeah i should be groovin' baby groovin' yeah I should be
moving on my own

But you got my heart
And I dont want us to part baby

We keep on blooming
You plant a smile everyday
But I could be swimming in the deep end
cause I know your ways

See I only wanted to be be your girl
To show you all the things you never known
But you cant love me no you cant love me
If you dont even know yourself

Oh i still wanna be there
But i got more enough than reasons
To see this aint our season
I should be leavin'
these leaves dancin' in the dark

but somehow you got my heart
oh baby
aw darlin'
oh c'mon baby

and i should be dancin' baby dancin'
and i should be dancin' baby dancin'
yeah i should be grooving baby groovin'
yeah i should be moving on my own
