I found the pieces in my hand
They were always there
It just took some time for me to understand
You gave me words I just can't say
So if nothing else
I'll just hold on while you drift away
'Cause everything you wanted me to hide
Is everything that makes me feel alive

The cities grow, the rivers flow
Where you are, I never know
But I'm still here
If you were right and I was wrong
Why are you the one who's gone
And I'm still here? Still here
I've seen the ashes in my heart
I smile the widest

When I cry inside and my insides blow apart
I tried to wear another face
Just to make you proud
Just to make you put me in my place
But everything you wanted from me
Is everything that I could never be
The cities grow, the rivers flow
Where you are, I never know

But I'm still here
If you were right and I was wrong
Why are you the one who's gone
And I'm still here
Maybe tonight
It's gonna be alright
I will get better

Maybe today
It's gonna be okay
I will remember
I held the pieces of my soul
I was shattered
And I wanted you to come and make me whole

Then I saw you yesterday
But you didn't notice
And you just walked away
'Cause everything you wanted me to hide
Is everything that makes me feel alive
The cities grow, the rivers flow
Where you are, I never know

But I'm still here
If you were right and I was wrong
Why are you the one who's gone
And I'm still here?
The lights go out, the bridges burn
Once you're gone, you can't return
But I'm still here
Remember how you used to say
I'd be the one to run away
But I'm still here
I'm still here
I'm still here
