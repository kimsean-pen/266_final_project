In each other's arms
At each other's throats
In the time out of mind
We buried our love
No moon to guide us tonight
No light to see us through

Let's pray for the waters to come
Let's pray
I pray, time stops, while you rot
I pray, time stops

Before the lights go out
Before our time is gone
A taste of your lips
Before we go extinct

Without control
The ark took sail
To the far beyond
Through the limits of time
No moon to guide us
Just the star of death
To lead our way

Let's pray for the waters to come
Let's pray
I pray, time stops, while you rot
I pray, time stops

Before the lights go out
Before our time is gone
A taste of your lips
Before we go extinct
