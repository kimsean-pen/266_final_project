Your love's contagious
One kiss is dangerous
I have more to risk than you to lose
I feel passion growing I know
That love is only just one inch away
It's dragging us

We live for love
We live for love

When we get tired
And watch the summer fade away
Will you think of romance?
What will we do?
Is there a place where we can go?
Where time stands still for those who know?
Till eternity we'll fulfil our desire

We live for love
We live for love
We live for love
We live for love

I never planned to win the race
But you convinced me face to face
There was never a chance of losing my all

We live for love
We live for love
We live for love
We live for love

Repeat last verse and fade.
