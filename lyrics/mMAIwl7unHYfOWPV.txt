Like ET
Selling out arenas just to see me
Wrists so icy like Fiji
Y'all already know it's the AP

Six figures, I was only four
Six figures, I was only four
So much money I can't see the floor
I don't even open my own door
I was iced out when I was four
Blew it all then I got some more
Blew it, blew it all then I got some more

Got a speeding ticket, I don't go to court
She was really lame, she made me bored
So I had to kick her out the door
I always eat at Nobu
She ask me can I come
I said, "No, boo"
She just said, "Achoo"
I ain't even say bless you

Six figures, I was only four
Six figures, I was only four
On top of the bike like ET
Sellin' out arenas just to see me

She said, "Life's not fair"
I said, "My face in Times Square"
She said, "Where?"
I said, "Right there!"
I told her she can look but not stare
Oopsies, I just crashed a boat
So many chains I might choke
I'm not even old enough to vote
Making history, you should take a note
Asked for a friend, you got a quote
My girlfriend wanted to elope
My grandma said nope
Thank god my grandpa is the pope

On top of the bike like ET
Sellin' out arenas just to see me
Wrist so icy like Fiji
Y'all already know it's the AP

Six figures, I was only four
Six figures, I was only four
So much money I can't see the floor
I don't even open my own door
I was iced out when I was four
Blew it all then I got some more
Blew it, blew it all then I got some more
