If I come from the scene of the wreckage
I look back and no one's around
Junkyard queen on the edge of the damage
Here it comes, here it comes
Sell my soul don't care what the price is
Won't matter if I go down
Burnt the sky of the blade of ashes
Here it comes, here it comes
Na na na na na na na na na
Tonight darkness finds you
Right behind you
Say your prayers
Tonight trouble finds you
It's inside you
Say your prayers tonight
Say your prayers tonight
Say your prayers tonight
Blowin' up like a bomb in the trenches
One-way ticket and I'm running from hell
Dig a grave and a bottle of leeches
Here it comes, here it comes
Na na na na na na na na na
Tonight darkness finds you
Right behind you
Say your prayers
Tonight trouble finds you
It's inside you
Say your prayers tonight
Say your prayers tonight
Say your prayers tonight
Tonight darkness finds you
Right behind you
Say your prayers
Tonight trouble finds you
It's inside you
Say your prayers tonight
Say your prayers tonight
Say your prayers tonight
