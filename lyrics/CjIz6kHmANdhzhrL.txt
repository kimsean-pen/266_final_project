Is this all a game?
I hate that you see me this way.
I am followed, I am lost.
Where I go, I'll never know.

Was it a mistake?
Too many nights are left this way.
I won't let this give me hope
You don't like to sleep alone.

You trade a taste
Like currency,
So blinded by,
Lie here awake at night.

And I knew the cost,
And I'll have no remorse,
And just like before, I'll move on.

Cuz it takes a while to stop waiting up
To get over the need,
Your loss, wasting time with you.
But I'll take a life for you
To spend my life with you,
And in the end you always leave.

It was my mistake,
To let in the pouring rain.
The window never seems to close,
I never seem to get away.

Always the same,
Proud of my distant memory
With the coming drought,
I will have to learn.

And on this road,
And in this place,
I promise that I would never play it safe.
And now you're gone,
It feels so wrong.
Just like before, I'll move on.

Cuz it takes a while to stop waiting up
To get over the need,
Your loss, wasting time with you.
But I'll take a life for you
To spend my life with you,
And in the end you al...

Emotions gone,
I swear that I've moved on,
Take me all this way,
And tonight you can stay
Cuz you know what it feels like
When you've gotten so cold on the inside.
Walking away
I guess tonight this will
Tonight
And I... I will move on.
And I will move on.
I will move on.
I will move on.

Cuz it takes a while to stop waiting up
To get over the need,
Your loss, wasting time with you.
But I'll take a life for you
To spend my life with you,
And in the end you always leave.
