I'm a waste of time and space
Drifting through my selfish ways
I don't know how I got here
Travel light endlessly
Distort all reality
I can't say how I got here

I'm a waste of time and space
Meandering unwanted days
I don't know how I got here
Entering a well known phase
I scream get lost, I hate everything
I can't say how I got here

Still, I can feel the need to change me from the inside
But I can't let anyone know just yet

If it's all the same it's time to confront this face to face
I'll be with you the whole way
It'll take time, that's fact
I'm not just another face, I'm not just another name
Even if you can't see it now
We're proud of; what is to come, and you

I'm a waste of time and space
Slipping past with getaways
I've planned for days, for weeks, for years
I'm a waste of rock and dirt
Grass and ground
And all the earth around me
Around you

Still, I can feel the need to change me from the inside
But I can't let anyone know just yet

If it's all the same it's time to confront this face to face
I'll be with you the whole way
It'll take time, that's fact
I'm not just another face, I'm not just another name
Even if you can't see it now
We're proud of; what is to come, and you
