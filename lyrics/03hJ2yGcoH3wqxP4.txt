Ooh, tell me what I could do
This ain't what it's supposed to be
I don't wanna drop it now
But you ain't up on to me
And tell me what I could to say
To make it feel right with you
'Cause you got a lot of love
And I got some things to do
And I'm just too caught up in love
Never though it could feel like this
All I need is a late night call
Got me running right back, back, back, back
I don't wanna get over you
I just wanna, offer it now

All day (all day)
All night (and all night)
You got some nerve playin' with fire
You don't (you don't), realise (no)

That I'm on my way for your satisfaction (faction)-faction
Could even have this
Call me an addict but I need your satisfaction-faction
You got that kinda somethin', fuck it's gonna make me run my mouth
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh, run my mouth
Oh-hoo, run my mouth

I tried to let you go
I came because I'm too caught up, yeah
It's because you keep calling me
All up all over me
I get stuck inside these walls that you build (Ohh, yeah)

All day (all day)
All night (and all night)
You got some nerve playin' with fire
You don't (you don't), realise (no)

That I'm on my way for your satisfaction (faction)-faction
Could even have this
Call me an addict but I need your satisfaction-faction
You got that kinda somethin', fuck it's gonna make me run my mouth
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh, run my mouth
Oh-hoo, run my mouth
You got that kinda somethin', fuck it's gonna make me run my mouth
