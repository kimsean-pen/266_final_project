She won't come down no matter what you say
she climbed a wall of sound and said you made her this way,
but tonight I need her loving hands all over me, It's a long long way but can't you see,
can't you see.
Well those tears are fresh and she can still smell you,
you see her in the flesh and don't believe that it's true,
I want you in every single way on every single day,
oh girl you better hope and.
I want you in every single way on every single day,
oh girl you better hope and.
I want you on every single day in every single way,
oh girl you better hope and pray
Don't you believe what it's like,
she holds down her head just to cry,
and you're the only one I need,
and this is the only time I'm free,
free,
don't you know she's coming right back
Your virgin passion intertwined,
you're full of speed,
your love is blind,
you're full of speed,
your love is blind,
blind,
you've got to look girl to find yeah yeah
