Always is always forever
As long as one is one
Inside yourself for your father
All is none all is none all is one

It's time we put our love behind you
The illusion has just been a dream
The valley of death and I'll find you
Now is when on a sunshine beam
So bring all the young perfection
For there us shall surely be
No clothing, tears, or hunger
You can see you can see you can be
