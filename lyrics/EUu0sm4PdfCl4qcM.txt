I've got a mask I wear at times
I think you've seen me wearing it
It's all made of wire mesh
It's got a face painted on
To make me look like someone else
- We dance so close I can't say no

And underneath I take up any other space
With an other hidden face
Beneath the traces of my own
I hope you know me and can
Put me in my place
