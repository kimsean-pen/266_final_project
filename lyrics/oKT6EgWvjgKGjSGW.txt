Well, she's walking through the clouds
with a circus mind
that's running wild
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
and fairy tales
That's all she ever thinks about...

Riding with the wind

When I'm sad she comes to me
with a thousand smiles
she gives to me free
It's alright, she says,
it's alright
Take anything you want from me,
anything
Well, she's walking through the clouds

with a circus mind
that's running wild
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
and fairy tales
That's all she ever thinks about...
Riding with the wind

When I'm sad she comes to me

with a thousand smiles
she gives to me free
It's alright, It's alright, she says,
Take anything, anything, anything, anything,
anything.
