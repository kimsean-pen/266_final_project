Open the touch, you rip my heart and all the keys
Is it not much, oh, what we've moved on?
I've got no armor, armor, armor, armor and I do not receive
And you've got nice, the only daughter in Paradise
I'm gonna keep, I know I need to get it done
Five miles deep, oh, rushing into your latest Sun
Tryina keep, keep, keep, keep 'cause I see it through
Come over me, take my love I've never seen

My love for you taste like summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Taste like the summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Taste like the summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie

Nobody sensed what we came do the other night
Drawn in the sea, oh, holding your breath before the light
Shake like never, never, never, never been in love
Under the roads if we hanging on too long
Are you a guest? Or you just don't wanna try?
Are you a bit tensed, oh, let it fly the other sky
Wait my tempo, tempo, tempo, tempo edgy inside
Slow motion crime, I want more to get you mine

My love for you taste like summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Taste like the summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Taste like the summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie

My love for you taste like summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Taste like the summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Taste like the summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
