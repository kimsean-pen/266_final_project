Eh, eh, eh, eh
No, oh, oh, oh
Eh, eh, eh, eh

You can get real close
Talkin' you talkin' now
Underneath our clothes
Pretend that we know it all
Shut off the lights just to hide in the dark, dark, dark
Think that I know you the farther you are, no

Like, A-B-C-D that could work so perfectly
If perfect was the kind of thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel nervous
Just a little bit off the edge
Even if I know that I will end up in a mess like

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
It won't be perfect but I
Know, oh, oh, oh, oh
It could be worth it and for
All of the nights I left tears running down my face
Messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh
But maybe that's what we need

See right through the fiction
And all of this fakery
Just give me some friction
Let me see what nobody sees
You don't think that I can handle the truth
Baby, I'm over just playing it cool, no

Like, A-B-C-D that could work so perfectly
If perfect was the kind of thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel nervous
Just a little bit off the edge
Even if I know that I will end up in a mess like

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
It won't be perfect but I
Know, oh, oh, oh, oh
It could be worth it and for
All of the nights I left tears running down my face
Messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh
But maybe that's what we need

That's what we need
That's what we need
Baby do you think that you could give it to me
That's what we need
That's what we need
Baby do you think that you could give it to me

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
It won't be perfect but I
Know, oh, oh, oh, oh
It could be worth it and for
All of the nights I left tears running down my face
Messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh
But maybe that's what we need

That's what we need
That's what we need
Baby do you think that you could give it to me
That's what we need
That's what we need

It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh
But maybe that's what we need
