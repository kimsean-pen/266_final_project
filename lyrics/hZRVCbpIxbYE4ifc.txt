Can't complain about everything,
This one leaves me with a permanent stain all over me.
I can't take the way you look at me.
Those eyes could never lie.
The truth will find its way out.
In time I'll pour it out,
Until then I'll keep you inside my head.
Take a look at what's beneath your feet,
Flowers that once made you smile
Have turned to stone now they're grinding down your teeth.
Walls around your mind can't keep you safe,
Build them up with steel and stone and watch your soul escape.
Get through today and know that you are secure.
Get a grasp on the fact that this is what you're here for.
You can quake at the thought of it.
Shakes you up quite a bit
And all you do is think and thinking gets you nowhere.
Just wait for clarity you say this will all make sense.
Just stay here with me.
I can't take the way you look at me.
Control, I have lost.
There's no sense in clawing myself out
And I know you can't live without taking all that's left inside my head.
Take a look at what's beneath your feet,
Flowers that once made you smile have turned to stone
Now they're grinding down your teeth.
The walls around your mind can't keep you safe,
Build them up with steel and stone and watch your soul escape, away.
