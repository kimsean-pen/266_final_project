One more time I stand by
While you choose to cross the line
I don't know why I try
Should have left it all behind
Can't go on, can't rewind
Something holds me deep inside
What's the point love a side
I have no more tears to cry
Baby, I don't need you
Especially not your lies
Never let my voice through
And wonder while I cry
Maybe that's the sound of a woman
Maybe that's the sound that a heart makes
And she's crying out to the one man
Treading her the love that she can't escape
You would understand if you listen
You wouldn't find her eyes focused on the door
Maybe that's the sound of a woman
Begging you to try just a little more!
One more time I'll ask why
You let me waste all those nights
Had I've known I have not
Let you step into my life!
We both know that I've tried
Not to leave it all behind!
Even though I explained
You still read between the lines
Baby, I don't need you
Especially not your lies
Never let my voice through
And wonder why I cry
Maybe that's the sound of a woman
Maybe that's the sound that a heart makes
And she's crying out to the one man
Treading her the love that she can't escape
You would understand if you listen
You wouldn't find her eyes focused on the door
Maybe that's the sound of a woman
Begging you to try just a little more!
If you ever see her face
Maybe you should think of her
Everything that you gave her
While I run away dumb love
If I'll ever think of her
I won't just remember words
I went through when I gave up on you!
Maybe that's the sound of a woman
Maybe that's the sound that a heart makes
And she's crying out to the one man
Treading her the love that she can't escape
You would understand if you listen
You wouldn't find her eyes focused on the door
Maybe that's the sound of a woman
Begging you to try just a little more!
Just a little more!
