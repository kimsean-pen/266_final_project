I hate my work
But I'm in control
I'm fearless now
But it cost my soul
Save yourselves
The moon is full
Under its power
Gravitational pull

Blood red lips
They shake like leaves
You're flesh and blood
But what's underneath?

Don't turn out the lights
Kiss yourself goodnight cause there's a killer
And he's coming after you
Kiss yourself goodnight
Tonight 'cause there's a killer and he's coming after you

It's alright to scream
I'm screaming too
Why'd you think I do the things I do?
For shadows haunted me like ghosts
So I became what I feared the most

I conduct fear like electricity
A manmade monstrosity

Don't turn out the lights
Kiss yourself goodnight cause there's a killer
And he's coming after you
Kiss yourself goodnight
Tonight 'cause there's a killer and he's coming after you

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Don't turn out the lights
Kiss yourself goodnight cause there's a killer
And he's coming after you
Kiss yourself goodnight
Tonight 'cause there's a killer and he's coming after you

Don't turn out the lights
Kiss yourself goodnight
Cause theres a killer and he's coming after you
Don't turn out the lights
Tonight 'cause there's a killer

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
