Welcome this is a farmhouse.
We have cluster flies alas,
and this time of year is bad.
We are so very sorry
there is little we can do but swat them.

She didn't beg on enough,
she didn't stay when things got tough.
I told a lie and she got mad,
she wasn't there when things got bad.

I never ever saw the northern lights,
I never really heard of cluster flies,
I never ever saw the stars so bright.
In the farmhouse things will be alright.
I never ever saw the northern lights,
I never really heard of cluster flies,
I never ever saw the stars so bright.
In the farmhouse things will be alright.
alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.

Woke this morning to the stinging lash
every man rise from the ash
each betrayal begins with trust
every man returns to dust.

I never ever saw the northern lights,
I never really heard of cluster flies,
I never ever saw the stars so bright.
In the farmhouse things will be alright.
I never ever saw the northern lights,
I never really heard of cluster flies,
I never ever saw the stars so bright.
In the farmhouse things will be alright.
