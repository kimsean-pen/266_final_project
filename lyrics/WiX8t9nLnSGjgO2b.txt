I'm loving, living every single day
But sometimes I feel so
I hope to find a little piece of mind
And I just want to know
And who can here those tiny broken hearts
And what are we to be
Where is home on the milky way of stars
I dry my eyes again

In my dreams I am not
So far away from home
What am I in a world
So far away from home
All my life all the time
So far away from home
Without you I will be
So far away from home

If we could make it through the darkest night
We have a brighter day (have a brighter day)
The world I see beyond your pretty eyes
Makes me want to stay (you make me wanna stay)
And who can here those tiny broken hearts
And what are we to be
Where is home on the milky way of stars
I dry my eyes again

In my dreams I am not
So far away from home
What am I in a world
So far away from home
All my life all the time
So far away from home
Without you I will be
So far away from home

I count on you
No matter what they say
Cause love can find its time
I hope to be a part of you again (a part of you)
Baby let a sign
And who can here those tiny broken hearts
And what are we to be (what are we to be)
Where is home on the milky way of stars (milky way of stars)
I dry my eyes again (dry my eyes)

In my dreams I am not
So far away from home (far away from home)
What am I in a world
So far away from home (far away)
All my life all the time
So far away from home (far away from home)
Without you I will be
So far away from home

In my dreams I am not
So far away from home
What am I in a world
So far away from home
All my life all the time
So far away from home
Without you I will be
So far away from home
