Carpatian Forest
where trees are endless
Forest tightens fall to rest
And death is made for the queen,
Mushrooms gather in circles.
Where bears walk, Â¿they religion's basis is dark spirits?
I'm coming,
Falls deep into darkness.
Stones rise in circles
Where drums roar;
Water whispers vibrating,
People dance under the moon, in circles.
Bone to ruin and sculpted dust.
I smell the thoughts of the gods.
Roots, promieses blossom.
