Tonight I feel like I just don't wanna let it go
And hang with a crowd that I don't even know
So I don't lose my mind
Back home, the words that I hear are so predictable
They fuck with my mind and make me miserable
They gotta know first hand
They wanna understand

What happened to your band?
What are your future plans?
I'm like your biggest fan

Where'd you go?
I've been lost without you
It's crazy, time moves slow
I ain't seen you on the TV lately

I walk through the neighbourhood where I used to live
But the only thing that people ask me is
What happened to your band?
What happened to your band?

What happened to your band?
What are your future plans?
I'm like your biggest fan

Where'd you go?
I've been lost without you
It's crazy, time moves slow
I ain't seen you on the TV lately

Where'd you go?
I've been lost without you
It's crazy, time moves slow
I ain't seen you on the TV lately

Where'd you go?
I've been lost without you
It's crazy, time moves slow
I ain't seen you on the TV lately

Where'd you go? (What happened to your band?)
I've been lost without you
It's crazy, time moves slow (What are your future plans?)
I ain't seen you on the TV lately

Where'd you go? (I'm like your biggest fan)
I've been lost without you
It's crazy, time moves slow (What happened to your band?)

I've been lost without you
It's crazy, time moves slow (What happened to your band?)
