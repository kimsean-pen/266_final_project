Now tell me the truth
Don't make me wait too long
You have to prove that I shouldn't move on

I'm sitting here watching the tick of the clock
I hear my own heartbeat
I want it to stop
Doing next to nothing
Except breaking apart
And this tension just cuts to the bone

Get out or give me good reason
Shut up, I'll do it alone
And I wont waste another year sitting here
Waiting for something more (More)

So I'm just stuck here in the meantime
Waiting on the other line

Now tell me the truth
Don't make me wait too long
You have to prove that I shouldn't move on
Giving in is the price I pay
These words alone
Hurt enough to walk away
You think I hang on everything you say
And worst of all you're predictable

I really must be moving onward to something
I'm standing right here and I came from nothing
The harder you fall
The more pain you can take

You love when the pressure just pulls me apart
You're fueling the fire
It just won't stop
It kept growing and burning
And taking my world down in flames
While I'm waiting on the other line

Now tell me the truth
Don't make me wait too long
You have to prove that I shouldn't move on
Giving in is the price I pay
These words alone
Hurt enough to walk away
You think I hang on everything you say
And worst of all you're predictable

You're breaking the ground that you walk on
No one around you is safe
Your thoughts are as loud as a shotgun
They keep blowing me away

So I'm just stuck here in the meantime
Waiting on the other line

Now tell me the truth
Don't make me wait too long
You have to prove that I shouldn't move on
Giving in is the price I pay
These words alone
Hurt enough to walk away
You think I hang on every word you say
And worst of all you're predictable (Oh oh oh oh)

So I'm just stuck here in the meantime
Waiting on the other line
