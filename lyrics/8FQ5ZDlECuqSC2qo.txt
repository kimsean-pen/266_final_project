Conceived was I
From chaos and hate
Of malice, deceit and blood
And how would they know
My fate is to rise
Against the asagods
My being is full, full of a rage
An evil that can't be tamed
It darkens my soul
And blackens the blood
A fire that fills my veins

So how
Did I ever end up here?
Humiliated, broken and weak
I've waited
For a thousand years
To break these chains apart and
To finally break myself free

I bit the hand, off the mighty Tyr
When i couldn't, tare my ties
Now banished i dwell
A sword in my jaw
Awaiting the end of time
In darkness I drown
Consumed by my hate
Longing for revenge
Allfather will pay
For his deceit
At the battle
Of Ragnar√∂k

A beast am I
So vicious and grim
They fear my mean
Grinning teeth
I bide my time
My sweet revenge
Soon my ties will fall
And finally i will by free

So when you hear me howling
You'll know that i have come for you
When you hear me call your name
Your life will end in nameless pain

Conceived was I
From chaos and hate
Of malice, deceit and blood
And how would they know
My fate is to rise
Against the asagods
My being is full, full of a rage
An evil that can't be tamed
It darkens my soul
And blackens the blood
A fire that fills my veins

A beast am I
So vicious and grim
They fear my mean
Grinning teeth
I bide my time
My sweet revenge
Soon my ties will fall
And finally I will be
Finally break myself!
Finally I will be free!
