My breath was cuming fast
And as I make a start
You turn to go
Oh, oh
I'll do what you want me to

I'll cry at the thought of the loss of a heart
Love is reason
Love is reason
Love is reason

Love is reason enough
My morals are changing fast
I told you it wouldn't last
You turn and go
Oh, oh

I'll be what you want me to be
I'd die at the thought of the loss of your heart
Love is reason
Love is reason

Love is reason

Love is reason enough

Oh, love is reason enough
I'll cry at the thought of the loss of a heart
Love is reason
Love is reason
Love is reason
Love, love is reason enough
Love is reason
Love is reason enough
Love is reason
Love is reason enough
