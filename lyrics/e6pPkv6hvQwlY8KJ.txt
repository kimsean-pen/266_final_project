You are the reason that I lied
You are the reason that I tried
Please don't wait until tomorrow
There's only pain, hate, greed and sorrow

Don't ask the evil things of me
600 years will set us free
Don't have the strength to face the horrors
Don't put your faith in thoughts you borrowed

I'll cut your throat in the night
I'll stab your back and hunt you tonight

We ran away from all your kin
When everything is caving in
We will need eternal slumber
When bombs and gas will feed the hunger

I'll cut your throat in the night
I'll stab your back and hunt you tonight

I'll cut your throat in the night
I'll stab your back and run through the night
