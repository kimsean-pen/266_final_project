I'm waiting
For the perfect time to call you back
'Cause I remember saying
Don't wanna know the truth
Can't handle that

And I try to just forget you
But I don't know how
If only I knew

It's written all over your face
Such a painful thing to waste
Tell me now
Where do we go
Now the future's not so clear
I can't believe we've ended here
Where's the world that doesn't care

Maybe I could meet you there

I'm sorry
If I slagged you down
I meant no harm
When I heard the stories
Said things I didn't mean
Should have stayed calm
But sadly
You got angry
And it breaks my heart
You're so mad at me

Its written all over your face
Such a painful thing to waste
Tell me now
Where do we go
Now the future's not so clear
I can't believe we've ended here
Where's the world that doesn't care

Maybe I could meet you there
Maybe I could meet you there
Maybe I could meet you there

Its written all over your face
Such a painful thing to waste
Tell me now
Where do we go
Now the future's not so clear
I can't believe we've ended here
Where's the world that doesn't care

Maybe I could meet you there
Maybe I could meet you there
Maybe I should meet you there
