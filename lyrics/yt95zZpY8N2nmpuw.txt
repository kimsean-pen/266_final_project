Hey, everybody let's go
Downtown to the ska show
There's a ska show, come on, let's go
Let's go

We wanna dance and sing
And forget about everything
Don't wanna fight or cry
Just have some fun before we die

And there's never any doubt
That's what it's all about

Hey, everybody let's go
Downtown to the ska show
There's a ska show, come on, let's go
Let's go

This invitation is for all
It doesn't matter who you are
It don't matter where you're from
'Cause everybody is welcome

And there's never any doubt
That's what it's all about

If we don't have fun then what are we livin' for?
If we don't have fun then why are we here?
If we don't have fun then what are we livin' for?
I don't wanna take the chance that there's anything more
Have a good time all the time and we'll be fine
We'll be fine
