I go outside and see all these things that should be real
Come on you're a part of it can you [?] but can you feel
You're not the same as me but I know we share a thing

I can feel your pain, and I feel alright about it

We're moving quickly to sun
I feel there's nothing left to say
A simple life could be so strange
Refuse to [?]

You know there's nothing left to say
