She drove a long way through the night
From an urban neighborhood
She left her mother in a fight
For a dream misunderstood
And her friends they talk on corners
They could never comprehend

But there was always something different
In the way she held a stare
And the pictures that she painted
Were of glamour and of flair
And her boyfriend though he loved her
Knew he couldn't quite fulfill
He could never meet her there

She's never gonna be like the one before
She read it in her stars
That there's something more
No matter what it takes
No matter how she breaks
She'll be the Queen of Hollywood

And the cynics they will wonder
What's the difference with this dream
And the dreams of countless others
All believing in TV
They see their handprints in a sidewalk
Flashing cameras on the scene
And a shining limousine

She's never gonna be like the one before
She read it in her stars
That there's something more
No matter what it takes
No matter how she breaks
She'll be the Queen of Hollywood

She's believing in a dream
It's a loaded fantasy

Now her mother collects cut-outs
And the pictures make her smile
But if she saw behind the curtain
It could only make her cry
She's got hand prints on her body
Sad moonbeams in her eyes
Not so innocent a child

She's never gonna be like the one before
She read it in her stars
That there's something more
No matter what it takes
No matter how she breaks
She'll be the Queen of Hollywood

No, she's never gonna be like the one before
She read it in her stars
That there's something more
No matter what it takes
And even though she breaks
She'll be the Queen of Hollywood

She's the Queen of Hollywood
Queen of Hollywood
Her friends still talk on corners
She's the Queen of Hollywood
Queen of Hollywood
