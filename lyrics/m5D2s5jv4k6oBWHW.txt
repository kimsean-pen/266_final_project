Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go
The more I think about
The more I want to let you know...
That everything you do
Is super fucking cute
And I can't stand it

I've been searching for
A girl that's just like you
Cause I know
That your heart is true

Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go
The more I think about
The more I want to let you know...
That everything you do
Is super duper cute
And I can't stand it

You
Just to make it through...
Another year
You, I saw you across the room
And I knew that this was gonna

Blossom into something beautiful.
You're beautiful.
Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go
The more I think about
The more I want to let you know...
That everything you do

Is super duper cute
And I can't stand it
Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go

The more I think about
The more I want to let you know
That everything you do
Is super duper cute
And I can't stand it
And I can't stand it
No I can't stand it
