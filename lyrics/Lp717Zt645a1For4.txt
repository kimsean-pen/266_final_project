If we've got something going
Tell me why is he here?
You leave me hanging by a thread
When the lion is near

I'm not about to drop the ball
You clearly cannot stay

Why can't you see with my hands
Holding your eyes open?
It's hard for me to think
When your mouth is always moving

Keep yourself quiet now
Just be quiet, just be quiet now

Well, you could have been all I wanted
And all that I need
But you had to leave 'cause it's so easy
To fall in love with machines

I'm not about to drop the ball
You clearly cannot stay

Why can't you see with my hands
Holding your eyes open?
It's hard for me to think
When your mouth is always moving

Shut up, sit down, find your way out
Just leave me alone
You can't make me believe
That you have changed at all

Go away, no, please stay
Go away, no, stay, stay away
Go away, no, please stay
Go away, no, stay, stay

Why can't you see with my hands
Holding your eyes open?
It's hard for me to think
When your mouth is always moving

Shut up, sit down, find your way out
Just leave me alone
You can't make me believe
That you have changed at all
