When I go on airplanes
I listen to your voice
And when I go to sleep at night
I'm wishing for a choice

To go back in time
Make what's wrong feel right
To go back in time
Make what's wrong feel right
Feel right

All the things I'm taking
Are making me insane
And when I go to sleep at night
I'm wishing for a change

To go back in time
Make what's wrong feel right
To go back in time
Make what's wrong feel right
Feel right

My mom was right
I don't wanna die
I wanna live my life
My mom was right
I don't wanna die
I wanna live my life

My life, my life, my life, my life,
My life, my life, my life, my life,
My life
