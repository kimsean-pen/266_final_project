Ophelia was a bride of God
A novice Carmelite
In sister cells the cloister bells
Tolled on her wedding night

Ophelia was the rebel girl
A blue stocking suffragette
Who remedied society
Between her cigarettes

And Ophelia was the sweetheart
To a nation overnight
Curvaceous thighs, vivacious eyes
Love was at first sight, love was at first sight
Love

Ophelia was a demi-goddess
In pre-war babylon
So statuesque a silhouette
In black satin evening gowns

Ophelia was the mistress to
A vegas gambling man
Signora Ophelia Maraschino
Mafia courtesan

Ophelia was the circus queen
The female cannonball
Projected through five flaming hoops
To wild and shocked applause
To wild and shocked applause

Ophelia was a tempest cyclone
A goddamn hurricane
Your common sense, your best defense
They wasted and in vain

For Ophelia'd know your every woe
And every pain you'd ever had
She'd sympathize and dry your eyes
Help you to forget, and help you to forget
And help you to forget

Ophelia's mind went wandering
You'd wonder where she goes
Through secret doors down corridors
She wanders there alone, all alone

Es kostet mich keine kleine krise die verunreinigung und das
Es kostet mich keine kleine Krise die Verunreinigung und das
Suechtige aus meinem Leben auszuschliessen
But it is for me no little effort to exclude
The polluting and the addictive from my life

Compondo musica en un estado de ecstases
Composing music in a state of ecstasy
Fuerza de vida, de vida
Strength of life, of life
