Holding back, feeling my moral fiber sink into the deeper end
Pouring sugar down the drain, I stand to face the acts
Nightlife friends wondering have I missed my chance
I shake the second guess
Smoking, doing my own thing
I let the moment pass
I let the moment pass
I can't figure it out
Is it smoke or steam?
Facing where we are
And everywhere, we are nowhere near
We are wounded and open
Wondering will we heal
Or if nothing else, feel wrapped up in ourselves while we are here
Signals fill my room with static ringing glass
It spreads an emptiness
I am awake around their trap
Burning life for paper
Balancing the act
I see the shape of things
I see the patches in the grass and all the falling limbs
And all the falling limbs
I can't figure it out
Is it smoke or steam?
Facing where we are
And everywhere, we are nowhere near
We are wounded and open
Wondering will we heal
Or if nothing else, feel wrapped up in ourselves while we are here
