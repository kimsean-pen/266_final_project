summer days were just a magazine, a magazine
a magazine...

cutting grass for gasoline, for gasoline
so i can see ya soon...

fall swooned
left me drunk in a field
dandelion wine for a year

and i packed up the dust
of all that i owned
handkerchief hung from a pole

i rolled out the day that the apples fell...
