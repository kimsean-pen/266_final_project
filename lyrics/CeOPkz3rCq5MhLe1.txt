Your strength is so hard to find
I feel so much stronger now
the feeling's alright
Your words make me whole again
Those eyes cannot ever lie
you're so divine

I'm not ever alone
You're not ever alone

I'm head over heels goddess of mine
Your curls touching my face and now I can fly
You brought my life back
the glory you found
I'm in deep debt, without you I wouldn't survive

I'm not ever alone

Your smile is heavenly
I don't deserve all the love that your giving to me
Your touch makes it hard to breathe
the shiver's around me now, you're so fine

I'm head over heels goddess of mine
your curls touching my face and now I can fly
You brought my life back
the glory you found
I'm in deep debt, without you I wouldn't survive

The heart is pumping for my life
the mind is happy and I,
I will love you 'til the day I die

I'm head over heels goddess of mine
your curls touching my face and now I can fly
You brought my life back
the glory you found
I'm in deep debt, without you I wouldn't survive

I'm head over heels goddess of mine
your curls touching my face and now I can fly
You brought my life back
the glory you found
I'm in deep debt, without you I wouldn't survive
