I met you somewhere
In a air beneath the stairs
There's someone in that room
That frightens you when they go, boo

Boo, boo, boo
Boo, boo, boo
Boo, boo, boo
Boo, boo, boo

The color you say is black
Is the one you might lack
In the sights of your eyes
Is there a righteous prize?

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I met you, I met you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

There's something wrong with our hearts
When they need care they stand apart
In the bland moonlight watch this seabird fall
Real love it finds you somewhere with your back to it

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I met you, I met you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You know, you know we belong
By the stream to the dawn
You know, you know we belong
By the stream to the dawn

You know, you know we belong
By the stream to the dawn
You know, you know we belong
By the stream to the dawn
