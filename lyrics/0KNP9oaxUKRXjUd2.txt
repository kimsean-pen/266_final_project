everybody's talking bout' revolution
everybody's talking bout' smash the state
sounds to me like the final solution
right wing, left wing full of hate

(Chorus)
we don't wanna fight
because you tell us to
so watch your back when you attack
cuz we might just turn on you

things get worse with every hour
the future fades into the past
all they want is total power
climbing on the backs of the working class

Chorus x2

we don't wanna be part of no new religion
we don't wanna be part of a political dream
we just wanna get on living our lives

Chorus x2
