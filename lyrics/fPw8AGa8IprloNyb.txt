Looking in the mirror
Don't like what I see
What happened to my dreams
And what happened to me?
I'm looking for
I'm looking for
I'm looking
I'm gonna go find me

Reaching for a reason
A reason to stay here
But nothing's convincing
I'm leaving with no fear
I'm looking for
I'm looking for
I'm looking
I'm gonna go find me
I'm gonna go find me

I'm gonna go into the wild
I'll leave everything behind
I follow the stars
In throwaway time
Dancing with wolves in my kingdom of dreams
Baby, it's a wildlife
Baby, I'm a wild child
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby, I'm a wild child
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby, I'm a wild child
Dancing with wolves in my kingdom of dreams
Baby, it's a wildlife
Baby, I'm a wild child

Nothing feels real here
Everything's a blur
I hear myself saying
Things I never heard
I'm looking for
I'm looking for
I'm looking
I'm gonna go find me
I'm gonna go find me

I'm gonna go into the wild
I'll leave everything behind
I follow the stars
In throwaway time
Dancing with wolves in my kingdom of dreams
Baby, it's a wildlife
Baby, I'm a wild child
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby, I'm a wild child
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby, I'm a wild child
Dancing with wolves in my kingdom of dreams
Baby, it's a wildlife
Baby, I'm a wild child

Into the night leave my shadows behind
As the sun's asleep, I'll get lost in the dark
Wondering, not knowing what's out there for me
Baby, it's a wildlife
Baby, I'm a wild child

I'm gonna go into the wild
I'll leave everything behind
I follow the stars
In throwaway time
Dancing with wolves in my kingdom of dreams
Baby, it's a wildlife
Baby, I'm a wild child
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby, I'm a wild child
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby, I'm a wild child
Dancing with wolves in my kingdom of dreams
Baby, it's a wildlife
Baby, I'm a wild child
