You can have my autograph
I think I'll sign it love to you
But should I sign it just for you

Stairway to the stars, I think I'll write good health to you
Stairway to the stars, we got better things to do

You can drive my motorcar
It's insured to thirty thou
Kill them all if you wish

Stairway to the stars, I think I'll write good health to you
Stairway to the stars, we got better things to do

You can have my autograph
I think I'll sign it good health to you
Upon the cast, your broken arm

Stairway to the stars, I think I'll write good health to you
Stairway to the stars, I hope you heal up real quick
Stairway to the stars...

Come on, let's get on outa here.
