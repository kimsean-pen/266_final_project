Saw you leanin' against that old record machine
Saw the name of your band written on the marquee
It's a full moon tonight so we gettin' rowdy
Yeah, we gettin' rowdy, get-get-gettin' rowdy

Feelin' like I'm a high schooler
Sippin' on a warm wine cooler
Hot, 'cause the party don't stop
I'm in a crop top, like I'm workin' at Hooters
We been keepin' it PG
But I wanna get a little frisky
Come gimme some of that, yum like a lollipop
Let me set you free

Come on, 'cause I know what I like
And you're lookin' just like my type
Let's go for it, just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Now don't even try to deny
We're both going home satisfied
Let's go for it, just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Write our names on the wall in the back of the bar
Steal some bubblegum from the corner Meximart
Now we laughin' like kids causin' trouble in the dark
Causin' trouble in the dark
T-T-Trouble in the dark

Feelin' like a sabretooth tiger
Sippin' on a warm Budweiser
Touch me, gimme that rush
Better pack a toothbrush
Gonna pull an all nighter
We been keepin' it kosher
But I wanna get it on fo' sure
Come gimme some of that, yum like a lollipop
Baby, don't be scared

Come on, 'cause I know what I like
And you're lookin' just like my type
Let's go for it, just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Now don't even try to deny
We're both going home satisfied
Let's go for it, just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

I don't wanna go to sleep
I wanna stay up all night
I wanna just screw around
I don't wanna think about
What's gonna be after this
So I wanna just live right now

I don't wanna go to sleep
I wanna stay up all night
I wanna just screw around
I don't wanna think about
What's gonna be after this
So I wanna just live right now

Come on, 'cause I know what I like
And you're lookin' just like my type
Let's go for it, just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Now don't even try to deny
We're both going home satisfied
Let's go for it, just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
