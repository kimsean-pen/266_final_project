Diamonds in our eyes
It's like we've seen each other for the first time
But forever is a long time
And I don't plan to be around for the whole ride

My friends say it's a dope idea
But now it's become crystal-meth clear
It's a long ride

We are just two kids
We're looking for something to hold on to
We are just two kids
We're looking for something to hold on to

I thought it was just for the fun
You held my face, said I was the one
Oh, oh it was funny
And it drove me to tears
To think a boy like you could think so far ahead

My friends say it's a dope idea
But now it's become crystal-meth clear
But now, It's a long ride

We are just two kids
We're looking for something to hold on to
We are just two kids
We're looking for something to hold on to

It's me and you-ooh (It's me and you)
It's me and you-ooh (It's me and you)
It's me and you-ooh (It's me and you)
It's me and you-ooh (It's me and you)

We are just two kids
We're looking for something to hold on to
We are just two kids
We're looking for something to hold on to
