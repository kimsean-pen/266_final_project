Drank away the rest of the day, I wonder what my liver'd say
Drink, that's all you can
Blackened days with their bigger gales blow in your parlor to discuss the day
Listen, that's all you can

Oh, but don't, no, don't sink the boat
That you built, you built to keep afloat
No, don't, don't sink the boat
That you built

Sick and tired of what to say, no one listens anyway
Sing, that's all you can
Rambling years of lousy luck, you miss the smell of burning turf
Dream, that's all you can

Oh, but don't, no, don't sink the boat
That you built, you built to keep afloat
No, don't, don't sink the boat
That you built, that you built to keep afloat

Singled out for who you are, it takes all types to judge a man
Feel, that's all you can
Filthy suits with bigot ears hide behind their own worst fears
Live, that's all you can

It's all you can
It's all you can do

No matter where I put my head, I'll wake up feeling sound again
Breathe, that's all you can
Tomorrow smells of less decay, the flowers greet this blooming fray
Be thankful, that's all you can

Oh, but don't, no, don't sink the boat
That you built, you built to keep afloat
No, don't, no, don't sink the boat
That you built, that you built to keep afloat

No, don't, no, don't sink the boat
That you built, that you built to keep afloat

A ripe old age, a ripe old age
I'm a ripe old age, that's what I am
I'm a ripe old age, a ripe old age
A ripe old age, just doing the best I can
A ripe old age, a ripe old age
A ripe old age, that's what I am
A ripe old age, a ripe old age
A ripe old age, just doing the best I can
The best I can
