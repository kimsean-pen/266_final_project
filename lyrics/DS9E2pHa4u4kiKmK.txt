You broke some bones when we were young
I can remember how you moaned
So I carried you home
Like a baby

You were thirteen
And I was twelve
I can remember how it felt
Wearing your broken body on
Like a lady

Ohhh, hahhh-hah

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
If ever you need me
Just call me
I'll carry you home

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
If ever you're broken
No reason to do it alone

We were both five
You started a fire
And for a moment, all was lost
But then the rain fell from the sky
It was magic

Couldn't believe
How it came down
Puddles of water all around
But when the clouds were finally gone
It seemed tragic

Ohhh, hahhh-hah

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
If ever you need me
Just call me
I'll carry you home

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
If ever you're broken
No reason to do it alone

Spoken: Baby, I know we've seen our share of hard times, you and me.
But I want you to know that I will always, no matter what,
come to you--out of the mist or into the fire,
across the sea, the mountains, the desert.
And if you need me, just call me and I will carry you all the way home.

Ohhh, hahhh-hah

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
If ever you need me
Just call me
I'll carry you home

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
If ever you're broken
No reason to do it alone
