As I sit in this smokey room
The night about to end
I pass my time with strangers
But this bottle's my only friend

Remember when we used to park
On Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat

Remember when we used to talk about busting out
We'd break their hearts, together, forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends, hoping it would never end
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we got to try,
holdin' on to never say goodbye

Remember days of skipping school
Racing cars and being cool
With a six pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go

Remember at the prom that night
You and me, we had a fight
But the band they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong

We danced so close, we danced so slow
And I swore I'd never let you go, together, forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends,
hoping it would never end
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we got to try,
holdin' on to never say goodbye

I guess you'd say we used to talk about busting out
We'd break their hearts, together, forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends,
hoping it would never end
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we got to try,
holdin' on to never say goodbye
