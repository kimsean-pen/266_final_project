A serpent, a rabbit
A walk in the forest
A tentative looking son
A feeling, a moment
A bursting of bubbles
A panic to overcome

A samurai, an angel
An eloquent table
An AC that does not work
A road trip, a car wreck
A paperback novel
A lover who ain't been hurt

When you let me go
And I'm on my way
When the world below
Is cold and gray

On the verge of
On the verge of something wonderful
A resurgence
On the edge of something wonderful

For it, against it
Said he never meant it
But Harry still dropped the bomb
A trip to, the dentist
The Hollywood blacklist
A moment that time forgot

When you let me go
And I'm on my way
When the world below
Is cold and gray

On the verge of
On the verge of something wonderful
On the edge of
On the verge of something wonderful

You can dance in the devil's shoes
If you like walking in heels
And there's a decent living to be made
In the selling out of ideals
You can lose your way in the big city
Get distracted and lost in being pretty

I want you, I need you
I don't wanna please you
Or belong to anyone
But life is, for leading
For not people pleasing
A race that has never been won

When you let me go
And I'm on my way
When the world below
Is cold and grey

On the verge of
On the verge of something wonderful
On the edge of
On the verge of something wonderful
On the verge of
On the verge of something wonderful
A resurgence
On the edge of something wonderful
