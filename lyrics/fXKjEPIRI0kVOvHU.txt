I don't wanna see you or feel you
I don't wanna look into your eyes
I don't wanna touch you or miss you
I just wanna love your memory tonight

I can't handle all this pain
All we ever do is fight anyway
Why we even tried I haven't a clue
With hearts involved there's way too much to lose

I don't wanna see you or feel you
I don't wanna look into your eyes
I don't wanna touch you or miss you
I just wanna love your memory tonight

You were something else to look at
Your intentions they weren't all bad
You tried to make me something I wasn't
Lord knows there ain't no future in all that

I don't wanna see you or feel you
I don't wanna look into your eyes
I don't wanna touch you or miss you
I just wanna love your memory tonight
