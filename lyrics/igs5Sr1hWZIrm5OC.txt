We used to be kids in the backseat wastin' time
Talkin' 'bout high hopes and daydreams
Never thought love, never thought life
Could take us far beyond what we believed
As long as I got your love next to me
I'm better than I used to be

I been chasin' this dream
I'm so glad you understand it
Climbing up a mountain, it will leave you hardly standing
Things don't go just the way you planned it
But I never thought we'd have, so much to take for granted

You never know what you got till it's gone
Guess I never know cause I know you're my only one

We used to be kids in the backseat wastin' time
Talkin' 'bout high hopes and daydreams
Never thought love, never thought life
Could take us far beyond what we believed
As long as I got your love next to me
I'm better than I used to be
Better than I used to be

It's been a long day alone
And I can hardly stand it
My plane leaves tomorrow
But my heart has already landed
Things didn't go, just the way I planned it
But I never thought we'd have, so much to take for granted

You never know what you got till it's gone
Guess I never know cause I know you're my only one

We used to be kids in the backseat wastin' time
Talkin' 'bout high hopes and daydreams
Never thought love, never thought life
Could take us far beyond what we believed
As long as I got your love next to me
I'm better than I used to be
Better than I used to be
Better than I used to be
Better than I used to be

We used to be kids in the backseat wastin' time
Talkin' 'bout high hopes and daydreams
Never thought love, never thought life
Could take us far beyond what we believed
As long as I got your love next to me
I'm better than I used to be
