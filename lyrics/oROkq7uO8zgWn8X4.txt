I love visual pleasure, oh
Measuring me, checking on my real behavior, oh
What do you see Mr. Regulator?
I don't need no savior
So do yourself a favour
And get over, over it
'Cause I won't be that girl when
Even little Miss Perfect's judged by everybody

You say I'm faulty, faulty, faulty
Why don't you get the fuck out of my way, give me backache?
If you're looking for a guarantee, you'll be better off with a machine
Faulty, faulty, faulty

We gon' mutualtion, oh 'cause everyone's not on display
Losing real [?] sensation, oh
My real days is blind admiration
On some bull foundation
All these obligations
Oh, get over, get over it
'Cause I won't be that girl when
Even little Miss Perfect's judged by everybody

You say I'm faulty, faulty, faulty
Why don't you get the fuck out of my way, give me backache?
If you're looking for a guarantee you'll be better off with a machine
Faulty, faulty, faulty

A bitch I might be
A bitch I might be
A bitch I might be
