All you mothers and you brothers and you sisters and you fathers
And everybody walkin' this land
No matter your race, your creed, your tribe
Whose nation you defend
With open hearts and open minds lend a helping hand each time
To the mothers and the brothers and the sisters and the fathers
Everybody walkin' this land

All you believers, pretenders, bonafide sinners
Everybody walkin' this land
No matter your church, your faith, your sign
Whose lying in your den
All seeing eyes and Jesus Christ
We're all living in a paradise
With believers, pretenders, bonafide sinners
Everybody walkin' this land

Lord we pray we make it through the day
All you mothers, you brothers, you sisters, you fathers
Believers, pretenders, bonafide sinners
Everybody walkin' this land

All you racists, fascists, nihilists, and bigots
I'm calling you out my friend
I felt your hurt, drank your fear
Your actions will not stand
Get on your knees, begin to pray
Look at me, you can change
You racists, fascists, nihilists, and bigots
I'm calling you out my friend

Lord we pray we make it through the day
You racists, fascists, nihilists, and bigots
We pray for you my friend
All you prophets, saints, angels, and ladies
And all you gentlemen
We walked on fire, and we fought through Hell
We're soldiers 'til the end
If you can't get enough,
Don't think that devil won't fill your cup
All you mothers, you brothers, you sisters, you fathers
You believers, pretenders, bonafide sinners
Racists, fascists, nihilists, and bigots
Prophets, saints, and angels, and ladies
All you gentlemen

Everybody walkin' this land
