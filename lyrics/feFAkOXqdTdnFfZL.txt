I need something I can dance to
On and on
Spin my world like a record now
On and on
Give me something I can dance to
Something I can count on
On and on
Spin my world like a record new
On and on
I need something I can dance to

And every night I pray
You'd let me
Can you hear me now DJ
You're gone tomorrow but
Just let the music play
Just let me
Just let the music play
Let the music play

I could be dancing
I could be dancing all night
If you would play
I could be dancing
I could be doing all right
If you would play

I need something I can turn to
Now and then
Take me out
Out-and-out
On and on
I need something I can turn to
Something I can count in
Day and night
On and on
Like a record now
Out and out
I need something I can dance to

If you would play
DJ
If you would play
DJ

Just let the music play
Let the music play
Just let the music play
All night
All right
Just let the music play
Let the music play
All night
Let the music play
All night
Just let the music play
Let the music play
All right
Just let the music play
DJ
