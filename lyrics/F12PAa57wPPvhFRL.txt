I can't wait to get back home to you
Talk about the things that we've been through
There is nothing I would rather do
Something's gotta happen pretty soon

And it's some other song

I don't know exactly what you do
You are all I ever thought I knew
I can live without this feeling blue
I can live without it, how about you?

And it's some other song
Yeah it's some other song

I don't know how to never fall apart
Please tell me how to never fall apart
No matter how you ever fall
And it's some other song

I don't know how to never fall apart
Still wondering how to never fall apart
No matter how you ever fall
And it's some other song
Yeah it's some other song
