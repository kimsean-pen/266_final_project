I used to pride myself on being the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want u with no other man
Why can't u understand anything I'm offering
I gave you the world but you just wanted arguing
From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped u off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again
"it's all his fault again" that's what u telling all ya friends
I aint pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again
See how ya day going I know they stressin on ya
I know them times get hard that's why I'm checkin on ya
It's yours truly ma, I got a little message for ya
Anything he can do, girl I can do it better for ya, cause

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me
Come on ova to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya mind girl
We gon do it our way

I heard your friend told a friend that told a friend of mine
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time
If this aint the truth then hopefully it's not a lie
Cause I aint got no issue's with hitting at another time
We never had a problem gettin it done
Disagreed upon a lot ma but the sex wasn't one
Now check it I know u get excited (still) when I come round and bite it (girl)
Quit frowin up and quit actin like you don't like

I like it, I like it, I really, really like it, I want it, adore it, so come let me enjoy it

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me
Come on ova to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya mind girl
We gon do it our way

Shawty where u been
Feels like a long time, long, long time since I seen ya
Yes it has girl, when I know I said some fucked up things to u before
But girl u know I didn't mean it
(I didn't mean one single word)
(I never meant one single word)
If I could take back every word I would and more fo sho
If I thought that you believe it
Cause you make my life so convenient for me

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me
Come on ova to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya mind girl
We gon do it our way
