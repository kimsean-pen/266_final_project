Come again, run again, you will never get past me!
Come and get it, run and get it, I will never be deceived.

You can run faster, you can catch that car,
But you will find it hard, 'cause you live too far.

You will always find it, you'll always get by,
There's always been a reason for your alibi,
The pain's not a problem, the problem's not a pain,
The pain is the pride that you keep inside.

Complicated, agitated go go by the life he leads,
Complicated, aggravated he will be the last to leave.

You can run faster, you can catch that car,
But you will find it hard, 'cause you live too far.

You will always find it, you'll always get by,
There's always been a reason for your alibi,
The pain's not a problem, the problem's not a pain,

The pain is the pride that you keep inside.

It's just youth, not a sick mind,
It's just youth, not a sick mind that I see...
It's just youth, not a sick mind,
It's just youth, not a sick mind that I see...

You will always find it, you'll always get by,
There's always been a reason for your alibi,
The pain's not a problem, the problem's not a pain,
The pain is the pride that you keep inside.

You will always find it, you'll always get by,
There's always been a reason for your alibi,
The pain's not a problem, the problem's not a pain,
The pain is the pride that you keep inside.
