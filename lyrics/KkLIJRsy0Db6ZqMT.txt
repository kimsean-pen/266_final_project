My promise could be your theme
A given end to your dreams
A simple movement or rhyme
Could be the smallest of signs
We'll never know what they are or care
And that's the statement or view
There's no escape - so few in fear
Day made a change in value

To be given your sight
Hid in a warm peaceful night
A nervous cry for your eyes
A fractured smile that soon dies
A language drawn from your life and soul
A sign which might have begun
A long farewell to your love and so
A long farewell to your soul

Now I know what those meant to do
No looking back now or pushing through
We'll change these feelings in taste or scene
But never gets loud or he would scream
But never gets loud or he would scream
But never gets loud or he would scream
