"And in a funny way, the shaving of my, uh, head has been a
liberation from, uh, a lot of, uh, stupid vanities really. Uh,
it has simplified everything for me, it has opened a lot of
doors maybe."
[SM]

I'm not what you think I am
I'm the king of Siam
I've got a bald head
My name is Yul Brynner
And I am a famous movie star
Perhaps you saw me in Westworld
I acted like a robotic cowboy
It was my best role
I can not deny I
Felt right home deep inside
That electronic carcass

You're such monumental slime
Let the punishment fit the crime
Tie it to a chair
The house music will blare
And turn your ears into
A medicinal jelly
Stay inside on Christmas Day
And make believe that you are my candy cane
You said, "I'm not that type,
No I'm not sweet, and I'm not overripe

Bob Dylan sang in
"Its alright mama im only bleeding",
Everything from toy guns that spark to flesh colored Christs
that glow in the dark
Its easy to see we got in too far and not much is really sacred.
