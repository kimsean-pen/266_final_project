Why be so?? already know
Oh, my love
You're soft
I know these roads like?? from my home
But I never settle down
Except my word is yours

You'll see, you'll see
I'm just NO GOOD FOR ME
You'll see, yeah, you'll see
I'm just NO GOOD FOR ME

Good for me, good for me
Good for me, good

Take what you can from the back of your hand
In all words I've seen
Change your meal and your tune
And despite what you say, every dog was its day
Every night marches home
Are you happy being alone?

You'll see, you'll see
I'm just NO GOOD FOR ME
You'll see, yeah, you'll see
I'm just NO GOOD FOR ME

You'll see, you'll see
I'm just NO GOOD FOR ME

Good for me, good for me
Good for me, good
