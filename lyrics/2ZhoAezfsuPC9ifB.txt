Losing patience
You're so complacent running around in circles
And I think I'm going numb
You're isolation, my head is aching
Ringing in my ears is all I'm hearing when you talk
What did you say?
"How was your day?"
Is it just something you say?
Cause I think you only care if it goes your way
You dug your grave, so don't blame me
This is the end, farewell, farewell, fair weather friend
Good to hear from you again
Address the nation. Communication
I hear you preaching all these words you can't erase
You think you're scripting words of wisdom
You climb the ladder just to fall back on your face
What did you say?
"How was your day?"
Is it just something you say?
Cause I think you only care if it goes your way
You dug your grave, so don't blame me
This is the end, farewell, farewell, fair weather friend
Good to hear from you again
I've been wasted
Spent a lifetime letting you get the best of me
There's no meaning in your message
There's no need to set me free
"How was your day?"
Is it just something you say?
Cause I think you only care if it goes your way
You dug your grave, so don't blame me
This is the end, farewell, farewell, fair weather friend
Good to hear from you again
