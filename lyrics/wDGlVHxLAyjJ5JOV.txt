Well you're just across the street
Looks a mile to my feet
I wanna go to you
Funny, how I'm nervous still
I've always been the easy kill
I guess I always will

Could it be that everything goes 'round by chance?
(Chance, chance)
Or only one way that it was always meant to be?
(Be)
You kill me you always know the perfect thing to say
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I know what I should do
But I just cannot walk away

I can picture your face well
From the bar in my hotel
I wish I'd go leave you
I pick up, put down the phone
Like your favorite heatmieser song goes
It's just like being alone

Oh God, please don't tell me this has been in vain
(Vain, vain)
I need answers for what all the waiting I've done means
(Means)
You kill me you've got some nerve
But can't face your mistakes
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I know what I should do
But I just cannot turn away, away, away

So go on Love
Leave while there's still hope for escape
Gotta take what you can these days
There's so much ahead
So much regret
I know what you wanna say
(I know what you wanna say)
I know it, but can't help feeling differently
I loved you and I should've said it
But tell me, just what has it ever meant?

I can't help it baby, this is who I am
(Am, am)
I'm sorry but I can't just go turn off how I feel
(Feel)
You kill me, you build me up
But just to watch me break
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I know what I should do
But I just can't walk away
