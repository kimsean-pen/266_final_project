Lonely shadows following me
Lonely ghosts come calling
Lonely voices talking to me
Now I'm gone, now I'm gone, now I'm gone
And my mother told me son let it be
Sold my soul to the calling
Sold my soul to a sweet melody
Now I'm gone, now I'm gone, now I'm gone

Oh give me that fire
Oh give me that fire
Oh give me that fire
Burn, burn, burn

Oh, a thousand faces staring at me
Thousand times I've fallen
Thousand voices dead at my feet
Now I'm gone, now I'm gone, now I'm gone
And my mother told me son let it be
Sold my soul to the calling
Sold my soul to a sweet melody
Now I'm gone, now I'm gone, now I'm gone

Oh give me that fire
Oh give me that fire
Oh give me that fire
Burn, burn, burn

Ghosts and devils come calling
Calling my name out, lost in the fire
Sweet virgin your blood is calling
Calling my name out, lost in the fire

Oh give me that fire
Oh give me that fire
Oh give me that fire
Burn, burn, burn
Oh give me that fire
Oh give me that fire
Oh give me that fire
Burn, burn, burn
