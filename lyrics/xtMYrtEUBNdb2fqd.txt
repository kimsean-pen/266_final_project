You got my heart beating
Beating, beating, beating, beating, beating

You got my mind to follow
Follow, follow, follow, follow

Over
Fall over

I gave up
My, my pride, why?
Why? Lay over
My motion says why

You got my heart beating
Beating, beating, beating, beating, beating

Fall over
Fall over

I gave up
My pride. Why?
I let you burn
My shelter. Why?
I let you burn
My shelter. Why?
