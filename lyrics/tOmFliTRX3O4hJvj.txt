In a world of mammon we have found it all!
Fighting for pride and for gold
But the key to the reign to the ultimate control
Wisdom of the old

We have been elect to drain the wine
Of Gnosis to hide it and pray
Got to save our children from the beast
We are on the way

Remaining in darkness
The land of salvation will drown
And when we'll have vanished
Slavery will take your freedom down

Seven eyes to be blind forever in time
Sign of the cross
Hell arise! Castigation under the sign
Sign of the cross, make us drown in altar wine

In the heart of justice called Horeb long ago
Moses got carvings in stone
Imposed to judge those who do not fear
The only, the holy, the lord

The blood of anger and pain
Ink of the Old Testament
I know they'll end their crusade
Drown in the blood of the lamb

Remaining in darkness
The land of salvation will drown
And when we'll have vanished
Slavery will take your freedom down

Seven eyes to be blind forever in time
Sign of the cross
Hell arise! Castigation under the sign
Sign of the cross, make us drown in altar wine

You have been the chosen one
So welcome to this place
Vandroiy's told us you would come to help us win the race
Bring back the seal from the men who don't know what they do
Seemed to be a fool without and own way of life
But you've been a sleeping mind and you woke up on time
You've got the power to save us and finally you

A dream is forever
The land of salvation can't drown
These enchanting colors
Who could have the might to tear it down?

Seven eyes to be blind forever in time
Sign of the cross
Hell arise! Castigation under the sign
Sign of the cross

Seven eyes, follow the sign
Sign of the cross
Seven eyes, follow the sign
Sign of the cross
