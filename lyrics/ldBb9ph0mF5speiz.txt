Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green girl?
I know you're sick and tired of arguing,
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we gotta swallow it.
Your heart and mind, Baby, follow it
Smile, happiness, you can model it
and when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
I'm 'a do the best I can do
'Cuz I'm the best when I'm with you.

Come close to me, Baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world gets crazy
What's it without you? (nothing nothing)

You helped me to discover me
I just want you to put trust in me
I kinda laugh when you cuss at me
The aftermath is you touching me
It's destiny that we connected girl
You and I, we can affect the world
I'm tired of the fast lane
I want you to have my last name

Come close to me, Baby (Come close to me, Baby)
Let your love home you (Let me move you tonight, Baby)
I know this world gets crazy
What's it without you? (we gonna make it)
I love you, I love you, I love you

I know what you're thinking: You're on my mind
you're right, you're right, you're right
You promise too fast. It just might take time
I hope you're not tired tonight, tonight
