Where'd you go?
I thought we'd last forever
Where'd I go?
I was sinking through the leather

I need you back

Please don't run away

Please don't run away
Please don't run away
(Please don't run away)

I don't know why
I don't know why I feel this way

I don't know why
I don't know why I feel the same

I need you back
I need you bad
I need you back (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Where'd you go?
I thought we'd last forever (last forever)
Where'd I go?
I was sinking through the leather
