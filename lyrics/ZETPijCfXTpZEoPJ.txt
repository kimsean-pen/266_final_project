Pure evil is running through my veins
It's always been a part of me I can never explain
I made people fall in love with the way that I made them feel
I found the cracks in their broken souls before they could heal

And it was pure evil
(Running through my veins)
And it was pure evil
(Killing me again)

I hurt you in a way I can never forgive myself for
I left you on a tray and pretended that you never existed, oh
I know that I confused all the feelings I had
For more than just a way of trying to bury the past
And I'm sorry it was you that I fooled
Now I'm lying in a hotel room
I'm lying in a hotel room

I found a way to become whoever you needed in that one
Moment of vulnerability
It's gone but you're still in me

And it was pure evil
(Running through my veins, killing me again)

I hurt you in a way I can never forgive myself for
I might have taken all the chances you will have to carry a name on
I've been holding it together, trying to bury the pain
But underneath the surface I'm a mess, I'm a stain
And I'm sorry that it had to be you
Now you're lying in a hotel room
Yeah you're lying in a hotel room
