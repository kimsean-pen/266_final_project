Feeling nowhere the more I sense you
If you were mine I'd get all my love here
Forming layers the road I sent you on
Already know your way, I don't know one

I own all of you
You're saying I borrowed it
You're kicking me off of mine in a cloud of pain

If you were laying the way I found you
If you could see in your own red eyes, fear
For the way I had almost led you on
Already know your way, I don't know one

I own all of you
You're saying I borrowed it
You're kicking me off of mine in a cloud of pain

The more I led you on

It's the first and the last of my own
And the world that I need is young
And now all that I ask is one
Of the roads that will lead to my love
