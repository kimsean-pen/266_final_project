It has a certain ring: "Love's a funny thing"

You're always watching me everywhere, I know
Moving on is hard when you don't wanna let go
Like the homesick Caribou must return to the snow
I'll find you in another life, I hope
And though I'm not religious
I've been shaking hands with Jesus

When I am finally dead, maybe I'll come back as someone else
And after all this pain, I can love you in the end
"You're someone I'll find", it wasn't a lie
And after all this time, your love has ruined my life
Your love has ruined my life

The world is brimming with life, and I'm so alone
My heart is bursting with love, and where does it go?

When I am finally dead, maybe I'll come back as someone else
And after all this pain, I can love you in the end
"You're someone I'll find", it wasn't a lie
And after all this time, your love has ruined my life

How can I live my life deprived of your love, of your love?

Will I ever heal? I just don't know
But without you, the open world feels so closed
Will I ever heal? I just don't know
But without you, the open world feels so closed

When I am finally dead, maybe I'll come back as someone else
And after all this pain, I can love you in the end
"You're someone I'll find", it wasn't a lie
After all this time, your love has ruined my life

Will I ever heal? I just don't know
But without you, the open world feels so closed
Will I ever heal? I just don't know
But without you, the open world feels so closed
Your love has ruined my life
