I'm so, I'm so sick
Of shutting down when you come to me
I'm cut so clear

I know, I know it
You are for nothing
When I run to you
You walk on me

I used to think we had purpose
Like a house without a roof, or a car without wheels
I think I'm so good at problems
You're dripping through, I pass you'll split

Nobody hurts me, and fuck you for trying
You got me all wrong, what were you thinking?
Doing the same thing, you promise you're changing
You got this all wrong, what were you thinking?

You know, you know that
I'm just as broken as I've always been
You exploit me

Can you take care of your weakness?
It's showing through, I'm not that thick
I used to think you had substance
But you have no truth, you're insincere

Nobody hurts me, and fuck you for trying
You got me all wrong, what were you thinking?
Doing the same thing, you promise you're changing
You got this all wrong, what were you thinking?

Look where we end up
No way out, I am stuck
Have you got me where you want?
No way out, I am stuck

Nobody hurts me, and fuck you for trying
You got this all wrong, what were you thinking?
Doing the same thing, you promise you're changing
You got me all wrong, what were you thinking?
