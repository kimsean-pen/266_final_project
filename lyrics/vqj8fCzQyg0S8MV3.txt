Flames, in my heart
It puts fire in my mind
And it's cold when you're gone
And it leaves me behind
Please don't believe what they say
The lies
Just put your trust in the ones
You're alive
Wasting all your time
Wasting all your time
Wasting all your time
Wasting all your time
It's suicidal hurt
The way we walk around
Dark creatures of the night
And we'll take you under the rug
So just stay far from the flames
And thank God every day
It's suicidal hurt
The way you walk around
Flames, in my heart
It puts fire in my eyes
It ignites in a blaze
And it sends to the sky
All these distractions that leave me blind
Watch as they gently trip out of my mind
Wasting all your time
Wasting all your time
Wasting all your time
Wasting all your time
It's suicidal hurt
The way we walk around
Dark creatures of the night
And we'll take you under the rug
So just stay far from the flames
And thank God every day
It's suicidal hurt
The way you walk around
The way you walk around
The way you walk around
The way you walk around
