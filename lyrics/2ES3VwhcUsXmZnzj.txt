You're under the water
Trying to pull me under
I reach for you
I reach for you

You can throw it all at me, I won't give you up
I can handle all your pain, take it as it comes
I love you right, but you make me feel like

Paper, you cut right through
I'm stuck like glue to you
Paper, your darkness pulls
I lose control again

Drawing every bit of my truth
Colour me in with your blue
Paper, you cut right through
A thousand words for you

I know I wasn't a part of you plan
I know you think that you're being a man
Tell me to leave you alone
Tell me I would be so better off
But you don't understand

I can't leave you, baby
I can't leave you
But you make me feel like

Paper, you cut right through
I'm stuck like glue to you
Paper, your darkness pulls
I lose control again

Drawing every bit of my truth
Colour me in with your blue
Paper, you cut right through
A thousand words for you

Paper, you cut right through
I'm stuck like glue to you
Paper, your darkness pulls
I lose control again

Drawing every bit of my truth
Colour me in with your blue
Paper, you cut right through
A thousand words for you
