You say that Gainesville's got no soul.
Well that sounds like a good excuse for coming home.
And all these Tallahassee skylines, they keep singing out a song.
And know it's your song they've been singing all night long.
And this Galley Alley rooftop just keeps calling out your name to come and stay.
So stay.

So stay.
Stay and watch the stars come out and then the sun as they all fade away.
I'll sing every song I know if it will make you want to stay, and then I'll say
That I missed you.
And these words.
They'll convince you, to stay.

I poured through every song I wrote.
Every line that I've cried every note That was spilt with this pen.
And every line in every song, they all seemed to come out wrong until your song.
So let's sing it all night long.
And this Tallahassee skyline hasn't changed
While the view from every rooftop says to stay.
Stay and watch the stars come out and then the sun as they all fade away.

I'll sing every song I know if it will make you want to stay, and then I'll say
That I missed you.
And these words.
They'll convince you, to stay.
And I could call you baby doll all the time.

And you'd whisper in my ears.
You'd say "I missed you boy."
Now sing it over again, and over again, and over again.
And I could call you baby doll all the time.

And you'd whisper in my ears.
You'd say "I missed you boy."
Now sing it over again, and over again, and over again.
And I could call you baby doll all the time.

And you'd whisper in my ears.
You'd say "I missed you boy."
Now sing it over again, and over again, and over again.
Still you'd say that I missed you

and these words they'll convince you
And I'm happy as I kiss you...
And I could call you baby doll all the time.
And you'd whisper in my ears.
You'd say "I missed you boy."
Now sing it over again, and over again, and over again.
And I could call you baby doll all the time.
And you'd whisper in my ears.
You'd say "I missed you boy."
Now sing it over again, and over again, and over again.
