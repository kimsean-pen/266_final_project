Love is not a toy
Fragile girls and boys
Gather beating hearts
Shattered work of art

I was afraid of the love that you asked for
You asked for
You were the light in my eyes
You're the answer
The answer

The fire in you is long gone
It burned too bright, like the red sun
The child in me is elsewhere
(Elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere)
On the dance floor

Love is not a choice
(All of the kids on the dance floor)
Wasted girls and boys
(Let out your freak on the dance floor)

I was afraid of the love that you asked for
You asked for
You were the light in my eyes
You're the answer
The answer

The fire in you is long gone
It burned too bright, like the red sun
The child in me is elsewhere
(Elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere)
On the dance floor

Elsewhere (elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere)
On the dance floor, ah
(Elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere)
On the dance floor, mmm

I was afraid of the love that you asked for
You asked for
You were the light in my eyes
You're the answer
The answer

The fire in you is long gone
It burned too bright, like the red sun
The child in me is elsewhere
(Elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere)
On the dance floor

The child in me is elsewhere, on the dance floor
The child in me is elsewhere, on the dance floor
