Lost at sea
Father, come take me back home
The sun's colder today
But the rhythm of water is keeping me warm

Feel its weight, lay your head down
Oh burden, how did we come so far?
Stay with me, until fear no longer defines us

Under these waves
My lungs, filled with hope
Misconceptions and the need to control
Leave it all behind to live once more

Reaching for the surface
Wonder what it would feel like to break away with the tide
Reaching for the surface to rise above the past

Drifting in air, above the droning sounds
Where my roots can not trespass my weary soul
Striving towards a new day
I am more than they will ever know

Reaching for the surface
Wonder what it would feel like to break away with the tide
Reaching for the surface to rise above the past
