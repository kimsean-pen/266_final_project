Listen
Now you will see
All you destroyed
Nothing survived
And the pain of existence is all that remains

When can i see the world with youth in my eyes again?
Am i wishing for days passed that will never come?

So lie to me,
And tell me that i'll be okay
Tell me that i will be okay
That this pain of existing
Sheds away
Please, tell me this pain
Sheds away

So whisper the comforts that eaze the pain
I walk next to shadows that will never leave
And i let this gasoline baptize our home
Striking the match
Anointed by none

Let's burn down this house,
Set it aflame
For this place was broken
Long before you came

Now you will see
As i depart
