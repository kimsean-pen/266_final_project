Through days are slow far from town
Come along and settle down
The way you're dancing gown
In springtime of the year
Youre loving will not go in vain
My holdings and my land to again
If we were just to take my name
In the springtime of the year
Oh how happy you could be here
In the Springtime of the year
The sun will burn up all the snows
And pull the barley up in rows
And where it comes from, heaven knows
In springtime of the year
Alas, the summer is over
No more yellow clover
We will soon know brown october
Till the springtime of the year
How happy you could be here in
In the springtime of the year
Ohh sleet of snow will keep you here
Till the springtime of the year
