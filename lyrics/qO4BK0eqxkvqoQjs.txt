look what you've done to your arms
i see you don't care who you harm
i understand
you've never been the girl next door
but now you're worse than before
self destruct
self... destruct

life's miseries pain is deep
does it matter what anybody cares?
can there be another outlet?
nobody gets close, nobody dares
self destruct
self... destruct

i understand your problems
i can figure out the reasons why
but i can't help what i feel
i can't accept what i see
self destruct
self... destruct

there's got to be a way to get out
