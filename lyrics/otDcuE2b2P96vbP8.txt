God knows it's?
And I'm not certain if?
How close I was
What brought you here?
Maybe I can't decide
But all I ever want from you it's likely to make you sad
I never meant like that

And while I know that these dreams that we carry on
Might not come soon
I really hope they do

And while I know that these dreams that we carry on
Might not come soon
What else we? to do?

I change my mind from time to time
I can't help it understand
It's out of my hands

Maybe I should have known this
Maybe I dont even want to believe you
But I forget
I never meant like that

And while I know that these dreams that we carry on
Might not come soon
I really hope they do

And while I know that these dreams that we carry on
Might not come soon
What else we? to do?
