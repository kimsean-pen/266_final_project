I don't wanna be your secret
cause by the time I'm here
you're leaving
you never wanna take the chance
you got two left feet
but you still know how to dance
yeah
I don't mean to rush you baby
indecisiveness got me feeling crazy
and I don't want any bad karma
but when you gonna tell your mama
that you met a boy you don't care what she tells your father
why would you bother
to cover up your tracks
never call me back
back to where we started
oohh
cause you don't wanna stay the night
you don't know you wrong from right
(wrong from right)
sweet like honey lavender
keep on running back to her
(back to her)
I don't wanna be your backup
you had me when you had enough
I guess I got to roll the dice
you say pretty little things
but you dont play nice yeah
I don't mean to rush you baby
indecisiveness got me feeling crazy
and I don't want any bad karma
but when you gonna tell your mama
that you met a boy you don't care what she tells your father
why would you bother
to cover up your tracks
never call me back
back to where we started
oohh
cause you don't wanna stay the night
you don't know you wrong from right
(wrong from right)
sweet like honey lavender
keep on running back to her

Patience like petrol, it's running low
I'm still gonna try and give you space
And I don't know what else to say now
Cause you don't wanna stay the night
You don't know your wrong from right wrong from right, yeah
Sweet like honey lavender
