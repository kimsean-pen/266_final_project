You found me here, waiting for your chance
You would reach inside and take all of me
You watch your lies smother me again
But now you can't!

Don't even try your wasting time
Jump back I'll beat you down and turn around
I'm fighting my way through you
Push you away, I'll never break
Come back ill beat you down
It's over now
I'm turning my back on you

I turn around, there you are
A blink and a flash back to you again
You push me down tried to steal it all
This time I pushing back!

Don't even try your wasting time
Jump back I'll beat you down, turn around
I'm fighting my way through you
Push you away, I'll never break
Come back I'll beat you down
It's over now
I'm turning my back on you

Ohh on you

Go ahead and try to stop me
Go ahead and try to stop me
Go ahead and try to stop me
Go ahead and try!
Go ahead and try!

Don't even try, you're wasting time
Jump back I'll beat you down and turn around
I'm fighting my way through you!
Push you away, I'll never break
Come back I'll beat you down
It's over now
I'm turning my back on you!
