i would run away from you
if i could
never really wanted to
but i guess i should run
i would fall in love with you
but i can't
it's too hard
maybe we'll just pretend
but it's hard when i don't know what to do
i'm angry and i'm tired and confused
i got so many thoughts stuck in my head
and none of them
make much sense
i said i would follow you
but i lied
don't be mad
well at least i tried
i never had a spot for you
in my life
which was true
til i heard you cry
and your tears dripped down your face into my eyes
i'm sorry and i hate myself this time
cause i got so many thoughts stuck in my head
and none of them
make much sense
instrumental
oooooo oooooo
