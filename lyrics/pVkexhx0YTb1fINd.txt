All the girls I've known are crying
Ooh ooh
All the clouds have silver linings
Ooh ooh
Though the days are counting backwards
Ooh ooh
I know that you will have the right words
Ooh ooh

Me and you
Have something to do
Could this be true
It all comes back to you

Ooooh...

Hey you
When I hold you in my arms
You'll be finding what you're searching for
Hey you
Put your lips to the ground,
Feel the love into your arms I fall

Oooh

All the girls I've known are crying
Ooh ooh
All the clouds have silver linings
Ooh ooh

Me and you
Have something to do
Could this be true
It all comes back to you

Ooooh...

Hey you
When I hold you in my arms
You'll be finding what you're searching for
Hey you
Put your lips to the ground
Feel the love into your arms I fall
Hey you

When I hold you in my arms
You'll be finding what you're searching for
Hey you
Put your lips to the ground
Feel the love into your arms I fall
