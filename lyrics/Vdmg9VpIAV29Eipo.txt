Falling like you ever did fall
Sleeping like it's never, never enough
Calling back the man who looked so sure
He seemed like he knew what he was for
Performing like you ever did perform
The same old speech I heard all before
Falling like you ever did fall
We both know these waves never reach the shore
These waves never reach the shore
Falling like you ever did fall
Sleeping like it's never, never enough
Falling like you ever did fall
Sleeping like it's never, never enough
Never enough
Never enough
Never enough
Falling like you ever did fall
Sleeping like it's never, never enough
Falling like you ever did fall
Sleeping like it's never, never enough
Never enough
Never enough
Never enough
