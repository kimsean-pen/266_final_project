Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
Mmm

Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise, oh
For what you're trying to do

Livin' on your cheatin'
And the pain grows inside me
It's enough to leave me cryin' in the rain
Love you forever but you're drivin' me insane
And I'm hangin' on, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'll win, I'll never give in
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Ain't good for you

You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right

I ain't no vision, I'm the girl
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards
With my heart hangin' out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire?

Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in my lifetime
Ain't good for me

You figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Let this moment be forever
We won't ever feel the storm

I ain't no vision, I'm the girl
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards
With my heart hangin' out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire?

Don't try to tell me that it's over
I can't hear a word, I can't hear a line
No girl could love you more
And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside

You are the reason
All my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle
I will burn again tomorrow

No man on earth can stand
Between my lovin' arms
And no matter how you hurt me
I will love you till I die

I ain't no vision, I'm the girl
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards
With my heart hangin' out
I love no other way
What are we gonna do if we lose that fire?

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards
With my heart hangin' out
I love no other way

What are we gonna do if we lose that fire?
Inside and out
Inside and out
Inside and out

Inside and out
Inside and out
Inside and out
