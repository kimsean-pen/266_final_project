Time heals, time goes on and time really flies
Time hurts and time can cut you, cut you down to size
There's no need to touch you now, no, I'm doing fine
Life too can cut you and I've cut you out of mine

You're making me sorry
Sorry somehow
You're making me sorry
Sorry somehow

There's no need to talk to you, well, to know what's on your mind
There's no need to see you either, no, I'm just being kind
You want me to beg forgiveness, tender an apology
It's not my fault and you're not getting one from me

You're making me sorry
Sorry somehow
You're making me sorry
Sorry somehow

Now I guess it's your decision, now you decide
Take me to the cleaners baby, take me for a ride
Whoever cares for your affairs will sort it out for you
Send me a subpoena, baby, tell me what to do

You're making me sorry
Sorry somehow
You're making me sorry
Sorry somehow

I don't have to think about you, think about the past
Those days stand out in my mind and those days were the last
I know the time is coming and I'm waiting for the day
I'd give you everything in the world just to get it out of the way

You're making me sorry
Sorry somehow
You're making me sorry
Sorry somehow
