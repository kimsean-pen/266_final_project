Mouth open
For rain pinching
Your nose pinching
To wake yourself from hell
But your knees
Glued to the floor
Anchored in fear
Roots in the wolves that spilt their
Life into you
Nativity of the botched pact boon
Screaming at your shoes
Cemented and accused
But they don't want you to know that
Bravery won't drown
So you keep the water running

Mouth open
For days
Waiting for rain
Screaming to wake yourself from hell
But the sleep
So deep that it's real
Your punches so weak
They miss when they land
And so you give
Until all that's left
Are desperate cries
That fall on the deaf
But if you feel love-
The hot molten trust
Rise up and wipe
That sleep from your eyes
And

Hold back your tears
Wax the pain
Pressure on the wound
If you fall
Caught like trout see that
Bravery won't drown
So you keep the water running
And hold back the blood
Flowing through your nose
Pressure on the wound
If you fall
Caught like trout see that
Bravery won't drown
So you keep the water running
Bravery won't drown
So you keep the water running
