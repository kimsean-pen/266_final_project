I can't live for you
But you know I wish I could
Part of me died for you
And I think it's gone for good
I can't stay around, I can't stay around
But I wish I could
I can't live for you
I can't live
I tried
You can't deny that
I tried
We'll talk when we're older
And when we been sober
Pretend like we're not strangers
And start over then
Swear the time between us is
All I really need, but
That won't make this easier
In the end
We can go around and around again
'Round and around again
We can go around and around again
But it's all in my head
It's easier to hate me
Tell yourself you got nothing to miss
Say that you forgave me
Why can't you remember me like you did
Before we fell apart
Acknowledge all the flaws
Had 'em from the start
I can't live for you, no
I tried
You can't deny that
I tried
We'll talk when we're older
And when we've been sober
Pretend that we're not strangers
And start over then
Swear the time between us is
All we really need, but
That won't make this easier
In the end
We can go around and around again
'Round and around again
We can go around and around again
But it's all in my head
We can go around and around again
'Round and around again
We can go around and around again
But it's all in my head
We'll talk when we're older
And when we've been sober
Pretend like we're not strangers
Hey
Swear the time between us is
All we really need, but
That won't make this easy
We can go around and around again
'Round and around again
We can go around and around again
But it's all in my head
We can go around and around again
'Round and around again
We can go around and around again
But it's all in my head
