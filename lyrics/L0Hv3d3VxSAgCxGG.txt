I'm not quite myself these days
Guess we all come undone
time to time in different ways well
I have myself to blame.

Guess I don't understand, I need help in many ways.
God's got a plan for me
Well I'm gonna tell you one thing:
I don't got the patience, or the time!

What can I say?
I'm no angel
I'm not forsaken
But I can bleed!

Tear me open I believe
God will set you up to bleed!
And no one can decieve

what it's meant to be and
Bloody Murder we will scream!

Well I guess it's time for me
Tell me what I'm left to believe in?
Cause I don't know the concept
Of the pain

I don't want the fate
I'll just lose it
I can prove it
Watch me bleed!

Tear me open I believe
God will set you up to bleed!
And no one can decieve

what it's meant to be and
Bloody Murder we will scream!
God will set you up to tear me open!
Cause I'm
Not Giving Up
No self control!
Suffocated to the bone
I'm my Worst Enemy
Who can't be saved
I'm Just his disgrace
Tear me open I believe
God will set you up to bleed!
And no one can decieve
what it's meant to be a
Bloody Murder we will scream!
God will sent you up to tear me open!
These days are strange it's true.
There's not a thing that I would change
no mistakes that I'd undo.
