This could be my last confession
This could be my last defense
I wish that we could learn our lesson
I wish that we could make amends and turn the page

As far as I remember
It was a day to forgive and forget
You said that you would let go
But I guess you didn't mean what you said
There was time I would surrender
'Cause you don't wanna live with regret
Nothing lasts forever
As far as I remember

This could be a new beginning
Or this could be a brutal end
I wish that we could stop pretending
I wish that we could make amends and turn the page

As far as I remember
It was a day to forgive and forget
You said that you would let go
But I guess you didn't mean what you said
There was time I would surrender
'Cause you don't wanna live with regret
And nothing lasts forever
As far as I remember

I'd rather die on my feet than live my life on my knees
I'd rather die on my feet than live my life on my knees
I'd rather die on my feet than live my life on my knees
As far as I remember
It was a day to forgive and forget
You said that you would let go

But I guess you didn't mean what you said
There was time I would surrender
'Cause you don't wanna live with regret
Nothing lasts forever
As far as I remember
I'd rather die on my feet than live my life on my knees
I'd rather die on my feet than live my life on my knees (as far as I remember)
I'd rather die on my feet than live my life on my knees (as far as I remember)
I'd rather die on my feet than live my life on my knees
