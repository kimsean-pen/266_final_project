We will light ourselves a flame
Light ourselves a flame as we kiss the sky

We set the fires to take us higher
We set the fires to watch them burn
Burn
Burn
Burn Burn Burn
Let's burn this bastard to the ground

You're my deep obsession
I'm the sweet depression
I'm your muse

Make it burn

We are the voices that ignite the masses
Scream for me, we are free

Strength in numbers, we encumber your dominion
Rightfully, I wanna hear you scream
Mercy please

I won't stop
Dead, or not
We are the voices that ignite the fucking truth

We set the fires to take us higher
We set the fires to watch them burn
Burn!
Burn!
Burn Burn Burn
Let's Burn this bastard to the ground
We set the fires to take us even higher
We set the fires to watch them fucking burn
Burn!
Burn!
Burn Burn Burn
Let's burn this bastard to the ground

Burn it to the ground
Cleansing all the hate of the wicked
Liberate our life from oppression

Come on
Make it burn
We set the fires to take us higher
we set the fires to watch them burn

Burn!
Burn!
Burn Burn Burn
Burn this bastard to the ground
We set the fires to take us even higher
we set the fires to watch them fucking burn
Burn!
Burn!
Burn Burn Burn
Let's burn this bastard to the ground
We will light ourselves a flame
Light ourselves a flame, as we kiss the sky
