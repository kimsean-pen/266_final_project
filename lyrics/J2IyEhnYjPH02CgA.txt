Hey, let's cross the sea
And get some culture
Red wine with every meal
And absinthe after dinner

We'd look good
Side by side
Walking back
To the hotel

We've got to get something
To eat and to drink, yeah
And find a place to stay
That's not far off the main way

We've got to plan our day
Rodin' and the Orsay
And find a way to cram it all in
Before we drink hard again

Let's get a bottle
And drink, alone tonight
Let's get a bottle
And drink, alone tonight

This light looks good on you
Morning came early
Sitting on a park bench
That's older than my country

Two star hotel
Near St.Germaine
Two star hotel
Where the stars don't mean
Where the stars don't mean anything

We've got to get something
To eat and to drink, yeah
And find a place to stay
That's not far off the main way
Let's get a bottle

We've got to get something
To eat and to drink, yeah
And find a place to stay
That's not far off the main way

We've got to plan our day

And find a way to cram it all in
Before we drink hard again

Let's get a bottle
And drink, alone tonight
Let's get a bottle
And drink, alone tonight

Let's get a bottle
And drink, alone tonight
Let's get a bottle
