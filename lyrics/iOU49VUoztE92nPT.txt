Light drops off around us
Tension makes a stand
For once the air's filled with promise
I'm lost in you
Hard breathing not like it's for nothing
An open door not meant for shutting
This is all I've ever wanted
I want it with you
Your driving North in the slow lane all alone
And I'm right here where you left me right here ready to go
