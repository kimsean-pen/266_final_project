You'd better run
You'd better run
You'd better run from the Devil's gun

The race is on
The race is on
So you better run from the Devil's gun

Strange things happen
If you stay
The Devil will catch you anyway
He'll try to find you
So take care

The Devil will seek you everywhere

And when he finds you
You'll soon find out
The Devil's fire it won't go out
He burns you up
And soon you'll know
The Devil's grip just won't let go
