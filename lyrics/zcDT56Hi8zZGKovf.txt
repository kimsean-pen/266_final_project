I've been to the end of earth,
And waters, end of sky.
I've circled the mountains,
the forests,
across the nights.
Over the land that I have seen,
where the wind swept my heart clean.

I've find the way to feel alive,
leaving behind your eagle eye.

Love like a dance in fire,
untainted, rising high.
The power to dwell as one,
unchained, will not die.
When you have burned,
so deep within,
rest the ashes, then begin.

I've find the way to feel alive,
leaving behind your eagle eye.

Over the land that we have seen,
where the winds went our hearts clean.
When we have burned,
deep within,
rest the ashes, then begin.

Eagle eye...

Over the land that we have seen,
ehere the winds went our hearts clean.
When we have burned,
so Deep within,
rest the ashes, then begin.

I've find the way to feel alive,
leaving behind your eagle eye.
