Hustle in the five old years
Do you love and do you feel
All your working inspiration
Systematic exploration
Words so great, words so real
Words so desperate and concealed
All your words are so poetic
Generational synthetic

And I will do it on my own again
I will say what I will
And I will do it on my own again
And I will say what I will

All my friends are far away
Hit my head in disobey
I can help but to forget
What is now and what is next
Train a fortune for a soul
What we wanted all along
All your words are so magnetic
Generational pathetic
