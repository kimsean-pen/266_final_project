It's been a long time
Since I last saw your face
I know you still want me

Can't seem to fight
The way that I feel
You're my greatest hit

We dance and groove in the disco lights
I want you alone with me tonight
Can I hold you, make you feel all right?
Really want to stay here all the night

Keep it comin' baby, can you dig it?
thought I had to look all over for it
it's not easy but I have to admit
come on baby you're my greatest hit

Keep it comin' baby, can you dig it?
thought I had to look all over for it (yeah)
it's not easy but I have to admit
come on baby you're my greatest hit

Boy you make me feel I'm your only star
When we're together darkness seems so far
Take my hand and show me who you are
On a moonlight drive in a red old car

Keep it comin' baby, can you dig it?
thought I had to look all over for it
it's not easy but I have to admit
come on baby you're my greatest hit

Keep it comin' baby, can you dig it?
thought I had to look all over for it
it's not easy but I have to admit
come on baby you're my greatest hit
