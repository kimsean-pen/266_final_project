In this dark room, in this bed
When you hold me like this,
You're so secure
Your body that you press
My body to is very warm
Right now I fear nothing
I couldn't feel safer
I couldn't feel safer

I always feel this way, that no harm can come to me
When I'm in your company
I always feel this way, that no harm can come to me
When I'm in your company

In this dark room, in this bed
When you hold me like this,
You're so secure
Your body that you press
My body to is very warm
Right now I fear nothing
I couldn't feel safer
I couldn't feel safer

I always feel this way, that no harm can come to me
When I'm in your company
I always feel this way, that no harm can come to me
When I'm in your company
