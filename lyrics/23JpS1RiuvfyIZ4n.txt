I pulled up the roots just to see
I've felt differently since about disappearing

I placed myself back in the weeds
In echoes in alleys I'm reminded
(As close to closure as we'll come
As close to composure as I've come)
I'd immersed myself in beauty
And find it all vanishing
Empty. Longing and vulnerable
Sharpen your knives
Neither a pawn nor a king
I am nowhereI am nothing
For this betrayal that's how I should be seen
Wearing scars I deserve
On a throne of nothing
Ethereal and haunting
The wandering and yearning
Characters I've kept
Plotless and neglecting
The architect and monument
Neither here nor there
Forever elsewhere
And so it goes
There's consequence to these vowels and consonants
And I came as close to heaven as I'll come
