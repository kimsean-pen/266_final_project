besides the abyss we love beauty
besides a mind we have a heart
besides warmth we love clarity
and when your tenderness departs
down in the chamber
i try so hard to see the sky
from here we can sink so deep
and then move up so very highdown in the chamber
do you think we have arrived
neben dem abgrund steht die schönheit
um deine augen der untergang
neben der kälte die ästhetik
denn unsere herzen stehen in flammen
down in the chamber
if we hallucinate we can see light
from here we can sink so deep
and then move up so very high
we could decay in this
from here we might as well begin to climb
down in the chamber
we walk a path of failures and of hights
