I'm alone and now i'm sorry
I'm at home and now it's scary
And it seems like somethings coming soon.
Day comes around and i won't wake up
Dismiss the sounds of ill-defined make up
It counts as loud but it just leaves me cold.
I was thinking disillusioned
And you were sinking into memory.
All i do is create an illusion
All i need is a little intrusion
Form a sound with an idea
Hope to drown before i see you
Cause i was drinking my conclusion
And i was finding my necessity.
