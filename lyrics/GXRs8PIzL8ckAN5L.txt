Contact is all that it takes
To change your life, to lose your place in time
Contact. Asleep or awake
Coming around you may wake up to find
Questions deep within your eyes
Now more than ever, you realize

And then you sense a change
Nothin' feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Simply pulls a string

Another world, some other time
You lay your sanity on the line
Familiar faces, familiar sights
Reach back, remember with all your might
Ooh, and there she stands in a silken gown
Silver lights shinin' down

And then you sense a change
Nothin' feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Simply pulls a string

Love comes walkin' in

(Guitar Solo)

Oh, sleep and dream; that's all I crave
I travel far across the milky way
To my master I become a slave
'Til we meet again some other day
Where silence speaks as loud as war
Earth returns to what it was before

And then you sense a change
Nothin' feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Simply pulls a string
Love comes walkin' in
(Guitar Solo)
Love comes walkin' in
Baby, pull the string
Love comes walkin' in
Love comes walkin' in, yeah!
Huh-uh! Ye-ah, oh-oh oh
