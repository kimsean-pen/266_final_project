(sample:)
A lemonade.

Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.

(Backing throughout the verses:) ba-ba-da ba-da ba-ba-ba-da...

Pass me the suitcase, baby.
I know it's not that easy and
give me my mirror, love,
just give me back my memories,
and oh, oh, how many years
is it now Maurice?

Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good.

And I was half-asleep, and
riding on a slow-coach, I
think I lose all these things still,
meaning I'm not holy and, oh,
oh, your honey-dish,
oh, it's on my list.

Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good.

Wish my heart's wish
climbing out your window
for your savage amusement.
You put a spell over me, well,
smells like lemon flavour.

ba-ba-da ba-da ba-ba-ba-da...

Tuesday, if I had you back again
you know I'm against the future.
Wednesday, I was a little girl
(I was the little girl who'd like to snog your face.)
and ooh,
oh, how many years is it now Maurice?

Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good.

Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
Oo-oo-ooh, young heart.
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good.
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good.
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good.
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good.
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good.
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good.
(And then I shall go back to Maurice.)
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good.
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good.
