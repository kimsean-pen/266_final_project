If it weren't for those (?) you're riding on
You would not exist
If it weren't for the flashlight shining in my face
Maybe I could resist

chorus
I think I'm hyper enough as it is
I think I'm hyper enough

When all our bones and muscles hurt
What's so funny about that?
When you remember a saying you can't relearn
what's so funny about that?

chorus

And I know you are never wrong
I know you are never wrong
I was not weak but the drink was strong
I know you are never wrong

I think I'm hyper enough as it is
