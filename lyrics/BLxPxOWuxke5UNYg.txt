Hear the call of the wild in us all
It waits for the night to fall
I'm getting hot, I'm ready for the night
No holdin' back, let's ball
I'm gonna give all you can take all night
Leave you in the morning feeling right

I'm an animal, there's an animal in me, woah
We're gonna set it free
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me, woah
We're gonna set it free

I've been looking, you've been watching from the side
There's some things you just can't hide
Ooh, you're getting wet, you're working up a sweat
Your hairs standing up on end
Your skin is screaming, glad we met?
Tonight's one night, you won't forget

I'm an animal, there's an animal in me, woah
We're gonna set it free
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me, woah
We're gonna set it free

I'm an animal, I'm an animal
I'm an animal, I'm an animal
I'm an animal, I'm an animal
I'm an animal, I'm an animal

I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
I'm gonna set it free
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me, woah
I'm gonna set it, I'm gonna set it, I'm gonna set it free

I'm an animal, animal in me
I'm gonna set it free, I'm gonna set it free, I'm gonna set it free
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me, woah
I'm gonna set it, I'm gonna set it, I'm gonna set it free
