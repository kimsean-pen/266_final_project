For the swarms will come,
And reap your day dreams of love and hope,
For the fears and blood stained faith,
Are woven through her yeam of war.

And the sadder song of broken wings,
Heard through the battered pavement among this city,
Deafening, it betrays me in the sweetest,
And of the greatest of dreams.

These moments can't avoid you,
Your tired faith cannot erase you,
Tonight the lonesome sky opens wide,
Forgive me, 2 a.m. my city lights burn bright as day.

Catching the flattering silhouettes of the tired,
And the damned,
I am tapped clean of respect,
And I'm walking waist deep in ruin.

If this is need then I never wanted you,
This is a monument to our everything,
Before our forever comes crashing,
I loved you.
