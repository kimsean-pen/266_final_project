Do just what you want to
But keep in mind if you do I'll be gone
By tomorrow if you don't leave her
I'm a ghost

Sleep with who you want to
But if it's not me then I won't be here to see
By tomorrow sleep with me or
I'm a ghost

Do what makes you happy
But I won't stay here as long as you make me sad
By tomorrow if you don't love me
I'm a ghost
