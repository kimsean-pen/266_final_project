She's cold & she's cruel but she knows what she's doin'
She pushed me in the pool at our last school reunion
She laughs at my dreams but I dream about her laughter
Strange as it seems, she's the one I'm after

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself, I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery, she's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for

She can't keep a secret for more than an hour
She runs on 100 proof attitude power
And the more she ignores me, the more I adore her
What can I do? I'd do anything for her

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself, I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery, she's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for

And when she sees it's me on her caller ID
She won't pick up the phone, she'd rather be alone
But I can't give up just yet 'cause every word that she's ever said
Is still ringin' in my head

She's cold & she's cruel but she knows what she's doin'
Knows just what to say so my whole day is ruined

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself, I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery, she's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself, I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery, she's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more

Oh, I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for
Just the girl I'm lookin' for
I'm lookin' for
Just the girl I'm lookin' for
