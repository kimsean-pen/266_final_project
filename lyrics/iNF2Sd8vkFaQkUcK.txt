Maybe it's too late for intellectual debate
But a residue of confusion remains

Oh, changing with the times and amphetamine tortured minds
Are the average citizen's sources of pain

Yeah (Tell me what we're fighting for)
I don't remember anymore
Only temporary reprieve

And the world might cease
If we fail to tame the beast
From the faith that you release
Comes an atheist peace

Atheist peace

Political forces ran
Critical winds of discontent
And the modern age emerged triumphantly
But now it seems we've stalled
And it's time to de-evolve
And relive the dark chapters of history

Yeah (Tell me what we're fighting for)
No progress ever came from war
Only a false sense of increase

And the world won't wait
For the truth upon a plate
But we're ready now to feast on an atheist peace
Oh, yeah

Oh, an atheist peace
