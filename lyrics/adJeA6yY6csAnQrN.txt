I think I'm having a heart attack
A full blown arrest of the cardiac
Got to get it under control
Cause this whole thing's gonna take me down
Still I'm bound to end up six feet under the ground
Under the ground
And I'll take you with me if I go down

Cause I don't want to live a day
Without a piece of you to keep me company
Cause I've always had the trouble with authorities
Still breathing down your neck as a priority
Cause I don't want to live another day
Without your company

I'm think I'm talking us half to death
So let me take a breath
So I can learn a little more about you
I can't hear thing
You're breaking up, you're breaking up
Did you fall asleep
Cause I won't sleep or wake at all
While I lie wondering why
Everytime I wake up I just find you sleeping in
What to make of my situation
Destined to end this way
Heavy the crown, heavy the crown
But I'll take you with me if I go down

Cause I don't want to live a day
Without a piece of you to keep me company
Cause I've always had the trouble with authorities
Still breathing down your neck as a priority
Cause I don't want to live another day
Without your company

Feel the earthquake beneath you
As I slowly disappear in each wake
Feel your bones break
As I pull you in closer and closer
Until I find the right piece of you to take

Cause I don't want to live a day
Without a piece of you to keep me company
Cause I've always had the trouble with authorities
Still breathing down your neck as a priority
Cause I don't want to live another day
Without your company
Cause I don't want to live a day
I don't want to live a day
Without a piece of you to keep me company
A piece of you, a piece of you
Cause I've always had the trouble with authorities
Still breathing down your neck as a priority
Cause I don't want to live another day
Without your company
