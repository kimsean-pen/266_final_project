Folding my clothes
And I feel useless
Don't think I know
How to do this

Once I was told
But like any misfit
I spit on some good advice

Out in the cold
And tryin' to make fire
Two sticks and stone
Still got no fire

Once I was shown
But I was inside then
And spit on that good advice

Wisdom, wisdom
Where can I get some?
Wisdom, wisdom

On the payroll
And digging up ditches
Dollar is low
So are my wages

Once I was told
Just how to get rich
But I spit on that good advice

Wisdom, wisdom
Where can I get some?
Wisdom, wisdom

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Wisdom, wisdom

Where can I get some?
Wisdom, wisdom

I wanna trade my dimwits in for tips
Tips equipped with

Wisdom, wisdom

Take off my clothes
And I feel useless
Don't think I know
How to do this

Once I was told
But I liked to fidget
And miss out on good advice
