Don't stand next to me and think it
Comes so easy, I am not your toy
Coz you think love is something new,
But it is just a tool to make it alright
Push me to the floor don't give up
Until I'm begging you for more
I'll be thinking of the time I felt inspired
Don't stand next to me I love the smell
Of ecstasy it makes me feel inspired
Coz you think love is like a sunrise
Up against you, somehow you're
Always right
Push me to the floor don't give up
Until I'm begging you for more
I'll be thinking of the time I felt inspired
Push me to the floor, make me think
That you're the one that I adore
It reminds me of a time I felt inspired
Your worth is worth is worth nothing when it's
At someone else's cost
Fortune's not appreciated when the
Sweet stuff comes to fast
Push me to the floor don't give up
Until I'm begging you for more
I'll be thinking of the time I felt inspired
Push me to the floor, make me think
That you're the one that I adore
It reminds me of a time I felt inspired
Your worth is worth is worth nothing when it's
At someone else's cost
Fortune's not appreciated when the
Sweet stuff comes to fast
Push me to the floor don't give up
Until I'm begging you for more
I'll be thinking of the time I felt inspired
Push me to the floor, make me think
That you're the one that I adore
It reminds me of a time I felt inspired
