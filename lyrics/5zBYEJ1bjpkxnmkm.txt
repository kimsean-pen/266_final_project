I had it in my head, what I meant to say
This conversation isn't headed that way
I got a bad connection
Between my mind and my mouth
With the right intentions
All the wrong came out

Ooh, you're so good to me
You're my therapy

I know that I got hang-ups
Baby please don't hang up
I just need you, just need you to talk to
Yeah my ego's pretty banged up
So please don't turn the pain up
I just need you, just need you to talk to
(Don't you know that, know that)

Everybody got their crazy
And I got, I got a little more
I'm just saying don't give up
('Cause I know that, know that)
I know that I got hang-ups
But baby please don't hang up
(But baby please don't hang up)

I had it worked out, what I meant to say
But this conversation isn't going my way
I got bad reception
Between my heart and my head
With the best intentions
It was the worst I said

Ooh, you're so good to me
Be my therapy

I know that I got hang-ups
Baby please don't hang up
I just need you, just need you to talk to
Yeah my ego's pretty banged up
So please don't turn the pain up
I just need you, just need you to talk to
(Don't you know that, know that)

Everybody got their crazy
And I got, I got a little more
I'm just saying don't give up
('Cause I know that, know that)
I know that I got hang-ups
But baby please don't hang up

Who got, who got, who got
Who don't got hang ups?

Who got, who got, who got
Who don't got hang ups?

I know that I got hang-ups
Baby please don't hang up
I just need you, just need you to talk to
Yeah my ego's pretty banged up
So please don't turn the pain up
I just need you, just need you to talk to

Who got, who got, who got
Who don't got hang ups?

Who got, who got, who got
Who don't got hang ups?

Who don't got hang ups?

Who don't got hang ups?
