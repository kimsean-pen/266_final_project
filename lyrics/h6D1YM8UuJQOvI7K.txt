When I was just a little girl
My mama used to tuck me into bed
And she'd read me a story

It always was about a princess in distress
And how a guy would save her
And end up with the glory

I'd lie in bed and think about
The person that I wanted to be

Then one day I realized
The fairy tale life wasn't for me

I don't wanna be like Cinderella
Sitting in a dark, cold, dusty cellar
Waiting for somebody to come and set me free
I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting
For a handsome prince to come and save me
On a horse of white, unless we're riding side by side
Don't wanna depend on no one else
I'd rather rescue myself

Oh yeah

Someday im gonna find someone
Who wants my soul, heart and mind
Who's not afraid to show that he loves me

Somebody who will understand I'm happy just the way I am
Don't need nobody taking care of me

(I will be there)I will be there for him
Just as strong as he will be there for me
When I give myself then it has got to be an equal thing

I don't wanna be like Cinderella
Sitting in a dark, cold, dusty cellar
Waiting for somebody to come and set me free
I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting
For a handsome prince to come and save me
On a horse of white, unless we're riding side by side
Don't wanna depend on no one else
I'd rather rescue myself

I can slay (I can slay) my own dragons
I can dream my own dreams (Dream, my own dreams)
My knight in shining armor is me
So I'm gonna set me free

Like Cinderella, old, dusty cellar
Waiting for somebody to come and set me free
I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting
For a handsome prince to come and save me

I don't wanna be like Cinderella
Sitting in a dark, cold, dusty cellar
Waiting for somebody to come and set me free
I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting
For a handsome prince to come and save me
On a horse of white, unless we're riding side by side
Don't wanna depend on no one else
I'd rather rescue myself

I don't wanna be like Cinderella
Sitting in a dark, cold, dusty cellar
Waiting for somebody to come and set me free
I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting
For a handsome prince to come and save me
On a horse of white, unless we're riding side by side
Don't wanna depend on no one else
I'd rather rescue myself
