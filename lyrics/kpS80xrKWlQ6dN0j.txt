There's no one around
But the two old-timers
Who visit when they're in town
The credits are rolling as they walk out

I get to my screen
With the phantom audience sat there waiting for me
But they don't complain where I take a seat
It seems

Even now, I still stop by
Most stories look better wide
And I feel appeased here, 'cause

While the adverts might've changed
The popcorn tastes the same
And in the end the day's always saved
So once the picture stops
I let the hours pass, distracted in the dark

Even now, I still stop by
Most stories look better wide
And I feel appeased here, until

The lights come up bright
When it's over
I step outside and I think of my cats
And dream of somewhere nice
Tonight
