Down on the West Coast, they got a sayin'
If you're not drinking, then you're not playing
But you got the music, you got the music in you, don't you?

Down on the West Coast, I get this feeling
Like it all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment, boy blue, yeah, you

Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
The silver starlets, their queens of Saigons
And you got the music, you got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West Coast, they love their movies

Their Golden Gods and rock 'n' roll groupies
And you got the music, you got the music in you, don't you?
You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hot and on fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
, boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, your love
