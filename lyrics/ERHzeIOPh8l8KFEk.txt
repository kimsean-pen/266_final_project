From the glowing fragments of what remains
The soul shall rise from amongst the flames
From smoldering ruins the power grows
Feel the pulse of fear as we regain control

From the ashes of a million dead
The children of tomorrow now are led
Into the darkness as emotions slowly fade
Memories of the past cannot be saved

Bowing down to face your new found life
There is no escape, you must comply
This resurrected hate can't be denied

Asking for redemption - we laugh and look away
There shall be no exception - Revenge on man begins today

You thought that it was all over
But it's only just begun
For your life is mortal
Look to what fate will become

Learn to live afraid of what may be
For we possess this world - All that you see
Your life is no more than a game to me

Visions of the future reflected in the past
Existing in the present which cannot surely last
From the void terror takes its hold
Face the wrath as history unfolds
