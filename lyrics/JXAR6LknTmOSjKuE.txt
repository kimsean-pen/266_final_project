I'm standing in the field
My feet lift off the ground
No one here will see me
No one will hurt me now

I'm brushing off the rain
While climbing through the clouds
Nobody can see me
No one can hurt me now

Goodbye, gravity
Goodbye, enemies
I'm going up to a place where the world is small
Where I can fly above it all
If I don't make it, sing my song
From here I'm weightless
No stars are famous
And the world is small
And the world is small...

Still rising towards the dark
Don't care what's down below
'Cause no one can see me
And no one has to know

The atmosphere is lonely
And beautiful
I don't miss a thing I used to know
I used to know

Goodbye, gravity
Goodbye, enemies
I'm going up to a place where the world is small
Where I can fly above it all
If I don't make it, sing my song
From here I'm weightless
No stars are famous
And the world is small
I feel so tall...

If there's nothing to break my fall
It's OK, I've seen it all
And maybe I was always small
But I could fly before I crawled

If I don't make it, sing my song
From here I'm weightless
No stars are famous
And the world is small
And the world is small...
