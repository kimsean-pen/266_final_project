I can't ever have you, no no
You're perfect and I'm garbage, u know

You don't even drink
We have no way of getting close

But I keep looking at you
It's like I'm Captain Hook and you're Wendy, staying next to Peter Pan
I'll buy you an alligator bag
But you're innocent and you say you only want an eco tote bag

You're like an alien
Your smile is so beautiful
Take me too, to the place you live
Young girl, you're such a warm person

You're so pretty, like a gem
But you don't act crazy, I'm confused
Understand my language

The way to express you is that
You're an alien, an alien
You're like an alien
You make it hard for me to approach you
Because once the tainted me approaches you
I'm afraid you'll get ruined
I don't wanna love u
But I'm loving u right now

You're different from them
You're not a fox, you're a human
I'm living in a winter kingdom
But you're a warm spring breeze
You drive a nail into my heart
You're the one who taught me
That I even have a heart
I'm not garbage anymore
Baby, I wanna immigrate to your country
Take me to the place where flowers bloom
If I get to have your tears
That means it's our 100 days

Even if you fall in love
The only thing remaining after time is attachment
So instead of being in love
I'd rather play games and drink beer
I like darkness more than brightness
Because the darkness hides me
But you changed all of that
When you shine on me with your smile
What if I'm not good enough? I'm becoming shapeless
Before it wasn't a big deal
But now I'm smiling like you and am happy
Before, I took everything for granted
But you change me, my girl

You make it hard for me to approach you
Because once the tainted me approaches you
I'm afraid you'll run away
I don't wanna love u
But I'm loving u right now
