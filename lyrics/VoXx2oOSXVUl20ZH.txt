what makes you think that you're not one of us?

if you make it up and start to use your mind
it isn't difficult you don't know what's there if you don't try

ordinary, ordinary
a look in the mirror is not enough
what makes you think that you're not one of us?
a look in the mirror is not enough
what makes you think that you're not one of us?

what makes you think that you're not one of us?
