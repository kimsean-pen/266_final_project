Snowqueen of Texas
Left Paris in a cloud of smoke
They say that she may be beaten
But I know that she's not broke

She's living in a cool green farmhouse
If you go to Houston be quiet as a mouse

Met a man in Beirut
Having her name tattooed on his arm
(Ooh, a Deborah forever)
Boots of Spanish leather
I never meant you any harm

I'm on my knees, your majesty
Snowqueen, save a cold kiss of me
I'm on my knees your majesty

Snowqueen of Texas
Left Paris in a cloud of smoke
They say that she may be beaten
But I know that she's not broke

She's living in a cool green farmhouse
If you go to Houston be quiet as a mouse

She's mending a fairy tale
Reading her heart
(Ooh, a Deborah forever)
That's a good motto
For some jokeman's card

I'm on my knees, your majesty
Snowqueen, save a cold kiss of me

I'm on my knees your majesty
(I'm on my knees your majesty)
I'm on my knees your majesty
(I'm on my knees your majesty)
I'm on my knees your majesty

Snowqueen save a cold kiss of me
