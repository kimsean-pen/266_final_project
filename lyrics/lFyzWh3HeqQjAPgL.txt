I question it all
I've never sang of love before
The day I lost my head
And I can't feel you here again
Don't you tell me this is life
I hold my breath just to see if I'm even alive
I'm so certain it saved my life again
It's so compelling how you still feel on my skin
The light it spills from your complexion
If I need you's a simple thing to say
My assumptions form in misdirection
Forgive my absent mind I'm forgetting everything my darling
And the light it leads me somewhere else
I need you more than I thought I could ever now
It saves me how
And with that you'll sway and I remain the peaceful day you let in
And I'll remain the peaceful days
I can't feel you here again
I question it all
I've never sang of love before
The day I lost my head
And I can't feel you here again
