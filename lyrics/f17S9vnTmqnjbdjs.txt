And the sign says: Long hair freaky people need not apply
So I put my hair under my hat and I went in to ask him why
He said: You look like a fine outstanding young man
I think you'll do
So I took off my hat I said: Imagine that, huh, me working for you

Signs, signs
Everywhere there's signs
Fucking up the scenery
Breaking my mind
Do this, don't do that
Can't you read the sign?

And the sign says: Anybody caught trespassing will be shot on sight
So I jumped the fence and I yelled at the house
Hey, what gives you the right?
To put up a fence and keep me out
Or to keep mother nature in
If God was here he'd tell it to your face
Man you're some kind of sinner

Signs, signs
Everywhere there's signs
Fucking up the scenery
Breaking my mind
Do this, don't do that
Can't you read the sign?

Oh, say now mister, can't you read?
You got to have a shirt and tie to get a seat
You can't watch, no, you can't eat
You ain't supposed to be here
And the sign says: You got to have a membership card to get inside
Huh

And the sign says: Everybody welcome, come in and kneel down and pray
But then they passed around a plate at the end of it all
And I didn't have a penny to pay
So I got me a pen and paper and I made up my own fucking sign
I said: Thank you Lord for thinking about me, I'm alive and doing fine

Oh, signs signs
Everywhere there's signs
Fucking up the scenery
Breaking my mind
Do this, don't do that
Can't you read the sign?

Signs, signs
Everywhere there's signs
Fucking up the scenery
Breaking my mind
Do this, don't do that
Can't you read the sign?
