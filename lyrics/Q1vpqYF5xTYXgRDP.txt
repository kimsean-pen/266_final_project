The car won't start, it's falling apart
I was late for work and the boss got smart
My pantyline shows got a run in my hose
My hair went flat, man I hate that

Just when I thought things couldn't get worse
I realized I forgot my purse
With all this stress I must confess
This could be worse than P M S

This job ain't worth the pay
Can't wait till the end of the day
Hey, honey, I'm on my way
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh by the way
Rub my feet, gimme something to eat
Fix me up my favorite treat

Honey, I'm back, my head's killing me
I need to relax and watch TV
Get off the phone give the dog a bone
Hey, hey, honey I'm home

I broke a nail opening the mail
I cursed out loud 'cause it hurt like hell
This job's a pain, it's so mundane
It sure don't stimulate my brain

This job ain't worth the pay
Can't wait till the end of the day
Hey, honey, I'm on my way
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
And rub my feet, gimme something to eat
And fix me up my favorite treat

Honey, I'm back, my head's killing me
I need to relax and watch TV
Get off the phone give the dog a bone
Hey, hey, now honey, I'm home

Oh, rub my neck will you, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh by the way
Rub my feet, gimme something to eat
Fix me up my favorite treat
Honey, I'm back, my head's killing me
I need to relax and watch TV
Get off the phone-give the dog a bone
Hey, hey, now honey, I'm home
I'm home, that feels much better
