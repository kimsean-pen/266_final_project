Ya'll ready for this?
Get down with the style. House on the ground
Please when i squeeze. Pump to your knees.
Who wants to play? I'm in here to stay
Ready to take you around the way
So get ready for this. Mind your own biz
Cause i invented the microphone biz.
No need to sit, cause we're 2 unlimited
Ready, ready, ready for this!

Feel the base, you just get closer.
Be impressed by the words i chose of
Once again kickin' it live
Doin' everything yo just to survive
A wall to wall, i think i stand
Being on stage with a mic in my hand
Bustin' it live to the crowd
The age is 20, i'm from the south!

Be a part
Break my heart.

Get ready for this. Mind your own biz.
People in the front. Show me what you want
And i won't give it in. Get ready for this!
We're 2 unlimited. So people won't you sit?
Movin' up and down.
Dancin' on the ground.
Feelin' kinda free; security.
House is style that moves you from the ground.
House on the ground, bass in your face
Racin' the place, no time to waste.
Feelin' hypnotised. I can see it in your eyes.
Feelin' kinda better. Put on your sweater.
Feelin' like a white. I think it doesn't matter.

Super, dope, def, and even outrageous.
If i was an animal, theyd've kept me in cages
So get ready for this! Ya'll ready for this?
Step back, relax. don't you wanna come in?
When i start rappin' the girlies wanna come in.

Be a part
Break my heart.
Get ready for this. Mind your own biz.
People in the front. Show me what you want
And i won't give it in. Get ready for this!
We're 2 unlimited. So people won't you sit?
Movin' up and down.
