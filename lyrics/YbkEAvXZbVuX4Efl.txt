Been a whole lot easier since the bitch left town
Been a whole lot happier without her face around
Nobody upstairs gonna stomp and shout
Nobody at the back door gonna throw my laundry out
She hold the shotgun while you do-si-do
She want one man made of Hercules and Cyrano
Been a whole lot easier since the bitch is gone
Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss Can't Be Wrong
Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss Can't Be Wrong
Ain't nobody gonna bow no more
When you sound your gong
Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss Can't Be Wrong
What'cha gonna do
To get into another one of these rock 'n' roll songs

Other peoples thoughts they ain't your hand-me-downs
Would it be so bad to simply turn around
You cook so well, all nice and French
You do your brain surgery too, mama
With your monkey wrench
Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss Can't Be Wrong
Ain't nobody gonna bow no more
When you sound your gong
Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss Can't Be Wrong
What'cha gonna do
To get into another one of these rock 'n' roll songs
Yeah ya can't be wrong, no no no
Can't be wrong
Oh, ya can't be wrong
You can't be wrong
You can't be wrong, oh no you

I hope them cigarettes are gonna make you cough
I hope you hear this song and it pissed you off
I take that back, I hope your doing fine
And if I had a dollar I might give you ninety-nine
Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss Can't Be Wrong
Ain't nobody gonna bow no more
When you sound your gong
Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss Can't Be Wrong
What'cha gonna do
To get into another one of these rock 'n' roll songs
Oh, Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss
Can't Be Wrong
No no no no no no no
Oh, you can't be wrong
No, you can't be wrong
Ya can't be wrong
Oh, Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss
Can't Be Wrong, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh you can't be wrong
Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss Can't Be Wrong
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
