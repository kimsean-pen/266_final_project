Who holds the silver string
Lost me to staggered motion
When you run away
Whoever changes shape
Showing obsoletion
I'll see you there

Alternate the day
Scream the last charade
Your Entropy
The fragment that anchors it all
(to the wall)
Separate the wave (let it go)
Drown inside the shade (let it go)

The vision that anchors it all (into the wall)

And I'm forgetting everything you've said
For you to bounce right back
Pick up right where you left off
When you run away
Whoever tunes my pace
Showing obsoletion

I see you there
(And how it seemed I should be reborn)

Alternate the day
Scream the last charade
Your entropy
The fragment that anchors it all (into the wall)

Separate the wave (let it go)
Drown inside the shade (let it go)
The vision that anchors it all (into the wall)

In the outline there's a test
Where it all gets set on it
There's no structure to my atrophy
There's a padlock on the chest
Where it all gets hidden in
There's no pattern to my apathy
Oh
There's impostors in my atrophy
Oh
There's no structure to my apathy
Oh
Alternate the day
Scream the last charade
Your entropy
The fragment that anchors it all (into the wall)
Separate the wave (let it go)
Drown inside the shade (let it go)
The vision that anchors it all (into the wall)
