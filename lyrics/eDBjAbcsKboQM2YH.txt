Run to a brighter day
Feel the light upon your face
We're on our way to the sun
Living and let the fire burn
Welcome to the point of no return
We're going back to the start

What can we do now?
Now life is blurry
What can we do now?
Share the love
What are we doing here?
Now life is hunting us into the wrong

Until we run
High of the love we'd rather be living on
(Faces in the sun)
Until we run
High of the love we'd rather be living on
Living on

This world is yours and mine
You gotta take a step across the line
We're going back to the start
I'm about to blow my mind
Watch me as I'm longing to feel alive
We're running into the night

What can we do now?
Now life is blurry
What can we do now?
Share the love
What are we doing here?
Now life is hunting us into the wrong

Until we run
High of the love we'd rather be living on
(Faces in the sun)
Until we run
High of the love we'd rather be living on
Living on

(Until we run, until we run)

Until we run
High of the love we'd rather be living on
Until we run
High of the love we'd rather be living on
Living on

(Until we run, until we run)
Until we run
High of the love we'd rather be living on
(Faces in the sun)
Until we run
High of the love we'd rather be living on
Living on
