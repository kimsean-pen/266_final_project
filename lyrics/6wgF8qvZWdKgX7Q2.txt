Just a spoon full of sugar
Makes the medicine go down
Sweet Mary-Jane won't you lay me down
Lost my heart in California, lost my mind
Shot me down with a revolver, got me high
Then a heart of gold came on the stereo
Mr Young made me cry
Then all the colours of the rainbow
Fell in my eyes

I lost my mind long ago
Down that yellow brick road
I lost my mind long ago
Down that yellow brick road

Took a train to the river
Where I dove right in
That skinny dippin' girl
Made the blue bird sing
Fell in love in California, she blew my mind
She shot me down with her revolver
She got me high
Then the weather man came on the radio
Said there be sunshine
Then all the colours of the rainbow
Fell in my mind

I lost my mind long ago
Down that yellow brick road
I lost my mind long ago
Down that yellow brick road

I lost my mind long ago
Down that yellow brick road
I lost my mind long ago
Down that yellow brick road
