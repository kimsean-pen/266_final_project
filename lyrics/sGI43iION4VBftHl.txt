Yes, me friend,
We deh a street again.
Yes, me friend, me good friend,
Dem say we free again.
The bars could not hold me;
Force could not control me now.
They try to keep me down, yeah!
But Jah put I around. Yeah!

Yes, I've been accused many a times
And wrongly abused, now.

They've got to turn me loose.

O-o-oh! O-o-ooh! Oh! Don't try to cold me up on this bridge, now.
I've got to reach Mount Zion -
The highest region.
So if you a bull-bucka,
Let me tell you this -
I'm a duppy conqueror - conqueror. Oh, yeah!
