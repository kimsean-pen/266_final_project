We are fresh strawberries
Fresh burst of red strawberries
Ripe turning riper in the pole
We will soon be rotten
We will all be forgotten
Half remembered rumours of the old

So wouldn't it be easy with
Something to believe in
That could give us more
Then here's my work
So where's my beta pi
But i don't need
Wouldn't it be easy to believe...
To believe...

Please believe
Everybody steals
But i believe there's nothing to believe
But i love the manual the
Instruction manual
Or liars swear that never lie

Wouldn't it be easy with
Something to believe in
That could give us more
Then here's my years
So now they've gone in stride
For me to leave
Wouldn't it be easy to believe...
To believe

Wouldn't it be easy to believe?
Wouldn't it be easy to believe?

We are fresh strawberries
Fresh burst of red strawberries
Ripe turning riper in the soul

Wouldn't it be easy
Something could give us more

I don't know
No I don't know
I don't know what I need

Wouldn't it be easy
Wouldn't it be easy
Wouldn't it be easy
To believe
