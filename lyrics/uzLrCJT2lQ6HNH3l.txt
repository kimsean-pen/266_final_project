I'm wearing rose-tinted shades, but all I see is shades of
My imagination covered in red
A crooked smile and some fake love, put me in these handcuffs
Threw away the keys 'cause I was a threat

Well, first you try to tell me that we're family
Then you try to tell me that it's for the best
You promise that you'll be there if I need you
But I don't need your handout, you can take it back

I won't be used
My mama didn't raise no fool
Won't let you leave me hanging, so cut me loose
My mama didn't raise no fool
Won't let you leave me hanging, no more
Won't let you leave me hanging, no more
Won't let you leave me hanging, no more

I got a pain in my backbone, where'd you get that knife from?
Why the hell is it so covered in red?
I let you walk into my home, let you make it your own
You tried to tear it down and leave me for dead

Well, first you try to tell me that we're family
Then you try to tell me that it's for the best
You promise that you'll be there if I need you
But I don't need your handout, you can take it back

I won't be used
My mama didn't raise no fool
Won't let you leave me hanging, so cut me loose
My mama didn't raise no fool
Won't let you leave me hanging, no more
Won't let you leave me hanging, no more
Won't let you leave me hanging, no more

Ladies and gentlemen, if you're sick of being disrespected
Let me hear you sing it, go

I don't wanna feel like my money that you're spending
No, I don't wanna feel like I'm losing 'cause you're winning, baby
I don't wanna feel like my money that you're spending
No, I don't wanna feel like I'm losing 'cause you're winning

I won't be used
My mama didn't raise no fool
Won't let you leave me hanging, so cut me loose
My mama didn't raise no fool
Won't let you leave me hanging
I won't be used
My mama didn't raise no fool
Won't let you leave me hanging, so cut me loose
My mama didn't raise no fool
Won't let you leave me hanging, no more
Won't let you leave me hanging, no more
Won't let you leave me hanging
Won't let you leave me hanging
Won't let you leave me hanging
