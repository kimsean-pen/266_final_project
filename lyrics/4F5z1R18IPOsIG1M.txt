I still feel your kisses in the morning
Even though you're not around
Maybe I should take it as a warning
That my secret's finally out

And you know that I know that you know just how I feel
And I know that you know that I know this thing's for real
We lay low but it never feels boring
'Cause my heart is racing for you

Let's just sit back and cruise, cruise, cruise
That's all I wanna do, do, do
I know you want it, too, too, too
It's perfect 'cause there's never any pressure, baby
You know how to keep it cool

Funny how you get me so excited
When we're doing nothing at all
Simple as a movie at the drive in
Or a good long distance call

But you know that I know that you know just how I feel
And I know that you know that I know this thing's for real
Let's speed off right into the horizon
Or just close our eyes and fall

Let's just sit back and cruise, cruise, cruise
That's all I wanna do, do, do
I know you want it, too, too, too
It's perfect 'cause there's never any pressure, baby
You know how to keep it cool

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Keep it cool
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Me and you
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Keep it cool
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Me and you

Let's just sit back and cruise, cruise, cruise
That's all I wanna do, do, do
I know you want it, too, too, too
It's perfect 'cause there's never any pressure, baby
You know how to keep it cool

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Keep it cool
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Me and you
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Keep it cool
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Me and you
