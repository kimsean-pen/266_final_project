Want to write poetry about your spine
Show you how truth can smell like
Adriatic Sea and suspense
Let you meet my childhood's mulberry alleys

Dance in cornfields
Dive through waterfalls
Leave my inside in your hands
I identify myself with

The sadness in your eyes
With you I want to feel again
Move by your side
Show you there's no one like you
Show you there's no one but you
Show you how it's only you

Leave my thoughts tonight
Leave my thoughts tonight

Leave my thoughts tonight
If not forever, only for tonight
Leave me with the sight
Of beholding your eyes

Leave my thoughts tonight
Leave my thoughts tonight
Leave my thoughts tonight
Leave my thoughts tonight

The sadness in your eyes
With you I want to feel again
Move by your side
Show you there's no one like you
Show you there's no one but you
Show you how it's only you

Leave my thoughts tonight
Leave my thoughts tonight
Leave my thoughts tonight
Leave my thoughts tonight
