I see blue
I see black
I see you
In a crack

I see snow [icy snow?]
I see cold [icy cold?]
I see someone
Getting old

and it's cold outside
so cold outside

I need pink
I need green
I need someone
Who sews up seams [Whose soul's obscene?]*

I need everything

But it's cold outside
So cold outside

I see all the colors of the spring
I see you wearing my ring

And it's warmer outside
It's so much warmer outside

and it's warmer

Still you're there

I see you
in a crack
crack...
crack...
I will crack
