A sin to some, accident's dying
The desperate need to have it all
Body snatchers, death for dining
A floating house, mouth full of bones

It's the end of my bloodline
It's mine and you're greedy, it's mine
It's the end of my bloodline
It's mine and you're greedy, it's mine

There's little truth in power's timing
Its desperate need to have it all
On my device, the silver lining
Misplaced your faith, leave me alone

It's the end of my bloodline
It's mine and you're greedy, it's mine
It's the end of my bloodline
It's mine and you're greedy, it's mine

It's mine and you're greedy
It's mine and you're greedy
It's mine and you're greedy
It's mine and you're greedy

It's the end of my bloodline
It's mine and you're greedy, it's mine
It's the end of my bloodline
It's mine and you're greedy, it's mine
