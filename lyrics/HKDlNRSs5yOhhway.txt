I am a pilgrim and a stranger
Travelling through this wearisome land
I've got a home in
That yonder city, good Lord
And it's not
Not made by hand

I've got a mother, sister and a brother
Who have gone this way before
I am determined
To go and see them, good Lord
For they're on
That other shore

I'm goin' down to the river of Jordan
Just to bathe my wearisome soul
If I can just touch
The hem of his garment, good Lord
Then I'd know he'd take me home

I am a pilgrim and a stranger
Travelling through this wearisome land
I've got a home in
That yonder city, good Lord
And it's not
Not made by hand
