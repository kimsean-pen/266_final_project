Skinny was born in a bathtub
And he grew so incredibly
Even the end of an eyedropper
sucked him in

Skinny never knew any questiong
Skinny never looked at the lights
But Skinny sold something
every single night

Skinny sold a soldier to me
Skinny sold a wife
Skinny sold a suction cup
And a knife
Skinny found a Hello Dolly
record in the hall
He sold it to a truck driver
in the fall
