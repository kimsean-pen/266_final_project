Say will you stand up for Christ and combat

Ride
defend, the Kingdom of God
alive in the conquest of Normans
Crossed the land, to Byzantine shores
we storm Constantinople's walls
Gone ahead, the army went on
arrived at the river of Jordan
Brave the dread, Jerusalem's sons
and one-by-one the pilgrims fall

And by the city of Siron
their bodies lying to rot
and underneath blood and iron
lies, the promise and honour of God

Say will you stand up for Christ and combat
Will you fight like a rebel, a rebel in black
Saw will you sand up for Christ and combat
Will you sanctify the dark?

Kill and pray, crusaders at heart
in 1097 we started
Lost the way, and spread all apart
the Holy Roman Empire
The remaining knights, prepared for attack
to honour the Prophet departed
on they fought, with no turning back
the kingdom shine forever more

And by the city of Siron
their bodies lying to rot
and underneath blood and iron
lies, the promise and honour of God

Go straight to heaven for Christ and combat
give your life for the Sanctum that you never had
Take place in heaven for Christ and combat
gone to sanctify the dark

Christ
Christ and combat
Christ and combat
Christ and in heaven we are

Christ
Christ and combat
Christ and combat
Christ and in heaven we are

Christ
Christ and combat
Christ and combat
Christ and in heaven we are
Christ
Christ and combat
Christ and combat
Christ and combat
Ten thousand men died for Christ and combat
gone as mighty crusaders and never came back
ascend to heaven for Christ and combat
in remembrance of the dark
Say will you stand up for Christ and combat
