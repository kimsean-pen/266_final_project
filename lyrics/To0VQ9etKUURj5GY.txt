If you give me this battle, I'll give you the war
I'm tired of being someone's
I'm tired of keeping score
This tourniquet hasn't stopped the bleeding yet

If you give me this battle
I'll pretend like there isn't a lifetime
Of bitterness inside of me
An ugliness I hide from you
So give me that goddamn bottle
And then leave me alone

This tourniquet hasn't stopped the bleeding yet
I fear that I might lose a limb
Or a wife
Or whatever's left inside

This tourniquet hasn't stopped the bleeding yet
I fear that I might bleed out
