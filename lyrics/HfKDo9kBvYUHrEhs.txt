I'm jealous at heart
we sat in the car
I thought you would be different
The sun and the stars are falling apart
over and over

Cause you think that I wasn't
Only for you baby
Well I've got news for you
I really just think that
I'm not sick (never giving me credit)
Losing it (never tryin' to pretend that)
Can't do this (I really just think that)

I'm feelin' the scars
as deep as they are
I found someone different
Keep going so far
away from the start
showing progress

Cause you think that I wasn't
Only for you baby
Well I've got news for you
I really just think that
I'm not sick (never giving me credit)
Losing it (never tryin' to pretend that)
Can't do this (I really just think that)

I'm not sick (never giving me credit)
Losing it (never tryin' to pretend that)
Can't do this (I really just think that)

We in the sun and we're movin'
We're goin' down the boulevard and we're cruisin'
to the beat and I flow with the groove and you know it
