He's sinking faster than a drowning man
He'll grab a hold of anyone he can
Gun in his pocket and a heart of ham
Uncle Sam

He's dying faster than a rabid dog
Infect us all now he's losing blood
Nose for trouble and a soul of rock
Smokey's man

Don't drag me down
I don't wanna drown
You're going down
Hey, hey

See his face
There's not much flesh
Just skin and bone
And cheeks sunk deep
Eyes popping wide

Don't put out a hand to help him
This drowning man will bite it right off
Right off, right off
Right off, right off

Don't drag me down
I don't wanna drown
You're going down
Ha

He's selling faster than a magazine
Infect us all with his TV screen
He's selling faster than a magazine
Infect us all with his TV screen
He's selling faster than a magazine
Infect us all with his TV screen
He's selling faster than a magazine
Infect us all with his TV screen

You're going down

Going down, girl
Going
Going down, girl
Going down, girl
Going down, girl
