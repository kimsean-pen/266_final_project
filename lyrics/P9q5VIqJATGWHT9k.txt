Wait up
I'm coming to you
I know it's been awhile, but
I thought
I might fall through
You knew me as a child, love
I'd never known any city big enough to shake us
Now we've allowed time and space to build a wall an break us

Would you let me know
I can do this on my own
I keep it together
I keep it together
In all kinds of weather with you in my mind

Come on
You know how I do
My pride is pilot always
Are we
Just dazed and confused
Or better in the old days
I'd never known any city big enough to shake us

Would you let me know
I can do this on my own
I keep it together
I keep it together
In all kinds of weather with you in my mind

Would you let me know
I can do this on my own
I keep it together
I keep it together
In all kinds of weather with you in my mind

Would you let me know
I can do this on my own
I keep it together
I keep it together
In all kinds of weather with you in my mind

Would you let me know
Would you let me know
Would you let me know
Would you let me know
