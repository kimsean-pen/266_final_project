Time is going by
So much faster than I
And I'm starting to regret not spending all of it with you

Now I'm, wondering why I've kept this bottled inside
So I'm starting to regret not telling all of it to you
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know

You're never gonna be alone
From this moment on
If you ever feel like letting go

I won't let you fall
You're never gonna be alone
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone

And now as long as I can
I'm holding on with both hands
'Cause forever I believe
That there's nothing I could need but you
So if I haven't yet
I've gotta let you know

You're never gonna be alone
From this moment on
If you ever feel like letting go
I won't let you fall

When all hope is gone
I know that you can carry on
We're gonna take the world on
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone

Ooh oh
You've gotta live every single day
Like it's the only one
What if tomorrow never comes?

Don't let it slip away, could be our only one
You know it's only just begun
Every single day may be our only one

What if tomorrow never comes?
Tomorrow never comes?

Time is going by
So much faster than I
I'm starting to regret not telling all of this to you

You're never gonna be alone
From this moment on
If you ever feel like letting go

I won't let you fall
When all hope is gone
I know that you can carry on
We're gonna take the world on
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone

I'm gonna be there all the way
I won't be missing one more day
I'm gonna be there all the way
I won't be missing one more day
