I'm leaving now
Won't see you again
I'm leaving now
Won't see you again

Put me in the ground
I don't wanna be here anymore
Put me in the ground
Put me in the ground
And I don't wanna be here anymore
Put me in the ground

I'm leaving now
Won't see you again
I'm leaving now
Won't see you again

And put me in the ground
And I don't wanna be here anymore
Put me in the ground
Put me in the ground
And I don't wanna be here anymore
Put me in the ground

This is goodbye
I'm leaving my best behind
And I know I tried
I'm leaving my best behind
This is goodbye
I'm leaving my best behind
And I know I tried
I'm leaving my best behind

Put me in the ground, put me in
Put me in the ground, put me in
Put me in the ground, put me in
Put me in the ground, put me in

I'm leaving now
Won't see you again
I'm leaving now
Won't see you again
I'm leaving now
Won't see you again
I'm leaving now
Won't see you again
