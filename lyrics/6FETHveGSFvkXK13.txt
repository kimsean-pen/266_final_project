Baby, hi [?]
Baby, hi [?]

When I was young
Always told the fallen would make me strong
Running nowhere
You've got to go out the other door
Oh I tried to
To discover
My voice is losing tone
I did love you
Told me not a million times in a row

The tone of your lips is calming me down
I'm scared of my own shadow
You come over and lay while I'm falling down
I've got myself all [?]

Oh, what a beautiful day has come
Oh, what a beautiful day has come
Oh, what a beautiful day but no one knew this, I was all alone

Baby, hi [?]
Baby, hi [?]

Took you too long
Told myself we'd always get along
Running nowhere
You've got to go out the other door
Oh I tried to
To discover
My voice is losing tone
When I was young
Always told the fallen would make me strong

The tone of your lips is calming me down
I'm scared of my own shadow
You come over and lay while I'm falling down
I've got myself all [?]

Oh, what a beautiful day has come
Oh, what a beautiful day has come
Oh, what a beautiful day but no one knew this, I was all alone
Oh, what a beautiful day has come
Oh, what a beautiful day has come
Oh, what a beautiful day but no one knew this, I was all alone

Baby, hi [?]
Baby, hi [?]
Baby, hi [?]
Baby, hi [?]

To Hawaii (Hi)
In Hawaii (Hi)
To Hawaii (Hi)
In Hawaii (Hi)

Oh, what a beautiful day has come
Oh, what a beautiful day has come
Oh, what a beautiful day but no one knew this, I was all alone
Oh, what a beautiful day has come
Oh, what a beautiful day has come
Oh, what a beautiful day but no one knew this, I was all alone
