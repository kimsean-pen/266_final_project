While you are away I'm waiting
I'm out of my mind you're out of town
You know I'm no stranger to frustration
I won't break I won't let you down

Cause I know right from wrong
And I know I can be strong
You know I won't let me let you down

I look back on my past, I'm dirty
I know that guy would always let you down
But while I am away don't worry
Just keep your faith in me and have no doubt

Cause I know right from wrong
And I know I can be strong
If there's no lying then there's no crying
Arrive in your own time stay patient
You know I won't let me let you down

(I'm waiting)
You know I won't let me let you down
(You know I won't let me, waiting)
You know I won't let me let you down
(You know I won't let me)

Won't let myself be led into temptation
It's you and me nobody else allowed
Well you know I'm no stranger to frustration
Just keep your faith in me and have no doubt

Cause I know right from wrong
And I know I can be strong
If there's no lying there's no crying
Arrive in your own time stay patient
You know I won't let me let you down

(I'm waiting)
You know I won't let me let you down
(You know I won't let me, I'm waiting)
You know I won't let me let you down
(You know I won't let me)
You know I won't let me let you down
You know I won't let me let you down
You know I won't let me let you down
