Why boasteth thyself, oh evil men
playing smart and being clever, oh no
I say, you're working inequity
to achieve vanity, yeah, if I sow I sow
but the goodness of Jah, Jah
I'doreth for Iver

If you are a big tree,
We are the small axe
sharpened to cut you down (we shall)
ready to cut you down, oh yeah

These are the words of my Master
keep on telling me
no weak heart shall prosper
oh no, they can't, eh

And whosoever diggeth a pit
shall fall in it, shall fall in it
Whosoever diggeth a pit
shall bury in it, shall bury in it

If you are a big tree,
We are the small axe
sharpened to cut you down
ready to cut you down

And whosoever diggeth a pit
shall fall in it, fall in it, eh
Whosoever diggeth a pit
shall bury in it, shall bury in it

If you are the big tree,
We have a small axe
ready to cut you down (we shall)
sharpened to cut you down
