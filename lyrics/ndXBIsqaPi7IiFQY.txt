I was sure, I was born and raised to be my own man
I was so sure; I was never going to need a helping hand
And she said, trust in your heart and there's no need to understand
Well just when I thought I had it planned out

Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you
Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you

I was driving too close to the edge and living dangerously
I felt strange a warm sensation rising up inside of me
Oh like a tidal wave came from nowhere swept me off my feet

Oh but somehow making me complete now

Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you
Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you
Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you
Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you

Once you've had a taste of it there's no going back
Once you've had a taste of it there's no going back
Once you've had a taste of it there's no going back
Once you've had a taste of it there's no going back

Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you
Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you
Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you
Whatever I do I'm under the influence of you
