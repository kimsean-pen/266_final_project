Well, your CD collection
Looks shiny and costly
How much did you pay for your bad Moto Guzzi?
And how much did you spend
On your black leather jacket?
Is it you or your parents in this income tax bracket?

Now, tickets to concerts
And drinking at clubs
Sometimes for music that you haven't even heard of
And how much did you pay for
Your rock 'n' roll T-shirt
That proves you were there, that you heard of them first?

Now, how do you afford your rock 'n' roll lifestyle?
How do you afford your rock 'n' roll lifestyle?
How do you afford your rock 'n' roll lifestyle?
Oh, tell me

Aw, yeah, all right
All right
Oh, yeah, all right, aw

How much did you pay
For the chunk of his guitar
The one he ruthlessly smashed at the end of the show?
And how much will he pay
For a brand-new guitar
One which he'll ruthlessly smash at the end of another show?
And how long will the workers
Keep building him new ones?
As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones
And how long will the workers
Keep building him new ones?
As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones

Aw, yeah, aw, yeah
Aw, yeah, all right, ha
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh, no

Aging black leather and hospital bills
And tatoo removal and dozens of pills
Your liver pays dearly now for youthful magic moments
But rock on completely with some brand-new components

Now, how do you afford your rock 'n' roll lifestyle?
How do you afford your rock 'n' roll lifestyle?
How do you afford your rock 'n' roll lifestyle?
All right, aw, yeah

So good, oh, baby

Excess ain't rebellion
You're drinkin' what they're selling now
Your self-destruction doesn't hurt them
Your chaos won't convert them
They're so happy to rebuild it
You'll never really kill it, aw, yeah
Excess ain't rebellion
You're drinkin' what they're selling, oh
Excess ain't rebellion, oh
You're drinkin', you're drinkin'
Aw, yeah, you're drinkin' what they selling
Aw
Yeah, all right
Aw
Yeah
All right
