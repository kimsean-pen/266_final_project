If a bird broke its beak
Would it's song be sad and weak?
Would it be known as just the same?
Or be a bird only in name

At a loss for words
Its beyond belief
You were known to me then
Like I hear most songs
Well the words they would rhyme
Just move along

Maybe there's a cause that's without a care
Maybe there's some truth that's without a fact
Then you came a long, drew some lines
The only thing I'm guilty of is killing time

And i regret
The flames on leaves
Erase the tower in Tennessee
Where we met
I lost my nerve
Tell me where it was now, we'd bear a child
In the cold with the wolves and a rat gone wild

When times were tight watch the dawning twilight
In the shame in between witness the sun salient scream

Maybe there's a cause that's without a care
Maybe there's some truth that's without a fact
Then you came a long, drew some lines
The only thing I'm guilty of is killing time

If a bird broke its beak
Would it's song be sad and weak?
Would it be known as just the same?
Or be a bird only in name

Then you came a long, drew some lines
The only thing I'm guilty of is killing time
