Now take me dancing
At the Disco
Where you buy your
Winniebago
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

When the light turns into darkness
Will he turn up to explain us?
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

Lend me a whole new world
All night
Feel life
When is there ever sense
To love
This world

In the whirlpool
We'll go deeper
In this world that's
Getting cheaper
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

I like dancing
At the disco
I want blisters
You're my leader
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

Oh I love this feeling
Feels like forever
Oh I love this feeling
Feels like real
Leather
