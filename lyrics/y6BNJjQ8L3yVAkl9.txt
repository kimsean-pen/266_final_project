Blistering Pree, all smiling and swollen
Makes babies to breathe with their hearts hanging open
All over the sheets as soft as beets in some brown dresser drawer
And with bees in her breath and the rest of her ringing
They'll sting through her chest with a force hard and beating
'Til wonderfully wet she will get
Until she's soaked inside her clothes
And there is no sorry to be sorry for
For roll around the floor some afternoon so sound and soft
It made her swallow all her sweat with every bit of breath she coughed
And when the day it came to pour
All her babies all across the bathroom floor
She will be swimming in them all forever more

Glow right into you, I will glow
Right into you I will glow
Right into you
And I let you down
Swollen and small is where you find me now
That silver stripping off my tongue you're tearing out
You'll never hear me talk
Glow right into you, I will glow
Right into you I will glow
Right into you

And I will be strong, strong enough
To shout above your voice that's blaring on
And your face that's falling out into the dust of what you want
I'll never hear you talk

Glow right into you, I will glow
Right into you I will glow
Right into you

And with my little fingers
I could make it all crumble
I could make it all over
Before you would even know
Glow
