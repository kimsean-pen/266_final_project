She wakes up, gets in the shower
Little girl, it's time for school
Remember, the advice from your mother
Little boys are fools

She wonders, she wonders
What it's like
To feel like, to feel like
To be in love
To kiss them, and have them
All the time
She stays up, and wonders
Every night

They're seventeen, she's now at the movies
With a boy, she met
Well it's over, [?]
But she's not, finished yet

She wonders, she wonders
What it's like
To kiss him, and hold him
And touch him right
To feel him, to feel him
Inside
Never remember
Mom's advice

She wonders, she wonders
What it's like
To touch him, and kiss him
And hold him tight
To feel him, to feel him
Inside
Stay up, to make love
Every night
She wonders, she wonders
What it's like
To feel like, to feel like
They did back then
Never remember
Mom's advice
