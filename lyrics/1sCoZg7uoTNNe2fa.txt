I awake in the morning
My imagination runs away
I wonder what the people say
Inside their minds

Visions of the future come
Sometimes it gets me down
I wonder why I'm such a clown
I don't think I'll stay

Wild young lovers
Looking for a place to stay
One day we'll run away
Inside our minds

Visions of the future come
Sometimes it gets me down
I wonder why I'm such a clown
I don't think I'll stay
