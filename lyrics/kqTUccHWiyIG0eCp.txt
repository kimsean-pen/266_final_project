All my leaves are fallen
Still I'm heading down this road
Kind of wish it wasn't such a long, long way to go
So I keep on calling, calling out to those who know
Where the leaves aren't falling
I'm heading out to California
'Cause we can get high
We can get higher, we can get louder
We can get louder, we can get louder

So young and we're trees and we wanna go up
Till we go so high we'll never come down
You won't know, you won't know
Till you find your California tree
So young and we're trees and we wanna go up
Till we just let go and we feel it out
You won't know, you won't know
Till you find your California tree

Ten down the highway, where the stars are white as snow
You pull me out of somewhere, somewhere I was far below
I haven't even noticed if the time is right to go
Where it is I'm going, just get me close to windy road
'Cause we can get high
We can get higher, we can get louder
We can get louder, we can get louder

So young and we're trees and we wanna go up
Till we go so high we'll never come down
You won't know, you won't know
Till you find your California tree
So young and we're trees and we wanna go up
Till we just let go and we feel it out
You won't know, you won't know
Till you find your California tree

Sometimes you never know
When the time goes out you let it flow
These days you never know
Only keep the good times for you

So young and we're trees and we wanna go up
Till we go so high we'll never come down
You won't know, you won't know
Till you find your California tree
So young and we're trees and we wanna go up
Till we just let go and we feel it out
You won't know, you won't know
Till you find your California tree
