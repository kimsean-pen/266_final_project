Good looks never hurt no one
Yet they fail to
Turn me on
If you'd like a way with me
Then a way with words
Is the key
My, my
The way you write, write
Blows my mind, mind
Way you write
What a brilliant line
Can we spend the night?
Send me just a phrase or two
No one says things quite
Quite like you
I just cannot help but smile
Got me so intrigued
By your mind
My, my
The way you write, write
Blows my mind, mind
Way you write
What a brilliant line
Can we spend the night?
