I let you in my brain
I used to doubt, now I believe
I let you ease my pain
Using your black magic on me (me)

I don't know how you do what you do
But you do it so good to me
My favorite pill when I'm getting so blue
Your taste is all I need

Baby, you're my cocaine, I can't stop sniffing
You move so good, got my heart totally tripping
The moment I get you in my veins
I'm taking over the world

I let you in my brain
I used to doubt, now I believe
I let you ease my pain
Using your black magic on me
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Using your black magic on me
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Using your black magic on me

You make it feel so damn good to be bad
You're the best I ever had
You're cold-blooded and I love it, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby you're my ocean, I can't stop swimming
The salt of your waves, and I can't stop sipping
The moment that I get you all alone (alone)

I let you in my brain
I used to doubt, now I believe
I let you ease my pain
Using your black magic on me
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Using your black magic on me
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Using your black magic on me

When I was young (uh uh uh uh) my father warned me
About girls like you (uh uh uh uh)
About girls like you (ah ha)
When my heart is numb (uh uh uh uh) and I'm feeling lonely
I let you through (uh uh uh uh)
And you fixed my blues up

I let you in my brain
I used to doubt, now I believe
I let you ease my pain
Using your black magic on me
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Using your black magic on me
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Using your black magic on me

I love it, baby
