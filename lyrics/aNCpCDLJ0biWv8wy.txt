I am the bringer of war
Armed with my hatred and more
And I'm here to set things right
I am the breaker of chains
The only chance that remains
And I'm gonna start a fire
I'm gonna light up the world
Then I'm gonna blacken the skies
Your shelter will burn to the ground
The slaughter will dehumanize

Draw a line painted with blood in the sand
The only war we could never lose is at hand
Cast the stones, they will all be thrown to the sky
Oh, cast them all and deliverance you will find, yeah

I'm here to set you alight
Now go ahead and run for your life
Reprisal will be mine
Beg for the end if you please
But go ahead and get on your knees
Your master, your design
I'll poison the sheltering sky
Strangle this treacherous world
Search for no light, it is gone
The ending, the ruin has come

Draw a line painted with blood in the sand
The only war we could never lose is at hand
Cast the stones, they will all be thrown to the sky
Oh, cast them all and deliverance you will find, yeah

Draw a line painted with blood in the sand
The only war we could never lose is at hand
Cast the stones, they will all be thrown to the sky
Oh, cast them all and deliverance you will find, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
