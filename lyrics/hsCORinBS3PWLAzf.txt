Rain and thunder, fire and wind
Come with me, I leave with the tide
I wrap my cloak closer 'round my shoulders
To keep me warm from the raging storm

The spirits are here to guide my journey
Over the edge of the world
A thousand wounds cry in my soul
Love and pain, a bleeding heart

Where the runes still speak
I'm coming home
Where the runes still speak

Alone I stand on this stony coast
Winds of spring whisper through the trees
The grey horizon gives me life again
Ice, and stone, the voices of the Gods

No woman can show me where the fire burns
No preacher can tell me who I am
My blood is calling me from Asaland
I'm on my way home in the end

Where the runes still speak
I'm coming home
Where the runes still speak

A homeward son will claim his heritage
Walk the soil of this earth
The pen will be his mighty sword
And the truth his defense

I've travelled roads that lead to wonder
I've seen cities rise and fall
The burden, the cross of a pilgrim
I bear no more, the son is coming home

Where the runes still speak
Son coming home
Where the runes still speak

You closed the door, but I won't give in
Somewhere my new life will begin
Countless treasures I shared with you
The only one left is my solitude

Where the runes still speak
I'm coming home
Where the runes still speak
Son coming home
Where the runes still speak
Son coming home
Where the runes still speak
I'm coming home
Where the runes still speak
