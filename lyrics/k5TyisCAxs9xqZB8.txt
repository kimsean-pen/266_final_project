Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
(Your lovin' is)
(Your lovin' is)

Well you know I'm not religious but
Your lovin' is bible
You can teach me how to speak your language
Make me your disciple

Laughing in your car, you're out shining like the stars
Meet me at the moon 'cause we like the altitude
Feel the heat when your around
Got the seats laying down
I love the way you move
When it's just me and you

Well you know I'm not religious, but
Your lovin' is bible
(Your lovin' is)
We could paint our love all over town
Watch it go viral
(Your lovin' is)
Making me feel like I could go crazy
You are the only one who can save me (hey)
I know you know you got me going crazy, but
Your lovin' is bible, your lovin' is bible (hey)

Take me to your holy places
Treat you like an idol
Confessing all my secrets to you
With no denial

So roll the windows down
It's so hot when you're around
I love the way you move
When it's just me and you

Well I know you're not religious, but
This lovin' is bible
(You're loving' is)
We could paint our love all over town
Watch it go viral
(You're loving' is)
Making me feel like I could go crazy
You are the only one who can save me (hey)
I know you know you got me going crazy, but
Your lovin' is bible, your lovin' is bible (hey)

Could you take me there
'Cause you know I've gotta have you
'Cause you know I've gotta have you
Would you take me there
'Cause you know I've gotta have you
'Cause you know I've gotta have you

Ooh ooh ooh ooh (hey)

You're making me feel like I could go crazy
You are the only one who can save me (hey)
I know you know you got me going crazy, but
Your lovin' is bible, your lovin' is bible
(Your loving' is) (hey)
Well you know I'm not religious, but
Your lovin' is bible, your lovin' is bible
(Your loving' is bible)
We could paint our love all over town
Watch it go viral, your lovin' is bible (hey)
