light your heart up
light your heart, yeah
light your heart up

when you get down

we're gonna, sing, sing, sing
we got this fire in us
that runs deeper than blood
so if you ever doubt
you should know by now

whatever stars you're looking at tonight
on top of the world or alone inside
i'll always be there for you
i'll always be there for you
whatever place no matter where you are
even when life tries to take your spark
nothing i wouldn't do
to light your heart
for you, for you
i'll light your heart
for you, for you
i'll light your heart

on the wire just holding on
i'll be the one when the walk is long
till the dark, yeah
till the dark falls

till the dark, yeah
till the dark falls
fight for ya when you don't believe
storm the kingdom and take the keys
even when you can't see i'll light your heart

whatever stars you're looking at tonight
on top of the world or alone inside
i'll always be there for you
i'll always be there for you
whatever place no matter where you are
