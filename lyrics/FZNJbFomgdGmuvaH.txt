So you ask for my opinion
Well, what is there to say
To be honest and just foolish
Won't make you wanna stay

You've got to go on and get moving
And I can't do that for you
Got so many plans
And so much you wanna do

Love is tough
Time is rough
Love is tough
Time is rough
On me

Well, I see you've got your bible
Your delusion imagery
Well, I don't need your eternity
Or your meaning to feel free

I just live because I love to
And that's enough, you see
So don't come preach about morality
That's just human sense to me

Love is tough
Time is rough
Love is tough
Time is rough

On me
On me
On me

And it's one life and it's this life and it's beautiful
And it's one life and it's this life and it's beautiful
And it's one life and it's this life and it's beautiful
And it's one life and it's this life
And it's beau, beau, beau, beautiful

Love is tough
Time is rough
On me
