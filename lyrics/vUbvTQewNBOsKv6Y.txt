When you're on your own
Spread out on the map
Dead
The highway's endless drone
Something familiar
And how we love the seasons that hide in our stomachs
That howl and howl and howl as if Dropped from the great height
And I thought the hours that lie in the kitchen

They drag him, drag him, drag into black night
Dropped from the great height
It was strange
Constant blue
And the same ghost every night

I go walking
Just to find
My own breath my own breath through the path
I go walking
Just to find
My own breath my own breath through the path
Dropped from the great height
It was strange

Constant blue
And the same ghost every night
It was strange
Constant blue
And the same ghost every night
I go walking
Just to find
My own breath, my own breath through the path
I go walking

We are raised up very high
We are raised up very high
My own breath
