Sometimes you can work it out, sometimes you can't
Sometimes you're forced to watch everything fall apart
It's outta your hands

Sometimes leaving is easy, sometimes it ain't
Sometimes it hurts to know the loving you had
Is slowly fading away

You can say whatever you like as long as we just say goodbye
Blame it on me, say it's my fault
Say that I left you outside in the cold with a broken heart
I really don't care, I ain't crying no more
Say I'm a liar, a cheater, say anything that you want as long as it's over

I ain't a quitter, I just ain't the type
I tried to see you through
I tried to make it to the finishing line

You thought it was meant to be, I admit so did I
Every once in a while you think you figured it out
Sometimes you're not right

You can say whatever you like as long as we just say goodbye
Blame it on me, say it's my fault
Say that I left you outside in the cold with a broken heart
I really don't care, I ain't crying no more
Say I'm a liar, a cheater, say anything that you want as long as it's over

Yes, I love you but I really got to lose you
Freedom's where I wanna be
Yes, I'll probably always love you but I'm moving
I gotta do this for me

Blame it on me, say it's my fault
Say that I left you outside in the cold with a broken heart
I really don't care, I ain't crying no more
Say I'm a liar, a cheater, say anything that you want
Blame it on me, say it's my fault
Say that I left you outside in the cold with a broken heart
I really don't care, I ain't crying no more
Say I'm a liar, a cheater, say anything that you want as long as it's over
