You look so cool, standing there
With your baggy jeans and silky hair
We can live for nothing baby I don't care
Lose me like the ocean, feel the motion

I'll be the sea honey
Always, always
And you'll be the tide
I'll be the sea honey
Always, always
And you'll be the tide

I'll float with you, through the clouds
Take me on your dream, flow through my bloodstream
Honey, oh this time, I'll take the plunge
Lose me like the ocean, feel the motion

I'll be the sea honey
Always, always
And you'll be the tide
I'll be the sea honey
Always, always
And you'll be the tide

You look so cool, standing there
With your baggy jeans and silky hair
We can live for nothing baby I don't care
Lose me like the ocean, feel the motion

I'll be the sea honey
Always, always
And you'll be the tide
I'll be the sea honey
Always, always
And you'll be the tide

I'll be the sea, be, I'll be the sea
And you'll be the tide, you'll be the tide
I'll be the sea, be, I'll be the sea
And you'll be the tide, you'll be the tide
