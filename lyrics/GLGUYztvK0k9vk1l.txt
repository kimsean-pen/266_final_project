Lately I've been afraid of myself
The closer that I get to rain
The more I feel at home, the further I'm away
And all that I feel is pain

Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out the chain
Crimson tears falling and my shirt is blood-stained
And the devil's forever in my veins
And the devil's forever in my veins

The morning's across I've been when I wake
Am I asleep? Have I broken my faith?
Down on my knees, can you hear me when I pray?
Or am I a little too late?

Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out the chain
Crimson tears falling and my shirt is blood-stained
And the devil's forever in my veins
And the devil's forever in my veins

Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out the chain
Crimson tears falling and my shirt is blood-stained
And the devil's forever in my veins
And the devil's forever in my veins
