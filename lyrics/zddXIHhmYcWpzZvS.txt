The body breaks
And the body is fine
I'm open to yours
And i'm open to mine

The body aches
And that ache takes it time
But you'll get over yours
And i'll get over mine

And the sun will shine
And the moon will rise up

The body calls
Yeah, the body, it calls out
It whispers at first
But it ends with a shout

The body burns
Yeah, the body burns strong
Until mine is with yours
Then mine will burn on

My flash sings out
It sings, "come pour me out"

The body sways
Like the wind on a swing
A bridge through a hoop
Or a lake through a ring

The body stays
And then the body moves on
And i'd really rather not dwell on
When yours will be gone

But within the dark
There is a shine
One tiny spark
That's yours and mine
