Walls are closing in on me
Hear the clock ticking
But time is standing still for me
Used, or did you say abused?
Makes no difference to me
Can we agree to disagree?

I would rather tune out
Than open up my mind
To be placed in your little faction
No, pick another time
Choose another day
And a place if it's another interaction

Roughed up, rundown
Gave in to giving up
You can take it out on me
'Cause I don't give a fuck

Hey! Did I ever ask you
To step on my toes?
Face the knuckleduster
And you'll end up six feet under
Thou shalt not kill is what they say
But I swear we'll see the day
To bring you down
And you will end up six feet under
