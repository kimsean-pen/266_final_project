Too much too soon
Or is that simply my excuse?

Dear lord, I must give this confession
I only hope he pays attention
For far too long I played the victim
Hoping someone would pay attention

Too much too soon
Or is that simply my excuse?
Too much too soon
For everything I did to you

Too much too soon
Or is that simply my excuse?
Too much too soon
For everything I did to you

All of my mistakes
There's nothing I can do to fix it now
I just wish you could understand

I'm sorry that I ever hurt you
And that your trust in me was worthless
And now I know what the fucking truth is
I want your heart but I don't deserve it

Too much too soon
Or is that simply my excuse?
Too much too soon
Or is that simply my excuse?

Too much too soon
Or is that simply my excuse?
For everything I did to you
