Hello, hello
You put love in my head
I know, I know It's made of lead
Hello, hello
Science came, a kingdom reigned
Below, below my Charlemagne
And the river always flows, so if you go I will know
by the way, my Charlemange
Hello, hello
my eyes, dryed, hide, cried, died
beside the snow in the winter
Hello, hello
The doctors knew; prescribe me you
below, below the amber sky
And the river always flows, so if you go I will know
by the way, my Charlemange
And the river always flows tears of gold
left me cold do you feel the same my Charlemange?
My Charlemange, my Charlemange
My Charlemange, my Charlemange
don't go
if only I could show you
don't go
if only I could show you
don't go
if only I could show you
don't go
if only I could show you
And the river always flows
so if you go, I will know
by the way, my Charlemange.
And the river always flows tears of gold
left me cold do you feel the same my Charlemange?
Charlemange
