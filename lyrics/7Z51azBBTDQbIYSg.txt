I walked around the plaza with my shoes off
I ran into a boy that i grew up with
Said 'hey don't i know you from somewhere?'
My feet got caught in the escalator
Skin got ripped off my body
My bones got shredded to nothing
And even though you're talking you're still nameless
And even though you live here you still praise it
You gotta keep going keep racing
The car was caught out on the train tracks
Once more believe it
You know i didn't listen the last time but will you repeat it?
I'm not without my reasons
Ambulance at peak hour? keep dreaming
Rejection of a movement? it's in season
Your child will deem you worthless you space taker
Our love is never frozen it's just lazy
Our house is never homely it just sits there
But everybody's good to someone
He's at the bottom of the lake again
Just get him out and see if he's got his reason
Or if he still believes it
You'll never know beyond your self interest
You'll never know above so quit believing
It's a good time if you let it
