On my feet again
Down the street to look for you
and on this summer night
Everything's going to be alright
and it feels like I might start to live my life
You know it's been a while since I had a good long
smile
and I feel good tonight
Everything's going to be alright

and it feels like I might start to live my life

I hear that music playing
I wanna make you hear it
I've never been in love with anyone like you before
and that song i hear, ohhhhhh, was made for you and me
and disco dancing
and when I'm dreaming with you
Wish you could hear what I do
I've never known the rainbow glows the way I look at
you
I feel that I do, know the way that it would feel
Like disco dancing

I never heard the night, like I do when i'm with you
When you take my hand down your street through a tunnel
of trees
and it feels like their is nothing left to see
Something as my heart while I'm sailing through the
dark
and every memory of my dream life has come back to me

and it feels like their is nothing left to see

I hear that music playing
I wanna make you hear it
I've never been in love with anyone like you before
and that song i hear, ohhhhhh, was made for you and me
and disco dancing
and when I'm dreaming with you
Wish you could hear what I do
I've never known the rainbow glowsthe way I look at
you
I feel that I do, know the way that it would feel
Like disco dancing

I hear that music playing
