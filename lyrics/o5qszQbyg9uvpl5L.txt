The neighborhood that I live in
I've always seen as home
At certain times of the evening
It's like a no-go zone

Got cash in my pocket to last the weekend
And I've got features I quite like and don't mind keeping

But still I walk the
Side streets home
Even when I'm on my own
If I let myself believe all the bad press and horror stories
I wouldn't set a foot outside

You say I live in a bubble
I find a bubble's best
At a faint whiff of trouble
Just turn and head due west

Quite light on my feet if I ever need be
As I zip down the street no one ever sees me

That's why I walk the
Side streets home
Even when I'm on my own
If I let myself believe all the bad press and horror stories
I wouldn't set a foot outside

I'm tempting fate (I know, tell me about it)
So nonchalant (I know, and I don't doubt it)
I'll probably get it tomorrow

'Til then I'll walk the
Side streets home
Even when I'm on my own
If I let myself believe...

(Side streets home...)
(On my own...)

Believe...
