Well, you can bite the bullet
Breath in, breath out
Or be a victim all your life

Go window shopping
Save your money
Riches to rags overnight
It's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life

You can join the family business
Serve behind the counter
Even have your name above the door

Join the order
Learn the handshake
You won't need protection anymore
It's a wonderful life

When you think it's over
You can look through your photos
Taken for prosperity and you'll find

Have an affair, get a new interest
Go into debt, go on the sick lists
Study at your leisure in your home

Get into shape, try to lose weight
Regain your confidence, control you fate
Victim of circumstance, look on the bright side
It's a wonderful life

It's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life
