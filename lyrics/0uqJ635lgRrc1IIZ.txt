Get up again
Turn it on again
Stare and try to find some meaning
Let the day begin
But you feel that urge in your mind
You stumble in, still holding in
You move like an electric zombie
Barely noticing as your life keeps passing you by

Oh I still can remember a time when it wasn't like this
Before the world became enslaved
Can we all go back to the time when we were not like this
Can we even be saved?

In another time when we weren't so blind
When the world was more than what we see online
When we actually lived instead of watching life
In another time, in another time

So it's 3 am
Turn it on again
You never seen the stuff completely
Keep checking in
On the "friends" that you're left behind
Always jumping in
Any argument
Seems everybody here knows everything
You know you'll never win but you're certainly loosing your mind

Oh I still can remember a time when it wasn't like this
Before the world became enslaved
Can we all go back to the time when we were not like this
Can we even be saved?

In another time when we weren't so blind
When the world was more than what we see online
When we actually lived instead of watching life
In another time, in another time

Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again

Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again

In another time when we weren't so blind
When the world was more than what we see online
When we actually lived instead of watching life
In another time, in another time

In another time will we still be blind?
Because there's so much more than what we see online
When we actually lived instead of watching life
In another time, in another time

Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
