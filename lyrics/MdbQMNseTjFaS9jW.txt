Yes, I'm too cocky
My bitch broke up with me, it shocked me
They say you're poppin' shit, yeah I'm paparazzi
"YG, how you like your bitches?" Hibachi
I like a bitch that let me talk shit to her
'Cause she know I'm her everything, nigga plus more
I'm ego trippin' and you a fuckboy
Fuck a plug, my face on Mount Rushmore
'Cause look at everything I did
There ain't a "I" in team, my nigga I did
The homies tell me go hard, nigga I'm in
Don't let these niggas take the spot, shit I wear this from the south
Came out the womb, I was big headed
Now I'm big breaded, little to the game, big winnin'
Get cheddar, YG 4Hunnid, I'm good at whatever
Anything he can do, I can do better

Bam-bam, fuck it up, from the back, check it up

Nike check, bitch, run it up

Rich nigga, I'm not a snitch nigga
I know my worth, I'm not a bitch nigga
Slick nigga, get the panties off quick
Give her the dick like some ranch, then I dip
