The streets outside were stained
At the stonewall on June 28th
Blood runs cold into the gutters
And into the drain

There's a fear you can't define
There's no peace and there's no crime
In living this way
So add a bead to your rosary
And say a prayer
You've got to suffer me

Suffer me
You got to let me be
And keep me outta your fantasy
Can you give me that one luxury
Yeah yeah yeah

As they walked, they locked their stride
And the night sticks swung right by their side
They jeered and they muttered
Yet to be defied

By the time the dawn had broke
The city coughed and slowly woke
And there was one less boot
Pressing down on one less throat
