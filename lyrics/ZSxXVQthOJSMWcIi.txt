The neck, then the chain
My head is hung in shame
The neck, then the chain
My head is hung in shame

I thought, as you went cold
That you would carry on
But now that I am gone
What else has been withdrawn

You used to be like my twin
And all that's been
Was it all for nothing

Are you strong you're with him
The one that's placed you, above us all

I think our love, I let it pass
It feels like fire, but it won't last

What is it coming to
I am alone to go on
You have lost
No one has won
