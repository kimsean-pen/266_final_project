And then I wished you away
I lost those memories
Of the days we weren't
Forsaken, why don't we
Just relax our eyes
And fall into a dream?
Let it take my mind
Where owls know my name

And it gets colder every day
And it gets colder every day

Lost in eternity's grasp
Withdrawing further from what we have known
This mentality that we built
It's breaking down

Still running away from it, you're still dreaming
Still hoping that there's something that may be worth seeking
You've wasted all that you have been given
Still hoping to find a way to make life worth living

Lost in eternity's grasp
We'll find no way to weather the storm
This mentality that we built
It's breaking down

All the same
Every path you take
You remain
Trapped within your shame

Go away, far away
Separate, from the shame
Go away, far away
Separate, from the shame

Lost in eternity's grasp
Withdrawing further from what we have known
This mentality that we built
It's breaking down

I've brought myself to this place
Where only owls would know me
This reality that I've built
Is an empty space
