Cerise, release and so much more
With perfect needle, hits the floor
I will be breathing will you?
Velvet warms all over here
Velvet warms all over here
Lay down in painless falling now

And it hurts too much to be where you are
Hurts too much to be where you are
I've got the perfect needle
I've got the perfect needle
For you

Surrender down comes everything
Breathes no more and falls to sleep
Blind and helpless sick and dead

Treasure waits complete and there
With scattered needles everywhere
Thorn at the end of every road
Thorn at the end of every road
