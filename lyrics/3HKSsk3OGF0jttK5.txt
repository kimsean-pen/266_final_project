Jackson Joe
Jumpin' Jive
Jumpin' With Symphony Sid

Jumpin' with my boss Sid in the city
Jumpin' with my boss Sid in the city
Mr. President of that DJ committee
We're gonna be up all night gettin' ready
We want you to spin the sounds from the city
Far down in the land that's real real pretty

Let everything go real crazy over jazz
Make everything go real crazy over jazz
Let everything cool for me and my baby
I don't wanna think we're listening too lazy
It's gotta be Pressburg cheering all the Basie
It's gotta get it all set right clear on the eighty
Let it roll
Let it roll
