It's happening soon, it's happening soon
It's scent has been blowing in my direction
To me it is new, to me it is new
And it's not gonna change for anybody

And it's gonna be our last memory
And it's led me on and on to you

It's gotta be here, it's gotta be there
It's gotta be now or I'll lose forever
To me it is strange, this feeling is strange
But it's not gonna change for anybody

And it's gonna be our last memory
And it's led me on and on to you

Accuse me
Trust me, I never knew
That you were the one
You were the one

And it's gonna be our last memory
And it's led me on and on to you
And it's gonna be our last memory
And it's led me on and on to you
