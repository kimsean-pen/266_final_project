Willing and able to run
I am willing and able
I'm able to come

I am willing and able to run
I am willing and able
I'm able to come

And if I wait for you now
Would you come? Would you run?
Would you bring it back around?
Oh baby, how?

And if I wait for you now
Would you come? Would you run?
Would you bring it back around?
Oh baby, how?

Willing and able to run
I am willing and able
I'm able to come

If it all went away, nothin' left to say
Oh, and you fight it all when you lay down
At the hand of your God, oh, could you see the light?
Oh, my prince can't you see what's been found?

Willing and able to run
Willing and able to come
Willing and able to run
I'm willing, I am willing, willing, willing

Willing and able to run
I am willing and able
I'm able to come

I am willing and able to run
I am willing and able
I'm able to come

And if I wait for you now
Would you come? Would you run?
Would you bring it back around?
Don't baby, how?

If I wait for you now
Would you come? Would you run?
Would you bring it back around?
No baby, how?

Willing and able to run
I am willing and able
I'm able to come

I am willing and able to run
I am willing and able
I'm able to come
