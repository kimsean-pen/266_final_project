When trouble is in my way
I can't tell the night from day
I'm tossed from side to side
Like a ship on a raging tide
I don't worry and I don't fret
God has never failed me yet
Troubles comin' from time to time
But that's all right, I'm not the worrying kind

Because I, I've got confidence,
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me

I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me

Job was sick oh so long
'Til the flesh fell from his bones
His wife, his cattle and children,
Everything that he had was gone
But Job, in his despair,
He knew that God still cared
Sleepless days and sleepless nights
Job said, honey, that's all right

Because I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me

I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me

Some folks wonder how I smile
Even though I'm going through trials
How can I have a song
When everything is goin' wrong
I don't worry and I don't fret
God has never failed me yet
Trouble's comin' from time to time
But that's all right, I'm not the worryin' kind

Because I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me

Because I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me

I've got confidense
I've got confidense
I know He's gonna fix it for me

I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me

I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me

I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me

I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me

I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me
Oou yaa oou oou
