I saw you on Sunday, Monday
Hanging with your man again
You came back on a Tuesday
With that cold a' look ashamed

Oh I could love you better
Better than you once knew
If you're cheating, cheat on yeah
'cause cheating's just a thing you do
It's just a thing you do

I saw you on Friday, Saturday
Tearing up another heart
You came home a' crying
Why you take it all so hard?

You know I love you better
Better than you once knew
If you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
But I would never cheat on you

Yeah, I could love you, better
Better than you once knew
But if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
'Cause cheating's just the thing you do
It's just a thing you do

Ohhh
I've been told you baby
You done some things so bad to me ahh
I know

You are the one who's creeping
You are the one who's cheating
But if you're heart is beating
Bring it on, bring it to me.

You are the one who's creeping
You are the one who's cheating
But if you're heart is beating
Bring it on, bring it to me.

I could love you, better
Better than you once knew
If you're cheating, cheat on
But I would never cheat on you, no.
I could love you, better
Better than you once knew
If you're cheating, cheat on
'Cause cheating's just a thing you do.
