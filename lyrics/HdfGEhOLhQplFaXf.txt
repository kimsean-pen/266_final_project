Face to face
so far apart

Looking for the words
but they just won't start.
How can I say that I feel the same? Don't tell me:

One
two
three
this is how it starts.
Listen for the sound of the breaking hearts.
I stand in the rain until I hear you say: come back again!

Face to face we talk
like children we walk away

Like lovers we start again - face to face.
Face to face we talk
like children we walk away

Like lovers we start again - face to face.

Some way
some how I believe

We could make it happen
but it's turning me
Around and around and around again. Don't tell me:
One
two
three
this is how it start's. . . .
Face to face we talk
like children we walk away
. . .
Face to face we talk
like children we walk away
. . .
Children - face to face - and children - face to face -
And children - and children - face to face.
