There's nothing I want
But money in time
Million dollar bills
In a tick tick tick tick

There's nothing more cruel
Than only nine lives
A limit in spite
Will do the trick trick trick trick

We can leave the house, lead the party
Let the people know
Go drown the colors of our minds
And watch the cars go

There's nothing as fun
As coming untied
And running with the kids
In the park park park park

There's nothing that's hurt
Like letting you go
It's like a bird eyes
In the dark dark dark dark

We can leave the house, lead the party
Let the people know
Go drown the colors of our minds
And watch the cars go

It's not about just being out with all our people
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free flow

And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
