Everybody in love,
Go on put your hands up,
Everybody in love,
Go on put your hands up,
Everybody in love,
Go on put your hands up,
If you're in love,
Put your hands up,

You know you need someone,
When the needs so strong,
When they're gone you don't know how to go on,
So the whole world is stuck in a moment,
Standing still until they come back,
You accept that they've,
Got things to do,
But sometimes in the end
Theres nothing left for you,
If hurt is missing your baby,

I've done too much of it lately,

Every minutes like an hour,
Every hours like a day,
Every day lasts forever,
But what else am I gonna do,
I'd wait forever and a day for you,
I wait up, wait up,
I can't eat, I can't sleep,
What else could it be?
Missing you so deep,
Long as I'm where you're going to,
I'd wait forever and a day for you,

I wait up, wait up for you,

Oh, I wait up, wait up for you
And even when we mad,
And say were through,
Deep inside you feel the same way I do,
Might as well turn around and just end this,
'Cause it's harder trying to stay mad,
I could tell you that you can't stay here,

Knowing just as soon as you disappear,
That I'll be missing you baby,

Soon as you get up and you walk away,
Every minutes like an hour,
Every hours like a day,
Every day lasts forever,
But what else am I gonna do,
I'd wait forever and a day for you,
I wait up, wait up,
I can't eat, I can't sleep,
What else could it be?

Missing you so deep,
Long as I'm where you're going to,
I'd wait forever and a day for you,

I wait up, wait up for you,
Everybody in love,
Go on put your hands up,
Everybody in love,
Go on put your hands up,

Everybody in love,
Go on put your hands up,
If you're in love,
Put your hands up, (put your hands up.)

Everybody in love,
Go on put your hands up,
Everybody in love,

Go on put your hands up,
Everybody in love,
Go on put your hands up,
If you're in love,
Put your hands up,(put your hands up.)

Every minutes like an hour,
Every hours like a day,
Every day lasts forever,
But what else am I gonna do,(gonna do,)
I'd wait forever and a day for you,(for you,)
I wait up, wait up,(wait up,)
I can't eat, I can't sleep, what else could it be, (no)
Missing you so deep,
Long as I'm where you're going to,
I'd wait forever and a day for you,
I wait up, wait up for you,
