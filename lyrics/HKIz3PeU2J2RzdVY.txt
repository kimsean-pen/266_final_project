Every moment of your life laid out around you...
... like a city!
Streets full of buildings made of days.
The day you were born, the day you die, the day you fall in love, the day that love ends.
The whole city built from triumphant, heartbreak and boredom and laughter and cutting your toe nails.
It's the best place you will ever be.
What... in the end... are any of us looking for?
We're looking for someone.
Why me?
Why you what?
I never know why.
I only know... who.
I don't know.
You could come with me.
What you are standing in... is a technological marvel.
This is the gateway to everything that ever was... or ever can be.
Between here and my office, before the kettle boils...
All of time and space. Everything that ever happened or ever will.
... is everything that ever happened or ever will.
You can run away all you like and still be home in time for tea, so what do you say?
Yes.
Fantastic!
You are her hero.
I'm not a hero.
I'm not a hero.
You stop bad things happening every minute of every day. That sounds... pretty heroic to me.
You don't call the helpline because you ARE the helpline.
I've come to help, I'm the Doctor.
I'm the Doctor.
To the man without a home...
The last of the Time Lords.
The lonely god.
The Doctor, he. helps people.
He has saved your lives so many times and you never even knew he was there.
He never stops. He never stays. He never asks to be thanked.
Good is good in the final hour, in the deepest pit without hope, without witness, without reward.
Because that's how I see the universe.
He has walked this universe for centuries untold. He's seen stars fall to dust.
Do you know who that leaves? ME!
Just ME.
He's... like a fire.
Look around you. Nothing but death and destruction.
Have you ever killed anyone?
Yes.
I've taken lives.
I'd no choice.
Playing with so many people's lives, you must as well be a god.
You must've been like GOD.
You want to be forgiven?
Don't we all?
Doctor, the word for healer and wise man throughout the universe.
Why is it up to you to save us? That's... quite a god complex you have there.
Tell me... Am I a good man?
You... are... a... good... Dalek.
There's no such thing as the Doctor!
I'm just a bloke in a box... telling stories!
Always moving on because you dare not look back.
The man who keeps running, never looking back because he dare not out to shame.
Winning? Is that what you think it's about?
I'm not trying to win.
I do what I do because it's right!
I've been running, faster than I ever run, and I've been running my whole life.
Now it's time for me to stop.
And because sometimes, I'm not some old Time Lord who ran away.
I'm the Doctor.
Ok. Just promise me one thing, yeah?
Just promise you won't get me killed.
I want you to back by my side because it is the safest place in the world.
This is what I get. My reward.
Your version of good is not absolute. It's very arrogant, sentimental.
You're so sentimental, Doctor.
Who I am... is where I stand. Where I stand...
It must end.
Turn me off.
I lived too long.
We're all stories in the end.
It was the best.
... is where I fall.
Without hope, without witness, without reward.
Doctor... let it go. Time enough.
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.
I will always remember when the Doctor was me.
When the Doctor... was... me.
Pity...
No stars...
I hope there'd be stars.
Time, and relative dimension... in... space.
It means LIFE.
