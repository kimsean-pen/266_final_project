Every single day I fight another war
Every single night I feel more powerful
Well this is what it takes to live my way
So the world will take me as I am

Don't underestimate me
Make me feel like I ain't okay
Your bullshit ain't fooling me
One man false economy
Underappreciated
Make me feel like I ain't okay
Your high praise ain't feeding me
One girl false autonomy

Well this is what it takes to live my way
So the world will take me as I–

Overcomplicating
Makes me feel like I ain't okay
You're waiting for me to fall
You're so forgettable
From how I understand it
Everybody thinks it's okay (is it okay?)
To keep up the status quo
Well, that ain't no more

So this is the last time that I give you anymore
(I don't think so)

Every single day I fight another war
Every single night I feel more powerful
Every single day I fight another war
Every single night I feel more powerful
So this is what it takes to live my way
So the world will take me as I am

You're trying to conversate
When I don't want to hear you talking
Your bullshit ain't fooling me
One man false economy
Underappreciated
Make me feel like I'm okay
Your high praise ain't feeding me
And that ain't no more

So this is the last time I give you anymore
(3, 2, 1)

Every single day I fight another war
Every single night I feel more powerful
Every single day I fight another war
Every single night I feel more powerful
So this is what it takes to live my way
So the world will take me as I am

You think you're touching me
With your clichés I've heard before
You wanna turn back the time
Make it rewind
I wanna be myself and I-
Don't wanna sacrifice my love
So let it go

Every single day I fight another war
Every single night I feel more powerful
So this is what it takes to live my way
So the world will take me as I am
So this is what it takes to live my way
So the world will take me as I am
