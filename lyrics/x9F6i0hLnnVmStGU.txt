Somewhere hiding underneath
Kickin' off covers while you sleep
Soon you're gonna leave
So leave us one more weekend

You've got all the friends you need
Bad tattoos and worse ideas
You feel alive
Do you feel alive?

You'll go off, you'll forget
You'll grow out of hanging from the edges
Breaking off the past

You'll know when to move up
You'll know when to take all the right chances
Never looking back

Somewhere hiding underneath
Runnin' around these empty streets
Do you think you're better off dead
Better off dead, better alive than here?

You've got all the friends you need
Bad tattoos and worse ideas
You feel alive
Do you feel alive?

You'll go off, you'll forget
You'll grow out of hanging from the edges
Breaking off the past

You'll know when to move up
You'll know when to take all the right chances
Never looking back

How could you think the time we spent was all wasted?
Sleepwalking through every morning, we took for granted
Maybe this time we spent was all wasted
We'll let it go, I'll let you go

You'll go off, you'll forget
You'll grow out of hanging from the edges
Breaking off the past

You'll know when to move up
You'll know when to take all the right chances
Never looking back

We are half alive and [Incomprehensible]
Now we don't belong to anyone at all
We are half alive and [Incomprehensible]
Now we don't belong to anyone at all

Somewhere hiding underneath
Kicking off covers while you sleep
You feel alive
