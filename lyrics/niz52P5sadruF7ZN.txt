Tell me
Who or what I'm supposed to be
I'm not entranced by your flashy ways
Your dark brown looks or your passing gaze
I said it before now try it just a little now

(I, want, you)
I've got to tell you
(I, need, you)
Girl, I love you
(I, want, you)
I've got to tell you
(I, love, you)
This hell I'm going through
Woah, oah, oah

Help me
I've come to grips with what's gonna to be
I can't get past those old fashioned ways
Your dark brown hips and that ass for days
I've said it before now try it just a little now

(I, want, you)
I've got to tell you
(I, need, you)
Baby I love you
(I, want, you)
I've got to tell you
(I, love, you)
This hell I'm going through
Woah, oah, oah
This hell I'm going through
Woah, oah, oah

(I, want, you)
I've got to tell you
(I, need, you)
Baby, I love you
(I, want, you)
I've got to tell you
(I, love, you)
This hell I'm going through
(I, want, you)
I've gotta tell you
(I, love, you)
This hell I'm going through
Woah, oah, oah
This hell I'm going through
Woah, oah, oah
Woah, oah, oah
