Tell me, doctor
Where are we going this time?
Is this the fifties?
Or nineteen ninety-nine?

All I wanted to do
Was play my guitar and sing

Take me away
I don't mind
You better promise me
I'll be back in time
Gotta get back in time

Don't bet your future
On one roll of the dice
Better remember
Lightning never strikes twice

Please don't drive at eighty-eight
Don't wanna be late again

Take me away
I don't mind
You better better promise me
I'll be back in time
Gotta get back in time
Gotta get back in time
Get me back in time

Gotta get back in time
Gotta get back in time
Get back, get back.
(Get back, Marty.)

Gotta get back in time
Gotta get back in time
Get back, get back.
