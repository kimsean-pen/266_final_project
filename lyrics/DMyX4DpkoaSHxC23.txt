Annie, don't run away
Where I can't find you
The game has gone too far
Talking
Alot of talk
Playing telephone, twenty city blocks
Annie, they have the dossier
The investigation's already underway
And I try Justine
She said to give you a ring
And I try to sleep but all I can hear's the beep

Answering
Answering machine
Answering
Answering machine
Just your answering (Won't you come)
Answering machine (And find me?)
Answering (Annie, won't you come)
Answering machine (And find me?)

Hey Man, this is Ric
Uh, Callie just called me
And she said she saw Annie acting in a dirty movie

Highway madonna
Evasion is her trade
There was no other
Now a shadow at her place
With the brush you left, I comb the alleyways
I don't miss a beat, the tableux stays in place
Annie, I was closing in
But I smeared the number walking in the rain
The girl down the hall, she said to give you a call
And I try to sleep but all I can hear's the beep

From your answering
Answering machine
Answering
Answering machine
Just your answering
Answering machine
Answering
Answering machine

Answering (Won't you come)
Answering machine (And find me?)
Answering (Annie, won't you come)
Answering machine (And find me?)

Just your answering (Won't you come)
Answering machine (And find me?)
Answering (Annie, won't you come)
Answering machine (And find me?)
