I want to be just like you

I've got these pictures keep on rolling 'round my head
I want to hang them on the wall above my bed
And it's so easy to step aside
And walk in line like all the rest
I never did well on tests

I don't watch TV cause it's just a box of lies
It makes me want to stick a toothpick in my mind
While the world goes down the drain
I eat my popcorn from the bag
Some people say that I've gone M-m-mad

(Talking)
I got-I gotta get down to the school house
And get some
A-A-And get some shoes
And-And get the right haircut
Get the right haircut!

You're so cool
I wanna be just like you
You're so cool
