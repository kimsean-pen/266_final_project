If we run far away, think we will ever die?
We'll throw all these books in the fire
Can you stop the train, cause it some delay
The change machine lied, and its too late
To scream, how long is the night

It's never over, it's never over
The ribbon is tied the card was never read
It's never over, it's never over
The ribbon was crimson, the color of the night

Can you see the handwritting on the walls
and on the autumn leaves that fall
OooOoo, what are we gonna do?
The trees are giving up on us
The needle and the thread
stitch us to the branch, and the night never ends

What are we gonna do
The trees are giving up on us
The needle and the thread (won't stitch, won't stitch us)
Won't stitch us to the branch, and the night never ends
The night, it never ends, it never ends
The night, it never ends

I will never sleep again
(I, I'll I'll never even close my eyes)
I will never sleep again
(I, I'll I'll never even close my eyes)
I will never sleep again
(I, I'll I'll never even close my eyes)
I will never sleep again
(I, I'll I'll never even close my)

If the suns on its way, then we will never die
and we'll follow these tracks to the sight
Now the lungs collapes, air is getting thin
All breath expired is it too late
To heal, how long it the night?

It's never over, it's never over
And the ribbon was tied the card was never read
It's never over, it's never over
The ribbon was crimson, the color of the night

Is all I ever see anymore
But the day looked so bright (bright)
In the pictures, in the photo album that you gave me
Is all I have, to live for (live for)

I'm falling down, I'm falling down
and you're not there to break my fall
I shut my eyes when you're around
I hold my breath to kill the sound
I'm falling down, I'm falling down
and your not here to catch my fall
I shut my eyes when you around
I hold my breath to kill the sound
I'm falling down, I'm falling down
And your not here to catch my fall
