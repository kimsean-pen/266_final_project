i was sure I lifted
[?] away
I am gonna get through

I can't go more than a day

I can't face myself
Trying to pull together
Trying to find the [?]
[?] that I'm in
Make the others disappear
This ain't all myself

Are you with me?
Are you with me when I'm gone?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Come along [?]
All the way, all the way back home
Are you with me?
Are you with me when I'm gone?

Who knows why you're asking?
[?] pictures in my hand
I can't go without it
And I hope you understand
I can't break myself

Are you with me?
Are you with me when I'm gone?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Come along [?]
I've got more to say, I've got more to prove you wrong
Are you with me?
Are you with me when I'm gone?
