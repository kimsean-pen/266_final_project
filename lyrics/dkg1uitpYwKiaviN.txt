A lazy red sky
I took too much drugs
Drink your youth
I'm the boss of this world

Call me boss boss boss boss boss boss
I take the killer with me
You can't run away from me
You can't look me in the eyes

Call me boss boss boss boss boss boss
Money can't fix me
Even drug dealers fear me
Your girlfriend fell for me

She came over to my home yesterday for me
But you can't come at me
Because you are afraid of me
Cause I'm the boss of this world

Call me boss
Call me boss
Call me boss
Call me boss

Call me boss
Call me boss
Call me boss
Call me boss

Call me boss
Call me boss
Call me boss
Call me boss

Call me boss
Call me boss
Call me boss
Call me boss
