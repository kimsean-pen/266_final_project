So grab your stuff and lets all go outside
bang your head to this tune in your ride
leavin' all your cares right behind
for the summertime
everybody's hyped to feel the vibe
Drinks are in cooler chilled on ice
lay back and unwind cause
nothing else matters
for the summertime

I've been working real hard
for just one reason
I've been waiting all year
for just one season
The season that reminds me of
palm trees The smell of ocean breeze
and the sense of bein' free
Barbecues and pool parties
What I call fun

Hangin with the hunnies
And enjoyin the sun
spending four hours just to clean the Benz
so you can cruise down the
boulevard with your friends
(Baha Men)
Sights on the beach have got
your mind blowin
Drinks in the chilled, The money is flowin'
Right here is where you belong
so if your down with me
then get on up and come along

So grab your stuff and lets all go outside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Leavin' all your cares right behind
for the summertime
everybody's hyped to feel the vibe
drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice
lay back and unwind cause
nothing else matters
for the summertime

*slurp* ah
Had to take a sip on ma's homemade
Freshly squeezed lemonade
Check out the hunnies through my
brand new shades
As they lay on the sand
Toppin' up on the tans
Take in the scenery
the mood is fine
Nobody's wearin their watches
Nobody's checkin the time
There is only one thing thats on
everybody's mind
that's the summer the summer
the summertime
(Baha Men)
Sights on the beach have got
your mind blowin

Right here is where you belong

Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Leavin' all your cares right behind
for the summertime
everybody's hyped to feel the vibe

(Baha Men)

to ya one time

(Aaron Carter)
Grab your stuff and lets go back inside
Then remove the tune that's in your ride
But didn't we have a good time?
(Aaron and Baha Men)
Destinations home, that's where we're going
the drinks are gone and the cash stopped flowin'
say goodnight to all of your friends
Cause when tomorrow comes
we'll do it all again
(just Aaron)
So grab your stuff and lets all go outside
