There's a hole inside of me
The shape of you
It's so deep inside me
That nobody can see it
When I try to fill it
With other people
None of them will fit
But I will try to keep trying

Maybe I think this one
This one can touch like you touch
Or laugh like you laugh
Kiss like you kiss
Smile like you smile
But no one smiles like you smile
No, nobody smiles like you

It's not just inside me the hole the shape of you
Everywhere I look now
Is somewhere that you are not
Holes are always hungry
And they eat the things we want to keep

Eat your life so slowly
Eat profane and holy
Eat it till you're wholly hole

Maybe I think this one
This one can touch like you touch
Or laugh like you laugh
Kiss like you kiss
Smile like you smile
But no one smiles like you smile
No, nobody smiles like you

I should learn my lesson
Holes are the illusion
Presence and absence and
Emptiness and nothing

When I am gone my darling dig me a hole
Let flowers grow above me
And wild berries
Then laugh and forget me
And before I'm cold
Let someone who loves you fill your
Hole
