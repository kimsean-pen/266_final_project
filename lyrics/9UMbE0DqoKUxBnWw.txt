The fire's inside us tonight
These bridges will burn so bright
Tomorrow bears our name
No more power games

Reaching for the light beyond
We will rise through the dark again
Ready to fight for what we believe to be right
Yesterday is dead and gone

Rattling the chains
Shaking the cage
Heed our war cry
Let there be no doubt
We want out
This is reckoning day

We are standing in the flames
Reaching for the sky
Fighting to the end
Yesterday is dead and gone

Under a blood red sky
Our voice will be heard in a world
Where compassion is lost
You try to control us
This is so absurd
Freedom will be won at any cost

Rattling the chains
Shaking the cage
Heed our war cry
Let there be no doubt
We want out
This is reckoning day

We are standing in the flames
Reaching for the sky
Fighting to the end
Yesterday is dead and gone

Yesterday is dead and gone

Rattling the chains
Shaking the cage
Heed our war cry
Let there be no doubt
We want out
This is reckoning day

This is reckoning day
Yesterday is dead and gone
