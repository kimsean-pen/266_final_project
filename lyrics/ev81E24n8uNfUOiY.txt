Hey man, it's not gonna work
It has nothing to do with you
I'm sorry, it's me, the thing is- I'm Picky!

I'm Picky and all the girls I drive them crazy
I drive them crazy 'cause I'm sexy
They call me sexy 'cause I'm hot, catch my knot
Don't you know I am so hot 'cause I am picky
And everything is in the lack
The lack of me into you thing makes you scream my name
Honey Holy Hole, that's the goal
To make you wonder why I'm cold and distant
I'm cold and distant, yes I am
I'm Picky 'cause I'm all alone
You know that it's crimi, yes it's criminal

I'm Picky 'cause I'm all alone
Maybe I'm alone 'cause I'm a picky one
I got a lotta girls waiting for me not to call
Another Sunday morning on my own
Maybe I'm too good for you
Or maybe you don't know me 'cause you know nada
I got a lotta comics to read on the throne
Good looking you and I could get along

Oh Porque, porque siempre dices lo mismo
Lo mismo shiza shy I am, bim bam bam
I fall down and shame again on me
'Cause you are laughing with your friends
About my weirdo comportamiento
I'm Picky yo, freaky no dating
Modelo and woman consistent and too persistant
I'm cold and distant
Remember me all the girls I drive 'em crazy
I drive 'em crazy 'cause I'm lazy, I don't give a damn
You know I'm fuckin' lazy, I don't give a damn

I'm Picky 'cause I'm all alone
Maybe I'm alone 'cause I'm a picky one
I got a lotta girls waiting for me not to call
Another Sunday morning on my own
Maybe I'm too good for you
Or maybe you don't know me 'cause you know nada
I got a lotta comics to read on the throne
Good looking you and I could get along

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Talk to me, walk with me
Talk to me, walk with me
Talk to me, walk with me
Talk to me you're picky!

I'm Picky, I drive them all crazy
I drive them all crazy
You know that I'm hot, hot, hot, hot
I'm Picky 'cause I'm all alone
Oh maybe I'm alone 'cause I'm a picky one
I got a lotta girls waiting for me not to call
Another Sunday morning on my own
