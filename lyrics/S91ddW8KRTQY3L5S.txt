I watched the rising light explode in a mountain stream
Then dropped my mind back on the scales of a small screen

They let you go too far alone
Everyone wants you home

I watched the harbor masts impale the sinking sun
As the shadows start to bleed I turn the noise back on

They let you float too far away
Now noone wants you to stay

Now you're praying for the vane beneath the rain
And the future goes without you in it's wake
It's all happening to noone again
You get your daylight from a screen

We watched the buzzing move through flames across the waves
As the world lost its limbs in a crash on PCH

How did life get so small again?
Who would even want to win?

Now you're praying for the vane beneath the rain
And the future goes without you in it's wake
It's all happening to noone again
You get your daylight from a screen

(Can't see the day)
(Can't feel the night)
