I am
Disintegrating
As I set fire
To the
Life that I once knew
In my last stand

To break free
From the ghost of me
I burn it down
A past life to the ground

A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
A skyline's severance

Dying
Seemed appropriate
For the old me
Living
Was so much harder
Lone and longing

To break free
From the ghost of me
I burn it down
A past life to the ground

A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
A skyline's severance

It hurts
So much to feel alive
To feel the tide
Breaking down, these waves will
Drown
It hurts
So much to feel alive
To feel the tide
Breaking down, these waves will
Drown

A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
A skyline's severance

Cleave from creation's hands
