I see he treats you like a stranger,
Though you've been here a hundred times before
Playing the game you need a changer
Closing the window, need an open door
And I don't like where I am
And my friends don't understand
Was it all part of the plan? For me?
So I try to be strong,
As I turned the tv on
But the static crystal know in my head

No pressure, no pressure,
Anything is possible,
You just need a miracle!
No pressure, no pressure,
Everything could change,
'Cause there's a silver linen on the way.

Yeah, I could go around my business
I drink my coffee, yeah I need the hit
Craving a little more attention
Yeah, I don't trust myself when I'm like this
So I try to be strong,
As I turned the tv on
But the static crystal know in my head

No pressure, no pressure,
Anything is possible,
You just need a miracle!
No pressure, no pressure,
Everything could change,
'Cause there's a silver linen on the way.

Am I feeling million miles away
You make it sound so easy when you say
No pressure
No pressure!
No pressure, no pressure,
Anything is possible,
You just need a miracle!
No pressure, no pressure,
Everything could change,
'Cause there's a silver linen on the way.
