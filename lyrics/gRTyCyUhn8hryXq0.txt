i woke up and the world outside was dark
all so quiet before the dawn
opened up the door and walked outside
the ground was cold

i walked until i couldn't walk any more
to a place i'd never been
there was something stirring in the air
in front of me, i could see

more than this
more than this
so much more than this
there is something else there
when all that you had has all gone
and more than this
i stand
feeling so connected
and i'm all there
right next to you

it started when i saw the ship go down
i saw them struggle in the sea
and suddenly the picture disappears
in front of me

now we're busy making all our busy plans
on foundations built to last
but nothing fades as fast as the future
and nothing clings like the past, until we can see
more than this
more than this
so much more than this
there is something out there
more than this
it's coming through
and more than this
i stand alone and so connected
and i'm all there
right next to you

oh then it's alright
when with every day another bit falls away
oh but its still alright, alright, alright
and like words together we can make some sense

much more than this
way beyond imagination
much more than this
beyond the stars
with my head so full
so full of fractured pictures
and i'm all there
right next to you
so much more than this
there is something else there
when all that you had has all gone
and more than this
i'm alone
feeling so connected
and i'm all there right next to you

more than this
more than this
more than this
more than this
