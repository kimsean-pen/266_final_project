I never met a man quite like you
Doing all he can, making my dreams come true
You're strong and you're smart, you've taken my heart
And I'll give you the rest of me too
You're the perfect man for me, I love you, I do
Mmm, I love ya

I never ever felt quite like this
Good about myself from my very first kiss
I'm here when you call, you've got it all
And confidence like I never knew
You're the perfect man for me, I love you, I do

You've got the charm
You simply disarm me every time
As long as you drive I'm along
For the ride your way
You said it before, there won't be a
Door that's closed to us
I'm putting all my trust in you 'cause you
You'll always be true, oh!

I never could have known this would be
Oh, you and you alone, yeah, all for me
I know you're the best, you passed every test
It's almost too good to be true
You're the perfect man for me, I love you, I do
You're the perfect man for me, I love you, I do, do
