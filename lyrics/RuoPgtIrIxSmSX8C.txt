Did we leave the candle burning?
Just to get to dodge the dark?
It gave a stunning light
It got us through the night

Know the world will keep on turning
With nothing left for us to spark
We'll make the same mistakes
We'll do it all again

Yeah, we left the candle burning
There's nothing left for us to feel
No shame in saying goodbye
We burned a hole in time

We set the world on fire
