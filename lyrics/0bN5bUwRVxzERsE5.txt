On an odd of questions and pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I'm a shelter for heartaches that don't have a home
Choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I'll say

Is fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you've got
Honey, I'm not afraid
We're back into games
And fire away

Well, I wish I could say
That I've never been here before
But you know and I know
That I'll always come back for more
Your love might be my damnation
But I'll cry in my grave

Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you've got
Honey, I'm not afraid
We're back into games
And fire away

Ohooow fire away

Take your best shot
Show me what you've got
Honey, I'm not afraid
We're back into games
And fire away

Ohooow fire away
Fire away
