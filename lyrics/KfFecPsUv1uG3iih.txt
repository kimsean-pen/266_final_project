It's really something else don't ask me to explain.
Out of sight is out of mind but this is crawling on my brain.
I'm sorry, I can't help you out but I'm too far away.
I'm closing in, holding out and there is nothing left to say.
Home is where my head will stay.
Home is where my hearts okay.
I've really lost it now.
I'm really not the same.
Out of step is out of touch my mind is pouring down the drain.
But, it's alright. You can keep me near, at least for a few days.
I'm falling out, breaking up with everything that keeps me sane.
