This and that, so and so
Maybe yes, maybe no, you said a lotta things
You said a lotta things
Eleven thirty-nine, I'll never be on time
I know I said a lotta things
I said a lotta things

And I should be happy
But I'm not
But I'm not
And I should be grateful, I know
But I'm not
But I'm not

I'm faking my own death so I can get some rest
I know, I thought of everything
I thought of everything
Standing on the corner, just staring at the sky
Oh man, I saw a lotta things
I saw a lotta things

And I should be happy
But I'm not
But I'm not
And I should be grateful
But I'm not
But I'm not
