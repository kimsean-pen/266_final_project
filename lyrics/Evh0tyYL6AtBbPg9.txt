As you climb up the stairs and come back forever
Summer's in the house, untamed it was
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee

A million joys, a million joys here
You could set your watch, how untamed it was
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
nononono no no no no no no no

As you climb up the stairsand come back forever
Summer's in the house, oh untamed it was

Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee

and melody of joys and
you can set your watch
whil hunting new words

Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee

And with us, oh no,

you can set your watch
or hunting new words

Walking with thee
Walking with thee

If you climb off the stairs
and come back forever
Someone's in my house or
hunting new words

Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
Walking with thee
