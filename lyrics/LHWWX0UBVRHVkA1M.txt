Music you're making me blue
While I'm alone with out you
Fill my heart and fill my soul with tenderness
Music fill my loneness

Music is still all around
It's time for changing all the sounds

How about your inspiration
it'll never end
Seasons all will choke a man

When spring is near the end I hear reliefs of summer

Autumn brings rhythm of the rain
Then it's hazy shade of winter

Music I love you so true
I'm just crazy about you
Without you I'd feel so sad
And full of pain music please come back again

When spring is near the end I hear reliefs of summer
Autumn brings rhythm of the rain
Then it's hazy shade of winter
