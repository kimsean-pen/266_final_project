My mood was in full swing
My mood was in full swing
I wanted to be free
Free to watch the hail
I did not want to hear
The perfect thing to say
Dying to squeeze out
The ugly truth for everyone to hear
I did not wanna fight
I did not wanna kill
I wanted to be real
I wanted to believe
That I was not the only one alive
