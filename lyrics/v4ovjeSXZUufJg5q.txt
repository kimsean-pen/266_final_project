Set adrift in the multiverse
By the whims of fate
In thrall to the demiurge
We all await escape

Darkness and light entwine
Everything is all the time
All around you points align
Everything is all the time

From beyond the waveform
Reaching the wall
Giving birth to a universe
Mother of all

Living information
Transverging space-time
Flowing down from the overworld
Into the mind of mankind

Darkness and light entwine
Everything is all the time
All around you points align
Everything is all the time

You want to live for eternity
To see behind the veil
Everything comes around again
The serpent eats its tail
