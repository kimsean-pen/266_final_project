Time's slippin' I've been slippin' up
Clock's tickin' and the spaces never feel like enough

Sweat's drippin' and I'm feelin' hot
Clothes are soakin' and I'm thinking when are they ever not

Nice to see you on your own
I know it's getting hard to navigate this world alone
Try to open up and see the world from each and every other side
You know

Gettin' lifted on the darker stuff
I'm different if I haven't had my regular cup

Lights flicker time to start the show
Gotta find a girlie 'cause the boys are surely rearin' to go

Nice to see you on your own
I know it's getting hard to navigate this world alone
Try to open up and see the world from each and every other side
You know
