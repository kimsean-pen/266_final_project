Vapor as thin as it gets
I stare right through
Its everywhere, sickness in this room
Not lying, it comes from you
So cold and deep
There wont be a time when I'm at ease
Increase, coldness
Increase, in your eyes
Please rewind and look at you
As on film you will see a mask of shame
I think you will perceice
Your position in this life
So unworthy
It's everywhere
Sickness in this room
Not lying, it comes from you
Find and twist the answer
Save no one from harm
As seen in the vision
Sick sleep sick, deader
