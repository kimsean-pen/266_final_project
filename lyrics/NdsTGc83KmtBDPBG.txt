Exorcise the demon that is living up inside you
After all you think you've been through
Just what have you been through?
Try to get beside yourself, this tearing at your insides
And did you end up on the wrong side, always standing so strong

Sharpen up your teeth
Your dreams are more than worth defending
In a fight that's never ending, go on
Go ahead and prove me wrong

The further you go, the less you know
You're born to quit
You've blown it (you've blown it)
You need to let go of letting go
You're full of shit
You're born to quit

Something supernatural, it seems it could possess you
No malevolence about you
Then that might not be true (that might not be true)
How they care to demonize the fucked up situation
How you killed off all the angels taking notice of you

Sharpen up your teeth
Your dreams are more than worth defending
In a fight that's never ending, go on
Go ahead and prove me wrong

The further you go, the less you know
You're born to quit
You've blown it (you've blown it)
You need to let go of letting go
You're full of shit
You're born to quit
You've blown it
You're born to quit

Sharpen up your teeth
Your dreams are more than worth defending
In a fight that's never ending, go on
Go ahead and prove me wrong

The further you go, the less you know
You're born to quit
You've blown it (you've blown it)
You need to let go of letting go
You're full of shit
You're born to quit
You've blown it
You're born to quit
You've blown it

(You've blown it)
(You've blown it)
