What would it take to make you see me
The way that I see you?
And what would it take to make you want me
The way I've always wanted you?

I don't know why You're in everything I see
And I can't deny that You're everything I need
So I reach in

Whatever it takes to get to You
Whatever it takes to break through
Whatever it takes You are my reason
For everything I do

Whatever it takes, whatever it takes
Whatever it takes to
Whatever it takes, whatever it takes
Whatever it takes

What would it take to make you fall for me
The way I fell for You?
And what would it take to make You fight for me
The way I've always fought for You

And I don't know why You bring me to my knees
But I can't unwind from how You twisted me
But I reach in

Whatever it takes to get to You
Whatever it takes to break through
Whatever it takes You are my reason
For everything I do

Whatever it takes, whatever it takes
Whatever it takes to
Whatever it takes, whatever it takes
Whatever it takes, whatever it takes

To get to You, to get to You
To get to You

Whatever it takes to get to You
Whatever it takes to break through

Whatever it takes You are my reason
For everything I do
Whatever it takes

Whatever it takes, whatever it takes
Whatever it takes, whatever it takes to
Whatever it takes, whatever it takes
Whatever it takes, whatever it takes
