A cloud hangs over
This city by the sea
I watch the ships pass
And wonder if she might be

Out there and sober
As well from loneliness.
Please do persist, girl

It's time we met and
Made a mess.
I picture your face
At the back of my eyes.

A fire in the attic
A proof o' the prize!

Anna Molly
Anna Molly.
Do do do do dume - do

Do do do do dume - do
Do do woh ho oh
A cloud hangs over
And mutes my happiness.

A thousand ships couldn't
Sail me back from distress.
Wish you were here, I'm
A wounded satellite.

I need you now
Put me back together
Make me right.

I picture your face
At the back of my eyes.
A fire in the attic

A proof o' the prize!

Anna Molly
Anna Molly
I'm callin' your name
Up into the air
Not one of the others
Could ever compare!
Anna Molly
Anna Molly!
Wait... there is a light...
There is a fire
Illuminated attic
Fate? or something better?
I could care less,
Just stay with me a while.
Wait... there is a light.
There is a fire
Defragmenting the attic
Fate? or something better?
I could care less,
Just stay with me a while.
