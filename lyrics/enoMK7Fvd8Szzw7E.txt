I openened my eyes
And greeted the new day
I follow your path way
To the secret of my pains

Can you free me
From these unsafe grounds
Secret tell me where did she drown

I'm moving away
But captured in your chains
I saw you in those waves
Those eyes, such pain

My heart knows
My mind knows
I am torn
My mind knows
When you're gone
I'm forelorn
