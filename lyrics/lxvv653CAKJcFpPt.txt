At twenty-two years old
They're telling me I'll never make it on my own
That I should leave it all behind and let it go
Let the industry decide my tomorrow
But I can feel it and I know I'm getting close
I stand on stage with people singing words I wrote
I feel the music make its way through out the doors
So if I gave it all up now I'll never know

You know that I can't be anybody else
I feel better when I know myself
You keep telling me I need your help
I won't ever need your help
No, I'll never need your help

At twenty-three years old
Took just under a year to prove them wrong
Now they decide they wanna listen to my songs
And take the credit for what I've already done
But everything I've done so far I've done alone
Now they left at leaving miss calls on my phone
Trying to cut in line for tickets to my show
I guess I knew I had it in me all along

You know that I can't be anybody else
I feel better when I know myself
You keep telling me I need your help
I won't ever need your help
No, I'll never need your help

No, I'll never need your help

I was told when I was thirteen I could do things
Others couldn't seem to believe 'til they met me
That's when I'd retreat to my dreams
Where I'd see things others couldn't see through a beat pen and poetry
Now I know I grieve for a reason
Now I know I write from the minds of a teacher
I used to watch the sheep as they wait for a leader
Now I guess they found out who I am

You know that I can't be anybody else
I feel better when I know myself
You keep telling me I need your help
I won't ever need your help
No, I'll never need your help

No, I'll never need your help
