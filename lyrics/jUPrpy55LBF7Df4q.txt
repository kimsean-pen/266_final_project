Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a dream
Things happen that are out of my control
So I walk alone
Constantly thinking thinking thinking to myself
But my voice I cannot hear
Where's there to go
I keep laughing ha ha ha ha ha
I Crazy I
Strange thoughts they come and go
Like nothing leaving shit up in my head

Home at last
Relief, no more weight on my shoulders
I was lost
Hard road to travel with no shoes on
So much pain

At times I don't say exactly what I mean
But don't treat me like I'm three bricks shy off a load
Seen many things, seen people talking talking talking out of turn
But still they can't be heard
But what do I know oh oh
I keep laughing ha ha ha ha ha
I Crazy I
Strange thoughts they come and go
Like nothing leaving shit up in my head

Home at last
Relief, no more weight on my shoulders
I was lost
Hard road to travel with no shoes on
So much pain

One man's trash, is another man's treasure

Home at last, know that life gets better
Final stretch I see a break in the weather
Been alone with my thoughts and I see clearer now I'm home

Home at last
Relief, no more weight on my shoulders
I was lost
Hard road to travel with no shoes on
So much pain

Home at last
Relief, no more weight on my shoulders
I was lost
Hard road to travel with no shoes on
So much pain
