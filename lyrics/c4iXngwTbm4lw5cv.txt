if you shared all these loves of mine
could you hold these feelings in time?
you're so cute, of course I wouldn't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind

and when the day comes to you I'll say
girl let's make love everyday
enjoy the sun and take a drive down to LA

we could stop by the hills with trees
I'll pick a flower in the summer breeze
and I'll ask you to be my baby
my baby

I had a million prayers all those nights
under these stars I knew I couldn't lie
I didn't need a single one
to call you my girlfriend

so I'll be there when you are sad
when you feel like you need someone
when all hopes lost and you need to run
I'll be your boyfriend

we can stop by the hills with trees
I'll pick a flower and I'll get on my knees
and I'll ask you to marry me
marry me
