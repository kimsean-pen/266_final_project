As I stand in this empty space
I hear the sound of my heart ache
Ooh, I lost you in the summer rain
Never thought you'd break my heart
Because I loved you from the start
Ooh, tear drops in the summer rain

I know I really want it cause I can't sleep long after midnight
Tomorrow don't mean nothing if I wake up holding my pillow tight

I've been praying secretly
If I bring you back to me
Will you hold me in the summer rain?

I know I really want it cause I can't sleep long after midnight
Tomorrow don't mean nothing if I wake up holding my pillow tight
I know I really want it cause I can't sleep long after midnight
Tomorrow don't mean nothing if I wake up holding my pillow tight

Never thought you'd break my heart
Because I loved you from the start
Ooh, tear drops in the summer rain
Every night I have a dream
You're lying next to me as I sleep
Ooh, hold me in the summer rain

I know I really want it cause I can't sleep long after midnight
Tomorrow don't mean nothing if I wake up holding my pillow tight
I know I really want it cause I can't sleep long after midnight
Tomorrow don't mean nothing if I wake up holding my pillow tight

I'm-a miss all of you my baby
I got no soul
You're all I really want, that's why I can't let go

Well I don't care who says, "You're wrong, I'm right."
No I don't care, I want you back in my life

La la la la, la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la
La la la la, la la la, la, la

No I don't care
