My arms are all twisted
The only thing I miss is
I messed up I missed it
I messed up the missing of you

It's getting to sound
Like they've seen you around
With her

No mystery
No mystery
No mysteries

Everyone knows
The secretest code of mine
They'll tell all my friends
And they'll tell all my enemies too

Mystery
No mysteries
No mysteries

No mystery
No mystery
No mysteries

Take it away, Nick!

I don't even know what it's like
Not to go back to you
I don't even know
Who I like less
You or me
You or me
You or me

It's anyone's, anyone's guess
It's anyone's, anyone's guess
Stress, stress!
Dress
Stress, stress, stress!
Dress!
