I can see it in your eyes
See it in your face
Banging on your chest
Acting tough looking unfazed

Tripping over landlines
Cutting deep with a dull blade (blade)
Running out of unrest
Goin' out of your mind

Lonely days will follow
Days will follow
And the gaze that stuck
The halls will know your name

Hit me like a tidal wave (ooooh)
Triggered by the aftershock
Hit me like a tidal wave (ooooh)
Triggered by the aftershock
Hit me like a tidal wave (ooooh)
Triggered by the aftershock

I can see it with my own eyes
The tracks down your face
It can't be easy tryna unwind
Sleepin' on your day dreams

I'm not tryna role play
I keep thinkin' break us take the wheel
These days can break
But I'm gonna take the wheel
You know I can't feel this pain in my heart
Because it's honestly been falling apart
Maybe I'm too blind to see
How trouble finds me
Well if it's here I'm gonna see where it leads
Call me Mr. Lonely
