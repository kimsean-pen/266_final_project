So what do you want to be when you grow up?
Michael Jackson

I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna throw my hands
I just want a mic with a stand
I just wanna (I just)
I just wanna catch one glance
I just wanna see you dance, girl
I just wanna (uh)
I just wanna shine like Michael (hey)
I might moonwalk on sight (ho)
I just wanna (I just)
I just wanna ride my bike
And if you don't mind we can ride all night
Talk to me, say
I just want a art school chick, that really like foreign flicks
I just wanna (I just)
Boyfriend jeans and Vans for the kicks, that's still dumb thick
Girl, I just wanna (uh)
I just want a sports car, manual stick
Candy paint, Tokyo drift, let's shift
I just wanna blow your mind
And love you for you because right on time
Talk to me, say

I just wanna show you something
You should put your guard down, we could be some stars now
Little mama don't be fronting
You should put your guard down, we could start now
I just wanna be, I just wanna be yours
For the night
I just wanna be, I just wanna be yours
Is that alright?
I just wanna be, I just wanna be yours
For the night
I just wanna be, I just wanna be yours

I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna jig like Mike
I just wanna spend my night with you girl (I just)
I just wanna be your type
You them other type, you ain't even my height girl
I done been climb trees since I was like three
With the palms to the sky and the sun with the breeze
Come and try to have so much fun with me
When your song come on, throw the buns at me (booty)
Proceed to make it bounce like a Chevy with the high
Try to come and follow through the clouds in the sky
If we bounce that high you may need a parachute
Some cushion in your boots and some peaches for your pie
I'ma eat that peach then beat the walls
Down like Jericho till it falls (what else?)
Water works, put in work
Hop in, rocket, peace, skrrt

I just wanna show you something
You should put your guard down, we could be some stars now
Little mama don't be fronting
You should put your guard down, we could start now
I just wanna be, I just wanna be yours
For the night
I just wanna be, I just wanna be yours
Is that alright?
I just wanna be, I just wanna be yours
For the night
I just wanna be, I just wanna be yours

Run it back
I just wanna be, I just wanna be yours
(I could be your only)
For the night
I just wanna be, I just wanna be yours (for one night)
Is that alright?
I just wanna be, I just wanna be yours
(I could be your only)
For the night
I just wanna be, I just wanna be yours
I just wanna, I just wanna
(I could be your only, one night)
(I could be your only)
