From up here this town don't look so bad
I'm looking down at this place I hate and at least for a second it seems okay
But I'm not getting over it, getting used to it
It's been so long since everything seemed to fit
And it's not a case of being scared or undeserving
I'm just questioning the purpose of leaving what I thought was pulling me down
But I'll bite my tongue and grit my teeth

I'll leave my heart where I leave my home
I never thought that I'd be on my own
I never knew that I had this in me
I kinda think it came all too quickly

But I know that growing up's a part of growing up
So I guess I'll just face the facts and throw my bags up on this broken back
I'll learn from my mistakes and find a place where I can breathe
Somewhere that I can breathe

I'll miss the smell of the rain on my road
The dirty streets of the town I call home
My friends that kept me from feeling alone
And the broken promises you made that forced me to grow

And I'll miss the paths I've walked a thousand times
The mistakes that I made, the lessons learned from the nights
That I spent with my friends in this town I resent
All 'cause this is the last of time that I'll spend around here
