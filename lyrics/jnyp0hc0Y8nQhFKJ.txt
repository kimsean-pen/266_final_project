She walked down the yard, caught the longest train she seen
She walked down the yard, caught the longest train she seen
Said, she'd ride and ride "till the blues wear offa me"
It's two bullyin' freight trains runnin' side by side
It's two bullyin' freight trains runnin' side by side
They done stole my rider and I guess they's satisfied
They rode in the Delta, kept on easin' by
They rode in the Delta, kept on easin' by
Know I feel just like she said her last goodbye
Friend, she won't write, she won't telephone
Friend, she won't write, she won't telephone
Makes me believe to my soul rider calls that "gone"1
But if I had wings, friend, like Noah's dove
Friend, if I had wings, friend, like Noah's dove
I would raise and fly, God knows, where my lover was
I laid down at night, I can't sleep at all
I laid down at night, I can't sleep at all
Awful lyin' there wondering if someone rollin' in her arms
Laid my head on my pillow, friends, it be's too high
Laid my head on my pillow, friends, it be's too high
Taken down with, I'm gettin' sick and 'bout to die
