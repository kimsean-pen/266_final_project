Open your heart to me I won't stop...
I'm coming at your sleep
There are no mirrors here
What you want is clear what you feel

Again ... walking down...
Even if she says so, I won't let go

Open your heart to me don't believe the tricks
... only bad dreams
There are no mirrors here
I am who I am and want you to see

I can't ...but tonight I'm cruising
Even if she says so, I won't let go.
