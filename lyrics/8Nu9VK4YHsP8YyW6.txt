I measured the Skies, now the Shadows I measure
Skybound was the mind, Earthbound the body rests
I fought against Minds, but I followed my Heart
I lived by the Laws of the Nature and the Stars

I travelled the Oceans now I must travel farther
Beyond this Horizon, I can see the Harbour
I sought out fot the Truth and the Order of the all
now I must lie to rest and hear the angels call

If you lift your head at night and gaze that starry sea
ponder the wonders of those lights, and think about me

I measured the skies, now the shadows I measure
Skybound was the mind, Earthbound the body rests
Inertia
