Kimmy, I'm too nervous
To talk about this now
I tried not to say your name
But it just kept coming out

When I see you later
I'm gonna have to figure it out
When I see you later

Kimmy, I'm a disaster
And I don't wanna pretend
That I'm not gonna get more intense
When we finally connect

When I see you later
I'm gonna have to figure it out
When I see you later
I promise that you'll want me around
All the stars in the sky start aligning or something
Shimmering sweet nothings
When I see you later

The sun is burning through the gray
And soon enough we'll breathe
Until then please just tell me how to be

When I see you later
I'm gonna have to figure it out
When I see you later
I promise that you'll want me around
All the stars in the sky start aligning or something
Shimmering cheap nothings
When I see you later, yeah!
