No trust space
No stayin' up all late at night discussing
All the things that really don't mean nothing
Tryna be something we can't define, i-ine
Let us just focus on forgetting
All the things that we just think were missing
See, I'm just on a different kind of mission
And you can come on with me if you like, li-i-i-i-ike
I don't wanna keep wastin' time
Reading between the lines
When it just feels so right

Baby, when you touch me
I don't want it to stop
Want you more than on my mind
Baby, when you touch me
I don't want it to stop
Want you more than on my mind, mi-i-ind, uh

If it was something (Something)
That could keep me going 'til the morning (Morning)
Damn, you shoulda came out with a warning (Warning)
But it don't matter, I still woulda tried, tri-i-i-ied
I don't wanna keep wastin' time
Reading between the lines
When it just feels so right

Baby, when you touch me
I don't want it to stop
Want you more than on my mind
Baby, when you touch me
I don't want it to stop
Want you more than on my mind, mi-i-ind, uh

He-e-e-ey
More than on my mind
He-e-e-ey
He-e-e-ey
He-e-e-ey
On my mind

Baby, when you touch me
I don't want it to stop
Want you more than on my mind (More than on my mind)
Baby, when you touch me
I don't want it to stop
Want you more than on my mind, mi-i-ind
