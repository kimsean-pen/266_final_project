I made it up
It's complicated
I gave up
On giving it a name
Things are implied
Nothing's the same
Worried I won't remember where to begin
I wish this would end

What will it take for us?
What will it take for us?
What will it take for us to

If you pray for us
Pray for love
It might just save us from
It just might

I made too much
Overrated
I gave too much
As if there was something to gain
Things are implied
Nothing's the same
Worried I won't remember where to begin
We must decide

If you pray for us
Pray for love
It might just save us from
(It might just save us from)
It just might
Wish us godspeed
Oh, please, whatever it might be
Tell it about the way it is
