you Walked
into
the room
tonight
your lips
reflect
the light

you caught
my eye
but i
did shy
your hand
across
my thigh

i know i'd
rather complain
guys like you
need to relay
pretty boy
this will be fun
youll be mine
for day has come

your skin
so smooth
exist
the mood
you dance
like you
don't care

i work
the place
you lose
some space
but still
i feel
you still

i know i'd
rather complain
guys like you
need to relay
pretty boy
this will be fun
you'll be mine
for day has come

Let it roll off your tongue
im gonna have me some fun
don't stand there looking all dumb
like you've been hit with a stun gun
when you rub up my hip
i get a quivery lip
cinematic un-zip
deep dip
go for it quick
roll that back
to my flat
trust is broken
hit that cat
sack that fat
make that mack
just relax
wanna take a bath
I, play like a guitar hero
tolerence from no to zero
get you off like Robert Shapiro
talk to me DeNiro
lets get suspect
lets get wet
every little defect gets respect
just protect
what you expect
quicker on the reflex
hit the deck
lets get suspect
lets get wet
every little defect gets respect
just protect
what you expect
quicker on the reflex
hit the deck
lets get suspect
lets get wet
every little defect gets respect
just protect
what you expect
quicker on the reflex
hit the deck
lets get suspect
lets get wet
every little defect gets respect
just protect
what you expect
quicker on the reflex
hit the deck

i know i'd
rather complain
guys like you
need to relay
pretty boy
this will be fun
you'll be mine
for day has come

i know i'd
rather complain
guys like you
need to relay
pretty boy
this will be fun
you'll be mine
for day has come

every little defect gets respect

i know I'd
rather complain
guys like you
need to relay
pretty boy
this will be fun
you'll be mine
matches in love
