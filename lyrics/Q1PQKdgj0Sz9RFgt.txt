The grey is clear, but too cold to continue...
No
Not there
Here
Unclear as time
More space than shown
New bouts of fear
Here nothing is known
Years of carry on
Thoughts gone to too old to see it through
Greenest greens smothered by deeper blues
The sea speaks
Better halves remain in you
Tilted your cloud
Now tilt my hand and change my view again
Held still as everything spins
Heart and mind redefined
It has a taste
Chased down what I've denied
Human as angels bloomed from the sky
Fallen from truth
Now continue
Forgot what I think I thought I'd known you knew
Come on back before sorrow burns right through
Oh, to be the dream
To be cut into
To be cut anew
To be continued
To be
