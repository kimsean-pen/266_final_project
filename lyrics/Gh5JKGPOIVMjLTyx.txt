if you're so prone
to accidents
and misunderstandings
you may accidently
misinterpret honesty
for selfishness

we're two human beings
individually
with inherent
interest in each other and
how we relate

if you're still prone
to accidents
and misunderstandings
you won't understand me
or my motivation
for being alone

we're just two human beings
individually
with inherent
interest in each other and
how we relate

considering everything
me leaving with regrets
only makes sense
i'll see you when we're both not so emotional
