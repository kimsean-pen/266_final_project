Emptiness inside from all abandoning
Cast away from everybody close to me
Feeling like a parasite
Get away, leave tonight
Something must be wrong with me
Gone without a chance to speak
You make me question who I am

You know what.

I'm done asking why
We can never go back
We can never make this right
Now every time
Someone disappears
A piece of me it dies
You can keep what's broken but you can't have what's left inside

It's best that you're on your way
You used me to get ahead
Then turned your back on me
If I see you now it won't be pretty

How can you sink so far down?

You make me question who I am

You know what.

I'm done asking why
We can never go back
We can never make this right
Now every time
Someone disappears
A piece of me it dies

When did a promise
Become so dishonest?
When did using all you can become your plan?
You can keep what's broken but you can't have what's left inside

Fragments still remain
I'm still standing
Can't get to me

How could you do this?
Don't say another word
Or somebodies getting hurt

I'm done asking why
We can never go back
We can never make this right
Now every time
Someone disappears
A piece of me it dies

When did a promise
Become so dishonest?
When did using all you can become your plan?
You can keep what's broken but you can't have what's left inside

No you can't have what's left
