I'm a horrible shot, I tie a horrible knot
I pushed a bunch of little people over once
Well a rest is best when you stress a test
And you forget all about your aching ass

I'm a horrible shot, I tie a horrible knot
I muck ace a lot, I'm gonna pace the lot
Don't be tardy for my leaky Barbie TV party
Pee in the park

Well I can't believe you're better off alone
You stood near stone
And I can't believe I'm better than you know
I felt the rush of no control

And it feels so good
And it feels so good
It feels so nice

Now turn your back
'Cause I'm coming right up on you
Turn your back
'Cause I'm gonna be all up on you

Placing a bet, my odds are you and me zero
Being a vet, I know that you are too fearful
Placing a bet, my odds are you and me zero
We can regret, all the things we could be doing instead

I'm peeling into the house
Gotta run to the basement
Gotta establish a connection before I get impatient
I'm no contortionist man, I'll steal the lips off your eyes
But anyone who really matters got a call from my guy

I can't believe, I can't believe that I can't breathe
I can't believe, I can't believe that I didn't see
See the smoke in my eyes
Feel the pain in my lungs now, go
See the smoke in my eyes
Feel the pain in my lungs now, go

Reset this best of four, I know
You've been waiting by the telephone, I know
But it's not how or why I lie
You think I wanna be a mediocre guy?

Reset this best of four, I know
You've been waiting by the telephone, I know
But it's not how or why I lie
You think I wanna be a mediocre guy?

See the cracks in my skin
Feel the blood on my feet now, go
See the cracks in my skin
Feel the blood on my feet now, go

I know one girl
That's not gonna get home tonight
I know one girl
That's not gonna get...
Home!

Heat seeking ghost of sex
Don't pay attention to my mild case of blow tourettes
Whaaaat!
I probably placed a bet, took your missing tooth
There's no people left in line for your kissing booth
I always knew all of the things that you thought you think
Twice times I'll probably tell you that your god's a geek
Point and glide till you're ostracized
Then pile patents on my beak 'cause right now it's innovation week

Innovation, innovation, innovation week
Innovation, innovation, innovation week
Innovation, innovation, inno...

Well I can't believe you're better off alone
You stood near stone
And I can't believe I'm better than you know
It feels so good

Now turn your back
'Cause I'm coming right up on you
Turn your back
'Cause I'm gonna be all up on you

Placing a bet, my odds are you and me zero

Placing a bet, my odds are you and me zero
