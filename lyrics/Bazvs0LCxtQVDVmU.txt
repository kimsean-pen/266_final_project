You're the darkness in me

I...
I'm waking spirits tonight
And I can't hear your voice
I got nothing to hide
'Cause you're with another boy
And I'm carving the sky
I'm having visions manifesting us in time

So I arrive from the coast
I've got three more days
I know you want me the most
Want me in an altered state
I've been sleeping with ghosts
And I swallow medication
You should know

Strike a match and whisper my name (burning, burning)
Speak in tongues, bend me 'til I break (running, running)

And I'm giving in to your fever touch
Let it all begin when the fire starts
You're the darkness in me, Palo Santo
And the memories are filling up with smoke
You'll remember me and I start to choke
You're the darkness in me, Palo Santo
Oh (burning, burning)

Does the mark on my skin
Make you hot with shame?
'Cause I'm in love with the sin
And I know how to take the blame
And I let you win
Do I look good in this position, just like him?
Ooh

Strike a match and whisper my name (burning, burning)
Speak in tongues, bend me 'til I break (wanna bend me 'til I break)

And I'm giving in to your fever touch
Let it all begin when the fire starts
You're the darkness in me, Palo Santo
And the memories are filling up with smoke
You'll remember me and I start to choke
You're the darkness in me, Palo Santo
Ooh

I want, I want, I want all the danger
Come on, come on, come on, keep me craving
This sweet intoxication shakes my soul
I want, I want, I want entertainment
Come on, come on, come on, keep me craving
This sweet intoxication shakes my soul (my soul)

And I'm giving in to your fever touch
Let it all begin when the fire starts
You're the darkness in me, Palo Santo
And the memories are filling up with smoke
You'll remember me and I start to choke
You're the darkness in me, Palo Santo

(You're) You're the darkness
(You're) You're the darkness
You are the darkness in me, Palo Santo
You're (you are), you're the darkness (you are)
You're (you are), you're the darkness
You are the darkness in me, Palo Santo
