Few may hear Galileo's song (calling)
A tribulation

Adversities
Fuel for a living, feeds us all

Spirit is fire
Uncompromising
Hidden hand, protect us from
The dead and dying

Echo his madness
His heresy feeds us all

Spirit is fire
Uncompromising
Hidden hand, protect us from
The dead and dying

Few may-

Spirit is fire
Feed on the senseless ending

Spirit is fire
Feed on the senseless ending
