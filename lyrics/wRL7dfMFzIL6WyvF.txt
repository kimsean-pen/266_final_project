Boys you won't remember
from the minute
you walked into the room
every letter started broken hearted
and ended way too soon
lived through underrated
getting jaded
to wind up with no one
hiding in new places
singing "I guess we're done"
I don't want you to wonder why
it won't do any good
you don't know what you got into
until you know when its all gone wrong
and I don't feel the need to try and explain
