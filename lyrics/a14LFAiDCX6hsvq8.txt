I left your house when you were sleeping
Having correctly had my head screwed on
Tried to find a way to write a note
Couldn't get your shower to work

I sort of wish that it was raining
So that I could pull the hood up on my coat
I'm always happy to be leaving
Could be the company I'm keeping

Like when you're looking for your shades
Rifling through your pockets
And you find them on your face

Ooh I can't escape it, abnormal behavior
Uncontrollably vapor
And on, bout some/
Thing done
Sooner or later
This strange little arrangement
And all of its exchanges
Must cease

Shouldn't have come back
Shouldn't have switched it on at all
Didn't mean to hold you so close
But you know how it goes

I sort of wish that it was sunset
I kind of wish that it was New Year's Day
On a vacant street
I cast a long-eyed shadow

Like when you're looking for your shades
Rifling through your pockets
And you find them on your face
Walking around in a daze
I don't want to stop it
Baby let you trade

Ooh I can't escape it
Abnormal behavior, uncontrollably vapor
And on about some/
Thing done
Sooner or later
This strange little arrangement
And all of its exchanges
Must cease

Not easy to see where to go
The misty middle twist and swallow
The curves are the only part
I know
And maybe takes a side of cool
Oooh
AwO0ou
