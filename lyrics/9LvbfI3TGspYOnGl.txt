Bring your own lampshade
Somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending
Can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade
There'll be plenty enough room in jail

If being alone's a crime I'm serving forever
Being strong's your kind
I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime
We hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line

On the prairie pavement
Losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work
And never going fishing
Water all around
Never learn how to swim now

If being alone's a crime I'm serving forever
Being strong's your kind
Then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime
We hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

Bring your own lampshade
Somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending
Can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade
There'll be plenty of room in jail

If being alone's a crime I'm serving forever
Being strong is what you want
Then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime
We hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line
Catchin' time
At the swingin' party down the line
