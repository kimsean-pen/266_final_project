I try to know when to leave
She sits in the bedroom and grieves
There's a sequence that starts all again
She can't get up anymore with the pain
The combination of these drugs
Has left her hopeless and lost
She wants to count the ways
But she can't count again

I will be right here
'til all the pain
Just disappear
I will always stay
'til all this light
Just kills the day

I strangle my words
Once, I tried a thousand times
Slaughtered like Gods
When the silver shines so hard
I tried to poison my life
Always dreaming of the edge of the knife
She always looked backwards
And I can sit here for even ten minutes or more

I will be right here
'til all the pain
Just disappear
I will always stay
'til all this light
Just kills the day

I will be right here
'til all the pain
Just disappear
I will always stay
'til all this light
Just kills the day
