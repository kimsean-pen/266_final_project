The night is when the ghosts all come out
Playing with my head, spin it all around
This room is like a prison cell, I'm all by myself
I'm waiting for my friend to come and break me out

You left me today lying on the floor
I wanted you to stay, it seems you wanted more
This bed is like a prison cell, cause I'm all by myself
Still waiting for my friend to come and break me out

And there's stone cold bars on my door for this stone cold heart

Some people say life is like a ride
Take it day by day, never knowing why
My head is like a prison cell, I'm all by myself
I'm waiting for my friend to come and break me out
Still waiting for my friend to come and break me out
