Oooooh oooh
Creatures seem to scream and faint
Shadows blink and the laws will brake
Questions we could never solve
As answers in darkness evolved
Oooh oooh

Moving space but not in time
Choices made but nothing's right
Flakes of memory played by disease
Have only seen what I wanna see
Oooh oooh

The dream I take
To awake
When my mind's a mess
