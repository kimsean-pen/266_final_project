Take these roses off of me
Let me live, let me be
for a little while
Let my eyes
see everything and nothing in their time
I do not mind

Who'd have guessed I'd ever learn
To let the walls around me burn
and light up the hillside
My words
I ate them for so long
and nothing changed
it was just the same

And I don't know if you see me here
but I can tell you your face is clear
I will see you...

Chorus:
Forever
Forever
I will see you
Forever
Forever

Call me close once again
Call me teacher, call me friend
Just like the first time
Call my name
it echoes in the walls around this room
it's all you

And I don't know if you hear me there
when it's dark and no one cares
I will hear you...

Forever
Forever
I will hear you
Forever
Forever

And I wanted you to be
Everything to me
And now I've got to learn to carry on
And I know I cannot hide
this emptiness inside
Nothing is the same since you're gone

Send me letters from above
Send me strength, send me love
such sweet love
Sing me songs that echo in my head and in my heart
that's where you are...

And I don't know if you feel me here
I can tell you one thing is clear
I will feel you...

Forever
Forever
I will feel you
Forever
Forever
And I will hear you
Forever
Forever
And I will see you
Forever
Forever

Take these roses off of me
Let me live, let me be
