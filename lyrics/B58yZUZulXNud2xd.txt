Hey look out for that movin' van drivin' down our streets!
You better lock up your man before he meets

The new girl in town who just came on the scene
The new girl in town can't be more than sixteen
And she's got a way of makin' a boy act like a clown
Woah, woah, woah, woah
We don't know what to do 'bout the new girl in town

The new girl in town seems to dance on air
The new girl in town, she's got the coolest hair
You better tell the home coming queen to hold on to her crown
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Or she's gonna lose it to the new girl in town

She's hip, so cool
I'm gonna get her after school
And yet we'd like to be like her
Cause she's the kitten that the cats prefer

Ladies, step aside!

The new girl in town, has my guy on a string
The new girl in town, hey look, she's wearin' his ring
I can't stop crying, and so in my own tears I'm gonna drown
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Cause he wants to rendezvous with the new girl
We kinda sad and blue, yes, it's true girl
We'd like to say... to the new girl in town
The new girl in town
Woah, woah, woah, woah

From out of the blue girl
This town's in a stew girl
What a hullabloo girl
She ain't just passin' through, girl
She's stickin' like glue, girl
To the man I thought I knew, girl
Woah, woah, woah, woah

Hey look out for that movin' van
Look out, look out, look out, look out!
She was a new girl in town
