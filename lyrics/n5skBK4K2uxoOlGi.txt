One two three four wake me up before I get sore

Quakin' right under my feet
The alligator is comin' for me
I paid him off but he still needs to eat
So I'll put him up and I'll give him a feast

You're not as scaly as you think
you're just a fuzzy little bean
You've got some problems just like me
So I'll give you a break and something to eat when you're not feeling pretty like me

You're not as scaly as you think
Only the exterior of a softhearted bean
