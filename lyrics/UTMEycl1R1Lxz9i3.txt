A Saturday beach day
here with your cousins and friends
A bottle of Budweiser
sits in the sunburnt sand

We're hours from the suburbs, far from the pools
Step in the ocean where everything's cool

Forget about weekdays in 1982
You know you don't see the same things we do

And today, the sun is gonna shine

A Saturday beach day,
with girls in their summer tans
On the jetty with your best friend
and a newspaper as a fan

There's sand in your sandwich and sand in your hair
We're catching a buzz from the ocean air, baby

Forget about weekdays in 1992
You know you don't see the same things we do

And today, the sun is gonna shine

Forget about weekdays in 2022
You know you don't see the same things we do
