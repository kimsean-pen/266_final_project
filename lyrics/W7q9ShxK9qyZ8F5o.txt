I came apart inside a world made of angry people
I found a boy who had a dream
Making everyone smile
He was sunshine
I fell over
My feet like bricks underwater
And how am i supposed to tell you how i feel?

I need Oxygen
Oh baby, if i was your lady

I would make you happy
I'm never gonna leave, never gonna leave
Oh baby, i will be your lady
I am going crazy for you
And so i found a state of mind

Where i could be speechless
I had to try it for a while
To figure out this feeling
This felt so right, Pull me upside
Down to a place, Where you've been waiting
And how am i supposed to tell you how i feel?
I need Oxygen

Oh baby, if i was your lady
I would make you happy

I'm never gonna leave, never gonna leave
Oh baby, i will be your lady
I am going crazy for you
And you dont wanna keep me waiting
Staring at my fingers feeling like a fool

Oh baby, if i was your lady
I would make you happy

I'm never gonna leave, never gonna leave
Oh baby, i will be your lady
I am going crazy for you yeah-oh
Tell me what you want
Baby tell me what you need
Anything i ask baby give it to me
Baby give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Baby give it to me give it to me
I came a part inside a world made of angry people
I found a boy who had a dream making everyone smile
