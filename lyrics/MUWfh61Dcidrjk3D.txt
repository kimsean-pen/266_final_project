Typhon is alive, descending with allies
From the mountain of the snake, in the deepest night of Pan
Typhon will return with Erebos and Nyx
And a vision of the storm, and the ocean and tethys

The dragon breaks the temple wall
The flood will drown our gods
Break down the wall
And let another kingdom rise
The castle of Olympia
Is shaking by the storm
The king lost his crown, and now the wall is tumbling down

Typhon overthrow, the throne of father Zeus
The creation of the gods, and the order of mankind
Typhon is alive, descending with allies
And the empires will fear all the power of her wrath

The dragon breaks the temple wall
The flood will drown our gods
Break down the wall
And let another kingdom rise
The castle of Olympia
Is shaking by the storm
The king lost his crown, and now the wall is tumbling down

The dragon breaks the temple wall
The flood will drown our gods
Break down the wall
And let another kingdom rise
The castle of Olympia
Is shaking by the storm
The king lost his crown, and now the wall is tumbling down

The dragon breaks the temple wall
The flood will drown our gods
Break down the wall
And let another kingdom rise
The castle of Olympia
Is shaking by the storm
The king lost his crown, and now the wall is tumbling down
