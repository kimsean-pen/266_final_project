Taught to be afraid of me, so you don't understand
I'm hanging on the edge but you won't reach for my hand
If we came face to face you would see no difference between you and me
We are the same
But we let the hate radiate out of us like the sun
Watch it burn through our veins

Divided by the colors
Split by our beliefs
Forced against each other
Nothing's as it seems
But between white walls
We could forget it all
The fear would fade, we could start to change
A world divided and afraid

The rumors and lies, pull us apart
Leaving us on separate sides
On display like a work of art
These lies are here to keep us in the dark

Divided by the colors
Split by our beliefs
Forced against each other
Nothing's as it seems
But between white walls
We could forget it all
The fear would fade, we could start to change
A world divided and afraid

We need to break the cycle of hate!
We need to break the cycle of hate!

Divided by the colors
Split by our beliefs
Forced against each other
Nothing's as it seems
But between white walls
We could forget it all
The fear would fade, we could start to change
A world divided and afraid
