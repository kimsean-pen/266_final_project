I hope you realize, baby
Just what you mean to me
Hey, you where I run for cover
Your loving shelter for me

And when I find myself needing some lifting up
One night with you and that always is enough
Hey, you make being in love a true rare affair
So take me, I'm your prisoner

Will you sentence me to be your lover for life
Your lover for life
Will you sentence Merci
I wanna be you lover for life
Your lover for life

Your lover
Your lover

I just want to hear you say
You'll be my lover, my lover for life
Capture, there's no getaway
You're my lover, my lover for life

Under your spell or under my own power
It really doesn't matter to me
See I fell in love, the first time I saw you
And have been falling in love ever since

You heard my testimony, you've seen my evidence
Hey, it's a crime of passion, in every sense
And justice won't be served, till you stay here in my world
So take me, I'm your prisoner

Will you sentence me to be your lover for life
Your lover for life
Will you sentence me, I wanna be your lover for life
Your lover for life

Your lover
Your lover

I just want to hear you say
You'll be my lover, lover for life
Capture, there's no getaway
You're my lover, lover for life

You heard my testimony, you've seen my evidence
Hey, it's a crime of passion in every sense
And justice would be served if you stay here in my world
So take me, I'm your prisoner

Will you sentence me to be your lover for life
Your lover for life
Will you sentence me, I wanna be your lover for life
Your lover for life
Your lover
Your lover
I'm your prisoner
Take me, I'm your prisoner
And sentence me to be your lover for life
I'm your prisoner
Take me, I'm your prisoner
And sentence me to be your lover for life
Your lover
Your lover
