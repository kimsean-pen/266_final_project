Old world underground where are you now?
Subtract my age from the mileage
on my speeding heart, credit cards
accelerate, accumulate
looked for you downtown
wound up in a movie with no story
now it's late and you are nowhere to be found

Hesitation's always mine
hesitate outside the times
with all I don't say
with all I don't do
I'm sending you
Invitations to hesitate too

Every ten year-old enemy soldier
Thinks falling bombs are shooting stars sometimes
But she doesn't make wishes on them
When she wishes, she wishes for less ways to wish for
More ways to work toward it
Ten year-old enemy soldier
Our falling bombs are her shooting stars

Hesitation's always mine
hesitate outside the times
oh call me or drop me a line
say you've been with me
say you've been with me
say you've been with me
this whole time

Old world underground I never knew you
But I've seen your face everywhere
there was a farm before we tore
the small town down
multiply divide
