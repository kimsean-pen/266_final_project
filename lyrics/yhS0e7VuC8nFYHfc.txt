If it came to pass that they should ask
What could I tell them
Would they criticize behind my back?
Maybe I should let them

Oh, if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

If they could face it
I could take it in their eyes, oh, I know I'd make it
The tiny minds
And sacred cows just fake it

If only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

But I know the way they want me
In the way they publicize
If they could turn their focus off
To the image in their eyes

Maybe it would help them, help them understand
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
That a full-blooded city boy is now a full-blooded city man

Oh my soul, oh my soul, oh my soul
Oh my soul, oh my soul, oh my soul
Oh my soul, oh my soul, oh my soul
