If you're saying in your mind, "You're better off dead"
Well before the madness comes to claim your name
(A million years would go by)

(Tell us a story)

What could I say? What should I say?
It took all of my words and my fantasy worlds
And at the heart of it all there was nothing
How they meet their maker is their right
While they're alive, it's beautiful

Let there be light
Let there be moon
Let there be stars and let there be you
Let there be monsters, let there be pain
Let us begin to live again

From the top to the bottom
Genesis

Beyond the universe, beyond the mind

All the world us in this together
Feel no fear, we're fearless forever
So why can't we just sail away?

Because you're so in love with this island of the mind
Know that is this island is home
You've got to get on your feet again (Genesis)
Get on your feet again

But without your self, what'll become of you?
(Take your leave now, shut up, shut up, shut up)

Please don't take me from my youth
(Take your leave now, shut up, shut up, shut up)

When we're apart, we fall
Together we feed the world

So let there be light
Let there be moon
Let there be stars and let there be you
Let there be monsters, let there be pain
Let us begin to feel again

From the top to the bottom
Genesis
