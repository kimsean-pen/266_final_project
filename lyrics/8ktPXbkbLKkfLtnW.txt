I know you've been hurt before
But never say never babe
Slow down don't close the door
You've been waitin' forever babe

See I,
I know your heart's been scarred
But you've come this far
So baby don't run away
I, I know you're close to giving up
I just wanna give your love a try...
To keep a smile on your face

So open your eyes to see
That we belong together
Hey yaa
Doesn't surprise you
Finer things can be much better

Yeaah!
I wanna take you to a place
Where love is something more than you imagine yeah

I put it right in your face
Girl, it's yours
All you gotta do is reach out and grab it
You waited all this time
You waited all this time
I put it right in your face
Girl, it's yours
All you gotta do is reach out and grab it

You played your cards
He left you with a broken heart
Baby I'd never, I'd treat you like treasure
It's not your fault
I know you took it hard
But that was his mistake
For us it's never too late
Can't live your life empty
I know it's hard to move on
But you just got to forget it
Cause baby the sky is clear
The rain is gone, the sun is shining

I put it right in your face
Girl, it's yours
All you gotta do is reach out and grab it
You waited all this time
You waited all this time
I put it right in your face
Girl, it's yours
All you gotta do is reach out and grab it

You waited all this time
You waited all this time
You waited all this time
You waited all this...
Time to get up girl and take a chance
It's nothing to be scared of
Just grab my open hand
If you need someone by your side
With another time
Another day
I'll be there
You know I will
Cause...

I put it right in your face
Girl, it's yours
All you gotta do is reach out and grab it
You waited all this time
You waited all this time
I put it right in your face
Girl, it's yours
All you gotta do is reach out and grab it

I put it right in your face
Girl, it's yours
All you gotta do is reach out and grab it
You waited all this time
You waited all this time
I put it right in your face
Girl, it's yours
All you gotta do is reach out and grab it
