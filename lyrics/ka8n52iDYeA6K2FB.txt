Your world a grain of sand
I am the endless desert
The burning horizon
I am the aeons
Beyond the pitch black night
Time and space collide in me

Baphomet
Power absolute
Baphomet
Goat God Dominus

I am the moment of eternity
Your hearts, your tears, your lust
I am the well
The gaping abyss
I am blasphemy divine

Baphomet
Power absolute
Baphomet
Goat God Dominus

No force can compete
No god be compared

Non mortuum
Non vivit
There is only me

In me all things become
There is no god
Where I am all things are gone
My blinding darkness
Oh, so bright
Dualistic demon worship

Baphomet
Power absolute
Baphomet
Goat God Dominus
Baphomet
Divinity unbound
Baphomet
True will magick
Baphomet
Ego sum
