Maybe we'll never learn?
The fire at the gates is our saving grace
Remember we were born to burn
There is a holy hell where we can save ourselves
There is a holy hell where we can save ourselves

We will be cast out of paradise
It's a long ascent out of the black
But we all have to sacrifice, hang the iconoclast
And kiss the feet of the amnesiac
'Cause the moment is dead when I'm lost in the past

Maybe we'll never learn?
The fire at the gates is our saving grace
Remember we were born to burn
There is a holy hell where we can save ourselves

But now the rivers are running red
And the stars have been set ablaze
I've been fearing the worst again
Heavenly terrorist, have you been mourning over yesterday?
Don't forget to br–µathe when the knife begins to twist
Fuck this self-pity, it's not that hard to see
We get one chance, these wounds will set me free
There's poison on the key, it brings you to your knees

But even the mountains erode in the rain
A single spark can start a forest fire
Light one match and burn down the empire
There's gold buried in the blue, oh
There's gold buried in the blue

Holy Hell, I've got nothing left to lose
And I can tell there's gold buried in the blue

Maybe we'll never learn?
The fire at the gates is our saving grace
Remember we were born to burn
There is a holy hell where we can save ourselves

Holy Hell, I've got nothing left to lose
And I can tell there's gold buried in the blue

But even the mountains erode in the rain
A single spark can start a forest fire
Light one match and burn down the empire
There's gold buried in the blue
There's gold buried in the blue
