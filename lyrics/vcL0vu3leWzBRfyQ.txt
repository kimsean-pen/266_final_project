I never knew anyone could have been so cruel
I never knew anyone could have been so cruel
What did I do?
What did I do?
What did I do?

I never hurt anyone if they weren't that fun
I never heard anyone try to steal my song (?)
What did I do?
What did I do?
What did I do?

You can never say you loved me
If you can stand to see me cry
What did I do?
You said lots of things to hurt me
I will try to ignore the pain
What did I do?

I never knew anyone...
