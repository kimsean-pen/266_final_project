i wont see your smile
And i won't hear you laugh anymore
Every night i wont see you walk through the door
'Cause time wasn't on your side

It isn't right
I can't say I love you
It's too late to tell you
But I really need you to know

Oh baby no
I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me

I'll hold on to the memories baby
Now baby can you hear me
Wherever you may be
Tonight

Are you near me
I need you to be
By my side

'Cause I never said goodbye
It isn't right
I should have said I love you
Why didn't I just tell you

God knows I need you to know
Oh baby no
I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart

You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories baby

Somewhere I know you'll be with me
Someday in another time

But right now you're gone
You just vanished away
But I'll never leave you behind

Oh baby no
I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
(I won't let you go baby)
(Never)
You will always be here with me
(On and on and on and on forever and ever ohhh .)
(no, no, nohhh)
(Never)
(No baby, no baby ohhhh...)
(ohhhahhlways, always)
(fohhhhh. nohhh nohhhz)
(no baby, no baby)

End
