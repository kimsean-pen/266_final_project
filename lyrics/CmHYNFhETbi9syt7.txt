Windows closed,
The doors are sealed.
Scent of alcohol... and
Candles have been lit.

Midnight intoxication...
Writhing in terror,
Hallucinating...
In suicidal moan.
The words I spoke,
The verses I've read,
I reckon I invoked
This impending dread!

Haunting jewel—
Gleaming curse!
Primeval worship—
Yuggothian spell

Devouring fear
Numbs mind and soul.
Windows locked and nailed
And chimneys sealed.

Caught within the terrifying grip of night...
Left without protecting bulbs of light.
Numbed by thunder, lightning strikes.
It seizes hold of my weak human mind.

Haunting jewel—
Gleaming curse!
Primeval worship—
Yuggothian spell

Blurred visions of
Unimaginable sights.
Existences and worlds
Left untold!
Light is dark and
Darkness is light!

I remember Yuggoth
I remember the ultimate void

Azathoth,
Have mercy!
Yog-Sothoth,
Save me!

I see their priests and candlelit altars
Preying on my humble human soul...
Iä... ngai... ygg! I can see it...

Winds of hell,
Titanium cloud
Black wings,
The three-lobed eye.

Nyarlathotep...
