(I don't know)

Mincer ray don't worry
If the road's a little worn
It's a cold and filthy cavern
That we're traveling on

Richer day assured me
Of the weak-link mending plan
Danger's always there to follow
Just do the best you can
And a light shines down...

Mincer ray don't worry
If the road's a little worn
It's a cold and filthy cavern
That we're traveling on
And a light shines down
And a light shines down.
