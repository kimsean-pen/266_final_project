Surprise
I must have let it get in
Started to turn in to somebody else
Yeah I found myself believing
And time my feet are nailed to the floor
I always thought we would get there somehow
I always thought there'd be more, more

Well not anymore
Well not anymore
Well not anymore

Mouth taped shut
Crippled and frozen with fear
That may be happens to somebody else
No no, that doesn't happen round here
I wont forget I know who I am
No matter what I know who I am
And what im doing this for

Well not anymore (and I can't seem to wake up)
Well not anymore (and I can't seem to wake up)
Well not anymore (and I can't seem to wake up)
