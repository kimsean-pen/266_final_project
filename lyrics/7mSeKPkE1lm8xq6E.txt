You wake up, you wake up in the morning
Your darling kiss, your darling is a surprise
Your darling kiss because you're far,
Should it be
Crazy times spent with you, and wait for me around here
Like a fall, like a fault that brings me to crawl
Pretty face, pretty face to the sea
You wake up, you wake up in the morning
Your darling kiss, your darling is a surprise
Your darling kiss because you're far,
Should it be
Crazy times spent with you, and wait for me around here.
