When I am tired
And late at night go for a walk
I have to work
Or else I do not recognize myself
Laugh, food and colors
When my heart wishes years of treasure
Seemingly foreign
But somehow still it is familiar

It could be under
It could be animal or ander
They do resemble
They do remember one another

It was not natural, not at all
Only human hate
Could give us something so unforgiving
It was not natural, not at all
Only human hate
Could give us something so unforgiving
Something so unforgiving

As I expected
With time it hasn't gotten easier
I have to work now
At things that used to be like breathing

I try to focus
Forgive myself for having so much
I am too busy fooling
Or else I am not busy enough

When I see clearly
I know we share the same devotion
The joy is hungry
And you know one can promise anything

It was not natural, not at all
Only human hate
Could give us something so unforgiving
It was not natural, not at all
Only human hate
Could give us something so unforgiving
Something so unforgiving
