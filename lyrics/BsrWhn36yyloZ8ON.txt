Well I can hardly stand
But I really don't care to know
And you can take my hand
But I don't care where we go
And if you think you know
What I'm thinking about
Then I can read your thoughts
Without any doubt
So we can go
Well let's go home

And if I happen to fall
Then please don't pick me up
Cause we're enjoying our time
And I wouldn't want to interrupt
They worked out so well
When you discovered that it's all the same
We get lost sometimes
But the reality will keep us sane

I know I think too much
I know I waste my time
And I can't figure out
Which one is yours or mine
That's fine
I really couldn't say I mind
