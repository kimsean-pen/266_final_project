Sent to a world cold as steel
Don't know where else I have been
Where will I go? - I can't tell
Who would save us if we fell
Can you feel what I see?
In blind faith would you believe?
Don't share my point of view
But it may mean a lot to you

Tell me will we remember
How it used to be?
Will it be the same
In a time in the future?
Will there be a different way
Can one ever say?

Anthem for a distant world
We'll all be alike
Be there till eternity
One will see
When salvation comes our way

All my life I was sure
Kept my thoughts clean, real and pure
Just as I will always know
We're down here to learn and grow
I am my own entity
And the world is there for free
Keeps me alive till that day
When my soul will find the way
In another dimension
You may find paradise
We'll be safe and warm
I've been told there will be everyone
I held so close and near
There will be no fear

Anthem for a distant world
He'll be all alike
Be there till eternity
One will see
When salvation comes our way
