Secluded in a marker stone, not only deadlier
But smarter too, smarter too
All along the tomb, all along the ruin
Secluded in a marker stone, not only deadlier
But smarter too, smarter too

I could live a million
I could live a million
I could live a million
I could live a million years

Secluded in a marker stone, not only deadlier
But smarter too, smarter too
All along the tomb, all along the ruin
Secluded in a marker stone, not only deadlier
But smarter too, smarter too

I could live a million
I could live a million
I could live a million
I could live a million years

All along, all along, all along the tomb
Secrete in, secret in, secret in the ruin
Secluded in a maker stone, not only deadlier
Smarter too, smarter too

I could live a million
I could live a million
I could live a million
I could live a million years
