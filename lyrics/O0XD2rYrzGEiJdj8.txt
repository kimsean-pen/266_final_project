Some days in my mood
My body, my soul
Flashing sights of crew
It's bullets in my heart
Just a reaction
To the things you do
Pushing me further from you
Sip through this way, fearing few

I'm through, I'm through
I feel split in two
I'm through, I'm through

Some days in my mood
How many more, many days of silence
Flashing sights of crew
How many months, many days of silence
Just a reaction
Pushing me further from
Sip through this way, fearing few

I'm through, I'm through
I feel split in two
I'm through, I'm through

Who was that that is happy?
Am I at all?
