I don't know, just that it's our time to go
Into the shadow of night
Even so, it don't make it easier
I'll be the first to admit that
Something tells me now that [?]
Forgotten how to make invisible [?]
You open up your mind, I talk to the ground
You run until we drown, keep running now
Because it's true, I'll only play this game for you
I always knew my heart is just a chain for you
Is it so, I thought you knew the difference
But I guess that you're right
In the open, we'll keep turning pages
And hope the apple is ripe
Because it's true, I only play this game for you
(You know I only play this game for you)
I always knew my heart is just a chain for you
(You know my heart is just a chain for you)
Stop your sweetness, I don't need it
You know you can't fool me
I always knew my heart is just a game for you
Game for you
Play the game, baby
Play the game
I'm starting the game
Until the end, I'll play it
Play the game
Because it's true, I only play this game for you
(You know I only play this game for you)
I always knew my heart is just a chain for you
(You know my heart is just a chain for you)
Stop your sweetness, I don't need it
You know you can't fool me
I always knew my heart is just a game for you
Game for you
