I almost lost everything I got to this
Scratch at my soul, I clench my fist
Counting the lights on my way out
There's no time to lose
Must replay the scene
Save me from myself
I've been in the dark too long
Paper mache love
Make me believe that I can change
Make me believe that I'm not strange
At all
I almost lost everything I got but this
Board the windows, lock up the bliss
Turn off the phone, make it stay out
Stillness said and leave me silent
As I take on the next round
Save me from myself
I've been in the dark too long
Paper mache love
Make me believe that I can change
Save me from myself
I've been in the dark too long
Paper mache love
Make me believe that I can change
Make me believe that I'm not strange
At all
Turn off the lights
We could stay out
Turn off the lights
Make them stay out

Save me from myself
I've been in the dark too long
Paper mache love
Make me believe that I can change
I've been in the dark too long
Paper mache, mache love
Make me believe that I can change
Make me believe that I'm not strange
At all
