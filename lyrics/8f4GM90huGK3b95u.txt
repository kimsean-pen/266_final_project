Don't blame your death
On the shit in your head that you claimed ate you like a virus for days on end
Watched you decay
Watched you waste away

Who'd you think you'd fool, baby, digging your own grave?
So go ahead

Yeah just drop dead

And while you're trying to fool the whole world don't forget that you'll decay
And you'll waste away
You can't cheat death when you're digging your own grave
You're out of line

Buried yourself alive
And expected to be fine

You can't rewind
When you're choking on your own dirt
Begging for your life
Your bridges are burning. (All your bridges are burning)

And all the tables are turning. (All the tables are turning)
You started a fire and you're
Burning up, up

Burning up
Burning up, up

Burning up
Burning up, up
Burning up (Hey, hey!)
Burning up, up

Burning up
Burning up, up
Burning up
What you give is what you get
And in your case that's nothing but guilt and regret
And all the flames you kept in your brain
Came out your lips and sent you straight into your own grave
You were a walking, talking, corpse at best
And I swear I couldn't wait to get you off my chest
And when you asked us why
We couldn't look you in your eyes
It's hard to find life
In something that's already died
You're out of line
Buried yourself alive
And expected to be fine
You can't rewind
When you're choking on your own dirt begging for your life
Your bridges are burning. (All your bridges are burning)
And all the tables are turning. (All the tables are turning)
You started a fire and you're
Burning up, up
Burning up
Burning up, up
Burning up
Burning up, up
Burning up (Hey, hey!)
Burning up, up
Burning up
Burning up, up
Burning up
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Yeeeeaah
You started a fire
You're out of line
Buried yourself alive
And expected to be fine
You can't rewind
When you're choking on your dirt
Begging for your life
Your bridges are burning. (All your bridges are burning)
And all the tables are turning. (All the tables are turning)
You started a fire
And you're
Burning up, up
Burning up
Burning up, up
Burning up
Burning up, up
Burning up (Hey, hey!)
Burning up, up
Burning up
Burning up, up
Burning up
