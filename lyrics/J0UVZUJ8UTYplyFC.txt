Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me

To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete

Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire, a fire a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart
We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark

All the boys, all the girls, all that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls, all the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows, as the room a-spinning goes

We'll run riot
We'll be glowing in the dark

So we'll soar
Luminous and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark
