Get on the party bus
Faking a good time
Suffer the little people
All the way to the end of the line

You can call a spade a knife
But anyone can see you're paid to lie

The rich get richer
And the sick get sicker
There's so much to be denied

The checks get bigger
And the tricks get cheaper
Now you're messing with the gaslight

What did you see
And what did you sign

You can call a spade a knife
But anyone can see you're paid to lie

On and on and on
The con you run

Altering history
Making it all so hard to believe
You can call a spade a knife
But true is true and you lie
