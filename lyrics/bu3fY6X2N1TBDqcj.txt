We can't dwell on what could've been
All apologies
The road that stretches out is calling us to find our way back home
You said it yourself, you said it yourself

I know I'm hard to stomach
But we need to move and get out of here
Before this joint erupts
And anywhere we go, we'll feel stuck

Oh, what you want from me is not impossible
Just give me some time to figure a way out of this mess
For you and me and I will, I will

Oh, you said it yourself, you said it yourself
What you said, when you said what you need from me

All apologies won't make things right with you tonight
Oh, can't you see, as you drag me, I'm your favorite toy
Oh, I'm so sorry but make up your mind, we're out of time
Oh, mama, please, I'm on my knees, I'm your favorite boy

Now it's hard for me to come clean and I'll tell you why
I'm too damn ashamed, too damn ashamed
Did you miss me? Don't you lie
See, I told you so

Your broken heart is all my fault
There's no room to disguise
Oh, don't you cry, don't you cry

Oh, you said it yourself, you said it yourself
What you said, when you said what you need from me

All apologies won't make things right with you tonight
Oh, can't you see, you're dragging me, I'm your favorite toy
Oh, I'm so sorry but make up your mind, we're out of time
Oh, mama, please, I'm on my knees, I'm your favorite boy

Your favorite boy, your favorite boy
Your favorite boy, your favorite boy
Your favorite boy, your favorite boy

Oh, you said it yourself, you said it yourself
What you said, when you said what you need from me

All apologies won't make things right for you tonight
Oh, can't you see, you're dragging me, I'm your favorite toy
Oh, I'm so sorry but make up your mind, we're out of time
Oh, mama, please, I'm on my knees, I'm your favorite boy
