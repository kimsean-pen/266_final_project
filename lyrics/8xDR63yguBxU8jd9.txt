Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh

I'm a good girl in the dark
I'll rip right through your beating heart
Should I stay?
Or should I go?
Push it deep down, don't let it show

Maybe I'm done
Fade away like a memory
Maybe I'm done
Lose yourself, feel the energy
Maybe I'm done
Fade away like a memory
Maybe I'm done
Lose yourself
Ah-ooh-ah, ah-ooh-ah

I'll be a bad girl, Valentine
I'll burn into your dirty mind
Waiting is the hardest part
Fake it 'til I think you will turn to pieces
You will be my work of art
I'm caught in the physical
How long can I keep on hanging on?

Maybe I'm done
Fade away like a memory
Maybe I'm done
Lose yourself, feel the energy
Maybe I'm done
Fade away like a memory
Maybe I'm done
Lose yourself
Ah-ooh-ah, ah-ooh-ah

(Ha ha ha, ha)
(Ha ha ha, ha)
(Ha ha ha, ha)
(Ha ha ha, ha)

I'm caught in the physical
How long can I keep on hanging on?

Baby, I'm done
Fade away like a memory
Baby, I'm done
Lose yourself, feel the energy
Baby, I'm done
Fade away like a memory
Baby, I'm done
Lose yourself
Ah-ooh-ah, ah-ooh-ah
