You push the button and we'll do the rest
The exotic
Sound of data storage
Nothing like it
First thing in the morning
You push the button and we'll do the rest
Bastard Latin
That's the best thing for it
You push the button and we'll do the rest

You and Lizzy in the summertime
Wrappin' my tiny mind 'round a lullaby
There are things that I just cannot explain to you
And those that I hope I don't ever have to

Pattern language
In the mood for love
You push the button and we'll do the rest

You and Genie wearing Stetson hats
Tryin' to gain access to my lily pad
There are things that I just cannot explain to you
And those that I hope I don't ever have to

The world's first ever monster truck front flip

I'm just a bad girl tryin' to be good
I've got a laser guidin' my love that I cannot adjust

Forward thinking
Model villages
More brain shrinking
Moving images
You push the button and we'll do the rest
