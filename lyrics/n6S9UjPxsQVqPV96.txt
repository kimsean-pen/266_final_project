Now that the furniture's returning to its goodwill home
With dishes and last week's paper
Rumors and elections
Crosswords and an unending wars

The black in our fingers
Smeared their prints on every door pulled shut
Now that the last month's rent is scheming
With the damage deposit

Take this moment to decide
(Sun in an empty room)
If we meant it, if we tried
(Sun in an empty room)

Or felt around for far too much
(Sun in an empty room)
From things that accidentally touched
(Sun in an empty room)

Hands that we nearly hold
With pennies for the GST
The shoulders we lean our shoulders
Into on the subway, mutter an apology

The shins that we kick
Beneath the table, that reflexive cry
The faces we meet, one awkward beat
Too long and terrified

Know the things we need to say
(Sun in an empty room)
Then said already anyways
(Sun in an empty room)

By parallelograms of light
(Sun in an empty room)
On walls that we repainted white
(Sun in an empty room)

Sun in an empty room
Sun in an empty room
Sun in an empty room
Sun in an empty room

Sun in an empty room
Sun in an empty room
Sun in an empty room
Sun in an empty room

Take eight minutes and divide
(Sun in an empty room)
By ninety million lonely miles
(Sun in an empty room)

And watch the shadow cross the floor
(Sun in an empty room)
We don't live here anymore
(Sun in an empty room)
