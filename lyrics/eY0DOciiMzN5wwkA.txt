My heart's gone
He no longer lies by my side
He left at dawn
And once again I lie alone

Still endless days and nights
I wait for you
Cause deep inside this flame
I know it's true

Forever starts today
Forever we will be
Forever's every day
Forever faithfully

It's been three weeks
(You know I had to leave)
Your voice is all I have to hold
I lie here alone
(I'd be there if I could)
Awaiting for my love's return

Still endless days and nights
I wait for you
Cause deep inside this flame
I know it's true

Forever starts today
Forever we will be
Forever's every day
Forever faithfully

And through it all
No matter
It all comes down to you
And through it all
No matter
It all comes down to you

Forever starts today
Forever we will be
Forever's every day
Forever faithfully

Forever we will be
Forever faithfully
Forever we will be
Forever faithfully

Forever I will be
Forever I will be
