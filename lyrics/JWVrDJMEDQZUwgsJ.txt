Cast away in solitude between the divide of dimensions
Frozen in timeless aura, a catalyst of colors
The abyss...
I was born in the fibers of oblivion; the saturnine keeper of mystery
and malevolent patriarch of chaos

...they fade into the shadows I cast... (evermore in sorrow)

Darkness! Chaos! A malediction! An abomination!!

...they fade into the silence I keep...

Dark Matter Gods
The abyss is the elder of time
Dark Matter Gods
The void is the archetype of being

For each step; nihility, a paradox, an epoch, a quantum crevasse...
Worlds are lost in my path

...they fade into footsteps I leave...

Dark Matter Gods
The dark mass is the father of all
