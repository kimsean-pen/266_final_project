In another dimension
Like clothes that you wear
A mighty mighty battle
Sprouting illegal hair
A fitness consultant
In the negative zone
Wandering the city
Looking for a home

I dance like this
Because it feels so damn good
If I could dance better
Well you know that I would

How the rumour got started
One can only guess
And the truth don't mean nothing
If you ain't got the cash
A credit card mommy
An invisible dad
Career opportunities
That you never had

We dance like this
Because it feels so damn good
If we could dance better
Well you know that we would

I'm working on my dancing
This is the best I can do
I'm tentatively shaking
You don't have to look
Can't say I'm sorry
I can't say I'm ashamed
Can't think of tomorrow
When it seems so far away

We dance like this
Because it feels so damn good
If we could dance better
Well you know that we would

We dance like this
Because it feels so damn good
If we could dance better
Well you know that we would
