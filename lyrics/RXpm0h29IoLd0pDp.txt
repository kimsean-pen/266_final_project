He wears a key
She wears an axe
Sky shifts from light
As they float on their backs
Then it leapt from the woods and bit through the bone
How to die how to die how to die

It's great, ending, and it's only so
Let it slow down
Let it slow down
Cause it seems to me that it's all money
Let it slow down let it slow down

Out at the pass
Sets on deer
Runs fast as fast
Til safe in the clear
But it leapt from the woods and bit through the bone
How to die how to die how to die
How to die how to die how to die

Because it seems to be
That it's all money
Let it slow down
Let it slow down
