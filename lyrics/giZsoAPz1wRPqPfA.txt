I can hear the music
Just a few notes from a passing car
And it can take me
With heart-opening speed
To somewhere not here
I'm hell stuck still
By a sight of something
Nothing much to see
But enough to catch me

Send me absolutely elsewhere
Take me absolutely right here

You don't need a god
To pray I'm here
You don't need a god
To stay out here
You don't a need a thing
But what we have
Right here

It can be one word
Or the smallest thing that only I see
It's like lightning
And it change the way I feel

Sends me absolutely elsewhere
Holds me absolutely right here

You don't need a god
To pray I'm here
You don't need a god
To stay out here
You don't a need a thing
But what we have
Right here

You don't need a god
To pray I'm here
You don't need a god
To stay out here
You don't a need a thing
But what we have
Right here
Right here
Right here
