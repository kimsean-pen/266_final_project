I was born in that summer when the sun didn't shine
I was given the name that doesn't feel like it's mine
Lived my life as the good boy I was told I should be
Prayed every night to a religion that was chosen for me

Sold my soul, broke my bones, tell me, what did I get?
Did my time, told the line, ain't seen anything yet
Strike me down to the ground, you know I've seen it before
Make it hurt, I'll eat the dirt, I just don't care anymore

How could you break my heart?
Already played my part
I kept my promise man
Show me the promiseland

Don't occupy my throne
Give me the crown I own
Lived like you told me how
Look at me now

I've got no money in my pocket and the whole world's bringing me down
And the whole world's bringing me down

One person's lie is just another man's truth
We got done running from the devil, but the devil was you
Every time I see the light, I'm falling deeper in debt
If I've never seen the good how can I come to an end?

Sold my soul, broke my bones, tell me, what did I get?
Did my time, told the line, ain't seen anything yet
Strike me down to the ground, you know I've seen it before
Make it hurt, I'll eat the dirt, I just don't care anymore

How could you break my heart?
Already played my part
I kept my promise man
Show me the promiseland

Don't occupy my throne
Give me the crown I own
Lived like you told me how
Look at me now

I've got no money in my pocket and the whole world's bringing me down
And the whole world's bringing me down
And the whole world's bringing me down

How could you break my heart?
Already played my part
I kept my promise man
Show me the promiseland

Don't occupy my throne
Give me the crown I own
Lived like you told me how
Look at me now
