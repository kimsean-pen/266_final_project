On the line
On my conscience
Burning bright
Touch the surface

Gather round
Save a seat
There's a hole inside
There's a show to find

Grab yourself another seven drinks,
My love
There's danger in the sermon,
Don't you think, my love

Living just to wait for
A dancer that will last

Hail to the slave and the sacrifice
These mountains and the
Stars tend to steal the light
So young until we're
Told that they gave us life
Now movement is
A virtue and vice tonight

By the sound
By the window
Over ground
There's the answer

Gather round
Save a seat
There's a hole inside
There's a show to find

Appease me with your
Warm and mild fangs, my love
The villagers are terrified
And wild, my love

Swirling through the ether,
The dancer in the mask

Hail to the slave and the sacrifice
These mountains and
The stars tend to steal the light
So young until we're
Told that they gave us life
Now movement is a
A virtue and vice tonight

Hail to the slave and the sacrifice
These mountains and
The stars tend to steal the light
So young until we're
Told that they gave us life
Now movement is a
A virtue and vice tonight

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Hail to the slave and the sacrifice
These mountains and
The stars tend to steal the light
So young until we're
Told that they gave us life
Now movement is a
A virtue and vice tonight

Hail to the slave and the sacrifice
These mountains and
The stars tend to steal the light
So young until we're
Told that they gave us life
Now movement is a
A virtue and vice tonight
