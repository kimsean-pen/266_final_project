Unconditional love
And a lack of patience is what you gave me
You say I worry too much
While you take up habits
Buried deep within me
My temper's cutting through to call you out
It makes me sick inside to know

You let me down
But you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast
As time moves slow
You let me down
But you'll never let me go
Let me go

The hand that used to feed
Is now a mouth wide open
It's all so different
Excuses hold up the walls
That keep you hidden
I don't see progress
We're drowning slowly in the shallow end
It makes me sick inside to know

You let me down
But you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast
As time moves slow
You let me down
But you'll never let me go
Let me go

Spare me the uncertainty and blank stares
Because I can't cope
Spare me the anxiety, it's not fair
And let me go

Unconditional love
And a lack of patience is what you gave me

You let me down
But you'll never let me go
Tell me when we lost control
My heart beats fast
As time moves slow
You let me down
But you'll never let me go
Let me go
So let me go
