Vacancy in a burned out frat
You're an empty stare from a vagrant cat
You're a vagabond
Bag is packed and you move along

Mona came from the sea
Caught land gracefully
Night is cold but you know it felt so free

Camped up in a graveyard
Took a job to clean some tombstones
Like lovers in a shadow of a crooked dream

It's a long, hard day at a work
They called you mad for singing
Oh, do you remember when you blew away?
The wind rolls through the trees
It's neither faith nor warm
The sun has set when you come to find me there

Frozen in a ditch
Cold, deep stare like a cat
And we'll move along

Sean Pierre came from the roads
His artwork remains unsold
He holds such a heavy load
You know it's so far gone
He tells me he can hack it
In his old black leather jacket
Keep a hold on to your strangest
We're rollin' home

When you meet him at the train station
He was dressed to the nines
Things are changing now, we move along

Vacancy in a burned out frat
You're an empty stare from a vagrant cat
You're a vagabond
Suitcase packed and you move along

You'll move along
You'll move along
You'll move along
You'll move along
