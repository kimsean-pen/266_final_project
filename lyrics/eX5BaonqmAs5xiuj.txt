I am my deepest shadow
Something I can't ever neglect
Rise above these ashes
Or fall and fade away

In dark moments, I know better
Within destruction, I see clearly

From here to new grounds
Suppose I will be doing it alone
With a smile through black design
Fearless of your conviction

Staring into truth
I'm the highway
Existence, care for me
In all your everlasting complications

In dark moments, I know better
Within destruction, I see clearly

From here to new grounds
Suppose I will be doing it alone
With a smile through black design
Fearless of your conviction

Forget the promised land
There was never an invitation
Today I create my own
Before there was sorrow and lack of attention

From here to new grounds
Suppose I will be doing it alone
With a smile through black design
Fearless of your conviction
