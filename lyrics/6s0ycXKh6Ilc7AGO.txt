Came into the world, to the wild
No place for a child
Used my voice to howl
With the ghouls of night
In the dying light

I had to learn to get what I need
In the dark, empty
Instincts are guiding me
Like a beast to some blood
And I can't get enough

I'm losing control
My body, my soul are slowly fading away
But I'm ready now to feel the power of change

I'm my mother's child
I'm my father's son
It took me a while
But my time has come
To be born again

Running scared in between
What I hate and what I need
Savior and enemy are both trying to take my soul
And I can't hide no more

Stumble out into the light
Raise my fists up to fight
Then I catch your eyes
So full of love
Lord, what have I done?

I cry at your feet,
Wounded for me
And all of the monsters of men
But here in your light, we can begin again

I'm my mother's child
I'm my father's son
It took me a while
But my time has come

I'm my mother's child
I'm my father's son
Lord, took me a while
But my time has come
To be born again

To be born again
