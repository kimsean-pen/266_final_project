I thought saw your face last night
Hoping that could mean something
And I didn't know what to say
So, I was saying nothing

Now, I'm drowning in the bottle and I can't wake
Hoping that you'll come and save me again

I must be dreaming
That I'm the one to take your heart away
I must be dreaming
That I'm the one to take your heart away

Thought I saw your face last night
Laying on a beach of diamonds
And I didn't know what to say
I didn't know that I would feel this

Now I'm drowning in the bottle and I can't wake
Hoping that you'll come and save me again

I must be dreaming
That I'm the one to take your heart away
I must be dreaming
That I'm the one to take your heart away
I must be dreaming
