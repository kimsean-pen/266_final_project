Her mother's mother and her mom
Never had much fun
Took the blood like down in silence
Sit their shame inside their part

She's got the toning in her hear
She needs no blessing, no respect
You come by her favorite???
But you can't give all what you'll get

Huhu...
She's a loveless lad
Huhu...
She's a loveless lad

She will not make you babies
She will make the president

Her mother's mother and her sisters
What they say was of no interest

The whole wars hurt like listeners
You better care for what you ask

She was born to be in passion
Her mother's mother of that way
Hold it back your barricade
And if you will break like sugar glass
You will break like sugar glass

She's a loveless lad
Ahaha...
She's a loveless lad

She will not be miracle man
She will not be a medicine
She cannot share her big name

She will make the president
