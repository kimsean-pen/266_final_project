Ronnie, talk to Russia before it's too late
Before it's too late, before it's too late
Ronnie, talk to Russia before it's too late
Before they blow up the world

You can go to the zoo, but they can't feed guerrillas
Can't feed guerrillas, left wing guerrillas
Go to the zoo, but don't feed guerrillas
Who wanna blow up the world

Oh yes, baby

Ronnie, if you're dead before I get to meet ya
Before I get to meet ya, before I get to meet ya
Ronnie, if you're dead before I get to meet ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

Ronnie, talk to Russia before it's too late
Before it's too late, before it's too late
Ronnie, talk to Russia before it's too late
Before they blow up the world

Before they blow up the world
(Don't blow up my world)
Don't you blow up my world
