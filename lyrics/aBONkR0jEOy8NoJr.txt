One, two, pbblt

I wrote a song on your guitar and it sounds like
You wrote a song on my guitar and it sounds like shit
I'll trace the freckles on your arm and it felt like ooh, ooh, ooh
You held the fabric of my heart and then ripped it

You only like me when I'm sad
You only want me when I'm feelin' bad
You only like me when I'm sad
You only want me when I'm feelin' bad
And now I'm feelin' so bad

I'm watching everybody dance from the safe wall
You try act like you don't care but you're smiling
I'm talkin' this close to your ear 'cause it's way loud
What's all the hype with cold brew coffee and kissin' in public?

You only like me when I'm sad
You only want me when I'm feelin' bad
You only like me when I'm sad
You only want me when I'm feelin' bad
And now I'm feelin' so bad

I'm sad
You only want me when I'm feelin' bad
You only like me when I'm sad
You only want me when I'm feelin' bad
Now I'm feelin' so bad
