It's a new day
Something feels strange
I'm walking in the clouds
I'm almost touching the stars
Anything seems possible, imaginable
Am I dreaming?
All normal things start to change
Can feel no gravity
I step outside the atmosphere
Nothing seems impossible, unreachable
How strange it feels
Moving in slow motion
I guess I must be dreaming
Now, is this real
Or my imagination?
I guess I must be dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
I guess I must be dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
I take a leap
I should be scared, but I'm not
Travelling in the speed of light
Planets are flashing by
Like a shooting star I fly
How strange it feels
Moving in slow motion
I guess I must be dreaming
Now, is this real
Or my imagination?
I guess I must be dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
I guess I must be dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
This is just a dream
This is just a dream
How strange it feels
Moving in slow motion
I guess I must be dreaming
Now, is this real
Or my imagination?
I guess I must be dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
I guess I must be dreaming,
dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
