There you go again with your
First world problems
Where your living is easy
Messing up your mind the daily grind
Gotta leave it all behind
Driving everybody crazy

There you go again with your
First world problems
Where your living is easy
Messing up your mind the daily grind
Gotta leave it all behind
Driving everybody crazy

I, I'm an early riser
Wake up let the sun go to my head
Hey, just hypnotise ya
Walking like your boots are made of lead

There you go again with your
First world problems
Where your living is easy
Messing up your mind the daily grind
Gotta leave it all behind
Driving everybody crazy

There you go again with your
First world problems
Where your living is easy
Messing up your mind the daily grind
Gotta leave it all behind
Driving everybody crazy

I, I'm an easy rider
Watch me as I ride and glide away
Say, still might surprise ya
Disappear come back another day

There you go again with your
First world problems
Where your living is easy
Opening your mouth and making sounds
But there's nothing coming out
Crying like a new born baby

All is a distraction by design
A trick of smoke and
Mirrors to steal your mind
All is an illusion, mired in confusion
Codex Alimentarius

There you go again with your
First world problems
Where your living is easy
Opening your mouth and making sounds
But there's nothing coming out
Driving everybody crazy

There you go again with
Your first world problems
Where your living is easy
Opening your mouth and making sounds
But there's nothing coming out
Driving everybody crazy
Driving everybody crazy
Driving everybody crazy
Hands and knees and whoops-a-daisy
Driving everybody crazy
How do you get so f- lazy?
Driving everybody crazy
Everybody crazy
Crazy
