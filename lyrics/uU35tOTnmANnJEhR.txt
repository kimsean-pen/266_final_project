You need to get up, get out and do something... (Psyche!)
I spend all my time trying to get high
Except during the day, that's when I'm trying to get paid
If I ain't got no green, how the fuck am I supposed to get green?
Rolling the weed, blowing the weed
Yeah, you know
Throat full of smoke, choking on the dro
Bitch, you know I got oodles and oodles of fucking o's and o's
And if I'm really fucking stoned I might give you a loan
I need a zone, meaning I'm zoned the fuck out
Watching my weight, but I'm still gaining pounds
Blowing on loud, that Boom, Bam, Pow
Knock your ass out

All my hittas high, they be puffing on that loud
When I'm on that lean I don't ever make a sound
Ride around town with a pound underground
Get it down don't frown when the cops come around
Smoking and sipping, you know I stay pimping
Got 33 birds like my name was Pippen
They wishing I'm tripping about shit I envision
You got to be kidding about puffing that sticky
You with me?
Well, let me slow it down one time
I'm on their minds, they realize the real lies between thin lines
Bloody red eyes, smoking ounces
I'm, ducking and faded, patiently waiting
These pills that I'm taking, I'm chasing
With 40oz. and vaping
Nothing can save me
That purp got me hazy
I tell her look baby...

All my niggas high
We be puffing on that loud
