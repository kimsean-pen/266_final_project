And all is gone, no more breathe on your frozen lips
And every word now sounds so bitter sweet
You've buried our soul so deep into this lie:
ŤTogether, forever .ť

Your heart is like .

A misery garden full of dead flowers
All joy just fades away
Your jaded soul beg for deliverance
You keep on deny the pain

You blame yourself to enjoy this cold despair
Would you really ask for more if could reverse the time?
A distant voice reverberating into the dark
Makes you remember all the things you've lost

A misery garden full of dead flowers
All joy just fades away
Your jaded soul beg for deliverance
You keep on deny the pain
'Cross my heart and hope to die'
Vermilion River running dry
Drawn on your wrist, a blooming rose
Of blood to celebrate your suffering

Exquisite downfall in your eyes
Welcoming death into your arms
A cold kiss to make you whisper
'Will you be my deadly Valentine?'

A misery garden full of dead flowers
All joy just fades away
Your jaded soul beg for deliverance
You keep on deny the pain
