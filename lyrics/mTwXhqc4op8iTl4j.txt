She caught her flight at 10 A.M.
And checked her face at Amsterdam
Oh, it's just what it's like
When you're only seen at night
She left her love somewhere at home
And now she's dancing on her own
To the kind of disco sound
That makes her glad he's not around

She's looking at you
So maybe you're looking too
Do you want to be her
Or don't you?
Of course you do
But would she be you?

He doesn't dance as good as she
Why don't you save a seat for me
As the sun came and went
From the safety of a jet
He gave Orlando one last look
Then dropped his head inside the book
That he never gets to read
Maybe he'll just get some sleep

She's looking at you
So maybe you're looking too
Do you want to be her
Or don't you?
Of course you do
But would she be you?
