Stealing hearts was your pastime
I saw girls on the hook line
You stole kisses and threw them aside
Hits and misses your love-side

You've changed (oh oh oh oh)
For the better (yeah)
You've changed (oh oh oh oh)
For the better (yeah)

Making waves was your hobby, yeah
And I asked you to hold me
And I knew we will do it all over the way
All is different now I'm your girl
You've changed (oh oh oh oh)

For the better (yeah)
You've changed (oh oh oh oh)
For the better (yeah)
You've changed
For the better (oh)
You've changed (oh oh oh)
For the better

Oh, you know

You've changed (oh oh oh oh)
For the better (yeah)
You've changed (oh oh oh oh)
For the better (yeah)
You've changed
For the better (oh)
You've changed (oh oh oh oh)
For the better
