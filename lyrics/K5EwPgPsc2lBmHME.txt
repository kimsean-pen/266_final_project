The Exodus is on
The impetus is gone
Nobody's having fun
How about another drink
Or maybe just a snack
The rest will be here soon
Here, let me take your mac
I know its started slow
There's still no need to go

Don't leave me alone with her
Every home is Rome alone with her
And if you all go, who'll say no to her
Don't leave me alone with her
Don't my sweat and shaking register
Cause if you all go, who'll say no to her

You look at her and say, "She looks OK to me"
I look at her and say, "She looks OK to me"
The reason's very clear
You're watching her with me

Don't leave me alone with her
Every home is Rome alone with her
And if you all go, who'll say no to her

Unwitting chaperons, how come you cannot see
Unwitting chaperons, how come you cannot see
A Hitler wearing heels
A soft Simon Legree
A Hun with honey skin
De Sade who makes good tea
Don't leave me here to be
Don't leave me here to be?

Don't leave me alone with her, etc.
