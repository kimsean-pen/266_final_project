One sip and I'll be okay
Only aching for your taste
I just gotta get my fix
Love your flavor on my lips

Send your sugar straight into my veins
I crave you
All the time
Let me spend the night and entertain you
Detain you
All night

You can get me up all night
You know exactly what I like
Satisfy my appetite
Promise I'll just take a bite
Do it just the way you like
Satisfy my appetite

Whisper with your sweet tooth
Just a lick and I'm seduced
Mmm...
Got a mouthful on my plate
Wanna savor you all day

Send your sugar straight into my veins
I crave you
All the time
Let me spend the night and entertain you
Detain you
All night

You can get me up all night
You know exactly what I like
Satisfy my appetite
Promise I'll just take a bite
Do it just the way you like
Satisfy my appetite

Promise I'll just take a bite
Do it just the way you like
Satisfy my appetite
