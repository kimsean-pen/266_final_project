Broken glass on the floor by my bed
Lying next to books
I've never even read

Wide awake, all the mess that I made
Everything I've taken
you're the one who paid

Forget what I have done
Sometimes I've lost you
Sometimes I've won

Just let me do
Everything I can
'Cause everything I do is for you

There's a darkness to my shadow on the wall
Everytime I try to stand
That's when I fall

There's a fever burning deep in my bones
Even when I'm with you
I'm on my own

Forget what I have done
Sometimes I've lost you
Sometimes I've won

Just let me do
Everything I can
'Cause everything I do is for you

Mmm, I do it all for you

You're the lighthouse when I'm lost at sea
You're my band-aid when I bleed
Am I hypnotizing you, like you're hypnotizing me

Forget what I have done
Sometimes I've lost you
Sometimes I've won

Just let me do
Everything I can
'Cause everything I do is for you

I do it all for you

Broken glass on the floor by my bed
Lying next to books
I've never even read

Wide awake, all the mess that I made
Everything I've taken
you're the one who paid
