No one wants to talks about the fight we had in June
And when December rolls around,
I won't be next to you
You used all the after pay
And I got no returns
Don't let me stop all your fun
There's lessons to be learned

Call me in the morning
Put me in my place
I did my best to love you
I did my best to stay

The characters we used to play
Are walking off the stage
There's nothing left to organize
All your shit is safe
I picked up these allergies
Somewhere on my own
I'm scratching off my skin again
I rub down to the bone

Call me in the morning
Put me in my place
I did my best to love you
I did my best to stay
I did my best to stay
