I NEVER CAN DECIDE

I fall, I sleep with your heart round my neck
What if I spit the joker from the deck?

I'm anchored down, stuck in this town
What happens if I leave and then I need you back?
Expect you to wait, then I hesitate
I know it's real because you know to compensate
Expect you to wait

You have MY HEART in your hands
I wait and see and you left
You have MY HEART in your hands
I wait and see and you left

I never can decide
I never can decide
I never can decide
I never can decide
I never can decide
I never can decide
I never can decide
I never can decide
I never can decide

Keep it locked up inside, won't let me in
It's stop, stop, high drop
You falter, I just can't win
You say I'm to blame, you want me to change
I probably should but I can't seem to play that game
We twist and turn, I never learn
But lessons never seem to be my main concern

You have MY HEART
You have MY HEART

I had it all figured out
When you came and figured it out
The way you supersede the pessimistic part of me
I had it all figured out
When you came and figured it out
The way you supersede the pessimistic part of me

You have MY HEART in your hands
I wait and see and you left
You have MY HEART in your hands
I wait and see and you left

I never can decide
I never can decide
I never can decide
I never, never, never, never
I never can decide
I never can decide
Never, never, never
Never can decide
I never can decide
I never can decide
I never can decide
I never can decide
I never can decide
I never can decide
I never can decide
