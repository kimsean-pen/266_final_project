Alone again in Paris
Travel drained
I write to you
You've been on my mind
Cold days, long nights

A rooftop in Berlin
I call
Confess the state I'm in
These cities
This view
I see nothing without you

And I can do this alone
But we can do this so much better
Together
Together
Together
Together

I can make it alone
But we can make it so much better
Together
Together
Together
Together

London Bridge
The rain
At last back in these arms again
I'm sorry I hurt you
I hurt me too
Forgive my jealousy
That's not the man I long to be
By your side
My whole life
True love knows no sacrifice

And I can do this alone
But we can do this so much better
Together
Together
Together
Together

I can make it alone
We can make it so much better
Together
Together
Together
Together

Together

I put my arms around your waist
Pull you closer in embrace
I say divided we fall
But stronger we stand
Together
Together
Together
Together
Together
