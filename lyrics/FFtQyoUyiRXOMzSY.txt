Could there be others
Who're spitting blood
Never got too far
Release my hope and fury
Where did it all got wrong?
Where did I come from?

Justify hands of mine giving directions
Choice is always yours in the end

Burning hatred turns to love
Splits like a lie
Would you believe this
Can you reverse these words
That simplify

Justify hands of mine giving directions
Choice is always yours in the end

Rehear me tear my enemies
Want to start this all over again
I know I'm all alone in this penance
At least I know it's all mine

Rehear me tear my enemies
Want to start this all over again
I know I'm all alone in this penance

Could there be others
Who're spitting blood
Never got too far
Release my hope and fury
Where did it all got wrong?
Where did I come from?

Rehear me tear my enemies
Want to start this all over again
I know I'm all alone in this penance
At least I know it's all mine

Rehear me tear my enemies
Want to start this all over again
I know I'm all alone in this penance
