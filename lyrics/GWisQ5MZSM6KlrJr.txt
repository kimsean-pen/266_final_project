When you left the house this evening
You said you'd be back in a little while.
But I've been waiting for such a long time
And this waiting is driving me wild.

And while I wait I think about you
Do you need me and I'm not there?
Are you planning to be without me?
Do you have a new affair?

You're a bad, bad woman.
You're a bad, bad woman.

Pictures of you keep flashing to my mind.
If you would only call
If you would be so kind.
Imagine things, I've seen another man.
And it's this waiting I just can't stand.

You're a bad, bad woman.
You're a bad, bad woman.
You're a bad, bad woman.
You're a bad, bad woman.
