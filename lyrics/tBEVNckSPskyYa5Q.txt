I don't want no Cadillac
(C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C)
The one I got I'm gonna take it back
(C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C)
Come down to my house early in the morning
(C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C)
A look at the car wouldn't give me no warning

Oh, Cadillac

Well I looked in the trunk but there wasn't no jack
(C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C)
I think I'll take this Cadillac back
(C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C)
Oh, Willy and Mary come walking down the street
(C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C)
Looked at the car, makin' fun at me
(C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C)

Oh, Cadillac

I don't want no Cadillac
(C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C)
The one I got I'm gonna take it back
(C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C)
Come down to my house early in the morning
(C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C)
A look at the car wouldn't give me no warning

Oh, Cadillac
Oh, Cadillac, Cadillac, Cadillac
