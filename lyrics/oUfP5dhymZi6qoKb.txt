Lying to myself I can make it on my own
Making it alone is lonely
Twisting and I'm turning
Oh I'm crashing and I'm burning
So reach out your hand to me
Come down
Rescue my heart I'll drown
Without you
Come down
And rescue my heart I'm deep underground
I can't dig my way out
So come down
(Rescue my heart)
(Rescue my heart)

I can't breath any faster
All the air I wanna capture
It's heavy and it hurts my head
If you found me
would you save me?
If you touch me would it break me
Will I come back from this?
Come down
Rescue my heart
I'll drown
Without you
Come down
Rescue my heart I'm deep underground
I can't dig my way out
So come down
Rescue my heart
Rescue my heart
Rescue my heart
Rescue my heart
(Who will rescue my heart?)
(Who will rescue my heart?)
(Who will rescue my heart?)
(Who will rescue my heart?)
(Who?)
Come down
Rescue my heart I'll drown
Without you
Come down
Please rescue my heart I'll drown
Without you
