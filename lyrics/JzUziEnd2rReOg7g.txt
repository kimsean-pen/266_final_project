We scream into the night
It's hopeless every time
But don't you know the way you work for me when things are done
I wanna make it right
'Cause baby it's you and I
So come and look at me again
Now tell me we are done 'cause

I got it all
I got the summer and the winter and the fall
But when you say I'm complicated all the time
Don't you see the worried maiden waiting by your side

Now ooh, stay with me
Now ooh, stay with me

The weather always change
The flowers haven't changed
It's all the spectrum everything I guess I'd rather sing
I know I make you tired
But I love you til' I die
So come and look at me again
Now tell me we are done 'cause

I got it all
I got the summer and the winter and the fall
But when you say I'm complicated all the time
Don't you see the worried maiden waiting by your side

Now ooh, stay with me
Now ooh, stay with me
