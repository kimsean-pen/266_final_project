Sure enough
We cannot stay here forever
So climb aboard
It feels just like when we were young

Breathe in
We belong

Your moves just rip up the sky
Their hearts will spill around us
They will not pull us down
And I'll wait for you there every night

I fall apart
Your arms are my ambulance
Our flesh and bones
It still feels like when we were young
Breathe in
We belong
Your moves just rip up the sky
Their hearts will spill around us
They will not pull us down
And I'll wait for you there every night
