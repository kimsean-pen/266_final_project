The timing doesn't seem right
We've both got broken hearts
But I keep falling for you late night
Is it too soon for this to start?

I've got good intentions
I don't mean to be reckless
We don't have to be selfish

Give me some space, love
I'm coming back
Space, love
I don't need that

We could be broken hearted lovers
You can help me recover
We could be broken hearted lovers
You can help me recover

You showed up at my house last night
We talked about her
And now you're feeling bad today
Well I can help you baby
I think I know what to say now
To get you to stay now
You will never walk away now

Give me some space, love
I'm coming back
Space, love
I don't need that

We could be broken hearted lovers
You can help me recover
We could be broken hearted lovers
You can help me recover

You can help me recover

Give me some space love
I'm coming back
Give me some space, love
Some space, love
I don't need that

We could be broken hearted lovers
You can help me recover
We could be broken hearted lovers
You can help me recover
We could be broken hearted lovers
You can help me recover

You can help me recover
