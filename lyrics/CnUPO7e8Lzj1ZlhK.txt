May I make my fond excuses
For the lateness of the hour
But we accept your invitation
And we bring you Beltane's flower.
For the May Day is the great day
Sung along the old straight track
And those who ancient lines did lay
Will heed the song that calls them back.
Pass the word and pass the lady
Pass the plate to all who hunger.
Pass the wit of ancient wisdom
Pass the cup of crimson wonder.
Pass the cup of crimson wonder.

Ask the green man where he comes from
Ask the cup that fills with red.
Ask the old grey standing stones that
Show the sun its way to bed.
Question all as to their ways
And learn the secrets that they hold.
Walk the lines of nature's palm
Crossed with silver and with gold.
Pass the cup and pass the lady
Pass the plate to all who hunger.
Pass the wit of ancient wisdom
Pass the cup of crimson wonder.

Pass the cup of crimson wonder.

Join in black December's sadness
Lie in August's welcome corn.
Stir the cup that's ever-filling
With the blood of all that's born.
But the May Day is the great day
Sung along the old straight track
And those who ancient lines did lay
Will heed this song that calls them back.
Pass the word and pass the lady
Pass the plate to all who hunger.
Pass the wit of ancient wisdom
Pass the cup of crimson wonder.
Pass the cup of crimson wonder.
