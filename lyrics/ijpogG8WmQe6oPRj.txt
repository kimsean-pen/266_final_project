Black Cats, White Cats
All my Zef Cats, look out
Big dog in the place to be

Pitbull Terrier
I am a Pitbull Terrier
Pitbull Terrier
I am a Pitbull Terrier

Pussy for bad boy
No pussy, sad boy
You're making me crazy
Might learn to scowl, boy
All work and no play make Ninja a dull boy

I'm an animal, love me
I'll kill you, don't fuck me
Your Pitbull, he's crazy
Baby, don't hate me
I'd never leave your side, fuck that
I need to freak 'cause I love that
Berzerk shit, and I worship you

Yeah, Black Cats, White Cats
All my Zef Cats, look out
Big dog in the place to be (oh)
Big dog in the place to be (yo)
Big dog in the place to be
Big dog make you scream

Pitbull Terrier
I am a Pitbull Terrier
Pitbull Terrier
I am a Pitbull Terrier

B-b-b-baby
Here, boy
Are you crazy?
Down, boy
Look at your cross face
Why you so serious?
You so intense
Maybe why I'm so curious

I'm a lost soul, save me
Emotional, sway me
Touch me, shake me
I'm game, play me
Love me, hate me
Kiss me, take me
Break me, make me yours
