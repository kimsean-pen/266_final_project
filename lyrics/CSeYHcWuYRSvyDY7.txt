Take
Out the stories
They've put into your mind
And brace...
For the glory
As you stare into the sky.
The sky beneath

I know you can't be tired
Lay there
Stare at the ceiling
And switch back to your time...
Just go ahead!
Now try and taste it...
I know it should be ripe...

Thrust...
Ahead
Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival
Cut to the end

I'd like to be taken
Apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle...
right to the end.

I wonder...
just how you shaped it?
To get back to your prize
Thrust...
Ahead!

Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis

The ancient arrival
Cut to the end
I'd like to be taken
Apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle...
right to the end.

Wake for the glory
I know you can't be...
TIRED!
Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival
Cut to the end
I'd like you to take me...
Apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle...
Right to the end
Inside... inside... inside
Turning in circles
{inside} Been caught in a stasis
{inside} I want you to take me...
{inside} apart from the inside
Right to the end.
