Ayy, yeah, ayy, yeah
You know, I want a motherfucking
A motherfucking astronaut chain
With a Gatorade on that bitch

White coupe, butter pecan
Thick bitch, Puerto Rican
Take you out to Paraguay
Or California for the weekend
I'm with Sak and Juvy
So you gotta bring about three friends
Don't flex, don't pretend
You know we spin a bend

Fifty thousand dollar advance in my account, huh
Running up them bands with my mans and that's how we
Gotta get these racks 'cause I can and we
YNW's a family
I might just cop a Rolex or Cuban link
I been going through some things
I wanted you to see if
You could maintain this lifestyle that I live
'Cause I am you and you are me 'til the very end
I just want a Cuban link
Wash away all of the pain
Mixing molly with the apple juice
I don't do that no more, who the hell are you?
Smoking on that Cranberry Kush weed
Wash away all of the pain
Mixing molly with the apple juice
I don't do that no more, who the hell are you?

Just in case you need it, I got you (I got you)
We taking off like a rocket (Rocket)

But bitch, I'm the Reaper, she ain't a keeper
I'm creeping in a Jeep but I am not Jeepers Creepers, and yes I
