I swore I heard you laughing with me
On the couch at my house
And I remember how you said
You're my best friend
But I don't think I'll feel that way again
But those are my favorite parts
Saying that you hate me
Tearing me apart

Take out my spine
Use it to hang me from the phone lines
Take in the view of you
To see you happy when I'm feeling blue
I'm turning blue

I never had the guts to say
That I wish you wouldn't laugh
When I spill them that way
I never had the guts to say
That I'm really upset about it

It's not that you won't be happy again
You just won't be the same as you were before

I hate (I hate)
The way that things just don't feel the same (the way)
Like you'll never laugh again (you say)
At least not that way
I'll be okay
Someday
I'll be happy again
