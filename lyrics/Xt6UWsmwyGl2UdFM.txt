I'm the desert sun
The ever endless sea
Not a drop of blue or white
It's where it shouldn't be
I'm a wheel going round
In a mirror house
I made no way out
But you have feels about

Holding on
To everything has come and gone
I need distraction
Gimme a form in between (?)
Everything I've ever seen
Don't be long
I'm no beginner
I'll be here every night
My name up in lights

The impossible winner

I'm the wilderness
Dark end of the street
Coast of infinity
Far as I can see

I'm a white noise son
Thorn upon the form
But when that whips around
No part of any storm

Holding on
To everything that has come and gone
I need distraction
Gimme a form in between (?)
Everything I've ever seen
Don't be long
I'm no beginner
I'll be here every night
My name up in lights

The impossible winner
The impossible winner
The impossible winner

Drag my body through the sand
Drag my body down the road
Drag me up to the air
Turn around
Here I'm
Drag me down, down low
Down, down small
Makes no difference
Turn around
Here I'm

Holding on
To everything has come and gone
I need distraction
Gimme a form in between (?)
Everything I've ever seen
Don't be long
I'm no beginner
I'll be here every night
My name up in lights

The impossible winner
The impossible winner
The impossible winner
