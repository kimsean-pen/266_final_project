Alone but moving
All I really needed
Alone but moving
Good enough for me

It's easier to witness
A crowd from up above
It's the movement of labor,
It's the labor of love

Alone but moving
All I really needed
Alone but moving
Good enough for me

Only one way to figure
Carve it out of stone
A roof that won't open
Is never gonna be my home

Some need static
A built up charge
But I need lightening
From that world at large

Alone but moving
All I really needed
Alone but moving
Good enough for me

Alone but moving
All I really needed
Alone but moving
Only place to be
