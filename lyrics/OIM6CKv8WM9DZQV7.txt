(Phillips, Lee, Huffsteter)

One day I was walking to school
I saw these bullies and
They thought they were cool
They put me down and they pushed me around
They stole my books and they called me a clown

Give It Back
Baaaaccckk
Give It Back
You better give it back

I went to school
yeah I went anyway
I said I'd show them another day
I brought my mom and my daddy too
I got 'em thrown right out of school

I got em back
Baaack
Yeah I Got em Back
You Know I got em back
Ba ba ba back

(Break)

That night I was walking home
and when they got me I was all alone
A bloody nose and a broken bone
I thought those brats were going to leave me alone
