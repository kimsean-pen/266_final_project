Went unto this country
With a waking eye
Oh the spark was on my neck,
Was in my eye, eye

Went unto this substance
At the river edge
Oh the was pulled back up
Into the sky

how time did fly for you
oh.

once I lost my brother
in the blink of an eye
oh the wind was spawning
held me up the while

want to kiss and steal
want to drink and bend
oh pull me up beyond the river edge

how time did fly for you
oh.
