Let's get some
I can feel your body just take,
something's gonna happen when you just move
Biting your tongue for the taste, pulling on my shirt just move
Hot light blood to the mood, I could feel your eyes just prove
Ask for The Anthem and I'll prove, ask for The Anthem and I'll prove

I could follow like you do, all you gotta do is say
You don't wanna be the one to lose, never gonna hear me say
Hair drops back to the room, I can feel your eyes just prove
Ask for The Anthem and I'll prove, ask for The Anthem and I'll prove

So just play it back,
if I hear just that, then we'll both be better off, you know?
Just say something back. If I hear my track,
then we'll both be better off, now. We'll both be better off, no?
If I forget how. If I forget how.
Put that song on, show you what it is now
Ask for it now. Ask for it now. Put The Anthem on, put The Anthem on
Let's get some
(Boy, if I want it I'll ask you for it)

Every word's a gift to the bass,
something's gonna happen when you just move
I can feel the sin in your skin. Lift it to my lips, just prove
Disc slips tight in the groove. Heads turn back to the room
Ask for The Anthem and I'll prove. Ask for The Anthem and I'll prove

So just play it back,
if I hear just that, then we'll both be better off, you know?
Just say something back. If I hear my track,
then we'll both be better off, now. We'll both be better off, no?
If I forget how. If I forget how.
Put that song on, show you what it is now
Ask for it now. Ask for it now. Put The Anthem on, put The Anthem on

Ask for it. The Anthem. You should ask for it. The Anthem
Ask for it. The Anthem. You should ask for it. The Anthem

Supermodels, fast cars, origami superstars
Snow days, roof tops, fireworks, I gotta stop
Riding down the Eurostar with ten pounds and Opal card
Camden town looking real hard
My Thunderdome, come as you are
(Boy, if I want it I'll ask you for it)
