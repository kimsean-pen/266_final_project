And I say, Just go.
Please, Dave, just drive.
Get us as far as far can be.
Get us away from tonight.
And I say, Oh, Dave, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell,
But I'm having a bad week
And I miss my mom.

We drive
Dave steps on the gas
The world that's flying by is slick and smooth
Big waves of light
The radio is playing Queen
We're rocking out

And we're going now
'Cause, hey, this is it
This is where we are
Out here where silence is
Seventy miles an hour, windows up tight
And I am home.

We drive
Dave steps on the gas
The world that's flying by is slick and smooth
Big waves of light
The radio is playing Queen
We're rocking out

We drive
Dave steps on the gas
The world that's flying by is slick and smooth
Big waves of light
The radio is playing Queen
We're rocking out
