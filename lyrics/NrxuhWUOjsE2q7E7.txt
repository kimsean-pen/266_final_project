I look at her in that paper dress
I wonder why she won't burn
She's just a paperdoll, that's all
Just a paperdoll

I dress her up, she knocks me down
I dress her up, she knocks me down

They try her on for size
She fits nice, one size fits all
They try her on for size
She fits nice, one size fits all

Now her soul is dead
Now her body's raw
You can numb her pain

Watch the blood run down her face
But don't take notice
Watch the blood run down her arms
Please don't take notice

I know you have her soul
And I see it in your eyes
She knows you have her soul
And she sees it in your eyes

Now her soul is dead
Now her body's raw
You can numb her pain

She wants you to eat her pain
She wants you to eat her remains
She wants you to eat her pain
She wants you to eat her remains
