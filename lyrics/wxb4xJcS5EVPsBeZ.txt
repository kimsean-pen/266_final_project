Want you, need you
It's the call of the wild
Something animal, more than physical
Satisfy me cos I'm falling apart
Synchronicity in our chemistry

I'm a woman
Not a siren calling
It's only natural
For me to want your loving

When you gonna look me up
Don't say never ever
Just need you to hook me up
I don't need forever
When you gonna put me up
Don't say never ever
Just need you to fix me up
I don't need forever

Want you, need you
It's the call of the wild
Something animal, more than physical
Satisfy me cos I'm falling apart
Synchronicity in our chemistry

I'm a woman
Not a siren calling
It's only natural
For me to want your loving

When you gonna look me up
Don't say never ever

Just need you to hook me up
I don't need forever
When you gonna put me up
Don't say never ever
Just need you to fix me up
I don't need forever

Call, call, call, call of the wild, wild
Call, call, call, call make you mine, mine

Tick, tock, ten to one
Tick, tock, ten to one
Tick, tock, ten to one
It's a little of the night but I've just begun
Tick tock, ten to two
And I'm getting kind of hungry so I'm after you
Tick tock, ten to three
And I've gotta funny feeling coming over me
Tick tock, ten to four
It's the call of the wild and I'm calling for more

Call, call, call, call of the wild, wild
Call, call, call, call make you mine, mine

Call, call, call, call of the wild, wild
Call, call, call, call make you mine, mine

Mine, mine
Mine, mine
