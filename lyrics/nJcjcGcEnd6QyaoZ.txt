She makes me smile
She thinks the way I think
That girl, makes me wanna be better

Took her down Bleecker Street
So she drank the way I drink
I kissed the sky
To send a bluer letter

That girl, makes me wanna be
A better man
Yeah and should she see fit
Gonna treat her like a real man can

She's fearless, she's free
Oh she is a real live-wire
And that girl
She's got me feeling so much better

Hmmm, should trade all the money in the world, eh
Just to see this girl smile
All the while she'll make you
Feel so much better

Oh, that girl makes me wanna be
A better man
And should she see fit
Gonna treat her like a real man can

Ahhh, ahh, ahhh
Ahhh, ahh, ahhhh (Ahhhh, laaaa, la, la) Ahhh, ahh, ahhhhh
Ahhh, ahh, ahhhhh
(Oh make me feel all right) Ahhh, ahh, ahhhhh
(Oh make me feel all right) Ahhh, ahh, ahhhhh

Oh I might get eager
I might lose my cool
Feel like I'm in detention
In office at the school

And you'll either love me
Or you'll hate me
'Cause I can see you got
No time for the in-between
But the reflection in your eyes
Gonna look so much better

I said, that girl, makes me wanna be
A better man
Yeah, yeah, and if she sees fit
Gonna treat her like a real man can

I'm gonna treat her like a real man can
Oh
Gonna treat her like a real man can
Yeah
Gonna treat her like a real man can
Ohhh
