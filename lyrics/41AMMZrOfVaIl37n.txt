We felt a change in times sometimes and after
It wasn't really clear at first
The gentry men were also wonder admire
The fancy people were the same

Take a look
The only thing is that the numbers don't add up
Late from work
It's just a typical thing in which you're new to comply

The might is bearing on the wretch

For working class the joy of drinking prevails
The clubs are open never closed
Take a guess
The only thing is that the guesser is a mess
Walk on by
It's just a difficult time in which the people comply

It's a difficult time
Put your hands on the wall
Take a look at the scene that you conceive as paradise
Then just close your eyes
Find your way

It's a typical time, periodical signs
Take a gamble and make a little bet on paradise
So open your eyes
Guess the way

To move a problem is to stay out of harm
Although the worry isn't gone
The working man is feeling under the weather
The passing woman even worse

Take a look
The only thing is that the numbers don't have worth
Walk on by
It's just the seminal time
It's such a terrible plight
Take a guess
The only thing is that the guesser is a mess
Walk on by
It's just a difficult time in which the people comply

It's a difficult time
Put yours hands on the wall
Take a look at the scene then you conceive as paradise
Then just close your eyes
Find your way

It's a typical time, periodical signs
Take a gamble and make a little bet on paradise
So open your eyes
Guess the way
