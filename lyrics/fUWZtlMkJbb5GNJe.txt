Driving down the boulevard
She pulls up in her daddy's car, top down
She's got friends and I've got mine
But I got nothing on my mind
Rockin' out to my favorite songs
That's all I really need
Would it be better if you rolled with me?

We've got the words if you've got the melody
We've got the time if you've got the place to be
And we're not gonna stop
Until we set it off
We've got tonight to make every memory
Ready or not, 'cause we're gonna make you see
We're not gonna stop

We've got the words if you've got the melody
We've got the time if you've got the place to be
And we're not gonna stop
We're gonna set this party off

We're gonna set this party off

She looked at me like I was so (crazy)
I could tell she was like
She didn't say no (right away)
She told that she would think about it
Girls like you that you gotta keep it guessing
And then she blasted her favorite song
But I still heard her scream
Ready, here we go, with me

We've got the words if you've got the melody
We've got the time if you've got the place to be
And we're not gonna stop
Until we set it off
We've got tonight to make every memory
Ready or not, 'cause we're gonna make you see
We're not gonna stop

We've got the words if you've got the melody
We've got the time if you've got the place to be
And we're not gonna stop
We're gonna set this party off

All I need is my favorite song
But it sounds better when you sing along
Sing along

We've got the words if you've got the melody
We've got the time if you've got the place to be
And we're not gonna stop
Until we set it off
We've got tonight to make every memory
Ready or not, 'cause we're gonna make you see
We're not gonna stop

We've got the words if you've got the melody
We've got the time if you've got the place to be
And we're not gonna stop
We're gonna set this party off

We've got the words if you've got the melody (wohow wohow)
We've got the time if you've got the place to be (the place to be)
We've got tonight to make every memory (wohow wohow)
No, we're not gonna stop
We're gonna set this party off
