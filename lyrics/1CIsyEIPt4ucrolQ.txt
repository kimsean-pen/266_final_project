There you go
Flashing fever from your eyes
Hey baby, come over here and shut them tight
I'm not denying
We're flying above it all
Hold my hand, don't let me fall
You've such amazing grace
I've never felt this way

Oh, show me heaven
Cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh, show me heaven please

Here I go
I'm shaking just like the breeze
Hey baby, I need your hand to steady me
I'm not denying
I'm frightened as much as you
Though I'm barely touching you
I've shivers down my spine
And it feels divine

Oh, show me heaven
Cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh, show me heaven please

If you know what it's like
To dream a dream
Baby, hold me tight and let this be, oh

Heaven
Cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh, show me heaven please
Leave me breathless
Leave me breathless
Cover me
Oh, yeah
Leave me breathless
Oh
