I'll be walking up streams
for how long I can't recall
It seems like I never
would run of bad luck

I never thought that I would get these thoughts
And the sands are running low
I would get dazed to kill my haze
And now there's no return

It starts to feel like I'm lost
in this confusion
I tried so hard but I know now
that I can't get out
that I can't get out

All my thoughts were trapped
in downward spirals
Shutting off my feelings
And now they're gone forever

Every time I try to focus
I'll wind up somewhere else
My head won't stop spinning
And my mind is covered in haze

It starts to feel like I'm lost
in this confusion
I tried so hard but I know now
that I can't get out
that I can't get out

It starts to feel like I'm lost
in this confusion
I tried so hard but I know now
that I can't get out
that I can't get out
