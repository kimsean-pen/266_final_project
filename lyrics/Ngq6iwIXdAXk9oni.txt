Built in the belly of junk by the river my cabin stands
Made from the trash I dug out the heap, with my own fair hands
Every night, I'm back at the shack and I'm sure no one else is there
I'm putting the aerial up, so I can go out on the air

(On the air)
On the air
(On the air)
On the air
On the air

Every morning I'm out at dawn with the dwarfs and the tramp
For a silent communion lit from above by the sodium lamps
Everyone I meet on the street acts as if I wasn't there
But they're all going to know who I am 'cos I can go out on the air

(On the air)
On the air
(On the air)
On the air
On the air

Leaving the car down leafy lane
Turning out Tarzan for my Jungle Jane
Anyone at all
From Captain Zero and his brand of superhero standing by a call
Oh it's not easy
No, no, no, no
No it's not easy
Making real friends

Don't give me your steak-reared milkboys, milkboys
Half alive on empty white noise, white noise
I got power, I'm proud to be loud; my signal goes out clear
I want everybody to know that Mozo is here

(On the air)
On the air
(On the air)
On the air
On the air

On the air
On the air
