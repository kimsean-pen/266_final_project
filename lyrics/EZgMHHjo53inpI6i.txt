Seething sounds seeping through
Breaking down the walls, suffocating your creation

The lacquer of the tongue paints the town red
Just like the spider weaves its own web
In shades that grow ever deeper and deeper
The strongest roots are of passion

Breaching the cages of your own mind
Baptizing yourself in the fervor of the light
Lost within the fen of shadows no longer
No longer seeing the demise
With scarlet intensity in the eyes

Seething sounds seeping through
Breaking down the walls, suffocating your creation

The lacquer of the tongue paints the town red
Just like the spider weaves its own web
In shades that grow ever deeper and deeper
The strongest roots are of passion

Swarming inside the purest of hearts
Surrounded by these hallowed grounds
Lost within the fen of shadows no longer
No longer seeing the demise
With scarlet intensity in the eyes

Seething sounds seeping through
Breaking down the walls, suffocating your creation
