So many tried before
And I've waited patiently
In the end it's always wrong
It's so hard for me to believe
That you can keep it goin'
Couldn't stop if I wanted to
So baby if you take my hand
Everyday can feel brand new
Even when we disagree
Ain't no need to get loud
Everything is worth a kiss
Baby that's what I'm talkin' bout
