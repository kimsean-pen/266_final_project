I just keep being tired
I've been sleeping through my days
And I just can't get up now
No, I can't get to work now
I'm in the darkness
It's beyond me

And I feel like I'm dreaming
In a dream on repeat
And the more I try to see it
The more I'll recede
Into the darkness
Beyond me

Peace of mind
Come quickly
Peace of mind
Before the lightning strikes me down
And the thunder rolls me out into the distant sky

Sometimes it gets so hard
That it makes my body shake
And sometimes it gets so hard
That it's more than I can take
Here in the darkness
Believe me

And the more I dressed up
But there's no way to go
And I'm standing at the station
But the whistle won't blow
I'm in the darkness
Believe me

Peace of mind
Come quickly
Peace of mind
Before the lightning strikes me down
And the thunder rolls me out into the distance
Peace of mind
Come quickly
Peace of mind
Before the lightning strikes me down
And the thunder rolls me out into
The distant sky
