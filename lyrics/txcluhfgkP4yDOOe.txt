Slow inside I take my time
will come and fill the empty space
my wound I'll nurse I'll understand
my pain one day will disappear

The land beyond is deep within
I took the path & I cannot go back
I've just connected myself with I
but I don't know me that well as you see

cover the distance
find my world

I walk inside to the heart of my kingdom
climb up a mountain and stand on the top of it
I am the king and I am the servant
follow the rules of loving mighty power
