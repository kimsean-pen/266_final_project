Who did the decorating?
Who hung up your words?
And who's not worried what I didn't say?
Who did the decorating?
What happened to the traces today?
When you know you know, well I don't
I'm tied by the way of church keys, missed weddings
I'm tied by the way everyone talks about everything
I'm breathing easy
I'm breathing sharp
I'm all sand and heat
I'm keeping you
I leave nothing behind but traces for myself to find
I picked the new
I chose the rust
I'm keeping you
The way we'd choose a perfume
Sweet, but not quite right
A haunting air
Some sound advice still left to find
I'm tied by the way of church keys, missed weddings
I'm tied by the way everyone talks about everything
