Things just won't work out that's what I keep telling myself
I'll turn down any good thing that's ever offered to me (offered to me)
Because I know I won't deserve it.
How could I deserve it?
When everything I've ever done,
fell short and leaves me spun back into my
crippling doubt, that'll ever feel good about myself
Because nothing ever works out the way I imagined it.
I just want to be out of this rut I've
been stuck in for over ten fucking years

I want to know what's wrong with me.
What exactly caused this lack of human compatibility?
It still makes me weak at the knees when I think of how I
still haven't found the love I've been trying so hard to reach

With all the self-deprecation I wear on my sleeve,
or the cries for help that make people leave,
just shows that I'm too fucking weak to
keep holding on to this pathetic life I lead

What a waste I chase, I've come this far.
I break away, I break apart.
If I could shake the way I made this
start, would I have a change of heart? (Would I have a change of heart? Would I have a change of heart)

Because nothing ever works out the way I imagined it.
I just want to be out of this rut I've
been stuck in for over ten fucking years.
Ten fucking years, but I know you don't care
