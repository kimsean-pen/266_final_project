Too many puppies are being shot in the dark.
too many puppies are trained not to bark.
at the sight of blood that must be spilled so that we may maintain
our oil fields.
too many puppies.
too many puppies.
too many puppies are taught to heal.
too many puppies are trained to kill.
on the command of men wearing money belts that buy mistresses
sleek animal pelts.
too many puppies.
too many puppies.
too many puppies.
too many puppies.
skinny was born in a bathtub
and he grew so increadably thin
even the tide from the eyedropper sucked him in
skinny never knew any questions
skinny never looked alike
skinny sold somethin every single night
skinny sold a soldier to me
skinny sold the wife
skinny sold a suction cup and a knife
skinny found a hello dolly record in the house.
sold it to a truck driver in the night.
too many puppies with guns in their hands.
too many puppies in foreign lands.
are dressed up sharp in suits of green and placed upon the war
machine.
too many puppies are just like me.
too many puppies are afraid to see.
the visions of the past brought to life again,
too many puppies, too many dead men.
