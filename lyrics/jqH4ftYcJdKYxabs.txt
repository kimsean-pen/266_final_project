Better shut your eyes
Here I come
It's gonna be a wild ride
Wake the dead
Gonna go all night
Twist it up
We're gonna have a good time
These wicked games that we play
These wicked games that we play
These wicked games that we play
These wicked games that we play
Kill the lights
Better hold on tight
Out for blood
Better run and hide
Feel the dark creeping up on you
Better say your prayers before I make my move
These wicked games that we play
These wicked games that we play
These wicked games that we play
These wicked games that we play
These wicked games that we play
These wicked games that we play
These wicked games that we play
These wicked games that we play
