Got a pinch of tobacco in my pocket
I'm not gonna roll it no
I'm not gonna smoke it till
we're staring at the stars and the
rockets twinkling in the silvery night
two sips of whiskey in the flask but I'm not gonna drink em
I swear I'll make it last till we're
drinking out of the same glass again

And though the sand may be washed by the sea
and the old will be lost in the new
well four will not wait for three
for three never waited for two
and though you will not wait for me
I'll wait for you

Got a polaroid picture in my wallet
I'm not gonna tear it no I'm not gonna spoil it
it's an unspoken heartbreak a
heartbroken handshake I'll take with me where I go

Three words on the tip of my tongue not to be spoken
or sung or whispered to anyone till I
scream em at the top of my lungs again

And though the sand may be washed by the sea
and the old will be lost in the new
well four will not wait for three
for three never waited for two
and though you will not wait for me
I'll wait for you

Ohhh and ohhhh
I'll wait for you
ohhhhh
and I'll wait for you
ohhhhh

Got a pinch of tobacco in my pocket
I'm not gonna roll it no I'm not gonna smoke it till we're
staring at the stars and the rockets twinkling in the silvery night
