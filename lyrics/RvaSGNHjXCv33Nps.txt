Shimmering, shimmering
Trembling, flickering
We never turn the lights on, lights on
And we never take a look
Shivering, shivering
The heathen zombies waiting to rise up, rise up
I can never take it back

And serve myself into a tragic memory
That the taste in your mouth
Oh bitter sweet
Hold your head up
I'll still be your shoulder
If you feel down you can lean on me
Hold your head up
I'll still be your shoulder
If you feel down you can lean on me

Lean on me

Crawling on the ground
Hoping that I will be found
Waiting for the fire to spark off
Only wondering through the dark

Turn myself into a tragic memory
Left the taste in your mouth
Oh bitter sweet

Hold your head up
I'll still be your shoulder
If you feel down you can lean on me
Hold your head up
I'll still be your shoulder
If you feel down you can lean on me

Don't look back, don't look back
Tomorrow will start off a new day
A new day
Don't be sad, don't be sad
You will be soon on your lane
Heading for a new day
(Heading for a new day)

Hold your head up
I'll still be your shoulder
If you feel down you can lean on me
Hold your head up
I'll still be your shoulder
If you feel down you can lean on me

Hold your head up
I'll still be your shoulder
If you feel down you can lean on me
Hold your head up
I'll still be your shoulder
If you feel down you can lean on me
