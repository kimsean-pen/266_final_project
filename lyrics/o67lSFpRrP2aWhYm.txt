Alright, this song, it's on
This is how I wrote it
You hear a car speeding
And you hear it skid
And then you hear a crash
And there's flames and shit
You know what I'm saying
What the fuck!
And then you hear footsteps
Put the keys down
And the filter comes over the beat
And it swerves

I crashed your Corvette
I heard you bitchin'
Are you done yet?
I didn't mean to
I wasn't drinking
But I talked to your ex
They say that you've been affectionate

Fuck it
You're lucky I didn't roll it
You're lucky I didn't blow your brains out
Fuck it
Remember back when I told ya
That I'm a loca Colombiana (Yo te lo dije)
Fuck it
Roses and whiskey
I bet that you'll miss me, no doubt
Fuck it
You're lucky I didn't roll it
You're lucky I didn't blow your brains out
(Brains out)

Off with your head
All in my daydreams
Always seeing red
But I showed you mercy
I crashed your Corvette
But I think it was fair
Player, this is your cross to bear

Fuck it
You're lucky I didn't roll it
You're lucky I didn't blow your brains out
Fuck it
Remember back when I told ya
That I'm a loca Colombiana (Yo te lo dije)
Fuck it
Roses and whiskey
I bet that you'll miss me, no doubt
Fuck it
You're lucky I didn't roll it
You're lucky I didn't blow your brains out
(Brains out)
