Nothing changes
It only gets worse
Nothing changes
Waiting for a hearse
There is no hope
Escape is a hoax
The pressure's building
And I just can't cope

Now and forever

Nothing changes
It only gets worse
Nothing changes
Waiting for a hearse
There is no hope
Escape is a hoax
And we're the punchline
To a Splengler's joke

Now and forever

Nothing changes...
