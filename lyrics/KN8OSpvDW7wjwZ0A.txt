Talking about our life, no matter how much I don't like
Talk is never cheap between you and me
Look at how far we've come and still we always come undone
Maybe that's how it always has to be

I'm out here alone, talking on the phone
Tensions are rising, it's never surprising
This is the way it goes
Maybe we'll fall in love when I get home

Talking about our life, seems like we never get it right
But we always get an A for effort
We sweat to find what to say, communication's the only way
If we ever hope to stay together, communicate

I'm out here alone, talking on the phone
Tensions are rising, it's never surprising
This is the way it goes
Maybe we'll fall in love when I get home

Tell me the problem, I wanna know
If there's a solution, I'll fix it now
And if there isn't, I'll just be there
If I don't say something, don't say I don't care

Well, I go yaddadda-yadda-ya
And you go yaddadda-yadda-ya
Yaddadda-yadda-yadda
That's what we gotta do

I'm out here alone, talking on the phone
Tensions are rising, it's never surprising
This is the way it goes
Maybe we'll fall in love when I get home

Maybe we'll fall in love
When I get home
I said, maybe we'll fall in love
When I get home
