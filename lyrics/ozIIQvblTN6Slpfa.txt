For all your ruminations on strength and purpose
There's only dust collecting
In a mind where none can find you
You've shown a wealth of disease

A hand that's broken in fractions
A face that's masked in decay
With no body to call his own now
He's turning inward

I, I've lost faith
There's only ugliness here
Only death can find me
So we know that nothing's true

In all your life there's deception
That somewhere truth can be found
In a house where faith has failed you
There is no use in defending

A hand that's broken in fractions
A face that's masked in decay
With no body to call his own now
He's turning inward

I, I've lost faith
There's only ugliness here
Only death can find me
So we know that nothing's true
We knew another way
To live beyond our despair
You're gone, we're here
So we know that death is real

And we know that death is real

Thoughts of delusion behind stagnant cold eyes
Faces masked inside a house decayed and twisting
All around me are the plastic holy relics
They remind me of my vibrance, gone

Only death can find me
