Let me come alive
Get a few things off my mind
Got a few things on my mind

Little Gemini
You got a lot of alone time
Got a lot of lonely time

You got me at your fingertips, intertwined
You got me at your fingertips, I don't mind
'Cause you are like the puppeteer
Whisper words into my ear
You got me at your fingertips, I'm yours

Leave me unconfined
I see the eyes you hide behind
Don't be the one I leave behind

Little Gemini
We are breathing silently
We are dreaming finally

You got me at your fingertips, intertwined
You got me at your fingertips, I don't mind
'Cause you are like the puppeteer
Whisper words into my ear
You got me at your fingertips, I'm yours

Little Gemini
With eyes you hide behind
While a lookalike is worn

Little Gemini
Let me come alive
I'm no lookalike, I'm yours

Little Gemini
Let me come alive
Little Gemini, I'm yours, I'm yours
