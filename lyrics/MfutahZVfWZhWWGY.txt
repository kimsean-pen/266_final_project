Moonlight on Vermont affected everybody
Even Mrs. Wooten, well, as little Nitty
Even lifebuoy floatin'
With his lil' pistol showin'
With his lil' pistol Totin'

Well, that goes to show you what, uh, moon can do
No more bridge from Tuesday to Friday
Everybody's gone high society
Hope lost his head and got off on alligators

Somebody's leavin' peanuts on the curbings
For, uh, white elephant escaped from zoo with love
Goes to show what, uh, moon can do

Moonlight on Vermont
Well, it did it for Lifebuoy
And it did it t' you
And it did it t' zoo
And it can do it for me
And it can do it for you

Moonlight on Vermont
Gimme dat ole time religion
Gimme dat ole time religion
Don't gimme no affliction

Dat ole time religion is good enough for me
And it's good enough for you
Well, come out to show dem

Come out to show dem
Come out to show dem
Come out to show dem
Come out to show dem
Come out to show dem
Come out to show dem

Gimme dat ole time religion
Gimme dat ole time religion
Gimme dat ole time religion
It's good enough for me

Without yer new affliction
Don't need yer new restrictions
Gimme dat ole time religion
It's good enough for me
