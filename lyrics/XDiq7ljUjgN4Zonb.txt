When I'm driving in my car
And the man come on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Tryin' mess my imagination

When I'm watchin' my TV
And a man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts can be
But he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me

When I'm riding around the globe
And I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that
And I'm tryin' to make some boy
Baby, baby, baby, come back
'Can't you see I'm on a losin' streak?

When I'm riding around the globe
And I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that
And I'm tryin'
And I'm tryin'
