i feel greater then the sum of all my parts
a domestic beast with a hairy heart
trapped within a walled suburbia
i found my taste is somewhat underground
between the shadows and the cracks
i'm building my utopia

i need to beak free from all that binds
that makes me old before my time
in this world of dystopia
my love is like a bright guiding light
shining in the darkness of the night
the star of my utopia

in the motion of the sea
in the air that we breathe
can you feel me?
in the stars and in the trees
in the song of the bees
can you hear me?

caged golden memories
time has come to show your true feelings
i know it's the only way to be
when the same old feelings come over me

i feel greater then the sum of all my parts
a space jockey from a distant star
marooned upon dystopia
i found my taste is somewhat underground
between the shadows and the cracks
i'm building my utopia
