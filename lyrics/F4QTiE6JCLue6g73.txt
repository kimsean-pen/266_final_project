I don't want you to come 'round here no more
I beg you for mercy
You don't know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me
When you say it's over with her
I want to believe it's true
So I let you in knowin' tomorrow
I'm gonna wake up missin' you
Wake up missin' you

When the one you love's in love
With someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a livin' hell

No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control
One look in your blue eyes and suddenly
My heart can't tell you no

I don't want you to call me up no more
Sayin' you need me
You're crazy if you think just half your love
Could ever please me

But still I want to hold you, touch you
When you look at me that way
There's only one solution I know of
You've got to stay away from me
Stay away from me

When the one you love's in love
With someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a livin' hell

No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control
One look in your sad eyes and suddenly
My heart can't tell you no, my heart can't tell you no

I don't want you to come 'round here no more
I beg you for mercy

When the one you love's in love
With someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a livin' hell

When the one you love's in love
With someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a livin' hell, livIn' hell

When the one you love's in love
With someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a livin' hell
