When you wake at the edge of the day
Time isn't real, you can throw it away
Tap into me when there's nothing to see
Could you relay what you said to me?

If you need a way, would you let me in?
Leave them behind for an empty island

Right on the ground
That could never be found
Give it a try
And discover love

What does it mean if there's nothing to see
I cut away what she said to me

If we need a way would you let me in?
Leave them behind for an empty island

It can never end if we don't begin
Leaving a sigh on an empty island
