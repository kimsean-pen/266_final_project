When I get loaded, I gotta go off!

Don't call it a safety
Don't call it half-cocked

It's more like an ashcan
It's more like a time bomb
Its more like a stovepipe
Colombian Necktie!

I don't wanna die
So I can give her the works

Don't call it a safety
Don't call it a ripcord!

It's more like an ashcan
More like a time bomb
More like a stovepipe
Colombian Necktie!

I don't wanna die
So I can give her the works

When I get loaded, gotta go off!

Don't call it a safety
Don't call it half-cocked

More like an ashcan
More like a time bomb
More like a stovepipe
Colombian Necktie!
