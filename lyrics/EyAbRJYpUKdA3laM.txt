Her eyes look cold, I see hate
This blade sunk deep inside your wrist
It's not worth fighting, just resist
With a knife, a thought so sincere
Five times the pain so make it last
Don't walk away, don't walk so fast

Well, I think I've lost my mind now
I know we've lost control
But now we've got the time

We're going nowhere fast
Can you wake up from this world of ours?
It's so cold tonight
We're going nowhere fast
Can you wake up, wake up?
Let's burn this whole place to the ground

You look so good, those black eyes
I know that now I've missed the boat
And helped in cutting my own throat
Well, I've found the cure
Well, I've found what's holding us
Hold on tightly, oh so dear

Well, I think I've lost my mind now
I know we've lost control
But now we've got the time

We're going nowhere fast
Can you wake up from this world of ours?
It's so cold tonight
We're going nowhere fast
Can you wake up, wake up?
Let's burn this whole place to the ground

We're going nowhere fast
Can you wake up from this world of ours?
It's so cold tonight
We're going nowhere fast
Can you wake up, wake up?
Let's burn this whole place to the ground

So now, what's next, you let the fire, set you free
I know, you're already dead but you promised me
Let's light, this world, we'll meet in the afterlife
Let's light, this world, it's so cold tonight
All you need is fire and a friend to wish you well
Now wake up from this life

We're going nowhere fast
Can you wake up from this world of ours?
It's so cold tonight
We're going nowhere fast
Can you wake up, wake up?
Let's burn this whole place to the ground

We're going nowhere fast
Can you wake up from this world of ours?
It's so cold tonight
We're going nowhere fast
Can you wake up, wake up?
Let's burn this whole place to the ground
