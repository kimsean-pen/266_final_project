Wind blowing through your hair
You look for love but it's not there
So go around acting spaced out all the time
You say that living has blown you mind
You say you know everything that's going on
but then you find that all you've seen is gone

Desperation grabs you by the throat
You know you're sinking bu t still you try to float
High pitched screaming blocks out everything you hear
But still you pretend that there's nothing to fear
You come on strong. You need nobody's help
It's plain to see you just don't know your self

Your head is a desert and you're locked within
waiting for some magical symphony to begin
But all that comes is a crazy whirlpool of sound
If you don't look and see your laughter will drown
You fool yourself and say life fits like a glove
But you don't know what you're thinking of

Revelations come pouring in your eyes
At last you find that part of you that was filled with lies
Sunshine is exploding the consciousness of your mind
The thunderstorm of derivation is finally behind
Now you know about this thing called love
At last my friend you know what you're dreaming of

Wind blowing through your mind
You think about the trouble that you left behind
You worked out all the tension inside your head
Because you found reality instead
Now there's peace within your love
At last you found what you're dreaming of
