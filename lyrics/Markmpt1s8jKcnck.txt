Give me traces of your lifeblood flowing in a loving cup
And tell me I'm dream, dream, dream, dreaming
And I'll never wake up
A keepsake in a dresser drawer
From who-knows-where
A symbol of your exegesis
And a full-length mirror

I'll never, never, never, never, never, never refuse you
I'll never, never, never, never, never, never refuse you
My blackbird chain
My blackbird chain
My blackbird chain
My blackbird chain

An SOS from an outpost there on a common air
Now I could read you a brief account of a last frontier
We could come to understand what's wrong
As right as rain
At rock bottom of a hollowed ground
We stake your claim

I'll never, never, never, never, never, never refuse you
I'll never, never, never, never, never, never refuse you
My blackbird chain
My blackbird chain
My blackbird chain
My blackbird chain

I'll never, never, never, never, never, never refuse you
I'll never, never, never, never, never, never refuse you
My blackbird chain
My blackbird chain
My blackbird chain
My blackbird chain
