What was the point of making you trust?
You live in a lie, the pain in the dust

God always shouts, and you always kick
Through passionless hours, yeah you make me sick

Your secret is told, but the body rejected
Your smile's a question, but the end is expected

A truce is attained, excuses are given
Time to assess
Now the nails have been driven

Time to assess, now the nails have been driven (x2)
