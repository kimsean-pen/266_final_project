This is the clock upon the wall
This is the story of us all
This is the first sound of a newborn child
Before he starts to crawl

This is the war that's never won
This is a soldier and his gun
This is the mother waiting by the phone
Praying for her son

Pictures of you, pictures of me
Hung upon your wall for the world to see
Pictures of you, pictures of me
Remind us all of what we used to be

(Wooh)

There is a drug that cures it all
Blocked by the governmental wall
We are the scientists inside the lab
Just waiting for the call

This earthquake weather has got me shakin'
Inside I'm high up and dry

Pictures of you, pictures of me
Hung upon your wall for the world to see
Pictures of you, pictures of me
Remind us all of what we used to be

Confess to me every secret moment
Every stolen promise you believed
Confess to me all that lies between us
All that lies between you and me

We are the boxers in the ring
We are the bells that never sing
There is a title we can't win
No matter how hard we might swing

Pictures of you, pictures of me
Hung upon your wall for the world to see
Pictures of you, pictures of me
Remind us all of what we could have been

Pictures of you, pictures of me
Hung upon your wall for the world to see
Pictures of you, pictures of me
Remind us all of what we could have been

Could have been (Oh)
We could have been (Oh)

Pictures of you, pictures of me
Remind us all of what we could have been
Could have been
