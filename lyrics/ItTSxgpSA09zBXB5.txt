If tomorrow never comes
I would want just one thing
I would tell it to the stars and the sun
I would write it for the world to see

And it's you
The light changes when you're in the room
Oh it's you oh it's you

If tomorrow never comes
I would want just one wish
To kiss your quiet mouth
And trace the steps with my fingertips

And it's you
The light changes when you're in the room
Oh it's you oh it's you, oh it's you

Oh it's you
