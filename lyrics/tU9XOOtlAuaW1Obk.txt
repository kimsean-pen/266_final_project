What there is to be shrunken is first stretched
What there is to be weakened is first made strong

What there will be withdrawn is first bestowed
What there will be thrown over is first raised up

Open your senses in a sexual union, there's a face behind the curtain,
Be a help and not a burden
Try to wash off blood with blood
Think no evil

Do without doing
Know without knowing
Get without getting
Go without going

The hard and strong will never surrender
The hard and strong will never surrender
The hard and strong will never surrender
The hard and strong will never surrender

Put no head higher than your own, think no evil
Put no head higher than your own
The hard and strong will never surrender
The hard and strong will never surrender
The hard and strong will never surrender
The hard and strong will never surrender
