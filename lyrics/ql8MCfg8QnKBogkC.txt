Yeah you sure broke my heart last week
When you said you had slept with him.
I know you called, I got them all. La da da da da da

Girl you better love what you got, before you go and give it away
But don't say that I don't know you

Cause Oh, I know all about your type
You're the type of girl that texts all day and talks all night.
And Oh, I know, that you are feeling sad.
Don't feel bad, cause even after three text messages, four missed calls
You still slept with my best friend.

Yeah, you sure got a lot of nerve, to say that this was all my fault.
I know you called, I got them all. La da da da da da

Girl you better love what you got, before you go and give it away
But don't say that I don't know you

Cause Oh, I know all about your type
You're the type of girl that texts all day and talks all night.
And Oh, I know that you are feeling sad.
Don't feel bad, cause even after three text messages, four missed calls
You still slept with my best friend.

So I sing rain, rain go away, come again another day
When I say it's okay to give a little hell to pay.
And every single time you make your way into my sheets
The hours move to minutes, the days turn into weeks.

And I know you're so cool, but I must be a fool
For taking you in and letting you win control of my heart.
And every single time you make your way into my sheets
The hours move to minutes, the days turn into weeks.

So I sing rain, rain go away, come again another day
