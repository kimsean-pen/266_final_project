You're too cool for me (you're too cool for me)
You can't love like a [?] (you're too cool for me)
Tell me why, you're too cool for me (you're too cool for me)
You get boys like they're growing on trees
(You're too cool for me, for me, for me)

You're my fantasy, alone in my room
Dancin' with the lights on, alone in my room
And if you [?], you're in my bed
And I just need you here, and not in my head

Got me on your lasso (reel me in, reel me in)
Got me where you want me (reel me in, reel me in)
And I don't know how I fell for you (fell for you)
But I know you're too cool for me

You're too cool for me (you're too cool for me)
You can't love like a [?] (you're too cool for me)
Tell me why, you're too cool for me (you're too cool for me)
You get boys like they're growing on trees
(you're too cool for me, for me, for me)

I found you in the bathroom
All alone, all alone
I found you in the bedroom
All alone, all alone
I wish you were real
I wish you were
I know we were real
I know we were

Got me on your lasso (reel me in, reel me in)
Got me on where you want me (reel me in, reel me in)
And I don't know how I fell for you (fell for you)
But I know you're too cool for me

You're too cool for me (you're too cool for me)
You can't love like a [?] (you're too cool for me)
Tell me why, you're too cool for me (you're too cool for me)
You get boys like they're growing on trees
(You're too cool for me, for me, for me)

You're too cool for me (you're too cool for me)
You can't love like a [?] (you're too cool for me)
Tell me why, you're too cool for me
