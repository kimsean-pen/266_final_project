Close the blinds, turn down the sun
Better run and hide, here they all come
With the hate in their eyes,
And lies on their tongues
So we stand and fight, an army of one
Everybody wants to rule the world it seems
If they fire first
You know what this means

This is war
They don't really care about us
Done playing by the rules
Got nothing left to lose
This is war

All is fair, we don't care
All is fair, we don't care

Skies so gray, we fight through the rain
We been hurt so long,
We can't feel the pain
Breaking down the walls,
With our bare hands
Every stone you threw at us
Becomes ammunition for us
No more turning back show them what we're
Made of yeah
So we fire first,
Ask questions later

This is war
They don't really care about us
Done playing by the rules
Got nothing left to lose
This is war

All is fair, we don't care
All is fair, we don't care
We don't care
Too much at stake
To be afraid we don't care
Put on your armor, let us pray
We'll live to fight another day

This is war
They don't really care about us
(they don't care)
Done playing by the rules
Got nothing left to lose
This is war (this is war)

All is fair, we don't care
All is fair, we don't care
All is fair, we don't care
All is fair, we don't care
