I've spent my last nights
strung up and pulled tight.
Holding out, sleep and grow.
An answer comes without a please:
'Do what you want.'

[Chorus:]
Wonder why I'm so caught of guard when we kiss.
Rather live my life in regret then do this.
What happened to the love we both knew?
We both chased.
Hanging on a cigarette you need me,
you burn me you'll burn me.

Hushed with a finger
Don't say you'll never when you might,
or just another time.
This poison comes instruction free.
Do what you want, but I'm drinking.

Wonder why I'm so caught off guard when we kiss.
Rather live my life in regret then do this.
What happened to the love we both knew?
We both chased.
Hanging on a cigarette you need me,
you burn me you'll burn me.

Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh
Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh
Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh
Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh
Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh
Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh
Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh
Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh [continues through chorus]

Wonder why I'm so caught of guard when we kiss
I'd rather live my life in regret than do this
What happened to the love we both knew, we both chased
Hanging on a cigarette you need me you burn me you'll burn me
What happened to the love we both knew, we both chased
Hanging on a cigarette you need me you burn me you'll burn me.
