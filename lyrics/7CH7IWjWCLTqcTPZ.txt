It's something deep through the soul
It's something warm throughout the dark
She: the key to fear not death
There's a passage over the gateway
That always waits for me to be complete
She: the silence, sheâ€¦
I fear doom no more
She takes me out of the quiet state of normality
Between two worlds I escape
Like a Lewis Carrol's tale
Alice falls in an inconstant universe so distant, so near
Follow, don't fear
Be praised of feared
Can't you hear her frantic call?
It's something you cannot ignore
Time has now come to create
New worlds appear to your inner sight
An entire life in few moments
Visions of new trajectories
New way, new space and colors unknown
New way, new space and colours unknown
Like a Lewis Carrol's tale
Alice falls in an inconstant universe so distant, so near
Her frantic call, in solitude I follow
Can't you hear her frantic call?
It's something you cannot ignore
Time has now come to create
New worlds appear to your inner sight
Her frantic call
In solitude I follow the light
Can't you hear her frantic call?
It's something you cannot ignore
Time has now come to create
New worlds appear to your inner sight
