Hello innocence
Though it seems like we've been friends for years
I'm finishing, how I wish I had never begun
Though it should be the last one

And it's dragging me down to my knees
Where I'm begging you please let me go
Don't you know?

I'm all over it now and I can't say how glad I am about that
I'm all over it now 'cause I worked and I cursed and I cried
And I said I could change and I lied
Well, there's something still moves me inside, yeah

She's a melody that I've tried to forget but I can't
It still follows me when I wake in the dead of the night
And I know that I can't find
That song going round in my head like the last things you said

Please don't go, you think I know

I'm all over it now and I can't say how glad I am about that
I'm all over it now 'cause I worked and I cursed and I cried
And I said I could change but I lied
Well, there's something still moves me inside

No, I won't come back, no, I won't come back
No, I won't come back, no, I won't come back

One dark morning she left without a warning
And took the red eye back to London town
I'm all over it now, I'm all over it now
I'm all over it now, I'm all over it now
I'm all over it now and I can't say how glad I am about that
I'm all over it now 'cause I worked and I cursed and I cried
And I said I would change but I lied
There's something still moves me inside, yeah
