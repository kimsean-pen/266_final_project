I'm feeling crazy, and I
I'm kinda faded, but I
I'm just too blunted, mane, we all too blunted
I'm finna stunt the drop, top to push the lot
Back down
Pop that pussy

I'mma hit it, when I hit it
I'm feeling super high, I'm finna touch the sky
Higher, won't you climb higher
The shape that you desire is in my eyes

You got me faded and I'm feeling like we made it
Like you just sky high and this my number one high
I can put you up, oh, nah, I'mma take you with
Ahh, I hate it when
I like it

You got me faded and I'm feeling like we made it
Like you just sky high and this my number one high
I can put you up, oh, nah, I'mma take you with
