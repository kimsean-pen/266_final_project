You'll burn this time
Seeing the violence
It's speeding my mind

No one is saving you
How can you find
A heaven in this hell?

Leave it behind
Hearing your silence it screams our goodbye
Cannot believe it's an eye for an eye
Let us go to waste

Angels have faith
I don't want to be a part of his sin
I don't want to get lost in his world
I'm not playing this game

When the shadows remain in the light of day
On the wings of darkness he'll retaliate
He'll be falling from grace
Until the end of all his days

From the ashes of hate
It's a cruel demon's fate
On the wings of darkness he's returned to stay
There will be no escape
Cause he's fallen far from grace

What have you done?
Is this what you wanted?
What have you become?

Your soul's now forsaken
You're walking alone
From heaven into hell

Now that you know
Your way in this madness
Your powers have grown

Your chains have been broken
You suffered so long
You will never change.

Angels have faith
I don't want to be a part of his sin
I don't want to get lost in his world
I'm not playing this game

When the shadows remain in the light of day
On the wings of darkness he'll retaliate
He'll be falling from grace

Till the end of all his days
From the ashes of hate
It's a cruel demon's fate

On the wings of darkness he's returned to stay
There will be no escape
Cause he's fallen far from grace

Angels have faith
I don't want to be a part of his sin
I don't want to get lost in his world
I'm not playing this game

When the shadows remain in the light of day
On the wings of darkness he'll retaliate
He'll be falling from grace

Until the end of all his days
From the ashes of hate
It's a cruel demon's fate

On the wings of darkness he's returned to stay
There will be no escape
Cause he's fallen far from grace.
