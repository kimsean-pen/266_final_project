I need you
Here with me
Don't take this
Too far now

Your eyes seem
So lonely
Inside you
Feel like you lost your mind

Coulda been the champagne
The champagne
Coulda been the cocaine
The cocaine
Coulda been the way you looked at me
That told me we were through
Through

And I miss you
All day now
I'm screaming
Inside out

Don't tempt me
Cause I'll break you
I don't need this
And I'll burn this whole thing down

Coulda been the champagne
The champagne
Coulda been the cocaine
The cocaine
Coulda been the way you looked at me
That told me we were through

It coulda been a bad day
A bad day
Coulda been the real way
The real way
Coulda been the way you looked at me
That told me we were through

I wish you
Would take from me
Everything
I cannot be

With eyes so blind
You cannot see
That I won't ever leave

Coulda been the champagne
The champagne
Coulda been the cocaine
The cocaine
Coulda been the way you looked at me
That told me we were through

It coulda been a bad day
A bad day
Coulda been the real way
The real way
Coulda been the way you looked at me
That told me we were through

Coulda been the champagne
The champagne
Coulda been the cocaine
The cocaine

Coulda been the champagne
The champagne
Coulda been the cocaine
The cocaine
Coulda been the way you looked at me
That told me we were through
Through
We were through
Now we're through
