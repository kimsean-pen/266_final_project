Here comes the rebel inside
It's coming alive, it's coming alive
Can't stop, we're ready to fly
It's do or die, we're born to ride
Cause I'm gonna dance like I've got no regrets
Gonna make a night I won't forget
I'm hanging on a razor's edge
The edge, the edge

Gimme, gimme one more night
We goin' til we drop
We make it stupid hot
Show 'em, show 'em what we got
Gimme one more night
We goin' super hot
We're shooting like the stars
Just gimme, gimme one more night

One more night
One more night
One more night

James dean, that's how we'd be
Living fast, built for speed
Caught lose, wild and free
Forever young, we're dtp
Cause I'm gonna dance like I've got no regrets
Gonna make a night I won't forget
I'm hanging on a razor's edge
The edge, the edge

Gimme, gimme one more night
We goin' til we drop
We make it stupid hot
Show 'em, show 'em what we got
Gimme one more night
We goin' super hot
We're shooting like the stars
Just gimme, gimme one more night

One more night
One more night
One more night

Cause I'm gonna dance like I've got no regrets
Gonna make a night I won't forget
I'm hanging on a razor's edge
The edge, the edge

One more night
One more night
One more night
One more night

Gimme, gimme one more night
We goin' til we drop
We make it stupid hot
Show 'em, show 'em what we got
Gimme one more night
We goin' super hot
We're shooting like the stars

Gimme, gimme one more night
We goin' til we drop
We make it stupid hot
Show 'em, show 'em what we got
Gimme one more night
We goin' super hot
We're shooting like the stars
Just gimme, gimme one more night

One more night
One more night
One more night
One more night
