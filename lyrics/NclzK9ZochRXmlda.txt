All my worst nights are the best times
West Coast stealing all my shut-eye
All my worst nights are the good kind
High life filtered through the lo-fi

Starting it up after dark
Chasing thoughts, cruising through Echo Park
Joined the vultures eating paradise
Getting tilted, yeah, we'll pay the price

But ain't it nice?
Never say, "Goodbye," we say, "Hello"
Faded in the sunshine and the snow

All my worst nights are the best times
West Coast stealing all my shut-eye
All my worst nights are the good kind
High life filtered through the lo-fi

Ahh
Ahh
Ahh
Ahh

Skipping lines and brushing past the suits
Ducking pictures and dropping some truths
Now I'm getting lost up in the Hills
But cruise the 'Gram and now I'm catching feels

Is this for real?
Never say Goodbye, we say Hello
Faded in the sunshine and the snow

All my worst nights are the best times
West Coast stealing all my shut-eye
All my worst nights are the good kind
High life filtered through the lo-fi

Ahh (yeah)
Ahh
Ahh (uh huh)
Ahh

Yeah, you know
It's only in L.A
Yeah, uh huh
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
Ahh
Only in L.A
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)

All my worst nights are the best times
West Coast stealing all my shut-eye
All my worst nights are the good kind
High life filtered through the lo-fi

(Lo-fi, lo-fi)
Yeah, uh huh
Highs filtered through the low
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
You know, woo
High life filtered through the lo-fi
