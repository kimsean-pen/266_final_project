When the time came they put me in my place
Red x'd, discarded and replaced
It'd be human to let it go someday
But I've got it stored above my rib cage

Now that this newborn terminal moves
Now that there's all this logic removed

It feels
It feels like a lie
It feels
It feels like a lie

My voice floats across on a wave
While my mouth is motionless and restrained

Now that this newborn terminal moves
Now that there's all this logic removed

It feels
It feels like a lie
It feels like a lie
It feels
It feels like a lie
It feels
It feels like a lie
It feels like a lie
It feels
It feels like a lie

It feels
It feels like a lie
It feels like a lie
It feels
It feels like a lie
It feels
It feels like a lie
