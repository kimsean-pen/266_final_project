If they only knew
How to keep you safe like I kept you
How to speak the words they've never used
I wish they only knew
If they only saw
The way my lips would shake when they met yours
The way your heart was met with open doors
I wish they only saw

They've never ever had the strength
To feel the weight in what we meant
So leave, go home
Yeah, leave, go home

If you only knew
Our love is just another shade of blue
He feels the same way that I do
I wish you only knew
If you only saw
His eyes light up like I adore
His smile on me then nothing more
I wish you only saw

They've never ever had the strength
To feel the weight in what we meant
So leave, go home
Yeah, leave, go home

If they only knew
If they only knew
If they only knew
I wish they only knew
If they only saw
If they only saw
If they only saw
I wish they only saw

If they only knew
If they only knew
If they only knew
I'd still be holding you
