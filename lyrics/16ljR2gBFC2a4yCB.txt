I don't get the guy I'm
I don't get guy I'm lovin'
I'm lovin
I don't get the guy I'm
I don't get guy I'm lovin'

She will break the most of we
Just look at what you're humpin'
I'm hoping
She will break the most of we
Just look at what you're humpin'
I'm hoping

Baby, Love, you don't know
What that means
Baby, Love
Disappearing while you're here
Baby, Love, you don't know
What that means
Baby, Love
Disappearing while you're here, baby
You just knock me off my feet
I'm sweating off my body
I shiver
When I'm walking on the street
I'm tryin' not to worry
Have mercy

Baby, Love, you don't know
What that means
Baby, Love
Disappearing while you're here
Baby, Love, you don't know
What that means
Baby, Love
Disappearing while you're here, baby
Lovin' somebody
We can have fun
Sure you don't want it
The night is young
Thinking I'm falling
Better I'll run
Mama don't let me
Don't let me reaching the ground
Lovin' somebody
We can have fun
Sure you don't want it
The night is young
Thinking I'm falling
Better I'll run
Mama don't let me
Don't let me reaching the ground
...
Baby, Love, you don't know
What that means
Baby, Love
Disappearing while you're here
Baby, Love, you don't know
What that means
Baby, Love
Disappearing while you're here, baby
