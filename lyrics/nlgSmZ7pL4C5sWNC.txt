A million lights
Hanging on the world tonight
I see I'm reaching down
Dancing on the evening time

For you
All the stars are singing
With you
Everyday I'm feeling alive

A million days
In everyone I've seen your face
I know I'd never be alone
Even if darkness comes our way

For you
All the stars are singing
With you
Everyday I'm feeling alive

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh

For you
All the stars are singing
In you
I can feel you're reaching
For you
All the stars are singing (all the stars are singing)
With you
Everyday I'm feeling alive

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh

All the stars are singing (oh oh oh)
All the stars are singing (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Everyday I'm feeling (ooh ooh ooh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh)
All the stars are singing (all the stars)
All the stars are singing (all the stars)
All the stars (ooh ooh ooh)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh)
