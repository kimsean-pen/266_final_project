Hard days I'm travelling
Alone for too long
Ooh, I'm missing you
I'm always somewhere
That I never belong
Ooh, I'm missing you
I'm moving so fast now
It doesn't seem true
Ooh, I'm missing you
I'm getting closer
But I don't know what to
Ooh, I'm missing you.

Oho, If I had you beside me
Then I just might sleep through the night
Your love is the promise that guides me
All of the days of my life.

This life I'm living's
Getting so hard to feel
Ooh, I'm missing you
The days are empty
And the nights are unreal
Ooh, I'm missing you

Oho, If I had you beside me
Then I just might sleep through the night
Your love is the promise that guides me
All of the days of my life
All of the days of my life.

Hard days I'm travelling
Alone for too long
Ooh, I'm missing you
I'm always somewhere
That I never belong
Ooh, I'm missing you.

Oho, If I had you beside me
Then I just might sleep through the night
Your love is the promise that guides me
All of the days of my life
All of the days of my life.
