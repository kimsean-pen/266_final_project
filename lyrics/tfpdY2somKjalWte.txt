I was
Waiting for you
I was
Standing around
I was
Getting older
I was
Going down

If you always get up late
You'll never be on time
If you always make it after work
ba ba dada
after work

Oh the day never comes
and I stand up
Waiting on

I saw you down there
I know you were tired
I saw you
You looked like a swimmer

I wanna be with you
All of the time
Why can't you satisfy

You look good
but you sound better
you were the best I had

If you always get up late
You're never gonna be on time
If you always get up late
You're never gonna be on time
And that's a shame

Cause I like you
I never see you
