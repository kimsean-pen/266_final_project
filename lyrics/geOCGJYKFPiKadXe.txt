We talk, talk 'til we're blue in the face
The words, the words don't resonate
Seasons, they always seem to stay the same
I'm holding on to things we said we would change

I'm stuck, babe
Stuck with nowhere to go
It cuts, babe, 'cause we're just taking it slow
It's overdue, make your move
Stuck, babe
Stuck with nowhere to go

You move, and I don't really know what to say
Too soon, am I supposed to feel this way?
Reach out but I don't wanna get in your way
Too little, too late, I know that's what you're gonna say

I'm stuck, babe
Stuck with nowhere to go
It cuts, babe, 'cause we're just taking it slow
It's overdue, make your move
Stuck, babe
Stuck with nowhere to go

I see it in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
We ain't satisfied
Waste away our lives, our lives, our lives
We ain't satisfied

We talk, talk 'til blue in the face
Holding on to the things we said we would change

You know I'm stuck, baby
Stuck with nowhere to go
(You know I'm stuck here)
It cuts, babe, 'cause we're just taking it slow
(Taking it slow)

Stuck, baby
Stuck with nowhere to go
Stuck, baby
Stuck with nowhere to go

I see it in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
We ain't satisfied
Stuck, baby
Stuck with nowhere to go
