The Process revealed, which road is chosen?
Meaning is broken, the question never comes
The heartless believe, passion is misused
All the feelings abused, the answer never comes

Second front freeze out, palate expanding
Crisis demanding, the message never comes
Stateless invention, always intended
Thought is pretended, the feeling never comes
Statues erected, to no one elected
Children point fingers and objects fall down
Reason dissected, it's what is expected
Question mark lingers and objects fall down
The process reveals all the false meaning
Where it is leaning, the party never comes
Death in the morning, afternoon sunshine
Everyone's too blind, the vision never comes
Statues erected to no one elected
Children point fingers and objects fall down
Reason dissected, it's what is expected
Question mark lingers and objects fall down
