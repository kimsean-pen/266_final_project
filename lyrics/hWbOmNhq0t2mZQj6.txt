I'm not comfortable with how we never talk
And I miss you since you went out for that walk
Its been 13 months since May
It still feels like yesterday

I was scared to fix what I had broke
Its a lonely place to live with just a ghost
There is love left in my life, I will see
But you still hurt me

I can still see all your clothes thrown on the floor
There are friends who never call me anymore
I remember throwing out all of your things
But I think I kept your ring

I'm not comfortable with how the story ends
We were lovers and now we're not even friends
You were perfect and I guess I'm just a creep
But you still hurt me
