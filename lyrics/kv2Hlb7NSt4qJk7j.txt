It's hard to come to terms
That things can't be taught but learned
Like feeling when you question reason
The ceiling came down this season

Keep this a secret
I hope we never make it past our town
Forever living with a frown

I feel like I should be concerned
That things can't be saved once once they're burned
But for once I threw it in the furnace
I watched it burn right between us

Keep this a secret
I hope we never make it past our town
Forever living with a frown

And all along
All I ever wanted was someone to tell me I'm wrong
I'm wrong
I'm wrong
You're wrong
I'm gone
