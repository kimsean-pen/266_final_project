America, hot as hell
Hysterical, cast a spell

The endless road, another night to bend your mind
White line fever, I think that state patrol car's still behind

America, cold as death
Up to Canada, crystal meth

Another West Coast turnaround and back to start
Yakima Reservation, just another broken heart

America, we liked it fine
Sinsemilla, Ripple Wine

Another schoolgirl with her daddy's Pontiac
Another killer from the wrong side of the tracks

America, fast cars
America, the girls, the bars
America, don't make no fuss
America, get on the bus
