I'm Sorry but I need to move slow
And I need you to wait
You're trying to fill this space
But baby this room is all, Mine
You think you want me
But you just want more

So think before you kiss me, Baby
I'll never be enough
So I'll try to keep my hands to myself
But it's hard for me when you're always around
So I'll try to find a distraction for myself
But you've got my attention baby when you're around.

Baby if you call me up
And I'm just sitting at home
Come over if you want
And we can take things nice and slow

Baby, I want you, even just for a night
I want to feel you, inside
Baby I want you, it's alright
You can open me up, open me up, open me baby

So next time you call
Remember that I'm no good for you
So next time you text please don't
Don't forget that I'm no good for you

Baby if you call me up
And I'm just sitting at home
Come over if you want
And we can take things nice and slow
