Cotton blossom, you'll be forgotten
You're picked and clipped and then you rot away
Something tells me this is not your day
August harvest
Hole in the garden
You're smiling, smiling never wants to say
Nothing, nothing gets me on my way

Here, gone, all day long
Burning in the sunshine
Running with an old time friend

Here, gone, all day long
Burning in the sunshine
Running with an old time friend

Here, gone, all day long
Burning in the sunshine
Running with an old time friend
