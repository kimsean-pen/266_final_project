I've come from far from chains, From metal and stone
From makeshift designs, And seeking a star

To grab for the truth, To keep myself warm
I turn and it's gone gone, You smile and it's born

The rhymes of our women's, A river that never ends
The Rhymes of Dimension, Surrounds us with fire and friends
And roaring through darkness
The Night children fly
I still hear them singing the rhymes of goodbye...

There's nothing within, but within says a voice
That's still my Empire, And I've got a choice

It's healers of death, It still got a fire
And I keep it burning, with hands of desire

The bells of our senses can cost us our pride
Can toll out the boundaries that level our lives

Can slash like the sunlight through shadows and cracks
Our nakedness calling, Our nakedness back

The rhyme of our passions, Find beaty in loving love
The rhyme of our madness, Burn cities and push'n'shoves
And roaring through darkness
The Night children fly
I still hear them singing the rhymes of goodbye...
