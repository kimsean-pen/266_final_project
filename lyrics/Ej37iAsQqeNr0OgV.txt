I'm frightened at night, and the wind has a roar
It seeps through the hall, and from under the door
Like the shit that was said, I can't take it that well
I give and I give and I give and I give and I'm still
Lost and hurt and bone thin from the love that's been starved
I know I've got close but I'm sure it's too far
From the point of suspense, we know it should be
The end of the part, of our favorite movie
Where the guy grabs the girl and gives her his hand
Says take me away from this torturous land
Cause the grave is set up, the hole that I dug
I gave and I gave and I gave and I gave you my trust
Like the time that we kissed, and you gave me a lie
To add to this scene you pretended to cry
But I'm here and I'm cool, the way that it is
Just give me a chance and I'll try to forgive

And I don't know
And I can't guess
If we're gonna be okay, but now
My last wish
Is that you do this with me, kiss me here
and hold my hand
Let me feel like I'm the only one
I know you can

Won't you do it for me now

I really had it with the rain of the tears
The predictable storm that has come every year
And it sneaks in from shore with a bat in it's hand
I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying I can't
You're a thief and a witch, but I love you to death
You steal my heart and curse under your breath

But the one thing that I can most willing prove
That when you are gone I'll be fine without you

And I don't know
And I can't guess
If we're gonna be okay, but now
My last wish
Is that you do this with me, kiss me here
and hold my hand

Let me feel like I'm the only one
I know you can
Won't you do it for me now

Now just hold on, hold on to me
Hold on, hold on to me hold on to me
Hold on, hold on to me hold on to me
Hold on, hold on to me hold on to me
Hold on, hold on to me hold on to me
Hold on, hold on to me hold on to me
Hold on, hold on to me hold on to me
Hold on, hold on to me hold on to me
Hold on, hold on to me hold on to me
Hold on, hold on to me hold on to me.
