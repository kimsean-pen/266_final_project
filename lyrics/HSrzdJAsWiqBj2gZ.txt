Will we ever find our neverland?
Will we ever be at peace again?
Will we ever find our neverland?
Will we ever be at peace again?

I caught you sitting on the boardwalk, counting shudders
Your tears were falling on the note left by your brother
Love me now, take whatever's left.

We try to reconnect, but can't find one another
I saw you looking at the high, crossed, starry lovers
When I'm gone, what will you become?

Will we ever find our neverland?
Drinking on a Monday, sleeping just to numb the pain
Will we ever be at peace again?
Further is forever, restless till the day we die

Will we ever find our neverland?
Drinking on a Monday, sleeping just to numb the pain
Will we ever be at peace again?
Further is forever, restless till the day we die

Sleeping just to numb the pain
Restless till the day we die
Sleeping just to numb the pain
Will we ever find

Stand up child and turn toward the lightning and the thunder
So I can see what I've known for all these years

Your skin shudders with my fingers
You're cold, but I know it's not your fault.
The storm is coming now
Can we survive somehow?

Will we ever find our neverland?
Drinking on a Monday, sleeping just to numb the pain
Will we ever be at peace again?
Further is forever, restless till the day we die

Will we ever find our neverland?
Drinking on a Monday, sleeping just to numb the pain
Will we ever be at peace again?
Further is forever, restless till the day we die

Sleeping just to numb the pain
Restless till the day we die
Sleeping just to numb the pain
Will we ever find
