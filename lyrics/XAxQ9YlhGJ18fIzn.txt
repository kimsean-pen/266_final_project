I love you
I don't need a ring to
Prove that you're worthy
You're under my skin
It's easy
I don't need a lock to
Prove that you trust me
I walk the walk

To be with you
Just to be with you
Oh, to be with you
Just to be with you

Save your first and last dance for me
I don't need a white wedding
Save your first and last born for me
We don't need a white wedding
All the girls I loved before
Told me they signed up for more
Save your first and last chance for me
'Cause I don't want a white wedding

I told you
I struggled to say before
Ain't no worry
By letting you in
It's easy
How quickly the faults set in
When I'm happy
I stop the clock

To be with you
Just to be with you
Oh, to be with you
Just to be with you

Save your first and last dance for me
I don't need a white wedding
Save your first and last born for me
We don't need a white wedding
All the girls I loved before
Told me they signed up for more
Save your first and last chance for me
'Cause I don't want a white wedding

Keep your name
You can keep your dates
Keep your name
You can keep your fame
Keep your name
You can keep your dates
Keep your name
You can keep it all
Keep your name
You can keep your dates
Keep your name
You can keep your fame
Keep your name
You can keep your dates
Keep your name
You can keep it all

Save your first and last dance for me
I don't need a white wedding
Save your first and last born for me
We don't need a white wedding
All the girls I loved before
Told me they signed up for more
Save your first and last chance for me
'Cause I don't want a white wedding
