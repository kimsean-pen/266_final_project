Lady have you known me-
The perfect love machine,
I'm Virgo, My Leo's rising
Venus made me King
That trail of broken hearts
They all belong to me
Magic runs through my fingers-
One touch you'll see

L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine, oh
L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine, oh
L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine, oh
L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine tonight

tonight

What can I do for you,
Am I your wildest dream
What do I move in you
Am I what I seem
My eyes they lie and you cry
Love brings you pain
And if you try to love me
You'll not feel the same

L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine, oh
L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine, oh
L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine, oh
L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine tonight

tonight

L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine, oh
L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine, oh
L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine, oh
L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine tonight

tonight
