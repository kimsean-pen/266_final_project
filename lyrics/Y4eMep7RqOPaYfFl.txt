dThere's a glass, on the edge of the table
There's a mask, in the eye of my mind
Big shadows moving, down over the carpet
Clouds seem to pass, in through the blinds
I went riding, down to the shore
Seagulls gliding, over the sea

So say goodbye to me
If I never see you again
At least, we had the sun
Back east, where the boys all sit on the land
I do, impressions of you

Inside a box, that's made out of seashells
I keep a watch, slides off my hand
Old folded letter, with pictures of sailboats
Ones that you dream of, involved one pen
I go riding, down to the shore
Seagulls gliding, over the sea

Just say goodbye to me
If I never see you again
At least, we had the sun
Back east, where the boys all sit on the land ranch
I do, impressions of you

Thunder on the beach, blinding in the sky
Flying off my back, just stealing the breeze
Climbing in that seat, on the bus so high
in my eyes while brakes release, searching the street

Say goodbye to me
If I never see you again
At least, at least we had the sun
Way back east, where the boys all on the land
I do, impressions of you
