It's been a long day
At the bottom of the hill.
She died of a broken heart.
She told me I was living in the past
Drinking from a broken glass.
I'm alone
I never wanna be alone.
Now I.Now I turn to face the cold.
I'm alone
I never wanna be alone.
Now I.Now I turn to travel home.
I walked down to the other end today
Just to catch those last few rays.
I held out my hand
And slowly waved goodbye.
I turned now my eyes up to the sky.
I'm alone
I never wanna be alone.
Now I.Now I turn to face the cold.
I'm alone
I never wanna be alone.
Now I.Now I turn to travel home.
She'll come back to me.
She'll come back to me.
All alone in this misery.
She'll come back to me.
I held out my hands into the light
And I watched it die.
I know that I was part to play.
I've done my time
And I never want to spend my life alone.
I'm alone
I never wanna be alone.
Now I... Now I turn to face the cold.
I'm alone
I never wanna be alone.
Now I.Now I turn to travel home.
