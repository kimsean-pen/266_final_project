Won't you say what's on your mind?
Say what's on your mind verbatim
Tell me that you're mine
Show me what you're made of
Say what's on your mind
Say that shit verbatim
Cause I've been second guessing everything
Won't you say me, babe, verbatim
You know that I'ma be the one that's there for you

When you ain't got nobody, swear to God
Won't you say what's on your mind, verbatim?
You know that I'ma be the one that keeps it real with you
When everybody's fake as fuck
I'll say what's on my mind, verbatim

You've been on too long, girl

Them Xans make you look tired
I ain't tryna piss you off
You know that I ain't biased
You come in, you stumblin'
You smellin' like Jamison
That ain't cute, that ain't you
I know you, girl
And you've been on too long
That cocaine make you crazy
You lose your keys, you lose your phone
Almost every night it seems lately
And I want you and that's so true
But I'ma cut you off if that's what I gotta do
So say what's your mind

Say what, say what's on your mind
You know that I'ma be the one that's there for you

When you ain't got nobody, swear to God
Won't you say what's on your mind, verbatim?
You know that I'ma be the one that keeps it real with you

When everybody's fake as fuck
I'll say what's on my mind, verbatim
You know that I'ma be the one that's there for you

When you ain't got nobody, swear to God
Won't you say what's on your mind, verbatim?
You know that I'ma be the one that keeps it real with you
When everybody's fake as fuck
I'll say what's on my mind, verbatim
