I know you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything and everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy, your enemy

So you wanna play with magic
Boy you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm comin' atcha like a dark horse

Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's is no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away
Don't walk away

It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure
Before you give it all to me
All to me
Give it all to me

So you wanna play with magic
Boy you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm comin' atcha like a dark horse

Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

So you wanna play with magic
Boy you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm comin' atcha like a dark horse

Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine

There's no going back
There's no going back,
There's no going back
There's no going back
