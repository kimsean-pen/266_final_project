From the very beginning, I felt I couldn't live this way
To debase myself for the sake of your society
I blame your vain deceits for I see the plain hypocrisy
Of concealing my thoughts to gain security

I wasn't born into this world to endure your failures and faults
When life is bu t once given
I'd rather stand here on my own for I don't wish to trade my soul
I loathe this deficient civilization

When saints are just dead sinners amended and revised
No wonder why greed and humiliation
Become the norms to bound and regulate humankind
We welcome the reign of consternation

Hey, look at yourselves, crawling in filth and blatant lies
Still fooling yourselves, you run away until you die

I remain dazed and speechless in front of such inanity
Is it mere wishful thinking to ask for rationality?
To rate by proxy judgements, to never doubt authority
It doesn't sound like freewill but calculated slavery

Just as diamond and coal are made of similar matter
It is easy to confuse a swine in business suit from a man
Feels like I am the sole survivor of a vanished nation
Which knew that truth lays in this place no one dares to explore

When saints are just dead sinners amended and revised
No wonder why greed and humiliation
Become the norms to bound and regulate humankind
We welcome the reign of consternation

Lays in this place no one dares to explore
