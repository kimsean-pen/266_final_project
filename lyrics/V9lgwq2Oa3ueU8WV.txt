Ooooh

Oh, Alice, dear where have you been?
So near, so far, so in between
What have you heard, what have you seen?
Alice, Alice, please, Alice!

Oh, tell us, are you big or small
To try this one or try them all
It's such a long, long way to fall
Alice, Alice, oh, Alice!

How can you know this way not that?
You choose the door, you choose the path
Perhaps you should be coming back
Another day, another day
And nothing is quite what is seems
You're dreaming! Are you dreaming? Oh, Alice!

Ahhhhh, Alice
Ahhhhh

Oh, how will you find your way?
Oh, how will you find your way?

No time for tears today
No time for tears today
No time for tears today
No time for tears today

Ahhhhhh

So many doors, how did you choose?
So much to gain, so much to lose
So many things got in your way
No time today, no time today
Be careful not to lose your head
Just think of what the doormouse said, Alice!

Oooooh

Did someone pull you by the hand?
How many miles to Wonderland?
Please tell us so we'll understand
Alice, Alice, oh, Alice!

Oh, how will you find your way?
Oh, how will you find your way?
