Oooh Oooh Oooh

Lonesome light years
Tethered tears
Pull me near
And I will have no fear
And in the darkness
I fall in love
And in your arms
I'm safe from harm

Your current sets me free
I'm feeling your electricity
You are my galaxy
A star struck heart beat
I'm bound by your gravity
You are my galaxy
You are my galaxy

Powers up
And we are one
Can you feel the love
And the midnight sun
Feel no g force
Weightless our
Web is spun
Thy will be done
