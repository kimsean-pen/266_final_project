I want to be with you
But sometimes life becomes too real
I want to see the things
In my heart I know I feel

I'd rather stay in my head
Pretend that I'm lying in your arms
But I know I'll see you soon
Spread thin to cover, battle spread

Wouldn't you like to cure the pain sometime
Oh camera, now it's too late
Wouldn't you like to cure the pain sometime
Oh camera, now it's too late

I want to be with you
But sometimes life becomes too real
I want to see the things
In my heart I know I feel

When you turn me off at night
Pretend that I'm lying in your arms

Wouldn't you like to cure the pain sometime
Oh camera, now it's too late
Wouldn't you like to cure the pain sometime
Oh camera, now it's too late

Wouldn't you like to cure the pain sometime
Oh camera, now it's too late
Wouldn't you like to cure the pain sometime
Oh camera, now it's too late.
