Hey!
Everyone, anyone want to hear
Movin' a little closer
Let me tell you about
At love natural!
All that love actual
Love that you just can help feeling
When feeling with meanings

Keep on appearing
And it's almost midnight
The time is coming up, the time is getting closer
The time is almost here
Love is upon us
And the time for love is here right now...
When I look at you, oh, I feel my heart
Oh I feel in love deep inside

Oh love natural
I can't believe
How you do to me
You make me feel
Oh how you say

Feel so special
All love natural
I can't believe
How are you to me
You make me feel

Oh how you say
Feel so special
Let me tell you something, now
Something you may not believe, yeah
Oh let me talk about this feeling

Inside it's happening to me
Oh
Oh yeah
It's almost our time, the moment's coming up
The moment to get closer
The moment's almost here
Love is upon us
And the time for love is here right now...

When I look at you, oh, I feel my heart
Oh I feel in love deep inside
All love natural
I can't believe
How you do to me

You make me feel or how you say
Feel so special.
All love natural
I can't believe
How you do to me

You make me feel or how you say
Feel so special
Oh love natural
I can't believe
How are you to me

You make me feel or how you say
Feel so special
All the way, you're moving all
Gonna find out love today
Let love go on and on
And we're climbing on the way to the top of the highest mountain
Flying through the skies we'll never seen before
And we dives into the depths of the deepest ocean

Sailing on the seas we've never seen before
Seen before
Oh love natural
I can't believe
How you do to me
You make me feel
Oh how you say
Feel so special
Oh love natural
I can't believe
How are you to me
You make me feel or how you say
Feel so special
