Turned so nasty now
The dark cell
The pillar of my soul
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell

Little by little by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
Once you've been around you've been around enough

Little by little by hook or by crook
Never living earnest, never get judged
I'm no idiot, I should look

Your clue on hold, the flag and pole
I'm curling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal

Obligations
Complications
Routines and schedules
A job that's killing you
Killing you

Little by little by hook or by crook
Never living earnest, never get judged
I don't know where it is I should look

Little by little by hook or by crook
I am such a tease, and you're such a flirt
