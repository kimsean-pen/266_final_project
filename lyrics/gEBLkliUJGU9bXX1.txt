Now you're gone
I wonder why you left me here
I think about it on and on and on and on and on again
I know you're never coming back
I hope that you can hear me
I'm waiting to hear from you
Until I do

You're gone away
I'm left alone
A part of me is gone
And I'm not moving on
So wait for me
I know the day will come

I'll meet you there
No matter where life takes me to
I'll meet you there
And even if I need you here
I'll meet you there

I wish I could have told you
The things I kept inside
But now I guess it's just too late
So many things remind me of you
I hope that you can hear me
I miss you
This is goodbye
One last time

You're gone away
I'm left alone
A part of me is gone
And I'm not moving on
So wait for me
I know the day will come

I'll meet you there
No matter where life takes me to
I'll meet you there
and even if I need you here
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there

And where I go you'll be there with me
Forever you'll be right here with me

I'll meet you there
No matter where life takes me to
I'll meet you there
and even if I need you
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
