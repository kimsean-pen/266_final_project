And so now, now that you realized
That planets are spheres with oil on the inside
And your God is only a catapult
Waiting for the right time to let you go
Into the unknown, just to watch you hold your breath
Yeah and surrender your fortress

And your thoughts will tumble like rocks do
Over the valleys of factory oceans
The Turkish carpets are flappin' as the wind
Drops you down to the surface
Yeah, when you're looking for your sweethearts

And you're, you're the kind to hide your eyes from the sun
And in your world, the strong survive
But I won't take my body down

Let me tell you, your arms are like boulders
And your shoulders are cliffs
But your head keeps rolling off
And your spine, it is weak
From the weight on your shoulders
And from difference of opinion

There's a song you hear on the radio
It's a funeral march so you change the channel
But it's all you hear
As you're driving up the 101 from Mexico to California
Yeah, there's no snow, yeah when you're looking for your sweethearts
There's no snow when you're looking for your answers

Yeah, you're, you're the kind to hide your eyes from the sun
And in your world the strong survive
But I won't take my body down

Yeah, by the time they get your letter of explanation
You'll be dead and gone, barking up a new tree
And eyeing up some new friends
And scaring off the families, while tidying up your loose ends

Chasing squirrels around your property
Making sure that they know that this is your kingdom
And nothing will stop it, yeah, nothing will stop it
If nothing can stop it, yeah, nothing will stop it

And you're, you're the kind to hide your eyes from the sun
And in your world the strong survive
But would you lay your body down

Yes, and now, now's the time to wrap your ears around the sounds
Of your train coming 'round
But you will have to lay everything down
