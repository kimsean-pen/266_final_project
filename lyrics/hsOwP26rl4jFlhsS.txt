It was wrong
Would've never worked
Or at least I tell myself
To not make it hurt
I'll try to blast music
In attempt to get you out of my eyes
But I can't escape my mind

I hate you 'cause I always
Look at your picture
And I tell myself that I'm over it
But then I get a little unsure

I wish I could get you
Out of my mind
But I think about it all the time
And I wish I could not think
For once in my life
But when I see your face
I can't escape my mind

I know we were never a thing
But I always think about
What could've happened if we kept going
And I never had this happen to me
Only in the movies
But honey it is happening

I hate you 'cause I always
Look at your picture
And I tell myself that I'm over it
But then I get unsure

I wish I could get you
Out of my mind
But I think about it all the time
And I wish I could not think
For once in my life
But when I see your face
I can't escape my mind

I can't escape my mind
I wish I could turn it off sometimes
I can't escape my mind, oh
No matter how hard I try
I wish I could turn it off sometimes

I wish I could get you
Out of my mind
But I think about it all the time
And I wish I could not think
For once in my life
But when I see your face
I can't escape my mind
