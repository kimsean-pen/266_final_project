Save me...
'Cause I'm in a sea of beings
And there's no deny
The waves are holding me under

I'm drowning in a thousand faces
Alien expressions over and over again
I'm trying to scream, but I can't exhale
The world seems to spin as I'm left on this square
With no will to hold on
Am I the only one crushed by the weight of the world?

Save me...
'Cause I think I've swallowed more than I can comprehend
A soul laid low

A soul has lost its faith again
Wide awake in this hole
A maggot on a plate again
Wide awake in this hole
A soul has lost its faith
I've lost myself too long

Am I the only one crushed by the weight of the world?
