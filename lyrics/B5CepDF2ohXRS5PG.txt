I wish I met you, further along
Gave you my older heart, still and strong
But I wouldn't have a fire like I do today
Oh it burns for you babe

Oh, you got nothing on my tendency to be led astray
Oh, it took a blindside hit to show me the right of way

When your footsteps conquer the streets
From your eyes to the soles of your feet
May my body and heart remain wild
For I'm a wandering child

I could keep an arms length, so I don't fall
I never learned to punch with my back against the wall
Oh no, I gotta let it go

And I got a feeling, deep in my bones
I can't sit still when there's a space up in the road
There's a fire coming on you in your lane
Oh it burns for you babe

Oh, you got nothing on my tendency to be led astray
Oh, it took a blindside hit to show me the right of way

When your footsteps conquer the streets
From your eyes to the soles of your feet
May my body and heart remain wild
For I'm a wandering child

And I hope to god the time ain't wrong
And I hope to god the time ain't wrong
Cause I can't be hanging on like this for long
