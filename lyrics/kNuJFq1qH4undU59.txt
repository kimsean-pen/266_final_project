Once I was young
Once I was smart
Now I'm living on the edge of my nerves
The things we said weren't quite so tough
When we were young

Well I'm burning
I'm burning buildings
I'm building... this time

For the art of parties
Under heavy weather
The art of parties
I'm burning... burning

I'm living
I'm living my life
I'm living
This time

The wind blew through my hair
Once I was young
I'd shelter from the sun
Once I was smart
We lived on the strength of our nerves
When we were young

Well I'm burning
I'm burning buildings
I'm building... this time
