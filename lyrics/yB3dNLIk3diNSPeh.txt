We stab at our faith
To keep it alive.
We draw the blood
But the law draws the line.

A hand is a hand
A knife is a knife
Blood is blood
And life is life.

We could go anywhere
It would still be the same.
A change of climate, a change of air
All the pressure would remain.

I can read the unwritten law.
I can read the unwritten law.
A hand is a hand
A knife is a knife
Blood is blood
And life is life.
The unwritten law.
The unwritten law.
