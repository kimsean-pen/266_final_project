There's no world,
and no God,
and no hate,
and no fun,
and no faith,
and no God,
it's just me,
getting high.

Hey, somewhere outside
and I wish I could be there
most of the time.
As I give all the clues
and go out of the room,
as I gaze down the hall
it's just me,
not at all.

Hey, somewhere outside,
and I wish I could be there most of the time

And one of these days, I hope I come around
And one of these days, I hope I come around
And one of these days, I hope I come around
And one of these days, I hope I come around
And one of these days, I hope I come around
One of these days, I'll come around
One of these days, I'll come around
One of these days, I'll come around
And one of these days, I'll come around
And one of these days, I'll come around
And one of these days, I'll come around
One of these days, I'll come around
One of these days, I'll come around.
