That didn't work you shoulda known better
It's gonna suck when the camera stops rolling
And you find out soon
That the treatment wasn't worth it
They're all the same, they all want the money
They're all insane, they live for fame, honey
They laugh at you when you're not even bein' funny
Well I've been
Here before
And I've seen
First hand and front row seat
This little thing they call
A video girl (girl, girl)
Video girl who rocked my world
For a whole two seconds
And now I know
I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome
Get out of my face
Get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
'Cause I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome
You know it's bad when your momma doesn't like her
All your friends are saying she's a liar
Never ending phone calls aren't enough
(it's not enough, it's never enough)
Move to L.A
Got no talent
Not even like you won a Miss Teen Pageant
Daddy pays your bills but you still whine
I've been here before
And I've seen
First hand and front row seat
What happens to a man
(what happens to a man)
When he gets in the hands of a
Video girl who rocked my world
For a whole two seconds
And now I know
I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome
Get out of my face
Get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
'Cause I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome
You are never gonna see me missin'
(video girl syndrome)
I'm not gonna be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome
Yeah oh whoa oh
Video girl who rocked my world
For a whole two seconds
And now I know
I'm not about to be another victim
(I won't be a victim)
Get out of my face
Get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome
I won't be a victim
Of the video girl syndrome.
