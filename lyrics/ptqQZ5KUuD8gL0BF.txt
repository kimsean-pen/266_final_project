Need I say I love you
Need I say I care
Need I say that emotions are something we don't share
I don't want to be sitting here, trying to deceive you
Cause you know I know baby that I don't wanna go
We cannot live together
We cannot live apart
And that's the situation
I've known it from the start
Everytime that I look at you, I can see the future
Cause you know I know baby that I don't wanna go
Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Is there nothing I can say to make you change your mind
I watch the world go round and round
And see mine turning upside down.
Throwing it all away
Now who will light up the darkness
And who will hold your hand
Who will find you the answers when you don't understand
Why should I have to be the one who has to convince you
Cause you know I know baby that I don't wanna go
Someday you'll be sorry
Someday when you're free, memories will remind you that our love was meant to be
But late at night when you call my name, the only sound you'll hear, is the sound of your voice calling, calling out to me
Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
And there's nothing that I can say
We're throwing it all away
Just throwing it all away
Just throwing it all away
