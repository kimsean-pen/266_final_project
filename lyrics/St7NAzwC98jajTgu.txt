Well, I'd do anything
For my sweet sixteen
Yes, I'd do anything
For little run away child

Gave my heart an engagement ring,
She took everything,
Everything I gave her,
Oh sweet sixteen

Built a moon for a rocking chair,
I never guessed it would Rock her far from here
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Someone's built a candy castle
For my sweet sixteen
Someone took a candy brain
And filled it in

Well I'd do anything
For my sweet sixteen
I'd do anything
For little runaway child

Well memories will burn you
Memories grow older as people can
They just get colder
Like sweet sixteen

Oh, I see it's clear
Baby, that you are
All through here
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Someone's built a candy castle
For my sweet sixteen
Someone's built a candy house
To house her in

Someone's built a candy castle
For my sweet sixteen
Someone's built a candy brain
And filled it in

Well, I'd do anything
For my sweet sixteen
Yes, I'd do anything
For little run away child

Yeah sad and lonely and blue
Yeah getting over you
How, do you think it feels
Yeah to get up in the morning, get over you
Up in the morning, get over you
Wipe away the tears, get over you
Get over get over

My sweet sixteen
Oh runaway child
Oh sweet sixteen
My runaway girl

Gave my heart an engagement ring,
She took everything,
Everything I gave her,
Sweet sixteen

Built a moon for a rocking chair,
I never guessed it would Rock her far from here
Oh, oh, oh.

Someone's built a candy castle
For my sweet sixteen
Someone's built a candy house
To house her in

Someone's built a candy castle
For my sweet sixteen
Someone took a candy house
To house her in

And I'd do anything
For my sweet sixteen
I'd do anything
For that runaway child

Oh, sweet sixteen
Oh, sweet sixteen
I'd do anything
