She walks around you like she's better than everybody
You walk around looking so out of place
And that memory stays, that memory haunts me
You really think that you are fooling everybody
Should I give in, should I give up on a chase
It's not there, au contraire
But do what makes you happy

Do you need someone
Do you need someone to talk to
Do you need someone
Someone you can run to
Are you all alone
Do you need someone to talk to
Do you need someone
Someone you can run to
Are you all alone

She's got you locked down, baby it ain't even funny
You walked around like you've seen better days
With that look on your face
And that's what really kills me
I bite my tongue, my feelings' under lock and key
She bats her eyes as people fallin' at her knees
I don't care, au contraire
Just do what makes you happy

Do you need someone
Do you need someone to talk to
Do you need someone
Someone you can run to
Are you all alone
Do you need someone to talk to
Do you need someone
Someone you can run to
Are you all alone

Let me be the one, let me be the one [x3]
(The one you count on)
Let me be the one, let me be the one [x3]
(The one you count on)
Let me be the one, let me be the one [x2]
