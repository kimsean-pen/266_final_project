You, you

Him and her life is turned
The day I knew you would leave
I can barely breath
Can you hear me scream?

You thrown in all directions
You, epitome of perfection
She's lost her will
(She's lost her will)
Time is standing still

He walks her home
Now he walks alone
The days they turn into years
The eyes they drown in tears
Can you hear me scream?

You thrown in all directions
You, epitome of perfection
She's lost her will
She's lost her will
Time is standing still

The way we are
The way we were
It's just a shadow of what's wrong
The time with you
The time is stirred
I love you for so long

The hearts they turn
They turn away
She says to go, please don't you cry
Love lost was found
Night turns to day

You, thrown in all directions
You, epitome of perfection
She's lost her will
Time is standing still
You, thrown in all directions
You, epitome of perfection
She's lost her will
She's lost her will
Time is standing still
You, you, you
Time is standing still
