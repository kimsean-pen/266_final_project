Give me that diamond ring
Give me that love on the movie screen
And I won't feel a thing
Promise I won't feel a thing
Give me that kiss goodnight
Give me a call, tell me it's alright
And I won't feel a thing
Promise I won't feel a thing

And I guess that I got rewired
'Cause you're cold as ice but it feels like fire, fire, fire, fire
And the drugs don't work and I don't know why
But when you hurt me I go higher, higher, higher, higher

But when I'm crying on the bathroom floor
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could never ask for more
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover
Crying on the bathroom floor
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could never ask for more
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover

Give me your disrespect
Give me your pain and loneliness
And I'll love you the best
Promise I'll love you the best
Give me no peace of mind
Give me distress, give me all your lies
And I'll love you for life
Promise I'll love you 'til I die

But I'm crying on the bathroom floor
(Give me some more)
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could ever ask for more
(Would you give me some more)
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover
Crying on the bathroom floor
(Give me some more)
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could never ask for more
(Would you give me some more)
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover

It's asking a lot of myself
I'm asking a lot of myself
It's taking a lot out of me, loving you
It's taking a lot out of me, loving you
Asking a lot of myself
I'm asking a lot of myself
It's taking a lot out of me, loving you
There isn't a lot that I think I can do

I'm crying on the bathroom floor
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could ever ask for more
(Would you give me some more)
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover
Crying on the bathroom floor
(Give me some more)
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could never ask for more
(Would you give me some more)
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover
