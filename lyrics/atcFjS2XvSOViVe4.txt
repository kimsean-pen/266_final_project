Suicide, suicide
Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Suicide
Ha, ha-ha
Suicide, suicide
Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Suicide
Ha, ha-ha

Friends may become foes
High people follow
New shit can seem so old
Real hot to cold
Weakness (my weakness) plays a huge part (plays the biggest part)
My weak will made a stronger heart
He turns me upside down
I can't breathe (suicide) near in or out

Suicide
Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Suicide
Ha-ha-ha

Ridiculously sexy
This is ridiculous
This wait is driving me crazy
It's just ridiculous
(Oh, but it's)
Ridiculously sexy
This is ridiculous
This wait is driving me crazy
It's just ridiculous
(Oh, but it's)

(Wait!)
All my dreams come true
All my dreams come true
All my dreams
All my dreams come true
All my dreams, all my dreams
All my dreams come true
All my dreams, all my dreams

Come on and
This wait is driving me crazy
Can't you see what you do to me?
Oh, put me out of my misery
You're killing me
Look what you made me do
All my dreams come true
All my dreams come true
All my dreams come true
All my dreams come true
