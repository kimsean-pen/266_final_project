They've come to bring us gift
They've come to make us whole
They've come to give us God
Their gift of Heaven
They've come to make us civil
Their gifts as ransom
Their God comes with a cost
We must give up all

For prayers in a foreign tongue
To a foreign throne

Erase our traditions
Erase our way of being
Erase our elder's teachings
Erase, replace these ways
Generations of wisdom
In exchange for ransom
Your God comes with a cost
A cost to us all

Prayers in a foreign tongue to
A God unknown
From demons, you will never see
Prayers that will save your soul
Blessed are the children
We have come to save them all

We came to cure disease that
Has never made you ill
We came to make you clean
To protect you from yourself

They've come to bring us hope
They've come to save our souls
They've come to make us holy
They've come to give us Heaven
They've come to make us civil
Just like them
Their God comes with a cost
And we must give up
All of our traditions
Erase our way of being
Erase our elder's teachings
Erase, replace these ways
Generations of wisdom
They have taken away
Our culture has been erased

Bring every child they blessed
With the needle's mark
Chop off every little arm
Let the children bleed
