I won't wake
A wealthy man someday
Cause the sun, don't follow me

I won't wake,
Without a song to sing
Nothing to some
Everything to me

On my worst
I'll do my best
To make it seem
Like I am happy

I've grown numb
Dry as my tear ducts
I've grown dumb
and empty

But don't give up on me
give up on me
give up on me...
