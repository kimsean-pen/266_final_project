It's over
you don't need to tell me
I hope you're with someone
who makes you feel save in your sleeping tonight
I won't kill myself trying to stay in your life
I've got no distance left to run

When you see me
please
turn your back and walk away
I don't wanna see you
'cause I know the dreams that you keep
that's where we meet
when you're coming down

think of me here

I've got no distance left to run
whoo whoo whoo
It's over
I knew it would end this way
I hope you're with someone
who makes you feel
that this life, is a life

Who settles down
stays around
spends more time with you
I've got no distance left to run
I'm coming home
It's over
come on home
no more
