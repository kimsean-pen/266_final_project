I've seen this place a thousand times
I've felt this all before
And every time you call
I've waited there

As though you might not call at all

I know this face I'm wearing now
I've seen this in my eyes

And though it feels so great
I'm still afraid
That you'll be leaving anytime

We've done this once and then you closed the door
Don't let me fall again for nothing more

Don't say you love me
Unless forever
Don't tell me you need me
If you're not gonna stay

Don't give me this feeling
I'll only believe it
Make it real
Or take it all away

I've caught myself smiling alone
Just thinking of your voice
And dreaming of your touch
Is all too much
You know, I don't have any choice

Don't say you love me
Unless forever
Don't tell me you need me
If you're not gonna stay
Don't give me this feeling
I'll only believe it
Make it real
Or take it all away...
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We've done this once and then you closed the door
Don't let me fall again for nothing more
Don't say you love me
Unless forever
Don't tell me you need me
If you're not gonna stay
Don't give me this feeling
I'll only believe it
Make it real
Or take it all away
(Say you love me...)
Don't tell me you need me
If you're not gonna stay
Don't give me this feeling
I'll only believe it
Make it real (make it real)
Or take it all away
Take it all away
Or take it all away...
