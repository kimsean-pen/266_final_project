Just gimme the gees an we be clubbin yo
(Clubbin' yo)
Yeah a make we please and we be thuggin' now
(Thuggin' now)

Sippin' Hennessey an we'll be bubblin yo
(Bubblin' yo)
Set we mind at ease we gotta take it slow

So when yuh see di S.P. floatin', don't provoke him
Cau di girls we be pokin', ganja smokin'
Best ting fi di recreation
A fi get the best girls inna every nation

Topper girls we be promotin' and supportin'
And dem love how we flow king here them shouting
First class ticket invitation girls from
New York, England and Jamaica

Everyday, we be burnin' not concernin' what nobody wanna say
We be earnin' dollars turnin'g cau we mind deh pon we pay
Haulin' gold an' oil an diamonds 'cause we need them every day
Recognize it, we pimpin' as we ridin'?

Girls them a page me waan fi raise me
True me write nuff tune and drive them crazy
Well I man a true born Jamaican
Ready fi the girls them inna every situation

We a the gal dem pro, them know we flow
With the lyrical content that make them dip low and
Make the club keep jumpin'
Turn up the bass make we here when it pumpin'

Summertime bounce to the music people choose it
Sean da P gal a cruise with... well reputed cause?
We a the girls them champion
And got nuff a them like the great king Solomon

Many girls inna my eye sight sexy dress type
When them ready fi a hype night
Just gimme di light an'
Make we blaze in the roof we haffi raise it again

We be burnin' not concernin' what nobody wanna say
We be earnin' dollars turnin'g cau we mind deh pon we pay
Haulin' gold an' oil an diamonds 'cause we need them every day
Recognize it, we pimpin' as we ridin'?
