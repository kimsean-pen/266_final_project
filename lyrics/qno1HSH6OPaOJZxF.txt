Time is on my side
Yes, it is
Time is on my side
Yes, it is

Now you always say that you want to be free
But you'll come running back
(Said you would baby)
You'll come running back
(I said so many times before)
You'll come running back to me

Oh, time is on my side
Yes, it is
Time is on my side
Yes, it is

You're searching for good times
But just wait and see
You'll come running back
(I won't have to worry no more)
You'll come running back
(Spend the rest of my life with you, baby)
You'll come running back to me

Go ahead, go ahead and light up the town
And baby, do everything your heart desires
Remember, I'll always be around
And I know, I know
Like I told you so many times before

You're gonna come back, baby
'Cause I know
You're gonna come back knocking
Yeah, knocking right on my door
Yes, yes!

Well, time is on my side
Yes, it is
Time is on my side
Yes, it is

'Cause I got the real love
The kind that you need
You'll come running back
(Said, you would, baby)
You'll come running back
(I always said, you would)
You'll come running back to me

Yes, time, time, time is on my side
Yes, it is
Time, time, time is on my side
Yes, it is

Oh, time, time, time is on my side
Yes, it is
I said, "Time, time, time is on my side"
Yes, it is

Oh, time, time, time is on my side
Yeah, time, time, time is on my side
