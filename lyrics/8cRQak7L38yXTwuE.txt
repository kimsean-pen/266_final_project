WelcAme to the fourth Dimension
(My) reality hits you like an embarrassing question
Boy with a mission, Inspired by fiction
Action-reaction, owner of Repression
Am I right or wrong? Am I weak or strong?
So many questions, all night long
Rhyme after rhyme after rhyme I try to find myself
Chapter two: Gotta make a confession

All together
Yo!

My lyrics drink mangas like earth drinks rain
Infiltrating my roots, anaesthetized the pain
Le noyau est dur, pur, l'alliage est en Métal
Obstiné comme Seiya, fondamental
"Kaléidoscope Hypnotique" quand les autres voient binaire
Leur carrière est fixe, nos mouvements sont stellaires
Negative attitude meets positive vibes
One symbol, Northstar rise

All together
Yo!

Times are gonna change
But change takes time
Time is a weapon
For those who want to rise
So rise
And rise
And rise
And rise

Rise for my crew
Rise for my homies
Our vision is pure cause we follow nobody
There are no rules, time does no mercy
I wanna rule the game like my boy Sakuragi
Fuck the cliché, Manga Mania
Northstar worldwide, omniscient as Shaka
Open your eyes, this is the new era
What's up Shibuya?
Yo!
