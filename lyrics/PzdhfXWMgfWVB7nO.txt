Go to work...

Sunlight wakes me up, I say good morning
Then I'm rolling, I'm so holding on to you
7: 45, the day is dawning
Tell me what I gotta do
To get you up in the morning
Get you up in the morning
Get you up in the morning
Tell me what I gotta do
To get you up in the morning
Get you up in the morning
Tell me what I gotta do

Why don't you go to work?
Do your 9 to 5
Gotta treat me right
You need to earn your stripes
Why don't you do your thing?
Bring the money home
Just like mama done
Why don't you go to work?

Why don't you go to work?
Do your 9 to 5
Gotta treat me right
You need to earn your stripes
Why don't you do your thing?
Bring the money home
Just like mama done
Why don't you go to work?

Now you're acting up
I think you're stalling
Appreciation boy, that's all I need from you
Don't apologize
Just give me something
Tell me what I gotta do
To get you up in the morning
Get you up in the morning
Get you up in the morning
Tell me what I gotta do
To get you up in the morning
Get you up in the morning
Tell me what I gotta do

Why don't you go to work?
Do your 9 to 5
Gotta treat me right
You need to earn your stripes
Why don't you do your thing?
Bring the money home
Just like mama done
Why don't you go to work?

Why don't you go to work?
Do your 9 to 5
Gotta treat me right
You need to earn your stripes
Why don't you do your thing?
Bring the money home
Just like mama done
Why don't you go to work?

When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love, when I come home
When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love, when I come home
When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love, when I come home
When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love, when I come home
When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love, when I come home
When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love, when I come home
When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love, when I come home
When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love, when I come home
What I gotta do?
