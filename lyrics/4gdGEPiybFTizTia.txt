I saw how they killed at those Parties
I know how they devoured Bodies
No Fear, the Slayers are waiting
Don't go, they'll be finding you to kill you

I know how they raped in Orgies
You'll have Fear when you Dance at this Party
If You Dance on the Floor Covered with the Blood, You're Lost

You won't be free
They're killing anybody
You'll have fear when you dance at this Party
Dead Men and perverse Party running

You're Lost

They Kill only Pleasure
