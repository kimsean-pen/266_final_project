Try I might, I'm looking at patterns I read off my bedroom walls (inside)
I'll never find a love while I'm sleeping inside

Take aim, I guess it's no secret, I'm feeling defeated I (try)
I'll never find a love while I'm sleeping inside

I hope you follow across the things you hear from me
We're drifting apart
Screaming here in confidence
Challenged
I've tried trailing off to eternity
You're thinking I've learned to
Spot the difference in your point of view
But if you can't realize
The things you miss in front of you
Then I can't even try
To wonder a guarantee

Here you go
You saw this was pending
It sounds condescending, but
You'll never be impartial if
You're taking sides
