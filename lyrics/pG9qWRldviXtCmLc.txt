In a little café
Just the other side of the border
She was just sitting there and givin' me
Looks that made my mouth water
So I started walking her way
She belonged to bad man, José

And I knew, yes I knew I should leave
When I heard her say, yeah
Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer

I'm all alone
And the night is so long

So we started to dance
In my arms, she felt so inviting
That I just couldn't resist
Just one little kiss so exciting
Then I heard the guitar player say

"Vamoos, José's on his way"
And I knew, yes I knew I should run
But then I heard her say, yeah

Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man

So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone
And the night is so long

Then the music stopped
When I looked the café was empty
Then I heard José say

"Man you know you're in trouble plenty"
So I dropped my drink from my hand
And through the window I ran
And as I rode away
I could hear her say to José, yeah

Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone
And the night is so long
La-la-la-la la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la la-la-la-la
Ho-ho la-la
La-la-la-la-...
