The day they covered us in the dirt
Like stars in the ground that will grow into dead flowers
The day they covered us in the dirt
Like stars in the ground that will grow into dead flowers

Your body's on me like sleepless spiders
Your touch is so empty, your touch is so empty
Your body's on me like sleepless spiders
Your touch is so empty, your touch is so empty
Your touch is so empty, your touch is so empty

I've been running from the bloodless for fear of exile
For all of my sorceries that shun the light, that shun the light
I've been running from the bloodless for fear of exile
For all of my sorceries that shun the light, that shun the light

The day they covered us in the dirt
Like scars in the ground that will grow into dead flowers
The day they covered us in the dirt
Like scars in the ground that will grow into dead flowers

I've been running from the bloodless for fear of exile
For all of my sorceries that shun the light, that shun the light

I've been running from the bloodless for fear of exile
For all of my sorceries that shun the light, that shun the light
I've been running from the bloodless for fear of exile
For all of my sorceries that shun the light, that shun the light
I've been running from the bloodless for fear of exile
For all of my sorceries that shun the light, that shun the light
I've been running from the bloodless for fear of exile
For all of my sorceries that shun the light, that shun the light

Light, light, light, light
