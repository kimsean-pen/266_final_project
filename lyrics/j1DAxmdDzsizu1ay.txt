Chorus 1
My head keeps turnin' turnin'
Like Russian roulette
Thoughts are like bullets
I cannot do this... do this... do this... do this... do this

Chorus 2
How do I feel like? Alright, probably going home
Gonna make it the same
Gonna make it my love time... make it my love time...

Chorus 3
Cause this is the right world
This is the wrong world
This is the one world
This is the dark world
This is the sun world
This is the sun word
Can you become girl? Here in this fun world.

Psychosomatic Imagine having shadows swooping inside us
And mirrors cracking
The shudders was a trappin
Having tea with Alice and Rabbit Im on the mirror
I'm jealous chemically Im imbalanced until I channel
Tracking through the heart of the devil
My?
My thoughts are spinnin' from brellas to higher levels
Severed from your lovin' I'm troubled I talk to no one
And no one told there's no one Happening in the volcom
Where I'm not supposed ta With padded rooms like a sofa
They told me it's for my own good
My voices are on my shoulder
Planet of the vultures divulgin' To keep revolvin'
The spotted Works on my focus My culture, but no one knows it
This is why I'm focusin' mostly upon my my own shit.
I told you I'm not the culprit I'm the only one you notice
Walkin across the ocean makes no suprise no commotions
I'm in a place that you noticed
I'm goin outta my marbles

How do I feel like? Alright, probably going home
Gonna make it the same
Gonna make it my love time... make it my love time...

Cause this is the right world
This is the wrong world
This is the one world
This is the dark world
This is the sun world
This is the sun word
Can you become girl? Here in this fun world.

Mix it up with the alpha hits
Now me Smokey

They give us ya rim be a second trips
From nigel back to the Yuka Streets
I get ya loco everywhere we go
They juxtapose?
Easier Than None
Get down and boogie
Hey there Susie
...I like the way you movin'

My head keeps turnin' turnin'
Like Russian roulette
Thoughts are like bullets
I cannot do this... do this... do this... do this... do this

My head keeps turnin' turnin'
Like Russian roulette
Thoughts are like bullets
I cannot do this... do this... do this... do this... do this

Whats in there you think is so cool?
Party people? Truce
Lets suffer a little two on two
Maybe tried to rule
But noone gave it back to you
I seem to be?
Find you much better too

How do I feel like? Alright, probably going home
Gonna make it the same
Gonna make it my love time... make it my love time...

How do I feel like? Alright, probably going home
Gonna make it the same
Gonna make it my love time... make it my love time...

Cause this is the right world
This is the wrong world
This is the one world
This is the dark world
This is the sun world
This is the sun word
Can you become girl? Here in this fun world.

How do I feel like I'm
Alright probably going home
Gonna make it the same
Gonna make it my love's time... my love's time...

How do I feel like I'm
Alright probably going home
Gonna make it the same
Gonna make it my love's time... my love's time...
