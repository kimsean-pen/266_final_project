Ancient walls of flowers tumblin' down,
Black cat petals and a smiling clown.
I like to keep them in a jar beside,
Just enough to mess my mind inside.

But I never heard you callin' from the sun.
Did you ever care to shoot your silver gun?
No, I never heard you callin' from the moon.
Did you ever care to sing your free love tune?

Ancient walls of whispers falling low,
Murmur simmer and I'm feeling slow.
Keep me up, but keep me in my head.
I'll ping a pound of posies 'til I'm dead.

But I never heard you callin' from the sun.
Did you ever care to shoot your silver gun?
No, I never heard you callin' from the moon.
Did you ever care to sing your free love tune?

Ancient walls of flowers tumblin' down...
Ancient walls of flowers tumblin' down...
Ancient walls of whispers tumblin' down...
Ancient walls are tumblin' all over this town.
