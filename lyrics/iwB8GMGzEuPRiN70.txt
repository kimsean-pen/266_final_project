I met this boy in Molly town
He said a boom, a boom, boom, boom
He said he'd like to buy my round
I said OK, but you can't buy me baby
You look just like my favourite sound
So I stay alalala
Asking if I was allowed to come and play
The rest is history

What is a girl like me to do - ooh, ohh
Not for a second I can leave you - ooh, ohh
Been here a month and I know your smile - ooh, ohh
My heart is thinking I'll stay a while - ooh, ohh, ooh, oooh

The weeks went on and the months fell out
Of my way, what can I sing about it
You swore you'd always be around
If I stay, so I'm staying (sing?)
I hold my plans to the god of fate
And all he say was boom, boom, boom
You're the point to the love I found
In a way, don't think I'm crazy

What is a girl like me to do - ooh, ohh
Not for a second I can leave you - ooh, ohh
Been here a month and I know your smile - ooh, ohh
My heart is thinking I'll stay a while - ooh, ohh, ooh, oooh

O-e-o, o-e-o, o-e-o-o-o-o
O-e-o, o-e-o, o-e-o-o-o-o
O-e-o, o-e-o, o-e-o-o-o-o
O-e-o, o-e-o, o-e-o-o-o-o

Got my camera, got my six
Let me go I'm leaving it
Run from life fast
Cause you got me, got me, got me transfixed
Thought I'd travel far away
But you call me half the way
Down in? I would stay
Cause you got me, got me, got me good babe

What is a girl like me to do - ooh, ohh
Not for a second I can leave you - ooh, ohh
Been here a month and I know your smile - ooh, ohh
My heart is thinking I'll stay a while - ooh, ohh, ooh, oooh

I'll never let you go
Boy, you're my comfort child
I'll never let you go
No, no, ooh

I see our love's been a locket, there's no talk if I stop it
You just don't want to see me go
Every look I've been docking, on your door I've been knocking
Get your life and baby let's go, go

I met this boy in Molly town
He said a boom, a boom, boom, boom
He said he'd like to buy my round
I said OK, a boom, boom, boom
