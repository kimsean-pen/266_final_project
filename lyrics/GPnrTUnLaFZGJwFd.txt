Lights wanted, wailing we
Wept high as the sky
And the sky
Beloved, weeping eye
Gazed high in the sky
And the sky cried back

There's a missing man
Easy to find (Easy to)
There's a missing man
Easy to find, with eyes like mine

I've wanted orphan tears
Like mine, raise the tide
Raise the tide
Once-wishing, wistful eye
Sang high, raise the tide
'Til the sea's mouth dried

There's a missing man
Easy to find (Easy to)
There's a dying man
Easy to find, with eyes like mine

Sickened by these sharks
Sickened by these crimes
Sickened by these eyes
Quite resembling mine

There's a missing man
Easy to find (Easy to)
There's a dying man
Easy to find, with eyes like mine
