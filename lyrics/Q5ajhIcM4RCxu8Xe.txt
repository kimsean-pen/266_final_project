There was a time when I brought light to your eyes
Even the worst of days could not keep us apart
And you weren't afraid to spill those evil thoughts
Even the ones that made you question who you are

You feel it, eyes racing, my feet were buried in the ground
My chains break, I can't take the sounds
I don't feel like I still have anything to hold me here
My steps fade, she can't take the sound

The good days fade, the bad ones take
And break the spirits we once shared
Every touch feels empty now
You took my words and they cut deep
And keep replaying in your head
I'm moving mountains as you drown

You feel it, eyes racing, my feet were buried in the ground
My chains break, I can't take the sounds
I don't feel like I still have anything to hold me here
My steps fade, she can't take the sound

You feel it, eyes racing, my feet were buried in the ground
My chains break, I can't take the sound (the sound, the sound)
I don't feel like I still have anything to hold me here
My steps fade, she can't take the sound
