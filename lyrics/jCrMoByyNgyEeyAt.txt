Signs, signs are lost
Signs disappeared
Turn invisible
Got no sign
Somebody got busted
Got a face of stone and a
Ghostwritten biography

Dogs started rushin' in
Hungry for some food
Dogs started twitching
And they're looking at you

It was light by five
Torn all apart
All in the name of democracy
He's hurt, he's dying
Claimed he was a terrorist
Claimed to avert a catastrophe

Someone should've told him
That the buck stops here
No one ever said
That he was involved with thieves

They're blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind

No sense of harmony, no sense of time
Don't mention harmony, say
"What is it? What is it? What is it?"
Give a little shock, and he raises his hand
Somebody shouts out, says
"What is it? What is it? What is it?"

He was shot down in the night!
People ride by but his body's still alive
The girl in the window, what has she done?
She looks down at me and says
"I don't wanna die!"

And I'm blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind

Somebody could have told us where they go
Crawling all around looking for foot, foot, footprints
Now tell me what the hell have we become?
Some dirty little bastards, what the hell is going on?

No sense of harmony, no sense of time
Don't mention harmony, say
"What is it? What is it? What is it?"
Give a little shock, and he raises his hand
Somebody shouts out, says
"What is it? What is it? What is it?"

He was shot down in the night
People ride by but his body's still alive
Girl in the window what has she done?
She looks down at me and says
"I don't want to die!"

An' it's blind and they're blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind

Blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
And I'm blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
