Infected, a growing madness thrives in all.
Towing towards sirens, an endless calling thirst.
Promised warmth, pleasures, wealth.
To be kept blindfolded and led on in the perfect state of equilibrium.
While towering mountains and deep waters crumble.
As virtue and wisdom wither to dust.
Once beyond measure, boundless and omnipresent.
When fruits bear no seed and the earth yields no fruit.
