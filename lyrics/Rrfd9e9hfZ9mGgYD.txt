Time Has Come Again
Time has come again
And love is in the wind
Like some music in a dream
You made them all come true
When you came inside of my life
Now i'm lost
Inside of you
Lost in the music
And lost in your eyes
I could spend all of my time
Hearing songs you sing
Feeling love you bring
Darling being close to you
Made all ...
Made all my dreams come true
When you came inside my life
Now i'm lost inside of you
