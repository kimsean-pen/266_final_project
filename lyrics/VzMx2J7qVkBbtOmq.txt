the old man posed this question
How can I solve the puzzle he
just didn't I mention when he spoke in riddles here!

I hate these statues with my own name on
to ashes they will burn!
The fire of my lonely heart will hold the flame on
and I will return!

Why's there a statue carved for me
I'm not dead I'm alive and breathing!
I won't take this without a fight
They're not the ones who just can turn off my life light!

I hate these statues with my own name on
to ashes they will burn!
The fire of my lonely heart will hold the flame on
and I will return!
I look at the sky covered with storm clouds,
clouds made of fire
the ash rains down like snow, ashes to ashes,
it covers the grove

From these ashes
I'll grow my own groveand
I will be rising, like a Fenix from the glow!
"The statues will burn and my fate will turn"
"I will call it the Ash Grove!'

"And I look,
I look at the sky covered with storm clouds, clouds made of fire!
the ash rains down like snow, ashes to ashes,
it covers the grove
