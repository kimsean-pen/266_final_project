Fire and forgive
We all
Fire and forgive
We call
Fire and forgive

Sons of god and sacrament
The night we're dying for
By the call of pyromania
Bring fire into war

Rest in flame by testament
At midnight we return
Raising fodder for the living
The trail of life we burn

And we bring fire, sing fire
Scream fire and forgive
Forgiving the liar, by fire we live
We bring fire, sing fire

Scream fire and forgive
The last of the blood we will give
Fundamental armament
The price we all ignore

Bring to fallen as the savior
To son of god we swore
Once ignited out of it
The beast we all can tame

By the whitest of the holy lore
Come praise the lord in flame
And we bring fire, sing fire
Scream fire and forgive

Forgiving the liar, by fire we live
We bring fire, sing fire
Scream fire and forgive
The last of the blood we will give

Fire, fire, fire and forgive
Fire, fire, fire and forgive
Fire and forgive

We all
Fire and forgive
We call
Fire and forgive

And we bring fire, sing fire
Scream fire and forgive
Forgiving the liar, by fire we live

We bring fire, sing fire
Scream fire and forgive
The last of the blood we will give.
