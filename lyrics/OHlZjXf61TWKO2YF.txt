you wait
you wait
you wait for summer
then you wait for rain

you wait
you wait
you wait for darkness
then you wait for day
yeah you wait

you wait
you wait
you wait

and she says
patience, darling
patience, patience
it will come

you wait
you wait
you wait for august
then you wait for may

you wait
you wait
wait to get there
then you wait to play

you wait
you wait
you wait for someday
that'll make the waiting
worth the wait

the wait
you wait

and she says
patience, darling
patience, patience
it will come

Ahh, Ahhh, Ahhh,
Ahhh-ohh, Ahhh-ohh
Ahhh-ohh
