Time, time, time, it's a poison,
'Cause you and I have forgotten,
That love, love, love is a put on,
And time, time, time only goes on.

Love, love, love, it's a poison,
When you and I turn to nothing.
And time, time, time only goes on,
When love, love, love is forgotten.

We are all wanting of the eyes that would show us,
We are all wasted on the words that console us,
We are all waiting for the hands that will hold us.

Time, time, time it's a poison,
When you and I turn to nothing.
And love, love, love only goes on,
When time, time, time is forgotten.

We are all wanting of the eyes that would show us,
We are all wasted on the words that console us,
We are all waiting for the hands that will hold us.

Time, time, time, it's a poison...
Love, love, love is forgotten...
