I saw the ...with the light in your eyes
Yeah you were singing about, something
I hear your man, see you look that way
The music won t save you
And now I m talking to god
About rock and roll
But dear old god don t listen

Yeah music won t save you
Smoke is in your eyes
There s something in your right hand
The music won t save you
Look away, away from the light
I m not trying, trying to lie
I hear your man immitate a song
Yeah music won t save you.
