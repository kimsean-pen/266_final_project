I came from a place
Where everyone knows your name
Where people decide your fate
So I stay away
From those who love to blame
From those who play the games
Like you

I'm going crazy in this cage you put me in
But I'm done, I'm done

Oh baby you, you can call me
Whatever you want, whatever you wish
But you're never gonna shake my confidence
'Cause I don't give a damn about the things you say
Oh baby you, you can call me
Whatever you want, whatever you wish
But you're never gonna shake my confidence
'Cause I don't give a damn about the things you say
Oh baby you, baby you
Call me whatever you want, whatever you wish
I'm confident

I was a kid who just wanted to fit in
But no one was listening
So now I learned how to trust and love myself
I'm not going to pretend no more, no more

I'm going crazy in this cage you put me in
But I'm done, I'm done

Oh baby you, you can call me
Whatever you want, whatever you wish
But you're never gonna shake my confidence
'Cause I don't give a damn about the things you say
Oh baby you, you can call me
Whatever you want, whatever you wish
But you're never gonna shake my confidence
'Cause I don't give a damn about the things you say
Oh baby you, baby you
Call me whatever you want, whatever you wish
I'm confident

You can call me whatever you want but I'll be what I want
So whatever, whatever you can judge me
Your words don't touch me
You talk about me but I know myself better
You can call me, can call me, can call me
Whatever, whatever
You can call me, call me
Oh baby you, you can call me whatever you want

Oh baby you, you can call me
Whatever you want, whatever you wish
But you're never gonna shake my confidence
'Cause I don't give a damn about the things you say
Oh baby you, you can call me
Whatever you want, whatever you wish
But you're never gonna shake my confidence
'Cause I don't give a damn about the things you say
Oh baby you, baby you
Call me whatever you want, whatever you wish
I'm confident

You can call me whatever you want but I'll be what I want
So whatever, whatever you can judge me
Your words don't touch me
You talk about me but I know myself better
You can call me whatever you want but I'll be what I want
So whatever, whatever you can judge me
Your words don't touch me
You talk about me but I know myself better
