And this time you cross the line leaving me in the dark
But, I will light the way without you (without you)
And this time I realize you could have had my heart.
But I'm not going down without you.
You were putting on a show, putting on a show.
So I'd rather be alone, rather be alone.
Take another step and I'll lose it.
Sick of hearing all your excuses.
Breaking down your walls, breaking down your walls.
I'm not waiting for your call, waiting for your call.
Say another word and I'll lose it.
Everything you do is so useless.
Before I have to go, before I have to go.
I just wanted you to know, wanted you to know.
You're on your own.
This time I'll let it slide.
Not gonna fall apart.
I'm alright, I'm just waiting until I get you.
I lied when I said that everything was alright.
Don't drag this out for another night.
Well I should have known that you would move on and on and on without me.
Take another step and I'll lose it.
Sick of hearing all your excuses.
Breaking down your walls, breaking down your walls.
I'm not waiting for your call, waiting for your call.
Say another word and I'll lose it.
Everything you do is so useless.
Before I have to go, before I have to go.
I just wanted you to know, wanted you to know.
You're on your own.
How did it blind us to the end?
Never saw right through it.
A dose of your own medicine.
So read my lips.
You're on your own.
You're on your own.
You're on your own.
You're on your own.
You're on your own.
You're on your own.
You're on your own.
Take another step and I'll lose it.
Sick of hearing all your excuses.
Breaking down your walls, breaking down your walls.
I'm not waiting for your call, waiting for your call.
Say another word and I'll lose it.
Everything you do is so useless.
Before I have to go, before I have to go.
I just wanted you to know, wanted you to know.
You're on your own.
