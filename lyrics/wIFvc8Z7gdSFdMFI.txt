I was feeling alone
Staring at the sun
Crowds of people walk on by
What a feeling to rise above clouds
Ashes falling around the town
Burning up

rolling down along the corner
Does it ease you now around the town
Everything is about living a long time
The sun rises and hears about what
Things won't work out

I 'm feeling fine
Sitting in the sun
Drops of rain and please won't come

Fading's on my mind

Thoughts were on pleasing and working out
There wanna see
Fading into? on my mind
