Hey Take it slow
I've been waiting for a while
I can't let you go
I don't wanna cry no more
날 잡아끄는 손
이대로 멈췄으면
We can try
Let's give it right
I'm feeling small
Don't look at me
You know I'm feeling down
Feeling down
I love you so
Don't far from me
You know I'm feeling down
I wanna let go
I'm feeling small
Don't look at me
You know I'm feeling down
Feeling down
I love you so
Don't far from me
You know I'm feeling down
I wanna let go
I wanna color you
Color you
I wanna color you
Color you
Baby Hold me close
I've been waiting for a while
I want to be special
I'm the one who makes you bright
흔들리는 너의
맘을 채우고싶어
We can try
Let's give it right
I'm feeling small
Don't look at me
You know I'm feeling down
Feeling down
I love you so
Don't far from me
You know I'm feeling down
I wanna let go
I wanna color you
Color you
I wanna color you
Color you
I wanna color you
Color you
I wanna color you
Color you
Color you
Color you
