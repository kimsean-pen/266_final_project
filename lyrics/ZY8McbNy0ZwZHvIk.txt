Dreams stay with you
Always on my mind
I got a lust for lies
Seasons bring truth
When I found mine, it was summertime
It's the middle of the night and I'm so gone
And I'm thinking about how much I need you
But you really want somebody else
Should be given the right to carry on
I'm still thinking about how much I need you
But you really want somebody else

You're not the one
Guess you're not the one

Streets like a zoo
Through a city of lights, love at first sight
Silent rays of blue
They slowly glide
Right down my spine
It's the middle of the night and I'm so gone
And I'm thinking about how much I need you
But you really want somebody else
Should be given the right to carry on
I'm still thinking about how much I need you
But you really want somebody else

You're not the one
Guess you're not the one
You're not the one
Guess you're not the one

I was enjoying the ride
And now we're standing on the graveside
Left unsatisfied
I won't even bother to fight
I know you're not the one

You're not the one
You're not the one
You're not the one
You're not the one
Guess you're not the one
You're not the one
Guess you're not the one
You're not the one
