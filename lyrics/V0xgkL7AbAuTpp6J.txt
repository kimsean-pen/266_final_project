There a boy I like south of the river
That doesn't leave his house the morning up till noon
Not even when the flowers are in bloom

We could take a stroll or just share, you know
I just want to be your lady, oh come home soon
They say I'm a fool

I'm standing in the cold without a coat, but
I just won't go down, down, down
Down down down

Let me show you the beat of my heart
Let it start, let it start
Let me show you the beat of my heart
Let it start, let it start

Maybe the stars will go our way
Lover, I will never ever let you stray
And I hope to see you some day

We could watch the night sky fade to blue
Listen to your heart
And maybe you will break through
Breaking the rules

Even though I'm standing in the rain without a coat, but
I just won't go down, down, down
Down down down

Let me show you the beat of my heart
Let it start, let it start
Let me show you the beat of my heart
Let it start, let it star

Come and get the keys to my heart
Let it start, let it start
Let me show you the beat of my heart
Let it start, let it star

Slowly show you the beat of my heart
Let it start, just let it start
Let me show you the beat of my heart
Let it start, let it start

And you could be the first time I need a chart
Just let it start, let it start
Let me show you the beat of my heart
Let it start, let it star

Do let's show you the beat of my heart
I just won't go down, down, no, down
Down down down
