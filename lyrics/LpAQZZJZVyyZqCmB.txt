You complete my fate
The world unwinds inside of me
You complete my fate
The halo crawls away
You repeat my fate
Rewinding all we can
You refill my place
You refill my place, place
Come and save me
Come and save me
Come and save me
Come and save me
Come and save me
You complete my fate
The heavens stroll inside of me
You repeat my fate
Revealing who we are
You refill my place
You refill my place, place
Come and save me
Come and save me
Come and save me
Believe in me and drink the wine and take my hand and fill me up
Come and save me
Believe in me and drink the wine and take my hand and fill me up
Come and save me
Believe in me and
Drink the wine and
Take my hand and
Fill me up
Believe in me and
Drink the wine and
Take my hand and
Let me follow
