Too many options can be fun
Yeah I know 'cause I got a few of 'em
But if you have to pick just one
Just be good at competition, they ain't nothin'

You just want that energy
I can make plans for your pleasure
But you gotta make a decision, oh

You just want that energy
I wanna make plans for your pleasure, yeah girl
But you gotta make a decision, ooh, yeah
Too many options ain't good for you

You don't play hard well, just give in
You see the wave I'm on and I know you're drippin'
You see they blow me up, got they minds made up
Ignore another call 'cause your body wants it all
