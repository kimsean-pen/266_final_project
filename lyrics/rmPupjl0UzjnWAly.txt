What did you think would happen?
When you put me in unnatural space
A cruel dark box where a shadow took my place

Monday is January, Friday is December
The calendar means nothing, when you can't remember who you are
Who you are, losing hope, not sure what to believe
If the lost ever knew broke where you've been
It's getting old loving everyone else, more than you love yourself

But if you never break, you'll never know
It's all you need to fight a blow
Now put yourself back together again
Burning bridges from the inside-out
One day I'll be stronger than my own doubt
Stronger than my own doubt

But if you never break, you'll never know
It's all you need to fight a blow
Now put yourself back together again
What did you think would happen?
