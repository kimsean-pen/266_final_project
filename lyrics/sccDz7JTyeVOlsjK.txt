I never wanted to be President
Because it's nothing but an ego trip, yeah
I didn't want your education
Because it's nothing but a pile of shit

You bore me to death,
So shut up for God's sake

Stop reading me the riot act
While my brains are still intact
You say it's raining,
But you're pissing down my back
So stop reading me the riot act

I couldn't listen to a word you said
This goin' nowhere thing is wearing thin
When your sex, your drugs
And your valid vic'
Is just the spit I wipe off my chin

I'd rather go nowhere
Than not know where it's at

Stop reading me the riot act
While my brains are still intact
You say it's raining,
But you're pissing down my back
So stop reading me the riot act

I never wanted to be President
Because it's nothing but an ego trip, yeah
I didn't want your education
Because it's nothing but a pile of shit

You bore me to death,
So shut up for God's sake

Stop reading me the riot act
While my brains are still intact
You say it's raining,
But you're pissing down my back
So stop reading me

Stop reading me the riot act
While my brains are still intact
You say it's raining,
But you're pissing down my back
So stop reading me the riot act

The riot act
The riot act
The riot act
