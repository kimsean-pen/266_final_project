Meeting in this way who could have known
How our destinies and ways apart have grown.

Looking still the same after all these years changing only in
my memories not clear

And believing all futures we would share

Fate design playing natures mime and today by chance we
meet again after all this time

Meeting in this way no-one could have known.

Sharing thoughts and deeds simple harmony plans and
hopes erased in our maturity

Now tomorrow's dreams are now yesterday.

Fate design playing natures mime and today by chance we
meet again after all this time

Meeting in this way no-one could have known.
