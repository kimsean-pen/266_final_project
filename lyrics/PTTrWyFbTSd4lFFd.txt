It falls apart
from the very start
It falls apart
Falls apart

Everything around me
falls apart
It falls apart
from the very start
It falls apart
Seems like everything I touch
Falls apart

Everything around me
falls apart
When I walk away from you

I wish I could, but I don't
always keep the promises I've kept
I wish I could, but I can't
always give, whatever I have left
And now its all so clear
doesn't anyone see whats happening here?
It falls, apart

from the very start
It falls apart
seems like everything I touch

Falls apart
Everything around me
falls apart
When I walk away from you
When I walk away from you
I know I should, but I don't always say
what you want me to say

I know I could, but I don't
always act like everything's ok
And now its all so clear
doesnt anyone see whats happening here?
It falls, apart
from the very start
It falls apart
Seems like everything I touch
falls apart
Everything around me
falls apart

When I walk away from you
When I walk away from you
When I walk away from

Everything I
have ever been made of
hates who I am
I'm so glad you waited
can't get my mind
off how you could love me
I'm so behind

you're so far above me
and you'll always be
the wind under my wings
above me
and you'll always be
the wind under my wings
above me

I will not let it go to waste
I'm takin all I got
and leavin' this place
and I will not let it go to waste
I'm takin all I got
and leavin' this place
and I will not, be takin' up space
I'll take my best shot
I'm pickin up the pace
and
It falls, apart
from the very start
It falls apart
seems like everything I touch
falls apart
Everything around me
falls apart
When I walk away from you
It falls apart
from the very start
It falls apart
seems like everything I touch
Falls apart, everything around me
falls apart
When I walk away from you
When I walk away from you
When I walk away from
You
