It's so nice to see old friends
'Cause we've all gotten very much higher
It's so nice when you come around again
Sits, and laugh, have a smoke by the fire
I know it won't be long
I know it won't be long
I know it won't be long
Before we're one
It's so nice to see you again
Though the world be a little bit colder
Still it's fun, we should meet here again
Stay a while, rest your head on my shoulder
I know it won't be long
I know it won't be long
I know it won't be long
Before we're one
It's so nice to see old friends
Yes we've all gotten very much higher
It's so nice when you come around again
Sits, and laugh, have a smoke by the fire
I know it won't be long
Yes I know it won't be long
Come on, I know it won't be long
Before we're one
