Knock shop in Oxford Street
One where the vampires meet
Silk purse, pink tie and all of that
Platforms, white teeth, a stupid hat

They really like to see you there
You make them think you really care
But I've watched you take your make-up off
Your face grows hard
Your eyes grow soft

The window blinds are drawn
You flash your trash to turn me on
I sigh and frown and start to cough
Your hunger starts to turn me off

Lie down and try to talk to me
Sleep now and dream of who you'll be
When you finally become someone

You're tuned into my frequency
That don't mean a thing to me
'Cause I don't want your body
I don't want your body

You sold me some cheap ecstasy
So you could have some sex with me
I don't want your body
I don't want your body

Face down upon the bar
I always said you'd get far
But you're not the kid you used to be
Someone should call your family

White line dead time the chloroform
Flashbulbs which pop to keep you warm
I've watched you slowly fall away
The colours fade from blue to grey

The window blinds undrawn
You flash some trash to turn us on
You're just a tramp, we're just a trick
Our hunger starts to make us sick

Liedown and try to talk to me
Sleep now and dream of who you'll be
But will you actually be anyone?

You're tuned into my frequency
That don't mean a thing to me
'Cause I don't want your body
I don't want your body

You sold me some cheap ecstasy
So you could have some sex with me
I don't want your body
I don't want your body

You tune into my frequency
That don't mean a thing to me
'Cause I don't want your body
I don't want your body

You sold me some cheap ecstasy
So you could have some sex with me
I don't want your body
I don't want your body

We don't want your body
