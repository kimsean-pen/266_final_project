Go ahead and keep the, yeah
See you sweat, see you sweat, hah, hah, hm

Go ahead and keep the lights on
I just wanna (I see you sweat)
Just keep the lights on, yeah (I see you sweat)
Hands up like black and whites come
Go ahead and clap your hands like you tryna fight some, son
Go ahead and keep the lights on
I just wanna (I see you sweat)
Just keep the lights on (I see you sweat)
Hands up like black and white's con
Go ahead and clap your hands like you tryna fight some, son

First off, uh, bow down
'Cause this feel like Midnight Club in D-town, wassup?
DUB Edition, new keys in the ignition
My hat tippin', Dontrelle Willis with the feet kickin'
Her knees cranking, you see what P cranking, uh
I mean, listen, uh, y'all be trippin', uh
See, we'll lately been seeing y'all be grading, uh
I mean, face it, y'all niggas is cheap fragrance
They know me, the phonies
They copy, they jocking
But Groggsie, he just drinking Carlo Rossi
And the pretty boy finna end the title reign - Arturo Gatti
We in this thing with the whole posse
And this fit just asking niggas to just rob me
And these kicks just asking niggas to start rockin'
But you ain't gotta ask a nigga, you just watch me

Go ahead and keep the lights on
I just wanna (I see you sweat)
Just keep the lights on, yeah (I see you sweat)
Hands up like black and whites come
Go ahead and clap your hands like you tryna fight some, son
Go ahead and keep the lights on
I just wanna (I see you sweat)
Just keep the lights on (I see you sweat)
Hands up like black and white's con
Go ahead and clap your hands like you tryna fight some, son

Yeah, Henny out the bottle, I don't need no glass
This is all me, so please don't ask
Ballin' on a budget, gotta make this last
Nick driving reckless, hoping we don't crash
Pull up mad deep with all my niggas
My lil bro just dropped your rent on Denim
In the back, with my feet up kicking
Belly out, with my shirt, that's linen
I'm just tryna vibe, yeah, we out here giggin', uh
2-stepping, just out here killin'
Gettin' hot in here, plus the Henny done kicked in
I need to slow down, 'fore your boy gets kicked out
Still feeling myself, just socializing
But you better not ask me to start freestyling
Honestly, I don't like the nightlife full
Since I'm here, I guess I'll enjoy the lights like you

See you sweat, see you sweat
See you sweat, see you sweat
Go ahead and keep the lights on (I see you sweat)
I just wanna (I see you sweat)
Just keep the lights on (I see you sweat)
Hands up like black and whites come (I see you sweat)
Go ahead and clap your hands like you tryna fight some, son (I see you sweat)
Go ahead and keep the lights on (I see you sweat)
I just wanna (I see you sweat)
Just keep the, yeah, yeah (I see you sweat)
Lights on, son, son (I see you sweat)
Go ahead and keep the lights on, I just wanna see you sw... (uh)

Go ahead and keep the lights on
I just wanna (I see you sweat)
Just keep the lights on, yeah (I see you sweat)
Hands up like black and whites come
Go ahead and clap your hands like you tryna fight some, son
Go ahead and keep the lights on
I just wanna (I see you sweat)
Just keep the lights on (I see you sweat)
Hands up like black and white's con
I just wanna (see you sweat, see you sweat)
