Everybody know I'm bringing the facts
And they wonder why I got it like that
Cause I put everything right on the track
And you know I'ma fuck around and let it go
I been living like woah I been living you already know
And these motherfuckers wanna take up on every mistake
And I'm showing where I'm going
And I'm knowing what I'm doing
Intuition never switching
On a mission, motherfucker why is you bitching?
Why is you bitching?
Like God damn I'm like (oh God)
Hold up wait a minute they ain't ready for the hook
It's another day, another book
I feel like Indiana in Atlanta hotter than Havana
Coming with the stamina
Bitch put down your camera
And live in the moment
This shit right here everybody gon' want it
So what up with it?
Any and everybody talk about that boy changing
Y'all can just shut up with it cause I know
Ain't none of y'all getting the flow

Boy this that flexicution

Young boy, from the, from the, from the God
This that flexicution

From the rap God, from the, from the, from the God

Till I heard you talking shit, now I'm fired up
