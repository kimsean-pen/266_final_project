The pale ghosts as our hosts are gone
And the journey's begun
To the sun
We keep our thoughts in the clouds and fly
Beneath the sky
We made this right

You will find it's a new day
And you, you will find it's a new day

The clouds move fast
We are sky sailing
Our ship is flying like a storm
Gods, look at our cast
We are sky sailing
The fury of the sky is born

The golden dunes look unreal from here
We are sailing high
To the sky
The treasure, the city of gods is there
Above the stars
And we've come from afar

You will find it's a new day
And you, you will find it's a new day

The clouds move fast
We are sky sailing
Our ship is flying like a storm
Gods, look at our cast
We are sky sailing
The fury of the sky is born

So many of my few smiles
Begin with you
You're one of a kind

So many of my few happy days
I have shared with you
I love how you're so dark
Dark are our hearts
And who knows if we have met?
There somewhere some other time
When we were different in
So many ways

The clouds move fast
We are sky sailing
Our ship is flying like a storm
Gods, look at our cast
We are sky sailing
The fury of the sky is born
