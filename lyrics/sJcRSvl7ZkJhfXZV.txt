I turn around, but not to change direction
Another step and we'll be on our way to
the center of, the center of attention
cheap hearts are always on their way out

We shut, we shut, we shut it down
We knocked it off, we knocked it 'round
Let's get this heads up of the ground

Someday worse we're driving
It's a shame to lay in on a day like this
Let's go out and face it
looking like disgraces on a day like this

No, it never is quite enough
So, you never did fall in love
Oh, I think a little too much

We turn around, but we don't change direction
Another step and we'll be on our way

We shut, we shut, we shut it down
We knocked it off, we knocked it 'round
Let's get this heads up of the ground

Someday worse we're driving
It's a shame to lay in on a day like this
Let's go out and face it
looking like disgraces on a day like this
