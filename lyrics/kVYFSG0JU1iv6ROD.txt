I wanted to believe that I could be anyone.
But I'm lonely when I'm not alone.
And obviously there's no danger in having hope,
Having hope in anyone but me.
On a better day, I would be way more awake.
Falling off, I'm losing faith.
If it's all the same, I will just take my things anyway.

If this is love, if this is love,
Then I would run far, run fast, from me.
Forgive me if I leave the keys.

I knew I would let you down.
I'd betray your confidence, how much do you trust me now?
No.
Well everyone else here sees, your eyes they can't perceive me.
I hate the sound of your voice, cause it still haunts me like a ghost.
But I know that I'm to blame, cause I've never been anyone else.
But I'm not done cause I like your way
Cause I know I'll never change.

If this is love, if this is love,
Then I would run far, run fast, from me.

I never said I was an angel.
There's a simple explanation for it all.
It's all my fault.
The snow melts away, I'm close to the ending now.
I don't want to be saved.

If this is love, if this is love,
Then I would run far, run fast, from me.
Forgive me if I leave the keys.
