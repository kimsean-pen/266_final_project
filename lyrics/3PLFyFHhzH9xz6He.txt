You can't keep God off the radio
Don't let him in
You can't keep the Devil from the media
Don't let him in
There is always a salesman at the front door
Don't let him in
The church is trying to peddle something much worse
Don't let them in

What you see
And what you believe
Are never gonna be the same

The spiders
The monsters
The demons
The suggesting tapeworm
You don't like us do you?
But you can't find us can you?

There is always a salesman
There is always a sale
There's a devil
And a family on their knees tonight
