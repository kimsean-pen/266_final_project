Fallen like a hammer on a solitary ark
It struck a nail and now we'll never be apart
Just a shadow on the wall

And I curse the ground beneath my feet
Curse the boiling sea
Curse the stars above my head
Staring back at me
Damn the windy curtain split
Damn the head behind it

Wait for me by my gallow's pole
Hang around, I won't be long

Borderlines
Get me out alive
Petty rage
I am right where I belong

I'm sorry but the voice inside my head won't let me go
I know you won't forgive me
For the things you'll never know
Come back to me sweet Abigail
Hurry up and find me

Wait for me by the iron rail
Hold on

Borderlines
Get me out alive
Petty rage
I am right where I belong

Cross the borderline
The architect stopped by his design
I never fell so hard
Could be the ice I could hesitate to climb

Borderlines
Gets me out alive
Calming rain
By the wilderness
