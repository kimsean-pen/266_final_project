It's been a long time comin'
It's goin' to be a long time gone

And it appears to be a long
Appears to be a long
Appears to be a long
Time, it's a long, long, long, long time
Before the dawn

Turn, turn any corner
Hear, you must hear what the people say
You know there's something that's goin' on around here
It surely, surely, surely won't stand the light of day, no

And it appears to be a long (Yes, it does)
Appears to be a long (Mmm)
Appears to be a long
Time, such a long, long time before the dawn

Speak out, you've got to speak out against the madness
You've got to speak your mind
If you dare
But don't, no, don't, no, try to get yourself elected
If you do, you have better cut your hair, mmm

And it appears to be a long (Yes, it does)
Appears to be a long (Mmm)
Appears to be a long
Time, such a long, long, long, long time before the dawn, yeah

It's been a long (long) time (time) comin' (comin')
It's goin' to be long (a long) time (time) gone (gone)

But you know
The darkest hour
Is always, always just before the dawn

And it appears to be a long
Appears to be a long
Appears to be a long
Time, such a long, long, long, long time
Before the dawn
