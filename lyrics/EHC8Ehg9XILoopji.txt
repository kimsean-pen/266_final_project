You speak to me
I know this will be temporary
You ask to leave
But I can't tell you that I've had enough
I can't take it
This welcome is gone
And I've waited long enough
To make it
And if you're so strong
You might as well just do it alone
And I'll watch you go

Step up to me
I know that you've got something buried
I'll set you free
You set conditions, but I've had enough
I can't take it
This welcome is gone
And I've waited long enough
To make it
And if you're so strong
You might as well just do it alone
And I'll watch you go

Come back home, won't you come back home?
You step in line, you got a lot to prove
It comes and goes, yeah, it comes and goes
A step in time, yeah, it's a lot to move

Know this will be temporary
I know this will be temporary
I know this will be but I've had enough

I can't take it
This welcome is gone
And I've waited long enough
To make it
And if you're so strong
You might as well just do it alone
And I'll watch you go

I can't take it
This welcome is gone
And I've waited long enough
To make it
And if you're so strong
You might as well just do it alone
And I'll watch you go
