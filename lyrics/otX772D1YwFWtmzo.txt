I'm afraid that I gotta do what I gotta do
But if I let you go, where you gonna go?
We gotta make it change, time to turn the page
Something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you

We've been through couple times, you know it gets worse
We can turn this around, please let me be first
And as I feel your tears spilling on my shirt
Something isn't right I don't wanna fight you

Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causing you pain too but
Remember if you need to cry
I'm here to wipe your eyes

Tonight before you fall asleep
I'll run my thumb across your cheek
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
Oh oh
'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

When did we cross the line
How could we could forget
Why do we let the pressure get into our heads
Your broken heart requires all of my attention
'cause something isn't right I don't wanna fight you

Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causing you pain too but
Remember if you need to cry

I'm here to wipe your eyes
Tonight before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay

Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
Please don't lose your faith
Don't worry 'cuz I'm here to keep you safe
I promise if you let me see your face

That I won't let you down, I won't let you down
I'm here to wipe your eyes
Tonight before you fall asleep
I'll run my thumb across your cheek
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
