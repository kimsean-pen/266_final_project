Here's to the babies in a blind new world,
Here's to the beauty of the stars
Here's to the travelers on the open world
Here's to the dreamers in the bars
Here's to the teachers in the crowded rooms
Here's to the workers in the fields
Here's to the á¹—reachers of the sacred word
Here's to the drivers at the wheels
Here's to you my love let the day begin
Here's to you my love with blessings from above, let the day begin

Here's to the winners of the human race,
Here's to the losers in the game
Here's to the soldiers of the bitter world
Here's to the water that's their names
Here's to you my love let the day begin
Here's to you my love with blessings from above, let the day begin
Day begin, day begin, day start

Here's to the doctors and their healing work
Here's to the loved ones in the can
Here's to the strangers on the streets tonight
Here's to the lonely everywhere
Here's to the whistle from the mouths of bets
Here's to the lions and their kids
Here's to the struggles of the silent war
Here's to the clouding of age
Here's to you my little love, let the day begin
Here's to you my little love, let the day begin
Here's to you my little love, let the day begin
Here's to you my little love, let the day begin
Here's to you my little love with blessings from above
Let the day begin
Here's to you my little love with blessings from above
Let the day begin
Here's to you my little love with blessings from above
Let the day begin
Here's to you my little love with blessings from above
Let the day begin
