You breathe, I breathe you in
I like a lot where you been
I make, you break the rule
You got e-rot-tickle cool
Give a little bit get a little bit
Take it for a ride, yeah
When you push love so far away
It eats you up inside
There's a girl living under my skin(JA JA JA)
There's this girl and she's wearing me thin(JA JA JA)
And I think she's the reason
That it's open broken hearted season
There's a girl, there's a girl
I know, you know you are
You are the oo in la la
Blow a little kiss, know a little bliss
Get a little high, yeah, yeah
And I can't get you out of me
Because you're too deep inside
There's a girl living under my skin(JA JA JA)
There's this girl and she's wearing me thin(JA JA JA)
And I think she's the reason
That it's open broken hearted season
You can spend your whole lifetime
You could be never more mine
There's a girl, there's a girl
There's a girl, there's a girl
Get a little bit
Give a little bit
Get a little high, yeah
When you push love so far away
It eats you up inside
There's a girl living under my skin(JA JA JA)
There's this girl and she's wearing me thin(JA JA JA)
And I think she's the reason
That it's open broken hearted season
There's a girl, there's a girl(JA JA JA)
There's a girl, there's a girl(JA JA JA)
And I think she's the reason
That it's open broken hearted season
(talk box interlude)
There's a girl, there's a girl(JA JA JA)
There's a girl, there's a girl(JA JA JA)
There's a girl, there's a girl(JA JA JA)
There's a girl, there's a girl(JA JA JA)
There's a girl, there's a girl
There's a girl, there's a girl
