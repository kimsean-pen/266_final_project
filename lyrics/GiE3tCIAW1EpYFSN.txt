31 years old so I done been through all that dizzert
Came up off the porch straight serving off the cizzurb
Long time ago, I don't do that shit no mo'
This the last time I'mma tell you, wanna hear it?
(Here it goes!)
It was me and Baby James
With an ounce to our name
Rollin' up to all the dimes, same clothes from yesterday
Had a smoke around a custo, paid his ass a stone
When the narcs came and raided hid on the roof and smoked bong
Fuck with rap bitches
Head from 'em hunnids'
Lost a sack but I got back cause the dice game was hittin'
It was me and Carbo breakin' day in the lobby
Nigga puffin' old dope sellin' rocks as a hobby
Bankroll in my pocket so everybody know me
Went home and gave my mama three hundred for some groceries
We hit the mall and ball
Hit the club and spend it all
Now I'm back to Square A
With them squares to get off

Dope Song
Dope Song, Dope Song
(My last)

Dope Song
Dope Song, Dope Song
(My last)

Dope Song
Dope Song, Dope Song
(My last)

Dope Song
Dope Song, Dope Song

Crackhead Lisa
She used to be thick
Had sex with a trick, and now she sick
She offer you some head if you give her some drugs
Just make sure you when you hit it you better wear a glove
I'm sick of all these niggas with their ten year old story
You ain't doin' that mo', nigga long time??
So take this as a diss song, cause this is my last song
Not my last dope song, but my last dope song

Dope Song
Dope Song, Dope Song
(My last)

Dope Song
Dope Song, Dope Song
(My last)

Dope Song
Dope Song, Dope Song
(My last)

Dope Song
Dope Song, Dope Song
