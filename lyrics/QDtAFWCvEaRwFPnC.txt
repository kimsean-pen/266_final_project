in the blackened waters of conceit
i saw my silhouette pale and bleached
all thin outlines and no shape
dash the surface for the self to show
displays a vague shadow i should know
unless you define me
there's no faith

continue the line i draw
fill in the missing mark
without you you
i am who
build me up all nice and tall
lift me up and make me soar
out of the blue blue
i'll be new

here we spent every resource
against the current, change the course
with no land in sight
give me pace
owning up to each letter spelled
rewrite the story that i now tell
come let's run from the chase

continue the line i draw
fill in the missing mark
without you you
i am who
build me up all nice and tall
lift me up and make me soar
out of the blue blue
i'll be new

across the bottomless blue
seeking the truth i turn to you
reflected back in all your shine
a making of your design

continue the line i draw
fill in the missing mark
