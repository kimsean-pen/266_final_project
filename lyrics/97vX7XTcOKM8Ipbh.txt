As I enter on the path of no return
I embrace the reclaiming call of the dawn
Now, born by evil's burning flame
Eternity; I give my name

Ravening storms from hell burn and crush the pitiful slime
In a blaze of death to destroy all creations of life
Ancient dust rising in for their destruction by flame
Behold the coming of chaos which comes to feast on the lives of we all

It casts my deadly shadow upon the creation
Again the ancient demons arise
I grow, grow racked with infernal powers
Obliterate, perpetual deimse

Ravening storms from hell burn and crush the sinful slime
In a raze of death to destroy all creations of life
Ancient dust rise again, return for destruction by flame
Behold the coming of chaos which comes to feast on the lives of we all

Eternal death, envoke thine wrath
Bring forth perpetual demise
Infernal flames, destroy all
Satan's wrath, chaos roars

Ravening storms from hell burn and crush the pitiful slime
In a blaze of death to destroy all creations of life
Ancient dust rising in for their destruction by flame
Behold the coming of chaos which
comes and feast on the lives of we all

Eternal death, envoke thine wrath
Bring forth perpetual demise
Infernal flames, destroy all
Satan's wrath, chaos roars

Eternal death, envoke thine wrath
Bring forth perpetual demise
Infernal flames, destroy all
Satans wrath, chaos roars
