Led by temptation into the underworld
to absence of season and time
Soldiers of Fortune, Soldiers of the Night
back to back, ready to fight
Enchanted gardens, where Evil slipped away
through darkness, fire and rage
Uncanny demons will dance upon your grave
as soon as you become their slave
Surrender or fight, there's nowhere to turn
The Bringer of Light, where are you now
Forever our hearts will burn
Immortal Riders, Protectors of the Earth
lost in the abode of the dead
Misled through darkness and mislead by desire
inside the midst of the fire
Surrender or fight, there's nowhere to turn
The Bringer of Light, where are you now
Forever our hearts will burn
Fallen Angels, arise from your graves
Free your spirits and unite
before the blood of the Unicorn colors the night
From the ruins of hell we shall rise
On The Edge Of Honour we see the light
of the Unicorn soaring the night
Lead: both
Born to conquer the fight
here we stand with the Future in our hands
Through fire, we'll rise to touch the sky
Solo: Stefan
Ooh, oooh, ooh...
Seeker of danger, it's too late to withdraw
Our journey has come to an end
Lets stand together put trust in thy sword
Victory will marching toward
Surrender or fight, there's nowhere to turn
The Bringer of Light, where are you now
Forever our hearts will burn
Fallen Angels, arise from your graves
Free your spirits and unite
before the blood of the Unicorn colors the night
From the ruins of hell we shall rise
On The Edge Of Honour we see the light
of the Unicorn soaring the night
Lead: both
