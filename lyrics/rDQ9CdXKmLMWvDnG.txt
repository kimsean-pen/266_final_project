My friend flip
Gave a gift to me:
Oblong box
Plastic made
Mostly tin
Cheap electronics
Plug it in
With blinking lights
A hum within
Want
Remover
Want
Remover
Those judges shows I used to like
Continue on but I don't mind
Actors playing both parts
Judge Mathis would never stand for it
My want remover
My want remover
And I'm free free free free from want
And I'm free free from fear
Drain me out and I don't care
Machine is working for me
What I swallow and what I eat
I pay no mind
Who's elected throw them on a spear
Device is almost full
It's my want remover
And I'm free free free free from thought
And I'm free free from action
As it starts to leak
I worry about the carpet
