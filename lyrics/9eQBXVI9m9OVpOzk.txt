Gone to the coast
Gone to the coast
Where I let my hair down
Out on the beach
Out on the beach
Where I let my ship sail

(x2)

Cause I don't know what I want
I don't know what to think with
Both the curtains drawn
I dunno about you
Tell me somthing that I'm supposed to do

Runners don't run to me
Runners don't say the same old things

Racers don't bother me
Racers don't say the same old things
But you always do

Gone to the coast
Gone to the coast
Where I let my hair down
Out on the beach
Out on the beach
Where I let my ship sail

(Instrumental Break)

Gone to the coast
Gone to the coast
Where I let my hair down
Out on the beach
Out on the beach
Where I let my ship sail

Cause I don't know what I want
I don't know what to think with
Both the curtains drawn
I dunno about you
Tell me somthing that I'm supposed to do, to do

(Outro)
