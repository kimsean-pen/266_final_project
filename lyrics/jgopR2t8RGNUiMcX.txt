I've still got those country feelings
And their roots are in my soul
When I'm so tired I can't take it
Of this life that I've been sold

I turn off the world around me
And go drifting back in line
As those same old country feelings
Just come flowing across my mind

I remember to this day the bright red Georgia clay
How it stuck to the tyres after the summer rain
Will power made that old car go
A woman's mind told me that it's so
Oh, how I wish we were back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travellin' and livin' off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love bein' a free man

I can still recall the wheat fields of Saint Paul
And the mornin' we got caught robbin' from an old hen
Old MacDonald, he made us work
But then he paid us for what it was worth
Another tank of gas and back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travellin' and livin' off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love bein' a free man

I'll never forget that day we motored stately into big L.A.
The lights of the city put settlin' down in my brain
Though it's only been a month or so
That old car's buggin' us to go
You gotta get away and get back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travellin' and livin' off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love bein' a free man

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travellin' and livin' off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love bein' a free man

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travellin' and livin' off the land
