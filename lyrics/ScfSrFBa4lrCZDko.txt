There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she
Turns out to be
Someone who watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the woods
I know I could, could always be good
To one who watch over me
Although I may not be the man some girls think of
As handsome
But to her heart
I'll carry the key
Won't you tell her please to put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh how I need

Someone to watch over me
Won't you tell her please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead

Oh how I need
Someone to watch over me
