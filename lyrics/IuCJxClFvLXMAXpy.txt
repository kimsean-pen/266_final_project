I miscalculated
Distracted by the prize
I patiently waited
You broke yours
But I kept mine

Oh, well I felt miserably

Oo, I felt miserably

Now I take back my offer
Stand in line
But where I go you follow
Hanging from my mind

Oh, well I felt miserably

Now I bathe in my misery

Oh, well I felt miserably

Now I bathe in my misery.
