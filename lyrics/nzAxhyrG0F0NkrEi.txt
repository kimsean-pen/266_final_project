Cause I'm dying here
You were lying
It was you and I forever
But now you make me shiver in the light

And I'm dying here
And I'm crying for the you that I remember
But now you make me shiver you're so...

Am I meant to sit here and just take this
When you promised me
I would be the one that
You would never leave
Can't believe I felt for what you said
Does it make you feel good to make me feel like less than I am?
Does it make you feel strong?
Like you're a bigger man?
What did I do to deserve you to shut me out?
Did I love too much?
Is that what this is about?
I used to thank god every morning for having you in my life
And now I'm praying just to forget you
And you know why

Cause I'm dying here
You were lying
It was you and I forever
But now you make me shiver in the light

And I'm dying here
And I'm crying for the you that I remember
But now you make me shiver you're so...

Cold
Cold
Cold

And if you were gonna lie
At least be a man and lie to my face
So you can watch my tears turn to blood as I tear myself apart
Wondering why
Why I ever fell for you
Put myself though hell for you
Fuck you, I hate you
I love you, I need you
I want to run
I want to run
I want to run, But I don't wanna run if you're not gonna find me
So we should just pretend to be friends, right?
And fake our way to the bitter end

Cause I'm dying here
You were lying
It was you and I forever
But now you make me shiver in the light
And I'm dying here
And I'm crying for the you that I remember
But now you make me shiver you're so...

Cold
Cold
Cold

And I'm dying here
And I'm crying for the you that I remember
But now you make me shiver you're so...

Cold
Cold
Cold

Now you make me shiver in the light

And I'm crying here
And i'm crying
For the you that i remember
But Now you make me shiver you're so...

Cold...
