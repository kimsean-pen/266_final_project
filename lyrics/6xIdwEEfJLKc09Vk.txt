Fallen trees after hurricane
Endless field below
We can wait when it starts to rain
Just to see the glow
You can follow a thousand lights
But it has no end
We will never-never-ever realize
How we reached this land
Soft clouds

Like our dreams we will fade away
You cannot resist
We can wait 'till uncertain lane
Disappears in mist
You can run a thousand miles
But it has no end
I have never seen this wonder in your eyes
Let me take your hand
Soft clouds

I don't want to miss your soul
And when we die we'll still be forever together
You know
I don't want to miss your soul
And when we die we'll still be forever together
You know
