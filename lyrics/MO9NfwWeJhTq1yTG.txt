There will be those times we fight back tears
And there will be those times when we get scared
As long as we're together we'll get there
Cause love never fails...
Love never fails...
I have all that I need
So much so I feel weak
Cause the love that we have is never ending
All the moments we make
Are too precious to waste
In a world that is forever changing

I wouldn't change you for anything
I will be forever loving you

There will be those times we fight back tears
And there will be those times when we get scared
As long as we're together we'll get there
Cause love never fails...
Love never fails...

A sleep or awake
No there's never a day
That goes by when I don't think about you
Only you touched my life
For the very first time
I'll be lost surely without you

I wouldn't change you for anything
I will be forever loving you

There will be those times we fight back tears
And there will be those times when we get scared
As long as we're together we'll get there
Cause love never fails...
Love never fails...
Love never fails...
Oh! Yeah
Love never fails...

There's no greater gift
Than love that you breathe
Forever hold me
Many rivers to cross
But our love will guide us
It's all we need
It's all we need

There will be those times we fight back tears
And there will be those times when we get scared
As long as we're together we'll get there
Cause love never fails...
Love never fails...

There will be those times that test our faith
On some of the roads that we have to take
But I know that we'll always find our way
Cause love never fails...
Love never fails...
