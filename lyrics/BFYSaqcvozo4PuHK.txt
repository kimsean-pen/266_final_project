Hear the sound
The angels come screaming
Down your voice
I hear you've been bleeding

Make your choice
They say you've been pleading
"Someone save us"

Heaven help us now
Come crashing down
We'll hear the sound
as you're falling down

I'm at this old hotel
but can't tell if I've been breathing or sleeping
or screaming or waiting for the man to call
and maybe all of the above
'Cause mostly I've been sprawled on these cathedral steps
while spitting out the blood and screaming
"Someone save us"

Heaven help us now
Come crashing down
We'll hear the sound
as you're falling down

And will you pray for me?
Or make a saint of me?
And will you lay for me?
Or make saint?

'Cause I'll give you all the nails you need
Cover me in gasoline
Wipe away those tears of blood again
and the punchline to the joke is asking
"Someone save us"

Heaven help us now
Come crashing down
We'll hear the sound
as you fall

And would you pray for me?
(You don't know a thing about my sins)
(How the misery begins)
Or make a saint of me?
(You don't know)
(So I'm burning, I'm burning)
And will you lay for me?
(You don't know a thing about my sins)
(How the misery begins)
Or make a saint?
(You don't know)
('Cause I'm burning, I'm burning)
'Cause I'll give you all the nails you need
(I'm burning, I'm burning again)
Cover me in gasoline again
