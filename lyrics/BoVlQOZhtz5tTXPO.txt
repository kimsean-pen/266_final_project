Sometimes I don't know where
This dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I don't know the reason why
So I guess I'll keep gambling
Lots of booze and lots of rambling
Well, it's easier than just waiting around to die

Well, one time, friends
I had a ma, I even had a pa
He beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried
She told him to take care of me
She headed down to Tennessee
Well, it's easier than just waiting around to die

Then I became of age
And I found a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar
She cleaned me out and she hit it on the sly
Well, I tried to kill the pain
I bought some wine, I hopped a train
Well, it was easier than just waiting around to die

Then a friend said he knew
Where some easy money was
We robbed a man and brother, did we fly
But the posse caught up with me
And drugged me back to Muskogee
And now it's two long years, just waiting around to die

Now I'm out of prison
And I got me a friend at last
And he don't steal or cheat or drink or lie
Well, his name is Codeine
And he's the nicest thing I've seen
And together, we're gonna wait around to die
