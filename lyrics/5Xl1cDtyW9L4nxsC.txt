Put your face up to the window
Tell me all about your gay folks
It feels better when you in it
If your nervous use the pay phone
Put your face where we can see it
Put it on a show on cable
You can really show it all there
Turn it on when you are able
Turn it on, turn it on and all the way up
Turn it on in your houses when you wake up
Turn it on when you ain't got no relation
To all those other stations, turn it on
Put your life into a bubble
We can pick you up on radar
Hit a satellite with feeling
Give the people what they paid for
Turn it on, turn it on and all the way up
Turn it on in your houses when you wake up
Turn it on when you ain't got no relation
To all those other stations, turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on and all the way up
Turn it on in your houses when you wake up
Turn it on when you ain't got no relation
To all those other stations, turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on and all the way up
Turn it on in your houses when you wake up
Turn it on when you ain't got no relation
To all those other stations, turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on and all the way up
Turn it on in your houses when you wake up
Turn it on when you ain't got no relation
To all those other stations, turn it on
