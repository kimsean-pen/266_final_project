Honey honey get the kids in the car now
Put the cash in the trunk get the keys lets go.
Hit the biggest bank in Chicago for all it had,
we're the theives you know.

Remember the thing that I told ya,
three years two moons ago?
Promise I'll be right behind you,
but you're gonna die if you don't hit the road.

Keep your lights down,
keep your voice down low.
Wear your hair down,
whichever way you go
And I'll meet you in Idaho.

Three kids in the back of a Cadi,
she said come here and kiss your wife.
I know you're real mad at me,
but you're on your way to some kind of life.
Daniel, John, and Abbi,
promise me you'll treat your mother nice.

Keep your lights down,
keep your voice down low.
Wear your hair down,
whichever way you go
And I'll meet you in Idaho.

And I know you'll miss me I'm barely fifty
Ain't comin with me are all the debts I owe.
Don't have to kiss me just bare with me
And I'll be back someday I hope.

And I know you'll miss me I'm barely fifty
Ain't comin with me are all the debts I owe
Don't have to kiss me just bare with me
And I'll be back someday I hope

Oh I hope.

Ohhhhhhhh

I hope
