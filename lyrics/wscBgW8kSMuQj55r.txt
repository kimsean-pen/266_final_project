The words have been drained from this pencil,
Sweet words that I want to give you,
And I can't sleep, I need to tell you goodnight!

When we're together I feel perfect
When I'm pulled away from you I fall apart
All that you say is sacred to me
Your eyes are so blue, I can't look away
As we lay in the stillness
You whisper to me, amy marry me,
Promise you'll stay with me.
Oh you don't have to ask me, you know you're all that I live for
You know I die just to hold you, stay with you
Somehow I'll show you, that you're my night sky
I've always been right behind you
Now I'll always be right beside you

So many nights, i've cried myself to sleep
Now that you love me I love myself
I never thought I would say this
I never thought there'd be you
