Scarlet now
The color of blood
Ripped from the ground
With selfish thoughts
Ooh the dying sound
Cutting away every single thorn
Without a feeling of mourn
Craving roses
Greedy and cruel
Ooh I'm coming for You
Roses
Wandering free
Ooh which one will It be
Scarlet once the color of sweet
Smelling petals
Now drained from all scent
Waiting for the bitter end
With a low and humble bow
You are all mine now
Craving roses
Greedy and cruel
Ooh I'm coming for You
Roses
Wandering free
Ooh which one will It be
Roses
Greedy and cruel
Ooh I'm coming for You
Roses
Wandering free
Ooh which one will It be
And then at last
Preserved and dry pressed
Forever lasting
Dried out and dead
Forever lasting
Dried out and dead
And then at last
Preserved and dry pressed
Forever lasting
Dried out and dead
Forever lasting
Dried out and dead
Craving roses
Greedy and cruel
Ooh I'm coming for You
Roses
Greedy and cruel
Ooh I'm coming for You
Roses
Wandering free
Ooh which one will It be
Roses
Greedy and cruel
Ooh I'm coming for You
Roses
Wandering free
Ooh which one will It be
Which one will It be
