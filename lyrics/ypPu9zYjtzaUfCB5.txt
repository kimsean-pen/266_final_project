Takin' it slow
Savin' up, she
Before she knows it
All I ask before she goes home

She's tired of cryin'
And sick of his lies
She's suffered him
For far too many years of her life

Feelin' low
And scared that he'll say
Do you know how
Over time you drove her away?

I'm savin' up for
The day when she goes
The day that she stands up
For everything that she chose

She can say, she can say, she can say
She can say, she can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?

She can say, she can say, she can say
She can say, she can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?

She can say, she can say, she can say
She can say, she can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?

She can say, she can say, she can say
She can say, she can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say

Savin' up for
The day when she goes
The day that she stands up
For everything that she chose

Takin' the kids
Drivin' away
Turn around the life
She let him siphon away

And I've been with you
For all of these years
Tell you what I've got
To show for all of my tears

The times you hurt me
And treated me wrong
Something had to give
To stop this thing from goin' on

She can say, she can say, she can say
She can say, she can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?

She can say, she can say, she can say
She can say, she can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say

She can say, she can say, she can say
She can say, she can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?

She can say, she can say, she can say
She can say, she can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?

She can say, she can say, she can say
She can say, she can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?

She can say, she can say, she can say
She can say, she can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say

She's tired of cryin'
And sick of his lies
She's suffered him for
Far too many years of her life

And feelin' low
And scared that he'll say
Do you know how
Over time you drove her away?
