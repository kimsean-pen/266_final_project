It's been so long I've been out of my body with you ...
I feel alone feel at home feel like nothing is True.
You take me to a Place where my senses gave-way
turn it round shut it down what the people say
Climbing up coming down gonna give you some
take my hand and let it come let it come let it...
Take it back when she knows that your doing it right
Cuz everbody else knows what their taking tonight...

But I just wanna bring it round
We we're gonna get there Tonight

I'ts been so far I've been walking the line of my own
Wake me up to the stars we are coming home
I know we had a chase but were out of time
We have sold in the cold Physical Desires
Set me free set me out on the run
lift me up to the sun to the sun to the...
When your burning down when your burning down
It's the way that you think that I know I'ts too late

But I just want to bring it round
We were gonna get there Tonight
I just want to Take You Down
We were gonna Bring You Round.

But I just want to Bring It Round
We were gonna get there tonight.
