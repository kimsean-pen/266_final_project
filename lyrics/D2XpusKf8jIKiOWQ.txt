I possess nothing
I'm free from fear
I'm a monument to myself
I see you drowning
Half flesh half stone
With ambitions that drain your health
You hear me
You run from me
You hear me
I know
You hear me
You run from me
You know
You know
You know
It's in your eyes when you're perfectly sane
It's in your blood when you can't bear these
It's in your eyes when you're perfectly sane
It's in your blood when you can't bear these
heavy thoughts again
You recreate me
Cast off my power
I was willing to be weak for you
But you're unholy
You're not yourself
You know
You know
You know
It's in your eyes when you're perfectly sane
It's in your blood when you can't bear these heavy thoughts again
Oh if you could give back, all the days that I lost to you
I'd surrender the way that you begged me
Now I need you to know, how your body reflects in mine
Now I'll never return to the fantasy
It's in your eyes when you're perfectly sane
It's in your blood when you can't bear these heavy thoughts again
