Well I walk upon the river like it's easier than land
Evil's in my pocket and your will is in my hand
Oh your will is in my hand

And I'll throw it in the current that I stand upon so still
Love is all from what I've heard but my heart's learned to kill
Oh mine has learned to kill

Oh I said I could rise
from the harness of our ghost
Here come the tears
but like always, I let them go
oh oh oh
Just let them go

Now spikes will keep on falling from the heavens to the floor
The future was our skin and now we don't dream any more
No we don't dream anymore
oh oh oh

Like a house that's made from spider webs and the clouds are rolling in
You bet this mighty river's both my saviour and my sin
Oh my savior and my sin

Oh I said I could rise
from the harness of our ghost
Here come the tears
but like always, i let them go
oh oh oh
Just let them go

Well I walk upon the river like it's easier than land
Evil's in my pocket and your strength is in my hand
your strength is in my hand
And I've thrown you in the current that I stand upon so still
Love is all from what I've heard but my heart's learned to kill
Oh mine has learned to kill

Oh I said I could rise
from the harness of our ghost
Here come the tears
but like always, i let them go
oh oh oh
Just let them go
