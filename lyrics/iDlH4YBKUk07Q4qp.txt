So fuck your bible and your Babel
I made this psalm into my dirty bomb
So dance, motherfucker, dance
Racing to a red light

I'm un-stabled, I'm not a show horse
I can't be bridled, of course
I'm un-scabbed and un-regretted
I got tattooed in reverse
Woah, in reverse

You can't play this game, you've lost all the pieces
So hold your breath and just wait
(I'm sure) Someone else will pay for your sins
But I'm not convinced by your costume
This ain't my goddamn cup of tears

I'm un-stabled, I'm not a show horse
I can't be bridled, of course
I'm un-scabbed and un-regretted
I got tattooed in reverse
Woah, got tattooed in reverse
Woah, in reverse

Your confession means nothing
So fuck your attrition
There ain't nothing in my hourglass
Just sand from a dead sea
And I made it my weapon
And I made it my weapon

Your confession means nothing
So fuck your attrition
There ain't nothing in my hourglass
Just sand from a dead sea
And I made it my weapon

Fuck your bible and your Babel
I made this psalm into my dirty bomb
So dance, motherfucker, dance
Racing to a red light

So fuck your bible and your Babel
I made this psalm into my dirty bomb
So dance, motherfucker, dance
Racing to a red light

I'm un-stabled, I'm not a show horse
I can't be bridled, of course
I'm un-scabbed and un-regretted
I got tattooed in reverse
Oh! Oh, oh, oh
I got tattooed in reverse
