You carry my casket
Towards each sunset
The current will take
My ashes to a safer place

I'll be forever fond
Of the memories that you hold on
So just climb today
For there's always tomorrow to compensate

Lay in retrospect
I always renege
Lay in retrospect
I always reflect

Approaching the garden
Breaking through the pearly gates
My pockets are bare
Without a chance to compensate

Lay in retrospect
I always renege
Lay in retrospect
I always reflect

In the end
When I look back
I begin
To regret

I look back in retrospect
I always renege
I loom back in retrospect
I always reflect
