Face everything and rise
Face everything and rise

The streets crawl with a deadly omen
Outside I see a world that's broken
I can't breathe, my heart is choking
I need a cure for this life I've chosen

My pain is a blessing in disguise
I feel it cutting and it's cutting like a knife
My pain, my pain is a blessing in disguise
I feel it cutting and it's cutting like a knife

I will face everything and rise
Never gonna quit until I die
Angels keep falling from the sky
I'll take the broken wings and learn to fly
I will face everything and rise
Face everything and rise

The earth shakes and the city's burning
But it feels like the tide is turning
Life hurts and there's no warning
Lightning strikes, my heart is storming

The rain is a blessing in disguise
The flood's coming and it's drowning all the lies
The rain, the rain is a blessing in disguise
The flood's coming and it's drowning all the lies

I will face everything and rise
Never gonna quit until I die
Angels keep falling from the sky
I'll take the broken wings and learn to fly
I will face everything and rise
Face everything and rise

Throw me in the fire but I'll never be the same
I come alive when I am burning in the flames
I'm under fire, finally wide awake
I am protected when I'm walking through the flames
Walking through the flames
Walking through the flames

I will face everything and rise
Never gonna quit until I die
Angels keep falling from the sky
I'll take the broken wings and learn to fly
I will face everything and rise

The pain, the pain is a blessing in disguise
Face everything and rise
The pain, the pain is a blessing in disguise
Face everything and rise
