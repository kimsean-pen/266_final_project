Just when you thought it was over
The sky turned black and we all fell to Earth
Dead in our tracks, we were frozen in fact
Choking to breathe, then came the seas
Wash away impurities
Wash away all that couldn't be

Everyone will be washed away
Drowning in the hell that we made
I cannot believe that our end is so near
Everyone will be washed away
Drowning in the hell that we made
I cannot believe that our end is so near

Standing at the end of our world
Breathing in the chaos behold
None will be found, it's all toppling down
Cities will seethe, none could believe
Wash away impurities
Wash away all that couldn't be

Everyone will be washed away
Drowning in the hell that we made
I cannot believe that our end is so near
Everyone will be washed away
Drowning in the hell that we made
I cannot believe that our end is so near

Save me
Save me from what will engulf this world
Save us
Save us from the end, save us from ourselves
Save me
Save me from what will engulf this world

Just when you thought it was over
The sky turned black and we all fell to Earth

Everyone will be washed away
Drowning in the hell that we made
I cannot believe that our end is so near
Everyone will be washed away
Drowning in the hell that we made
I cannot believe that our end is so near
Everyone will be washed away
Drowning in the hell that we made
I cannot believe that our end is so near
