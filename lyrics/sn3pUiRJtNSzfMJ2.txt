Hey baby what's your name?
Do you wanna play a game?
Play it like we don't know when
We'll ever getto play again
Experimental and so brand new
The things eye wanna do with you
Like a physical kind of blue
Come on baby let's get to it

I want a lover that can improvise
I want a lover that can make me cry

Baby eye don't care what you learned in lovemaking school
U and me we 'bout to jam
Make love like the first woman and man
I don't wanna know ahead of timto
The notes you play should be a reaction 2 mine
Nothing planned or contrived
Then both of us will arrive
At r destination

I wanna feel like eye've been hypnotized
If you think you can then let's go for a ride

Let's go for a ride
Let's go

Love like jazz... love like jazz... love like jazz
