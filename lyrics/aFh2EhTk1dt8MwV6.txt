I will be your savior
When no one will save you
Be a shining light
Going nice
Make you burn all up inside
But there's a space that I'm saving
To keep me strong
There is a place that I'm saving
We can't stay for long
I will be your loadest
Go slow so you don't know this
Out of the dead wood, the disease
Closer and you'll find me
There's a space that I'm saving
To keep me strong
There is a place that I'm craving
We can't stay for long

Find me in the forest
In the fire
Find me in the mid-stop
Your desire
I got love in high places
Love in high places

Find me the secrets
In the lies
Find me the darkest place
In here
I got love in high places
I see you loving in high places

I will be your danger
And you think nothing can change ya
It's kinda technical, physical
We are out your meter
But there's a space that I'm saving
To keep me strong
There is a place that I'm craving
We can't stay for long

Find me in the forest
In the fire
Find me in the mid-stop
Your desire
I got love in high places
Love in high places

Find me the secrets
In the pain
Find me the dryer
In the rain
I got love in high places
I see you loving in high places

I will surely break your heart
This is your friend
