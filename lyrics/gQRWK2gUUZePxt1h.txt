I'm searching for something
That I can't reach
I don't like 'em innocent
I don't want no face fresh
Want them wearing leather
Begging let me be your taste test
I like the sad eyes, bad guys
Mouth full of white lies
Kiss me in the corridor
But quick to tell me goodbye
You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway
My ghost
Where'd you go
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost
Where'd you go
What happened to the soul that you used
To be
You're a Rolling Stone boy
Never sleep alone boy
Got a million numbers and they're filling up your phone boy
I'm off the deep end, sleeping
All night through the weekend
Saying that I love him but
I know I'm gonna leave him
You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway
My ghost
Where'd you go
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost
Where'd you go
What happened to the soul that you used
To be
I'm searching
For something
That I can't reach
I'm searching
For something
That I can't reach
My ghost
Where'd you go
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost
Where'd you go
What happened to the soul that you used
To be
What happened to the soul that you used
To be
