The tar in the street starts to melt from the heat
And the sweats runnin' down from my hair
I walked 20 miles and I'm draggin' my feet
And I'll walk 20 more and I don't care
I'll wander this world, wander this world
Wander this world, wander this world all alone
Alone I'm like a ghost some people can't see
Others drive by and stare
A shadow that drifts by the side of the road
It's like I'm not even there
And I'll wander this world, wander this world
Wander this world, wander this world all alone
Well I've never been part of the game
The life that I live is my own
All that I know is that I was born
To wander this world all alone
All alone
Some people are born with their lives all laid out
And all their success is assured
Some people work had all their lives for nothin'
They take it and don't say a word
They don't say a word
Sometimes it's like I don't even exist
Even God has lost track of my soul
Why else would he leave me out here like this
To wander this world all alone
And I'll wander this world, wander this world
Wander this world, wander this world all alone
