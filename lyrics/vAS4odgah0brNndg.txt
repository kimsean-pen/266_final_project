I'm young
What can I know of the tide turn
How can I wish to descry
All shades of white, all types of gray?

I've sung
To rebels, old men
The poor and rich
And all I can be sure of is
We look for love perpetually

So I'll solely exist
Soulfully grasp each second
I'll take every risk
Disconnect all fear, separateness

I'm done
Trying to win every battle
How can I wish to rejoice
When my mind is stuck in this losing game?

I fall
Deeper and deeper in questions
All of which can only be answered
By living uncertainly

Be here now
Don't look down
Be here with me
