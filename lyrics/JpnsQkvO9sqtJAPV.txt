Every time I think that I'm
The only one who's lonely someone
Calls on me
And every now and then I spend
My time at rhyme and verse and curse those
Faults in me

And then along comes Mary
Mary, Mary
Then along comes Mary
Mary, Mary

And does she want to give me kicks
And be my steady chick and give me pick
Of memories?
Or maybe rather gather tales from all the
Fails and tribulations no one
Ever sees?

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch

When vague desire is the fire in
The eyes of chicks whose sickness is the
Games they play
And when the masquerade is played and neighbor
Folks make jokes as who is most to
Blame today

And then along comes Mary
Mary, Mary
Then along comes Mary
Mary, Mary

And does she want to set them free
And let them see reality from where she
Got her name?
And will they struggle much when told that such
A tender touch of hers will make them
Not the same?

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch

And when the morning of the warning's passed
The gassed and flaccid kids are flung
Across the stars
The psychodramas and the traumas gone
The songs are left unsung and hung
Upon the scars

And then along comes Mary
Mary, Mary
Then along comes Mary
Mary, Mary

And does she want to see the stains the
Dead remains of all the pains she left the
Night before?
Or will their wakin' eyes reflect the lies
And make them realize their urgent cry for
Sight no more?

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch
