Don't put me off cause Im on fire
And I can't quench my desire
Don't you know that
Im burning up for your love
Youre not convinced that that is enough
I put myself in this position
And I deserve the imposition
But you don't even know Im alive
And this pounding in my heart
Just wont die... Im burning up
Im burning up, burning up for your love
Im burning up, burning up for your love
Im burning up, burning up for your love
For your love...
Youre always closing your door
That only makes me want you more
And day and night I cry for your love
Youre not convinced that that is enough
To justify my wanting you
Now tell me what you want me to do
Im not blind and I know
That you want to want me but you can't let go
Come on let go...
Im burning up, burning up for your love
Im burning up, burning up for your love
Im burning up, burning up for your love
For your love...
Do you wanna see me down on my knees
Or bending over backwards now would you
Be pleased
Unlike the others I do anything
Im not the same, I have no shame
Im on fire
Im burning up, burning up for your love
Im burning up, burning up for your love
Im burning up, burning up for your love
For your love...
You know you got me burning up baby,
Burning up for your love
