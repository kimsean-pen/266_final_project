The storm is rushing on me
Here's the blinding flash
I feel so locked and loaded
Let me out, let me out

Wake up in a wasteland
Where the trees are crashing fast
Make or break before the road explodes
Get out
Get out
Of this town

Live faster
Love stronger
Better speed up
Or get blown over
Time's wasting
How much longer
Before I get myself free
On these hurricane streets

Headed for disaster
Way beyond the fear
In the rear view, watch it all just
Disappear disappear

Don't care where I'm headed
Anywhere but here
Won't waste my life
Can't waste another night
In this town
This town

Live faster
Love stronger
Better speed up
Or get blown over
Time's wasting
How much longer
Before I get myself free
On these hurricane-

Leaves are blowing
Down the streets
Wind crawling up our knees
Somebody get the keys
Rain is flowing
From the sky
But no fear in our eyes
We're ready to fly

Live faster
Love stronger
Better speed up
Or get blown over
Time's wasting
How much longer
Before I get myself free
On these hurricane streets

Live faster
Love stronger
Better speed up
Or get blown over
Time's wasting
How much longer
Before I get myself free
On these hurricane streets
