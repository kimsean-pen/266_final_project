Get out of the car, put down the phone
Take off that stupid-looking hat you wear
I'm gonna die if you touch me one more time
Well, I guess that I'm gonna die no matter what

Love people are there, the smell of love is everywhere
You think it's always sensitive and good
You think that I want to be understood
I've got a match, your embrace and my collapse

Beat up the cat if you need someone else on the mat
I put a rock in the coffee in your coffee mug
Which one of us is the one that we can't trust?
You say that I think it's you, but I don't agree with that

Love people are there, the smell of love is everywhere
You think it's always sensitive and good
You think that I want to be understood
I've got a match, your embrace and my collapse

Even when we get along
I've got a match, your embrace and my collapse

Love people are there, the smell of love is everywhere
Why can't you be sensitive and good?
Why don't you want to be understood?
I've got a match, your embrace and my collapse

I've got a match, your embrace and my collapse
