If you spend all your life
Comparing yourself to her
Eventually you will find there's no one like you in this world
I know it's hard
I know it's hard
To understand
But you've got to let it go
The situation's out of your hands
If you spend all your life
Chasing after him
Eventually you will find it was never right to begin
I know it's hard
I know it's hard
To understand
But you've got to let it go
The situation's out of your hands
Sometimes I
Feel like I've
Been living a lie
I always try
But it was never enough
It got so tough out there without you
And now I pace alone in my room
Wondering how to be fine without you
Fine without you
If you spend all your life
Wasting all of your time
Eventually you will drive yourselves out of your mind
I know it's hard
I know it's hard
To understand
But you've got to let it go
The situation's out of your hands
Sometimes I
Feel like I've
Been living a lie
I always try
But it was never enough
It got so tough out there without you
And now I pace alone in my room
Wondering how to be fine without you
Fine without you
Timing was off
Feelings got caught
Now I can't quit
It makes me sick
Said and done
I can't have fun
I'm not fine without you
