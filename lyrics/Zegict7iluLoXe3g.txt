What a beautiful dream
I think I'll stay a while
Won't open my resting eyes
Caught off guard in between
Twilight was rocking me
Good night, hear the symphony
Is the grass of Eden overrated?
The grass of Eden overrated?
Somewhere off in the past
Morning is calling me
And missed it deliberately
Is the grass of Eden overrated?
The grass of Eden overrated?

No one else
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream
No one else
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream to me

With your fingers ablaze
You've got that hunger now
Take me, I'm going down
Underneath the debris
That I'm calling out to you
Do with me what you choose
Is the grass of Eden overrated?
The grass of Eden overrated?

No one else
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream
No one else
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream
No one else
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream
No one else
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream to me

Oh, can't hear me now
Oh, I'm going away
When you wake up
I'll be around
When you wake up
I'll be around
No one else
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream

No one else
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream
No one else
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream
No one else
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream to me
Such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream
Such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream to me
