He was the wizard of a thousand kings

and I chanced to meet him one night wandering.
He told me tales, and he drank my wine
me and my magic man kinda feelin' fine.
He had a cloak of gold and eyes of fire

and as he spoke I felt a deep desire
to free the world from it's fear and pain
and help the people to feel free again.
Why don't we listen to the voices in our hearts
'cause then I know we'd find that we're not so far apart.
Everybody's got to be happy. Everyone should sing
for we know the joy of life, the peace that love can bring.
So spoke the wizard in his mountain home.

The vision of his wisdom means we'll never be alone.
And I will dream of my magic night
And the million silver stars that guide me with their light.
