Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (ah, oh, yeah)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

Thinking really, listen,
my night's pretty lit, but it's just you missing
Wishing that I could be the light in your life
The way still light might breathe through the night
Thoughts of you on my mind
I'm searching and I hope one day I can find
And if no one ever feels good, it's never just right
That's why...
I know I'd go back to you

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I should be every girl living,
I know we left messy, but it all is forgiven
Ringing your line, hoping it will go through,
and maybe one time, we could talk this through
Go back to you
Thoughts of you are on my mind
I'm searching and I hope one day I can find
If no one ever feels good, it's never just right
That's why...
I know I'd go back to you

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)

I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
