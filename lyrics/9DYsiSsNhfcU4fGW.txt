You look different every time
you come from the foam crested brine,
it's your skin shining softly in the moonlight.
Partly fish, partly porpoise,
partly baby sperm whale.
Am I yours, are you mine to play with?

Joking apart,
when you're drunk you're terrific,
when you're drunk I like you mostly
late at night, you're quite alright.
But I can't understand the different you
in the morning when it's time to play
at being human for a while.
Please smile.

You'll be different in the spring,
I know you're a seasonal beast,
like the starfish that drift in
with the tide, with the tide.
So until your blood runs
to meet the next full moon,
Your madness fits in nicely
with my own, with my own.
Your lunacy fits neatly with my own,
my very own.

We're not alone.
