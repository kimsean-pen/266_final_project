This is too hard
Want to erase you!
Clean up my head and move on
It 's taking so long to get rid of you
I've got no patience
World is coming down

And I can't let go
Falling deeper down
With rising speed
It's so hard to breathe

Through the darkest shadows
Into deeper black
No one can find me
But I'm still staring at you

Behind this smile
There's nothing but bitterness
Unseen visions shining through these eyes
Behind this smile
Envy is the only life force
And still we are proud of what we've done

Saw this coming too many times
In my nightmares
Forgot to care
Times of insanity liberate you to understand
And you are finally whole

Behind this smile
There's nothing but bitterness
Unseen visions shining through these eyes
Behind this smile
Envy is the only life force
And still we are proud of what we've done
