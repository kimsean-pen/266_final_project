Just a couple
In the park
Handing out those
games in the dark
Those who walk past...
are only reminded of
...dreams?
a scuffle of ...
can only prove the strength of his charms
Woman you're pinned up
on the wall in front of you
a soldier's life is very tough
he's tender loving when fighting's through

join the professionals

Yes they're really strangers in the night
or they're saying to me if you put up a fight
it's not just a kiss you owe me
it's all this ammunition
oh... I bought you a drink
and well, we're walking hand in hand
Woman you're pinned up
on the wall in front of you
a soldier's life is very tough
he's tender loving when fighting's through

save the professionals
the professionals
save the professionals
the professionals
save the professionals
the professionals

Off duty trip
taking flesh going to let it drip
...on his fingers
shone like the taste that still lingers
flavour of this month's scented...

Woman you're pinned up
on the wall in front of you
a soldier's life is very tough
he's tender loving when fighting's through
