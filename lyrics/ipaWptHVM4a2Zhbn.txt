I'm leaving what I made behind
I'll have to let it speak for itself
Just make sure that I'm remembered
Not for good or bad just not forgotten

If I could lift my arm I'd grab yours
If I could open my eyes I wouldn't do it
I'll never know what it's like to feel safe again

How can you not see me lying here?
How can you not respond?
If you could hear me you'd do something
At least give me a reason to let go
