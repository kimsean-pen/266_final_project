Killers lie in wait for innocent blood
To swallow alive some harmless souls
Walking a crooked path, their wicked names will rot

Evil lives in the dark (its right is doing wrong)
The torment never ends (it never ends)

The fire that burns inside
That's blistering their brains
That makes them sacrifice
That's driving them insane

Trapped in this "no man's land"
Where angels dare to tread
Forever banned to the realms
Of the never dead

There's no one you can trust from this grave
Die with those they swear to defend
Feeding on the ones they'll feed off in the end

Evil lives in the dark (its right is doing wrong)
The torment never ends (it never ends)

The fire that burns inside
That's blistering their brains
That makes them sacrifice
That's driving them insane

Trapped in this "no man's land"
Where angels dare to tread
Forever banned to the realms
Of the never dead

Death sits before you, to press on is suicide
Life spills out of your body, you wither and die
For the rest of your life in the realms of the never dead

The fire that burns inside
That's blistering their brains
That makes them sacrifice
That's driving them insane

Trapped in this "no man's land"
Where angels dare to tread
Forever banned to the realms
Of the never dead
