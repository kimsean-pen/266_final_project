I feel empty
My cup to cheers is alone
You're not with me (come on home, come on home)
When will you be coming home?

I don't wanna sleep in my bed (sleep in my bed, sleep in my bed)
I don't wanna feel free to run (feel free to run, feel free to run)
I won't be comfortable
Because I know that you're gone (I'm coming home, I'm coming home)

And don't you make me feel guilty
Insufferable pain (that's the sound of the chains)
Don't you make me feel guilty
I'll love you the same (that's the sound of the chains)

You're incarcerated
While you're there hold on to your mind
With a little bit of faith and patience (have a little faith, have a little faith)
You'll be back in no time

I don't wanna sleep in my bed (sleep in my bed, sleep in my bed)
I don't wanna feel free to run (feel free to run, feel free to run)
I won't be comfortable
Because I know that you're gone (I'm coming home, I'm coming home)

And don't you make me feel guilty
Insufferable pain (that's the sound of the chains)
Don't you know that you're with me
Every single day? (that's the sound of the chains)

Don't you make me feel guilty
Insufferable pain (that's the sound of the chains)
Don't you make me feel guilty
I'll love you the same (that's the sound of the chains)

Don't you make me feel guilty
Insufferable pain (that's the sound of the chains)
Don't you know that you're with me
Every single day? (that's the sound of the chains)
