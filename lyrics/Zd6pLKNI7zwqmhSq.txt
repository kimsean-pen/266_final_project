My heart burns for love
My soul burns for blood
I'll take you, I'll break you
I'll crush you, I'll break you

If you want me, I'll need you
I'll kill you, feed from you
I'll take you down that road
That leads to destruction

Come and take a walk with me
Where the angels fear to tread
Kiss the flame, feel the pain
In the furnace of our love

I can't feed my hunger
Your youth makes me younger
I'll hurt you, desert you
Turn your dreams to nightmares

I'll cheat you, I'll eat you
I'll maim you, I'll drain you
Come to me, come to me
To the dark side where love sleeps

Come and take a walk with me
Where the angels fear to tread
Kiss the flame, feel the pain
In the furnace of our love

Come along and talk with me
Sing the sweet song of despair
Give your body, give your soul
In the furnace of our love

I'll hurt you, you'll love me
I'll scratch you, I'll cut you
You'll kiss me, then miss me
I'll laugh at your torment

I'll have you, and own you
Be hard and cold to you
I'll be your dark angel
I'll be your worst nightmare

Come and take a walk with me
Where the angels fear to tread
Kiss the flame, feel the pain
In the furnace of our love

Come along and talk with me
Sing the sweet song of despair
Give your body, give your soul
In the furnace of our love

(I need you, I'll scold you
I'll touch you, I'll hold you
I'll take you, I'll bite you
I'll calm you, excite you
I'll love you, I need you
I'll kiss you, I'll kill you
I'll beat you, I'll eat you
I'll crush you, I'll thrill you
I'll scratch you, attack you
Destroy you, devour you
I'll hold you, I'll hurt you
I'll maim you, I'll drain you
Come to me, come to me,
come to me, come to me.
I'll have you, I'll own you
I'll tempt you, I'll drop you
I'll hit you, I'll kick you
I'll take you, forsake you
Deny you, defy you
Condemn you, desert you
I'll cut you, I'll scratch you
I'll harm, disarm you
I need you.)
