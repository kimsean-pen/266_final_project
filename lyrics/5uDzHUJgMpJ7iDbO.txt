We spotted the ocean
At the head of the trail
Where are we going
So far away

And somebody told me
This is the place
Where every thing's better
And every thing's safe

Walk on the ocean
Step on the stones
Flesh becomes water
Wood becomes bone

And half an hour later
We packed up our things
We said we'd send letters
And all those little things

They knew we were lying
They smiled just the same
And it seemed they'd already
Forgotten we'd came

Walk on the ocean
Step on the stones
Flesh becomes water
Wood becomes bone

Walk on the ocean
Step on the stones
Flesh becomes water
Wood becomes bone

Back at the homestead
Where the air makes you choke
People don't know you
And trust is a joke
Don't even have pictures
Just memories to hold
Grow sweeter each season
As we slowly grow old
