Symbols of the sun
Symbols of the snow
For those who go beyond
For those who go below

The fatal fall
All fossilized
For love has gone
I'd realized
But, what could replace
And utilize
The hunt for time
I'd idolized

Symbols of the sun
Symbols of the snow
For those who go beyond
For those who go below

If blood is another
Colour of hope
Then what is love
What is love?
If blood is another
Colour of hope
Then what is love
What is love?

Symbols of the sun
Symbols of the snow
For those who go beyond
For those who go below

In this swamp of reverie
The book of thorns
And destiny
If only I could truly be
Then surely I would
Clearly see

Symbols of the sun
Symbols of the snow
For those who go beyond
For those who go below

Like lambs to the slaughter
They die on their feet
A blood feast for a sage
Was the death-day
For their age

Symbols of the sun
Symbols of the snow
For those who go beyond
For those who go below
Like lambs to the slaughter
We die on our feet
A blood feast for a sage
Was the death-day
For our age
Symbols of the sun
Symbols of the snow
For those who go beyond
For those who go below
