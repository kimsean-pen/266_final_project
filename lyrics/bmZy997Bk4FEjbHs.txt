These children will never see their homes
Abandoned and left for dead
No chance to live or watch themselves
Never to find
By watching this room as they took my life

You always promised that this would be the last time
You gave yourself away
I stared, wondering
If you took a life or if its just the sleep you once craved

I know it's hard to forgive yourself
But there is life beyond the pain

I've been dreaming of your face again
Another nightmare, will they ever end?
I've been dreaming of the place you're in
So far away, so far away from me

Regret
I will devour you
But I will live for you

For all these years I've been watching you hurt
And I want to see this end
This is no way to live
You won't forget, but I'll forgive

You won't create again
Don't let the sins of your past become a trap
You will fail again
The words that they tell you
Will come to an end

Time won't heal these wounds
But living with purpose won't make you feel alone
Pain won't bleed out the sorrow
But living today will help you heal tomorrow

I've been dreaming of your face again
Another nightmare, will they ever end?
I've been dreaming of the place you're in
So far away, so far away from me

So far away from me, far away from me
I've been dreaming of your face again
So far away from me, far away from me

I've been dreaming of your face again
(So far away from me, far away from me)
Another nightmare, that will never end
I've been dreaming of the place you're in
(So far away from me, far away from me)
