What makes you feel
And why you gotta be
Like you got the right
To look her up and down
What makes this world
So sick and evil
I know you don't know

What makes you feel
Like you got miracle whip appeal
Who made you the judge an jury
Ain't you never heard of privacy
What makes this world
So sick and evil
You figure it out
