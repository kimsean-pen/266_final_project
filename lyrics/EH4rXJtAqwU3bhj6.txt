Now the future's staring at me
like a vision from the past,
and I know these crumbs they sold me,
they're never gonna last.
Though we know the culture war,
we don't know what it's for but
we've lived the southern strategy.
You know it's never gonna last,
so keep it in the past.

These are different times that we're living in.
These are different times.
Now the kids are growing up so fast.
Paying for our crimes.

You left while I was sleepin'.
You said, "It's down to me".
Oh I've read a little Bible.
You see what you want to see.
Oh, we know the culture war,
we don't know what it's for but
we've lived your southern strategy.
You know it's never gonna last
so keep that shit in the past.

These are different times that we're living in.
'Cause these are different times.
Now the kids are growing up so fast.
They're paying for our crimes.

The dominos they never fell
but bodies they still burn.
Throw my hand into the fire
but still I never learn,
will I ever learn?

That these are different times.
Now the kids are growing up so fast
and paying for our crimes.
We'll be soldiers for you, mommy and daddy,
in your culture war.
We'll be soldiers for you, mommy and daddy,
but we don't know what it's for.

We're soldiers now in the culture war.
We're soldiers now, but we don't know what it's for.
We're soldiers now in the culture war.
We're soldiers now, but we don't know what it's for.
So tell me what's it for.

You want it? You got it, here's your culture war.
You want it? Now you've got it, so tell me what's it for.
