Last night I dreamt that they dropped a bomb
Oh the sea ran dry and the winds had calmed
Skyscrapers fell, they all turned to dust,
Their skeletons of steel were covered in rust

And everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared
Oh everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared

Colours were drained straight from the sky
And nothing living had survived
The mountains were merely removed from the earth
Silver and gold had lost all its worth

And everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared
Oh everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared

I woke from the dream in a cold, cold sweat
I was full of doubt and deep regret,
Suddenly it was so clear to me;
There was nothing left in which to believe

And everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared
Oh everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared
