You live because I gave you life
When I fed your drink
You spear me with your knife
And drain the well eternal
Unworthy parasite
Life is raw this way
But Hell on Earth is real
You'll drown in your own shit

Diadem, shining with your teeth
Vivid on my throne
I drink from your bones
You choked
The ashes of your life
Asphyxiated Judas
Fucking worthless vermin
Traitor crucifixion

Crucified the traitor and his whore!

Judas Pariah
Scum - Judas Pariah
Judas Pariah
Scum - Judas Pariah

Integrity is not for play
You think this is the game
To steal what I create

Judas, vermin, Pariah, scum
Judas, vermin, Pariah, scum
Judas, vermin, Pariah, scum
Judas, vermin, Pariah, scum
Judas, vermin, Pariah, scum
Judas, vermin, Pariah, scum
Judas, vermin, Pariah, scum
Judas, vermin, Pariah...
