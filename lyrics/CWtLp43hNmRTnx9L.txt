C'mon c'mon c'mon - we're gonna make it home tonight
C'mon c'mon c'mon - everything's gonna be alright

The nite is alive - the world is asleep
Dreaming of promises they can't keep
We gotta be tough we gotta be strong
It's only love we've been waiting

So c'mon c'mon c'mon - we're gonna make it home tonight
C'mon c'mon c'mon - everything's gonna be alright

It's only a dream - it's all in your head
It's only some words somebody said
We can believe what we wanna believe
And you can believe in me
