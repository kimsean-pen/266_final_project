faced with shame,
i accept a will that that's long departed
phased with games,
i resent a world i once regarded
but now it seems the changes must be made...

celebrate! terrify me
don't mystify your love

celebrate! terrify me
don't mystify your love

laced with shame,
i reject a thrill that's so misguided
faith in flames,
i'm exempt to blame that's so demanded

but now it seems that changes have been made...

celebrate! terrify me
don't mystify your love

celebrate! terrify me
don't mystify your love

a simple lie brings you down, in an ordinary way
a simple lie brings you down, in an ordinary way
a simple lie...
