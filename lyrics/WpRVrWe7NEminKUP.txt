Just take it away
Just take it away
This is the last time
I will listen to your words of lies
When all your words are fading
You realize that now it's too late
There's nothing left to you now,
that you can lose
隠された世界に真実はないと知って
全て抑え込んだ
今までは... Falling away
心に傷をつけて
This is my last call
This is my last call
何もかも意味なんかなくなって
This is my last call
This is my last call
あてもなくこの手を伸ばすから
I keep trying to feel you with my broken pieces
Tell me, when I was out there,
how did you feel?
立ち止まる時間で失くさぬ様に
ずっと残り続けてた
一人でも... Fighting alone
誰にも気付かれずに繋がる二つの面影
抱えながら
Just take it away
Just take it away
何処までも言葉を合わせて
Just take it away
Just take it away
此処からは離れていけるから
We should have never ever met
It was way better how it was back then
Did I somehow change?
Did you somehow change?
I might just kill you now
'Cause I don't like you
'Cause I don't need you
What ever is there behind your words now
'Cause I don't see you
'Cause I don't feel you
No time to waste on you
This game is over now
This game is over now
I'm not with you
最後 思い出した
小さい永遠を終わらせて
必ず消えるから
This is my last call
This is my last call
何もかも意味なんかなくなったって
This is my last call
This is my last call
あてもなくこの手を伸ばすから
