'Cause I had the best of the worst sides
And I had these lungs, ohh
And I had too many flash fires
That I just let them burn

'Til my chest is on fire
And my head just won't die
I guess I'm lying 'cause I want her
I guess I'm lying 'cause I don't
'Cause I just feel so tired
Like it's move or slowly die
Said, "You ain't you, when you're like this"
"This ain't you and you know it"
But ain't that just the point?

And you don't know how to let go
Who said this must be all or nothing?
But I'm, still caught below
And I'll never let you know
No, I can't tell you nothing

'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
But still, I could always be
Whatever you wanted, but not what you needed
Especially when you been needing me
'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
And I'll say what I don't mean
Just 'cause I wanted, or maybe I need it
Swear, lying's the only rush I need, yeah

'Cause all I needed was some words to say
That all these feelings don't mean shit to me, yeah
'Cause it's all just chemicals anyway
Anyway, yeah

And I got way too many routes to take
To make this all just go away and find another heart to break
So heartless with these words I say
Just saying what I'm supposed to say
'Cause I had nothing for you
I can't love when I can't even love myself
Things I would rather be, thoughts in the back of my head
But I'm addicted to hurting
And I got these lungs, yeah
And I spent too many late nights
Just thinkin' a hole in earth

'Til the sky is on fire
And my head still won't die
I guess I'm lying 'cause I want her
I guess I'm lying 'cause I don't
'Cause I just feel so tired
Like I need something to come alive
She said "You ain't you when you're like this"
"This ain't you, what've you done?"
And I said, that's the point

And you don't know
How to let go
Who said this must be all or nothing?
But I'm still caught below
And I'll never let you know
No, I can't tell you nothing

'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
But still, I could always be
Whatever you wanted, but not what you needed
Especially when you've been needing me

'Cause I'm a fucking mess inside
And I'll say what I don't mean
Just 'cause I wanted, or maybe I need it
Swear, lying's the only rush I need, yeah
