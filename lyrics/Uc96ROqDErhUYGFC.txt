Bumbaclat pussy, unno fi dead
They want me dead
They want me dead
Put that price on my head

No, no, no! They want me dead or alive
They want me dead or alive, I'm just tryin' to survive
You niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
Put that shit on my life
They want me dead or alive
They want me dead or alive
I'm just tryin' to survive
You niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
Put that shit on my life

This is the shit I've been talkin' 'bout
This is the shit that been said
Niggas ain't chasin' they dreams
They've just been after my head
All of my demons keep tellin' me
"Don't you react, this'll get you a felony"
Work on your balance and I'm talkin' chemically
Call up my shooter and aim at your melony
I do not swim in no pool full of jealousy
Take out the sheriff, then body the deputy
Sick to my stomach, my money the remedy
I am the legend, don't fuck up my legacy
Private numbers keep calling my phone
Hello? Is Jazz there?

No, no, no! They want me dead or alive
They want me dead or alive, I'm just tryin' to survive
You niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
Put that shit on my life
They want me dead or alive
They want me dead or alive
I'm just tryin' to survive
You niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
Put that shit on my life

Give me a reason to snap
I put this scene on the map
I know the niggas who been talkin' down
But whenever they see me, the first ones to dap
Look at my record, nigga (flawless!)
I can't respect you niggas
I am the golden child, they gettin' older now
It would make sense why you boys get no recognition
They want me dead or alive
Someone tell mom I won't see 25
Mean, I can tell her
But I just do not want to be there to witness the tears in her eyes
'Cuzzi been back on the road
'Cuzzi still stuck in the cold
I've been second guessing
Like there's someone better than me in my city? (Wait)

No, no, no! They want me dead or alive
They want me dead or alive, I'm just tryin' to survive
You niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
Put that shit on my life
They want me dead or alive
They want me dead or alive
I'm just tryin' to survive
You niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
Put that shit on my life

Niggas look like virgins
Washed up on the tide, that's detergent
Hm, I feel like Ja' back in '99
Niggas see me scream, "Murder"
I walk around and scream, "Murder"
Nowadays, everybody getting murdered
The judge asked for the verdict
Then he looked at the jury

No, no, no! They want me dead or alive
They want me dead or alive, I'm just tryin' to survive
You niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
Put that shit on my life
They want me dead or alive
They want me dead or alive
I'm just tryin' to survive
You niggas fallin' behind, you never crossin' my mind
Put that shit on my life
