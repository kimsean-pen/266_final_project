I flex like David Icke

I flex like David Icke, man
I think I know the truth, man
These UFOs are real
And these documents are proof, man

Aliens are here, man
The aliens are here, man
The reptilians are here, man
The Illuminati's listenin'
Hitler never died
The Holocaust's a lie
Six million Jews?
Show me the proof
The moon landing's fake
They never went to space
Our president's a clone
He always gets replaced
When he fuck up
The Jews are reptilians
Bonding Israel to kill the Palestinians
Man, when you wake up
I hope you know the truth, man
'Cause David Icke was right
'Cause David Icke was right
Flex like David Icke
I think I'm David Icke, man
I flex like David Icke
I think I'm David Icke, man
I know I'm David Icke
'Cause I know the truth
And he knows the truth
