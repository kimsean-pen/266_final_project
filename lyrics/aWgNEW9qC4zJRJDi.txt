Beneath, between, within, beyond – Nothing
No more truths to reveal
No revelations to proclaim
No men to bestow them upon
And only ashes remains
When nothing survives to feed the fire
And the fire begins to feed itself
Self proclaimed divinity
Delusion of grandeur
Self inflicted lunacy
Driven by the urge to become
More than one can be
More than one can aspire to be
Only ashes remain
When nothing survives to feed the fire
Only ashes remain
And embers wane
On a pile of dust
Beware, the ones who play with fire
It shall burn to the ground
Everything you claim to know
Everything you hold dear
Leaving you naked and weak
Fragile as newborn child
Across the barren lands of decrepit mind
Serpent's crawling through the cracks
Through the dirt and dried blood
Through the fractured spine
Nodes of power shattered
Man's sanctity, all dignity
The lunacy of man – defiled
Eternally astray, wandering with folded eyes
Across the wasteland they've become
In search for paradise
They will never find a way
They will never become
What they yearn to be
All sanctity, all dignity
The lunacy of man – defiled
Across the barren lands of decrepit mind
Serpent's crawling through the cracks
In the darkest of our thoughts
Through the fractured spine
It travels on and on
Beneath, between, within, beyond
Through the nodes of power
Beyond our reach
Through the broken conscious
To entwine
To feed the blaze, to feed itself
To feed the blaze
Until only ashes remain
Come and play with fire
And burn to the ground
Everything you thnk you know
Everything you hold close to your heart
Where it hurts the most
