Hey, tell me what you want me to say
You know I'm stupid for you
Hey, can you come and come out and play
You know I'm stupid for you

I'm colour coding my moods
You're yellow, I'm natural blue
Let's get together and be green like my insides
At least I'll match your eyes
Jealous and hypnotized
Let's match our faces and be equally in love

Hey, tell me what you want me to say
You know I'm stupid for you
Hey, can you come and come out and play
You know I'm stupid for you

Let's trash our whole afternoon
Reciting recycled news
Until we meld and go back to your hotel room
I'll be your new favourite tune
I'll be your black cloud by june
But only when you miss the rain like I miss you

Just double dare me
And I promise now that I'll stay
It's not like you're married but I still got carried away

Hey, tell me what you want me to say
You know I'm stupid for you
Hey, can you come and come out and play
You know I'm stupid for you

You're playin' ring round my head
I'll wear you like a halo
You're a symphony, I'm just a sour note
I'll take what I can get
The best is hard to grip when everybody wants you
And everybody wants you

You're playin' ring round my head
I'll wear you like a halo
You're a symphony, I'm just a sour note
I'll take what I can get
The best is hard to grip when everybody wants you

Hey, tell me that you want me to stay
You know I'm stupid for you
Hey, can you come and come out and play
You know I'm stupid for you
You're playin' ring round my head
I'll wear you like a halo
You're a symphony, I'm just a sour note
I'll take what I can get
The best is hard to grip when everybody wants you
And everybody wants you
