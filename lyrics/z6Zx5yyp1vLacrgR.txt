All Pigs Must Die
This ain't August '69
All Pigs Must Die
7 and 7 - Sieg Heil - Sublime!
Their trotters are in the mud
They're better off with the Son of God
They had no idea
Not even close, not even near
All Pigs Must Die
This ain't August '69
All Pigs Must Die
7 and 7 - Sieg Heil - Sublime!

All Pigs Must Die
This is August '99 (That was August '99)
All Pigs Must Die
Their stolen riches are really mine
Cover their faces in blood
They're better off with the Son of God
All Pigs Must Die
This is August '99
The Law of The Claw will make them mine
