I don't know why, but it feels like
I will, I will be there
Turning the lights off, I'm dreaming
Feeling, I will be there
Open the window, I'm breathing
Seeing, crimson sunsets
Turning the lights on, still dreaming
Feeling, I will be there

I'll be there
Feeling, I will be there
I'll be there
Dreaming, I will be there

I'll be there
Feeling, I will be there
I'll be there
Dreaming, I will be there

I don't know when, but I'll find you
Somewhere, on the horizon
Chasing the light to where you are
It's all right, I will be there
Closing your eyes, now you're breathing,
Feeling, the sun in your touch
Holding me close, we're still dreaming
Feeling, we will be there

I'll be there
Feeling, I will be there
I'll be there
Dreaming, I will be there

I'll be there
Feeling, I will be there
I'll be there
Dreaming, I will be there
