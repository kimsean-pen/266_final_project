I'm staring at the clock
I'm wondering why I'm still here
And my head's about to pop
I'm thinking that you best stay clear

Oh, how did I get stuck in this predicament, I don't know
I want to throw this repetition out the window
I'm gettin' tired, of wondering why I'm still here

And I wish that I could
Snap my fingers, make myself disappear
Snap my fingers, get myself out of here
Snap my fingers, snap my fingers Oh, oh

'Cause I'd rather be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
I'd rather be, anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
Could be catching a wave
I could be seeing the world
I could be riding with the top down, kissing my girl
I could be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

The sun is coming up, don't want to get out of bed
Well here we go again, I'm back to where I began
Oh, you can take my checkbook
Credit cards and keep 'em
I'd give 'em up for just a little bit of freedom
And my escape, I'm planning it in my head

And I wish that I could
Snap my fingers, make myself disappear
Snap my fingers, get myself out of here
Snap my fingers, snap my fingers. Oh, oh

'Cause I'd rather be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
I'd rather be, anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
I could be sippin' a drink
I could be gettin' a tan
I could be hanging on the beach
With my toes in the sand
I could be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

No more but stop, sittin' in traffic
Wakin' up at 6 in the morning, ain't gonna happen
No more office, long long lineups
You can just forget about it, we want freedom
We want, we want, we want
We want freedom
We want, we want, we want

And I'd rather be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
I'd rather be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
I'd rather be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
I'd rather be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

I could be catching a wave
I could be seeing the world
I could be riding with the top down, kissing my girl

I could be sleeping in
I could be living it up
I could be sitting at home not giving a fuck

Could be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here.
I'd rather be anywhere else, anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
Anywhere else but here
Anywhere else but here
