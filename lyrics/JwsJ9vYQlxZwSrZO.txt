Deafening thoughts, that my World has ended
Lying here with no desire to move
Fade away from this lonely place
To summertime Dreams
From the dark into Golden Heavens
I ascend
Silent, the house, with thoughts I can't erase
Dead Tree violently sways outside
Fade away from this lonely place
To summertime Dreams
From the dark into Golden Heavens
I ascend
I fade away from this lonely place
To summertime Dreams
I ascend
