The colder the night gets
The further she strays
And he doesn't like it
Being this way

And she tried so hard
To steer away
From the meeting place
But her heart had led her there

She clings to his consciousness
Wherever he lays
He struggles to sleep at night
And during the day

He's worried she's waiting in his dreams
To drag him back to the meeting place
His love had left him there
Where the voices still echoes

"I'm sorry I met you, darling.
I'm sorry I met you."
As she turned into the night
All he had was the words
"I'm sorry I met you, darling.
I'm sorry I've left you."

For weeks they had strolled around
Playing the fools
They knew the time would come
And time would be cruel

Because it is cruel to everyone
He's crying out from the meeting place
He stranded himself there
Where the voice still echoes

"I'm sorry I met you, darling.
I'm sorry I met you."
As she turned into the night
All he had was the words
"I'm sorry I met you, darling.
I'm sorry I've left you."
"I'm sorry I met you, darling.
I'm sorry I've left you."
