Study the velvet light
In your room
Trace the years that fell upon our heads
Gone confused
In time you find a friend that you know
Won't know you
For time is like a banging drum
Set to solitude

Stay awake
You're far from view
Now you're floating on nowhere
Can't turn away from all the pain of the world
It wont go for you

Stay awake
You're far from view
Are you feeling it coming?
Can't run away from all the pain of the world
That wont comfort you

The sun is to color the sky
Simple hues
Feather light that dissipates unites
Around you
The planets are aligned in your palm
With nothing to do
But spin around the heavens saying
There is no hope for you

Stay awake
You're far from view
Now you're floating on nowhere
Can't turn away from all the pain of the world
It wont go for you
