The night is mine, it burns so black
And there will be no morning light
The human race's foul disease
Will keep the morning from our sight

Why can't we say the secret word?
Respect for nothing, fire or flood
Expect no quarter, no reprieve
We writhe and grin in our own blood

No sun, just clouds and poison rain
Raped and freezing, victims of the dream again

Truly our days are darker now
We lie and cheat to our own selves
If we do this, I ask you how
Can we speak truth to someone else

There is no way, no road at all
We are destroyed by our own plan
The air we breathe will kill us all
And no-one left to give a damn

No sun, just clouds and poison rain
Raped and freezing, victims of the dream again

Stay clean, be true
Do whatever you can do
Make it soon or we all die
Ten thousand years and all we got is suicide

If there be gods, then tell me why
They make us kill and kill again
One hundred thousand, thousand years
No mercy in the minds of men

What is the word that we should read?
What incantation should we say?
How can we ask for justice now
When all the world is blown away?

No sun, no hope, the world is run insane
Raped and freezing, victims of the dream again

Stay clean, be true
Do whatever you can do
Make it soon or we all die
Ten thousand years and all we got is suicide
