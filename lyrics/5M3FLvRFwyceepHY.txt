Waking up on the floor with no one else in the room
Never felt like this before
I'm just hoping I leave soon
And if tomorrow I don't wake up, just know I really tried
To make the best of your forgiveness

Tell me one last time how I never tried

Was so close to breaking through last time
Thought that I'd be sheltered by nothingness
By the lack of consciousness
But I lay here awake, too afraid to dream
'Cause I might have to face myself
I'll buckle at my knees

Tell me one last time how I never tried

I've seen the light, but never felt this close
Pushed my pain aside, 'cause I could never give it to those

'Cause I never see the point in sharing defeat
Displaying my debts to the world
I just live in repeat
Vacant and desperate

Tell me one last time how I never tried

And if tomorrow I don't wake up
Just know I really tried to make the best of your forgiveness
And tell my brother he'll be fine
