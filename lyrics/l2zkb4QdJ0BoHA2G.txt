Far down the road there's a war going on
No where to hide, left all behind
Leading the battle, the fights in your face
War is rising!

The end's getting near and the price is to high
Death will be coming and don't ask me why
Covered in dust you're six feet below
Soon its forgotten and they're back for more

There's no secret, still no one knows if it's all gone
Can't you see now, you're all alone, feel the

Fear - breaking the line
Feel the fear, you must die alone – tonight

Now I look back through the years passing by
What did we gain, but sorrow and pain
We are living our lives in denial
War is rising!

No one will win and we're losing the time
Humans will vanish and earth will be fine
A new dawn will rise and tales will be told
Soon it's forgotten and history's old

Feel the fear - breaking the line
Feel the fear - and we're losing the time
Feel the fear – a new dawn will rise and tales will be told
Feel the fear | Feel the fear
