Sit down beside me, and stay awhile
Let our hearts do the parse
With wide and burns to meet the house?
So the day never starts
Cause thats what I want
Thats what we need
Cause thats who we are
Cause thats what we need

Aaaahhhhh lalalalaa aaahhhh lalalalaa

Sit down beside me and stay awhile
There are shadows
til we all ingrate?
til we got nothing, left to say
Cause thats what we are
Thats what we need
cause thats who we are
Thats what we need

Aaaahhhhh lalalalaa Thats what we need
cause thats who we are
aaahhhh lalalalaa thats what we need
aaahhh lalalala

*Musical*

How long love?
And stay awhile

Sit down beside me, and stay awhile
Til the near ends arrive
til the morning rises as we part our ways?
to the end of our days
