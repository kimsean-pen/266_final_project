No measured mark of wit, wisdom or rhetoric could solve this

Too fractured to endear, bonds broken beyond view

With all roads leading here, fettered by an endless blue

But I held the arrows, I pulled the strings
And bottled messages never to be seen
But I held the arrows, I pulled the strings

In fits and starts it can blossom and bloom
But I held the arrows, I pulled the strings

In fits and starts it can blossom and bloom
The shot at the moon still falls short of the stars
