Cross-legged, sitting in your mum's kitchen
My word's missing, and I like the way you sing
And I like the way you think 'bout the weather forecast
'Cause this summer won't last
Ripped photographs, whisper secrets to the wind
This is a battle I won't win

You'll go and I'll know
I owe you all the love you showed me I deserved
The gold that I was worth
You build me up like architecture
Boy, you'll break my heart, I'll let ya
'Cause no one nowhere knows me better than you

Your bags are packed, my words are stacked
Towers of paperbacks with all that I won't say
The dreams we used to make
Now your train ticket takes my breath with it
But you're the biggest and the brightest
That this place has ever made
And I can't ask you stay

You'll go and I'll know
I owe you all the love you showed me I deserved
The gold that I was worth
You built me up like architecture
Boy, you'll break my heart, I'll let ya
'Cause no one nowhere knows me better than you

You were borrowed, now I'm blue
Oh, nobody new could be better than you

You'll go and I'll know
That I owe you all the love you showed me I deserved
The gold that I was worth, oh
You'll go and I'll know
I owe you all the love you showed me I deserved
The gold that I was worth

You built me up like architecture
Boy, you'll break my heart, I'll let ya
'Cause no one nowhere knows me better than you
