Who can lie for the statue?
No retake
Who can lie, for the worst is over?
Carry your legacy
When the words become you
When the story builds you
Then who will find you there?

Who will find you
When all you are, all you are is dust?
Who will find you
For centuries?

Who will find you
When all you are, all you are is dust?
Who will find you
For centuries?

When the words become you
When all you've ever said
Is it all that, all that you've been dreaming, dreaming?
Is it all that, all that you've been hoping, hoping for?

Who will find you
When all you are, all you are is dust?
Who will find you
For centuries?

Who will find you
When all you are, all you are is dust?
Who will find you
For centuries?
