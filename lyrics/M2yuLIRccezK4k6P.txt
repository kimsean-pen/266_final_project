You ain't the first to realize
You ain't the first to look in my eyes
Over my head and positive
I have a gift that i'll never give
You ain't the first, you ain't the first
You ain't the first, you ain't the first
Last time i walked down this street
Down this street
I wanted to die
Die
Now i'm fighting
Feel like i'm fighting
Feel like i'm fighting for my life
Life
I walked down this street
Down this street
I wanted to die
Die
Now i'm fighting
Feel like i'm fighting
Feel like i'm fighting for my life
Last time i walked down this street
Down this street
I wanted to die
Die
Now i'm fighting
Feel like i'm fighting
Feel like i'm fighting for my life
Life
I walked down this street
Down this street
I wanted to die
Die
Now i'm fighting
Feel like i'm fighting
Feel like i'm fighting for my life
You ain't the first to realize
You ain't the first to look in my eyes
Over my head and positive
I have a gift that i'll never give
