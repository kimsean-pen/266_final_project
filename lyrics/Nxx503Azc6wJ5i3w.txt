Well she long'd for another town
Said she "burned too hot to settle down"
Between the bars she'd make amends
But she cried for a love that was sure to end

I cant remember all her lies (Think about it)
I played her game just to feel those eyes
I couldnt even ask her why
As she slipped away off into the night

She was just like my billie jean
She made the world light up for me
But too bright made me blind to see
I still wanna feel her energy

She came to me like a love of mine
I blew her safe then she blew my mind
But now my heart has been turned to stone
I wish i found a better way
I'm telling everybody lies (how can it be)
She kepy jonesing for the final fight
But now im on a higher plane
The open road was all i wanted when you gave me away

She was just like my billie jean
She made the world light up for me
But too bright made me blind to see
I still wanna feel her energy

Just like my billie jean
She made the world light up for me
But too bright made me blind to see
I still wanna feel her energy

Make the city light up for me
Show me what you see
Just make the city light up for me
Just like my billie jean
Just like my billie jean
Just like my billie jean
She lit the world right up for me

She was just like my billie jean
She made the world light up for me
But too bright made me blind to see
I still wanna feel her energy (billie jean)
Just like my billie jean
Just like my billie jean
Just like my billie jean
I still wanna feel her energy
