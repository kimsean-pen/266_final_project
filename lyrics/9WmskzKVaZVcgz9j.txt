Pacific sun,
You should have warned us it gets so cold here
And the night can freeze before you set a fire
And our flares go unnoticed, diminished
Faded just as soon as they are fired.

We are, we are, intriqued
We are, we are, invisible

Oh how we shouted, how we screamed
Take notice, take interest, take me with you
When all our fears fall on deaf ears tonight
They're burning the roads they built to lead us to the light
And blinding our hearts with their shining lies

We're closing our caskets, cold and tight
But I'm dying to live...

Pacific sun,
You should have warned us these heights are dizzying
And the climb can kill you long before the fall
And our trails go unmarked and unmapped, and
Covered just as soon as they are crossed.

We are, we are, intriquing
We are, we are, desirable

Oh how we shouted, how we screamed
Take notice, take interest, take me with you
When all our fears fall on deaf ears tonight
They're burning the roads they built to lead us to the light
And blinding our hearts with their shining lies

Oh how we shouted, how we screamed
Take notice, take interest, take me with you
When all our fears fall on deaf ears tonight
They're burning the roads they built to lead us to the light
And blinding our hearts with their shining lies...
(fades out)
