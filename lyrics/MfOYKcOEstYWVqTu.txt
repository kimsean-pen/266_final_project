I got no reason to lie to you
What's in the cards, that's what I do
I was born running and laughing out loud
With my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds

You better run
Baby, you better run
I got a blade like lightning
Silver bullets in my gun

I'm short and I'm tall, I'm black and I'm white
Sometimes I'd be wrong, sometimes I'd be right
I'm iron and steel and I'm bad to the bone
You come looking for trouble, honey, don't you come alone

You better run
Baby, you better run
I got a blade like lightning
Silver bullets in my gun

I've seen them come and I've seen them go
I've seen things and been people that nobody knows
I'm talking in pictures and I'm painting them black
I've seen Satan coming, honey, in a big black Cadillac

You better run
Baby, you better run, oh yeah
I got a blade like lightning
Silver bullets in my gun

Watch out!
