If you're gonna let me go, I need to know, need to know
If you're gonna let me go, I need to know, need to know

You're desperate for affection, sacred love, fabled love
But no response to come, that's a lesson learned, lesson learned

Look into my baby's eyes
You turn it around, you turn it around
You turn it around so desperately
You turn it around, you turn it around

It echoes down that road that builds you up, builds you up
You walk for miles and miles, not sensible, logical

So turn it around, so turn it around
You turn it around so desperately
You turn it around, you turn it around
You turn it around, you turn it around
You turn it around so desperately
You turn it around, you turn it around
You turn it around, you turn it around
You turn it around so desperately
So desperately, so desperately, so desperately, oh
