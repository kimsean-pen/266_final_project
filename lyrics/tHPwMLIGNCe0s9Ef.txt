Stand, stand to attention
The moment's passed you by
Now it's the rest of your life
Dare, dare I to mention
Your laughter makes me cry
A speck of dust in my eye
And I am unafraid and blissful
Here I come
I am unashamed at getting nothing done
I am a cavalcade that tumbles one by one
But I'm okay, just like Jesus' Son

Bone, bone of contention
I've lost the count of times
I've seen you fkin' goodbye
So good, orderly directions
To pull you from the mire
Your universe on fire
And I am unafraid and blissful
Here I come
I am unashamed at getting nothing done
I am a cavalcade that tumbles one by one
But I'm okay, just like Jesus' Son

And I am unafraid and blissful
Here I come
I am unashamed at getting nothing done
I am a cavalcade that tumbles one by one
But I'm okay, just like Jesus' Son
But I'm okay, just like Jesus' Son
I'm okay, just like Jesus' Son
I'm okay, just like Jesus' Son
