Tokyo
reflections in your eyes
we both smile and move in closer
while the sun dries your hair

morning shows in the hotel tv
here's your clothes
we leave the card key
maybe one day
maybe one day

i go, but still
tireless times unite us
i realize this morning
soaked in city rain
just what we leave behind us
again
again

Z! eyedrops
the one bestseller
raindrops on your clear umbrella
walking through the streets of Shinjuku

in airport line
while shoes are drying
smoking hope and killing time
i never fully thought out what to say
but maybe one day
maybe one day

i go, but still
tireless times unite us
i realize this morning
soaked in city rain
just what we leave behind us
but time will reunite us
again
again.
