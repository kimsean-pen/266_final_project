Toss and turn all night
don't know how to make it right
crippling anxiety

This crowd was growing old
If I may be so bold
Will you go straight with me?

I don't wanna die
lonely and uptight
Stay with me
All will be revealed

I remember when
this all felt like pretend
and I still can't believe

sprung you from your hole
with everything you own
as if you weren't already free

I don't wanna die
lonely and uptight
stay with me
all will be revealed

I don't wanna die
lonely and uptight
stay with me
all will be revealed
