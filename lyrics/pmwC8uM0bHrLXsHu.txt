You are holding her so tight
Finally she's yours
The summer's giving you more
And everyhting's allright
Now you're fool ... meaning
What... adventuries
You're gonna tell your best friends
You're gonna wake up singing
The summer is magic, is magic oh oh oh
The summer is magic
You have to imagine, imagine oh oh oh
The summer is magic
In the disco i was after,
She pull her hands no speech
She give a winter finally,
And burn and still to laughter
She is dancing with the d.j.,
She's so insovering
In summer do you think
Ain't it a lovely day
The summer is magic, is magic oh oh oh
The summer is magic
You have to imagine, imagine oh oh oh
The summer is magic
The summer is magic, is magic oh oh oh
The summer is magic
You have to imagine, imagine oh oh oh
The summer is magic
(...)
Oh-oh-oh, oh oh oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh oh oh
The summer is magic, is magic oh oh oh
The summer is magic
You have to imagine, imagine oh oh oh
The summer is magic
The summer is magic, is magic oh oh oh
The summer is magic
You have to imagine, imagine oh oh oh
The summer is magic
The summer is magic, is magic oh oh oh
The summer is magic
You have to imagine, imagine oh oh oh
The summer is magic
The summer is magic, is magic oh oh oh
The summer is magic
You have to imagine, imagine oh oh oh
The summer is magic
