With one hand washing the other...

I've conceived and achieved, and I'm bleached and I'm clean
And I eat the spleen fed back to me
And I gleam and succeed in-between white sheets
In a dream where I lie next to me

I could bleed out
Emphysema
Got both feet in a swollen fever
Hear no evil
See no evil
But I can speak
And bleat for you

When you clap, I do it
I can step right to it
When you ask me to move you
When you clap, I do it
But if I stop a minute
You'll ask me to lose

With my sides in a vice, I'm concise and contrived
And my imperfections run to me
And there's flies in a pile, where my hopes go to die
Hear my plier plucked insecurities

You're looking Godly next to me,
Pull and set us free

When you clap, I do it
I can step right to it
When you ask me to move you
When you clap, I do it
But if I stop a minute
You'll ask me to lose

I was born
In love everything
Exhausted empathy
I got bored
Theres a truth in apathy
Isolated entropy
Let's get bored
Let's get born
And feed the sickle down our throats

When you clap, I do it
I can step right to it
When you ask me to move you
And when you clap, I do it
But if I stop a minute
You'll ask me to lose
When you clap, I do it
I can step right to it
When you ask me to move you
And when you clap, I do it
But if I stop a minute
You'll ask me to lose
