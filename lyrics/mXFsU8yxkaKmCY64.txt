Who's got what it takes
To be my guy
What it takes
To make me shine
What it takes
To get me fired up

Who's got what it takes
To be my beau
What it takes
To make me blow
What it takes
To make this beat flow

Everyone talks about what they think they need
They're makin' up a list of things
One, two, three

Everyone is different
But what we can agree
Every girl wants a boy to treat her sweet

Don't think that being mean will get you any where
Don't think that acting cool will me wanna care
I need your respect if you're gonna be the one
And if you must apply, then try to get the job done

Who's got what it takes
To be my guy
What it takes
To make me shine
What it takes
To get me fired up

Who's got what it takes
To be my beau
What it takes
To make me blow
What it takes
To make this beat flow

Talk can be so cheap
So I just look for action
Be good to me
If you want my attraction

(Maybe I just want to much, but I don't really care)

I know I'm worth it
And I know he's out there
Wait, wait, you might be a contender
Hey, hey, can I borrow your sweatshirt
Normally I'm not the one to say hello first
But if I didn't, I might miss out and that might hurt

Who's got what it takes
To be my guy
What it takes
To make me shine
What it takes
To get me fired up

Who's got what it takes
To be my beau
What it takes
To make me blow
What it takes
To make this beat flow

I been contemplating
What it takes to make me
Give my heart

Could you be the one
Standing in the crowd
I'm waiting to find out
(I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, oh)

Who's got what it takes
To be my guy
What it takes
To make me shine
What it takes
To get me fired up

Who's got what it takes
To be my beau
What it takes
To make me blow
What it takes
To make this beat flow

Who's got what it takes
To be my guy
What it takes
To make me shine
What it takes
To get me fired up

Who's got what it takes
To be my beau
What it takes
To make me blow
What it takes
To make this beat flow
