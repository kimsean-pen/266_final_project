Follow the bloodline throughout the past
Seek and you will find a hidden ancestry
At night the circle gathers
When the world is shedding skin
The earth now stands to shatter
The ritual begins
let the ritual begin

A maelstrom of energy
Turns the air electric
Starting a synergy
The patterns all symmetric
Masks are covering their faces
Hiding the alteration
Shapeshifting in phases
Behold illumination

The silence screaming as light turns dark
Altering what's real
Awake they're dreaming
The lucid nightmares opening the gates
A light is gleaming, the blackened rain
Summoned forth this night
By the hybrid cult

Follow the bloodline throughout the past
Seek and you will find a hidden ancestry
At night the circle gathers
When the world is shedding skin
The earth now stands to shatter
Erupting from within

The silence screaming as light turns dark
Altering what's real
Awake they're dreaming
The lucid nightmares opening the gates
A light is gleaming, the blackened rain
Summoned forth this night
By the hybrid cult

Not entirely human
DNA strings anomalous
Blood of god and man
in synergy blasphemous

(Solo)

The silence screaming as light turns dark
Altering what's real
Awake they're dreaming
The lucid nightmares opening the gates
A light is gleaming, the blackened rain
Summoned forth this night
By the hybrid cult
