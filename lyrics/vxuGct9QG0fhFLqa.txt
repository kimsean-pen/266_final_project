There's things that go bang and bump in the night
And over at your house that sounds about right
It sounds about right
You're smiling tonight
There's films on the telly
It's raining outside
Have fun with the sister
Have fun with the boys
Oh, when the wolves eat me
I won't make a noise
I will not make a noise
Hello there yellow girl
I'm trying to break into your world
I'm going to steal all your thoughts
I'm going to sail your yellow boats
Hello there yellow girl
I'm trying to break into your world
I'm going to steal all your thoughts
I'm going to sail your yellow boats
Can someone come quickly
Cos my heart is on fire
You can throw me and catch me
I'm feeling so tired
You have made me so tired
I've tried to be someone
I'm trying to be cool for you
But look where it got me
My lies are all coming true
And am I just your fool?
You hurt yourself now
You silly girl
You hurt yourself now
You silly girl
You hurt yourself now
You silly girl
You hurt yourself now
You silly girl
You hurt yourself now
