School holiday that you could do without
A weekend break we've slept in late
A beach resort under a year of rain
This is where it has to start

When the AC hum inside your sleepy head
Drowns the startup chime inside your heart
Technology is there to cure yourself
This is where it has to start

This is where it has to start
This is where it has to start

Unfamiliar brand falls from an empty shelf
Without sounding an alarm
The test results tell you nothing at all
This is where it has to start

When the AC hum inside your sleepy head
Drowns the startup chime inside your heart
Technology is there to cure yourself
This is where it has to start

This is where it has to start
This is where it has to start

The northern lights are just a band for hire
Playing class reunions without end
The test results tell you nothing at all
Technology is there to cure yourself

A dusty cartridge for the VCS
Is on the way to see old friends
Is on the way to see old friends
Is on the way to see old friends
Is on the way to see old friends
