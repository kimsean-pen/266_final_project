You're always try
to hide in the night
and blink at the door
You'd let it go
though you'll never know
when it all may be gone
we close our heart
we shut down our world
to rumors you know
Tore down the shield
your future reveals
where the feel's yet to go

You've gotta open up your mind and feel love in the light
You've got to open up your heart and feel love in the light
You've gotta open up your mind and feel love in the light
You've got to open up your heart feel love in the light

they won't decide
watch time glassing by
then float away
you cant get ill
just typewrite on in
to the rows we could play
dissatisfied
you always have tried
to divert with goodbyes
though what you seek
who knows it could be
right in front of your eyes
You've gotta open up your mind and feel love in the light
You've got to open up your heart and feel love in the light
You've gotta open up your mind and feel love in the light
You've got to open up your heart and feel love in the light
love in your life

(Repeat to the end)
