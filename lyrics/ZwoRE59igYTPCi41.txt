I know it's cliche
But I'll say it
I wish that you'd stay
One more night

Everyone I talk to
I know, they don't hear me
And everything I do
I've learned, in the movies
So please forgive me
I just need a reason to stay
In the movies
To stay, in the movies

These sleeping pills are destroying me
Maybe I'll just stay awake in the movies

Every time I check the time
Numbers match
And every time I look at you
I pray, we'll last

Everyone I talk to
I know, they don't hear me
And everything I do
I've learned, in the movies
So please forgive me
I just need a reason to stay
In the movies
To stay, in the movies

These sleeping pills are destroying me
Maybe I'll just stay awake in the movies
(To stay in the movies)

When the lights are down
And you're in some evening gown
Your balcony
Stay in the world
Oh, stay in the movies, with me
Stay in the movies
Stay in the movies

It's not the fear of falling, it's fear of letting go
It's not the fear of falling, it's fear of letting go
