The sun bleeds in
Hear the magpies sing for sorrow
It makes things better
Maybe we'll get to spread our wings tomorrow
If luck will let us
Can anyone fly into these grey skies?
Is there somewhere I'm meant to be?

Sea fog comes like a river
Rolls a stone it's rolling me

I missed my turn
In the dark I hear your voice
It makes things easy
I've strayed too far from the road
Wish you could always make things easy
And I won't fight through the rising tide
If that's the way it has to be

Sea fog comes like a river
Rolls a stone it's rolling me
Sea fog comes like a river
Rolls a stone it's rolling me
Sea fog rolling
Sea fog rolling
Sea fog rolling
