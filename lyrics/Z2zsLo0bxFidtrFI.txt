Your voice is a mockingbird

Calling me when the day is gone
You please yourself with every word
Telling me where I'm going wrong
Telling me where I've gone wrong
Get me out it's starting to burn

I can't let go for the life of me
Some hold tight, and some turn
Another fire out in front of me
My whole life out in front of me
You can't kill what's already dead

But I don't blame you for trying it
The sun comes up and falls away
Two little birds makin' sense of it
Two mockingbirds making sense of it
