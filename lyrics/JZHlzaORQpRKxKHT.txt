We are the creeping tendrils of our Father Wolves among
sheep, herding the meek Spreading the reach of his web of deceit
As he wills it, so shall it be
Manifestation of destiny

Malleable flesh- my guise that which I despise An Imposter- lurking
Marionettes- unaware of their strings
Our agenda- triggering tragedy

Veiled in the suit of a soldier, complete with gun in hand
I'll return this child to your precious holy land

With but one life, I pluck upon the heartstrings of man
Tension turns the tide- calculating genocide

Predictable- the sheepish acts of
mortal men Cycles of bloodshed that never end
Instill disorder, a task for we
Soulless servants of the Shadow King

These eyes have witnessed the death of a nation
They have seen the horrors of w*r
These hands have cast innocence to the abyss
I have felt life turn to ash
Alchemic soldiers carrying out
grievous orders Progressing esoteric agenda
I'll expose corruption of the senior staff
To do so, I must go deeper

My only chance at a semblance of
redemption is to root out the evil within

Honorable- though my intentions may be
My actions are treasonous
Behind the scenes- there lurk inhuman
beings Homunculi- the likes of which cannot die

For too long I've been a puppet
Now I see my true ambitions
Incinerate these miasmic fiends
Bring order to a nation

For every life stolen from my fellow man
Flames are on the rise
Cremating evil before my eyes

Homunculus- witch who ensnares the minds of men
This eve your heart shall burn in my hand
Cinder and ash once flesh and cell
Dualis Flamel

Homunculus- witch who ensnares the minds of men
This eve your heart shall burn in my hand
Cinder and ash once flesh and cell
Dualis Flame
