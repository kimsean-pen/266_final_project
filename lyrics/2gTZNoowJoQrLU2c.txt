When the sounds come together so close to my face
It's no wonder we wonder
Let's take a place
Oh I feel like an animal in the night
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Oh, figure eight
We're as big as the ocean
I could hear all of your devotion
I would be more than a small human with her head
Pressed against your mapped emotions
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
(Interlude)
And we will move just like we're in a movie
We will speak so warm and smoothly
We are like the people we came from
We are dancing and advancing to the light
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right, we'll clear it
Make it right
