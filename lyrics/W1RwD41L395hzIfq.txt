Plastic roses line empty altars
See the faces, I'm feeling altered
Confronting the fear that lives on your breath
In dreams he's still here
Message left in the basement

I walk down these endless hallways
Drugs and weekends can't change my days
Leaving the lines you've drawn on your own
All sorts of crimes
Meet me in, in the basement

Step outside my house
It's happening most every day
I held to nothing
I have nothing left to say

Plastic roses line empty altars
See the faces, I'm feeling altered
Confronting the fear that lives in your chest
In dreams he's still here
Message left in the basement
