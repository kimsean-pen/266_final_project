I wanna be better to me
The better I do I let it leave me
Now the way that I see it
Everything begins in your light
Your center
So leave your light on
Leave your light on
Or leave
I wanna be better to you
I wanna do much better
And I wanna read your letters again
I wanna learn you forever
Forever
So leave your light on
Leave your light on
Or leave
Yeah, leave your light on
Leave your light on
Don't leave
