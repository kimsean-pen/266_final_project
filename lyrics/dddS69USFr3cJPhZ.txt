you
left a place in your head
for the erased face
he
left a trace in your heart
burning forever
and it's a cruel cruel world
it's a cruel cruel life
and the one that you love is gone
won't you tell me
how can you sleep at night
now can you feel alright
now that you are on your own
won't you tell me
on & on
life has just begun
chase the sun
i'll be close to you
keep your heart above
it's written in your bones

you
left a place in your head
for your lover up there
he
left a trace in your heart
burning forever
and it's a cruel cruel world
it's a cruel cruel life
and the one that you love is gone
won't you tell me
how can you sleep at night
how can you feel alright
now that you are on your own
won't you tell me
on & on
life has just begun
chase the sun
i'll be close to you
keep your heart above
it's written in your bones
