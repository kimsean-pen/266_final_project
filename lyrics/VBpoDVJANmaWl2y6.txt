In a far off place
In a far off town
I had a vision
Of you and I

But the first time I saw you
Must have been the night
I fell down the stairs
And you laughed till you cried

Then my sky generated thunder
I bathed in light, went out with a smile

I tell you what, let's make a deal
If I take the gas and you'll take the wheel
And I'll put on the second side of Hunky Dory

The last time I saw you
Must have been the night
I fell asleep at the wheel and died

Then my sky generated thunder
I bathed in light, went out with a smile

Hello Jesus, Hello Elvis
It's good to see ya's
Hey grandma,
You're looking good
I knew you would

My sky generated thunder
I bathed in light, went out in style
Went out in style
Went out in style
Went out in style
