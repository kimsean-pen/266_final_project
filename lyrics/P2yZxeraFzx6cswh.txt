There's a girl in the crowd
And she's balling her eye's out
Only girl in the town
With her fingers in eyelids

And we're all fine in the back of your mind
If we do what we like then we could be with you tonight
If we bleed you dry

We're alright in the back of our minds if we do what we like
Then we could be with you tonight
If they bleed you dry

Taken half the tide
Taken all your tide
If we bleed you dry

Bleed you dry
We've taken half your tide
If we bleed you dry

You are the bearer of a womb without love
You could of had it all
Is that what you said
Is that what you said on a low ride
You said in your hands you'll stay, all with me today (x2)

There's a hand in the till
Still believing what she sells
Only girl in the town
With her fingers in eyelids

We're all fine in the back of your mind
If we do what you like
Then we could be with you tonight
If they bleed you dry
Taken half the tide
Taken all your tide

Chorus

Bleed you dry
I'm taking half your tide
And if I bleed you dry
