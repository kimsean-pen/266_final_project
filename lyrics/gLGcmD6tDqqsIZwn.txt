In a snitch like this
You gotta think and I don't think you
Think about the way he thinks
And I know you live life
For yourself
But it all comes down to
The way you help

And I know your life is such a hell
You wake up early and you work until
You have your drinks at 5 o'clock
The hours blend and your thoughts
All haunt your hopes, your dreams
Your everything
Well, mama, I hope
I dream that you won't leave

And I have a question:
What is love?
What is love?
Oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh
Is it giving up?
'Cause that's not how you
Raised me, yeah.

In a snitch like this you gotta think
And I don't think you think
About the way she thinks
And I know you work hard everyday
But it all comes down
To the way you're paid

And I know you're oh so sorry dad
I truly believe that you're a better man
Than to share one kiss and then give away
From the love you come home everyday
Your hopes, your dreams, your everything
Well daddy, I hope, I dream
That she won't leave

And I have a question:
What is love?
What is love?
Oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh
Is it giving up?
'Cause that's not how you
Raised me

And what is love?
What is love?
Oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh
See, I don't know anymore
I used to look
Up to
That love
