On the verge I'm a fragile design
Will I wake in a world of fire
As a part inside of me just wants to die
Feel my DNA's changing and twisting my mind

There's a monster within me
Let me out of here
Change my destiny

Will I wake with a life to remember
Now I'm frozen and cold
I am left alone
With an empty soul
As I put the future on hold

Needles and cables plugged into machines
My memory's fighting
Half man half machine

What I learned
I was part of a plan
Yet I'm waiting for new directions

There's a monster within me
Let me out of here
From captivity

Will I wake with a life to remember
Now I'm frozen and cold
I am left alone
With an empty soul
As I put the future on hold

Divine
I render the gods design
Humanity's fading
Why can't I die

Will I wake with a life to remember
Now I'm frozen and cold
I am left alone
With an empty soul
As I put the future on hold
Will I wake with a life to remember
Now I'm frozen and cold
I am left alone
With an empty soul
As I put the future on hold
