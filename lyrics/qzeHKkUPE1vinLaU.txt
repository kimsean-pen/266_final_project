I didn't come this far
For you to make this hard for me
And now you want to ask me "how"?
It's like how does your heart beat, why do you breathe?
How does your heart beat and why do you breathe?

Why did you come here? You weren't invited
You were on the outside, stay on the outside
And now you want to ask me "why"?
It's like how does your heart beat and how do you cry?
How does your heart beat?

And there are some things that I'd like to figure out
There are some things that I can do without
You and your letters that go on forever
You and the people that were never friends
Never friends, never friends

With all the things that you could be
You never could learn how to be me
And now you want to ask me "how"?
It's like how does your heart beat, why do you breathe?
How does your heart beat, why do you breathe?

How do you breathe?
