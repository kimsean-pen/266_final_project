Sharpen up the guillotine, as fashionistas clean the scene
You're socially bewitched with narrative affixed
Tried and executed with no due process

Do you fight the good fight? Or instigate the fighting?
It's a fucking witch-hunt, somebody's head's gotta roll...
In New Salem

Burn the books, rename the streets,
nothing is safe, suppress the speech
A virtual conflict, binary logic, who the fuck is the strawman now?

Do you fight the good fight? Or instigate the fighting?
It's a fucking witch-hunt, co-opted activists divide and conquer us
Somebody's head's gotta roll

New Salem, somebody's head's gotta roll, new Salem
Co-opted activists divide and conquer us
Somebody's head's gotta roll

In a pacified endemic state, it's another echo-chamber slave
Addicted to extremes of ideologies
Where left and right amalgamate and hang us from their tallest trees

Do you fight the good fight? Or instigate the fighting?
It's a fucking witch-hunt, somebody's head's gotta roll

In an echo chamber no one can hear you scream
Burning the strawman in this knee-jerk nightmare
Roiling in all your virtue valor, awakening as a victim martyr
Freedom fighter, or bald-faced instigator?

Do you fight the good fight? Or instigate the fighting?
It's a fucking witch-hunt, somebody's head's gotta roll

New Salem, Somebody's head's gotta roll, new Salem
Co-opted activists divide and conquer us
Somebody's head's gotta roll
