Well I was never that good in school
English was not my forte but I fought for you
Distraction was just a reaction to you
Cause there's nothing, no there's nothing I wouldn't do, for you
No there's nothing, no there's nothing I wouldn't do.

You were my Geography girl
Climate change didn't matter cause you changed my world
Was never in the football team
You were the only thing to occupy my dreams

My highschool heart was bursting at the seams
Cause there's nothing, no there's nothing I wouldn't do, for you
No there's nothing, no there's nothing

I never liked ----------??
I didn't need my heart so I lent it to you
Was alright, it's alright, we're alright

You hug me, hold me so tight
It's the only time I felt I got it right
Well alright, we're alright, was alright, we're all right
