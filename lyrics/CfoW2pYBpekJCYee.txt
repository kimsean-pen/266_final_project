Oh got my hands tied round my back and time put a rope around my head and hung from the rafters of my fear
Dark in the eyes i try and feel somewhere
I can't bear to, my knees hit the ground and my hand starts shaking
Old feelings from new faces
A rope on the floor and a poor man hanging
Please help me chop this tree down
Hold me from not turning
Words never once brought me down
Oh dont you cry for me

And ive seen an ocean run away
And dont from the truth that holds my song
Well down in the grave where i belong
Oh what a ride i identify
My devil winks to the sky on a run from trouble
When my own hands know trouble
I drop to the ground now im hangin above

Please help me chop this tree down
And hold me from underneath
Words never once put me down
Oh don't you cry for me

Down by the grave that the long man laid when the gravel got paved finally im saved
Well Down by the grave that the long man laid when the gravel got paved finally im saved
Well Down by the grave that the long man laid when the gravel got paved finally im saved
Well Down by the grave that the long man laid when the gravel got paved finally im saved

When the sun went down
It set the sky on fire
It saw an angel fly
I never felt so high

Please help me chop this tree down
And hold me from underneath
Words never once put me down
Oh don't you cry for me
Oh don't you cry for me
Oh don't you cry for me
