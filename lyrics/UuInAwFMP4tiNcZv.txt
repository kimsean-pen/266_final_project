With you, life moves so fast
With you, everything's the last
Slow down
Don't you think you could be less capricious
I've met you, I don't have no death wish
Slow down, slow down
With you, there is no denying
It's you, not my lack of trying
With you, everybody's dying
It's you, it's not me who's crying
Crying, crying, crying, crying
With you, staying home tidy from the streets
With you, every friend is a possible freak
Slow down, slow down
With you, it's a foregone conclusion
With you, empty, it's all a delusion
With you, I can have no illusions
It's you, who has such delusions
Crying, crying, crying, crying
With you, everyone's a sucker
With you, it's got to be your father
Slow down, slow down
With you, life is just a scramble
With you, every day it's a gamble
With you, I can't get my bearings
With you, playing the Virgin Mary
And your crying, crying, crying, crying
Crying, crying
