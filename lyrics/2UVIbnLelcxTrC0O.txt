Hold your fire
I'm coming out and I'll tell you the truth
I was trying to raise my roof
Did you see it
That I needed to prove
That my stinger always stays
You said she's beautiful when she plays
Did I hit you in the proper place

Suddenly

[Chorus 1]
I, oh well I could live in this town
Five cold years before I
Yes I could live in this town
Before I head for home

It's my turn
With the spotlight burning a hole
But my bird-heart's turning cold
As the temperature rises all around
To the sound of a ticking bomb
And then it's not just showing off here
You know there's something going on here
Going on here

Suddenly

[Chorus 2]
I, oh well I could live in this town
Five cold years before I
Yes I could live in this town
Five cold years
Yes I could live in this town
Five cold years before I
Well I could live in this town
Before I head for home

And considered it odd
That I ever stayed

You know that feeling you get
when you don't want to leave

That feeling when you don't want to leave

[Chorus]
I, oh well I could live in this town
Five cold years before I
Yes I could live in this town
Five cold years
Yes I could live in this town
Five cold years before I
Well I could live in this town
Before I head for home

And considered it odd
That I ever stayed
