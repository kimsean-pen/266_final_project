Here I sit my head in my hands
While all the men in balaclavas they start making demands
I am a rat in a cage in a boiler suit
Drowned in fear but burning soon

I know, I know, I know I ain't walking away
I know, I know, I know that there is no escape
So I make my peace with whoever I trust
Then shut my eyes and turn to dust
I know, I know, I know I ain't walking away

Here I sit in these shackles and chains
While all the men in balaclavas give my country away
I am a rat in a cage without a choice
And there's no future without a voice

I know, I know, I know I ain't walking away
I know, I know, I know that there is no escape

I'm in trouble, and I'm going under
I crack like lightning, and I break like thunder
I'm in trouble and there's no way out
I'm in trouble and I'm breaking down

I know, I know, I know I ain't walking away
I know, I know, I know that there is no escape

I'm in trouble, and I'm going under
I crack like lightning, and I break like thunder
I'm in trouble and there's no way out
I'm in trouble and I'm breaking down
