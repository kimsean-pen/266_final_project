All they say you're not their friend
You've been through the thick and thin
And for that little boy I love you
And all I want to do is talk about you
I'm here to say I love you more each day
And I just want to tell the world that I love you so sugar

Though they put me down because
I love you as much as I do
But they don't know what you've done for me
You made such a happy girl out of me
I'm here to say I love you more each day, yeah
I just want to tell the world that I love you so
Well I love, I love, I love, I love
I love every little thing about you baby
I love, I love, I love, I love

All them say I am wrong 'cause my love is strong
There's only one that l place above you
I forever place God above anyone and even you
I'm here to say I love you more each day yeah
I just want to tell the world that I love you so baby

Some might say it's strange but my whole life you've changed
You saved all the pain the world's put on me
And all I want to do is talk about how happy I am
I'm here to say I love you more each day
I just want to tell the world that I love you so yeah
