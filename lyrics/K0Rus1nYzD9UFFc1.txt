It took 10 years to realise
Why the angels start to cry
When you go home down the main your
Happy smile your funny name
I'm not really mean so don't take it hard
When I ask you to run on the yard
It's so hopeless to be fine
Why you jump to close the blinds
You know i love you if i could but both my arms are made of wood
Just don't mean the things I say
It's only cos you're made that way
Sorry for laughing
There's too much happening
Sorry for laughing
There's too much happening
When we move on into town
Shores happily (?) start to frown
She's not made like me and you
Just can't do the things we do
It's times like these you have to pay
So sorry to turn on that way
