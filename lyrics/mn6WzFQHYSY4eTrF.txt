Rust colored
And worn in
Like a second hand boot
The heart has a home
In Castle Dome

Glass eyed
And frozen over
Like an early spring
Somehow you've never felt more warm
In Castle Dome

The door creaks
Like it did when I was a child
Falling too hard
On the leaning tree
In Castle Dome

Dry heave
The new handshake
But you don't want to meet
Anyone you know
In Castle Dome

Dust covered
And blowing over
The grifter gifts so true
In Castle Dome
The heart has a home

Everybody
Everybody
Everybody sees me now

Everybody
Everybody
Everybody believes
