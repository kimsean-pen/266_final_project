Survivor in the ocean
Sails the raft, his only hope
He has no clue, no notion
Where is some land and where's his home.

So he closed his eyes and saw his Motherland
He was praying to a God

Free me, free
From my past
And my future disappears in my sins
What I see? are the tears I caused

Survivor in the ocean
Made a promise to himself
To live, to be devoted
And to find a saving shelf

So he closed his eyes and saw his Motherland
He was praying to a God

Free me, free
From my past
And my future disappears in my sins
What I see? are the tears I caused
Free me, free
I see what you mean
Me, me in the ocean of tears

Keep me out of trouble
Fix my broken mirror
Keep me out of dust
I won't be afraid anymore
Life is just a bubble
I am not a hero
Watch me swimming ashore
Wash my tears away

Free me, free
I see what you mean
Me, me in the ocean of tears
