See you drinking on the rocks baby
And there ain't no sound of stopping baby
And there ain't no time for talking baby
Put in work it's time to clock in
Let's be honest
Girl I go the longest
Liquor and a soda
Bad bitch being modest
And i can tell your boyfriend ain't enough
So just tell me girl what's in your cup
Yeah, yeah

Maybe it's because I'm off 'em drugs
I got hella liquor in my system
Is it me or we in love?
You got a man I think you should ditch him
I got what you want
I got what you need
Talking you, me and hennessy
Baby we just need another drink
Talking you, me and hennessy
I got what you want
I got what you need
Talking you, me and hennessy
Baby we just need another drink
Talking you, me and hennessy

Yeah, yeah, yeah wait
Okay, put the henny in my cup
Could we be in love or could it be the drugs
Or could it be the weed
Maybe all of the above
Girl goddamn got a couple of bad habits
Can you blame me that I want the baddest
Blame me with the henny in my system
(?) Ass the baddest, the fattest
Is you fucking with me or is it all for show?
Must admit that when we let these feelings out to grow
No you see me grow
See me when you show
Know you felt that spark back we sparked up and rolled up
Aye, tell me baby that you down
Aye, 'bout to get another round
Aye, baby use your body language, I dont want to hear a sound
Aye, need to get your ass to my damn room I don't fuck with crowds
Aye, navigating kush clouds
Aye, got you fucking with me now

Maybe it's because I'm off 'em drugs
I got hella liquor in my system
Is it me or we in love?
You got a man I think you should ditch him
I got what you want
I got what you need
Talking you, me and hennessy
Baby we just need another drink
Talking you, me and hennessy
I got what you want
I got what you need
Talking you, me and hennessy
Baby we just need another drink
Talking you, me and hennessy
Hennessy
