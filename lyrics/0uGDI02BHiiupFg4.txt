Along the way
Mistakes were made
They'll call it fate
A world of slaves
Driven insane
And thrown away
Along the way
Mistakes were made
They'll call it fate
A world of slaves
Driven insane
And thrown away

Like birds to worms
We don't need them
We just feed them
None of our concerns
Will ever reach them
We are beneath them

Deprivation
Annihilation

Along the way
Mistakes were made
They'll call it fate
A world of slaves
Driven insane
And thrown away

A world of slaves

Among the ones who've given up
Loathing and dead weight
Has held us down for long enough
We'll forge a pathway

Nothing is seamless
Reset the sequence
A world of slaves

Along the way
Mistakes were made
They'll call it fate
A world of slaves
Driven insane
And thrown away
Along the way
Mistakes were made
They'll call it fate
A world of slaves
Driven insane
And thrown away

A world of slaves
