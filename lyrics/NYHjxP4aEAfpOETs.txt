I got a little something that I wanna lay out
It took a little while before I figured it out
'Cause I've grown tired of tryna win you back but now
I got a little something that I need to say

Now you're gone
You should know
That I won't be following you, no
'Cause I don't need your shit no more, no more
I'm just letting you know

I'll be fine here on my own
I thought you were the one for me but I was wrong
I can see the bright blue skies now that you're gone
I don't need a goddamn thing from anyone

I got a little something weighing on my mind
'Cause I can't help but feel that you were wasting my time
'Cause I've got so much more without you in my life
I've got a little something that I need to say right

Now you're gone
You should know
That I won't be following you, no
'Cause I don't need your shit no more, no more
I'm just letting you know

I'll be fine here on my own
I thought you were the one for me but I was wrong
I can see the bright blue skies now that you're gone
I don't need a goddamn thing from anyone

I'll be fine here on my own
I thought you were the one for me but I was wrong
I can see the bright blue skies now that you're gone
I don't need a goddamn thing from anyone

I'll be fine here on my own
I thought you were the one for me but I was wrong
I can see the bright blue skies now that you're gone
I don't need a goddamn thing from anyone
