Soon... winter again...
...snowlord come...
Come and cover those grey walls...

...VIOLENCE CALLS!
I want his fall...
his epic fall... in this evil war...
...fought to protect our ancient throne

From this grey prison I look at you
my lost and beloved wasted holy town
I call the prophecy's miracle
the thunder of the ancient book's word

WE ARE...
WE ARE THE ONES...
WHO'LL FACE THE STEELGODS OF THIS LAST
APOCALYPSE... 2X
...LAST APOCALYPSE!

Now... Algalord lies...
in the shades...
of my shy mystic rainbow...

...VIOLENCE CALLS!
I want his fall...
his epic fall... in this evil war...
...trapped behind these humid walls

Raise all your eyes to the autumn skies
capture the energy of that sight
They can have fun with my limbs and bones
but I swear my spirit will never fall

WE ARE...
WE ARE THE ONES...
WHO'LL FACE THE STEELGODS OF THIS LAST
APOCALYPSE... 2X
...LAST APOCALYPSE!

(acoustics)

WE ARE...
WE ARE THE ONES...
WHO'LL FACE THE STEELGODS OF THIS LAST
APOCALYPSE... 2X
...LAST APOCALYPSE!
