Jimmy go down to music town
Buy a synthesizer, nothing down
He don't need an amp for it
He got sixteen tracks and a straitjacket
Baby, I'm a rhythm ace

I can make it naughty, I can make it nice
I can make it any way, choose your own device

Big electronic, big electronic, beat
Big electronic, big electronic, beat
Big electronic, big electronic, beat

Computer language he can speak
Love his digital physique
When he plays the soft machine
Ooh I want to scream!
Baby, I'm a sequencer

Big electronic, big electronic, beat
Big electronic, big electronic, beat

Big electronic, big electronic, beat
Big electronic, big electronic, beat
Big electronic, big electronic, beat

Jimmy recorded in a jet
Want to hear it on cassette
The sound that makes you tap your feet
The big electronic beat
Hear me, I'm a time effect

I can make it naughty, I can make it nice
I can make it any way, choose your own device

Big electronic, big electronic, beat
Big electronic, big electronic, beat
Big electronic, big electronic, beat

Big electronic, big electronic, beat
Big electronic, big electronic, we got the beat
Big electronic, big electronic, beat

Big electronic, big electronic, beat...
We got the big electronic, big electronic, beat...
Big electronic, big electronic, beat...
