I'm trying, give me a second
I wanna take the time to do what's right
'Cause I can't rush decisions, give me a second

All of your pressure brings
Making me question things, "Do I want ya?" "Do I need ya?"
I know what you're tryna hear
And I wanna say it to you but you need to

Wait, mmm, wait

I'm not ignoring your feelings
But right now it's just hard to put yours in front of mine
'Cause I've got my own reasons, give them a second

All of your pressure brings
Making me question things, "Do I want ya?" "Do I need you?"
I know what you're tryna hear
And I wanna say it to you but you need to

Wait, mmm, wait

Stop! go

Wait, mmm, wait
Wait, mmm, wait

Stop!
