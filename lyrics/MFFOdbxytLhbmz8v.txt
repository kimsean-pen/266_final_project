Moody (It's got me) x 7
Baby, why'd you have to leave?
Something up your sleeve?
Baby, I find it hard to breath

Moody (It's got me) x 8
Baby, why'd you have to leave?
Why'd you have to break free?
Why'd you have to go?

Moody (It's got me) x 7
Baby, why'd you have to run?
Looking after number one?
Baby, why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to phone? (?)
Something you're afraid to show? (?)
Someone else you'd rather phone? (?)

Moody (It's got me) Mooday (It's got me)...
