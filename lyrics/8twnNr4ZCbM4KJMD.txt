She thinks she's all alone
And all her hopes are gone
And so I wrote this song
So she can move along
Things were bad
She was in despair
Things were bad
And you were never there
But things were bad
She came up for air
She said a little prayer
She found herself
Yeah she's got light in her face
She don't need no rescuing she's okay
Yeah, she's got life in her veins
She don't need no rescuing she's okay

No S.O.S. needed, no rescuing, she's fine out there
No S.O.S. needed, no rescuing, she's fine out there
Yeah, she's got life in her veins
She don't need no rescuing
She's okay.
She looks into the sky
And all her tears are dry
She kiss her fears goodbye
She's gonna be alright
Things were bad
It was beyond repair
She was scare
She couldn't handle it
Things were bad
But now she's glad
Can't you tell that she's walking on air?

Yeah, she's got light in her face
She don't need no rescuing, she's okay
Yeah, she's got life in her veins
She don't need no rescuing, she's okay
No S.O.S. needed, no rescuing, she's fine out there
No S.O.S. needed, no rescuing, she's fine out there
Yeah, she's got life in her veins
She don't need no rescuing, she's okay.
That girl is you yeah and that girl is me
That girl is stronger than the raging sea
That girl is you yeah and that girl is me
That girl is stronger than the raging sea
Yeah, she's got light in her face
She don't need no rescuing, she's okay
Yeah, she's got life in her veins
She don't need no rescuing she's okay.
No S.O.S. needed, no rescuing, she's fine out there
No S.O.S. needed, no rescuing, she's fine out there
Yeah, she's got life in her veins
She don't need no rescuing, she's okay
