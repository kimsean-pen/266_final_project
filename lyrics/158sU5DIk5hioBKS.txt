A fiery rose, a lethal dose
You'll catch her brown eyes at the heart of every storm
A broken grace with an ageless face
The softest hands of any touch
Pushes you over the edge

Lights on, pounding in your head
Shoes off and you're dancing in the middle
Forget, you're all that's left
And you're dancing in the middle, dancing in the middle

I wanna live in your house
I wanna live in your house, Bonnie, Bonnie
I wanna see through your eyes, run away to your life
Bonnie, Bonnie

A sudden rush, so sweetly rough
You get a glimpse of love
Before she shakes it off
Sending you over the edge

Drums still pounding in your head
Shoes off and you're dancing in the middle
Forget, you're all that's left
And you're dancing in the middle, dancing in the middle

I wanna live in your house
I wanna live in your house, Bonnie, Bonnie
I wanna see from your eyes, run away to your life
Bonnie, Bonnie

Take my hand and spin me in your circles, Bonnie
So take me back to your house
I want to live in your house, Bonnie
Bonnie, Bonnie
And you'll be dancing in the middle
Take me, take me, take me to the middle

I wanna live in your house, I wanna live in your house
I wanna see through your eyes, run away to your life
Bonnie, Bonnie
Take my hand and spin me in your circles, Bonnie
So take me back to your house
I want to live in your house, Bonnie, Bonnie, Bonnie
