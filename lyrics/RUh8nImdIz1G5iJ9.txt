We used to play in the warm sun
On holiday and you held my hand

But you fell like glass on my lap
And I couldn't fix you
Put you back together again
Could I-I don't think so ooh, ooh

I won't take it personal
I won't take it personally
Cause it ain't about me at all
No it ain't about me at all

We used to sing (Ooh) with your guitar
(That's the way we used to sing)
The melody (ooh melody) rings in my heart
(In my heart)

But you fell like glass on my lap
And I couldn't fix you
(Fix you, fix you, you)
Put you back together again
Could I-I don't think so ooh
(Think so, think so ooh)

I won't take it personal
I won't take it personally
Cause it ain't about me at all
No it ain't about me at all

Now I never would've thought that you would leave me
I never would've guessed that you would go
I looked up to you like stars in the evening
When they glow
Now I wonder if you'd even recognize me
You changed me on the day you walked away
(You walked away)
And I have to adapt all of my senses
To this cold and empty space

I won't take it personal
I won't take it personally
(Don't wanna take- oh)
Cause it ain't about me at all
(Ooh no)
No it ain't about me at all
(Ooh no,no)
I won't take it personal
(I don't want to take it)
I won't take it personally
(Personally)
Cause it ain't about me at all, all
(I won't take it)
No it ain't about me at all
(Won't take it personally)
I won't take it personal
