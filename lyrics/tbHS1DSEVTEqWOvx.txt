When tomorrow comes
I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened of
The things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
Darkness all around, no hope that I could fly
And I sing along, I sing along, and I sing along
I got all I need when I got you and I
'Cause I look around me, and see a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Kick start my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
I can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
You're my flashlight
You're my flashlight
You're my flashlight
I see the shadows long beneath the mountain top
But I'm not the afraid when the rain won't stop
'Cause you light the way
You light the way, you light the way
I got all I need when I got you and I
'Cause I look around me, and see a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night

Kick start my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
I can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night, night, night
You're my flashlight, light, light
And you can't deny
With you it's a sweet life, life, life
I got all I need when I got you and I
'Cause I look around me, and a see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Kick start my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
I can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
You're my flashlight
You're my flashlight
You're my flashlight
You're my flashlight
You're my flashlight
You're my flashlight, oh
