I need to take a vacation
If this is settling down
Then why aren't you here?
I want a big celebration

The night we get back in town
And I hope you're all there
But leave the waves at the ocean,
Keep them all in a picture

And leave the cold
Where we came from
Our loneliness will keep us warm
We're going going going very far

I need to take a vacation
If this is settling down
Then why aren't you here?
I want a big celebration

The night we get back in town
And I hope you're all there
Leave the past out to pasture
And take the days as they come
And leave the sand in a suitcase
So we don't forget the fun
We're going going going very far
We're going going going very far
I need to take a vacation
If this is settling down
Then why aren't you here?
I want a big celebration
The night we get back in town
And I hope you're all there
And I hope you're all there
And I hope you're all there
