Late at night I switch on my radio
I sing myself a lullaby
I close my eyes and wait
Till the wind blows round the corner
Bringing back the memories to me, uhh yeah
Well we dreamed our lives, and we lived our dreams
We've sacreficed our future for a heart of rock'n roll

Won't forget these days
And I never thought I would
Won't forget these days, uhh I
Won't forget these days
And I never thought I would
Won't forget these days
Won't forget these days

Everybody's so important and they all wanna cheat you
Learn it by heart, right from the start
Bread is bread and you can even eat it
Count what you've sold but gold remains cold
Young boys take their dirty hands and swear
Nothing should come between us
But mostly it comes earlier, than anybody wants it

Won't forget these days
And I never thought I would
Won't forget these days, uhh I
Won't forget these days
And I never thought I would
Won't forget these days

I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't
I won't forget
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't
I won't forget, uhh I
I won't forget
And I never thought I would
Uhh, I won't forget
And I never thought I would

Won't forget these days
And I never thought I would
Won't forget these days, uhh I
Won't forget these days
And I never thought I would
Won't forget these days
