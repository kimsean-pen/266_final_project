He who seeks of only vanity,
And no love for humanity,
Shall fade away, fade away.

He who checks for only wealth,
And not for his physical health,
Shall fade away, fade away.

Though some believe in diamonds and pearl,
And feel like they're on top of the world,
They shall fade away, hear what I say.

The rich is getting richer every day,
And the little that the poor man got,
It shall betaken away.
Do you hear what I say? Yeah, hear what I say.
The man who worships silver and gold,
Shall surely, surely, surely lose his own soul,
Then fade away.

The one who's always acting smart,
And don't carry no love in his heart,
Shall fade away.

God is here and there and everywhere,
And he knows when you play the game unfair,
So people beware, or else you fade away!
Hey! Beware, or dare you fade away.
You've gotta fade, gotta fade, gotta fade now.

The rich is getting richer every day,
And the little that the poor man got,
It shall be taken away.
Do you hear what I say, hey? Hear what I say.

The one who's always acting smart,
And forgetting to carry love in his heart,
Shall fade away.

God is here and there and everywhere,
And his eyes, his eyes are watching you,
You're gonna fade away, yeah, yeah,
You're goin' to fade, fade, fade, fade away.
Fade away. yeah, yeah.
