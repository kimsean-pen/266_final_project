I'd really love to be alone without all the
Ache and pain and the April showers
But it ain't long before I long for you, like a
Ray of hope, coming through the blue moon
When it all gets dark again
The whole thing falls apart I guess
It doesn't really matter 'bout the rain
'Cause we'll get through it anyway
We'll get up and start again
'Cause we could be lifted, lifted, lifted
We could be lifted
From the shadows, lifted
Oh, we could be, lifted up today
Lifted all the way, you and I forever
Baby, lifted, lifted, lifted, hey
It's undisturbable the peace we found
In a bright new space up above the clouds
Everything is understandable
You don't have to say anything too loud
When all our luck runs out again
We're brought back down to solid ground
I wouldn't say I'm mad about the rain
But we'll get through it anyway
We'll get back to the start again
'Cause we could be lifted, lifted, lifted
We could be lifted
From the shadows, lifted
Oh, we could be, lifted up today
Lifted all the way, you and I forever
Baby, lifted, we could be lifted, we could be lifted, hey
We could be lifted, we could be lifted
We could be lifted, you and I forever
We could be lifted, we could be lifted
Yeah we could be lifted
We could be lifted up to new horizons
Lifted, lifted up today, lifted all the way
Yeah, we could be lifted, we could be lifted
From the shadows, we could be lifted
Lifted upto new horizons
When it all gets dark again
It doesn't really matter 'bout the rain
When it all gets dark again
It doesn't really matter 'bout the rain
