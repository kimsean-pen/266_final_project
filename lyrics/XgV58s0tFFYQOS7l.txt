"you drank of the chalice of satan's blood"

you know we pass from death to life
because we love each other
anyone who does not love remains in death
anyone who hates his brother has broken this command:

"thou shall not murder
thou shall not kill"

"...nancy was a goddamn friend of mine"

this is how we know what love is
jesus christ lay down his life
for us and we are to lay down our lives

"you know you drank of his blood"

thou shall not murder
you've broken this command
thou shall not kill

"...you will pay for your sins
satan hates your goddamn guts
you drank his blood"
