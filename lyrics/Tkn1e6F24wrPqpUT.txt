Yesterday I came back for more
Even though I knew nothing changed
And I knew it was hard for you
I still expect you to want me
And now I'm tangled into your life
'Cause that's the kind of girl I am
(Lights off, baby, I know you need me)
So we sit by the street light
You know I need your emotion tonight
I fooled myself into thinking

We're gonna figure it out
We're gonna figure it out
(I don't care, I will lose my mind)
(I don't care, make me feel alright)
We're gonna figure it out
(I don't care, I will lose my mind)
(I don't care, make me feel)
We're gonna figure it out

A love that I could do it to for fun
My current unhappiness
Going dissatisfaction with
Everything that holds me down
I can't describe that feeling of being nobody's girlfriend
(Lights off, baby, I know you need me)
Now we sit by the street light
You know I need your emotion tonight
I fooled myself into thinking

We're gonna figure it out
We're gonna figure it out
(I don't care, I will lose my mind)
(I don't care, make me feel alright)
We're gonna figure it out
(I don't care, I will lose my mind)
(I don't care, make me feel)
We're gonna figure it out

We're gonna figure it out
(I don't care, make me feel alright)
Uh
Maybe we'll figure it out, uh
Maybe we'll figure it out
(I don't care, I will lose my mind)
Maybe we'll, maybe we'll, maybe we'll be alright
(I don't care, make me feel alright)
(I don't care, I will lose my mind)
Maybe we'll, maybe we'll
(I don't care, make me feel)
Maybe we'll be alright
