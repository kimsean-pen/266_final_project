Hangin' out with lars down on 6th street
He knew I was in trouble
I was feeling much like the devil
There was something burnin' deep inside of me

Ran into three puerto ricans
These girls took us to the funhouse
Where we played a lonely pinball machine

Hangin' on the corner of 52nd. and broadway
Cars passin' by but none of them seem to be goin' my way

New york city well I wish I was on a highway
Back to olympia...

I'm having a hard time understanding
It gets all too demanding
She's all gone and I'm stranded
Something burning deep inside of me

All I know it's 4'o'clock and
She ain't never showed up
And I watched a thousand people go home from work

How many times will it take me
Before I go crazy
Before I lose everything
Something burning deep inside of
Me ran into three puerto ricans
Those girls took us to the funhouse
I don't wanna be alone again.
