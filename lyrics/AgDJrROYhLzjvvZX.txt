I don't need to be sociable
I don't need to be probable
There's no need to make sense at all
Or to be a brick in their wall

Low, low, low
Dissasociative glow, no, no
Got no time to kill, no
Got the means to be mean
Got the means to be free
From the talking machines

And I don't need to be
A model of conformity
You know?
And I don't need an alibi for sanity
Cause I'm my own

I don't care to be likeable
If that means to be predictable
I ain't gonna answer your beck and call
As it makes my world grey and dull

Low, low, low
Dissasociative glow, no, no
Got no time to kill, no
Got the means to be mean
Got the means to be free
From the talking machines

And I don't need to be
A model of conformity
You know?
And I don't need an alibi for sanity
Cause I'm my own
