I sit myself high upon a mountain top and I look far, far across the hills
I'm so loaded, man, so deep and full, with all the love and all that is real
We gotta cry out and reach out and turn our twisted minds
And feel the connection that is between you and all that is alive

To be with the smallest and biggest without fear and pride
I went through the chapel of dangers a few hundred times
And I had to work so hard to keep my love and intuition
Not to lose my guts and not to lose my mind
I reach out, a step forward, I stumble and I fall
All my greed and longing wasn't for real at all

So reach out, reach out, get a hand brothers and sisters
Grow on your kindness, love harmony and peace
Empty yourselves of everything, gain in losing, thrive in your freedom
I tried, but I'm sure you will
