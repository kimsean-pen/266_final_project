Your first contact
You hit a lonely soul
It cut deep enough

Until we break it
Until the air flows
You shiver until we touch
Until these butterflies leave my head
Until the day breaks
We go dark but
Let's not forget who we are
You run your, your figure
Through cracks in the starlit sky

There's a danger in your eyes
You're a predator
A little predator

Escape the streets tonight
I don't know where to run
Just let the tyres burn

Until we get there, keep focus
Head down and covered in dust
Until an ocean size is in between
Until the Earth shakes
We steer straight into the heart of the storm
And when it all spins white
Welcome to the other side
Keep the thunder in your sky

There's a danger in your eyes
You're a predator
A little predator

I could see them coming
They came in force
With strength, we rode the storm
At the end of the story
Just remember the honour among thieves

There's a danger in your eyes
You're a predator
A little predator
