I don't know why you cry
You must have a windswept eye
They're the same old tears you've worn for years
So they suit you better than I

I don't know why you cry
The tears are a strange device
They roll like dice, they're cold like ice
And they suit you better than I

You don't want me
But you need me
You don't have to
But you should do

'Cause I may be the only one
(In the world)
Yeah, I may be the only one
(In the world)

Oh, I may be the only one
(In the land)
Yeah, I may be the only one
(Who understands you, yeah)

So if you're feeling lonesome today
Honey, don't you dare to push me away
'Cause I may be the only one
(In the land)
Yeah, I may be the only one
Who understands you, yeah

I'll take you for a ride
To see you from inside
The outlook's bleak but when I speak
I'll see a change in your tide

I don't know why you cry
But honey make it mine
'Cause up my sleeve, I do believe
I'll change those tears into wine

You don't want me
But you need me
You don't have to
But you should do

'Cause I may be the only one
(In the world)
Yeah, I may be the only one
(In the world)

Oh, I may be the only one
(In the land)
Yeah, I may be the only one
(Who understands you, yeah)

You can't see wood for all the trees
For you I'm good, permission please
To be your girl, to hold you tight
To rock your world

You know I'm right
So come on, baby, you better make a move
I won't wait forever
What have you got to lose?

'Cause I may be the only one
(In the world)
Yeah, I may be the only one
(In the world)

Oh, I may be the only one
(In the land)
Yeah, I may be the only one
(Who understands you, yeah)

'Cause I may be the only one
(In the world)
Yeah, I may be the only one
(In the world)

Oh, I may be the only one
(In the land)
Yeah, I may be the only one
(Who understands you, yeah)
