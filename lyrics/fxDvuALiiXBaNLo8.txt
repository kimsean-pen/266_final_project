I have a heart that gets on everybody's nerves
They don't want the truth, they just want the words
Bla bla bla bla bla and I can sing until I'm dead
And none of you'll remember a single thing I said

What's the point in being a voice when everyone's already sick of the noise?
Everyone's already sick of the noise, everyone's already sick of the noise
What's the point in trying to change when everyone's already stuck in their ways
Everyone's happy with more of the same, more of the same, more of the same

We were born kicking and screaming
Until we learned to turn it down

Took our dreams and got in line
Held our breath and hoped to die
Fade on
And all along, we got it wrong
Live a slow and painful life
Put our heart on hold inside
Fade on
And all along, we got it wrong
Oh we keep it hush hush hush
Have you had enough, have you, have you had enough?
Took our dreams and got in line
Held our breath and hoped to die
Fade on
And all along, we got it wrong

I have a heart that gets on everybody's nerves
They don't want the truth, they just want the words

Oh I hate your static pace, you ask no questions, let things be
All you people never learn, and your heart gets on my nerves
And your heart gets on my nerves, and your heart gets on my nerves

We were born kicking and screaming
Until we learned to turn it down

Took our dreams and got in line
Held our breath and hoped to die
Fade on
And all along, we got it wrong
Live a slow and painful life
Put our heart on hold inside
Fade on
And all along, we got it wrong
Oh we keep it hush hush hush
Have you had enough, have you, have you had enough?
Took our dreams and got in line
Held our breath and hoped to die
Fade on
And all along, we got it wrong

But no one listens, 'cause no one cares
If you're alive at all let me see you stare
If you're alive at all let me see you stare

I have a heart that gets on everybody's nerves
They don't want the truth, they just want the words
They don't want the truth, they just want the words

Took our dreams and got in line
Held our breath and hoped to die
Fade on
And all along, we got it wrong
Live a slow and painful life
Put our heart on hold inside
Fade on
And all along, we got it wrong
Oh we keep it hush hush hush
Have you had enough, have you, have you had enough?
Took our dreams and got in line
Held our breath and hoped to die
Fade on
And all along, we got it wrong
We keep it hush hush hush
