Forever and ever, even today and after
I kept our picture forever
Back in the late 50's we went to the prom and kissing
But you went home with Tom Ripley

Throw the guy a meat bone, put him on a train
That's the way it should end
Living on the outskirts, 40 miles away
Where the lonely road ends

Forever and ever, even today and after
I still believe you can hear me
Believer, deceiver, the question lies beneath the letter
I wrote you in late May

Throw the guy a meat bone, put him on a train
That's the way it should end
Living on the outskirts, 40 miles away
Where the lonely road ends
Where the lonely road ends
Where The guitar gangsters sing
