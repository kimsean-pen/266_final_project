Heading from city to sea
Just you and me
Our boots creaking quietly
We would never be here again
Watching the snow falling down
Watching the city lose colour and sound
And we were looking
To find in the feather sky
The contour line from the summer
To Christmas time
For the what
For the when
When you were the snow falling down
When I was the city losing colour and sound
When we were
Sunk like treasure
Sunk like treasure
Sunk like treasure
Sunk like treasure
Heading from city to sea
One facing east
One looking westerly
We would never come back again
Watching the snow falling down
Watching the city lose colour and sound
And we were sunk like treasure
Sunk like treasure
Sunk like treasure
Sunk like treasure
Watching the snow falling down
Watching the city lose colour and sound
And we were sunk like treasure
Sunk like treasure
Sunk like treasure
Sunk like treasure
