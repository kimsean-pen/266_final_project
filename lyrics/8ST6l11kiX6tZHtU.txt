Bite my nails
This day is the day
Oh, how quickly
The ends are curving in
Splintered skin
Digging further in
Oh how quickly
The blood is seeping in

Make me stand
Make me rise
Help me feel alive
Make me stand
Make me rise
Help me feel alive

Stop my words
They're not your curse
I am sorry
That I ever let you in
You run wild
You're not afraid of time
How it slips for your forest
Faster than light

Make me stand
Make me rise
Help me feel alive
Make me stand
Make me rise
Help me feel alive
