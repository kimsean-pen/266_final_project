Hmmmm...
Car is parked, bags are packed
But what kind of heart doesn't look back
At the comfortable glow from the porch

The one I will still call yours?
All those words came undone
And now I'm not the only one
Facing the ghosts that decide

If the fire inside still burns
All I have, all I need
He's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands
Still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday

I'll breathe again, I'll breathe again
Open up next to you
And my secrets become your truth

And the distance between
That was sheltering me comes in full view
Hang my head
Break my heart

Built from all I have torn apart
And my burden to bear
Is a love I can't carry anymore
All I have, all I need
He's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands

Still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday
I'll breathe again
It hurts to be here

I only wanted love from you
It hurts to be here
What am I gonna do?
All I have, all I need

He's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands
Still I'm searching
All I have, all I need
He's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands
And still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday
I'll breathe again, I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again, I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again, I'll breathe again
