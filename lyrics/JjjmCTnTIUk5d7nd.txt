Helping the kids out of their coats
But wait the babies haven't been born
Unpacking the bags and setting up
And planting lilacs and buttercups

But in the meantime I've got it hard
Second floor living without a yard
It may be years until the day
My dreams will match up with my pay

Old dirt road
(Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee deep snow
(Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow
(Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old

I got a man to stick it out
And make a home from a rented house
And we'll collect the moments one by one
I guess that's how the future's done

How many acres, how much light
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
On a little road barely on the map

Old dirt road
(Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee deep snow
(Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow
(Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old
(Mushaboom, mushaboom)

Old dirt road
Rambling rose
(Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow
(Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Well, I'm sold
