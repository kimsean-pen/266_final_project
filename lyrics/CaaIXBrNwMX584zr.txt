Jennifer, J.LO
Now somehow you feel left out
Somehow you're feeling down

Got an inch but took a mile
Oh no
Right now your body's in need
Can't replace what you had in me

My words are cutting deep
Oh no
You watch me fall, now I'm colder than winter
My love, you forgot, let me help you remember

I love you like you never been
So overdose on your own medicine
There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much you're alone

Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, how come I'm the villain?
I told you that you would need my love
I gave you my all but that wasn't enough

Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain, baby I'm the villain of your love
I'm the villain
Baby, I'm the villain of your love

Oh, now you get the picture
Oh oh, now you wanna fix her

Oh now you're screaming let's go back
I ain't having that
But now my love ain't around
It's behind walls, I won't come down

But now you wanna show up
And turn my sour sweet, you gon' miss me
You watch me fall now, I'm colder than winter
My love you forgot, let me help you remember

I'll love you like you never been
So overdose on your own medicine
There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much you're alone
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, how come I'm a villain?
I told you that you would need my love
I gave you my all but that wasn't enough
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain, baby I'm the villain of your love
Now I'm the villain, baby I'm the villain of your love
I'm the villain
