I've got to see what's on the camera
I'm just a fiend for yesterday
How can you break out of its handle
I'm just a train of thought away

Away it goes, away it goes, away it goes
Away it goes, away it goes, away it goes

Everything's new
Everything's new
Beautiful city lights look bright tonight
And calling out for you
Everything's new

I'm not the type to run in circles
But I keep waking up the same
When getting over all the hurdles
You can't keep holding onto one just in case

Everything's new
Everything's new
Beautiful city lights look bright tonight
And calling out for you
Everything's new

Do what you do
And keep heading nowhere
I'm just a train of thought away
Stay on your pace, let the future beware
I'm just a train of thought away

It's all out of place and I'm carried away
And afraid to know why
Can you tell me again
There's a means to an end
For the tears in these eyes
It's all out of place and I'm carried away
And afraid to know why
Can you tell me again
There's a means to an end
For the tears in these eyes

Everything's new
Everything's new
Beautiful city lights look bright tonight
And calling out for you
Everything's new

I'm just a train of thought away
Another train of thought away

Beautiful city lights look bright tonight
And calling out for you
Everything's new

(I'm just a train of thought away)
(I'm just a train of thought away)
