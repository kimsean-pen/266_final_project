We gotta cross state lines to find ourselves
Drive a beat up car to a cheap motel
Scrub the dishes in the back pay our way Feel you wipe the suds from my face

I'm in love
So in love
What I wouldn't do
To be with you

They can't keep us apart
We've got to be free
OOh
And anything less
Is highway robbery

Living out of a case
That says your name
Blow the dirt from the road
out of your frames
Goodbyes too hard
We decide to stay
Let the rest of the world fall away

I'm in love
So in love
What I wouldn't do
To be with you

They can't keep us apart
We've got to be free
OOh
And anything less
Is highway robbery

Hey mister you've got an obsession
Lucky for you
I'm headed in that direction
Got me feeling it deep
Cause we got this connection
What do you say we run away?

They can't keep us apart
We've got to be free
OOh
And anything less
Is highway robbery
