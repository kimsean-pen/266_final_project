Sad disolusioned
We've burned from it all

Lost motivation
We've all gone wrong

But I can't believe how they'd end this way
And look how they made us when things went wrong

It's alright
But I can't believe that it's over now
It's alright!
But I can't believe how they all fell down

Lost in confusion
We're lost in ourselves
To sort through the pieces we need them all

But I can't beleive how they'd end this way
And look how they made us when things went wrong

It's alright
But I can't believe that it's over now
It's alright
But I can't beleive how they all fell down

BREAK Right
I can't beleive that its over now,
It's Alright
I can't beleive how they all fell down
It's ALRIGHT
