Close your eyes...
And look at me
For I'm deep...
Deep in your memory

Visions...
Of a love we made
Then we were high...
High and her light did fade

Then we were high...
High and the light did fade

But it makes no difference
But it makes no difference
But it makes no difference what you think of me
Once again I'm free

Now it was come...
So let us take
Till the night...
Night that seem so quick

I remember
How I did the tell
The screams of love...
Love in my head
The screams of love...
Love in my head

But it makes no difference
But it makes no difference
But it makes no difference what you think of me
Once again I'm free

You act like...
We've never met before
There was a time...
Time you went back for more

Now I sing
What I've always known
That you will reap...
Reap what I've sown
That you will reap...
Reap what I've sown

But it makes no difference
But it makes no difference
But it makes no difference what you think of me
Once again I'm free

Freer than that
Freer than that
Freer than that
Freer than that
Freer than that
Freer than that
Freer than that
Freer than that
