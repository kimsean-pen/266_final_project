I can't outrun my fate
For years and far too late
So let me disappear
And drown away what's here
My final words are clear

Night falls, time is running out
This dream
Disposable machine
I've seen things that you would not believe
So let me fade away
Won't try to hide the pain
Moments lost in time like tears in rain

You're slipping from the edge
A reverie descends
Everyday's the same
The agony remains
Time and time again

Night falls and we're running out of time
Unconscious memories redefined
And I can't outrun my fate

This dream
Disposable machine
I've seen things that you would not believe
So let me fade away
Won't try to hide the pain
Moments lost in time like tears in rain
Tears in rain

Night falls and we're running out of time
Unconscious memories redefined
Night falls and we're running out of time
Unconscious memories redefined
Night falls and we're running out of time
Unconscious memories redefined

This dream
Disposable machine
I've seen things that you would not believe
So let me fade away
Won't try to hide the pain
Moments lost in time like tears in rain
Tears in rain (tears in rain)
Tears in rain
