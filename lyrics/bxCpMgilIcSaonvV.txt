gotta find a way to get home strong
gotta find a way back home

gotta find a light to guide me along
gotta find a way back home

running for your life won't get you so far
running for your life so far

gotta find a road to bring me home slow
gotta find a way back home

gotta find a road to bring me home slow
gotta find a way back home

the loving in your eye that holds you alive
gotta find a way back home

gotta find a way to get home strong
gotta find a way back home

gotta find a road that brings me back slow
gotta find a way back home

gotta find a way to get home strong
gotta find a way back home

saw you turning
big eyes burning on your way
nothing out there
the time to tell you what you own

never wanted to feel this pain
never wanted to feel so sad
never wanted to feel this pain
today
today

never wanted to feel this pain
never watned to feel so sad
never wanted to feel this way
today
today
today

never wanted to feel this way
never wanted to feel this pain

gotta find a way to get home strong
gotta find a way back home

gotta find a light to guide me along
gotta find a way back home

never wanted to feel this way
never wanted to feel this pain

gotta find a road that brings me back slow
gotta find a way back home

the loving in your eye that holds you alive
gotta find a way back home

gotta find a way to get home strong
gotta find a way back home

gotta find a road that brings me back slow
gotta find a way back home

gotta find a way to get home strong
gotta find a way back home
gotta find a way back home
gotta find a way back home
