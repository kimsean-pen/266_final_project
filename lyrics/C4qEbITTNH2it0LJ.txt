I lie here
staring up at the stratosphere
and hoping we're gonna get out of here

And it seems mad
that we're born on the doorstep
of squalor and of pedistools

And I lie here
surrounded by a range of general anaesthetics

To drowse the fact that funding insecurity
is not matched by spreading equality

(Now you hear us singing)
In the sunlight
where you caught us,
plotting the downfall of hoarders
In the sunlight where you caught us

(You hear them singing)
In the sunlight
where you caught us,
plotting the downfall of hoarders
In the sunlight where you caught us

It seems that every gap in the fence
we'll peak, we'll scratch, we'll stretch, we'll grab anything we can

And if we group together
and made a bigger whole
that just for our children's hands
but for bigger plans

Yeah if we group together
and made a whole
'cause I don't know about you but I've gotta get out of here

I've gotta get out of here
I've gotta get out of here

I've gotta get out of here
I've gotta get out of here
I've gotta get out of here
Woah

Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh

I've gotta get out of here
I've gotta get out of here
I've gotta get out of here

Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh

We will fall
so turbulently
accepting all the amnesty

(Trenching through tame
Dousing us for sane)?

And yes granted we prosper
but the fact that we prosper
is even taken for granted
