{Sometimes I can be my own worst enemy
I am my own worst enemy, other times when I'm alone at night
I definitely find myself in the position to be very unhappy with myself
This is one of those times
[Incomprehensible]}

Go go go

I stare into space and hope we're not alone
Am I searching for something that's better than home?
I've been working so hard

Stress is tremendous and pressure is endless
No one on this planet like me to be friends with
I've been working so hard, I've been working so hard

I'm underneath the sun, and I'm underneath the gun

I'm losing my mind and I know there's no remedy
Become a failure who's living on memories
I've been working so hard

Loneliness can't be cured with no medicine
Look to the stars so they'll straighten my head again
I've been working so hard, I've been working so hard

I'm underneath the sun, and I'm underneath the gun
I'm a fool to think the blame goes away
Such a fool to take the blame and run away

Yeah, I'm underneath the sun, and I'm underneath the gun
I'm a fool to think the blame goes away
Such a fool to take the blame and run away

Sometimes I beat up myself, I lock my own way
I cloud all my thoughts, please go away
Ohh, never mind please I'm checking out now
It won't ever come back, now that my life doesn't exist

Yeah, you're right, how does it feel to be right, knowing that I was wrong?
Nothing is right when you're wrong
Yeah, you're right, how does it feel to be right, knowing that I was wrong?
Nothing is right when you're wrong

Yeah, I'm underneath the sun, and I'm underneath the gun
I'm a fool to think the blame goes away
Such a fool to take the blame and run away
I'm a fool to think the blame goes away
Such a fool to take the blame
