We're celebrating
We're alive
We're all kids

Today we kill
There's no wives
We are whole once again
Tomorrow we die

You said we bring it to the party
We're out of line
So we bring it all right
And we're done playing games
All roads we stir up
They're all bedazzled all night

Come on maggots its a party
Tonight we not drink our own
Come on maggots its a party
It's time for death-disco-punk and rock 'n' roll

Now we're wasted
Trying to score
Stand still
We pitch nothing at all

We ain't trying what we got
What we want is a thrill
You know we want it all

She said I wanna know the bottle
So do I
No need to put up a fight
No need to twist my arm
I'm already fucked
I've still been drinking all night

Come on maggots its a party
Tonight we not drink our own
Come on maggots its a party
It's time for death-disco-punk and rock 'n' roll

Come on maggots its a party
Tonight we not drink our own
Come on maggots its a party
It's time for death-disco-punk and rock 'n' roll

Now here's some plans for the party
Let's stay alive
No intention to sleep

If you don't live free
You're not living at all
It's time to enjoy the insanity

Come on maggots its a party
Tonight we not drink our own
Come on maggots its a party
It's time for death-disco-punk and rock 'n' roll

Come on maggots its a party
Tonight we not drink our own
Come on maggots its a party
It's time for death-disco-punk and rock 'n' roll

Come on maggots its a party
Tonight we not drink our own
Come on maggots its a party
It's time for death-disco-punk and rock 'n' roll
