Prophecy was written in the pages of old
What will these words reveal
Locked away and hidden until the end of time
The only way to open is to break all the seals

Revelation tells us, weep not behold
For the lion of Judah prevails
Christ wins the fight with Satan, the devil
He alone can now open the book from the seals

Till the end of time as it was written
It's the end of the line, let it be done

This chapter will tell us of the crisis on earth
The beginning of a birth of a new age
First seal reveals false prophet will ride
The second seal leads us to war

Till the end of time as it was written
It's the end of the line, let it be done

The third seal will break let the famine begins
The pestilence comes from the fourth
As the rest of them break, you hear sounds from the heavens
Cries from the trumpets sound out

Till the end of time as it was written
It's the end of the line, let it be done

Step by step, the horseman will ride
Beware as false God deceives
Step by step when the white horse arrives
Christ wields his sword to the sky
Step by step by step, Christ comes wearing his crown

As the tales came to pass at the end of the world
The signs would come to be true
As a voice in the midst would speak of the beast
What was told will only bring death

As the tales came to pass at the end of the world
The signs would come to be true
As a voice in the midst would speak of the beast
What was told will only bring death

Till the end of time as it was written
It's the end of the line, let it be done

Step by step, the horseman will ride
Beware as false God deceives
Step by step when the white horse arrives
Christ wields his sword to the sky
Step by step by step, Christ comes wearing his crown
