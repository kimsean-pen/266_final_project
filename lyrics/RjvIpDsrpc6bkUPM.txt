Only for a second do they freeze
It's too easy to do it up here
Just a gentle push and you'd be over the edge
So they let you slip in and out of sight

There is no moon
There is no breeze
And this won't turn out
The way you please

This place has been crossed many times
Never was there cause for worry
But there's creatures living here now
Who pray on anything that moves

There is no moon
There is no breeze
And this won't turn out
The way you please

Stop and strain your ears
It's scarcely more than a whisper
Still the word is out

You shoot to attention
You shoot to attention
Recognition is immediate
Recognition is immediate
Answering is an instinctive reaction
Answering is an instinctive reaction

There is no moon
There is no breeze
And this won't turn out
The way you please

There is no moon
There is no breeze
And this won't turn out
The way you please

'Cause no matter what was said
You know you're dead
