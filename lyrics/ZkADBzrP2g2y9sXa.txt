As these old days rust
And new ones come
It's said and done
As these days fade away
And new ones sway
It's all been done
Falling towards gravity's end
As these days stay still
And some of them kill
It's said and done
This new dawn is callous
This time is not for us
Bring forth forever silent tongues
End of day, wake of dawn
This time it's not calling
Our numbers they are falling
Bring forth forever silent tongues
