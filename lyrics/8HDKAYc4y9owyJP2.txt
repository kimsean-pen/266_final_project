Heard you say you wanna die, so do I
Just do it like Nike, eat the night
Heard you said you wanna play, then it's Fisher Price
Your shoes faker than my smile, not surprised
Walk on water, Jesus Christ, walk on ice
I'm with Nino in BK, and we throwing bribes
With the kilo on a bike, bless the evil sky
DG number 9 but they blessed me twice

Drinking Drano like it's Faygo
I'm not tryna build with you, go play with Lego
In Morocco and I'm rolling out the Play-Doh
That's not a real drain shirt, that is a fake bro
At the swan lake, yeah I'm like a Ken doll
Got the trash pack, yeah that's essential
Futurama bleak, I'm going on a bender
Night knocking at the door are you gon' answer?
Night calling on my phone I will not answer

Evil money crying on it
GTB, they're spying on it
I can't even have a moment
Evil money crying on it
GTB, they're spying on it
I can't even have a moment
Fuck it, I switch up the dosage
If I go out sad that'd be a perfect ending
If I go out bad, would that make you happy?
If I go out sad that'd be the perfect ending
If I go out bad, would that make you happy?
If I go out sad that'd be the perfect ending
If I go out bad, would that make you happy?
It's bad, it's bad, it's bad
Why they copying the swag? I'm your dad
Drain Gang, we popping tags
It's bad, it's bad, it's bad
Why they copying the swag? I'm your dad
It's bad, it's bad, it's bad
Drain Gang, we popping tags
It's mad, it's mad, it's mad

Heard you say you wanna die, so do I
Just do it like Nike, eat the night
Heard you said you wanna play, then it's Fisher Price
Your shoes faker than my smile, not surprised
Walk on water, Jesus Christ, walk on ice
I'm with Nino in BK, and we throwing bribes
With the kilo on a bike, bless the evil sky
