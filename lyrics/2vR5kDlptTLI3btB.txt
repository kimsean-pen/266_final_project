Changes in the skyline
Running but I can't hide
Gotta find my way
And Imma be alright then
Stopping all the chasing
Starting by replacing
Everything that's wrong
And Imma be alright then

But in the mirror, it's not me who I see
To remember me being so weak
No, no
I don't know what to do
Guess I never knew
I need a moment for me
Me, myself and I, I

Now let me dream about the ocean
When the sun is, sun is rising in slow motion
(Before my eyes) Let me dream about the ocean
And Imma be, Imma be alright
Imma be my guy, in the night

(Uh, uh) Imma be alright
(Uh, uh) Na na
(Uh, uh) Imma be alright
Imma be alright
