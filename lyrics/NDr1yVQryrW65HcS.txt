I've lost my job today
But it's all the same
I'm more insane each day
But I'll be okay
But it's all in my head, in my head again
The things you said
But it's all in my head, in my head again
The things you said

I crashed my car today driving in the rain
I'm more insane each day
But I'll be okay
But it's all in my head, in my head again
The things you said
But it's all in my head, in my head again
The things you said

You don't know what you mean
To me, to me, to me

I lost my mind today standing in the rain
I'm more insane each day
But I'll be okay
But it's all in my head, in my head again
The things you said
But it's all in my head, in my head again
The things you said

You don't know what you mean
To me
You don't know what you mean
To me, to me, to me
