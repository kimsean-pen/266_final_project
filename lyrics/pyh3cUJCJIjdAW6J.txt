Drug me, infiltrate my never land
Like the floodtide drowning the shore

Drug me, you are all over me
Watch my blood begin to boil

I love that lullaby
Start me up again
Electric spine
Open mind

I leave you, negative behind
Watch me all in flames, on a butterfly I ride

Inhale the light
Relax for some time
The world outside stays numb tonight
Free your mind express the forgotten
The world inside is yours tonight

Please me, deliver the insane
In the chaos, I find peace

Please me, remind the gods of my name
I believe there is one seat left for me

I love that lullaby
Start me up again
Electric spine
Open mind

I leave you, negative behind
Watch me all in flames, on a butterfly I ride

Inhale the light
Relax for sometime
The world outside stays numb tonight
Free your mind express the forgotten
The world inside is yours tonight

I leave you, negative behind
Watch me all in flames, on a butterfly I ride

Inhale the light
Relax for sometime
The world outside stays numb tonight
Free your mind express the forgotten
The world inside is yours tonight
