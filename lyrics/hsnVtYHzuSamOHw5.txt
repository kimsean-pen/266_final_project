Standing in the open light
Within the swelter of the night
I found myself staring at you
And every time our fingers touched
I felt like it would be too much
And too little to hang on to

I cannot fall in love with you
I cannot feel this way so soon, so soon
I cannot be this way with you
I cannot fall in love with you

I knew it when you looked my way
That I'd be begging you to stay
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it to myself
I fought that burdened pain away
I held on when you moved away
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it
I couldn't just say it

And every evening, every time
I keep replaying in my mind
And wondering if you do the same
And if it makes you lose your breath
And if it makes you just forget
That all of it's a bit insane

I cannot fall in love with you
I cannot feel this way so soon
I cannot be this way with you
I cannot fall in love with you

I knew it when you looked my way
That I'd be begging you to stay
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it to myself
I fought that burdened pain away
I held on when you moved away
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it to myself
I knew it when you looked my way
That I'd be begging you to stay
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it to myself
I fought that burdened pain away
I held on when you moved away
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it to myself
I couldn't say it
I couldn't just say it

I cannot fall in love with you
I cannot feel this way so soon, so soon
I cannot be this way with you
I cannot fall in love with you
