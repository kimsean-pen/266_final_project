Well the first day of spring, well it came and gone
And the summer did too but winter's so long
And my heart still sings, sings for you
And I dream of the one summer night I spent with you

And it still goes on like the 4th of July
And my heart still beats like you're by my side
And I dream of the day when you'll be mine
And I'll fly sky high on the 4th of July

Well the first day of spring, well it came and gone
And the summer did too but winter's so long
And my heart still sings, sings for you
And I dream of the one summer night I spent with you

And then the rain came down and the shades of grey
And they washed our love, my dreams away
And the rising sun, it never came
It just stayed there in that one summer day

And it still goes on like the 4th of July
And my heart still beats like you're by my side
And I dream of the day when you'll be mine
And I'll fly sky high on the 4th of July

And the fireworks still pop in my head
The flag still flies overhead
And the banner still blows, still blow in the wind
The crowds still cheer, the crowds still sing

And it still goes on like the 4th of July
And my heart still beats like you're by my side
And I dream of the day when you'll be mine
And I'll fly sky high
And it still goes on like the 4th of July
And my heart still beats like you're by my side
And I dream of the day when you'll be mine
And I'll fly sky high, happy 4th of July
