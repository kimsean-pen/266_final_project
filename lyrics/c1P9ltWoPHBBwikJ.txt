An eye in the night appears as Something awakens
Into the silent sphere of Nothing created

Mother of time she breathes
Summons the autumn leaves
Turning the wheel of history
Constant Change is her name

Into the void I breathe
life as it swallows me
sinking into the hollow Tree
of Eternity
as winter buries her seed

Time - another inevitable lie
Taken in the undertow of life
We gravitate to annihilate
The coals of our fire

Circles of Life and seasons
Imprints of our achievements
Carved in the aether and in
The eyes of the one
Who brings the night and the dawn

Time - another inevitable price

Tides are my emotions
Water my tears and ice
Is time frozen
Stored in the memory of a sigh

Time - another
Inevitable price
Paid when the river of life
In our veins runs dry
The waking moments
That pass before our eyes
Are all we take to our graves.
