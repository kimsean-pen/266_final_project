C'mon yeah

I've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp

You've been living so long in hiding
In hiding behind that false mask

And you know and I know that
You ain't got long now to last

Your looks and your feelings
Are just the remains of your past

You're standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fall

Knowing the terror and holding
You have on us all

Yeah, I know that you're gonna
Scratch me and maim me and maul

You know I'm helpless
From your mesmerizing cat call

Uh

Keep your distance, walk away
Don't take his bait
Don't you stray
Don't fade away

Watch your step, he's out to get you
Come what may
Don't you stray
From the narrow way

Uh, uhh
I'm running and hiding in my dreams
You're always there

You're the phantom of the opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare

You damaged my mind and my soul
It just floats through the air

You haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair
