The rain falls around me, and from beyond a distant fog
The shadows that could render us asunder
The waves crash around me, pulling towards a deepest dark
I struggle just to keep from going under
It's all I can do

A dream world, a glory, a call from the depths of hell
I'm sickened by the terrible reminder
A fantasy, a fools' escape, a hopefulness, a sweet embrace
Illusions that this horror is behind us
It's all I can do

But I might fall to pieces
Might not pull through

A solid place, a secret want, a dream too dangerous to hold
Deny myself despite that I have found you
A shattered fist, a solid wall, continuously rise and fall
Ignore the dreadful thought that it's impossible to have it all
Impossible to have it all
Impossible to have it all
Impossible, impossible, impossible to have it all
