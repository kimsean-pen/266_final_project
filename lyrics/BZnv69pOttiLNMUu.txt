Maybe this time
I'll be lucky
Maybe this time
He'll stay

Maybe this time
For the first time
Love won't hurry away
He will hold me fast

I'll be home at last
Not a loser, huh,
Anymore like the last time
And the time before

Everybody

Loves a winner
So nobody loved me
Lady peaceful

Lady happy
That's what I long to be
All the odds are

They're in my favor
Something's bound to begin

It's gonna happen, haha
Happen sometime
Maybe this time I'll win
'Cause
Everybody
They love a winner
So nobody loved me
Lady peaceful
Lady happy
That's what I long to be
All of the odds are
They're in my favor
Something's bound to give in
It's gonna happen
Happen sometime
Maybe this time
Maybe this time I'll win
(I'll win)
Win!!!
