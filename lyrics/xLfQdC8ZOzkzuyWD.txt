From the corner of my eyes
To the back of my mind
I recognized what you mean to me
And all the corners of our picture
Are a long time fade, wasted,
Symbolize what you mean to me

You ask me to remember
A kiss is but a kiss
That I'd be a fool to want more from you

And I'm gone in a while
I'll be gone in a while
I'll be gone in a while
It's all that I do

I'll cry, and you'll cry, we'll cry
Till the rain pours black
Like every moon that's clinged to us
And thorough moment, there is beauty
Oh, it's not our simple yarn and mourn
Sometimes it feels that it's all I've got
It's all that's real

When I ask you to remember
A kiss is but a kiss
That I'd be a fool to want more from me

And I'm gone in a while
I'll be gone in a while
I'll be gone in a while
It's all that I do

From the corner of my eyes
To the back of my mind
I recognized what you mean to me
And all the waves and promises captured in a kiss
We hide and we seek, but each wonder if it's more
Something more than this

And I'm gone in a while
I'll be gone in a while
I'll be gone in a while
It's all that I do
It's all that I do
It's all that I do
It's all that I do
