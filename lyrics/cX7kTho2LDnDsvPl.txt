How you gonna get 'em back home
Are you gonna wear the same clothes
Touch upon a memory
A future that is evergreen
Does it feel wrong to you?
Doesn't feel right to me at all
Does it feel wrong to you?

How you gonna get 'em back home
Wish that it was covered in gold
Touch upon a merry street
In a future that is so unique

Does it feel wrong to you?
Doesn't feel right to me at all
Does it feel wrong to you?

Does it feel wrong to you?
Doesn't feel right to me at all
Does it feel wrong to you?

How you gonna get 'em back home
Are you gonna wear the same clothes
Touch upon a memory
In a future that is evergreen

Does it feel wrong to you?
Doesn't feel right to me at all
Does it feel wrong to you?

Does it feel wrong to you?
Doesn't feel right to me at all
Does it feel wrong to you?
