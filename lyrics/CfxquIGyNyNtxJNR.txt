I never was able to say
Just how I was feeling
Can we see the endless stake?
And this path I'm leaving

Do you really wanna know?
Do you really?

I feel lost
Feel boring
I've been caught
Sleeping all morning

Pull down the shades
Rather stay inside all day
My own thoughts are in my way
Rather sleep than have to stay

I feel lost
Feel boring
I've been caught
Sleeping all morning
I feel scared
Of knowing
I'm just a single leaf
In the wind blowing

Do you really wanna know?
Do you really wanna know?
Do you really wanna know?
Do you really?
