Look above into the misty air
I hear the waves reminding me of fear
I'm not alone but still I am confused
Will you return and will your dreams come true?

Across the sea into shallow water
Long ships' sails and sweeping oars
To walk the shores of a new land
To serve the shores of golden sand
Across the sea into shallow water
Long ships' sails and sweeping oars
To walk the shore of a new land
To serve the shores of golden sand

Farewell proud men
Spirits will guide you
May they save you
Farewell proud men

Frightening ocean sacred as the wind
I beg you please be careful with these men
At night I dream of wonders and of change
Will I receive a message from you then?

Across the sea into shallow water
Long ships' sails and sweeping oars
To walk the shores of a new land

To serve the shores of golden sand
Across the sea into shallow water
Long ships' sails and sweeping oars
To walk the shore of a new land
To serve the shores of golden sand

Farewell proud men
Spirits will guide you
May they save you
Farewell proud men

Far way from our own home
Show me a future
Open the palace door
And I will follow you

Farewell proud men
Spirits will guide you
May they save you
Farewell proud men

Farewell proud men
Spirits will guide you
May they save you
Farewell proud men
