I wanna give it up to
'Cause I was made for loving you

Do, do, do
Do, do, do

Tonight I wanna give it all to you
In the darkness there's so much I wanna do
And tonight I wanna lay it at your feet
'Cause boy, I was made for you
And boy, you were made for me

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

Tonight I wanna see it in your eyes
Feel the magic, there's something that drives me wild
And tonight we're gonna make it all come true
'Cause boy, I was made for you
And boy, you were made for me

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

Do, do, do
Do, do, do

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you
