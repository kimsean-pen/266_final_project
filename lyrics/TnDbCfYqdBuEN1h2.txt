So give me all you've got
I can take it
We walked alone in your city lights
Did you make it?
We lit the fire and it's burning bright

Did you take it?
Kissed all the boys in your city lights
Did you make it?
Left all the stars in your city nights
Can you fake it?
I lost my way in your city lights
glad you made it

We stole the fire

And it's burning bright
So give me all you've got
I can take it
We walked around in your city lights
'Cause it makes me who I am
We lit the fire
And it's burning bright

Not ashamed of what I am
I took the pills

for these empty nights
'Cause it makes me who I am
They always told me that
"You never get to heaven"
With a love like yours

Well if you're lost little boy
The cameras pull you right back down, yeah
It's like a chemical burn

I'm peeling off your skin, yeah
And when you see your face
Well you'll never be the same again, yeah

Cause if you just stop breathing
All stop, stop my heart
I'll stop breathing too
So give me all you've got
I can take it
We walked around in your city lights

'Cause it makes me who I am
We lit the fire
And it's burning bright
Not ashamed of what I am
I'd trade the world for your city nights

'Cause it makes me who I am
And it makes me who I am
And it makes me who I am
And though I missed the chance for this

I confess that I can't wait
Until it's gone
No I mean this every single day
dont go if you got more to say
'Cause the world don't need

Another hopeless cause
Though it makes me who I am
'Cause it makes me who I am
And you made me who I am
And you made me who I am
Be afraid of what I am
I can take it
We walked around in your city lights
'Cause it makes me who I am
i burned it all but im doing fine
'Cause I'll never fade away
if i steal the fight from your city nights
'Cause it makes me who I am
Who I am
