Two people, just meeting
Barely touching each other
Two spirits, greeting
Tryin'a carry it further

Two people, just meeting
Barely touching each other
They're two spirits, greeting
Tryin'a carry it further

'Cause you are
And I am another, oh ah
We should be, oh-ah
Inside eachother

You can see inside me
Will you come inside me
Do you wanna ride?

You can see inside me
Will you come inside me
Do you wanna ride?

You can see inside me
Will you come inside me
Do you wanna ride? (inside, inside)

You can see inside me
Will you come inside me
Do you wanna ride? (inside, inside)

Two strangers
Not strangers
Only lacking the knowing

So willing
Feeling
Infinite growing

'Cause you are
And I am another, oh-ah
We should be, wooaah
Inside each other

You can see inside me
Will you come inside me
Do you wanna ride? (inside, inside)

You can see inside me
Will you come inside me
Do you wanna ride? (inside, inside)

You can see inside me
Will you come inside me
Do you wanna ride? (inside, inside)

You can see inside me
Will you come inside me
Do you wanna ride? (inside, inside)

Inside my love (your love)
Inside my love (your love...)

Oh oh oh...

Baby (your love baby)

Inside my love
Inside my love

(You're love...)
Inside my love

Baby
