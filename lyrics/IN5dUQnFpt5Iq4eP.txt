The lights came on fast
Lost in motorcrash
Gone in a flash unreal
But you knew all along
You laugh the light
I sing the songs
To watch you numb

I saw you there
You were on your way
You held the rain
And for the first time, heaven seemed insane
'Cause heaven is to blame
For taking you away

Do you know the way that I can
Do you know the way that I can't lose?
Do you know the things that I can
Do you know the things that I can do?

Where is your heart?
Where is your heart gone to?
Tear me apart
Tear me apart from you

You laugh the light
I cry the wound
In gray afternoons

I saw you there
You were on your way
You kissed me cold
And for the first time, heaven seemed insane
For taking you away
'Cause heaven is to blame
For taking you away

The lights came to pass
Dead opera motorcrash
Gone in a flash unreal
In nitrous overcast

Do you know the way that I can
Do you know the way that I can't choose?
Do you know the things that I can
Do you know the things that I can't lose?

Tear me apart
Tear me apart from you
Where is your heart?
Where is your heart run to?
