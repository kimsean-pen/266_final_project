Rushing out the door at midnight
I found myself breathing fire
There's just one way to cure my heart from you
'Cause I can't let go, I'm still loving you so

Go run about the streets like it's a race
Go run about, run about
Oh, with the perfect plan you play with
What you can and run about

You think you've got it all set up now
This fever caught me in the rush
There's just one way to cure my heart from you
Because I can let go, I'm still loving you so

Go run about the streets like it's a race
Go run about, run about
Oh, with a perfect plan you play with
What you can, run about

Go run about the streets like it's a race
Go run about, run about
Oh, with a perfect plan you play with
What you can

Go run about the streets like it's a race
Go run about, run about
Oh, with a perfect plan you play with
What you can and run about, run about

Go run about the streets like it's a race
Go run about, run about
Oh, with a perfect plan you play with
What you can
