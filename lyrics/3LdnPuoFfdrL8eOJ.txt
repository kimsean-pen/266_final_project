You are the only one that my body loves
Trippin' me off the roof with my hands cuffed
You are the only one but it's not enough
Time won't you figure me out
Won't you fix me up

Run with the fire you gave me now it's game on
Tell me what it's like to love me
Tell me what went wrong
Lost in the way you crave me, how we carry on
Girl won't you keep me happy, won't you make me strong

Solo, back I go, back I go
So loco, left me wild on my own
I don't know how to want what I chose
I need us so, keep me sane, keep me close
I'm speaking so unstable but girl it's back on the table
Oh oh
What a show
What a show
Dreaming while I listen
Remember how you kiss, my body knows
Body knows

Haven't we lost it all so why you standin tall?
Couldn't bend your back to love me and you couldn't fall
How many fucking times did I try to call?
Kicking around for my pride like an animal

Solo, back I go, back I go
So loco, left me wild on my own
I don't know how to want what I chose
I need us so, keep me sane keep me close
I'm speaking so unstable but girl it's back on the table
Oh oh
What a show
What a show
Dreaming while I listen
Remember how you kiss, my body knows
Body knows

What's the best love in the world? My body love
Thank you for tripping me into my body love

I sit myself down and I separate us
(I've been gettin' to know my body love)
I sit myself down and I separate us

Solo, back I go, back I go
So loco, left me wild on my own
I don't know how to want what I chose
I need us so, keep me sane, keep me close

What's the best love in the world? My body love
Thank you for tripping me into my body love
What's the best love in the world? My body love
