I learnt how it is to feel alive
In dim chambers
A wet body, closeness
Warm thighs, tousled hair
Loving hands
Caring words.
Our footsteps in the snow
Faded

I know how it is to feel alive

Hollow wishes
Concrete souls.
Sensation o luminescence
Artificial and cold

The empty shining
Is my light.
The cold air in my lungs
Is my dirty warmth.
Someone is the scape.
You were mine.
