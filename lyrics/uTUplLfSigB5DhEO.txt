You were right, babe.
None of this means anything.
There's so much more for us to be,
And see.
Somehow all of the sudden
I find myself struggling,
To lie...
Far too much but not enough.
I concede this childish need for attention.
The desperate act.
A disappearing man.
Better catch him while you can.

What a mess.
Past and present stitched together,
Perilously tethered.
I ain't fooling anyone,
Least of all me.
Calling in sick forever.
And I'm calling bullshit on everyone.
This is a test.
And I'm failing it.

You were right, babe.
I love how you know me.
I know how you love me.
I know how you long for this songs end.
