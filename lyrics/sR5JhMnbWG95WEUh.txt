The sun comes up and five years gone
Life goes on, life goes on
I wonder how you're gettin' by
The sun goes down and I feel blue
Now I toss 'cause my minds on you
I kind of miss your broken smile

Save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me

I remember you and me
Lost and young dumb and free
Unaware of years to come
Just a whisper in the dark
On the pavement in the park
You taught me how to love someone

When we walk into the sun
Or burn below for what we've done
Will you still call out for me
Turn to light or fade to black
Don't look back, no you don't look back
I will always remember you

The sun came up and five years gone
Life goes on, yes life goes on
I hope you caught up with your dreams
I hope you saved part of yourself
for me
