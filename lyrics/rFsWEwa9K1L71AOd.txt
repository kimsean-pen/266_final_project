I need a holiday
I been goin' hard like there's somethin' wrong with me
Book a flight for Miami-dade
I'll lay around by the beach naked
Sip on my favorite thing
Oooo somebody come do a back massage for me
Sunshine
Water rippling
It's what I need is a holiday

(Yeah)
I've been moving like a train all week
All this chuggin' took a toll on me
I put the Hennessy bag in the freezer
I could use like a ten day breather
Freakin' out but it ain't that deep
A couple people tried to fuck with me
Wishin they would get struck by lighting

Lost my zen and I need to find it
(I, I, I Need to find it) (On an island)
I might get lost in the groove
Put on my grass skirt and hula,
like a buddha
Hallelujah
All trouble gone with the breeze
Sing it with me if you agree

I need a holiday
I been goin' hard like there's somethin' wrong with me
Book a flight for Miami-dade
I'll lay around by the beach naked
Sip on my favorite thing
Oooo somebody come do a back massage for me
Sunshine
Water rippling
It's what I need is a holiday

My sanity called
Said I had identity fraud
Said I should cancel all my plans
And I mail you a card
Only I don't know when I can get out of the city (aye)
I got no fucks to give
You know I've been too fucking busy (oh)
I want to roll up in the sand
Catch a wave and get a tan
Fall asleep
Wake up
And do it all again
Pick my battle now I need to fight it

Lost my zen and I need to find it
(I, I, I need to find it) (On a island)
I might get lost in the groove
Put on my grass skirt and hula,
Like a buddha
Hallelujah
All trouble gone with the breeze
Sing it with me if you agree

I need a holiday
I been going hard like is something wrong with me
Book a flight for Miami-Dade
I'll lay around by the beach naked
Sip on my favorite thing
(Ooooo) Somebody come do a back massage for me

Give me one give me on of them baby

I need a holiday
I've been goin' hard like there's something wrong with me
