We can never know about the days to come
but we think about them anyway.
And I wonder if I'm really with you now
or just chasing after some finer day

Anticipation, anticipation
is making me late
is keeping me waiting

And I tell you how easy it feels to be with you
and how right your arms feel around me.
But I rehearsed those words just late last night
when I was thinking about how right tonight might be.

Anticipation, Anticipation
is making me late
is keeping me waiting

And tomorrow we might not be together
I'm no prophet, i don't know nature's ways.
So I'll try and see into your eyes right now
and stay right here, 'cause these are the good old days.
