I can wait
I can wait
I can sit wondering what in world you think about
I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out
After all the alcohol, the pretty words that devolve down
To slurs and drunken shouts
I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out
It's like some wild last frontier
You never know what kind of fight's gonna appear
That once begun can't be won
Started out losing already and go all ten rounds
I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out
The tired hits that fall below
I can't connect, yeah yeah i know
I can wait
I can wait
I can sit wondering what in the world you think about
I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out
I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out
I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out
