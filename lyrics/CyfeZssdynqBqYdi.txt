One to hundred multiplied by you
It all looks great, it all looks cool

Healthy children go to school
My daughter's in love, my son loves too

Oh on the surface, oh in the distance
It's all the same.
Oh, in the darkness, oh don't you notice
What a different game yeaah

If you take this life from me today
Tare it up and bury me away

For just one two . three songs of mine,
Hundred worries of mine
Your love, your love in rewind.

For just one two . three songs of mine,
hundred worries of mine
And love, love in rewind

(whoaaa ooooh)

One to hundred multiplied by two
Just like me, it's less about you.
To keep it running on serpentine
I don't know where to run from reality yeaaah

If you take this life from me today
Tare it up and bury me away.

For just one two ... three songs of mine,
Hundred worries of mine
Your love, your love in rewind.

For just one two . three songs of mine,
Hundred worries of mine
Your love, your love in rewind
