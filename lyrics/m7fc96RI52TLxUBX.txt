See, see how she dances
With that cigarette in her hand
And she, she romances
Everybody like she can

She, brings the light
It catches me, again

Life, I've seen some wonders
I played my stupid games with you
Sing to me like I know you can
But girl would I be

She knits a snare
Catches me, again

I guess, you know
To keep on, dancin'
Like I know you can

We're gonna make it through
We're gonna make it through now
'Cos we're gonna make it through
'Cos we're gonna make it through now

And the circus leave this town

We're gonna make it through
I said, we're gonna make it through now
Yeah, we're gonna make it through
I said, we're gonna make it through now

And the boys with their dreams
For the boys and their dreams
I know you can hear me
