It's slow here without the wind down town
The push has gone that hounds my side
It's quiet too, bless me this shrine
That the moments that you treasure aren't set aside
What's lost is here, it's charged it feels

I can't settle, I can't rest
I can't settle, I can't rest
I did settle in a ravens nest
