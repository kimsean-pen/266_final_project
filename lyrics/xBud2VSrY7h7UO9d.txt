Baby's having such fun
Baby thinks he's the one
One and only exception
He'll go down the rest of them

April comes for one more May
The floor is swept, the clothes are put away
That's a day

Have you heard news?
Baby had to choose
Now he's on the wall
Can you make a judgement call?

April comes for one more May
The floor is swept, the clothes are put away
And that's a day
