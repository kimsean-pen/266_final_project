In a negative space, I wanna leave it
Turn around right as you're leaving
The cruel mistake, I can't believe it
You can't trust now that you're not breathing
A pain that's no savior, a pain that's not ours
I get it though, I get it though
They're waiting on a troubled brow
And it's lasted, oh, it's lasted
And if they're really watching this thing
Watch and not reacted
My gut sinks slow, my gut sinks slow
I sat in here for hours while I've thrown away you wrote
I cried in here for hours while I looked at what you wrote
Stop checking through the hour from the last time that we spoke
My gut sinks slow, my gut sinks slow
And if we're really doing this and you're sure it's not a joke
How long's forever?
How long's forever?

All I thought to ask for, but now I'll never know
If you hope for better futures, let's just try to keep on going
And your body is for lasting, yeah it's lasting
I'm sure it used to make you laugh but
Now you don't react to it
My gut sinks slow, my gut sinks slow
I sat in there for hours trying to show you what I wrote
I waited here for hours just in case I hit the spot
My father waited for hours just to hear me play a note
How long's forever?
How long's forever?
How long's forever?
How long's forever?

And I still see you every time I'm down
My television's cruelest blunder
I still hear you every time I'm down
Laughing like you won't fall under
In a negative space, I wanna leave it
I turn around as you're turning
In a negative space, I wanna leave it
You're out we're out, if you're not returning
In a negative space, I can't believe it
I'm turning round right as you're turning
In a negative space, I wanna leave it
You're out we're out, if you're not returning

I still see you every time I'm down
I still hear you every time I'm down
I still see you every time I'm down
I still hear you every time I'm down
I still see you every time I'm down
I still hear you every time I'm down
I still see you every time I'm down
