Yes, I'm a Yugoslav, indeed a Swede.
Got two brothers, girlfriend, dad and mom.
Good boxershorts I need, lots of maps I read.
I would love to run my own farm.

I like the Beatles, funk and punk.
I watch hockey, basketball, play chess.
I eat veggie-junk and I love Superchunk.
To boule and travel I say yes.

All this I adore, at the same time it's just me.
It's what I care for, it's what I want to be.

I want it all, I want it all to stay right here.
I want it all to be a part of Slick Nick's sphere.
I want it all to be sincere where ever I go.

Lisa, Madonna are girls who knows where it's at
and Dr. Kris is a favorite rocker.
My main star is Miat, we have a car, a Fiat.
Yeah, still my dearest sport is soccer.

I'm not an ace on bass, it's what I face.
But yeah, I think it's king to sing.
Sailingboats I chase, I'd like to go into space.
Riding my silverfox is the real thing.

All this I adore, at the same time it's just me.
It's what I care for, it's what I want to be.

I want it all, I want it all to stay right here.
I want it all to be a part of Slick Nick's sphere.
I want it all to be sincere where ever I go.
Where ever I go, Where ever I go, Where ever I go
All around the world I go, Pennybridge, Belgrade and even T.O.

I want it all, I want it all to stay right here.
I want it all to be a part of Slick Nick's sphere.
I want it all, I want it all,
I want it all, I want it all to stay right here.
To be a part of Slick Nick's sphere.
I want it all to be sincere where ever I go.
