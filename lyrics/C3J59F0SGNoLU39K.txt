No need to translate
'Cause my eyes give me away
Even though my lips don't say

This should be so easy
But my head gets in the way
All the things that I want to tell you

You're the most perfect yet
Most definitely that I've met
And I wonder if you know that's how I feel
About you
I hope you know

'Cause I have so much love
For you
Do with it what you will
And I have nothing more
To prove
Say to me what you will
Say
Say it again

Not enough lovers in life to go around
But there's you and me
If we don't start it out
It's not hard to let go
Enough to let me in
If it's meant to be
It can only be good

You're the most perfect fit
Most definitely that I've met
And I hope that you feel the same way too
About me
Just let me know

'Cause I have so much love
For you
Do with it what you will
And I have nothing more
To prove
Say to me what you will
Say
Say it again

(Can you take it?)
Can you take it from me?
(Can you take it?)
If I give can you receive?
(Can you take it?)
Oh oh
(Can you take it?)
I'm reaching out
(Can you take it?)
Giving everything
(Can you take it?)
I give you my heart
I give you my soul
I give you it all

'Cause I have so much love
For you
Do with it what you will
And I have nothing more
To prove
Say to me what you will
Say
Say it again

'Cause I have so much love
For you
Do with it what you will
And I have nothing more
To prove
Say to me what you will
Say
Say it again
