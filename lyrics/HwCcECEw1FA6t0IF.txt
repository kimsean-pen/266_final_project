A world lies dormant
Deep inside the seed,
A slumbering desire,
Seeking inner light,
Forgetting outer dark

And lo she resis
On a path empyreal,
Breaking down het own walls,
From the soil of hoary earth
To the realm sidereal

With spirit unfettered
She leaves her shell ephemeral,
And the mortal coil behind,
In the depth of the world
Beneath perpetual skies

The inner gate opens
Beyond the fraying veil,
And the light reborns
From the infertile dark,
Revealing the arcane
