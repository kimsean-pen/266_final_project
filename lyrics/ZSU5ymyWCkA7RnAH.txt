Something's got a hold of my head
And it won't leave me alone
Neon when you come on

Something's got a hold of my head
And it won't let me go
Neon when you come on

Something's got a hold of my head
And no I didn't know
Neon when you come on

Something's got a hold of my head
And I didn't know
Yeah and when you come on
(And you) Come on

And it brings a new type of grace
And I keep coming back for more
And it leaves me with a shimmering face
And I keep coming back
For more

And it brings a new type of grace
And I keep coming back for more
And it leaves me with a shimmering face
And I keep coming back
For more

Neon when you come and go
Neon when you come and go
Neon when you come and go
Neon when you come and go
Neon when you come and go
Neon when you come and go

(Neon) And it brings a new type of grace
And I keep coming back for more
(Neon) And it leaves me with a shimmering face
And I keep coming right back
For more
