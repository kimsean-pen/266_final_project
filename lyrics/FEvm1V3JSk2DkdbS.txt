You breathing makes me hate you
Him watching makes me cry
Why do I care
Wasting thoughts I'd rather die
You breathing makes me hate you
Him watching makes me cry
Why do I care
Wasting thoughts I'd rather die

You breathing makes me hate you
Him watching makes me cry
Why do I care
Wasting thoughts I'd rather die
You breathing makes me hate you
Him watching makes me cry
Why do I care
Wasting thoughts I'd rather die

Take it somewhere out of sight

Don't let me see him touch you
Take it somewhere outta sight
I don't need to see he loves you
My imaginations right
Don't let me see him touch you
Take it somewhere outta sight
I don't need to see he loves you
My imaginations right
I just don't really like you
I can't explain why
It's not just what you say
I just don't really like you
I can't explain why
It's not just what you say
I just don't really like you
I can't explain why
It's not just what you say

I just don't really like you
In any kind of way

(S-H) Why?
