Nothing seems to be the way that it used to
Everything seems shallow, God give me truth, in me
And tell me somebody's watching over me
And that is all I'm praying's that

Someday I will understand in God's own plan
And what he's done to me
Oh, but maybe someday I will breathe
And I'll finally see, I'll see it all in my baby

Don't you run too fast my dear, why don't you stop?
Just stop and listen to your tears they're all you've got
It's in you, you see somebody's watching over you
And that is all I'm praying's that

Someday you will understand in God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh, but maybe someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see, you'll see it all in your baby

You'll see it all in your baby
No moment, will be more true
Then the moment I look at you
It's in you, you see somebody's watching over you

And that is all I'm praying's that
Someday you will understand in God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh, but maybe someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see, you'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby, you'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby
