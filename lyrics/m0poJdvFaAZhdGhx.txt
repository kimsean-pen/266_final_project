Winter days, turn to grey
Put the headlights on
Snow and rain, wiped away
I can't keep my eyes on the road
When I'm driving home
I got tears running down, burning in my eyes
And you & I, heated by the flicker of a lighter
Oh, and I let it go

But I just got here
I know it's been a while darling, dear
There's been a change in the time of year
When the frost bites the snow
And Christmas comes around

For the down and outs
And broken lay-abouts
What will they do now?
When the Christmas comes around
We were so in love
Till I messed it up
But who will love me now?
When Christmas comes around

Family asking me why I let you go
Telling me it's a mistake
I'm telling them that I know
But I can't call you
Your inner space, better place
Loving on a new man
I don't blame you at all
You did all that you can, I know
But I just got here
I know it's been a while darling, dear
There's been a change in the time of year
When the frost bites the snow
And Christmas comes around
For the down and outs
And broken lay-abouts
What will they do now?
When Christmas comes around

We were so in love
Till I messed it up
But who will love me now?
When Christmas comes around
And I'm sick of all the songs
The Christmas sing alongs
The merry and the cheer
Cause I don't feel like that this year
All the bells are all the same
And my soul is on the brink
So I'll help myself a drink
And sing

When Christmas comes around
For the down and outs
And broken lay-abouts
What will they do now?
When Christmas comes around
We were so in love
Till I messed it up
But who will love me now?
When Christmas comes around
Who will love me now?
When Christmas comes around
