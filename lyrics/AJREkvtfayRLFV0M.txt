Evanescent like the scent of decay
I was fading from the race
When in despair, my darkest days ran amok and forged her face
From the fairest of handmaidens to a slick perverted wraith

Nymphetamine

Heaving midst narcissus on a maledict blanket of stars
She was all three wishes
Sex, sex, sex
A lover hung on her deathrow, I was hooked on her disease
Highly strung like Cupid's bow whose arrows hungered meat
And the blinding flare of passion
In the shade of narrow streets
Where their poison never rationed, all the tips they left in me

Two tracks
Bric-a-brac
Something passed between us like a bad crack
Upward-lit I'd met another kind
Of rat
In fact with every Rome inside me licked and ransacked
She haunted at the corners of my mind
In black
Cataracts
Wouldn't whitewash away her filthy smoke stack
She burnt me like a furnace
For my future suicide

Lead to the river
Midsummer, I waved
A V of black swans on with hope to the grave
All through Red September
With skies fire-paved
I begged you appear like a thorn for the holy ones
Cold was my soul, untold was the pain
I faced when you left me a rose in the rain
So I swore to the razor
That never enchained would your dark nails of faith
Be pushed through my veins again

Bared on your tomb I'm a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever soon come above unto me?
For once upon a time from the binds of your lowliness
I could always find the right slot for your sacred key

Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart, that barless prison
Discolours all with tunnel vision
Sunsetter
Nymphetamine
Sick and weak from my condition
This lust, this vampyric addiction
To her alone in full submission
None better
Nymphetamine
Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
Nymphetamine girl
Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
My nymphetamine girl

Wracked with your charm I am circled like prey
Back in the forest where whispers persuade
More sugar trails more white lady laid
Than pillars of salt

Fold to my arms hold their mesmeric sway
And dance out to the moon as we did in those golden days
Christening stars I remember the way
We were needle and spoon mislaid in the burning hay

Bared on your tomb I'm a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever soon come above unto me?
For once upon a time from the bind of your holiness
I could always find the right slot for your sacred key

Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart, that barless prison
Discolours all with tunnel vision
Sunsetter
Nymphetamine
Sick and weak from my condition
This lust, this vampyric addiction
To her alone in full submission
None better
Nymphetamine

Sunsetter
Nymphetamine (nymphetamine)
None better
Nymphetamine

Two tracks
