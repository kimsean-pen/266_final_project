Recall
The earth-shattering exchange
What did you gain
And what was lost, what was lost?

Forget what they say
Step into the ancient world
Where blood meets the sea
And stale limbs hang off the old

In the mirror there's a shimmer of a ghost trying to awake
I've been trying so hard to make no big mistakes
Higher states, now we resonate
Bodies slipping into place
If this is still the same cage
Then take me far away

When was
The last time you spread your wings
And flew towards the closest blonde
To fall from grace, fall from grace?

Forget what they say
Step into the ancient world
Where blood meets the sea
When faith was free instead of sold

In the mirror there's a shimmer of a ghost trying to awake
I've been trying so hard to make no big mistakes
Higher states, now we resonate
Bodies slipping into place
If this is still the same cage
Then take me far away

In the mirror there's a shimmer of a ghost trying to awake
I've been trying so hard to make no big mistakes
Higher states, now we resonate,
Bodies slipping into place
If this is still the same cage
Then take me far away
