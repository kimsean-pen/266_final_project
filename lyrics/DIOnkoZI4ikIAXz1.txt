Voicemail is full
Glass is half empty
I want you bad
I want it that bad
I get what I want
But maybe I shouldn't
'Cause that would be bad
That would be so bad

One, two, three, four, five
Too many times
I've been down this road too many nights
So next time

I should use my heart
I should use my heart
I should use my heart less
Use my heart
I should use my heart
I should use my heart less, no

So I kiss you goodbye
Maybe I shouldn't, not when it's good
Not when it's this good
And I never learn
So maybe it's my fault
I always love
I love you too hard

One, two, three, four, five
Too many times
I've been down this road too many nights
So next time

I should use my heart
I should use my heart
I should use my heart less
Use my heart
I should use my heart
I should use my heart less, no
(I should use my heart less)

Voicemail is full
Glass is half empty
I want you bad
I want it that bad

I should use my heart
I should use my heart
I should use my heart less
Use my heart
I should use my heart
I should use my heart less, no
(I should use my heart less)
