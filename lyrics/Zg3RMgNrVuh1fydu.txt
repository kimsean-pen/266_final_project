Aaa-eee-yeah
Aaa-eee-oooh

In the mornings,
I was anxious
Was better just to stay in bed
Didn't wanna fail myself again

Running through all the options
And the endings
Were rolling out in front of me
But I couldn't choose a thread to begin
And I could not, love
Cos I could not love myself
Never good enough no
That was all id tell myself
And I was not well
But I could not help myself
I was giving up on living

Aaa-eee-yeah
Aaa-eee-oooh

In the morning
You were leaving
Travelling inside the gate
And you said you were not unprepared
And all the dead ends
Disappointments
Fading from your memory
Ready for that lonely life to end

And you gave me love
When I could not love myself
And you made me turn
From the way I saw myself
And your patient love
And you helped me help myself
And you save me
And you save me
And you save me

Aaa-eee-yeah
Aaa-eee-oooh
