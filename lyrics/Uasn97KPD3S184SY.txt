Meet me down by the old oak tree
Where you can be you and I will be me
Forget everything that once was said
Dry your eyes and rest your head
Remember a time when we used to smile

I ...
Hear you crying in your sleep
Fighting demons that I can not reach
Wish I could kiss your fears away
Just believe me baby
They will fade away
They will fade away
They will fade away

Hear you crying in your sleep
Fighting demons that I can not reach
Wish I could kiss your fears away
Just believe me baby
They will fade away
They will fade away
They will fade away
They will fade away
