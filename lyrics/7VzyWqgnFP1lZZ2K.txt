I am free!
I can't believe chains are broke
Tradition we delete
A human in the fortress
I wiggle to the bed
(If only it were true, if only)
Careful now!
Tails will be caught if you keep on your toes
I am a monster, and
I'm looking for a break
(If only it were true, if only)
There's no names here
Come follow me
Together we are drastic in our voyage to proceed
(If only it were true, if only)
