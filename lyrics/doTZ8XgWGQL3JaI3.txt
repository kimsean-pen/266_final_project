Move it like an Alabama rabbit
Now hear this

I'm a fool
I'm a fool
Yet you still love me
Say what you do
What it do
With a girl gone bad
Don't wanna play
Wanna play
Might get real ugly
And it won't hurt
Cross my heart and hope to die

Now won't you say, say, say
That you love me
And I'll come back
Chopping up that life
Oh won't you say, say, say
You still want me
You've got to tell me
If you want me tonight

Hey now, all you got to believe in
I gotta leave this town
Leave this town behind

Hey now, I don't really care
What they say now
I gotta wreck this town
Wreck this town tonight

I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
And it goes both ways
Do you get me
Unafraid of the things that
You tell me I can't do
So won't you say, say, say
If you want me
You've gotta tell me
If you're with me tonight

Hey now, all you got to believe in
I gotta leave this town
Leave this town behind

Hey now, I don't really care
What they say now
I gotta wreck this town
Wreck this town tonight

Hey won't you get down

Now hear this

It's gonna get high
Gonna get low
It's gonna get lonely
You gotta get
Outta my head
Outta my mind
Feel like I'm scared of falling

Isn't this strange
Where do I go
Still undecided
And it's time to run for cover
And you know I'm all that you need

Hey now, all you got to believe in
Gotta leave this town
Leave this town behind

Hey now, I don't really care
What they say now
I gotta wreck this town
Wreck this town tonight

Hey now, all you got to believe in
I gotta leave this town
Leave this town behind (ah ha)

Hey now, I don't really care
What they say now
I gotta wreck this town
Wreck this town
Wreck this town
Wreck this town tonight

When music is nice
You gotta do it twice

Hey now, all you got to believe in
I gotta leave this town
Leave this town behind (ah ha)

Hey now, I don't really care
What they say now
I gotta wreck this town
Wreck this town
Wreck this tonight

Now brothers and sisters you
Gotta be cool in the neighborhood
You know
