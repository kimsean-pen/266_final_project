Fools in love
Well are there any other kind of lovers
Fools in love
Is there any other kind of pain
Everything you do
Everywhere you go now
Everything you touch

Everything you feel
Everything you see
Everything you know now
Everything you do
You do it for your lady love
Your lady love
Your lady love
Your lady love

Fools in love
Are there any creatures more pathetic
Fools in love
Never knowing when they've lost the game

Everything you do
Everywhere you go now
Everything you touch
Everything you feel
Everything you see
Everything you know now
Everything you do

You do it for your lady love
Your lady love
Your lady love
Your lady love

Fools in love
They think they're heroes
'Cause they get to feel more pain
I say fools in love are zeros
I should know
I should know because this fool's in love again

Fools in love
Gently hold each other's hands forever
Fools in love
Gently tear each other limb from limb
Everything you do
Everywhere you go now
Everything you touch
Everything you feel
Everything you do
Even your rock 'n' roll now
Nothing mean a thing except you and your lady love
Your lady love
Your lady love
Your lady love

Fools in love
They think they're heroes
'Cause they get to feel more pain
I say fools in love are zeros
I should know
I should know because this fool's in love again

Fools in love
They think they're heroes
'Cause they get to feel more pain
I say fools in love are zeros
I should know
I should know because this fool's in love again
