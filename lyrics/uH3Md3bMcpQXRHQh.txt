I found the fragance separate from the flower
In all the logic I was lost
I found the fair light blossom to be sour
And beneath the soil, the real cost

You came to me
Carelessly
I am iris and the lense
The bridge adjusting to the water
water, water, water
The level inside will rise
A fallen monument lies

A prism is only walls
My arms will not be bars
The well now is your supportIn autosuggested pathways
you are caught
