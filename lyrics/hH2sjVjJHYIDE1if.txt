Mind is elastic, feeling the stretch When I flex it, exit my brain
Somehow
It's real lucid
I'll lose it
Who said it's a drink in my head
Up in the clouds

Flowing fast
Kicking dust
Starting fires

Throwing bones
Riding low
Not inspired
'til I get my dose of dopamine

My dose of...
My dose of...
'til I get my dose of dopamine
My dose of...
My dose of...

Sick with the habit
Falling with visions and patterns
Grabbing the floor
To throw me out
Mix with the static
I stop and strut like the traffic
To suck it up or push it down

Flowing fast
Kicking dust
Starting fires

Throwing bones
Riding low
Not inspired

I'm hanging in between the lines
I'm hanging 'til I feel
I'm hanging in between the lines
I'm hanging 'til it's real

My dose of...
My dose of...
'til I get my dose of dopamine
My dose of...
My dose of...

'til I get my dose of dopamine
'til I get my dose of dopamine
