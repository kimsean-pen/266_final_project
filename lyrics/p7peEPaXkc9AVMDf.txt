Sometimes I get much closer than I intend
The other time I just like to sit out on the fence
Most times I can't even tell the difference
Partially a ghost
Don't you get too close
I love you way more than you know
I'm partially a ghost
We tried to get back to the way it was back then
It is the best thing to do and trouble ends
But then why did the world make me what I am within?
I'm partially a ghost
Don't you get too close
I love you way more than you know
I'm partially a ghost
Change my life just upon a whim
Jump into the ocean learn to swim
Come to summer, winter, all and the seasons I guess that might be the reason That I'm a ghost
I'm partially a ghost
I love you more than you know
That's why I'm a ghost
