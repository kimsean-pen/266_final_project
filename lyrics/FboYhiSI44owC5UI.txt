Your yelling's getting loud
Keep it down now
Keep it down now
There's talk going 'round this town
Keep it down now
Keep it down now
Noises closing in on all sides
Warning all the ways to die
They say
"You'd better give up
You'd better give up."
I'll be an army, no you're
Not gonna stop me getting
Through
I'll sing a marching song and
Stomp through the halls louder than
You
I could surrender but I'd
Just be pretending, no I'd
Rather be dead than live a lie
Burn the white flag
Burn the white flag
