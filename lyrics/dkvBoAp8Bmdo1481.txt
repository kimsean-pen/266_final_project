Like passing city lights
I watch these days go by
Moving all too fast
For me to comprehend

Paralyzed like a fly in a cobweb
All my motions oppressed
No chance of survival
No harbour from this storm

Day or night it makes no difference
I'm enslaved by my own mind
It's Forcing me to watch
It is forcing me to sleep

Oh hello
Do I know you?
Don't mind me
I'm just a stranger
What caught your attention?
What are your intentions?
You got way too close
Drew me from my hideout
You broke down all of my barricades
The light in your eyes
Reconnects me to a real life
So is there a chance for me to change
Or is everything already set in stone?
Can I follow my own aspirations and
Take back control?
I need a soul

See I'm not a cold machine
There's no simple solution
To be honest I cannot define myself
Please take my hand and turn me into to a better man

I've had my head in the clouds for too long
I've had enough shed my doubts cause I'm
Back in control again

I'm so tired of this self destruction
Of this endless fight against myself
All will fall into place
Once we lift this curse
