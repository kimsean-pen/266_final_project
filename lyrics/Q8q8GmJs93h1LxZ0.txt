I've been sleeping around the week
And I think your starting to get to me
I don't, I don't want to be one of those guys
But it's the only way i get to feel something
I need a distraction,
something to happen, need to stop actin like I'm okay
Cause I'm not
I want to feel human,
but I just feel stupid and this is
confusing but I'm not okay, no I'm not
If you ask me how I'm doing I say fine
If you ask me how I'm doing I say I'm alright,
I'm afrad of being honest cause my honesty ain't nice
If you ask me how I'm doing I say fine fine
Fine
Fine
If you ask me how I'm doing I say fine fine
I've been making bad excuses To hide from the way that the truth is
it's like I'm not happy with myself
and now I'm to ashamed to ask for help
If you ask me how I'm doing I say fine
If you ask me how I'm doing I say I'm alright
I'm afraid of being honest cause my honesty ain't nice
If you ask me how I'm doing I say fine fine
Fine
Fine
If you ask me how I'm doing I say fine fine
I need a distraction,
something to happen, cause I'm not okay, no I'm not
I want to feel human but I just feel stupid and
this is confusing but I'm not okay i know I'm not
If you ask me how I'm doing I say fine
If you ask me how I'm doing I say I'm alright
I'm afraid of being honest cause my honesty ain't nice
If you ask me how I'm doing I say fine fine
Ohhhhhhh
If you ask me how I'm doing I say fine fine
