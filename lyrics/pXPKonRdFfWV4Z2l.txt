Common place names things
Seem to have great significance

Hi

Turn around your life will change
Without your consent, without your okay
It happened again
I woke up today and everything changed

All my friends and all my family
Suddenly they don't understand me
Understand
I'm not the man they think I am

Try chasing it down, try chasing it down
Try chasing it down
It don't wanna be found, it don't wanna be found
It don't wanna be found

Favorite day of a favorite waitress
Favorite place, it's Southern Frames
It's up for sale, it doesn't matter any how

Like anything that tasted sweet
It only taste that way about a week
Before [Incomprehensible] bittersweet

Try chasing it down, try chasing it down
Try chasing it down
It don't wanna be found, it don't wanna be found
It don't wanna be found

Abigail oh, play Miguel
You had a name that said itself
But funny how a name can change
About the time you find you're sick of
Sayin' it, sayin' it, sayin' it, sayin' it

[Incomprehensible]
Took every left part of me
But funny, once you're in to it
We are encompassing, being just a
Part of it, part of it, part of it, part of it

Try to get back there, try to get back there
Try to get back there, try to get back there
It's a one shot deal, one shot deal
It's a one shot deal

Turn around your life will change
Without your consent, without your okay

All my friends and all my family
Suddenly they don't understand me
Understand
I'm not the man they think I am

Oh, let it go
Oh, let it go
Oh, let it go
Oh

Oh
Try chasing it down, try chasing it down
Try chasing it down, try chasing it down
It don't wanna be found, it don't wanna be found
It don't wanna be found, it don't wanna be found

Try to get back there, try to get back there
Try to get back there, try to get back there
