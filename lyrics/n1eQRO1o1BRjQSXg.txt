Oh, oh, oh
It's magic!
You know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic!
You know
Never believe it's not so!

I've never been awake
I've never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning.
A lazy day in bed, music in my head
Crazy music playing in the morning
Light!

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic!
You know
Never believe it's not so!
It's magic!
You know
Never believe it's not so!

I love a sunny day
A dream of far away
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning.
I've never been awake
I've never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning
Light!

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic!
You know
Never believe it's not so!
It's magic!
You know
Never believe it's not so!

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic!
You know
Never believe it's not so!
It's magic!
You know
Never believe it's not so!
Never believe
