Though you don't call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I wanna tell you, baby
Changes I've been going through, missing you listen you
'til you come back to me that's what I'm gonna do
Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free?
I'm gonna swallow my pride
And beg you to please baby please see me
I'm gonna walk by myself
To prove that my love is true, all for you
'til you come back to me that's what I'm gonna do
Living for you, my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear

Hear my plea
I've gotta make you see that our love is dying
Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must somehow somehow i must explain
I'll have to rap on your door, tap on your window pane
I'm gonna camp by your steps
Until I get through to you
Change your view
'til you come back to me that's what I'm gonna do
'til you come back to me that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna tap on your window pane, don't wanna wait in vain
I'm gonna tap on your window pane, don't wanna wait in vain
