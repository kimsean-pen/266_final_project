Whats up with my heart when it skips a beat?
Can't feel no pavement right under my feet

Up in my lonely room
When I'm dreaming of you
Oh what can I do
I still need you, but
I don't want you now

When I'm down and my hands are tied
I cannot reach a pen for me to draw the line
From this pain I just can't disguise
Its gonna hurt but I'll have to say goodbye

Up in my lonely room
When I'm dreaming of you
Oh what can I do
I still need you, but
I dont want you now

Oh yeah

Up in my lonely room
When I'm dreaming of you
Oh what can I do
I still need you, but
I dont want you now
