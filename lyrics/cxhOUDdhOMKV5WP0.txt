She said, she said
We don't have to let it, ooh
Don't walk away, to see you again

Scorpion can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
It's torture

Scorpion can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
It's torture

And I miss my brothers
Scorpion can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
And I miss my brothers

Scorpion can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
It's torture
And I miss my brothers

Gloria, can't hold me back from her
I swear it's torture
I miss the days out in Biscayne
I miss my brothers
Give me three more weeks to sort this out
I swear I'll prosper
Out in Biscayne and I miss my brothers

Scorpion can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
It's torture

Scorpion can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
It's torture
I miss the good old days back in Biscayne
And I miss my brothers

Scorpion can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
It's torture
And I miss my brothers
I miss the days out in Biscayne
I miss my brothers

Scorpion can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
It's torture
Give me three more weeks to sort this out
I swear I'll prosper
Out in Biscayne and I miss my brothers

And I miss my brothers
She said, she said
We don't have to let it, ooh
And I miss my brothers
Don't walk away, to see you again
