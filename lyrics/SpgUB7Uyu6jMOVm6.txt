Read my mind
They sink crystal in their drinks
I don't hide
Inside, the mistery of your eyes
And my mind
Did I know the junk of your timeline

Still my time
It's running out your safe, goodbye
You can win your life
But you gotta live your life off the timeline

Read my mind
They sink crystal in their drinks
I won't hide
Inside, the mistery of your eyes
And my mind
You can win your life
But you gotta live your life off the timeline
