My man says I'm a smoking gun
They call me cheap champagne
But I'm his Dom Perignon
Kids online say I have too much fun
I get high with the spotlight on
Baby when the crowd goes home
I'm all alone and I've got no one
Baby when the credits roll
No self control
I come undone

I thought you knew I'm filthy rich
I thought you knew I never answer my phone
I thought you knew I was a bitch
I got a driver so I'm never alone
I thought you knew I was a late night cat fight
Cocaine kid with a bad bite
Strung out on pills like Wall Street on a week night, oh
I thought you knew

My man calls me a setting sun
Pretty little hollywood
Gonna have a rolling stone
Spread, page one
And credit cards are so much fun
Jesus won't you save my soul
No self control
I come undone

I thought you knew I'm filthy rich
I thought you knew I never answer my phone
I thought you knew I was a bitch
I got a driver so I'm never alone
I thought you knew I was a late night cat fight
Cocaine kid with a bad bite
Strung out on pills like Wall Street on a week night, oh
I thought you knew
I thought you knew

Maserati gonna be here any minute now
Maserati gonna be here any minute now

I thought you knew I'm filthy rich
I thought you knew I never answer my phone
I thought you knew I was a bitch
I got a driver so I'm never alone
I thought you knew I was a late night cat fight
Cocaine kid with a bad bite
Strung out on pills like Wall Street on a week night, oh
I thought you knew
I thought you knew
I thought you knew
