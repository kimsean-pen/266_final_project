Still Strong

A new stage of life and this old flame still burning and I (I stay true)
To the passion, my conviction and I will say nothing (can stop me)

I suvived every fashion (I'm still strong)
I believe and resist (I'm still strong)
I made this for us (I'm still strong)
By us, together

Survive and live the pression
Survie and fight for us
Time after time here we go again
Stand in the frontline
Stay true, be strong

We survived every fashion
Believe and resist
And made this for passion and glory
Take this pride

Stay true, be strong
Take this pride

I suvived every fashion (I'm still strong)
I believe and resist (I'm still strong)
I made this for us (I'm still strong)
By us, together

Stay true, be strong
Take this pride

Stay true, be strong
Take this pride

Stay true, be strong
Take this pride

Stay true, be strong
Take this pride

Stay true, be strong
Take this pride

Stay true, be strong
Take this pride
