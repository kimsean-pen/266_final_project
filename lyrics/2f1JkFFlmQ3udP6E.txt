And this walk is longer than
I can remember, your
Your hands were cold
Just like my heart and I
I feel you slipping
But I'm a hill made of ice
And I love to slip
so let's slip together
And I love to slip
so let's slip together
This is just a bad dream,
everybody wake up soon
We'll tie our red balloons to my car roof
Friction in your head, friction in mine
I still remember his eyes on mine
This is just a bad dream,
everybody wake up soon
We'll tie our red balloons to my car roof
Friction in your head, friction in mine
I still remember his eyes on mine
So let me break,
For the love of God, let me break
Let me slip to the bottom of this hill
Let my body fall into the pit
into the lion's den with you
So let me break,
For the love of God, let me break
Let me slip to the bottom of this hill
Let my body fall into the pit
into the lion's den with you
It's the lion's den where you will live
It's the lion's den where you will die
It's the lion's den you wrote your name to
And it's the lion's den where you will cry
It's the lion's den where you will live
It's the lion's den where you will die
It's the lion's den you wrote your name to
And it's the lion's den where you will cry
It's the lion's den where you will live
It's the lion's den where you will die
It's the lion's den you wrote your name to
And it's the lion's den where you will cry
She says
This is just a bad dream,
everybody wake up soon
We'll tie our red balloons to my car roof
Friction in your head, friction in mine
I still remember his eyes on mine
This is just a bad dream,
everybody wake up soon
We'll tie our red balloons to my car roof
Friction in your head, friction in mine
I still remember his eyes on mine
So let me break,
For the love of God, let me break
Let me slip to the bottom of this hill
Let my body fall into the pit
into the lion's den
into the lion's den
