Babe, ain't no denyin'
That I've got you in my head
Girl, I'd be flyin'
If you stood yourself and said

You're the one I want
You're the one I need
You're the one I had
So come on back to me

Babe, you're so young and pretty
But you're evil, you oughta know
Darling, ain't that a pity
Won't you stand yourself and show, yeah!

You're the one I want
You're the one I need
You're the one I had
So come on back to me

See, where we've been
Won't you hold my hand and stay a while? Oh!

You're the one I want
You're the one I need
You're the one I had
So come on back to me

You're the one I want
You're the one I need
You're the one I, you're the one I had
So come on back to me, yeah

Yeah, come on baby
Oh!
