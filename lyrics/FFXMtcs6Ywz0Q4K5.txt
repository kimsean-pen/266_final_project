I've fought a monster a mile high
Arm wrestled twenty octopi
I had a sword fight with a samurai
And sang the sirens a lullaby

I've pinned my heart to my sleeve
So that the whole world can see
I have a heart on for you

Well I'm not sure now what's left to do
Or if my actions are loud and clear to you
So I guess that I'm just trying to say
I fucking love you

I guess that I'm just trying to say
I fucking love you

I guess that I'm just trying to say
I fucking love you
I've pinned my heart to my sleeve

So that the whole world can see
I have a heart on for you
Well I'm not sure now what's left to do
Or if my actions are loud and clear to you

So I guess that I'm just trying to say
I fucking love you
I guess that I'm just trying to say
I fucking love you

I guess that I'm just trying to say
I fucking love you
I'm just trying to say

I fucking love you!
I've pinned my heart to my sleeve
So that the whole world can see

I have a heart on for you
I cross my heart
And hope to die
Stick a needle in my eye
I cross my heart
And hope to die
Stick a needle in my eye
If you stick a needle in my eye
I've already crossed my heart and hoped to die
And it's true, I am a fighter with a point to prove
I've fought monsters, sirens and samurai for you

I will take you everywhere I fly
And it doesn't even matter when, where or why
And it's true, I am a lover with a point to prove
I've killed monsters, sirens and samurai for you

If you stick a needle in my eye
I've already crossed my heart and hoped to die

And it's true, I am a fighter with a point to prove
Well I'm not sure now what's left to do
Or if my actions are loud and clear to you
So I guess that I'm just trying to say

I fucking love you
I guess that I'm just trying to say
I fucking love you
I guess that I'm just trying to say
I fucking love you
In the lowest depths, the highest heights
Through the shortest days and the longest nights
The warmest fires, the coldest ice
Through the brightest place and the darkest times
In the lowest depths, the highest heights
Through the shortest days and the longest nights
The warmest fires, the coldest ice
Through the brightest place and the darkest times
I guess that I'm just trying to say
I fucking love you
I'm just trying to say
I fucking love you
I'm just trying to say
I have a heart on for you
