Rounded up, herded in, innocence served.
Tortured, various phases, in witness of family you die.

Hot steel prods into your eyes.
Executioner nods, optics spew.
Tanks roll foreword claiming lives.
Focus of death, nothing new.

Innocent families left to die.
Soldiers murder, God defied.
Iron fist falls heavy with lust.

Systematic execution.
Playing God with his thoughts.
No retribution.
Forever the souls will haunt.
Systematic execution.

Military machines, steel warped with hate.
Death from above, precision bombing translates final acts.
Engines whine, tear through the night.
Weary low morale, caught up in the sights.

Soldiers march, take your land.
Resistance end in slaughter.

Dying screams clutter the sands.
Echoing sounds, chaotic laughter.
The sun is killed, behind a blackened sky.
The son is killed, a father watches him die.

Systematic execution.
Playing God with his thoughts.
No retribution.
Forever the souls will haunt.

Wings of death carry your carcass into the realms of terror.
Crushed beneath the wheels of war.
Doctrine of greed violently implored.
