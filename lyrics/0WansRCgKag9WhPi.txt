At a certain point it happens
Life becomes too real
And nothing can hold back what is about to be

I don't know
How close we need to get
To blind out the surroundings
And focus on the real

I know you're gone
But this reality is crashing down on me
Crashing down to defeat all purpose
I know you're gone
I'm just not ready I'm just not done
I am ever in resistant disbelief

When raw emotion gets in
The way of our thoughts and words
We pass so far beyond our breaking point

I don't know
How far we need to be
From all that we don't want to see
To regain prespective

I know you're gone
But this reality is crashing down on me
Crashing down to defeat all purpose
I know you're gone
I'm just not ready I'm just not done
I am ever in resistant disbelief

I know, yet I fail to find purpose and form
I know, but the truth just makes it harder

I know you're gone
But this reality is crashing down on me
Crashing down to defeat all purpose
I know you're gone
I'm just not ready I'm just not done
I am ever in resistant disbelief
