I tried to part the seas, find wonders for your love.
I sought the best of me but all I showed was what I couldn't be.
Your hush was a beauty I'd not seen,
And your kindness made a gentle wreck of me.

Once hope found hope
And once I travelled winter with the sun.
Your heart was my home; the rest of me will roam into tomorrow,
My love, for tomorrow there's love, there's love.

I climbed the highest heights, where the sightless go to see.
Fixed fate with steely eyes and told her it was not the time for me.
Some things that you give you can't retrieve, and I wait for a day I'll never see.

It was like the moon tide â€“ always rise and then fall.
But now its dead and I'm done, and I won't cry for you no more.

So I the lonely captive stand with only memories to hold my hand,
But I'll not seek to change a thing; it was the best and worst of times.
Beneath the yellow clouded moon where buried hopes rise from their tombs,
The whispers cry to heaven above, that you caught me up in the windy arms of love.

Oh you caught me up in the windy arms, the windy arms of love,
Oh you caught me up in the windy arms, the windy arms of love
Oh you caught me up in the windy arms, the windy arms of love
Oh you caught me up in the windy arms, the windy arms of love
