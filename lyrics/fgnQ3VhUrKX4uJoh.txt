No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one's laughing at God
When they're starving or freezing
Or so very poor
No one laughs at God when the doctor calls
After some routine tests
No one's laughing at God
When it's gotten real late
Their kid's not back from that party yet
No one laughs at God when their airplane
Starts to uncontrollably shake
No one's laughing at God
When they see the one they love
Hand in hand with someone else
And they hope that they're mistaken
No one laughs at God
When the cops knock on their door
And they say "We got some bad news, sir"
No one's laughing at God
When there's a famine, fire, or a flood...
But God could be funny
At a cocktail party while listening to
A good god-themed joke
Or when the crazies say he hates us
And they get so red in
The head you'd think they're about to choke
God could be funny
When told he'll give you money
If you just pray the right way
And when presented like a genie
Who does magic like Houdini
Or grants wishes like Jiminy Cricket
And Santa Claus
God could be so hilarious
Ha-ha, ha-ha
No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one's laughing at god
When they've lost all they got
And they don't know what for
No one laughs at God on the day they realize
That the last sight they'll ever see
Is a pair of hateful eyes
No one's laughing at God
When they're saying their goodbyes
But God could be funny
At a cocktail party while listening to
A good god-themed joke
Or when the crazies say he hates us
And they get so red in
The head you'd think they're about to choke
God could be funny
When told he'll give you money
If you just pray the right way
And when presented like a genie
Who does magic like Houdini
Or grants wishes like Jiminy Cricket
And Santa Claus
God could be so hilarious
No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one's laughing at God in a war
No one's laughing at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one's laughing at God
When they're starving or freezing
Or so very poor
No one's laughing at God
No one's laughing at God
No one's laughing at God
We're all laughing with God
