I tried in vain to let you go
Alisa
But your cries won't cease to echo
Alisa

You're in my heart, you're in my dreams, you're in my soul
Alisa You're in my heart, you're in my dreams, you're in my soul

Beat my chest, pull my hair, and I start to break, oh
Alisa
But that still won't make you go away
Alisa

You're in my heart, you're in my dreams, you're in my soul
Alisa
You're in my heart, you're in my dreams, you're in my soul
Miss you, oh

I thought I could go on, I was wrong
Alisa
Well I need you here to carry on
Alisa

You're in my heart, you're in my dreams, you're in my soul
Alisa
You're in my heart, you're in my dreams, you're in my soul
Gonna cry, gonna cry, hello, bring it on now
Alisa
