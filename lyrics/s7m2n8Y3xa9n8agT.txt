I don't want nobody hurt
But I made an exception with him

I don't want nobody hurt
But I made an exception with him
I'm so lucky I can breathe
When the others cannot swim, no
Cannot swim, no
Cannot swim, no
Cannot swim, no

Don't be nervous
Don't be nervous
Don't be nervous
Don't be nervous

I don't want nobody hurt
But I made an exception with him
I'm so lucky I can swim
When the others cannot breathe, no
Cannot breathe
Cannot breathe, no
Cannot breathe

Don't be nervous
Don't be nervous
Don't be nervous
Don't be nervous

Take me with you
Take me with you

Take me with you
Take me with you
Take me with you
Take me with you
