The wind-soft melody
Sings to me so happily
When you're near me, everything is just so right
When all seems so wrong
Your love reminds me where we belong
You make my cloudy dark skies so bright

So can we
Stay forever-ever like this and
Laugh and love in this happy bliss and as
Time runs through our fingers this
Love, this love will stay and linger so
Hold me close and never, never let go and
Promise to love it every high and low, these
Words you are singing to
Me, you are my everything
My everything
You're my everything
My everything

The planets and stars
And Venus and Mars
No, they don't measure up to you
No, no
And nothing can compare
To you, this I swear
This life we've strung, let's
Never, never undo

So can we
Stay forever-ever like this and
Laugh and love in this happy bliss and as
Time runs through our fingers this
Love, this love will stay and linger so
Hold me close and never, never let go and
Promise to love it every high and low, these
Words you are singing to
Me, you are my everything
My everything
You're my everything
My everything

So let's run with reckless emotion
Let's find out if love is the size of the ocean and a
Hundred ought to be too few word
To carry all my love for you
So let's run with reckless emotion
Let's find out if love is the size of the
Oceans, oceans
Oceans
Oceans, oceans
Oceans

So can we stay forever like this
And just laugh and love in this happy bliss
As time runs through our fingers
This love will stay and linger
So would you hold me close and never let go
Promise to love it every high and low
These words you are singing, oh
To me you are my, my everything
My everything
My everything
My everything
