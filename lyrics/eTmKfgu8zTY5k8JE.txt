She said "I never want to leave you but I gotta go"
And then she left me for a reason that I'll never know
But I don't mind
I'm feeling fine

My mama told me all the things that I already know
Sometimes I feel it in my bones just like an animal
She's on my mind
I guess I'm not alright
But...

I've been through this shit so many times
And I can't deny
I'll give you one more try
I'm hoping things go differently this time
'Cause she could be right
She could be right

Mama told me "Play it cool"
But I can't help if I'm a fool
And in my mind there's only you
'Cause happy endings I can't choose
I guess I'll play it cool

She said you're going way too fast, you gotta take it slow
This love is like a plant, we gotta let it grow
And I said "Why?"
"Sounds like a waste of time"

I'm getting tired of tryna be what you want me to be
But mama told me that I can't keep playing hide and seek
She's on my mind
I'm not gonna lie
But...

I've been through this shit so many times
And I can't deny
I'll give you one more try
I'm hoping things go differently this time
'Cause she could be right
She could be right

Mama told me "Play it cool"
But I can't help if I'm a fool
And in my mind there's only you
'Cause happy endings I can't choose
I guess I'll play it cool

I call the same old things so many times
Some things in life
You just can't rewind
Things don't seem to change although I try
And I know why
And I know why
