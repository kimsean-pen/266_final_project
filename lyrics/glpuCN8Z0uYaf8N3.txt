deep in this haze, I see her face
she creeps to me, she begs for me
I can not go, not this again
I'm much too weak, I'm conquered
and then I feel myself decline
in the grip of ionia
and then I see myself resign
to the lust for Ionia
and then she takes me down, down, down
and then she keeps me down, down, down
and then she speaks of love, love, love
love, love as misery (as I lose control)
she clings to me, she won't let go
and then she takes this all away
she's tainted me, I'm nothing now
I'm so obscure, I'm conquered
and then I feel myself decline
in the grip of Ionia
and then I see myself resign
to the lust for Ionia
of Ionia, oh Ionia, oh Ionia, oh Ionia
this time is not anything, it's nothing
oh Ionia I swear, that you will haunt me
and I'll never know why I resign all the time
and I reach straight for nothing
oh Ionia I swear, in an instant you're lonely
and just like all the time you will throw this aside
and you'll move on to nothing
oh Ionia I see, through the haze she is fading
oh Ionia I see, as I lose control again
