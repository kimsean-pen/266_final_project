I don't wanna hold up, I don't wanna slow down
And try to like you less, it don't make sense to me
I don't wanna wait up, I don't wanna waste time
Just want you and I, with no space in between

Maybe I've been spending way too many nights with you
And I never should've intertwined with you
But what the hell am I supposed to do?
Maybe we should leave it as it is
But I'm gonna end up so miserable
I can't shut it down, shut it down, down

'Cause you and me
We're too damn good to let it be
And I don't wanna keep it on the low, low, low, low, low, low
I don't wanna keep it on the low, low, low, low, low, low

Yeah, you and I
We're too damn good and I can't lie
I don't wanna keep it on the low, low, low, low, low, low
No, I don't wanna keep it on the low, low, low, low, low, low, no

Why you need space now? I don't wanna zoom out
Now, what's wrong with you being close to me? (ye-yeah, ya)
Oh, why you wanna play cool? It's gonna make me hate you, me too
Sorry, I'm just saying what I feel, ohh

But maybe I've been spending way too many nights with you
Having way too many good times with you
But what the hell am I supposed to do?
Maybe we should leave it as it is
But I'm gonna end up so miserable
I can't shut it down, shut it down, down

'Cause you and me
We're too damn good to let it be
And I don't wanna keep it on the low, low, low, low, low, low
(On the low!)
No, I don't wanna keep it on the low, low, low, low, low, low
(On the low!)

Yeah, you and I
We're too damn good and I can't lie
I don't wanna keep it on the low, low, low, low, low, low
(On the low!)
No, I don't wanna keep it on the low, low, low, low, low, low, no

Maybe I've been spending way too many nights with you
Probably never should've intertwined with you
Maybe we should leave it as it is
But I'm gonna end up so miserable
And I can't shut it down, down

'Cause you and me
We're too damn good to let it be
And I don't wanna keep it on the low, low, low, low, low, low
(On the low!)
No, I don't wanna keep it on the low, low, low, low, low, low, no
(On the low!)

Yeah, you and I
We're too damn good and I can't lie
'Cause I don't wanna keep it on the low, low, low, low, low, low
(On the low)
No, I don't wanna keep it on the low, low, low, low, low, low, no
