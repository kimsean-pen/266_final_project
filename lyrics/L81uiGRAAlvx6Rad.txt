My God, you fly thousands of miles to get some sun
And it's rainin' cats and dogs!
Typical tropical, I go on vacation and Mother Nature gives up on me
Yeah, what a lady

Thanks for at least sendin' it down pre-heated!
Doesn't seem to bother the natives, though
Back home it gets no one laughin', and here they even sing to it
Must be some voodoo rain chant or somethin', humph!
And it sure sounds familiar, oh well

I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling, I'm happy again
I'm laughin' at clouds, so dark up above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love

Let the stormy clouds chase, everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, got a smile on my face
I walk down the lane with a happy refrain
I'm singin', just singin' in the rain

Let it rain all day

I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling, I'm happy again
I'm laughin' at clouds, so dark up above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love

Let the stormy clouds chase, everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, got a smile on my face
I walk down the lane with a happy refrain
I'm singin' and dancin' in the rain

Let it rain all day

I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling, I'm happy again
I'm laughin' at clouds, so dark up above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love

Let the stormy clouds chase, everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, got a smile on my face
I walk down the lane with a happy refrain
I am singin' and dancin' just getting wet in the rain

Let it rain all day

Buckets of sunshine that bring me your love
Buckets of sunshine that bring me your love
Let it rain all day, I love the rainy day
We got sunshine, everyday
