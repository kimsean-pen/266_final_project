Take a sleeping pill for insomnia
Turn a blind eye to phenomena
Console yourself
Take off all the chains

I stuck in the dream
Where I'm falling down
Into the abyss
What if it's real?

Close the door and fucking step outside
Leaving all your beasts behind there
Don't lose your nerve
Keep it together
Close your eyes
To save the guiding light

Rip off your masks
Look what's inside
We all have our demons
Send them away
It's sure that it'll keep you safe

Standing at the edge of thirsty eternity
Watching as relief becomes agony
It gets so unclear
What am I'm doing here?
It gets so surreal
It gets so surreal

Lead me through this
Find me a way
I've got no delusions
Show me the way
Until the sun will rise again

I'm walking on my way
Tired of being alone
Lead me through this
Until the sun will rise again
You think it's hard to breach
The inner walls we've built?
Erase the hell we're in
Let it go and breathe

Maybe your lesson will drag me away
Too sad that I'm missing
Too far from this freight

Maybe your lesson will drag me away
Too sad that I'm missing
Too far from this freight

I'm walking on my way
Tired of being alone
Lead me through this
Until the sun will rise again
You think it's hard to breach
The inner walls we've built?
Erase the hell we're in
So just believe
