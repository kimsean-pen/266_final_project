I hear the sound of a clock and the drip of running water
I never thought it'd be like this, it's 3AM and I can't sleep

I had it all planned out, find a girl and get married
Do things that'll make your dreams
Oh look at me, what more could you need?

I knew that I could win a room because I'm always happy
But love is a scary thing
It's what they never taught, and I don't know how it's taken me this far

All I wanted was the world, all you wanted was me

It's only in the end when you were gone
I didn't realize what I had lost
These one night stands are meaningless
But I'm laying in bed with a girl I just met at 3AM

I wish I would have loved you instead of being selfish
And being so obsessed with my dreams
Oh look at me, I'm surrounded by the old me
I thought that I could win you back because I've always had it
But love is a tricky thing,
It's what they never taught,
that when you lose what you love you lose a piece of your heart

All I wanted was the world, all you wanted was me

It's only in the end when you were gone
I didn't realize what I had lost
These one night stands are meaningless
But I'm laying in bed with a girl I just met at 3AM

Every day I still learn from the mistakes that I had made
Who knew that things would be this way?
I'm here because I wouldn't change
I've fallen on my face, but watch me get up again

It's only in the end when you were gone
I didn't realize what I had lost
Now everything else is meaningless
So I'm laying in bed with secret regret at 3AM
