dying sun fades in our sky
the time has come to say goodbye
construct the pods we must evacuate
to the stars, is this to be our fate

oh baby, just maybe we'll take you
to the sun of nothingness

we left the warpigs far behind
plot apocalyptic course to find
will we ever meet our journey's end
to find a world and start again

oh baby, just maybe we'll return
to the sun of nothingness
