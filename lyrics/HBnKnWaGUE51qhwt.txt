In a forgotten time
It happened like this
In a forgotten time
Those forgotten kids
In a forgotten town
Crept under the ground
I wanted their bones
You wanted a kiss

In a forgotten time
Before they were dismissed
From that forgotten town
Those forsaken kids
In a forbidden tongue
Spoke of shadows to come
I search for the light
You searched for my lips

They stopped the parade
Right in our stride
The music died
They unplugged the games
Now we must play
In dark arcades

In a forbidden song
He sang out our names
In a forbidden tome
You wrote of the same
Inappropriate hopes
And hid it beneath
My pillow as I
Pretended to sleep

They stopped the parade
Right in our stride
The music died
They unplugged the games
Now we must play
In dark arcades

Here we stay where we were meant to play
And every night, every night
As he writes
I'm searching for the light
Or any light, any light
I pray to the death
You'll light up our life

They stopped the parade
Right in our stride
The music died
They unplugged the games
Now we must play
In dark arcades

They stopped the parade
Right in our stride
The music died
They unplugged the games
Now we must play
In dark arcades
