Tell me something I don't know
It sits inside my mind
I feel it in my bones

A sign of the times
I sat in your life with nowhere to hide
And still you couldn't find me
Maybe you could find me
Somewhere else that I could be

Everything you said to me...
How was I to know?
When you said goodbye
You let me go

All of the time we wasted
Feels like a life ago
If I failed you
Then you're better off alone
I still see you in Monochrome

We're stuck in a place and time
We can't intertwine the rhythm and rhyme
So, what's the use of trying
When our thoughts just don't align?

Everything you said to me on the telephone
When you said goodbye
You let me go

All of the time we wasted
Feels like a life ago
If I failed you
Then you're better off alone
I still see you in Monochrome.

You're all I see
You're haunting me
The colours glow
A lifetime ago

All of the time we wasted
Feels like a life ago
If I failed you
Then you're better off alone
I still see you in Monochrome

I still see you in Monochrome
