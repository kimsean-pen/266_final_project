Late night, waiting by the phone
Tonight waiting for an answer
Heartbeat drumming double time
I need one more chance to be near you

Still hanging on
(For what)
Can't operate
(Fired up)
I won't eat and I won't sleep for you, yeah
No rest till I

(Get through)
'Cause I'm holding out
(For you)
Am I the only one who's insane?

Hey, you're playing with my delirium
And the longer I wait the harder I'm gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium
'Cause I'm outta my head and outta my self-control

Still here in this quiet room
Deep in delusion sending me over
Outside watch the world go by
Inside time stands still as I wonder
Still hanging on
(For what?)

Can't operate
(Fired up)
I won't eat and I won't sleep for you, yeah
No rest till I

(Get through)

'Cause I'm holding out
(For you)
Am I the only one who's insane
Hey, you're playing with my delirium
And the longer I wait the harder I'm gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium
'Cause I'm outta my head and outta my self-control
(I won't eat and I won't sleep for you, yeah)
Hey, you're playing with my delirium
And the longer I wait the harder I'm gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium
'Cause I'm outta my head and outta my self-control
Hey, you're playing with my delirium
And the longer I wait the harder I'm gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium
'Cause I'm outta my head and outta my self-control
