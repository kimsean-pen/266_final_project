I got lost out there in this world
Looking for a brand new way to fall down
It's no surprise that things got worse
I thank God you never let me drown

But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long
I didn't have to let myself get so far gone
I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone
I didn't have to die to go to heaven
I just had to go home

While I was having the time of my life
I think my soul died a little every day
I always called to say I'm sorry
You said it's okay, but you should be
Through it all you never walked away

But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long
I didn't have to let myself get so far gone
I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone
I didn't have to die to go to heaven
I just had to go home

Into the arms of my angel
Into the peace I've left behind
All I had to do to save my own life
Was to look into your eyes

But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long
I didn't have to let myself get so far gone
I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone
I didn't have to die to go to heaven (to find my angel)
But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long
I just had to go home (I just had to go home)
I just had to go home
