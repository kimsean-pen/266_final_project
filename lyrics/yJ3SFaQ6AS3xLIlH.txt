Oh, light a candle's fire, it carries our good name
What would you ask a campfire?
It scares me just the same
And you, you've had it all along
An endless need for games
Just don't forget, a candle's fire is only just a flame

I hit certain from afar, failed to pull my weight
But you were light, we traveled through the fall
To arrive at our front gate
Tonight, we rest beside the fire
A smile upon your face
Just don't forget,
a candle's fire is only just a flame

If I had known not to carry on that way
It wouldn't show in the creases on your face
If you should go, would you carry on my name?
Just let it blow, in the fog on Bishop's lane
