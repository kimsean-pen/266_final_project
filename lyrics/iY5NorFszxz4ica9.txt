I'm just walking, girls were talking
Nothing crazy, a typical night
Situation we always facing, haters hating
They must have no life

I can't stand how do they manage
To find my flaws that I'm sure
There is something they could be doing
Other then thinking about me

Things will always be like this
As long as jealously exists
That's not how I choose to be
I'm cool being simply me

I got mine and you got yours
Take a little, make it more
Only way that you can be
Is being comfortable in your skin

What you have is not for me
If I got to be, I be
The true life only begins
Being comfortable in your skin

They still lookin', keep it pushin'
Run into the ultra mistakes
Something happened as we were passin'
Made me stop, I had to say something

Hey, there ladies is this the way
We should do each other? If it's that tape
Take the energy you use to hate on me
It will get you further

No, that's just not me
I'll never agree with negativity
You can keep that over there

Things will always be like this
As long as jealously exists
That's not how I choose to be
I'm cool being simply me

I got mine and you got yours
Take a little, make it more
Only way that you can be
Is being comfortable in your skin

What you have is not for me
If I got to be, I be
The true life only begins
Being comfortable in your skin

What's this about? She won't get off it
Staring like she wanna get into it, blaze and skip
Finally I had to approach, she tells me
Tells me her man's the one I can't get with, wait hold it
Is that what this about? Girl, please

Things will always be like this long
As long as jealousy exists
That's not how I choose to be
I'm cool being simply me

We don't need to waste the time
Maybe this is all a sign
Way I see it's good to know
Here's the problem, let it go

I got mine and you got yours
Take a little, make it more
Only way that you can be
Is being comfortable in your skin

What you have is not for me
If I got to be, I be
The true life only begins
Being comfortable in your skin
