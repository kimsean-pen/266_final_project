it's you and me
it's slow dancin to anything playin
it's us colliding
it's never findin when we should say when
I, I, I can feel it
when i look in your eyes so clearly
I, I can see that you need me
and all that we were
I, I can taste it
all the days that you've been wastin
I, I know that you can't face them
and all that we were
In a moment
you were everything to me
in this moment
we're livin in a heartbreak dream
we're livin in a heartbreak dream
it's holding hands
it's making plans that we're never keeping
it's silent drivin
it's always findin reasons to sleep in
ah, ah when you're near me
I'm yellin and you can't hear me
can you feel me
and all that we were
I, I can taste it
all the days we've been wastin
i know that you can't face them
and all that we were
In a moment
you were everything to me
In this moment
we're livin in a heartbreak dreamWe're livin in a heartbreak dream
When you hold me
it feels like you don't know me
We are worlds apart
When you kiss me
i know you haven't missed me
You keep breaking my heartIn a moment
you were everything to me
In this moment
we're livin in a heartbreak dream(End)
