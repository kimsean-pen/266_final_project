Going through changes from back where I once began
A distant stranger I used to know so long ago
Enlighten me, 'lighten me up
Make me all over again
Come on a let me in, yeah

It was like a lifetime passed right through my fingers (through my fingers)
So long ago, so much that I didn't know (so much that I didn't know)
Kind of like a light shined down and showed me how
How to move on, that was then and this is now

Waking up it seems, am I the dreamer or the dream
Is it possible to know (Is it possible to know), tomorrow unfolds too slow, yeah
Shakin' me, waking me up, clearing my vision again
Seems like I'm born again

It was like a lifetime passed right through my fingers (through my fingers)
So long ago (so long ago), so much that I didn't know (so much that I didn't know)
Kind of like a light shined down and showed me how (showed me how)
How to move on, that was then and this is now (this is now)

Like a lifetime passed right through my fingers (through my fingers)
So long ago (So long ago), so much that I didn't know (so much that I didn't know)
Kind of like a light shined down and showed me how (showed me how, yeah)
How to move on (How to move on), that was then and this is now

It was like a lifetime passed right through my fingers (through my fingers)
So long ago (so long ago), so much that I didn't know (so many things, yeah)
