See me coming
You can hear my sound
Tell somebody in your town
Spread the word

Go call the police
Go call the governor
I bring the treble
Don't mean to trouble ya

I make it bubble up
Call me the bubbler
I am the bad bitch
The bitch that you'll never know

Hold your head high
Fingers to the sky
They gon' try to try ya
But they can't deny ya
Keep it floating higher and higher
Keep it floating higher and higher
So hold your head high
Fingers to the sky
Now they don't believe ya
But they gonna need ya
Keep it floating higher and higher
Keep it floating higher and higher
And higher
Work, work, work...
Work it out, work it out...
You better work, bitch
You better work, bitch
