Chorus: Call me hurricane Jane.
Dry season's over.
Here comes the rain.
Sweeping over your plain.
Blazing as I go.
Call me hurricane Jane.
This kind of weather's hard to contain.
Nothing's ever the same.
When I start to blow.

Far from home.
Lonely time,
Thinking about.
You and I.
Pictures form in my mind.
All of them remain.
Here I go like before.
Signs that I can't ignore.
Close my eyes.
Cue the storm.
Ready for the change...
Call me.

Chorus.

Rushing in like a flood.
Barren Land.
Turns to mud
Every thought heats the blood.
Temperature will rise.
Ready to pump and it's all good,
I love me better than anyone could,
You insipre like you should and I cannot deny.

Chorus.

Said I rage like a fire.
And I flow like the water.
Ain't no surprise I was born under aries sign.
This is my body.
So I do what I choose.
Nothing to hide when I'm alone.
Cause there aint no rules.

Chorus.
