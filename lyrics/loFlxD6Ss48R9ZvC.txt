My mood is inconsistent and it changes with the weather.
In the city of resistance, I haven't been feeling better about anything or anyone that I chose to believe in.
And something tells me I won't find the one thing that I needed

I'll pick myself up everyday.
Won't let the world around me become a cage I can't escape.
I keep in touch with my mistakes,
but when they surround me it's another panic state

And I never said a word about the way that I was feeling,
'cause I trained myself to lie and tell myself that I am fine.
Ever since I was a kid, I've always kept this pain inside.
And I never had that person that made everything alright

My mood is inconsistent and it changes with the weather.
In the city of resistance, I haven't been feeling better about
anything or anyone that I chose to believe in. Something tells me I'm about to see the consequence of feeling

If you ever tried to ask me what was going on inside,
I would sit alone in silence while my thoughts eat me alive

If I could just go back in time and stop myself,
I'd stop myself from holding everything inside of my head.
In my head lies the consequence of every feeling that I hide
