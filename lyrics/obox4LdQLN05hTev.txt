I'm sorry for the demon I've become
You should be sorry for the angel you are not
I apologize for the cruel things that I did
But I don't regret one single word I said

Just walk away, make it easy on yourself
Just walk away, please release me from this hell
Just walk away, there's just nothing left to feel
Just walk away, pretend that none of this is real

Forgive me if I told you that I cared
Would you be sorry if I swore that I'd be there
Please forgive me for laughing when you fall
I'm so sorry but I never cared at all

Just walk away, make it easy on yourself
Just walk away, please release me from this hell
Just walk away, there's just nothing left to feel
Just walk away, pretend that none of this is
None of this is

Just walk away, make it easy on us both
Just walk away, there was never any hope
Just walk away, you already know the deal
Just walk away, pretend that none of this was
None of this was real
