Medicated to the point of apathy
Each day another little pill to swallow
Dosing those composing hopes, they tear at the seams
And embrace it, a sickness bought
Building these addictions for the sake of a dollar
Devil's got his hands in all our pockets
Close to broke, alone exposing beyond our means
Till we're vacant from the lie we bought

I won't be one of your puzzle pieces
Forced into fitting
Pardon me but there's a part of me
That feels something's missing
Are we living or are we just dying?
It's time we wage a war really worth fighting
I don't wanna be another puzzle piece
I don't wanna be part of your puzzle

Glorifying monsters, it sells on TV
If it bleeds, it reads in papers out tomorrow
We say we'll pray for change one day but afraid what it means
Face it, we'll take it, no lessons learned
Talking heads addicted to the sound of their voice
The devil's got us all in his pocket
Mistakes we made and this game we played now change everything
Well we fake it, no lesson learned

I won't be one of your puzzle pieces
Forced into fitting
Pardon me but there's a part of me
That feels something's missing
Are we living or are we just dying?
It's time we wage a war really worth fighting
I don't wanna be another puzzle piece
I don't wanna be part of your puzzle

No-oh, no-oh, we're gonna find a way
Oh-oh, oh-oh, to overcome
Oh-oh, oh-oh, we're gonna find a way
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I won't be one of your puzzle pieces
Forced into fitting
Pardon me but there's a part of me
That feels something's missing
Are we living or are we just dying?
It's time we wage a war really worth fighting
I don't wanna be another puzzle piece
I don't wanna be part of your puzzle

We're gonna find some way
To overcome
Together we'll find the way
