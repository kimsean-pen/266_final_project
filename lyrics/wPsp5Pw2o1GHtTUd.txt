You can't fight the temptation
When you get the vibration
It won't do you no good
It won't do you no good

And you better start running
When you hear the man coming
It won't do you no good
It won't do you no good

We don't mind, if you don't mind
Hell, I never mind

Now don't let them all break you
Let the feeling come take you
It won't do you no good
It won't do you no good

And you know I got fever
So won't you hit me right you know you might as well
It won't do you no good
Said it won't do you no good

Kiss your baby goodbye
Come on love it's alright
Heaven knows they wanna break you apart
Kiss your baby goodbye
Come on now it's alright
You never know unless you give it a try

You can't fight the temptation
When you get the vibration
It won't do you no good
It won't do you no good

And you can tell I got fever
Try to shake it off, try it all you want
It won't do you no good
It won't do you no good

Kiss your baby goodbye
Come on love it's alright
Heaven knows they wanna break you apart
Kiss your baby goodbye
Come on now it's alright
You never know unless you give it a try
