2 eyes starring back at me
On a magazine in my room
Could help paper tragedies?
Paper tragedies
So what goes a memory
If it only feeds ...
Creating a fantasy
Something I can read, its true
I will never look away, if you stay
If you stay
I will never look away
If you stay, if you stay
I dont see it
In the message left for me
I never figured out how to unfold your paper
I rip the edges
You give me pleasure figuring it out
Each question in a trap
Its like forever, forever
Will never look away, if you stay
If you stay
I will never look away
If you stay, if you stay
I will never look away, if you stay
If you stay
I will never look away
If you stay, if you stay
You know, when I close my eyes
I see how much I lost
Prescribe to a memory
That I lost in the... zone
Reveal the jaggin lines through black and white
When I close my eyes
If I close my eyes
But I cant laugh about it
Its all to soon
The things we used to joke about
How all come true
I have to slowly back away
I will never look away, if you stay
If you stay
I will never look away
If you stay
