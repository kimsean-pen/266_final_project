Is there a photo of me on your wall
In short short-shorts or zipped down jeans?
Do you look up at night and wish you were me, under the spotlight?
Are you visceral viscous?
Do you want to make love to my sweet visage?
And then pretend it's you, it's you, it was always you

I wrote you a letter to become a member of your fanclub
But all I got in the mail was return to sender

I'm still a big big star
No, you're not
Yes, I am
No, you're not
Yes, I am
No, you're not
You liked my latest film
No, I didn't
Yes, you did
No, I didn't
Yes, you did
No, I didn't

I'm not a fan of yours anymore
Yes, you are
No, I'm not
Yes, you are
No, I'm not
Yes, you are
But you broke my fragile heart
No, I didn't
Yes, you did
No, I didn't
Yes, you did
No, I didn't

I hate you
I hate you too
I hate you
I hate you too

I hate you (I hate you)
I hate you (I hate you)
I hate you (I hate you)
I hate you (I hate you)
I hate you (I hate you)
I hate you (I hate you)
I hate you (I hate you)
I hate you (I hate you)
