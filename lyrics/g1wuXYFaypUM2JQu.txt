Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up

Well, are you ready now
For the revolution
For too long your power has been taken away

It's been taken away
Does your heart feel heavy now
Savor the solution

Take those mental shackles off and throw them away
You've got to get them out of your mind
Don't you let their vision leave you blind

Moving steady now
It's a revelation
For so long your focus has been taken away
Now you're breaking away

They may think they know you, but here's an education
No, they can't control you
Once you've broken away
They're done patrolling your mind

When they're searching for you, they will find
A force they aren't ready for
(Are you ready!)

They aren't ready for you to be strong
(Are you ready!)
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong

(Are your ready!)
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone
Who cannot be preyed upon

That's enough already now
You don't want to take it
All your reservations have been taken away

They've been taken away
So you think you're ready now
For the revolution

Yeah, they can't control you
Once you've broken away
You've got to get them out of your mind

When they stand before you they will find
A force they aren't ready for
(Are your ready!)

They aren't ready for you to be strong
(Are you ready!)
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong

(Are your ready!)
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone
Who cannot be preyed upon

(Are you ready!)
You've got to get them out of your mind
When they stand before you they will find

A force they aren't ready for
(Are your ready!)
They aren't ready for you to be strong

(Are you ready!)
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
(Are you ready!)

They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone
Who cannot be preyed upon

(Are you ready!)
They aren't ready for us to be strong

(Are you ready!)
They aren't ready for us to prove them wrong
(Are your ready!)

Then you know your ready to be turned
into people who cannot be preyed upon

(Are you ready!)
(Are you ready!)
(Are you ready!)
We cannot be preyed upon
(Are you ready?)
(Are you ready?)
(Are you reeeeedy?)
