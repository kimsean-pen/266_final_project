When you wake, what is it that you think of most?
When your bed is empty, do you really sleep alone?
If I imagine you, body next to another

All around me new love and it makes me sad
All around me feeling sure that you'll be bad
If I imagine you, body next to another

Stop crying to the ocean
Stop crying over me
Stop worrying over nothing
Stop worrying over me

So it's been so long since you said,
"Well I know what I want, what I want is right here with you."

On the drive back here, I was worried over nothing
On the drive back there, tears spilling over something
When I imagine you, body next to another

In the door, and you're there, and you're sorry for the fright
In the door, did I hear saying you don't wanna fight?
When I imagine you, body next to another

Stop crying to the ocean
Stop crying over me
Stop worrying over nothing
Stop worrying over me

So it's been so long since you said,
"Well I know what I want, what I want is right here with you."
It's been so long since you said,
"Well I know what I want, what I want is right here with you."

In a flash, back to you just brought attention to the mess
In a flash, you're on top, begging me to understand
If I imagine you, body next to another

You drop in for a minute
I'm sorry that I didn't drop in sooner just to see you
And see what you've been doing
If I imagine you, body next to another

So it's been so long since you said,
"Well I know what I want, what I want is right here with you."
It's been so long since you said,
"Well I know what I want, what I want is right here with you."
It's been so long since you said,
"Well I know what I want, what I want is right here with you."
It's been so long since you said,
"Well I know what I want, what I want is right here with you."
