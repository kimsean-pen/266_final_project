Everybody's tryin' to get to me
Every guy is out for the kill
I'm the type of girl worth pursuing
But I won't be caught standing still
No I won't

You're throwin' all of your attention on me
Take your best shot I bet you'll miss
You've got me interested enough to stand closer
Maybe try a 'lil kiss

You hit the bullseye baby
You hit the bullseye baby
Now I'm into you crazy
You know you hit the mark
Don't know how you got me started
I'm not an easy target
Hit it
You hit the bullseye
You hit my heart

I'm surprised the way you affect me
Like an arrow penetrating my heart
Naturally you seem to just get me
So obviously you're pretty smart
Ha ha ha

I like the way you're all dressed up messed up
I like the way you don't care
I wasn't certain that you'd ring my bell but
Then you whispered in my ear

You hit the bullseye baby
You hit the bullseye baby
Now I'm into you crazy
You know you hit the mark
Don't know how you got me started
I'm not an easy target
Hit it
You hit the bullseye
You hit my heart
You hit my heart

You didn't ask me for my number?
Wait, you didn't ask me for my number?
I like the fact that you didn't ask that
'Cuz you already got my number, huh?

You hit the bullseye baby
You hit the bullseye baby
Now I'm into you crazy
You know you hit the mark
Don't know how you got me started
I'm not an easy target
Hit it

Yeah yeah yeah
You hit the bullseye
Yeah yeah yeah
You hit the bullseye
Yeah yeah yeah
You hit the bullseye
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You hit my heart
