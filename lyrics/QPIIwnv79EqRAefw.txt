We all die
The goal isn't to live forever
The goal is to create something that will

I keep on hearing them saying what I should do
I, I've come to see it through to the end of the line
In the end of my commission is the actual condition of my life
I'll begin my transformation to the only definition of my fight

So leave the world behind, I follow on my deepest desires
Remember every sign form the past it took me higher than life

So leave leave the world behind and I follow on my deepest desires
Remember every sign from the past it took me higher than life
We're gonna settle the score

My, my quests just keep on lingering one at a time
I, I've come so far that yet it's the end of the line
And the action of sedition is the single premonition that I find
So I alter my decision and the final destination will combine

So leave the world behind and I follow on my deepest desires
Remember every sign form the past it took me higher than life
We're gonna settle the score

I opened the gateway to something inceptional
In the eye of the storm I sent the delusional

So leave the world behind, I follow on my deepest desires
Remember every sign from the past it took me higher than life

So leave the world behind and I follow on my deepest desires
Remember every sign from the past it took me higher than life
We're gonna settle the score
