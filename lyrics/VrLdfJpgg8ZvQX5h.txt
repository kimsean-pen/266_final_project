You tell lies when the truth will do
You are the social chameleon
What on earth we gonna do with you?
Slip your neck into a rope

Show me a smile, you? d run a mile
Then you are free, so where? s the goal?
Where? s the style?
You want the dough

Got dead sea scrolls for you
And your woman too

She? s got corpses in her mouths
Still she? s holding hands with you
It? s cut like crystal chandeliers
I? ll shine like diamonds in her ears

She smokes crack
It? s off the beaten track
You are the social chameleon
Yes, you change to suit the people around you

It? s like the waves that hit the shore
You cannot stand the force of law
Look man, I know it from your nature
Hit the deck, as the creator

Got dead sea scrolls for you
And your woman too

She? s got corpses in her mouths
Still she? s holding hands with you
It? s cut like crystal chandeliers
I? ll shine like diamonds in her ears
She got corpses in her mouths
Still she's holding hands with you
It? s cut like crystal chandeliers
I? ll shine like diamonds in her ears
She? s got corpses in her mouth
