Baby's on the road
Trying to find what's golden
Never gonna hold her down
I'm chilling on the sofa
I don't wanna yoga
I don't want to life right now

And ooh, I see outside it's changing season's
But I'm burning all my daylight sleeping

I want you to know that I'm still trying
(Baby, be my guru)
You see through my bad, you know I have my moods
When I'm super low you pull me higher
(Baby, be my guru)
We're miles apart, but not at heart, my guru

She called me from a train
Headed to a plane
Coming for a week or two
Gotta clean my act up
I don't wanna act up
So I gotta find my groove

Good vibrations swirling around me
So why does changing hurt so badly

I want you to know that I'm still trying
(Baby, be my guru)
You see through my bad, you know I have my moods
When I'm super low you pull me higher
(Baby, be my guru)
We're miles apart, but not at heart, my guru

Got some scruff going, gotta shave it
Get my diet up, no more eating bacon
Get a bathe in, bet it'd feel amazing
Climb up from the cave I created in my basement

And even if I'm slow she's patient with the pace I grow
(Oh you know she is)
And when I am alone she's with me every place I go

I want you to know that I'm still trying
(Baby, be my guru)
You see through my bad, you know I have my moods
When I'm super low you pull me higher
(Baby, be my guru)
We're miles apart, but not at heart, my guru
