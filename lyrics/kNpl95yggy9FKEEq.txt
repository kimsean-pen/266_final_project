Measuring a summer's day
I only find it slips away to gray
And the hours they bring me pain
Tangerine, tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now, a thousand years between
Thinking how it used to be
Does she still remember times like these
To think of us again
And I do
Tangerine, tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now, a thousand years between
