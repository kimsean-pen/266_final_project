Let not my Corpse Rot in the Necropolis
Let not my crimes be raised against me Whilein the Earth
Make my flesh and bones safe from Maggots
And Any False God who Trepasses my Tomb

You whose heart has been Seized from thy breast
Save me from the Ravages of Deacay
The CrawlingFeinds Who Take away Limbs
Corpses who Deny the Inevitable Truth
The Lifetime of Osiris is the Sky And theirs is the Ground

Save me from those Imprisoned in the Duat
Who Know not yet they are already Dead

Save me from the Rotting dead
who sleep inside Their corpses
Whose breath becomes fire inside their water
at whose burning the sea rises at dawn

Grant Methe Immolating Flame
Burn my sarcophagus
In opposition to the lords of eternity
I beg you
Prevent my corpse from putrefying in the realm of the dead

Enduring the eternal molestation of flame
The life time of Osiris is the Sky and Theirs is the Ground
