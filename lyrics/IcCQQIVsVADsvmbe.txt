Don't let the kids win, just let them lose
they're not gonna learn anything
if that's all you choose to play.
dont let the kids win, just let them fall
don't want them growing up thinking
two year olds are good at playing basketball

don't let your grandmother die while you're away,
cheap trip to thailsnd's not gonna make up for never getting to say goodbye
don't let your brother stop thinking you're cool
yeah i know he's got a girlfriend now and he's taller but that don't mean he stopped looking up to you

and i've got a feeling that this won't ever change, we're gonna keep on getting older
it's gonna keep on feeling strange

don't let your friends turn cold
while you burn to green
when they walk off a stage, embrace them and say that's the best shit i've ever seen
and don't let your sister walk down the aisle
without pulling her close saying i love you and it's okay if i don't see you for a while

and i've got a feeling that this won't ever change, we're gonna keep on getting older
it's gonna keep on feeling strange

don't let the time go by without sitting your mother down and asking what life was like for her before you came to be around and tell her it's okay if she puts herself first, us kids will be alright if we're not the centre of her universe

and i've got a feeling that this won't ever change, we're gonna keep on getting older
it's gonna keep on feeling strange
and after a late one, i don't know anything
except the more i keep on talking the less breath i got left to sing
