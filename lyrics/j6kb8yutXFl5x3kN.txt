Inform is a bad word, a metaphor
You haven't heard and I'd inform
With a bad word, a metaphor
You haven't heard but I'm insane
Can't believe the men who say "Get off your knees."
I haven't seen who you brought to bed,
but you're turning red and I'm out of air.

She ran away with the boy, but I'm not scared it's happened before.
She ran away with the boy, oh no...

I can't tolerate yesterday.
I can't tolerate yesterday.

Some men, they believe, other men get down on their knees.
Some men, they can see other men have lost their seed but I
I wanna wake up to the sunrise, light before my eyes.
I've heard that you have said it:
Keep on doubting on our knees.

She ran away with the boy, but I'm not scared it's happened before.
She ran away with the boy, oh no...

I can't tolerate yesterday.
I can't tolerate yesterday.

Run around, Run around.

All the things that you helped buy
All the men you helped to lie.
All this time you were right, you were wrong.

She ran away with the boy, but I'm not scared it's happened before.
She ran away with the boy, oh no...

I can't tolerate yesterday.
I can't tolerate yesterday.
I can't tolerate yesterday.
