Send me no wine to make an invitation
Leave me no time in your imagination
Only to find
Words in your mind
They're gonna make you leave your
Leave your heart behind

Send me, send me no wine
To send my love away
Send me, send me no wine
To send my love away

Once in my life I need no conversation
All of my time I spent in fascination
Give you my love
For you in my life
If only everybody found the answer in love

Send me, send me no wine
To send my love away
Send me, send me no wine
To send my love away

Send me, send me no wine
To send my love away
Send me, send me no wine
To send my love away

Send me, send me no wine
To send my love away
