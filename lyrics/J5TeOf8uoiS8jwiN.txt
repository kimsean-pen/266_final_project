"To hear something new is hard and
painful for the ear. We hear the music
of foreigners badly."
I make the sounds that you can't understand
This is my critique!
This is my subversion!
This is my revolution!
I make the sounds that you can't
understand. My fingers, my voice
Slide into every orifice.
You (I) own these words.
This is friendship.
That's what friends are for
I AM NIETZCHE!
