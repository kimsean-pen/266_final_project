In the morning
Wake up choking but it's sunny, uuh
They're the same, too
When you blame everybody

Still I'll be your dog
Still I'll be your dog
Still I'll be your dog
Still I'll be your
Uuuh
Still I'll be your dog
Still I'll be your dog
Still I'll be your dog
Still I'll be your

In the evening
Less than even but I'm coming, uuh
They're the same, too
Like I'm doing this for nothing, uuh

Still I'll be your dog
Still I'll be your
Uuuh
Still I'll be your dog
Still I'll be your
