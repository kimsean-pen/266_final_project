When we were young, the world
Seemed so old
Careless and cold
We did what we were told in our lives
When we were young

Had the world by the tail
Good would prevail
Starships would sail
And none of us would fail in this life
Not when you're young

We were drawn to whoever could keep us together
And bound by the Heavens above
And we tried to survive
Travelling at the speed of love

Wooaaah, when we were young
When we adored the fabulous
Wooaaah, when we were young
We were the foolish fearless
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
Wooaaah, when we were young

In a moment of grace
A long leap of faith
There's still more glorious dawn awaits
My life
I'm here with the lovers (I'm here with the lovers)

Then we burned the bridges we're crossing over
Just to see the firelight
And the innocent are getting over
Being old tonight

Wooaaah, when we were young
When everything was what it seemed
Wooaaah, when we were young
And everyday was how we dreamed
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
Wooaaah, when we were young

And when you look at yourself tonight
Are you someone you recognise?
You can take back what you've given away
But it must be the last time

Wooaaah, when we were young
Wooaaah, when we were young
When we were young

Wooaaah, when we were young
When we adored the fabulous
Wooaaah, when we were young
We were the foolish fearless
Wooaaah, when we were young
We didn't know it wouldn't last
Wooaaah, when we were young
