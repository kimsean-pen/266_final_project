Let me lay it on the line
I got a little freakiness inside
And you know that the man
Has gotta deal with it
I don't care what they say
I'm not about to pay nobody's way
'Cause it's all about the dog in me, uh huh
I want a freak in the morning
A freak in the evening, just like me
I need a roughneck brother that can satisfy me, just for me
If you are that kind of man
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
I got a freaky secret, everybody sing
'Cause we don't give a damn about a thing
'Cause I will be a freak until the day, until the dawn
And we can (pump, pump)
All through the night till the early morn
Come on and I will take you around the 'hood on a gangsta lean
'Cause we can (pump, pump)
Any time of day, it's all good for me
Boy, you're moving kind of slow
You got to keep it up, now there you go
There's just one thing that a man must do, uh huh
I'm packing all the flavor you need
I got you shook up on your knees
'Cause it's all about the dog in me
I want a freak in the morning
A freak in the evening, just like me
I need a roughneck brother that can satisfy me, just for me
If you are that kind of man
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
I got a freaky secret, everybody sing
'Cause we don't give a damn about a thing
'Cause I will be a freak until the day, until the dawn (oh yeah)
And we can (pump, pump)
All through the night till the early morn
Come on and I will take you around the 'hood on a gangsta lean (take you around the hood baby)
'Cause we can (pump, pump)
Any time of day, it's all good for me (it's all good 'cause I will be a freak until the day)
'Cause I will be a freak until the day, until the dawn (until the dawn)
And we can (pump, pump)
All through the night till the early morn (you bring out the freak in me)
Come on and I will take you around the 'hood on a gangsta lean (take you around the hood baby)
'Cause we can (pump, pump)
Any time of day, it's all good for me (it's all good for me)
