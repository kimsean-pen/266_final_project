Chingy, Track Stars dirty, well
I got a caprice on 24's
I got a range rover with spinners
I got an imparler with beat lets go

I do ride Bentleys and coupes
But I don't give away all my loot
Trick four've us and a tramp - I won't (I won't)
Ride less then twenty inches I don't (I don't)

But I do know this may be a single
When I walk my chains on so it my jingle if she give me brainzz on.
The haters know were my crew so famous that I cant go no wherin tha lou

I do ride Bentleys and coupes

Trick four've us and a tramp - I won't (I won't)
Ride less then twenty inches I don't (I don't)
