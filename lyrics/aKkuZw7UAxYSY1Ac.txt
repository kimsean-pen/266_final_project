I'm letting you go
I'm setting you free
I no longer love
Head over heels

Morning will come
My heart will break
So before you replace me
Lie with me one last time

Just like a dream
Oh come, come back to me
And I'll still believe
If you stay baby, stay with me
Darling I beg, come back to me
Just like a dream

Before you forget
Was I ever real
Before you forgive me darling
For love I can't feel
Before I replace you
Lie with me one last time

Just like a dream
Oh come, come back to me
And I'll still believe
If you stay baby, stay with me
Darling I beg, come back to me
Just like a dream

You're making my heart bleed honey
Don't ever forget me honey

Just like a dream,
Oh come, come back to me
And I'll still believe
If you stay baby, stay with me
Darling I beg, come back to me
Just like a dream

Just like a dream
Oh come, come back to me
And I'll still believe
If you stay baby, stay with me
Darling I beg, come back to me
Just like a dream
