I'm a one boy, one boy girl
You know I'm a one boy girl

Some girls, say in their world
They couldn't bear to have just him
But I don't need a load of guys
To pump up my self esteem

(Girl what you doin' with just one guy?)
Given' all my lovin'
(What you gonna do when there's lipstick on his collar?)
(You're gonna get old before your time)
You can't tell me nothing 'bout this man of mine

No other love could ever compare to my lover
I'm a one boy, one boy girl
No other touch could mean half as much as my lover
You know I'm a one boy girl

Check it out, some guys never realize
What a girl needs from a man
But my guy always satisfies
It's a love we understand

(Don't you wanna go out and play?)
I'm sorry but I'm busy
(What if you call and there isn't any answer?)
(You're gonna find him gone one day)
He'll always be with me no matter what you say

No other love could ever compare to my lover
I'm a one boy, one boy girl
No other touch could mean half as much as my lover
You know I'm a one boy girl

No other kiss is one that I miss like my lover
I'm a one boy, one boy girl
No other man could love like he can, he's my lover
You know I'm a one boy girl

Hey yo, Kylie
(Mm hmm)
What's up with this one boy girl, thing?
Well, let me break it down like this
(Yeah, right)

It doesn't pay to stay or be good
You know how guys are, I don't think he could
Be with just one, and what if he cheats ya?
Girl just have fun, go out and meet ya
Two or three more

(I don't think so)
You should see more
(No I don't think so)
How could you be sure?
(I believe him)
You're in for heartbeat, you don't need him

What if he hurts you?
(He won't do that)
Are you sure?
(Yeah, that's a fact)
There's lots of guys in this world
Not for me, I'm a one boy girl

No other love
My lover, oh
One boy, one boy girl

No other touch
My lover, oh
One boy, one boy girl

No other love could ever compare to my lover
I'm a one boy, one boy girl
No other touch could mean half as much as my lover
You know I'm a one boy girl

He's my one boy, number one boy
How can I be lonely?
He's my one and only

He's my one boy, number one boy
Can't deny that he's my guy
Won't never have to say goodbye

He's my one boy, number one boy
He'll be with me 'til the end
All his love can't be bad
