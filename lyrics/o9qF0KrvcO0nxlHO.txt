You might fix me
You might crush me
Take a little piece of me

Start a new history
And trace it back to me
Someday you might see

That I want you
I want you
I want you
Oh I want you

I don't mind
If the sea washes over the city tonight
Tonight

The ground is hollow
The dark skies follow
And you don't know where you've gone

Branches on the trees have arms
The moon is a false alarm
Nothing's gonna do you harm
Except yourself

I want you
I want you
I want you
Yeah I want you

I don't mind
If the sea washes over the city tonight
Tonight

I'm set free
I'm set free
