Sorry sorry for the wait, yeah
Never had a long play, yeah
Not used to showing up
Not used to love
If I know what to cut with
Might mix it up with
Chaos and solitude
Tell me you're in the mood

All the stories, they were lying
End up typical, going for the gold
We don't waste a minute trying
To be anything special

I might be a loser, ooh
You can count on me
Baby, losers are lovers
Come through, ooh
I can prove to you
Baby, losers are lovers

We can take 'em outside, yeah
Suckin' in my low life
All night
I might be a loser, ooh
You can be a loser too
Baby, losers are lovers

Sorry I took so long
I'm a bad deal gone wrong
You're like my halfway house
I'm never moving out
What the fuck is a loser
We'll die in the future
We can die happy now
We can die happy

All the stories, they were lying
End up typical, going for the gold
We don't waste a minute trying
To be anything special

I might be a loser, ooh
You can count on me
Baby, losers are lovers
Come through, ooh
I can prove to you
Baby, losers are lovers

We can take 'em outside, yeah
Suckin' in my low life
All night
I might be a loser, ooh
You can be a loser too
Baby, losers are lovers

Some people are cooler
But I'm more peculiar
And I'll never fool ya
You can, you can count on me
(One, two, three)

I might be a loser, ooh
You can count on me
Baby, losers are lovers
Come through, ooh
I can prove to you
Baby, losers are lovers

We can take 'em outside, yeah
Suckin' in my low life
All night

I might be a loser, ooh
You can be a loser too
Baby, losers are lovers
