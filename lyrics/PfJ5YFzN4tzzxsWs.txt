Do you feel like you just can't take no more?
Broken heart all your pieces on the floor
Like you're running out of breath, tryna find yourself
Before you blow away in the night
Every word you ever said
Every way you ever felt
I know it's hard, but baby tonight

We're gonna run through fire like we've never been burned
We're gonna laugh our life like we've never been hurt
We're gonna shout it out to the edge of the world
You're unbreakable
You're unbreakable
We're gonna scream on rooftops, dance in the rain
We'll open up our heart, yeah forget the pain
And they can call us crazy, freakin' insane
We're unbreakable
We're unbreakable
You're unbreakable
You're unbreakable

Empty streets, filled with faces you don't know
In a crowd tryna stand out, tryna stay low
But no matter where you are it feels like you're in the dark
And you just can't refuse to the light

Every word you ever said
Every way you ever felt
I know it's hard, but baby tonight

We're gonna run through fire like we've never been burned
We're gonna laugh our life like we've never been hurt
We're gonna shout it out to the edge of the world
You're unbreakable
You're unbreakable
We're gonna scream on rooftops, dance in the rain
We'll open up our heart, yeah forget the pain
And they can call us crazy, freakin' insane
We're unbreakable
We're unbreakable
You're unbreakable

I am me
There's nothing that can break me
Nothing that can break me
I'm telling you, I am free
There's nothing that can hold me
Nothing that can hold me
I'm telling you, I am me
There's nothing that can break me
Nothing that can break me
I'm telling you I am free
Can't hold me down!

We're gonna run through fire like we've never been burned
We're gonna laugh our life like we've never been hurt
We're gonna shout it out to the edge of the world
You're unbreakable
You're unbreakable
We're gonna scream on rooftops, dance in the rain
We'll open up our heart, yeah forget the pain
And they can call us crazy, freakin' insane
We're unbreakable
We're unbreakable
You're unbreakable
