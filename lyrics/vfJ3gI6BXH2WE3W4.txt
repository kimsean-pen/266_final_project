It's all kind of a dream
A messed up dream with a messed up theme
In a messed up head
Pass out in bed from too much to drink and not enough to eat
Food for thought. Processes
All the stresses of the world
On my shoulders, on my chest and on my mind, and on my conscience

There's a name for all of this
A shame in all of this
Done watching in disbelief
Done turning the other cheek
Doesn't seem right to me
But maybe this is how it's all supposed to be?

You don't have to be below this
But you don't wanna make things right
(You don't really wanna fix this
You don't really wanna fix this)
You don't have to be alone on this
But you don't wanna make things right
(You don't really wanna fix this)
You don't really wanna fix this

You don't really wanna fix this

Carnivorous, with a significant amount of serious
Oblivious, with a significant amount of indifference
Walls don't always protect from losing respect
From choosing a set, from cursing the name
Laying the blame, on my mind and on my conscience

There's a name for all of this
But maybe this is how it's all supposed to be

You don't have to be below this
But you don't wanna make things right
(You don't really wanna fix this
You don't really wanna fix this)
You don't have to be alone on this
But you don't wanna make things right
(You don't really wanna fix this)
You don't really wanna fix this

You don't really wanna fix this
You don't really wanna fix this

You don't have to be below this
But you don't wanna make things right

You don't have to be below this
But you don't wanna make things right
(You don't really wanna fix this
You don't really wanna fix this)
You don't have to be alone on this
But you don't wanna make things right
(You don't really wanna fix this)
You don't really wanna fix this

You don't have to be
Have to be, have to be, have to be
You don't have to be
Have to be, have to be, have to be
You don't have to be below this
But you don't wanna make things right
