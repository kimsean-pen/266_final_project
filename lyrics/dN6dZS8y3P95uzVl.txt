Access Granted

Boy we been SOS for way too long
I'm 'bout to quit the download
(What you stopping me for, you're holding the door)
Initiate and get it started
It's time to break down the code
(Information in sound, come get it down)
Boy let's take it back to the future
Wanna look in your eyes
Wanna be hypnotized

Fingertips on my skin
Let the chemistry begin
'Cause I'm standing right here and my heart is beating
(Face to face 'cause I want the real thing)
With you by my side
Feel the energy tonight
No digital love 'cause it's got no meaning
(All hung up, hung up on the real thing)
(Real thing, real thing...)
(All hung up, hung up on the real thing)

We're going wireless to reconnect
I want the sound of your voice
(So pick up the phone, y-y-you know my ringtone)
Gonna pull the plug and shut it down
I'm gonna block out the noise
(Let's go underground, where we can be found)

Fingertips on my skin
Let the chemistry begin
'Cause I'm standing right here and my heart is beating
(Face to face 'cause I want the real thing)
With you by my side
Feel the energy tonight
No digital love 'cause it's got no meaning
(All hung up, hung up on the real thing)

5.0 upgraded and we're ready to go
Ready to go
(Real thing...)

Fingertips on my skin
Let the chemistry begin
'Cause I'm standing right here and my heart is beating
(Face to face 'cause I want the real thing)
With you by my side
Feel the energy tonight
No digital love 'cause it's got no meaning
(All hung up, hung up on the real thing)
