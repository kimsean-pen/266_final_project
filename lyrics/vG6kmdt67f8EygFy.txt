I can feel it in my blood
Rotting through my veins
This eternal contagion
Pulsing through my heart, engraved into my brain

My mind will be forever lost in hatred
My mind will be forever lost in hatred

Lies controlling sick minds
Promoting lies
Denying free minds
Lies controlling sick minds
Promoting lies
Denying free minds

Why don't you take my mind
'Cause you already own my life
This eternal contagion
Blindly fall in line, mindlessly shift through time
Their minds have been so wasted

Lies controlling sick minds
Promoting lies
Denying free minds
Lies controlling sick minds
Promoting lies
Denying free minds

My mind will be forever lost in hatred
