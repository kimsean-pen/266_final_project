A Day Will Come When The Souls Are Gone
An Old Man Dies And No One's Born
The Earth Will Be But An Empty Shell
Like The Time Before When The Giants Fell
Like A Limb That Doesn't Know It's Gone
This Embattled Race Will Stagger On
When The Well Of Souls Lies Dry And Bare
The Mother Sleeps Let All Despair

A Time Will Come When We're Forced To Face
What We Have Done Held In Disgrace
Our Place In Time Will Soon Be Gone
In A Wasted Land Dusk Without Dawn
Taking More Than We've To Give
If The Mother Sleeps We Can't Live
When The Well Of Souls Lies Dry And Bare
The Mother Dies Let All Despair

The Wasted Lives And The Wasted Tears
Won't Get Us Back These Wasted Years
The Earth Will Be A Living Hell
Like The Time Before The Angels Fell
We've Taken All That We Can Take
There's Nothing More To Bend Just Break
As The Well Of Souls Lies Dry And Bare
The Mother Dies Let All Despair

All The Loss And All The Pain
Won't Make Our Mother Whole Again
The Earth Will Be A Living Hell
Like The Time Before The Angels Fell
Every Life Linked To Her Soul
This Purging Time Must Take It's Toll
As The Well Of Souls Lies Dry And Bare
The Mother Dies Let All Despair
