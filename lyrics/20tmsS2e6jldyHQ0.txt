I've waited a lifetime to feel the way that I feel now
But I never imagined feels like walking on the clouds
You're the reason I'm here
I'm not moving
I'm not leaving
Can't believe you're the reason that I'm standing right here
I'm not moving
Finally breathing
Can't you see you're the reason that I'm standing right
You drained me of sadness and filled me back up with love
No room left for the madness that once my world was made up of
You're the reason I'm here
I'm not moving
I'm not leaving
Can't believe you're the reason that I'm standing right here
I'm not moving
Finally breathing
Can't you see you're the reason that I'm standing right here
Standing up for what I believe
The reason I'm here
Being the best that you help me be
I promise that I will not let you down
After all
You're the reason that I'm here standing
Oh
Yeah

You're the reason I'm here
I'm not moving
I'm not leaving
Can't believe you're the reason that I'm standing right here
I'm not moving
Finally breathing
Can't you see you're the reason that I'm standing
You're the reason I'm here
I'm not moving
I'm not leaving
Can't believe you're the reason that I'm standing right here
I'm not moving
Finally breathing
Can't you see you're the reason that I'm standing right
