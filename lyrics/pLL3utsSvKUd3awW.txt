I like to party, mm, mm, everybody does
Make luv and listen to the music
You've gotta let yourself go, go, go, go, go, oh

I like to party mm, mm, everybody does
You can be in the weekend of yours
To see what you get into

Make luv and listen to the music
You've gotta let yourself go, go, go, go, go, oh
Make luv and listen to the music
You've gotta let yourself go, go, go, go, go, oh

Make luv and listen to the music
You've gotta let yourself go, go, go, go, go, oh

You've gotta let yourself go, go, go, go, go, oh

You can be in the weekend of yours
To see what you get into

Make luv and listen to the music
You've gotta let yourself go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Make luv and listen to the music
You've gotta let yourself go, go, go, go, go, oh

Gotta get myself, gotta move on up
Make luv until the morning now

Make luv and listen to the music
You've gotta let yourself go, go, go, go, go, oh

Make luv and listen to the music
You've gotta let yourself go, go, go, go, go, oh

Make luv and listen to the music
You've gotta let yourself go, go, go, go, go, oh
