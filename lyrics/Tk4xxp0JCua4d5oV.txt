The price of existence.
Our stagnant bodies bound
in a time of the living.
And nothing's what it's been.

I have drowned in this vague world.
We pretend, but the madness always on deep inside
our sleeping state, where our black thoughts thrive.

I can't be, the only one.
That sees this, that feels the fumes from the motors.
Delusions starts to eat the world as we know
it. Can we ever change ourselves, the strange?

And in myself I feel that I'm always outside the reality.
And inside my fragile me lies the truth concealed.
Hidden deep down in me.

Failure of resistance.
Welcome, the wave of rage.
So far in the distance, but so close in our blood and veins.

I'll fight this sentence.
Nothing's real inside this scope.
I'll fight my condition.
Nothing will ever break or harm, us strange.

Strange.

We're hiding the knifes, scared of what we'll meet.

And in myself I feel that I'm always outside the reality.
And inside my fragile me lies the truth concealed.
Hidden deep down in me.

We'll face them all.
We'll face them all.
We'll take it all.
We'll take it all.

How can I be so afraid of living?
We're the ghosts of this world.

I'm tired of this mess.
I'm tired of thoughts eating myself from the inside out.

I've waited so long and the only thing I know.
No matter how hard I try, I'll never be free.

But nothing seems to ever unfold.
At least my sight calms somewhat.
I'm living this curse and I don't know what to feel inside me now.

The filth, the black has almost swallowed me.
In a time, where the compulsions have start to feast.
I've been drowned by the sickness that's controlling me.
In a time where no-one seems care one bit.

I can't be, the only one.
That sees this, that feels the fumes from the motors.
Delusions starts to eat the world as we know
it. Can we ever change ourselves, the strange?

Strange.

We're hiding the knifes, scared of what we'll meet.
