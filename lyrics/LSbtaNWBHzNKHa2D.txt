You think you know me but you wont believe you eyes
Don't pray to god 'cus you can't make up your mind
all your life in a blackened daze
that's the lie of eternal pain.

I am the child, I am the rumour that be
the biding sound of the living dream
like burning embers from a burning lake
I will burn life and life awaits

You think you know me but you wont believe you eyes
don't pray to go 'cus you cant make up your mind
all you life in a blackened daze
that's the lie of eternal fate
