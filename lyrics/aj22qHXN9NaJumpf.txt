When I see your...

I couldn't be less like you
I like all you like too
I like freedom, you like safety
While I call it free, you call it crazy

You like to say how you feel
I pretend my problems aren't real
But you, you get it out of me
I tell you all my secrets, all my dreams

And somehow it just works
Somehow we just click
You know you have my heart

When I see your...
Blueeeeee eyes
Let me see the whole of you
Nothing is left to hide
Now I see the shade of blue

Feel it watching over me
Hold me in your company
Come feel
What they do
Well I love it too

Oh I could never feel... blue...
Oh I could...
Oh I could never feel... blue...

I like it rough if you like slick
I watch my words, you say them quick
I like champagne but you don't like the taste
So I drink yours cause I don't like to waste

I like it candle, you like boojy
But I like it most when it's just you and me
And I do anything to turn you on
Do as you wish cause you can do no wrong

And somehow it just works
Somehow we just click
You know you have my heart

When I see your...
Blueeeeee eyes
Let me see the whole of you
Nothing is left to hide
Now I see the shade of blue

Feel it watching over me
Hold me in your company
Come feel
What they do
Well I love it too

Oh I could never feel... blue...
Oh I could...
Oh I could never feel... blue...

You're my blue-eyed boy
Tell me how you bring me so much joy
Keep on doing just what you do
Cause I don't need the world, I just need you

You're my blue-eyed guy
Tell me what you do that makes me high
Keep on doing just what you do
Cause I don't need the world, I just need you

Blueeeeee eyes
Let me see the whole of you
Nothing is left to hide
Now I see the shade of blue

Feel it watching over me
Hold me in your company
Come feel
What they do
Well I love it too

I could never feel blue
Looking in your, looking in your...
I could never feel blue
Oh oh oh oh
I could never feel blue
I could never feel blue
I could never feel blue
Looking in your, looking in your...
Blue eyes...
