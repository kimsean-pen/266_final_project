like a virus needs a body
as soft tissue feeds on blood
someday i'll find you — the urge is here
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh

like a mushroom on a tree trunk
as the protein transmutates
i knock on your skin — and i am in
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh

the perfect match — you and me
i adapt — contagious
you open up — say welcome

like a flame that seeks explosives

as gun powder needs a war
i feast inside you — my host is you
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh

the perfect match — you and i
you fail to resist
my crystalline charm

like a virus — patient hunter
i'm waiting for you — i'm starving for you
ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh

my sweet adversary
my sweet adversary
my sweet adversary
