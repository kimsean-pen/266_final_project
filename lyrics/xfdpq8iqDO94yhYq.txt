The soft rains of april are over
The soft rains of april are over, over
Anybody home now
I am on the phone now, please
The soft rains of april are over
The ferry across the water to dover, over
Anybody home now
I am on the phone, oh i'd like to go back
Is it raining back home
I'm so alone
Just got up today
And my thoughts are miles away with you
Well, they gave me four years
Three more to go
Keep writing letters
Time's passing so slow
Time's passing so slow
The soft rains of april are over
The soft rains of april are over
Over
