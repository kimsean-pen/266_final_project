If you wanna leave then just go
Cause I cant get no sun in your shadow
If you aint gonna love me and find me
Then I'm gonna turn the other cheek and go
Go, go, go

Cause I've been hangin on the telephone,
Lines that you always told me
Now I cant let go
I believed in them the last time
You warm me with your words
But now I'm tired and I'm getting cold
So cold

If you wanna leave then just go
Cause I cant get no sun in your shadow
If you aint gonna love me and find me
Then I'm gonna turn the other cheek and go
Go, go, go

Turn the other cheek and go, go, go

Cause every time I push
You hold me just close enough to keep me here

So pull your anchor up
And prepare to show or sail away
If you wanna leave then just go

Cause I've been hangin on the telephone
Lines that you always told me
Now I cant let go
I believed in them the last time
You told me you would try
But boy this is getting old
So old

If you wanna leave then just go
Cause I cant get no sun in your shadow
If you aint gonna love me and find me
Then I'm gonna turn the other cheek and go, go, go

Turn the other cheek and go, go, go

I'm better off alone
I'm better off alone
