I never knew true love
never felt this feeling smiles

And you filled me up
you're my heart's religion

I don't have anything without you baby
don't you know
I'll keep you close to me forever never let you go

Because you've got it
everything I've ever wanted
you're the only thing that's solid
I was nothing till you made that clear

So when you're broken hearted
promise I won't leave you hardened
think about the world we started
You know I'm gonna be right here

Everyday everyday everyday
everyday everyday everyday
everyday everyday everyday
everyday everyday everyday

I think my heart wants me dead
everyday everyday everyday
everyday everyday everyday
everyday everyday everyday

I think my heart wants me dead

You came and lit this fire
I never knew was inside me

You made me burn so bright
when our stars collided

I don't have anything without you
baby don't you know
I'll keep you close to me forever never let you go

Because you've got it
everything I've ever wanted
you're the only thing that's solid
I was nothing till you made that clear

So when you're broken hearted
promise I won't leave you hardened
think about the world we started
You know I'm gonna be right here

Everyday everyday everyday
everyday everyday everyday
everyday everyday everyday
everyday everyday everyday

I think my heart wants me dead
Noooooow

I think my heart wants me dead
everyday everyday everyday
everyday everyday everyday
everyday everyday everyday

Because you've got it
everything I've ever wanted
you're the only thing that's solid
I was nothing till you made that clear

So when you're broken hearted
promise it won't leave you hardened
think about the world we started
you know Im gonna be right here

I think my heart wants me dead
I think my heart wants me dead
I think my heart wants me dead
