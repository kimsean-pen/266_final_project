Tell me, tell me,
Is life just a playground?
Think you're the real deal, Honey?
And someone will always look out for you?

But wake up, Baby,
You're so totally deluded
You'll end up old and lonely,
If you don't get a bullet in your head

Good luck, good luck,
Good luck in your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares, Honey,
When you're resting your head

Good luck, good luck,
Good luck in your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares, Honey,
When you're resting your head

You sold me, sold me,
You sold me down the river now
I hope you're feeling happy now,
Now you always have a sneer in your smile

But wake up, Baby,
You're so totally deluded
You'll end up old and lonely,
If you don't get a bullet in your head

Good luck, good luck,
Good luck in your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares, Honey,
When you're resting your head

Good luck, good luck,
Good luck in your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares, Honey,
When you're resting your head

And I'm glad, so glad, that I'm done with you
No more crying, crying leaving me so black & blue
You backed me up against the wall,
But I stand tall, don't give a damn no more
Oh, Baby, bye bye

No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
Without you

Good good luck,
In your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares,
When you resting your head

Good good luck,
In your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares

Good luck, good luck,
Good luck in your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares, Honey,
When you're resting your head

Good luck, good luck,
Good luck in your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares, Honey,
When you're resting your head

Good luck, good luck, (Good luck)
Good luck in your new bed (Good luck)
Enjoy your nightmares, Honey, (Good luck)
When you're resting your head (Good luck)

Good luck, good luck, (Good luck)
Good luck in your new bed (Good luck)
Enjoy your nightmares, Honey, (Good luck)
When you're resting your head (Good luck)

Good good luck,
In your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares,
When you resting your head

Good good luck,
In your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares
