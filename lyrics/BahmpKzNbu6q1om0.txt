I've had enough of all this tension
Don't you know I'm worried sick
Now i'm in the right dimension
No escape route does the trick

I hear my heart is on rotation
As other people take their cut
And I can't bear to stand and witness
So I'll just keep my wide eyes shut

Let it go before it kills you
Let it fall and fade away
Let's have fun and do what thrills you
Please don't waste another day

Why do I cause myself this trouble
When all around me things are good
If you could look into the future
Maybe I'd be understood

Let it go before it kills you
Let it fall and fade away
Let it go let it fall let it fade away
Let's have fun and do what thrills you
Please don't waste another day

You know I love you more than money
You know I need you more than fame
And I'll be there for the children
And I will never pass the blame

Let it go before it kills you
Let it fall and fade away
Let it go let it fall let it fade away
Let's have fun and do what thrills you
Please don't waste another day

Sample
Anyway, it's hot here, it's hot.
That's all I gotta say.
Florida's hot.
There's hurricanes and it's hot.
There's thugs... and muggers,
And... fourteen year old kids on bikes with guns.
Come on over sometime!
