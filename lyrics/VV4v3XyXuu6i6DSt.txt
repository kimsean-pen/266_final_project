I heard all about you
Once upon a jet-lagged cruise
And jewelry in between his palms
How's it make you hurt?
All you do is sulk like there's nothing wrong

I know all about you
(Not quite enough)
Once upon a bright blue moon
(Swells like the tide inside)
And jewelry in between my fold
This is all I need
I want you to hold until we get cold
(Please, don't cry)

I've heard all about her
(Not quite enough)
Once upon a bold, brash slur
(Swells like the tide inside)
She fell deep beneath the floor
Close below my feet
Who knew she would seek something furthermore?

They heard all about us
(Not quite enough)
Once upon a bold, brash slur
(Swells like the tide inside)
And now he hopes to find a means
Somewhere in his dreams
But death is all he sees, death is all he sees
(Don't cry)

The look on my face
Scares them away
Miss Glum, why'd you leave me like that?
The look on my face
Scares them away
Miss Glum, why'd you leave me like that?
You can't earn my love
I can't earn my love
Miss Glum, why'd you leave me like that?
You can't earn my love
I can't earn my love
Miss Glum, why'd you leave me like that?
