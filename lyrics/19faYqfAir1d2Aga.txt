Primeval Fear

The sun is dead now
And all that godly eyes could ever see
The image of the world is fading
Storms and chaos there will forever be

Sepulchral voice of darkness
The daemon rise with grotesque eyes
Divine madness will prevail
The archenemy has risen

Primeval fear

I am thy mouth madness
Lurking within the shadows of the human soul
I am thy sepulchral voice of darkness
The daemon who has risen

Human - where is your god now?
As primeval fear impaled your spirit
Human - die by your own hands
Cause mankind is now forlorn

The archenemy has risen
The world is chaos
Prime evil fear
