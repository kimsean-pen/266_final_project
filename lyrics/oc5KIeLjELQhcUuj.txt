Midnight
That is the only time I let myself think of you
Daylight
Makes it too clear what I know now to be true

I would love you, even if you didn't want me to
I can do it all by myself yeah
I would love you, even if you don't need me to
I can do it all by myself, yeah

You say, "I gotta go, my love"
I would never know who I am
If I stay here not beside you
Even if that is what I wanna do
I gotta get on

I would love you even if I you didn't want me to
I can do it all by myself, yeah
I would love you, even if you don't need me to
I can do it all by myself, yeah

(woo!)

You, you are grown
You, you are grown
You, you are grown
You, you are grown

Woahhhhuhh
Woahhhhuhh
Woahhhhuhh
