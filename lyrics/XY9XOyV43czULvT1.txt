Hey sister why you all alone?
I'm standing out your window
Hey little sister, can I come inside, dear?

I wanna show you all my love
I wanna be the only one
I know you like nobody ever, baby

Little sister can't you find another way
No more livin' life behind the shadow
Little sister can't you find another way
No more livin' life behind the shadow

You whisper secrets in my ear
Slowly dancing cheek to cheek
Such a sweet thing when you open up, baby
They say I'll only do you wrong
We come together 'cause I

Understand
Just who you really are, yeah baby
Little sister can't you find another way
No more livin' life behind the shadow
Little sister can't you find another way
No more livin' life behind the shadow
Shake it up
