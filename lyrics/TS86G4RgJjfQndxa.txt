Left alone
With what I have become
Close my eyes
Kingdoms fall around me
Crowned with scorn
A heavy cross to bear
Turn away

I was never strong enough
To face what I left behind
Seeking comfort in anything
That could distract my troubled mind
The snow fell once again
Guiding my journey's end
In solitude and twisted steel
Haunted by the grief that I still feel

Against an endless horizon
The fire seemed to burn forever
Another day smoulders into night
Alone, I travel on

Finally at peace in frozen isolation
Where nothing dwells, but the spirits of my past

This decision would haunt my life
In the silence where all light dies
And as the seasons began to change
Revealing all that winter claimed
Beneath the frost, in endless sleep
A lonesome death for all to see
Preserving where my failures led me

Against an endless horizon
The fire seemed to burn forever
Another day smoulders into night
Alone, I travel on
