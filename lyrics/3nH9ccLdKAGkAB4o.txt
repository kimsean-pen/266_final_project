Spoken: Headphones?

If you'd let me Uri
This is a so called true story
We had the time of our lives
Stirrin' up clouds of scandal
Freedom, the ultimate freedom,
Then the bombshell hit
A fiasco!
Who, who's exploiting who?
I just don't know who who who
Who's exploiting who?

Never underestimate,
Creative people and the depths that they will go
Don't leave this,
Cruising at higher speed
Ain't that a feeling you and I know well
So let the sparks fly
You and I glide
Ticking like a time bomb
'till I receive your reply

Who, who's exploiting who?
Won't you tell me who who who?
Who's exploiting who?
I just don't know who
Who's exploiting who?
Won't you tell me who who who?
Who's exploiting who?
I just don't know who

You're losing your aura of invincibility
And your self-effacing modesty
Should we leave the money and run?
You son of a gun
Or we could go down fighting
Who's exploiting who?

Who, who's exploiting who?
Won't you tell me who who?
Who's exploiting who?
I just don't know who
(I don't see it as amusing)
Who's exploiting who?
(The press is a prey)
I just don't know who who who
Who's exploiting who?
(Don't believe in it)
Who?
(I don't have the luxury)
Who's exploiting who?
(Assumptions are part of the question)
I just don't know who who
Who's exploiting who?
(How??? do you??? I)
I just don't know who,
Who's exploiting who?
(The pleasure is all ours)
Won't you tell me who who who?
Who's exploiting who?

Who?
