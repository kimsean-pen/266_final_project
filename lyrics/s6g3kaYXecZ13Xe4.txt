The summer's over
This town is closin'
They're waving people
Out of the ocean
We had the feeling
Like we were floating
We never noticed
Where time was going

But just remember on the way home
Ooo-o-ooooo...
That you were never meant to feel alone

Do you remember
When we first got here?
The days were longer
The nights were hot here
Now it's September
The engine's started
You're empty-handed
And heavy-hearted

But just remember on the way home
Ooo-o-ooooo...
That you were never meant to feel alone
