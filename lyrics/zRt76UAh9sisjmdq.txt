I've heard people say that
Too much of anything is not good for you baby
But I don't know about that
As many times as we've loved and
We've shared love and made love
It doesn't seem to me like it's enough
It's just not enough, no
It's just not enough, oh babe

My darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe

Oh, some things I can't get used to, no matter how I try
It's like the more you give, the more I want
And baby, that's no lie, oh no, babe

Tell me, what can I say, what am I gonna do?
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that you're givin' me
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?

Girl, all I know is every time you're near
I feel the change, something movin'
I scream your name, look what you got me doin'

Darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe, oh no, babe
Girl, if I could only make you see and make you understand
Girl, your love for me is all I need
And more than I can stand, oh well, babe

How can I explain all the things I feel?
You've given me so much, girl, you're so unreal
Still, I keep loving you, more and more each time
Girl, what am I gonna do 'cause you blow my mind

I get the same old feeling every time you're here
I feel the change, something moves
I scream your name, look what you got me doing

Darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe, oh no babe
Baby it didn't take all of my life to find you
But you can believe it's gonna take the rest of my life to keep you

Oh no babe

Oh my darling I can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
Can't get enough of your love, babe

Oh my darling I can't get enough of your love, babe, oh babe
Girl I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe
Darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
