Then you wake...

Another body bag, pathetic
Picture frame obituary faded in the attic
A shadow of someone you used to be
You've seen so many in these flames
And swore that you'd never become the clich√©
A long forgotten memory

And when you wake...
Everything you ever wanted
Everything you never had
Everything learned forgotten and dead
Everything turns to nothing

Another day, a little dirt for the grave
Is it worth everything that you gave
What a beautiful way to waste away
Consumed by dependency
A lesson in despondency
A long forgotten memory

And when you wake...
Everything you ever wanted
Everything you never had
Everything learned forgotten and dead
Everything turns to nothing

And then you wake...
And then you wake...

How quickly the master
Turns into the slave
Slowly succumbing more
Every dying day

Everything you ever wanted
Everything you never had
Everything learned forgotten and dead
Everything turns to nothing
Everything turns to nothing
Everything turns to nothing
