You are like a sunset
Behind the mountain
Somewhere
And when
I cannot see you
I know You're
still here

Because my heart is yours
I'll never leave you
Though we are far apart
I'm by your side
My love is never gone
I feel it rise again
Through it all
Now my heart is yours

You say
I am the moonlight
I watch you, at night
And when
You cannot see me
I'm still there
In the sky

Because my heart is yours
I'll never leave you
Though we are far apart
I'm by your side
My love is never gone
I feel it rise again
Through it all
Now my heart is yours

Because my heart is yours
I'll never leave you
Though we are far apart
I'm by your side
My love is never gone
I feel it rise again
Through it all
Now my heart is yours
