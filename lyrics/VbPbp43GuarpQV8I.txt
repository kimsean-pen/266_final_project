I wanna make it right
I wanna make you cry

I follow soon, I follow soon
I follow soon, I follow
I follow soon, I follow soon
I follow soon, I follow

Stop swaying when the moon is shaking thou
Makes mama throw her hands and flip around
Back lashing with a bullet full of love
Makes papa wanna crawl up his old truck

Stop swaying when the moon is shaking thou
Makes mama throw her hands and flip around
Back lashing with a bullet full of love
Makes papa wanna crawl up his old truck

Stop swaying when the moon is shaking thou
Makes mama throw her hands and flip around
Back lashing with a bullet full of love
Makes papa wanna crawl up his old truck

Stop swaying when the moon is shaking thou
Makes mama throw her hands and flip around
Back lashing with a bullet full of love
Makes papa wanna crawl up his old truck

Stop swaying when the moon is shaking thou
Makes mama throw her hands and flip around

Makes papa wanna crawl up his old truck

I follow soon, I follow soon
I follow soon, I follow
I follow soon, I follow soon
I follow soon, I follow

I follow soon, I follow soon
I follow soon, I follow

I follow soon, I follow soon
I follow soon, I follow
o-oh
