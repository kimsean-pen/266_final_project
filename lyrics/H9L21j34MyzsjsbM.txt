Nothing more to say
And nothing more to do
The city is heating up
And all the kids are leaving school

Trying to keep my cool
I know you're trying to keep yours too
But summer makes the fool
Of every heart it wishes to

And I need you more and more
As the days go on
I need you more and more

I heard when you said: Don't fall
The summer never hurries along
Oh you said: Don't fall
I heard when you said: Don't fall
The summer never hurries along
Oh you said: Don't fall

It's hard enough to stay
When all my friends have gone away
And everything is clear
I don't know what I'm doing here

I try to let you know
I don't want to let you go
If there's nothing I can give
Just cut the cord and fly with it

But I need you more and more
As the days go on
I need you more and more

I heard when you said: Don't fall
The summer never hurries along
Oh you said: Don't fall
I heard when you said: Don't fall
The summer never hurries along
Oh you said: Don't fall

I heard when you said: Don't fall
I heard when you said: Don't fall
I heard when you said: Don't fall
I heard when you said: Don't fall
