A million things
I want to say
but I shield my face
and turn away
swallowing my words
silenced by shame.

A million tears
I want to cry
but I shield my face
and dry my eyes
swallowing my hurt
breaking inside

Please stay here with me.

Just hold me as I bleed myself dry.

See straight into me.

Just look beyond the tears in my eyes.

A million things
wish you would say
even if I fall
that you will stay
and none of my flaws
can turn you away.

Please stay here with me.

Just hold me as I bleed myself dry.

See straight into me.

Just look beyond the tears in my eyes.

Like a circle around me.
As the prison of this boundary
I need a storm to break it down.
shield your eyes from the fire light.
But please don't turn away from my side.
I am not that - which I fight.

Every tear I cry
burns away through my eyes
where I can see through my lies.

Every tear I cry
makes trails in the ice
where I am warm inside.
See straight into me.
Just look beyond the tears in my eyes.
Please stay here with me.
Just hold me as I bleed myself dry.
See straight into me.
Just look beyond the tears in my eyes.
Please stay here with me.
Just hold me as I bleed myself dry.
See straight into me.
Just look beyond the tears in my eyes.
