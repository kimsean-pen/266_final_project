Baby girl, you are real
The first truth that I've ever had
You always know when I'm sad
You give, you give
You always call me on my shit

Baby girl, you are real
You talk like it's a screaming match
You always fucking drown me out
You know, but you know
You know you're never alone

How I want, how I want
To see you happy
How I want, how I want
To see you smile

Baby girl, dark of night
How you glitter in the camera lens
No one else could wear that dress quite right
No one else could wear that dress quite right

How I want, how I want
To see you happy
How I want, how I want
To see you smile

Oh, lying on the bathroom floor
Laughing our head off
Oh, crying in the alleyway
Your head in my lap

How I want, how I want
To see you happy
How I want, how I want
To see you smile

Oh, lying on the bathroom floor
Laughing our head off
Oh, crying in the alleyway
Your head in my lap
