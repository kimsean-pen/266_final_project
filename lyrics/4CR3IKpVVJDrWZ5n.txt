Take off my black lace with your teeth
Tonight, my baby's getting everything because

I'll fall in lust
He don't know the proper time to leave

Baby wants to go out
After hours, I'm sure
If you know me but now
You know nothing at all

Baby wants to go out
After hours, I'm sure
Street lights flickering down
Hotel close the door
after hours
Your skin
Bathed in neon up lights
Oh, I don't
Ever want you out of my sight

Because I fall in lust
He don't know the proper time to leave

Baby wants to go out
After hours, I'm sure
Street lights flickering down
Hotel close the door

Baby wants to go out
After hours, I'm sure
If you know me but now
You know nothing at all

Baby wants to go out
After hours, I'm sure
Street lights flickering down
Hotel close the door

Baby wants to go out
After hours, I'm sure
If you know me but now
You know nothing at all

Baby wants to go out
After hours, I'm sure
Street lights flickering down
Hotel close the door

After hours

(Ohhh)
Woo baby wants to go out
