The face of another day
Searching for the voice of a better way
They say that it's a bad time of year to be up in arms
So we're pushing on cause we know in our hearts

It's the only way
To stay afloat with the sharks at bay
Avoid being a casualty of the circumstances
And second chances are shredded day by day
Will your legs fail you
When you stand too straight and tall
'Cause the world's gone mad
The taller you are, the harder you fall

Sail up into the night sky
Until our worlds collide
Tonight we feel alive
Stand up where I can see you
No reason left to hide
Tonight we feel alive

You asked, what would I stand for
Truth is I stand for this
It's passion perfected
Fashion neglected
A natural infection of all we have seen

It's the only way
Since we discovered we had a say
Found that the world's not as cold and grey
As our circumstances
And second chances living out the days
Will your legs fail you
When you stand too straight and tall
Cause the world's gone mad

The taller you are, the harder you fall
I won't stand for this

Sail up into the night sky
Until our worlds collide
Tonight we feel alive
Stand up where I can see you
No reason left to hide
Tonight we feel alive
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Stand up where I can see you
No reason left to hide
It's the only way
It's the only way
Tonight we feel alive
It's the only way
It's the only way
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Will your legs fail you
When you stand too straight and tall
Cause the world's gone mad
The taller you are, the harder you fall

Sail up into the night sky
Until our worlds collide
Tonight we feel alive
Stand up where I can see you
No reason left to hide
Tonight we feel alive
Tonight we feel alive
Tonight, tonight, tonight
