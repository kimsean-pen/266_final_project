Oh no, we're charming
Oh no, self harming

We range the view, we do
Dead will fall, no ones bothered
You're trapped, me too
Alienation, no ones bothered
No ones bothered

Two carriage on the run out, everybody shake
I got a bleedy strop on I'll tell ya mate
I might get, I'm don at everything I seen
The grass in the dugout always bleeds
Mate, victory for no one, hates as much as bleeds
The dark through the go on dead up from the knees
And hip shake, shake it, I been around
The grass in the dug out

We range the view, we do
Dead will fall, no ones bothered
You're trapped, me too
Alienation, no ones bothered
No ones bothered

Bit tangy I got spun out
Who makes it all it seems
Hot sauce make out spicy screams
Hello'er grass skirt, five-O
Steve Mcgarrett, he blew all of the dough

We range the view, we do
Dead will fall, no ones bothered
You're trapped, me too
Alienation, no ones bothered
No ones bothered
No ones bothered
No ones bothered
No ones bothered
We range the view, we do
Dead will fall, no ones bothered
You're trapped, me too
Alienation, no ones bothered
No ones bothered
No ones bothered
No one

Oh no, we're charming
Oh no, self harming

I take it back
I take it down
I take it back
I take it down
I take it down
I take it down
I take it down
I take it down

No ones bothered
No ones bothered
No ones bothered
No ones bothered
