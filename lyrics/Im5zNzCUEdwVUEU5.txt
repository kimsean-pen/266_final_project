Suppose the world was not informed
By real estate or power lines?
The hidden river of my life
Pursued by love
The whispering stone, the valley ford
The candy corn, the spirit finds
Abuse has left me on my side
A single stone

I'm a walker, I'm a dreamer
Treehouse greeter, Pentecostal preacher
I'm a walker, yeah I'm a schemer
Composed preacher, pioneer believer

A small betrayal
A simple thought to shrug it off, unoccupied
The precious lake, the riverbed, the rising tide
The sad surprise, the day it feds
The flooding falls, the cliff or chime
Awake my soul, awake my heart and you will find

I'm a walker, I'm a drinker
Safeway shopper, thunder a greeter
I'm a biker, yeah, I'm a beaver
Wet foot walker, trailblazing fever
I'm a lover, yeah, I'm a weeper
Subaru driver, satellite receiver
I'm a trucker, yeah, I'm a chaser
Chasing for a rider, I'm a Nike racer
