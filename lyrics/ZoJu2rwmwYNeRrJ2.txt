None of it seems to matter
Now that you're not laying next to me
Baby it's the morning after
I miss your smile
As the sun creeps in
I know I'm the one that those this
But it's still hard to try and let you go
I swear I feel your fingertips
Pulling me right on home
Tell me
What am I going to do?
To stop myself from running back to you
Please tell me
What am I going to do?
To stop myself from running back to you
To stop myself from running back to you
Running back to you x6
Funny how life continues
The heart repairs
The mind it learns to breathe
I can go on without you
And baby you can do it without me
But still I have these moments
Where I forget that we're not us no more
I type your name then close it
Remember that I walked out that door
Tell me
What am I going to do?
To stop myself from running back to you
Please tell me
What am I going to do?
To stop myself from running back to you
To stop myself from running back to you
Running back to you x6
Tell me when will it stop
Can my feet quit hitting the pavement
No more tears to fall
My well is running dry
And I'm starting to notice
The smell of your skin isn't lingering
Can't stop my self from ru running
Back to you
Running back to you
