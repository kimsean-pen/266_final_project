This is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach

Your's is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
Now I don't know where I am
Don't know where I've been

But I know where I want to go
And so I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow

But I realized that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home
Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning

And I thought it was strange
You said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And you said, "This is the first day of my life

I'm glad I didn't die before I met you
But, now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy"
So if you wanna be with me

With these things there's no telling
We'll just have to wait and see
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery
Besides, maybe this time it's different
I mean I really think you like me, me, me, me
