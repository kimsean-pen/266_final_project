You know I can over analyze
Things when I don't need to
And you always remind me
That it doesn't have to be like this
But it's a lot to take
When every day there's new distractions
It doesn't have to feel like this
You know I'm tired of saying what I think I need to say
And even though you aren't always sweet
You are all that's sweet at all to me

I got a little bit tired of spending all morning
Really wishing that I was still sleeping
But you and me being each other
Feels like it's all I ever needed
Now all I can hear is rhythm and melody in my ears
It sounds like it feels
All the time now I'm balancing perfectly
In between awake and a dream

Subtly moving around my eyes
The electricity traveling up my spine
Now there's a heat in my chest and ringing in my ears
I can't explain this new sensation
It kind of feels like falling
But what's underneath me's soft as velvet and I'm fading
Into the expanding of my chest
Moving with the rhythm of my breath

I got a little bit tired of spending all morning
Really wishing that I was still sleeping
But you and me being each other
Feels like it's all I ever needed
Now all I can hear is rhythm and melody in my ears
It sounds like it feels
All the time now I'm balancing perfectly
In between awake and a dream

Doesn't have to be like this
But it's a lot to take
When every day there's new distractions
It kind of feels like falling
But what's underneath me's soft as velvet and I'm fading

I got a little bit tired of spending all morning
Really wishing that I was still sleeping
But you and me being each other
Feels like it's all I ever needed
Now all I can hear is rhythm and melody in my ears
It sounds like it feels
All the time now I'm balancing perfectly
In between awake and a dream
