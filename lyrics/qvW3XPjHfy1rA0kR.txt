I never told you that
I wanted this to go this way
I never told you why
You shouldn't believe what my dull eyes say

So I spun around
And fell off off off to the ground
I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I never told myself for what reason
I stopped to live
I just lie to myself

So I spun around
And fell off off off to the ground
I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I never told myself for what reason
I stopped to live
I just wanna be in your head
I just wanna be in you bed

So I spun around
And fell off off off to the ground
I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Fiction
Get me before I leave
Your opinion is mine

It is a bliss, could I ever be
You're an abyss
And I lay down

Fiction all the time
Go to sleep
You're all diseased again

I know, so I go again
And the sound
Will sweep you off your feet
My friend

It is a bliss, could I ever be
You're an abyss
And I lay down

Fiction all the time
Go to sleep
You're all diseased again
Fiction all the time
Go to sleep
You're all diseased again
