We were born into fool's world
And we will die before we play the game
So many blows ripping apart our gentle souls
And l shudder, 'cause I know what I don't want to know

And its kill me killing me laughter
Wanna wash those smiles away
Oh kill me killing me slowly
Wanna wash those smiles away

I walk with the noise
It's reaching out of me
I talk to the walls
Face my devils
When I'm losing my touch - the terror, the terror
I walk with the noise
Face my devils

Propaganda is in our flesh and blood
And we rejoice in the control of others
Euphoria â€“ poisoning the minds of the future
And it is turning our kids to murder, to murder.

And its kill me killing me laughter
Wanna wash those smiles away
Oh kill me killing me slowly
Wanna wash those smiles away

I walk with the noise
It's reaching out of me
I talk to the walls
Face my devils
When I'm losing my touch - the terror, the terror
I walk with the noise
Face my devils
