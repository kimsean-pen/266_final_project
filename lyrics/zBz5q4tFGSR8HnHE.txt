Lost inside the garden of eden eating my pride
Sleep deprived every evening I'm sleeping beneath the stars
Beat the odds, let em see all the scars secrets and all
Follow heart til they feed on my carcass we could be gods
Singing songs for the elegy I can still hear the melodies
People wrapped up in cellophane moonlight cuts through the ebony
Spinal column still shivering lately it's like a centipede
Crawling across the desert I'm hollower now than ever
All the trees are neon I see while I dream I'm free
And I'm beyond the reach of reason to be or just not to be?
I feel empty when you're not with me I've seen all the scenery
Out to sea on a piece you left me I'm ready to sink beneath
In LA it's been raining all day I'm paper mache and wallpaper
Heart is a broken fish-tank my limbs are just vacant hallways
You wander for your escape and I'll still mistake it for always
The long days of this malaise made me patient amidst the cobwebs
Mister melancholy calling turned holidays into hollow days
While I went from flower to flower looking to pollinate
We're far away and wallow we wanted to walk on water
Take all of the autumn sorrows and watch em dissolve away
The weight I wake up to accumulates all my thoughts are so cumulus
All our energy's nuclear you look into my nucleus
Tell me I'm too lugubrious beautiful views elusive
We planted our darkest secrets they're blooming into petunias
Pent up pendulum pulsing just like a metronome
Poisoned, mourning my mornings impulsive
Smelling the petrichor sepulcher head
I'm better off dead the weather is never enough
When effervescent second efforts get me left in the mud
Just up above us is a galaxy grounds all crumble below me
A thousand people surround us inside of me's only lonely
The fireflies used to visit to sit on my skin I miss it
When mystery dissipated you drifted into the distance
