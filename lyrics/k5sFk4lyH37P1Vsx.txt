What are you waiting for?
When everything is said and done
So looking for answers if only one

We come un...

We come un...

What are you waiting for?
Just surrender here tonight
What are you waiting for?
As we go towards the light

When everything is said and done
So looking for answers if only one
Turn my back the urge has gone
Left with no reason, we come undone

We come un...

We come un...

What are you waiting for?

When everything is said and done
So looking for answers if only one
Turn my back the urge has gone
Left with no reason, we come undone
