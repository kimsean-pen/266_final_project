Ain't trying to talk about love,
Ain't trying to talk about lust
Even though these sands of time won't let me let you go
This current ain't for us
Pulling all our trust
Riding waves, ain't tryna let you go

This love can't keep me waiting
This love is far from faded
I see this jaded situation through these sheets of rain and
You always keep me waiting
Love's kind and I ain't patient

Seattle tideZ
Seattle tideZ

This storm isn't letting up
The currents too strong for us
All that I need is you
It's pulling me out too far
Now all I got left is stars

Seattle tideZ

Seattle tideZ
So say goodbye
To this oceanside
Just wait till I

Seattle tideZ
No love can rise
Just say goodbye
Love pulling

That moon is losing its touch
Trying to see the light,
it's nowhere in the sky tonight
We riding on them boards

This love can't keep me waiting
This love is far from faded
I see this jaded situation through these sheets of rain and,
You always keep me waiting
Love's kind and I ain't patient

Seattle tideZ
Seattle tideZ

This storm isn't letting up
The currents too strong for us
All that I need is you
It's pulling me out too far,
Now all I got left is stars

Seattle tideZ

Seattle tideZ
So say goodbye
To this oceanside
Just wait till I

Seattle tideZ
No love can rise
Just say goodbye
Love pulling

Seattle tideZ

Seattle tideZ
So say goodbye
To this oceanside
Just wait till I

Seattle tideZ
No love can rise
Just say goodbye
Love pulling
