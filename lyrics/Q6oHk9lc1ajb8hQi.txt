Was it logical lusting after fame
When ambition had never ended well for us?
Now everything that you lost is surely coming to you
Every catastrophe has shaped me into something new
Just don't get carried away
Making those same mistakes
I know my limit but I'll push
Yeah I'll push it good

I'll give em a hold and a break to breathe
(never forget who picks you up when you fall)
And if they can't play nice I won't play with em at all
I'll give them a kick when I learn to lead
(you're getting over your head once again)
And if they don't get out, Then I'll just bury them all

I swear my motive can still remain sincere
And I can remedy all who've wronged before me
Now everyone that you lost would come back Crying to you
Abandoned memories of family trees I've buried too deep
Just don't get carried away making those same mistakes
I know my limit but I'll push, yeah I'll push it Good

I'll give em a hold and a break to breathe
(never forget who picks you up When you fall)
And if they can't play nice I won't play with em at all
I'll give them a Kick when I learn to lead
(you're getting over your head once again)
And if they don't Get out, then I'll just bury them all

Will you carry us to Eden
Someone to believe in
Breaking down the walls which kept us locked away
Lead us into brilliance
Born by your resilience
Love us all in spite of what we'll do to you

I knew that I did this for a reason

Will you carry us to Eden
Someone to believe in
Breaking down the walls which kept us locked away
Lead us into brilliance
Born by your resilience
Love us all in spite of what we'll do to you
