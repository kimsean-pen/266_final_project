Came here for nothing
Came here for nothing
Now you're gone
Oh I'm better off alone
I was picking up the pieces
Trying to iron out the creases
When you got up and left me here
You tried so hard to disappear

I could have told you
I don't have the strength to hold to
But I'll take your weight
I'll take your company and your hate
Do you remember
I tried to put myself together
But you couldn't take the notion
You came in like an ocean

[Chorus]
And you left me crawling
On my bedroom floor
I tried so hard
But you still wanted more
I couldn't let you drown
So I let you drift away
You're tearing me apart
Because you didn't have the guts to stay

I was fighting for my sanity
While you fought for what was left of me
I couldn't find the best part of my mind
'cause you crumpled up my brain
Driving me insane
Nothing feels the same
I'm falling down like rain

And you left me crawling
On my bedroom floor
I tried so hard
But you still wanted more
I couldn't let you drown
So I let you drift away
You're tearing me apart
Because you didn't have the guts to stay

And you left me crawling
On my bedroom floor
I tried so hard
But you still wanted more
I couldn't let you drown
So I let you drift away
You're tearing me apart
Because you didn't have the guts to

I Came here for nothing
I Came here for nothing
Now you're gone
I Came here for nothing
I Came here for nothing
Now you're gone
I Came here for nothing
I Came here for nothing
