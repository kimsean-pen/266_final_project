Maria marie you're on my mind
You took my heart / you took my time
Maria Marie you're in decline
Look in the mirror see the lines
Maria Marie you're cool as ice
Maria Marie it's in you're eyes
Maria Marie take my advice

Please stop calling me at night
I can't sleep with you outside
I don't want another fight
It's no wonder that you still don't know me

Maria Marie you're so unkind
I guess you are no friend of mine
Maria Marie you're just a sign
Of days gone past and former times
Maria Marie you're on my mind
You took my heart you took my time
Maria Marie you're cool as ice
