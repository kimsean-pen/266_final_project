'Cause I take fear in those who love me
Low lighting with a gated entry
Level headed 'cause I'm stressing
But I stay unsettled never wanted blessing(s)

So I don't wanna be loved
No I don't wanna be loved
And I don't wanna make up
No I don't wanna make up

Short sighted for the lies I told you
But you stood tall 'till the glass was empty
And your low key in the face of limelight
And you wanna be who you are when it really counts most

So I don't wanna be loved
No I don't wanna be loved
And I don't wanna make up
No I don't wanna make up

Lived good true Hollywood story highways chasing washed up glory
Risk it wall no need to be a martyr paradise couldn't get much harder
Ego is all baggage that I need
There no pressure for the ones that you really love
