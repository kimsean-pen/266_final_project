The fiends have gagged a generation of pacified fools
bound by our greed a nation enslaved as corporate tools.
arise and race the legacy of their lies
to realize that this in itself is an ascension
towards the day we revolt.
as the seeds you've cast away take hold
war will be born.
rejoice, the age of the fall has begun
we'll dance as the palaces burn.
a shot gun blast into the face of deceit
you'll gain your just reward.
we'll not rest until the purge is complete
you will reap what you've sown.
my redemption lies in your demise.
in such a world as this does one dare to think for himself?
the paradox of power and peace will destroy itself
to know the truth and live in fear of no man.
to realize that this in itself is an ascension
toward the day we revolt.
as the seeds you've cast away take hold
war will be born.
rejoice, the age of the fall has begun
we'll dance as the palaces burn.
my redemption lies in your demise.
rejoice, the age of the fall has begun.
we'll dance as the palaces burn
