I've been young
I've been old
I've been hurt
and consoled
Heart of coal
Heart of gold
So I'm told

I've been lost
I've been found
I've been taken
by the sound
My own worries
and voices in my head

I can't help it if I fall
In love with you again
I'm calling just to let you know
It dawned on me

Every night
Is a test
To the east
From the west
The sun rises
And it sets
As the sun
At its best

I forget
That I know
I regret
Letting you go
Sometimes
I can't believe
How dark it can be

But I can't help it if I fall
In love with you again
I'm calling just to let you know
It dawned on me
Dawned on me

So far
And so forth
And again
I will stop
To begin
at the end

I can't help it if I fall
In love with you again
I'm calling just to let you know
It dawned on me

I can't help it if I fall
In love with you again
I'm calling just to let you know
It dawned on me
