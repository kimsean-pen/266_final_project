I know it all too well
Always a-coming back
Should find the ways to tell
I'm walking the very same track

I want it different now
I want a way to face it
'Cause in a way somehow
It feels like so much time wasted

Next time just pull the trigger
No dragging me around
Don't make it any bigger
When the fire has burned out

And next man who's in line
Better knows what lies behind
That kind of smile of yours
Is everything as it runs its course
Baby, where is your remorse?

Whatchu doin'
Girl, you're overstepping it quite a lot
If that's what you reap, then
Then I must have been mistaken a lot

Your grip was firm
But you did find a way to lose what you got
It's not up to me to
Let you know what is right, what is not

In between loving me and some cheap thrill
Your thrill didn't come cheap
But what you've sown, you gotta reap
A situation that you can't control
A situation that gets onto your very soul

I'm not against it
I recommend it
Time when I was down
Time to be never around

Next man who's in line
Better knows what lies behind
That vivid talk you got
It costs a man an awful lot
Well baby, just an afterthought

Whatchu doin'
Girl, you're overstepping it quite a lot
If that's what you reap, then
Then I must have been mistaken a lot

Your grip was firm
But you did find a way to lose what you got
It is not up to me to
Let you know what is right, what is not

Honey, be careful
It's time that you bought
Karma won't treat you
Like someone you're not

Honey, be careful
It's time that you bought
Karma won't treat you
Like someone you're not

Honey, be careful
It's time that you bought
Karma won't treat you
Like someone you're not
Honey, be careful
It's time that you bought
Karma won't treat you
Like someone you're not
Honey, be careful
It's time that you bought
Karma won't treat you
Like someone you're not
Honey, be careful
It's time that you bought
Karma won't treat you
Like someone you're not
