Ole man trouble leave me alone
Go find you someone else to pick on
I live my life in doubt, you see now
Ole man trouble

Please stay away from me, oh now
Ooh yeah
Yeah

Oh, I look like I'm down with my luck
Please send faith to just help pick me up
I've lived this way for so many years, now now now
Ole man trouble

Please wash away all my fears, ole man
Good Lord of mine
Help me when I fall

Sometimes, sometime I get a little worried
Ole man trouble, please, please
Stay away from me

Ole man trouble
Ole man trouble, Lord I
Ole man may return
Stay away, stay away
You are nothin' but trouble
Just stay away, stay away
Just stay away
You're nothin' but, nothin'
Nothin', but trouble
Please I said, trouble
Ole man trouble, leave me alone
