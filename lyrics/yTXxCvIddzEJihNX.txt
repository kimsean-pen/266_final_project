When we first moved in together
Couldn't keep hands off each other
No we're lying back to back
And silence in the black
We used to laugh until we cried
You used to look at me and smile
Now we hardly say hello
And feelings never show

All the signs seem to say love is lost
I don't wanna give up what we've got

Maybe you could stay a bit longer
I could try a bit harder
We could make this work
But maybe we should stop pretending
We both know we're hurting
Maybe it's time to go

We broke up last Sunday night
Keep on thinking 'bout the fight
Rest my head against the wall
Your bags are by the door
Then your key turns in the lock
you see me on the stairs and stop

Have you had a change of heart?
Can we go back to the start?

But all the signs seem to say love is lost
But I don't wanna give up yet because...

Maybe you could stay a bit longer
I could try a bit harder
We could make this work
But maybe we should stop pretending
We both know we're hurting
Maybe it's time to go

Maybe it's time to go
Maybe it's time to go
Maybe it's time to go
We could make it work
We could make it work

Maybe you could stay a bit longer
I could try a bit harder
We could make this work
But maybe we should stop pretending
both of us are hurting
Maybe it's time to go
Maybe it's time to go go
Maybe We could make this work
Maybe it's time to go go
Maybe We could make this work
Maybe it's time to go
