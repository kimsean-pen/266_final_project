Got to disappear in some great void of water
Want to be arrested by the sound
Under sheets of metal
Underneath it all
I am nothing,
I am but a shape

Galleries of water
Underneath the length of her
Doesn't matter what I say, she will always be here

Put the pieces in there, watch them disappear
Worthless to be able, it is lost in the sound
Extricate the battle by just saying nothing
Got to be more careful of this Hell

Galleries of water
Underneath the length of her
Doesn't matter what I say, she will always be here
She won't go away
