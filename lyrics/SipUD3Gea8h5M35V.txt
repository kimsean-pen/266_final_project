Yeah!

This wall of stone
That they built to cage our minds
Grip the gun of changing times
Like no one's home
They will burn down every bridge
Spread the word of ignorance
All blind to your eyes
Forget the innocent

Say a prayer, every night
All we hear must be right
I am the outsider
Living life for the end
Nothing left to defend
I am the outsider

I'm not the hope
That's just wishing for the past
Like bringing Christ back from the ash
Could save the world
They have risen for the sins
Of missing why we can't begin
A night in this time

Say a prayer, every night
All we hear must be right
I am the outsider
Living life for the end
Nothing left to defend
I am the outsider

Say a prayer, every night
All we hear must be right
Evert word, we believe!

Whoa!

Say a prayer, every night
All we hear must be right (Must be right!)
I am the outsider
Living life for the end
Nothing left to defend (Yeah!)

I am the outsider
I am the outsider
I am the outsider
