One life to live to pay your daily fee
The labour for your love
Weighted with hours that never cease
They will tell you that you'll never make it
Corruption lies within
Never bow to forty thousand feet

We will survive
This is the only way
We will make it out alive
We will survive
Unless you persevere
You'll be left to rot behind

Two deaths to die everything is closing in
Still pushing forward
Now you're standing on the edge
They still tell you that you'll never make it
The avaricious won't amend
You will be carried safely in the end

We will survive
This is the only way
We will make it out alive
We will survive
Unless you persevere
You'll be left to rot behind

The slaving wager leads men to more than war
*Killing Frenzy*

Motherfucker bounce

This is my survival

We will survive
We will survive

We will survive
We will survive
