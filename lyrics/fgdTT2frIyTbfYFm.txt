The girl that I love
Doesn't love me too
I'm singing oh I'm hurt
Drown my sorrows in a bar
A man came from the dark and hit me
Oh, I'm hurt
Everything's wrong, everything's bad
Everything happens to me
Everything's down
since I came to this town
I used to be so happy
Home wasn't far
but someone stole my car
I'm singing oh I'm hurt
By now I was getting bugged
And soon I was getting mugged
Singing oh I'm hurt
