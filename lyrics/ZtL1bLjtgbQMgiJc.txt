Behold the apocalypse
The end is closing in
Did you ever really doubt
That we would pay for our sins...

(Chorus:)
The heavens will burn
No one can save us now
Everything we once loved
Shall perish in flames...

Armageddon coming on
A black dawn slowly rising
The heat will slowly consume you
Like a moth around a flame

(1st lead - Michael)
(Acoustic Lead - Christopher)
(2nd Lead - Christopher)

Out of this silent planet
A single sign of life appears
A man made machine
Carrying an embryo of human life...
