I'd go to the dark side for you
You shoot the apple off of my head
'Cause the love, sweet love, is all that you put me through
And honey, without it you know i'm gonna be dead

I'm tied up
Tangled up
I got my heart wrapped up
In you

I'm tied up
Tangled up
I got my heart wrapped up
In you

And now that I'm in deep in this fire
And that's not the least of what I would do
'Cause the love, sweet love, is all about a burning desire
And sugar, you know that I'll burn for you

I'm tied up
Tangled up
And I'm all wrapped up
In you

I'm tied up
Tangled up
I'm all wrapped up
In you

Tied up
I'm tangled up
And I'm all wrapped up
In you

I'm tied up
I'm tangled up
Wrapped up
In you, you, you
