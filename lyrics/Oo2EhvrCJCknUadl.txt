By silverfish imperatrix, whose incorrupted eye
Sees through the charms of doctors and their wives
By salamander, drake, and the power that was undine
Rise to claim Saturn, ring and sky
By those who see with their eyes closed
They know me by my black telescope

Your green tree mantle from which these things derive
A lens of quartz and refract spoke
That crystal lens whose crystal rope
Once bound me to those Doctors and wives

When my vision was oh, so cloudy
And I saw things through two eyes

I am a sailor on the raging depths
And I know a thing or two
Back to the corner mates and over the side
Yes I know a thing or two

By silverfish imperatrix, whose incorrupted eye
Sees through the charms of doctors and their wives
By salamander, drake, and the power that was undine
Rise to claim Saturn, ring and sky
By those who see with their eyes closed
you'll know me by my black telescope

Before my great conversion when the ridge was closed
Before my visit to the workshop of telescopes

By silverfish imperatrix, whose incorrupted eye
sees through the charms of doctors and their wives
By salamander, drake, and the power that was undine
Rise to claim Saturn, ring and sky
By those who see with their eyes closed
you'll know me by my...
