You fool no one,
Waiting to see if I'm gone.
So hard to see
You are taking your chances with me.
If I find you with some other man

You know what I'm gonna do.
Better run if you see me comin', ah.

Soon you will fall,
Making mistakes like before.

When you tell me lies
I can see by the look in your eyes.
If you think you're gonna take me for granted,
Chasin' round with all you see,
Gonna make you live to regret it, ah.

You fool no one,
Waiting to see if I'm gone.
So clear I can see
You've had all your chances with me.
You thought that you could take me for granted
But I couldn't take it no more.
Better run when you see me comin', ah
