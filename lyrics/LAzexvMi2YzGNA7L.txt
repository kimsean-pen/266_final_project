In the dirty old city
There is my home
There is my home
There is my home
There is my home

Nothing really looks pretty
And I've been alone
I've been alone
I've been alone
I've been alone

And in my heart
Many wishes are crying
Living and dying
And in my heart
Many wishes are crying
Living and dying

In the house of darkness
Here's a magic stone
Magic stone
Magic stone
The magic stone

But I couldn't find it
'Cause the shine is gone
Shine is gone
Shine is gone
The shine is gone

And in my heart
Many wishes are crying
Living and dying
And in my heart
Many wishes are crying
Living and dying
Living and dying
Living and dying
