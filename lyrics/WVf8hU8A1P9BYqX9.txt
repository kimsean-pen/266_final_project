The modern with the warrior
The mean with the stride
The Tom with the Sawyer
And the mean, mean, mean, mean pride

And though his mind is not for rent
Don't put him down as arrogant
His reserve, a quiet defense
Riding out the day's events

The river

What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the mist, mist, catch the myth, myth
Cast the mystery, catch the drift, drift

The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his skies - are - wide

The Tom with the Sawyer
With the eye on the you
The space he invades
He gets by, by, by, by...

[Break]

No, his mind is not for rent
To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent
He knows changes aren't permanent

But change is

What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the witness, catch the wit, wit
Cast the spirit, catch the spit, spit

The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his skies - are - wide

Exit the warrior
The Tom with the Sawyer
The eye on the you, energy trade
Right on to the friction of the day, day, day, day...
