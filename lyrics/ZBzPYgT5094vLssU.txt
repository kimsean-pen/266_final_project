Stay young forever

You've done this to yourself or so, so it seems
You left behind everything
All your friends and all your family
Does it not feel slightly daunting
How you still sleep at night
When you must be able to hear them fight
It's all about you
All about you
All about the way you choose to live

You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough
You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough

How did it come to this

Is there any point to this, are you even listening to us

You still left everyone you loved
Crushed, broken, snapped straight in half
You still left everyone you loved
Crushed, broken, snapped straight in half

You made your choice now turn and get out
You made your choice now turn and get out

How do you sleep at night
It's all about you, it's all about you
How do you sleep at night
It's all about you, it's all about you

You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough
You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough

You left everyone you loved
Crushed
Broken
Snapped straight in half
