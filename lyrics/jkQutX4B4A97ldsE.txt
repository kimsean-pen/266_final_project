Eyes that shall never see
A life chosen not to be fulfilled
Fate does not choose a life
Before the hand of Man

As the ants march you to your grave

Welcome to this violent station
The termination proclamation
All who enter here are killed
Prepare for death, forget will

The lines of right and wrong
Are blurred in the name of freedom
As those who cannot speak
Assume their positions and die

Feel the hook pulled by the system slave

Welcome to this violent station
The termination proclamation
All who enter here are killed
Prepare for death, forget will

Forget will

[Solo]

Dead eyes can never see
The beauty of disorder

As the army ants march you to your grave

Welcome to this violent station
The termination proclamation
All who enter here are killed
Prepare for death, forget will
