The silent moment right before the
Dusk fades away
I open my eyes but the darkness
stays
Nightfrost covers the brittle flowers
Around you
I realize that what I dreamt is true

Beauty beyond words
My dearest one
Her light burns my eyes
She is all mine

By these frosty waters I rest by
Your side
I hold you in my arms for the last
Time
If only I could tell you how I need
Your love
If only you had seen what I kept in
My heart

Now it's the time of grieving
Reign of sorrow in my heart
All i have ever wanted
Is today forever gone
Bitter is the nightly silence
Bitter till the end of time
The sky grown ever darker
Through now she"ll always be mine

I hold you on my arms so tight
I kiss your frozen lips for this last
Time
For the first time
