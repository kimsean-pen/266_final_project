Kisses like marshmallow melts on my neck
A whimsical warning too sweet to forget
Let's get lost, somewhere in the night
Tell your stories and I'll tell you mine

I'm bound
Bound
Bound
I'm so in love now
I'm down
Down
Down
When you're not around
Oh stay here
Stay here
I need you around
Stay here
Stay here

A nuclear nectar planted on my lips
Consoling serenity is all that you give
And you showed up when I felt so dead
I'm so torn up when you're not in my bed

I'm bound
Bound
Bound
I'm so in love now
I'm down
Down
Down
When you're not around
Oh stay here
Stay here
I need you around
Stay here
Stay here

Maybe silly dreams can come true
Daily doubting then I found you
Ahh
Sometimes I wonder if it's even real
But I could never fake what I feel
Ahh

Maybe silly dreams can come true
