Right foot
Followed by a left foot
We'll guide you home before your curfew
and into your bed

Standing on our tip-toes
Peering through open windows
I swear I heard my name

Sit tight with the lights off
Waiting for my brain to start
Trying to work things out
It's thunder and it's lighting
And it's all things too frightening
I could barely see outside

Your body was black and blue
It struck twice there's nothing new

Your body was black and blue
It struck twice there's nothing new

Your body was black and blue
Your body was black

And it's thunder
And it's lightning
Coming home

And it's thunder
And it's lightning
Coming back

Your body was black and blue
Your body was black and blue
And your body...

I have to say goodnight
I'm leaving before you're punching out my lights

I have to say goodnight
I'm leaving before you're punching out my lights

I have to say goodnight
I'm leaving before you're punching out my lights

I have to say goodnight
I'm leaving before you're punching out my lights

I'm leaving.
