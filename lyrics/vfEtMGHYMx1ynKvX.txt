Veins die and I fantasize to find hurt another way
My baseline, I take time in the middle

The bile fills the leech
I hear them talking in their sleep
A vessel to the ether sea
The varicose encasing me

Why can't they see the lights are
synchronizing into the shadows underneath?
Why can't they see the lights are synchronizing?
I feel them change velocities

Draw slow when you take from me
I need time
It's just I can't suffer honestly
The taste of chemicals keep me alive
I feel the pain through a surrogate
The brittle bones of a middle child
They call a state of emergency to get me back to my baseline

And it hurts a little
And I lie a little in my refuge

Veins die and I fantasize to find hurt another way
My baseline, I take time in the middle

There must be something more out there
There must be something more out there
So powerless in the cross hairs
There must be something more out there

Veins die and I fantasize to find hurt another way
My baseline, I take time in the middle
You said the pain was perennial, I need hurt another way
My baseline, I take time in the middle

Oh, you make it hurt a little
And l lie a little
Oh, you make it hurt a little in my refuge
You make it hurt a little
And l lie a little
Oh, you make it hurt a little in my refuge

There must be something more out there
There must be something more out there
