As the symbols of the metaphysics
Of the hangman are taken off
The walls of our living rooms

Humanity emancipates
Christ statues fall and die of age
Just like us in organic decay

The myths of the martyrs have waned
No longer do we mourn their loss
Their children dance and play their games
In the shadow of the great old white cross

Wealth heals all wounds
And alleviates any kind of pain
The shroud of collective oblivion coats
Any individual scars

The widows of the skeptical
Have passed away before they ever could retaliate
And those who baptized the world with the sword
Have long been buried and have not arisen from their graves

The guardians of righteousness
Have lost their immaculity
The rise of the enlightenment
Has defeated Christianity

But its legacy of fear and submissiveness prevails
In many brave man's heart and soul
The saddening conception
That humanity cannot choose its own destiny

With our lives based on the hope for salvation
The humanist paradigm is nothing but a charade
Condemned to inertia, a passive race
We wait and contemplate

And even in these days and age some people still believe
That earth is at the center of God's own universe
And that man was made the 7th day, evolution is a myth
And that even bones of ancient creatures are no evidence
Of the fact that we are not the end of the chain

And they won't leave their ship that is sinking
They refuse to leave their ship that is sinking

And while they spoke of grace and love
Forgiveness from above
They nailed thousands of non-believers
To their crude symbol of love

And they won't leave their ship that is sinking
They refuse to leave their ship that is sinking

The myth that man is the crown of God's creation
Breeds the excuse to deplete the earth today
The myth that man is the crown of God's creation
Supports our present anthropocentric misconception

And even in these days and age some people still believe
That earth is at the center of God's own universe

And they won't leave their ship that is sinking
They refuse to leave their ship that is sinking

The myth that man is the crown of God's creation
Breeds the excuse to deplete the earth today
The myth that man is the crown of God's creation
