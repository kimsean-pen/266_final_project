I just want to hold your hand
I just wanted you to dance
Like those times we used to know
On those television shows

I just want to make you cry
For all those times I made you cry
For all those times we used to know
On those television shows

I'm having televisions
I'm having Televisions
I'm having TELEVISIONS
I'm having TELE/VISIONS
