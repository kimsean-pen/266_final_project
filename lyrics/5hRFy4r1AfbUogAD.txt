You're Grace makes all Saints out if Sinners...
Guide my heart, hold my hand, as I try to walk the path.
So much potential, so many thoughts, lead me so, I don't get lost.
If I get lost, along the way, I need your grace, I need your grace.
Something I'm feeling just takes over me, just want to give up.
Know how it is when you lose everything, something about your love
let's me know that the story's not over
it's just the start, and in my darkest hour, you know my heart
We all need you preachers, deacons, thugs, and drug dealers.
Your Grace makes ALL Saints out of Sinners!
Now I've tried my ways
but the way that I need is yours
I look to you when it's all right
I'll look to you when it's all wrong
Please, remind me, when I get low
What you see when you look at me
What I know I can be

Something I'm feelimg just takes over me
I just want to give up
Know how it feels when you lose everything
Something about your love
Makes me know the story's not over
It's just the start
And in my darkest hours
You know my heart
We all need you preachers, deacons, thugs, and drug dealers.
You're grace makes ALL Saints out of Sinners
You said you would never go
So I need you to walk, I need you to talk
I nees you to hold me colse
Please be my fence Lord,
In those darkest times I see
One set of foot steps
Walking in the sand
I know that yoy carry me
One thing I know, that I'm sure
The story's not over, it's just the start
In my darkest hours, you know my heart
We ALL need you; preachers, deacons, thugs, and drug dealers.
Your Grace makes ALL Saints out of Sinners
Your Grace,
Your Grace, Your Grace and Mercy
We need your
Joy, Love, Peace, Happiness is in you
Only your Grace and Mercy can see me through
Your Grace
Your Love
Saints & Sinners...
