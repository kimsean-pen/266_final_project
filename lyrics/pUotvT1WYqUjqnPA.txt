Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious they get to know that
Life ain't always what it seems to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone we're still a team
Through your family I'll fulfill your dream
In the future can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce sometimes, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you're still livin' your life after death

(Every step I take) Every step I take
(Every move I make) Every move I make
(Every single day) Every single day
(Every time I pray) Every time I pray
(I'll be missing you) BIG I miss you so much c'mon ya

(Thinking of the day) When I think of that day
(When you went away) The day you went away
(What a life to take)
(What a bond to break)
(I'll be missing you) Check this out

It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven smilin' down
Watching us while we pray for you
Everyday we pray for you
Till the day we meet again
In my heart is where I keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts, BIG, I just can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you're still livin' your life after death

(Every step I take) Every step I take
(Every move I make) Every move I make
(Every single day)
(Every time I pray)
(I'll be missing you) I'll be missing you
(Thinking of the day) When I think of that day c'mon
(When you went away) When do you went away
(What a life to take) What a life to take
(What a bond to break) What a bond to break
(I'll be missing you) I'll be missing you

Somebody tell me why
(On that morning) When this life
(When this life is over) We're gonna see
(I know, I'll see your face)

(Every move I make)
(Every step I take)
(Every move I make)
(Every step I take)
(Every move I make)
(Every step I take)
(Every move I make)
(Every step I take)
(Every move I make) Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you
