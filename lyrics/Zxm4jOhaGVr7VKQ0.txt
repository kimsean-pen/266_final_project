Turn around, open up that smile, I know it's buried down there deep
Look around places, change along with names I never heard before

Trust in yourself, only from within
You trust in yourself to see it from the inside out inside out

But maybe you can try and go, handle things all on your own
Holding on to something that is real
You need it like a common drug, pass it down along with us
Trade in all your worries for something real

Safe and sound hide inside your inner secrets
All around twenty one the age you're seekin
Keep it down, you see it, you see it?
Inside out inside out

Safe and sound hide inside your inner secrets
All around twenty one the age you're seekin
Keep it down, you see it, you see it?
Inside out inside out

Safe and sound hide inside your inner secrets
All around twenty one the age you're seekin
Keep it down, you see it, you see it?
Inside out inside out

You need it like a common drug pass it down along with us
Trade in all your worries for something real
