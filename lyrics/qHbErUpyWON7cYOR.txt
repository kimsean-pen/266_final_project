We can be strong
We can be strong
Out on this lonely road
It's on the road to love

We can be strong
We can be strong
Follow that unicorn
On the road to love

Run, run with her t-
Run, run with her t-
Run, run with her t-
Run, run with her t-
Run, run with her t-
Run, run with her t-
Run, run with her t-

Run, run with her top down, baby, she flies
Run, run with the fury of a saint in her eyes

Run, run, cha, cha, cha, baby, she goes
With blond hair and a gun smoking under her toes

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ride, ride, pony, ride, ride
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ride, ride, pony, tonight

We can be strong
We can be strong
Out on this lonely road,
On the road to love

We can be strong
We can be strong
Follow that unicorn
On the road to love

I'm on whoa, oh oh whoa
I'm on the road to love

I'm on whoa, oh oh whoa
I'm on the road to love

She's just an American, riding a dream
When she's got a rainbow syrup and her heart that she bleeds

They don't care if your papers or your love is the law
She's a, free soul, burning roads with a flag in her bra

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ride, ride, pony, ride, ride
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ride, ride, pony, tonight

We can be strong
We can be strong
Out on this lonely road
On the road to love

We can be strong
We can be strong
Follow that unicorn
On the road to love

I'm on whoa, oh oh whoa
I'm on the road to love

I'm on whoa, oh oh whoa
I'm on the road to love

Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
Cause we're gonna drink until we die

Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
Cause we're gonna drink until we die

Die
