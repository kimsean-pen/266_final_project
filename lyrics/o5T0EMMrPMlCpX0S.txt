instrumentals
racey days
help me through the hopeless haze
but my,
oh my.
Tragic eyes
that I can't even recognize myself
behind.
...
So if the answer is no,
can I change your mind?
...
Out again
A siren screams at half past ten and you won't
let go.
While I ignore
that we both felt like this before
it starts to show.
So if I have a chance, would you let me know.
...
Why aren't you shaking?
Step back in time.
Graciously taken.
Oh you're too kind.
And if the answer is no, can I change your mind?
We're all the same,
and love is blind.
The sun is gone,
before it shines.
And I said: if the answer is no, can I change your mind?
If the answer is no, can I change your mind?
