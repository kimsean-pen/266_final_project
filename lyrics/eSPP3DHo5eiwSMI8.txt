O darkness, if in thy arms I could rest
For a while and with these earthly eyes
See thy dim smile

Maid of twilight, lass of duskfall
Hang the moon on the sky's arch
Soothe the weight of a darkling day

Croon me into the slumber
Rock here in the birch's lap
Swing in the manor of wind
Lay down your weary head

Let the blue stars darken
Rock here in the birch's lap
Swing in the manor of wind

Lay down your weary head
Let the blue stars darken
O silence, if in thy cradle I could sway
Like a child, heart the amending song

The sighing of the shades
Maid of twilight, lass of duskfall
Serve thy goblet to me
Let me drink to the last drop

The sweet opiate of the dreams
Rock here in the birch's lap
Swing in the manor of wind
Lay down your weary head

Let the blue stars darken
Rock here in the birch's lap
Swing in the manor of wind
Lay down your weary head
Let the blue stars darken
Ours is the silence
The echo old ageless night
A gleam in the blackest of streams
One fleeing moment
For vain is all the toil and trouble
Vain is all the heartbreak
In the end I'll find my solace
In an earthen cradle
So good night.
