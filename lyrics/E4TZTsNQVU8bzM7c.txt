I liberate
I liberate the cold inside
Camouflaged
But is it all same guy, same guy?

There's a bad scene
Worked up and sterilized
There's a black seed
Chocked up and burning

Unfamiliar, unremorseful
That's the way you were
Don't want to bring it up again
That's the way you were
Oh, well

You raise questions of me
You haunt sections of town

Unfamiliar, unremorseful
That's the way you were
Don't want to bring it up again
That's the way you were
Unfamiliar, unremorseful
That's the way you were
Don't want to bring it up again
That's the way you were

Be this or not I know I don't understand
How this is appropriate
Be this or not and no we don't understand
How bad at debate we are
And so we freeze
And so we freeze
And so we freeze
