Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana
I got molly, I got white
I got molly, I got white
I been trapping, trapping, trapping, trapping all damn night

Hannah Montana I'm selling them bricks out the phantom
Got Hannah Montana I'm drinking the lean out the phantom
Glaw, Glaw, Glaw, fuck nigga got anna
Got your bitch, she white, Hannah Montana in a Panamara
She a college girl, but her wrist Katrina
In the kitchen, and she baking like Anita
Hit the club, diamonds shining like I'm drinking Magarita
I'm in London with the plug, getting the same car as the Beatles
Got bricks in the Audi, the Hannah Montana, the molly go crazy
Got Lizzy Mcguire, Got Linsey Lohan and I can't forget about Katy
I keep the white like the 80s, I keep the white like I'm Shady
Put the white rims on the Mercedes, young nigga feel like Pat Swayze

I got molly, I got white
I got molly, I got white
I been trapping, trapping, trapping, trapping all damn night

Got your main bitch on the handle, she dropping and popping no castles
I'm smoking on gas like tobacco, I'm drinking on lean taste like Snapple
In the vip rolling a cord, passing out mollies to foreigns
They popping them like they some skittles, 2 bitches one me, Malcolm in the middle
Hop off up in the new Bugatti, cameras flashing paparazzi
She popping that capsule, no Nazi
I'm twisting the rock like I'm Rocsi
She sweating like she ran a mile, she soaking wet she need a towel
She sucking her lip, biting down
She moaning and making them sounds
She came while she sucking me now
I'm looking at her like damn
Hannah making them go bananas
She fucking and sucking on camera
Pop a handle, she got stamina
My jag, still a Panorama
I'm beating the pussy like Michael, I call her Dirty Diana

I got molly, I got white

I been trapping, trapping, trapping, trapping all damn night
