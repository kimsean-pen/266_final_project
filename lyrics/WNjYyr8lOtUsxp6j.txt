i wanted to tell her but i stuck to my lies
i wanted to tell her till i looked in her eyes
i wanted to tell her but i stuck to my lies
i wanted to tell her till i looked in her eyes
i wanted to tell her
i needed to tell her

just like the wind you blew away your happy lover's touch
you bring the blues into my heart just like a rush
i cannot bear the way my heart has helped to keep you close
of you my babe i cannot get enough
you touch me baby

i loved you to the lines of lies you told when i asked her name
i knew the perfume in your hair just wasn't mine
did you ever think to notice me when you wasn't home?
i noticed every time

i wanted to tell her but i stuck to my lies
i wanted to tell her till i looked in her eyes
i wanted to tell her but i stuck to my lies
i wanted to tell her till i looked in her eyes

thought you noticed every time but you didn't notice a thing
i'd have to cover up my calls when the telephone would ring
i'm tired of you and the things you do and all the things you say
no more babysitting for neurotic girls today

i'm thinking that the pain i'm going through just to keep you babe
is something that i should bear
did you ever stop to notice me when you had nothing?
and i never cared?

just like the wind you blew away your happy lover's touch
you bring the blues into my life just like a rush
i cannot bear the way my heart has helped to keep you close
of you my babe i cannot get enough
you touch me baby, don't be mean to me!

i wanted to tell her but i stuck to my lies
i wanted to tell her till i looked in her eyes
i wanted to tell her but i stuck to my lies
i wanted to tell her till i looked in her eyes
i wanted to tell her but i stuck to my lies
i wanted to tell her till i looked in her eyes
i wanted to tell her
i needed to tell her
