I have a picture
Pinned in my wall
An image of you and of me and we're Laughing and loving it all
Look at our life now
We tattered and torn
We fuss and we fight and delight in the tears That we cry until dawn
Hold me now
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let loving start
Let loving start
You say I'm a dreamer
We're two of a kind
Both of us searching for some perfect world We know we'll never find
So perhaps I should leave here
Yeah, go far away
But you know that there's nowhere that I Rather be than with you here today
Hold me now
Warm my heart
Stay with me
I want you stay with me
Let loving start
Let loving start
Hold me now
Warm my heart
Stay with me
I want you stay with me
Let loving start
Let loving start
If you ask me to
I will run with you
When you hold me
Baby baby
You ask if I love you
(You know I love you)
But what can I say
(There's nothing that I can say)
You know that I do and if this is just one of Tose games that we play
So I'll sing you a new song
(Baby ooh)
Please dont cry anymore
And I'll ask your forgiveness
Tho I dont know just why I'm asking it for
Hold me now
Hold me in your loving arms
Warm my heart
Oh! my cold and tired heart
Stay with me
I want you stay with me
Let loving start
Let loving start
Hold me now
Hold me in your loving arms
Warm my heart
Oh! my cold and tired heart
Stay with me
I want you stay with me
Let loving start
Let loving start
