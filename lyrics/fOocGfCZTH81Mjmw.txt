I got you arrested because
The party'd come and gone, gone
I am about to, to set this off
Until weed party's dull, it's dull
The wine is there to keep yourself
You got it wrong

So I brought you purplexing thoughts
And words were at a loss, a loss
It's a good day to skip because
Your party's gonna come, it's come
The wine is there to keep yourself
But don't you ever listen at all
The parents aren't enforcing the laws, oh

The wine is there to keep yourself
But don't you ever listen at all
The parents aren't enforcing the laws, oh
