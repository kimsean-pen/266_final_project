Would you go to war for me, baby
Would you cry for the weak
And die for the peace of men
Oh how can we know
You and I both know
So let's make this boatload of excuses burn and sink

One day it all comes down to this
You can sink or swim
You can hit or miss
One day it all comes down
One day we all go down

I'll take my heart back
And set the people free
I'll leave the dead to die
And take who's coming with me (x2)

Step back for all the world to see
Your life means all the world to me
I'll take your pain and suffering
I'm such a sucker sometimes
Sometimes we don't know
To plug up those bullet holes
Oh you feel so close, don't let go until I say

One day we'll drink to this and say
Remember when we died
We went out in flames
One day we'll drink to this and say
Remember when we died
We went out...

I'll take my heart back
And set the people free
I'll leave the dead to die
And take who's coming with me

I'll take my heart back
And set the people free
I'll leave the dead to die
There will be blood in the streets

I'll take my heart back
And set the people free
I'll leave the dead to die
And take who's coming with me (x2)
