I'm just a victim of your wildest lies
Send in my photo with another name
I'm society's victim
Nobody has to get you to buy it now
That's your concern and I don't vote
I'm society's victim
I'm just the subject of discussion now
The one no-one admires
I'm society's victim
I'm not just sufferin' from paranoia
It's invented by you and them
I'm society's victim
