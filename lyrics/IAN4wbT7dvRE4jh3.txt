Awakened I have become, light now slips away
Manipulate your mind, darkness is my slave
Taste the sins of Hell, the blood that I so crave
The last thing that you see is the hunger in my eyes

Blood sucking creatures of the night
Nocturnal spectre hiding from the light
Cries screaming out every fright
Eagerly awaiting plight
Apparitions from the pits of Hell
Death plagues the streets in which they dwell
Demented lust, the secrets they must keep
Addicted to your blood, at dawn they sleep

Unveil the hidden coffin, lift the lid of terror
Feel the deadly cold freeze you from inside
Perceiving your intentions to slay the phantom form
Raise the stake in malice, you cannot plunge it down

Blood sucking creatures of the night
Nocturnal spectre hiding from the light
Cries screaming out every fright
Eagerly awaiting plight
Apparitions from the pits of Hell
Death plagues the streets in which they dwell
Demented lust, the secrets they must keep
Addicted to your blood, at dawn they sleep

Beware the image unseen
Stalks your soul, your corpse's redeem
Eternal damnation you just reward
A servant of our Lord by your accord
Admonish of the cruciform
Impalement, immortality's scorned
Rise hold fast your faith
To lie dormant is certain death

Driven by the instinct of centuries of horror
Implanted along the brain of the sickening parasite
Linked together by one trait, the Hell-filled need to kill
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

Emerging from their Hellish tomb
Taking flight amidst the night, evening skies are raining death
Swooping down from shadowed skies
Taking simple human form, shed their wings to stalk the mortal man
Lock their jaws into your veins
Satanic soldiers strike their prey, leaving corpses waiting for the change
Blood dripping from the jaws of death
Not enough to satisfy, they must drain your soul of life
