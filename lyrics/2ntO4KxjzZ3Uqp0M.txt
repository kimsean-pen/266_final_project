They say your middle name is trouble
But I know it's Caroline
They say you remind them problems
But I think you look like Audrey

Caroline, I know
That you put on a show
Everytime you two disagree

This heart is a stone
No one will ever break it
This heart is a stone
Close to you it breaks easily
'Cause everything that they say
Tells me to go away
But everything that I feel
Tells me to stay

They say they can smell the drama
But I know it's "No. 5"
They say you only bring heartache
But I know you brought a bottle of wine

Caroline, I know
That you put on a show
Everytime you two disagree

This heart is a stone
No one will ever break it
This heart is a stone
Close to you it breaks easily
'Cause everything that they say
Tells me to go away
But everything that I feel
Tells me to stay

They say all like a Monday morning
I say all like a Friday night
I don't get their point
Anytime is a good time for being with you

This heart is a stone
No one will ever break it
This heart is a stone
Close to you it breaks easily
'Cause everything that they say
Tells me to go away
But everything that I feel
Tells me to stay
