Last night I said I was fine
But I lied my heart in thousand pieces
Million pieces tonight

I said I was fine
But I lied my heart in thousand pieces so
Say everything is alright, hoh

Just say everything is alright, hoh
Just say everything is alright

My friends tell me to stop
Not to worry they tell me to wait
And see what happens
See what happens with you

My friends tell me to stop
Not to worry they tell me to wait so
Say everything is alright, hoh

Just say everything is alright, hoh
Just say everything is alright

So let's straighten this baby
Don't break me my baby
You know you owe me better
How come you don't remember
I'm living by the hour
I'm living by the minute
So stay with me baby
Don't break me my baby say

Oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
