Waking, sitting up right
Can't explain the sunlight
Wondering why you're not home
The lighter beside you, left
Before you tried to work out all the unknowns

Blame it all on me when I forget to defend
Everything that we worked out
Something in her wording
I cannot help searching for what memory found

Thought it stopped just as its start
But that is not what you are
You're a layer on my clothes made of ivy and gold

Meet me in the hallway
Bite your lip when I say: "Never have you left my mind"
Stop and think it over, smiling, moving closer
Oh, what a delicate time

Blame it all on me when I forget to defend
Everything that we put down
Something in her wording
I guess she was just searching for some knowledge or sound

Thought it stopped just as its start
But that is not what you are
You're a layer on my clothes made of ivy and gold
