Love like a needle full of methadone,
Potent but not real, left you wanting more.
Lipstick track marks bleeding wet,
like Montagues and Capulets,
For us child, the stars refuse to shine.
Oh well, for us child the stars refuse to shine.

Somewhere strung-out on the lamb, we wound up back here again,
Like unstable chemicals combining only to explode,

What would it take for you to notice?
That I am a heart on fire and all the world's the fuse, so don't get close.
Trouble and the worth, am I better off on my own?

Contaminated quarantine, then left alone.
A shipment refused, a trust unkown.
Damaged goods they soon forget,
A choking dust where we got left,
For us all the stars refuse to shine.
So tap the vein and light the match, we burn like stars before the crash,
But for you there's still a chance, just let go.

What would it take for you to notice?
That I am a heart on fire and all the world's the fuse, so don't get close.
Trouble and the worth, I'm better off on my own,
On my own.

Now there's no way to run,
and yeah there's nowhere to hide.
There's nothing under the sun,
we haven't already tried.

What would it take for you to notice?
That I am a hand grenade, pin already pulled so don't let go.
As we chase the sun, my shadow slows us down.
Without me you know, you're better off.
And I know, you're better off.
And I know, and I know.
