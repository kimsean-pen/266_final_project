Walk out on the deck, Manolos and cigarettes
Lookin' out from here wondering how far I could get
Running in the circles where the chips are legit
Workin' it, I know it ain't an easy ticket
And so I take it to the Avenues looking all confident
Tell ya that I used to question what it was, make 'em incontinent
I once thought they'd all talk about the dress I wore tonight
I mistook all those looks, not for the girl just for the hype
But the one good thing, nipped or tucked
You cannot change your luck
Shake it up, just so the thrill don't stop
Cause when we get stuck
We say that's all it was, all it was
I say come on down, we'll sashay through town
They call me the Rendezvous Girl
Got more power in my calender
Than the queen herself
Come on down, we'll sashay through town
They call me the Rendezvous Girl
Got more power in my calender
Than the queen herself
I got a problem can't get past it
I'll put a man in a casket
I got another thinkin' he's in love
I break it to 'em with a velvet glove
Warning I'm hot to trot, you gonna hurt yourself
I know the hunt, it can be beautiful
But the one good thing, nipped or tucked
You cannot change your luck
Shake it up, just so the thrill don't stop
Cause when we get stuck
We say that's all it was, all it was
I say come on down, we'll sashay through town
They call me the Rendezvous Girl
Got more power in my calender
Than the queen herself
Come on down, we'll sashay through town
They call me the Rendezvous Girl
Got more power in my calender
Than the queen herself
Hear what I told ya
Want to make them adore ya Hear what I told ya
Want to make them adore ya
Come on down, we'll sashay through town
They call me the Rendezvous Girl
Got more power in my calender
Than the queen herself
Come on down, we'll sashay through town
They call me the Rendezvous Girl
Got more power in my calender
Than the queen herself
Hear what I told ya (Come on down, we'll sashay through town)
Want to make them adore ya (They call me the Rendezvous Girl)
Hear what I told ya (Got more power in my calender)
Want to make them adore ya (Than the queen herself)
Hear what I told ya (Come on down, we'll sashay through town)
Want to make them adore ya (They call me the Rendezvous Girl)
Hear what I told ya (Got more power in my calender)
Want to make them adore ya (Than the queen herself)
