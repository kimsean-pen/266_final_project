I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and this arrow here
I'm gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other boys out there to play
I've been tempted too long

Go on, give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to wanna be your man
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason if you can

From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Through a different frame of mind
A thousand flowers may bloom
Wouldn't it be time to move over, move over, and give me some room

Go on, give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to wanna be your man
Give me a reason to love you
Please, one reason if you can

Don't you start looking like some woman
Take a little look from the outside if you can
Move over me now, try a little tenderness

A little shabby dress, I wouldn't care Only cry for you, cry for you
Might die for you too.
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to want to be your man

Give me a reason to love you
Oh please, give me a reason if you can
Since the beginning of forever
Forever and ever, and ever, and ever
It's time to move over now
I'm so tired of playing
Of playing with this bow and this arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Gonna leave it to the other boys to play
I've been tempted too long

Too long
I've been tempted every day
Tempted too long
Oh please
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to want to be your man
Give me a reason to love you, to love you
Give me a reason if you can
A reason if you can
