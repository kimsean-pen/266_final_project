Yeah, look...

If I was your girlfriend you
Would have to be hotter,
Yeah I don't like it when
They after me

Let me see
If I put you in my
Schedule after 3
I'm 100,
You never get half of me
I like pretty boys...
And there's something
I should mention
You can be the one,
Be the one,
One Direction.

I like if you can dance and
I also like nerds
So, want a smooth talker
I'm already good with words

You tryin' to see
If you the one for me...
So boy guess,
I would have to be.

If i was your girlfriend
I'd have to let you know
I only want the "real" thing
Never puttin' on a show

'Cause I don't call attention
I like keeping it on the low
So, if i was your girlfriend...
I'd have to let you know
This is how it's gonna go.

I like it if you got a job but
I got my own cash.
And I ain't with it if you
Trying to move so fast,
I want a best friend,
Someone I can laugh with
Someone I can share
My Disney Land pass with

No drama
I already got enough.
Can't buy my love
I already got a lot of stuff.

I'm so classic...
So smash hit, so fast pitch
So that's it.

You trying to see...
If you're the one for me...
So boy guess
I would have to be.
(Whaaa?)

If i was your girlfriend...
(If I was your girl)
I'd have to let you know
(I'd have to let you know)
I only want the "real" thing
(The real thang babe)
Never Putting on a show
(No)

'Cause I don't call attention
I like keeping it on the low
Hush baby...

So, if was your girlfriend,
I'd have to let you know
(Have to let you know)
This is how it's gonna go.

You said to give you a chance,
you reached out your hand

But babe...
Even after a month,
I'll be calling you my boyfriend

And now I'm a power manic,
How i make them boys melt
They tryin' talk to me,
But that's just noise
And I had to making something,
'Cause the kids
Felt Mike Posner should've
Kept the single for himself...
Awkward
