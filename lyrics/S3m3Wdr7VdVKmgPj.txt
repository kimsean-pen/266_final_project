No more of those beautiful boys
No more of those beautiful boys

Born illegitimately to a whore most likely
He became an orphan
Oh, what a lovely orphan
He was sent to the reformatory
Ten years old, it was his first glory
Got caught stealing from a nun
Now his love story had begun

Thirty years he spent wandering
A devil's child with dove wings
Oh, he went to prison
In every country he set foot in
Oh, how he loved - he loved prison
How awfully lovely was prison

All those beautiful boys
Pimps and queens and criminal queers
All those beautiful boys
Tattoos of ships and tattoos of tears

His greatest love was executed
The pure romance was undisputed
Angelic hoodlums and holy ones
Angelic hoodlums and holy ones

All those beautiful boys
Pimps and queens and criminal queers
All those beautiful boys
Tattoos of ships and tattoos of tears

All those beautiful boys
Pimps and queens and criminal queers
All those beautiful boys
Tattoos of ships and tattoos of tears

All those beautiful boys
Beautiful boys

All those beautiful boys
No more of those beautiful boys
No more of those beautiful boys
