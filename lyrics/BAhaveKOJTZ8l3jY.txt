Heh, so I'm out the game huh?
Yo Dre, we ridin'?
Whatup
Well I'm wit'ya homie
Okay, well let's handle the small shit

I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss till I slur up spit
Grew up too quick went through too much knew to much shit
Corrupt and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick 'n' rich, sick and twisted Mr. Buttersworth
Dre tole me to milk this shit for what it's worth
Till the cow just tilts and tips 'n' stumbles to earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep going
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit if I ever take shit, I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him? Wouldn't be shit

Creep with me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age

But what about Jermaine?

Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what your sayin'
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move till I'm provoked
When I see you, I'mma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me, with a buncha little mini-you's
Runnin' around your backyard swimmin' pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with ten or eleven year olds

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh?

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh?

Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amatuers drink veteran piss from a dixie cup
If you ever mix me up or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
Will rub it in, every club your in, we'll have you black balled and make sure you never rap-a-fuckin-gain
Dre ain't havin' it as long as I'm here, play Devil's advocate

If there was some magic shit I could wave over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't, not even if I could

From the hood and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered

And I'mma only sucker punch and swing without warnin'
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off 'cause I know, if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk-rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck, white-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill or grow up to be Atilla, go nuts and be a killer

And I'm somethin of a phenom, one puff of the chron
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us

C'mon!
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh?

Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and Alize, partyin' all day
But I handle my business 'cause it work before play
Don't look for trouble but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you could have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'mma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin' it your way
That goes for anyone who walks threw that doorway
'Cause this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it and you die tryin' to violate it
Fuck around get annihilated, eyes dialated

Like my old lady!
'Cause what you say is what you say
Sometimes what you mean is two different things
Depending on your mood, if it swings, think too many things
Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything
Catch a contact, then I'm gone and I'm back
I speed write and my loose-leaf's my lanch pad

And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head
You headed West, talk shit about Dre?
You better get a vest, then invest in something
To protect your head and neck

And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth
But a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend I'mma die a sudden death
Five mics in The Source, ain't holdin' my fuckin breath
But I suffocate for the respect 'fore I breath to collect a fuckin check

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh?

Watch your fuckin' mouth
Yo this Timbaland, tell him I said suck - ti-tick - my dick
