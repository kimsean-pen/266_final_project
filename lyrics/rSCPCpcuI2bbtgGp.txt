Sister tell wishing well to the young men dead on the shore
She soon died a suicide, kissed the table in god's name
It's the code of the cowboy men to defile all that is pure
Too much hate, too much hate and your ignorance is your strength
Don't sell us Brittanica, with it's oozing pipeline dream
Eat your children baked in a pie, i will blind you to improve
Your visions of I

Bite the face of piety, kiss your mother's broken spirit
There is nothing not even shame
Just the stench from the room full of social animals
Caught again jezebel, with your 'friend' and his beauty bible
He once walked through sacred lands
Now he waves his nazi dagger

Sebastiane

Wish you well sebastiane
With your smiling puritan youth
And you feel, feel no pain
As they cut through your bluey green vein
