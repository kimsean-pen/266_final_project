I see the rain falling down on your lips,
I can see it on your face
And all I hear is this voice synthesize

Most importantly
I know you will see in time
Then you can decide
to hold onto
These arms of mine

But what hurts most of all
Is that we'll never see the sun
The you can decide
To hold onto these arms of mine

Our shadows run
Through the pain in the dark
Are those tears or just lies
My systems down
So go ahead and melt this heart

Most importantly
I know you will see in time
Then you can decide
to hold onto
These arms of mine

But what hurts most of all
Is that we'll never see the sun
The you can decide
To hold onto these arms of mine
