Moving out west, things got lonely
Trying my best, nobody showed me
Which way to go
I didn't know

Hating my past, I found the old me
Bullet proof vest, my only clothing
Hiding alone
Prison is home

Just a man's make up, fake love, make 'em all laugh
Come on, someone, take off your mask
It's nice to meet

Honey, what you done, come from, escaping so fast?
We're from dungeons; Alcatraz
It's nice to meet

Honey, what you done, come from, escaping so fast?

Oooh, it's nice to meet
