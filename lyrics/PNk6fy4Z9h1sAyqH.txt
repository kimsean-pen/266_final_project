Here I am
Prarieland
Got it all, got gun in hand
Here I sleep
Dungarees
That all my husband put on me

We have the stars
We have the trees
We have everything we need to feed

I'll make babes, you'll make chairs
We'll sell them at the country fair
We'll walk on, we'll walk tall
We'll dance once a week [at] the union hall

We'll have the stars
We'll have the trees
We'll have everything we need to feed

Here I am
Prarieland
I got it all, got gun in hand
I'll sweep the porch
I dust his room
We'll sleep together on our chair at noon

We have the stars
We have the trees
We have everything we need to feed

We have the stars
We have the trees
We have everything we need to feed
