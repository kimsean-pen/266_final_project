Deep as the thoughts you left in me
I never meant to keep them in my head
I'm just the way you know you left me
Looking at the hands that kept me fed

I've been wasting all the ways, I could have brought you back
But thats okay, I guess today I'll, care a little less

I wanna just burn
All of the lies that you did believe
I wanna just burn
All of the faith that you had in me
I know we both see, you'll never save me
I think it's time to leave
I wanna just burn
All of the lies that you did believe
I wanna just burn

Deep in the cracks you left in me
I bury belief that keeps me sane
More than a phase, I'm done pretending
Why try to hide this fragile state

I've been wasting all the ways, I coulda brought you back
But thats okay, I guess today I'll, care a little less

I wanna just burn
All of the lies that you did believe
I wanna just burn
All of the faith that you had in me
I know we both see, you'll never save me
I think it's time to leave
I wanna just burn
All of the lies that you did believe
I wanna just burn

I've been wasting all the ways, I coulda brought you back
But thats okay, I guess today, I'll care a little less

I wanna just burn
All of the lies that you did believe
I wanna just burn
All of the faith that you had in me
I know we both see, you'll never save me
I think it's time to leave
I wanna just burn
All of the lies that you did believe
I wanna just burn
