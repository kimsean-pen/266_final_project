I know your folks give you a hard time
But little girl just put your hand in mine
You'll see, what a good good man I'd be

And all your friends, well they say I'm bad
I ain't no different than any other guy you've had
before, except I need you more

You better stop and think it over girl
You better stop and think it over again
think it over again

Though times won't always be as hard as these
Little girl I'm begging on bending knee
Please stay, you're too old to run away

And if you stay right by my side
You know I'll love you 'til the very day I die,
It's true, I love only you

You better stop and think it over girl
You better stop and think it over again
think it over again

I know your folks give you a hard time
Little girl just put your hand in mine
You'll see, what a good good man I'd be

And all your friends, well they say I'm bad
I ain't no different than any other guy you've had
before, except I need you more

You better
Stop, and think it over girl
You better
Stop, and think it over girl
You better
Stop, and think it over
Stop, and think it over
Stop, and think it over
Stop, and think it over
uh huh
Think it over, girl
You've got a big decision
