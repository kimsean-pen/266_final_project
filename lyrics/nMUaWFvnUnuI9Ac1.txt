There's someone dancing through my head, it's not her
I feel so foolish that I let it get this far
These things ain't real and I'm not home
And all the alcohol won't helping my soul to heal, no oh
'Cause when I'm with you I feel so alive
Despite the mistakes I've made I lose all track of time
But when I'm with you I keep losing my mind
And all the mistakes I've made still eat me up inside

And is this heaven
And is this heaven
Or hell I'm living in
If this is heaven
If this is heaven
Then hell comes from within

I always had a way with words and
I used it for myself, didn't care who else along the way got hurt
And now I'm censoring the lines between what I know is wrong
And moving on on from all these countless nights
Oh, she'll talk to you low key
And you act like you know me
But you don't know me at all, no
'Cause when I'm with you I feel so alive
Despite the mistakes I've made I lose all track of time
But when I'm with you I keep losing my mind
And all the mistakes I've made still eat me up inside

And is this heaven
And is this heaven
Or hell I'm living in
If this is heaven
If this is heaven
Then hell comes from within

'Cause I'm moving on in on moving on
Moving on in on moving on
Moving on in on moving on
Moving on in on moving on

And is this heaven
And is this heaven
Or hell I'm living in
If this is heaven
If this is heaven
Then hell comes from within

Is this heaven
Is this heaven
Or hell I'm living in
