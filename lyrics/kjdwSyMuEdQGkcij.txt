I could've found a better way
You know I never should have stayed
I could've done the things I believed were wrong
(You know you're wrong)
Now you're saying that its late
It doesn't matter what I say
You know you're just another one of my mistakes

You are so beautiful, You are the kind of girl
that has the chemicals that makes me fall in love
Beautiful, you are the kinda girl, that has the chemicals
That makes me fall in love

So now i'm feeling like a slave
I'm locked away inside this grave
And i'm hoping for a way I can be saved
You know that there will come a day
when I just have to say, you're just another one of my mistakes

You are so beautiful, You are the kind of girl
that has the chemicals that makes me fall in love
Beautiful, you are the kinda girl, that has the chemicals
That makes me fall in love
Fall in love

You know I found a small paper
You lied about, You lied about
You know I found a small paper
You lied about, You lied about
You lie to me, lie to me

You are so beautiful, You are the kind of girl
that has the chemicals that makes me fall in love
Difficult, so very typical
You are the kinda girl, that makes me fall in love, fall in love
