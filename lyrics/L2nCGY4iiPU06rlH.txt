Honey...
I've been really struggling
To think of you and I being friends
I blow hot and cold
Yeah, I'm like a yo-yo
So I don't think I should see you again

Careless love and
I didn't talk for it wasn't my style
I've had enough
I don't think that we could really be friends

And honey,
I've been really struggling
To think of you and I anonymous
You're off to mourning so
The love you give ebb and flows
So I don't think I should see you again

Careless love and
I didn't talk for it wasn't my style
I've had enough
For I don't think that we can really be friends
But I'll try again

Oh, the love I feel for you it's real
Oh, the love I feel for you it is real

Honey, I've been really struggling to see this thing through
To the end

Careless love
I didn't talk for it wasn't my style
I've had enough
For I don't think that we can really be friends
But I'll try again
