All it takes is a leap of faith
Leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith
All it takes is a leap of faith
Leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith

Broke like shattered glass
You know it's never gonna last
Death is in the room so you better think fast
Eyes like spotlights coming from hell
They're drawing you in with the stories they tell

When the deck is stacked against you and you feel cheated
Don't give up so easy 'cause we know you're not defeated yet
Don't ever listen to what the enemy say
They'll be proven wrong by the end of the day

All it takes
All it takes is a leap of faith
Leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith
All it takes is a leap of faith
Leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith

There's no hidden truth, only destructive lies
Indoctrinated at youth, planned to demoralize
Break the beacon of hope fabricated within
Every heart and soul of every decent human

I made it though times so dark I thought I'd never see light again
And then when the clouds parted I knew I'd see the sun shining in
Don't ever listen to what the enemy say
They'll be proven wrong by the end of the day

All it takes
All it takes is a leap of faith
Leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith
All it takes is a leap of faith
Leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith

When the deck is stacked against you and you feel cheated
Don't give up so easy 'cause we know you're not defeated yet
Don't ever listen what the enemy say
They'll be proven wrong by the end of the day

All it takes
All it takes is a leap of faith
Leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith
All it takes is a leap of faith
Leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith
Leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith, leap of faith
