I'm in a closet and i can't breath
Won't you please release me
I can't move and my kidneys fail
The size of this room feels like jail
I can't talk i can't enunciate
And i'm threatened like sharon tate

Suburban wealth and middle class well being
All it did was strip my feelings
Personality down the drain
Take a bullet to my eyes
Blow them out and see if i die
