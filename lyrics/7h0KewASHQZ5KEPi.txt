Wait, wait, wait, wait
How do you figure?
That you just gon' walk in with us
I don't know you nigga
Give me 50 feet or better
Matter fact give me better
Because if you don't, the wolves behind me
Tellin' me "let me at 'em, let me at 'em"
See God, it ain't me
See God, it ain't me
They 'bout to start a world war
I'm just tryna practice peace
Whole mood 'bout to change
This why I don't come out
'Cause it's always one nigga
Tryna act a fool out here and dumb out

Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Help me, help me

Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Help me, help me
Help me 'cause I don't go out my circle

Now you wanna roll up
Woah, Nelly!
Don't misunderstand me
'Cause I'm understanding you could still get it
Real life here
Ain't no commercials or reruns
No DVRs to start over
Once it's on, it's on
Ain't nothing changing
I'm trying to help you, homie
But you 'bout to wear out my patience
And 'bout to make me get you a room
With all the other patients
Get my drift?
Dig my scene?
Gone 'head be smart my nigga
Gone, leave

I don't rock with you homie
