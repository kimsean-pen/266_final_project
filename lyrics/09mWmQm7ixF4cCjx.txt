I'd rather die for what I believe
Than live a life without meaning.

I'd rather die for what I believe
Than live a life without meaning.
I'd rather die for what I believe
Than live a life without meaning.
I'd rather die for what I believe
Than live a life without meaning.

And now that I'm older...
And now that I'm older
I'm finding out How
What it means
To start over.

Well, it's never gonna be that easy.
I've searched and searched
But the searchlights have left me.
I've tried to find a way, I swear I tried
All I have left is you by my side.

So please take the time
To get inside my mind.

I've longed for the lights
I've stayed awake, stayed awake.
Through the nights.
What if this is all I have
What if this is all that's left
What if this is all that's left
All that's left.

And now that I'm older...
And now that I'm older
I'm finding out how
What it means
To start over.
I never thought I would.
I'm finding out how
What it means
To start over.
Now that I'm older
I'm finding out how
What it means
To start over.

So can you feel it now?
Beneath the surface where the shadows dwell.
You can't hide from the path you chose.
So take it in, take it in
All the burdens of the world

I never thought I'd end up this way.
I never thought I could fall so far away.

So far away.

And now that I'm older...
And now that I'm older
I'm finding out how
What it means
To start over.
I never thought I would
I'm finding out how
What it means
To start over.
And now that I'm older
I'm finding out how
What it means
To start over.
I'm starting over.
I'm starting over.
I'd rather die for what I believe
Than live a life without meaning.
Meaning
Oh
I'm starting over.
