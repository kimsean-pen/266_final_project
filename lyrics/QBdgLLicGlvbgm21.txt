In this blackout inertia will hold our thoughts
And the exit sign offers no light to see by
Can we cast our shadows alone in the dark
I can't see without you

when the world is crashing down,
part with it, start again,
when the world is crashing down,
these notes will fold themselves,
standing at the margin's edge
to see where the daybreak ends
You can find compassion here but the page turns too fast.

We fell in this hole that opened up
givin up on hope, living without love
And we still type black lines
When the world is crashing down
These notes will fold themselves

Adjust the aperture to focus on the negative
Like phosohors in the darkroom ignite'
Like dodging faces in the corner of the print
Frame by frame this hole is opening up and we fall in

Love is love (love) is love (love) is love (love) is love
Love is love (love) is love (love) is love (love) is love

(There's no such thing as whole
There is a hole in the world)
