Sun
Sun

Spirits move me, every time I'm near you
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind
(Tra-la Woah woah)
You're my life line (Woah woah)
Angel of my lifetime
Answer to all answers I can't find

Baby I want you come, come
Come into my arms
Let me feel the wonder of all of you
Could it be magic now, now
Now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last

Sun

Sun
Sun
Take me

Baby take me high upon a hillside
High up where the stallion meets the sun
Ta-da
I could love you
Ya build my world around you
Never leave you 'till my life is done

Baby I want you come, come
Come into my arms
Let me feel the wonder of all of you
Could it be magic now, now
Now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last?

Woah woah woah ta-da
Woah woah woah take me
Woah woah woah ta-da
Woah woah woah
Could it be magic now, now
Now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last?

Baby I want you come, come
Come into my arms
Let me feel the wonder of all of you
Could it be magic now
