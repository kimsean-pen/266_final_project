Talk to me.
Tell me all the tools you need.
To put me back together again.
Oh, I don't think you can.

Sweet morphine.
Sweet relief.
Harass me until they bury me.
I don't mind it's time for me to leave.
It's time that I let go.

Mmm... I'm coming home tonight.
Mmm... I'm coming home.

Doctor, please.
I got someone waiting for me.
Got someone special waiting for me on the other side.
I'm the one who stayed behind.

Young and free.
Oh, we got married at seventeen.
Long ago back when the rainbows were black and white.
Oh, I was beautiful that night.

Mmm... I'm coming home tonight.
Mmm... I'm coming home.
Mmm... I'm coming home tonight.
Mmm... I'm coming home.

Talk to me.
Tell me all the tools you need.
To put me back together again.
Oh, I don't think you can.

Sweet morphine.
Sweet relief.
Harass me until they bury me.
I don't mind it's time for me to leave.
It's time that I let go.

Mmm... I'm coming home tonight.
Mmm... I'm coming home.

Mmm... I'm coming home to night.
Mmm... I'm coming home.
Mmm... I'm coming home tonight.
Mmm... I'm coming home.
