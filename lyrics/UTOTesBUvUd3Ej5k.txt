Set me aflame and cast me free
Away, you wretched world of tethers
Through the endless night and day
I have never wanted more
Always thought that I would stand
Before the faceless name of justice
Like some law unto myself
Like a child of God again

And if rain brings winds of change
Let it rain on us forever
I have no doubt from what I've seen
That I have never wanted more
With this line I'll mark the past
As a symbol of beginning
I have no doubt from what I've seen
I have never wanted more

In this picture stands a man
Far away, alone and distant
Like a solitary field
In some nameless foreign land
All around him points of light
Start to dim and cease transmitting
Shadows fell on futile games
And then there was nothing more
Through the screams of falling steel
By the light of flares and wisdom
All the doubts I could not face
All this time I wanted more
With a line I mark the past
As a symbol of beginning
To the Gods whose names we've lost
And the names who gave in vain

And if rain brings winds of change
Let it rain on us forever
I have no doubt from what I've seen
I have never wanted more
With this line I'll mark the past
As a symbol of beginning
I have no doubt from what I've seen
I have never wanted more

Set me aflame and cast me free
Away, you wretched world of tethers
Through the endless night and day
I have never wanted more
Always thought that I would stand
Before the faceless name of justice
Like some law unto myself
Like a child of God again

And if rain brings winds of change
Let it rain on us forever
I have no doubt from what I've seen
I have never wanted more
With this line I'll mark the past
As a symbol of beginning
I have no doubt from what I've seen
I have never wanted more

Sever the line to the guilty past
To the ones who brought us nothing
Spoke of futures brave and proud
And brought only hate and war
Line the roads with hollow praise
Mark the land with paper statues
Shadows fell on their futile ways
And then there was nothing more
