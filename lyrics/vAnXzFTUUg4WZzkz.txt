All these hoes be grabbin' on me
But bitch I'm swaggin', holy shit
I got a bag of pills up on me
All these drugs feel like I'm laggin'
Homie told me only take them drugs unless you lonely
Bitch, I'm baggin' mostly dope and slowly burnin' crackin open But Bitch I'm jabbin' OG kush and rollin', smokin' like I'm rabid
Foaming at the fucking mouth
I ride a dragon like a pony
Low-key chokin', but I'm braggin'
Boasting I'm a savage, hoes can suck a dick
Ain't nothin' but baggage on me, dragging me down
But I keep bagging trophies

Grippin' and cockin' the Glock
Wet up the block
Lucifer clutching the Ruger
Ay shoutout to all the school shooters
I'm Freddy, I'm Kruger, I'm looper, just trying to maneuver
Got indica all in my lungs, bitch on the phone
The thuggish, the ruggish, no bone
So high that I feel like a drone, leave me alone
Rather take drugs on my own
Don't see you, don't see him, don't see her
$uicide eternal sleeper
Shake hands and shoot dice with the reaper
I've always been eager to meet you
Speaker of all the abandoned
Wishing for death to be granted
Pissing on these ten commandments
This is what the depressed been demandin'
