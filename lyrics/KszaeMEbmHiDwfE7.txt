Made from the most highly complex matter
We've grown through time
Colliding progress with creation
Pushing boundaries of minds and physics

Impacting on each other's life
On each other's destiny
We all imply our own ideology
Leaving behind us the aura
Of a man who once lived

Every decision we take
Every step we make
Every word we use
And every rule we choose

Impacting on each other's life
On each other's destiny
We all imply our own ideology
Leaving behind us the aura
Of a man who once lived

All our actions are impacting
Multiple dimensions
Which makes everyone unique

Even when our world explodes from the inside
We dream to believe
We work to achieve
We are the braves that stand and behave
Conquering our fears
Triumphing over tears

Overcome the obstacles
And perceive our future
Perseverance is the key
Once you reach the summit
You'll finally hear
Surface's echoes
