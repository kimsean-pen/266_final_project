Darling leave the light on for me
Baby I can't sleep
Whatever I do there's no time, little girl
Is there a place I can go?
(La la la la)
If there's a sky that makes me older
(Take my hand for a ride)
Brother fly my backbone across the silver line
(La la la la)
And kiss my head
Take the rain off my shoulders
Off my shoulders
Darling hit that high note for me
Baby I can't sleep
Whatever I do there's no time little girl
Is there a place I can go?
(La la la la)
If there's a sky that makes me older then
(Take my hand for a ride)
Brother fly my backbone across the silver line
(La la la la)
And kiss my head
