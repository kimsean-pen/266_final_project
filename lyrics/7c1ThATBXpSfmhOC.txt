Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love

Kiss the past till it's better
Make it last if you can
Tell me now you regret her
I'll try to understand

What was lost can be regained
All the hurt can be healed
There's no need to feel ashamed
You've come back and I feel afraid

In fact I'm falling in love, falling in love
Falling in love all over again
I'm falling in love, falling in love
Falling in love all over again

I'm falling in love all over again
I'm falling in love with you

Falling
Falling

Say goodnight to your bad dreams
Feel no guilt for what? s done
Another past has been washed clean
And the day has begun

In fact I'm falling in love, falling in love
Falling in love all over again
Falling in love, falling in love
Falling in love all over again

Falling in love, falling in love
Falling in love all over again
Falling in love, falling in love
Falling in love all over again

Falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
In love with you
Falling in love with you

In love with you
Falling in love with you
In love with you
Falling in love with you

I'm falling in love all over again
I'm falling in love with you

Again and again you've got me falling
Again and again falling in love
Again and again you've got me falling
Again and again falling in love

Again and again you've got me falling
Again and again falling in love
Again and again you've got me falling
Again and again falling in love

Again and again you've got me falling
Again and again falling in love
Again and again you've got me falling
Again and again falling in love

Again and again you've got me falling
Again and again falling in love
Again and again you've got me falling
Again and again falling in love

Again and again you've got me falling
Again and again falling in love
Again and again you've got me falling
Again and again falling in love

Again and again you've got me falling
Again and again falling in love
Again and again you've got me falling
Again and again falling in love

Again and again you've got me falling
Again and again falling in love
Again and again you've got me falling
Again and again falling in love

Falling in love
Falling in love with you
Falling in love
Falling in love with you

Falling in love
