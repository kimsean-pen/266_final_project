Don't be afraid yeah, I will stay
Kick our blanket, make it balloon
Hiding inside
I'll blow all of my love to your lips
Love this quiet moment

"Who would you save
If your best mate and
me are drowning?"
"I'll save my friend
'Cause you're like a monk seal"

And you asked
"I love you, how much
Can you love me?"
Mm just without
A thousand words
And then I will say

I love ya
I love ya
I love ya
I love ya

Don't be afraid yeah, I will stay
Hide your little spot
With my ring finger
Let's put a name
On each of your every single hairs
Love this quiet moment

"Who would you save
If your best mate
And me are drowning?"
"I'll save my friend
'Cause you're like a monk seal"

You're like me
And I'm like you
What you're thinking right now
It's always the same as me
That's why I'm so in love

I love ya
I love ya
I love ya
I love ya

Na na na na na, na na
Na na na na na, na na
Na na na na na, na na
Na na na na na, na na

I love ya
I love ya
I love ya
I love ya

I love ya
I love ya
I love ya
I love ya
