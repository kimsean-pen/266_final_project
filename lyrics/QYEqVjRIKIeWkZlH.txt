I'm gettin' out, I'm gettin' out

Sitting here, waiting for someone calling at my door
Too bad, I'm gettin' out of love
What's the use of changin' things?
Wonder what tomorrow brings, who knows?
I'm getttin' out of love

My Shangri-La has gone away
Faded like The Beatles on 'Hey Jude'
She seemed to drift out on the rain
That came in somewhere, softly from the blue

I'm gettin' out, I'm gettin' out

Clouds roll by and hide the sun
Raindrops fallin' on everyone, so sad
I'm getting out of love
Yeah, yeah, yeah

My Shangri-La has gone away
Faded like The Beatles on 'Hey Jude'
She seemed to drift out on the rain
That came in somewhere, softly from the blue

My Shangri-La has gone away
Faded like The Beatles on 'Hey Jude' (Do me, baby)
She seemed to drift out on the rain
That came in somewhere softly from the blue

I'm gettin' out of love
Where is my Shangri-La?
Where is my Shangri-La?
I'm gettin' out of love

I will return
(I will return)
I will return to Shangri-La
(I will return)
I will return to Shangri-La
(I will return)
I will return to Shangri-La
