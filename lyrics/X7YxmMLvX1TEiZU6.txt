It was the year you wouldn't admit it
But you wished so hard that things would fall apart on me
'Cause I ruined you when I couldn't quit it
You lost your mind over mine and I gave up
"This cycle is getting old," (you said so... you said so)
We crossed the line some time ago

'Cause tonight your hair falls around your ears and it makes me want
to stay. But I'm keeping at a distance for all
the decisions that I've made to be gone, to stay gone
To be everything that you thought
It's all I've got

It's been a month and I'll admit it
I lost your eyes over time and I gave up
'Cause nobody likes slipping out the back door
But I can't crawl back to you anymore
We crossed the line some time ago

Want to stay. But I'm keeping at a distance for all
the decisions that I've made to be gone, to stay gone
To be everything that you thought
It's all I've got

Nobody likes slipping out the back door
But this is stubborn, yeah this is stubborn love
Yeah, this is stubborn, yeah this is stubborn love

But tonight your hair falls around your ears and it makes me want to
leave. 'Cause I just can fake
tomorrow and live with the someone I might be
So I'm gone, yeah I'm gone
'Cause I'm everything that you thought
'Cause I'm everything that you're not
It's all I've got

Yeah, this is stubborn, yeah this is stubborn love
Yeah, this is stubborn, yeah this is stubborn love
