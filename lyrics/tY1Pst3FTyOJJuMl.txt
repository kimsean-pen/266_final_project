YEAH, I WANNA BE FAMOUS
WON'T STOP CHASING THE DREAM TILL I REACH THE TOP
Walking through the flames searching for glory
I'm gonna be somebody

I'M NOT AFRAID
I'VE LIVED A LIFE OF BLOOD, SWEAT, SACRIFICE
NO, IT'S NEVER BEEN EASY
DOES IT KILL YOU THAT I'M STILL BREATHING?
YOU TOLD ME TO WAKE UP
PUT TWO FEET ON THE GROUND AND GET A REAL JOB
I SWEAR I'LL NEVER BE A SLAVE TO CONFORMITY

I'm not afraid to take this chance
To walk this world where no one stands

I'M SO FUCKING SICK OF THESE WORDS OF JUDGEMENT
YOU LIVE A LIFE THAT'S WORTHLESS
YOU'VE GOT A DEAD-END JOB, CHOKING ON DEBT
WHY WOULD I BE SO ENVIOUS?
I HOPE IT WAS WORTH IT
YOU THINK YOU'RE SO DAMN PERFECT
You Can't Deny The Truth I See
I'M EVERYTHING YOU'LL NEVER BE

I'm not afraid to take this chance
To walk this world
I'll never say I'm sorry
It's never too late to chase the glory
I won't change my story
I'm not afraid, I'll be always searching (Searching, searching)

I'M NOT AFRAID
IT'S TIME TO TAKE THIS CHANCE
I'M NOT AFRAID
I KNOW YOU'D LOVE TO SEE ME FAIL
BUT I'LL NEVER LET YOU TEAR ME DOWN

YEAH, I'M GONNA BE FAMOUS
WON'T STOP CHASING THE DREAM TILL I REACH THE TOP
WALKING THROUGH THE FLAMES SEARCHING FOR VICTORY

I'll never say I'm sorry
It's never too late to chase the glory
I won't change my story
I'm not afraid, I'll be always searching
Always searching
I'll be always searching (Always searching)
Always searching (Always searching)
I'll be always searching
Always searching (Always searching)
Always searching
I'll be always searching
Always searching (Always searching)
Always searching
I'll be always searching
Always searching...
