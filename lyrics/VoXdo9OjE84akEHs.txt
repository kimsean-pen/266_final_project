I don't really know how I got so far from me
It feels like we started at the end of a story
End of a story
End of a story

When we drove out from California
Wheels turning around my mind
Tell me, why are we still saying "I'm sorry"
for the things that we left behind?

Stay
Stay
Stay
Stay
Stay
Stay
Stay with me
Me
Me
Me
Me
Me

We keep running in circles
Rising and falling
But I don't wanna stop now
No, I'm not sorry
I'm not sorry
I'm not sorry

When we drove out from California
Wheels turning around my mind
Tell me, why are we still saying "I'm sorry"
For the things that we left behind?

No, I'm not sorry
