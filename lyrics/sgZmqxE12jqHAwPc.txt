never forget its what you ask... for
show no regret,
show no regret
but at what cost
what am I giving up
but at what cost
I always find myself here
Give up the fight
you're not a winner
move tward the light
give up the fight
but at what cost
what am i giving up
but at what cost
I always find myself here (here 2x)
(show no regrets)
(instrument)
i am the world the world is me without the peace and harmony this is your life
