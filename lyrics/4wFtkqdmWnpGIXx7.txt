A toast to the last of the dying breed
They're crawling back to bed
They're falling back to sleep
A chill touches the base of your neck
Who'd call by at this hour
Who's standing out my step?

Alright, we tried to help
Alright, we tried to help
So pull back the covers tonight

I mean, correct me if I'm wrong
That end was meant for you
Since before you were born
So here's to the last of the dying breed
They're crawling back to bed
They're falling back to sleep

Alright, we tried to help
Alright, we tried to help

The shift's up and you've got no act
loosen up those muscles and straighten up that back

Alright, we tried to help
Alright, we tried to help
So pull back the covers tonight

A toast to the last of the dying breed
They're crawling back to bed
They're falling back to sleep
A toast to the last of the dying breed
They're crawling back to bed
They're falling back to sleep
