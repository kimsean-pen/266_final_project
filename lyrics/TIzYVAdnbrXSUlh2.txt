Facing fear, facing birth
The emptiness, the void, the dreams
Unfold
Burning shrouds, the air is cold
The memories of time and space
Unknown
Sleeping tight in rising flames
A mind evokes, the self returns
Unhurt
Seeing life, through the clouds
Abandoning the womb, a seed
Untouched

Like a sea of hope
Assembling forces of old
By the betrayer's funeral pyre
Building with fire!
Like a field with endless harvest
The first breath we take
Uruz awakes, reaching higher
Building with fire!

Like a hammer of thoughts
Our minds reborn
What the inner I desire
Building with fire!

Come and feel the silence
Come and watch the sun
Come and bid farewell
Tales will be told
Tales will be ignored
Tales will once again destroy

Facing fear, facing birth
The emptiness, the void, the dreams
Unfold
Burning shrouds, the air is cold
The memories of time and space
Unknown
Sleeping tight in rising flames
A mind evokes, the self returns
Unhurt

A picture from a dream forms a destiny
The circle of life bound to be broken

The gods cannot elude the pain
A path in time built with fire

Facing fear, facing birth
The emptiness, the void, the dreams
Unfold
Burning shrouds, the air is cold
The memories of time and space
Unknown
Sleeping tight in rising flames
A mind evokes, the self returns
Unhurt
Seeing life, through the clouds
Abandoning the womb, a seed
Untouched
