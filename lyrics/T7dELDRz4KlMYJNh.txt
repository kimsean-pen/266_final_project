If you're searching out for something
Don't try so hard
If you're feeling kind of nothing
Don't try so hard

When your problems seem like mountains
Feel the need to find some answers
You can leave them for another day
Don't try so hard

But if you fall and take a tumble
It won't be far
If you fail, you mustn't grumble
Thank your lucky stars

Just savour every mouthful
And treasure every moment
When the storms are raging 'round you
Stay right where you are

Don't try so hard
Don't take it all to heart
It's only fools, they make these rules
Don't try so hard

One day, you'll be a sergeant major
You'll be so proud
Screaming out your bloody orders
Hey!, but not too loud

Polish all your shiny buttons
Dressed as lamb instead of mutton
But you never had to try
To stand out from the crowd

What a beautiful world
This is the life for me
What a beautiful world
Is the simple life for me

Don't try so hard
Don't take it all to heart
It's only fools, they make these rules
Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard
