As I was roaming through
The vast and sacred valley
At the heart of the clearing
I saw a woman who approached me

She had old, wise, tired eyes
And markings on her cheeks
She told me of the meads where enlightenment
Could be achieved

I set off as dawn broke
And I walked on down stream
Whilst my eyes strained to pierce
The haze of my lucid dreams

I don't want to lose the feeling
I've searched so hard to find the meaning
I've found the door and I'm kind of hoping
To use my head and crack it open

As I came down from the hills
Away from the crying churned up storm
I saw a land through the deepening dusk
And I knew true, what I had been told

I want this vibrant grass to cover me
If I become too overwrought
For the salvation that I seek
Is trapped in the silence between my thoughts

I don't want to lose the feeling
I've searched so hard to find the meaning
I've found the door and I'm kind of hoping
To use my head and crack it open

I don't want to lose the feeling
I don't want the strange to slip away
I seek to find true meaning
To find a true and better place to stay

I don't want to lose the feeling
I've searched so hard to find the meaning
I've found the door and I'm kind of hoping
To use my head and crack it open
