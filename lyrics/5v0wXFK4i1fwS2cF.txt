you
are driving me out of my mind
cause you
take me everywhere but out at night

what more
do you need
for me to get with you

i didnt see this coming
why dont you start me up?
theres no more messing around
(come on and light me up)
this could be the start of something
why dont you party up?
time for you to come on down

la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

i
dream about it in my sleep
you
seem to like me better when i creep

this time
i wont lose

i didnt see this coming
why dont you start me up?
theres no more messing around
(come on and light me up)
this could be the start of something
why dont you party up?
time for you to come on down

la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

hey
you roll me
you use me
you love me and then
you wrap me up
and reel me in
and use me again

you love me
you hate me
you say its the end
i know youre gonna do it
again and again and again and again and again and
hey

i didnt see this coming
why dont you start me up?
theres no more messing around
(come on and light me up)
this could be the start of something
why dont you party up?
time for you to come on down

come on and party up

i didnt see this coming
why dont you start me up?
theres no more messing around
come on and party up
this could be the start of something
why dont you party up?
time for you to come on down
