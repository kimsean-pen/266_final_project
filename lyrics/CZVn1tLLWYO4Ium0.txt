All my people in the crowd
Grab a partner, take it down
It's me against the music
Uh huh
It's just me
And me
Yeah
C'mon
Hoh!
Hey, Britney?
Are you ready?
Uh huh, are you?
Uh!

And no one cares
It's whippin' my hair, it's pullin' my waist
To hell with stares
The sweat is drippin' all over my face
And no one's there
I'm the only one dancin' up in this place
Tonight I'm here
Feel the beat of the drum, gotta keep with that bass

I'm up against the speaker, tryna take on the music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in the zone, I wanna get in the zone
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
Tryin' to hit it, chic-ih-taa!
In a minute I'ma take you on, I'ma take you on
(Hey, hey, hey)

All my people on the floor, let me see you dance (let me see ya)
All my people wantin' more, let me see you dance (I wanna see ya)
All my people round and round, let me see you dance (let me see ya)
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance (I wanna see ya)

How would you like a friendly competition? Let's take on the song
(Let's take on the song, let's take on the song)
It's you and me baby, we're the music, time to party all night long
(All night long, all night long)

We're almost there
I'm feelin' it bad and I can't explain
My soul is bare
My hips are movin' at a rapid pace
Can you feel it burn?
From the tip of my toes, runnin' through my veins
And now's your turn
Let me see what you got, don't hesitate

I'm up against the speaker, tryna take on the music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in the zone, I wanna get in the zone
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
Tryin' to hit it, chic-ih-taa!
In a minute I'ma take you on, I'ma take you on
(Hey, hey, hey)

All my people on the floor, let me see you dance (let me see ya)
All my people wantin' more, let me see you dance (I wanna see ya)
All my people round and round, let me see you dance (let me see ya)
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance (I wanna see ya)

Get on the floor, baby, lose control
Just work your body and let it go
If you wanna party, just grab somebody
Hey, Britney, we can dance all night long

Hey, Britney, you say you wanna lose control
Come over here, I got somethin' to show ya
Sexy lady, I'd rather see you bare your soul
If you think you're so hot, better show me what you got
(Hey, hey, hey)

All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
C'mon, Britney, lose control, watch you take it down

Get on the floor, baby, lose control
Just work your body and let it go
If you wanna party, just grab somebody
Hey, Britney, we can dance all night long

All my people on the floor, let me see you dance (let me see ya)
All my people wantin' more, let me see you dance (I wanna see ya)
All my people round and round, let me see you dance (let me see ya)
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance (I wanna see ya)

All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
C'mon, Britney, take it down, make the music dance
All my people round and round, party all night long
C'mon, Britney, lose control, watch you take it down
