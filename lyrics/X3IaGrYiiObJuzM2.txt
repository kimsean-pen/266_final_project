Don't pull your pants before I go down
Don't turn away this is my time
Don't make demands, I don't take none
Just say a prayer that it gon' get done

Don't pull your pants before I go down
Don't turn away this is my time
Like a shotgun needs an outcome
I'm your prostitute, you gon' get some!
Like a shotgun needs an outcome
I'm your prostitute, you gon' get some!

Go ahead, go way low, where I can do no harm
Go ahead, go way low in my honey loving' arms
Go ahead, go way low, where I can do no wrong
Got you around my finger like a lonely lovers charm
Like a lonely lovers charm

And cause I can I'm gon' go west
Just like a man, I'm the fortress
Like the shotgun I can't be outdone
I'm your prostitute, you gon' get some
Like the shotgun needs an outcome
I'm your prostitute, you gon' get some!

Go ahead, go way low, where I can do no harm
Go ahead, go way low in my honey loving' arms
Go ahead, go way low, where I can do no wrong
Got you around my finger like a lonely lovers charm

Go ahead, go way low, where I can do no harm
Go ahead, go way low in my honey loving' arms
Go ahead, go way low, where I can do no wrong
Got you around my finger like a lonely lovers charm
Like a lonely lovers charm
Like a lonely lovers charm
