You know, I feel like the world got smaller
I recall all of the days I've cried
Even if Heaven doesn't take us, we tried
But you know, I think if we stick together
Maybe we'll become each other's guide
I know we'll make it out of this one alive

And we'll be alright
Revolution lover
And we'll be alright
Revolution lover
And we'll be alright
Revolution lover
And we'll be alright
Revolution lover

You know, I know that your hope's been missing
I know we both coulda almost died
I know it's harder everyday to provide
But it's gonna change, I can feel it coming
And when it's here, we'll be side-by-side
I know we'll make it out of this one alive

And we'll be alright
Revolution lover
And we'll be alright
Revolution lover
And we'll be alright
Revolution lover
And we'll be alright
Revolution lover

I'm yours, I'm yours
I'm yours, I'm yours
I'm yours, I'm yours
I'm yours, I'm yours
I'm yours, I'm yours
I'm yours, I'm yours
I'm yours, I'm yours
I'm yours
