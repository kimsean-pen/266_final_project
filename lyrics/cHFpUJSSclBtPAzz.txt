I can just imagine you and me
Running out of steam
Going through the motions
And I have no idea how you know

When I dip my toes
In other people's oceans
Cause you had a local knowledge of the local area
And that impressed me quite

So I tried that night

To do all the things I thought you'd like but that just made it worse
And I impressed you not, well not a lot
So we started from the start
When the heat dies down I'll be back in town

And until our time I'll be round at mine
When the heat dies down I'll be back in town
And until our time I'll be round at mine
When the heat dies down

When the heat dies down
When the heat dies down
When the heat dies down
Aaaaaaaaaaah

Aaaaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaaaah

Aaaaaaaaaaah

Aaaaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaaaah
I can not imagine growing old
To have and to hold

Till death to part each other
Cause I doubt I could stomach 20 years
Spending time at hers
Talking to that Mother

Cause I got a wider knowledge of the world I just can't face
I know the argument about the rent
It all seems unimportant in the grander scheme of things
Cause I was purpose built
To not feel guilt
So we ended at the end
When the heat dies down I'll be back in town
And until our time I'll be round at mine
When the heat dies down I'll be back in town
And until our time I'll be round at mine
When the heat dies down
When the heat dies down
When the heat dies down
When the heat dies down
Aaaaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaaaah
When the heat dies down
The heat dies down
When the heat dies down
When the heat dies down
