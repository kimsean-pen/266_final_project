And I'm sick thinking 'bout you when you're not with me
No, this ain't healthy

Don't even smile, don't even look at me (don't look)
Don't say the words you know it's gon' happen
'Cause only you know what it does to me
Heartbeat fast like it's tryna run from me
I'm losing sleep, they said that would happen (they said that would)
First one I hit up, when something good happens
I'm going through it, but this is not normal (no)
Now a man's buying everything you want for you

And when you hit that dunk
You know I'm right there with you (dunk it)
I'll pass it right back to you, girl let me assist you
You don't understand how much I stan us
When you're standing next to me I pull a Stan and throw up

Nobody knows what it feels like
Nobody knows how to help me
And I'm starting to think there's something wrong with me
No, this ain't healthy
How much I think about you every day
There's no counting all the miles I go out my way (yeah)
And I'm sick thinking 'bout you when you're not with me (oh yeah)
No, this ain't healthy

Don't even smile, (hey) don't even start laughing
Stop being cute (stop) you know it's gon' happen (gon' happen)
Just like my heart about to sky rockin' (shoo)
Got me all tense like I'm out here pop-locking (yeah)

And when you hit that dunk
You know I'm right there with you (I'm with you)
Yeah, even when you're in my arms I kinda miss you
You don't understand how much I stan us
When you're standing next to me I pull a Stan and throw up

Nobody knows what it feels like (nobody knows)
Nobody knows how to help me (uh uh)
And I'm starting to think there's something wrong with me
No, this ain't healthy
How much I think about you every day
There's no counting all the miles I go out my way
(Yeah, I go so many miles)
And I'm sick thinking 'bout you when you're not with me
No, this ain't healthy

And in my heart it feels like no one else would ever fault you
And I'm sorry for the times you ever
Thought that I'd ignored you (so sorry girl)
I'm sorry bae that's just the way it works
You get that feeling in me jumping when you flirt
So when you come around me wearing that
Yeah, I might be smiling but it hurts
And nobody knows

Nobody knows what it feels like (nobody knows)
Nobody knows how to help me (how to help me)
And I'm starting to think there's something wrong with me
(Something wrong)
No, this ain't healthy (this ain't healthy)
How much I think about you every day (let's go, let's go)
There's no counting all the miles I go out my way
And I'm sick thinking 'bout you when you're not with me
No, this ain't healthy

And I'm sick thinking 'bout you when you're not with me
No, this ain't healthy
