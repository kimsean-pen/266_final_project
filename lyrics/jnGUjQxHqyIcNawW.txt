Wrapped around your finger
I'd spent my whole life
Tied in ways to have you
And everything was alright
Almost but not quite
I'd be tanlged up without you
Oh, a mess
Like a nightmare in an empty bed
With you it's like I'm coming home again

Baby you're hands down the best thing
about me
And baby I don't know where I was
But I'm so glad you found me.

Wrapped inside your sheets
Well, I look up to you
Because you look after me
And kiss me till I bleed
I don't want anything
But all of you
I know I swore, I said:
"I'll never love again."
But man, oh man, you're my best friend.

Baby you're hands down the best thing
about me
And baby I don't know where I was

But I'm so glad you found me.

Baby
You know I love you
More than my words
Know how to show you.
Baby
You know I love you
More than my words
Know how to show you.
Baby
You know I love you
More than my words
Know how to show you.
Baby
You know I love you
More than my words
Know how to show you.
Baby
You know I love you
More than my words
Know how to show you.
I will show you.
