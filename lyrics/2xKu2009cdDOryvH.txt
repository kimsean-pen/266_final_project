Next phase, next craze, next nothing new
Got the pretty boy beat him up black and blue
Broke the sissy boy's teeny toy heart in two
Turned him into a video kid like you

I know we're just pretending
There's no window for mistakes
I know you see right through me
There's no promise left to break

Shot the pretty boy killed him on Commodore
Need a new game, need a new something more
Got a new face got a new way to score
Got a voice like something I've heard before

I know we're just pretending
There's no window for mistakes
I know you see right through me
There's no promise left to break

The message misleading
We're lying, we're cheating
We're only repeating
The motions preceding

I know we're just pretending
There's no window for mistakes
I know you see right through me
There's no promise left to break
