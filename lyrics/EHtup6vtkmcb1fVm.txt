I saw it
Hit the ground
But no one
Was around

Can you even tell me that no one is the same as you
Same as you
Nation walking racket wall of guns sing straight out
As you
As you

There were ticking bloody watches in our hands
Important to the soil to make ladders
Have another heart attack before the numb bark chairs
Open up your mouth where you want to go

I can hardly recognize the shapes
The shapes
Wandering through Chinatown once times every artificial need
Artificial need
Slip down open over such small teeth
Alright
