I want to live where soul meets body
And let the sun wrap its arms around me and
Bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing
And feel- feel what it's like to be new

'Cause in my head, there's a Greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts, to far-off destinations
So they may have a chance, of finding a place where they're
Far more suited than here

I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt, with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands, can wash one another's
And not one speck will remain

I do believe it's true, that there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too
So brown eyes I'll hold you near, 'cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

Where a soul meets body
Where a soul meets body
Where a soul meets body

And I do believe it's true, that there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too
So brown eyes, I'll hold you near, 'cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
