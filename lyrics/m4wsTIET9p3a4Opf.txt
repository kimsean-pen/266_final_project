Go be the voice of God
Go live the life putting death to shame
Go be the voice of God
Go live the life putting death to shame

I wasn't force fed what I think
And I don't care if you think I'm brainwashed for what I believe
But it sure wasn't from people reminding me
That I'm still a failure every Sunday morning

It's my fault, it's always my fault
Every time I have a problem that can't be solved
It's my fault, it's always my fault
Every time I have a problem that can't be solved

Go be the voice of God
Go live the life putting death to shame
Go be the voice of God
Go live the life putting death to shame

Tell me I've made progress
All I want is to make you proud
Are the lungs in my chest still working?
'Cause sometimes I want to shout where's my savior now?

Life and death is all perspective
Life and death is all perspective
Let's go!
Just don't give up, it's not worth it
Life and death is a matter of perspective
Give in, you know it's your purpose
Even if you know you'll never deserve it

Go be the voice of God
Go live the life putting death to shame
Go be the voice of God
Go live the life putting death to shame

Tell me I've made progress
All I want is to make you proud
Are the lungs in my chest still working
'Cause sometimes I want to shout where's my savior now?

Tell me I've made progress
All I want is to make you proud
Are the lungs in my chest still working
'Cause sometimes I want to shout where's my savior now?

God where are you, God where are you now?

There's no substance, nothing's real anymore
But I'm still swinging, fighting like never before

Go be the voice of God
Go live the life putting death to shame
Go be the voice of God
Go live the life putting death to shame
Go be the voice of God
Go live the life putting death to shame
Go be the voice of God
Go live the life putting death to shame
