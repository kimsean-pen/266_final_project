Chance, gave its light tonight
Stars are aligned
Sweetest thing to cross my eyes
Crossed my life

Hold me tonight
Night after night
What a place to be alive
Here by your side
From silence we rise
Arise

Chance, gave sign tonight
Stars are aligned
Sweetest thing to cross my mind
Crossed my life

Hold me tonight
Night after night
What a bliss to be alive
Here by your side
From silence we rise
What a bliss to be alive
