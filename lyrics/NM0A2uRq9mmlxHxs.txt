Give me a second light I haven't smiled since yesterday
If I need to I can pay, but lemme hold this till I feel ok
Since you burned me at the stake, all of my feelings went away
There's no feelings in my way, at least there's no feelings in my way

I was there when you were blind to everything that I could see
I'll pretend that it's just me, but maybe really it's just me
I forgot what it was like, to think I found you finally
What if you were the one for me? I hope you weren't the one for me

And I know this
I can't read it right, between the fights
I still need you
And I know this
I fell for your eyes, I just realized
I still need you
I still need you

Give me 'til twenty-three, I need another year for this
Trying to teach my common sense to not waiver with my confidence
Traded my soul to free my mind, car mix to help me pass the time
Can I go back to being blind
Asked myself why one too many times
ADVERTISING

And I know this
I can't read it right, between the fights
I still need you
And I know this
I fell for your eyes, I just realized
I still need you
I still need you

I tried to say thank you, but I don't know if you heard me
I know it wasn't your plan, to just be the one to hurt me
My thoughts versus my feelings, my thoughts on you hit the ceiling
But my feelings aren't a real thing
If I feel things I don't really discern

And I know this
I can't read it right, between the fights
I still need you
And I know this
I fell for your eyes, I just realized
I still need you

And I know this
I can't read it right, between the fights
I still need you
And I know this
I fell for your eyes, I just realized
I still need you 5x
