Once I had a little man, sometimes I think about him,
Buddy, you know he not really here.
When memories don't call, I just can't live without him
But I'm tryin all the time is so hard to bear.
Heartbreaker, can't take him,
Heartbreaker, bringing me down.
Heartbreaker, can't take him,
Heartbreaker, breaking me down.
I don't cry no more, I live while I'm flying,
Passing by, and you can hear me say:
Heartbreaker, can't take him,
Heartbreaker, bringing me down.
Heartbreaker, can't take him,
Heartbreaker, breaking me down.
Heartbreaker, can't take him,
Heartbreaker, bringing me down.
Heartbreaker, can't take him,
Heartbreaker, breaking me down.
Heartbreaker, can't take him,
Heartbreaker, bringing me down.
Heartbreaker, can't take him,
Heartbreaker, breaking me down.
Heartbreaker,
Oh breaking me down
Oh baby, oh baby
Heartbreaker, can't take him,
Heartbreaker, bringing me down.
Heartbreaker, can't take him,
Heartbreaker, breaking me down.
