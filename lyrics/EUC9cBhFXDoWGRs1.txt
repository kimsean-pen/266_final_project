Packed all my clothes, shut the door
Back on the road to success
Hopped in my two-seater, just me and the dream beating the pavement
Stick to the hurts and burst spitting words of encouragement, baby
And if you feel what I'm feeling
Then don't be scared to say it with me, say...

I got this, every single breath another step on my road
I got this, I'm from the south side trying to get to my goal
I got this, ain't no stopping me
Come on follow me if you feel the need
I got this, better believe I got this, believe I got this

So many tried to break me
When I got up they knocked me down
Didn't keep me from moving
I flip the world upside down
They said the sky was the limit
I put my footprint all in it
'Cause I've been there
I'm looking down at the moon
And if you feel like I do
Put your hands in the air

I got this, every single breath another step on my road
I got this, I'm from the south south trying to get to my goal
I got this, ain't no stopping me
Come on follow me if you feel the need
I got this, better believe I got this, believe I got this

Gravity's mad at me 'cause when I fall I won't drop
Something in me won't let me stop until I reach the top
I keep going, I keep showing the whole world everyday I'm growing
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything in me says I got this

I got this, every single breath another step on my road
I got this, I'm from the south south trying to get to my goal
I got this, ain't no stopping me, come on follow me if you feel the need
I got this, better believe I got this, believe I got this
I got this, I got this, yeah, I got this, said I got this, yeah
I got this, I know you know I got this, you better know I got it, you got it
I got this, you know it, I got this, yeah, yeah
