Voiceless Words birth terror
A body without substance or form casts such horrid shadows

Your gaze
Your gaze unseen

Pierced my heart
Pierced my heart

Pierced my soul
Pierced my soul

I was within you
You were without
And you were within me
You showed me the living darkness

"That which is dead desires to be born
That which is born is destined to die"

You showed me the living darkness
The night beyond night

"The devil is coming out...
The devil is coming out...
The devil is coming out of me..."

You marked me
Long ago
And I shall seek you
Eternally
