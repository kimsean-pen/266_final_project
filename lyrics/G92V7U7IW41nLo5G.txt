Oh, you see the look in her eyes
I don't know what you see in her style
Half poison, half god
Half poison, half god

Oh, she's just like you and me, she
She can't control her dreams
She's half death, half life
Half death, half life

She's half poison, half life

Oh, you see the look in her eyes
I know just what you see in her now
