The fire, my head's all wired
In plain view, there's nothing in the way
I see with clarity the eye of destiny
But just a little spark, and once again, I don't know

Deep inside the memories that are left behind
Close my eyes, I've been hopelessly lost in the fear

Are we the only ones?
It's all dark in here
Do I just waste my time
Searching for exits in infinite space?

Deep inside the memories that are left behind
Close my eyes, I've been hopelessly lost in the fear
Are you for real?

All the lights, all the lights
Is that the future or another lullaby?

The fire, my head's all wired
In plain view, there's nothing in the way
I see with clarity the eye of destiny

Deep inside the memories that are left behind
Close my eyes, I've been hopelessly lost in the fear
Deep inside, the memories that are left behind
Close my eyes, I've been hopelessly lost in the fear
