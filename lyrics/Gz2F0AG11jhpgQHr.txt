He said "You are mine my child
Come away with me
I spread my wings to carry you
I will set you free"
The wind is howling hard tonight
A shiver down my spine
"Maybe you live on my child
In someone's memory?"

Oh Izrael - Oh Izrael

Archangel of holy death
Standing at my feet
Take me to the other side
In your wings I'll sleep
Carry me across the night
In your arms I'm free
Angel of the south to take me
to new reality

Oh Izrael - Oh Izrael

"Come
Come away with me
I will take you
Take you under my wings
Where you will sleep eternally
I will take you
Take you away"

He said "You are mine my child
Come away with me
I spread my wings to carry you
I will set you free"
The wind is howling hard tonight
A shiver down my spine
"Maybe you live on my child
In someone's memory?"

Oh Izrael - Oh Izrael
