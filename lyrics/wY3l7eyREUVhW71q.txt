These are strange days for you, me, and Germany
These are strange days we find ourselves in
These are strange days for you, me, and Germany
But, we have Honour, and with that we (we'll) win!
I had a fight with 3 piggies
Your enemy seems to be within
These are strange days for you, me, and Germany
But, we struggle, and together we'll win!

These are strange days for you, me, and Germany
The storm clouds are gathered and gray
These are strange days for you, me, and Germany
So we find ourselves here today.

Snakes and devils surround us
Friends are few and rare indeed
Pig upon pig-dog will hound us
But, we get stronger as they inbreed.
