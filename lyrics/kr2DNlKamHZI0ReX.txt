I'm coming up man-sized
Skinned alive, I want to fit
Mmm, I've got to get
Man-sized

I'm headin' on handsome
Got my leather boots on
Got my girl and she's a wow
I cast my iron knickers down

Man-size no need to shout
Can you hear, can you hear me now?

I'm man-sized
Man-sized

I'll measure time, I'll measure height
I'll calculate my birthright
Good Lord I'm big
I'm headin' on

I'm man-sized
Got my leather boots on
Got my girl and she's a wow
I cast my iron knickers down

Man-sized no need to shout
Can you hear, can you hear me now?

My babe looking cool and neat
I'm pretty sure good enough to eat
Man-sized no need to shout
Let it all, let it all hang out

Man-size, man-size
Man-size, man-size
Man-size, man-size
Man-size, man-size

Silence my lady head
Get girl out of my head
Douse her with gasoline
Set it light and set it free
