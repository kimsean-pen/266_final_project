He's my confession
I've got a death wish
I'm in the fast lane
Addicted to excess

Living my best life
I was on top rise
Sipping the limelight
Attiring the headlight

My future used to shine
Is bright like a diamond
Where the time go
I was too high
He was drive me
Now I meet stop
But Lord you seem crying
Lord you seem crying
Oh my dear Lord

I've been running wild
Had a good time
But I can't stop now
Oh my dear Lord

Over my head in the landslide
Can you pull me out?
Oh my dear Lord
Oh my dear Lord
Oh my dear Lord

I've been running wild
Had a good time
But I can't stop now
Oh my dear Lord
Oh my dear Lord

I was a good guy
But was worst type
Give me an inch man
I'll take a mile
I'm walking back now
Hustle on fires
Driving a van now
I grab the lighter

My future used to shine
Is bright like a diamond
Where the time go
I was too high
He was drive me
Now I meet stop
But Lord you seem crying
Lord you seem crying
Oh my dear Lord

I've been running wild
Had a good time
But I can't stop now
Oh my dear Lord

Over my head in the landslide
Can you pull me out?
Oh my dear Lord
Oh my dear Lord
Oh my dear Lord

I've been running wild
Had a good time
But I can't stop now
Oh my dear Lord

Yeeh, yeeh

Oh my dear Lord

Yeeh, yeeh

There's been a time
There's been a pushing, pushing magazines
Breaking bones and taking everything in front of me
Praising bags that is looking not to heavy from their means

Been a time,
Been a pusher, pushing my disease
Breaking bones and taking everything in front of me
Praising beggars looking up to heaven from their knees

Is anyone listening?
Is anyone listening?
Is anyone listening?

Oh my dear Lord
I've been running wild
Had a good time
But I can't stop now
Oh my dear Lord

Over my head in the landslide
Can you pull me out?
Oh my dear Lord
Oh my dear Lord
Oh my dear Lord

I've been running wild
Had a good time
But I can't stop now
Oh my dear Lord

Oh my dear Lord
