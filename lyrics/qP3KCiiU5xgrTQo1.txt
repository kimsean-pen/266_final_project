My eyes glazed and my fingers cold
My body aches, this is getting old
From the first drip to the seventh hole
Ooh, it's hard to quit, this is getting old

All my dreams get soaked in the night
I need some light to keep them dry

Pour me another, light me another
I wish I could be a saint like my mother
'Cause we live the same, we die the same way
I would be proud to call you my brother
Yeah I would be proud to call you my brother

Oh his heart's asleep but it's all I've known
And it hurts to speak, this is getting old
From morning sun to the evening glow
I'm a nervous wreck, this is getting old

All my dreams get soaked in the night
I need some light to keep them dry

Pour me another, light me another
I wish I could be a saint like my mother
'Cause we live the same, we die the same way
I would be proud to call you my brother
('Cause we live the same, we die the same way)
Yeah I would be proud to call you my brother
(We live the same, we die the same way)
(We live the same, we die the same way)
We live the same, yeah we die the same way, oh
