I feel like i was born with a chip on my shoulder
Gettin' older, feelin' numb fuck the pain, yeah
Gettin' sober, i'm alone, i fell, trip
Not a smoker, black lungs, i'm a fool, yeah
I'm a loner (yes)
I was smooth MJ
Billie died last May
Couldn't hold back tears
Swept up and away
Call me back and tell me things
Tell me that i'm fuckin' great
Best rapper to fuckin' live
Tell me that i make you proud
Tell me that you want my kids
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Love is just a fuckin' sin
Désolé, désolé

Lust things on the back of my bed i feel high

She be steallin' hoddies, always ketchup on her fries
Never let a shorty tell you promises and lies
Pussy niggas messagin' me all the fucking time
Hey there, wellfare got me online
Wanna smoke weed, i wanna change lives
Wanne be the saddest nigga no one eve-
Wanna be the saddest nigga no one ever likes
Wanna sell your soul or wanna fuckin' die
(Wanna sell your soul or wanna fucking die)
