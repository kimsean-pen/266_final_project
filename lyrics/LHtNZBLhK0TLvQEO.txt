This is it, now it's in our hands
I know you feel it
We could have quit but we choose to dance
B-best believe it

We took it in baby from the start
We chased the light and forgot the dark
So paint this moment with a million stars stars
So everybody sing with me

Let me see your hands up high
Don't wait own it because tonight
We're flying free like birds in the sky
Cause we're alive (live)
Let's raise a glass to you and I
Let's show and tell that we survived
We're flying free like birds in the sky
Cause we're alive
One, two, three, we're alive (oh oh yeah!)
One, two, three, so alive (oh oh)
One, two, three, we're alive (oh oh yeah!)
One, two, three, so alive
Alive alive

Here we are, now it's in our hands
Oh yeah we feel it
Don't let it stop, we got to dance
B-best believe it hey!

We took it in baby from the start start
We chased the light and forgot the dark
So paint this moment with a million stars stars (c'mon!)
So everybody sing with me

Let me see your hands up high
Don't wait own it because tonight
We're flying free like birds in the sky
Cause we're alive (live)
Let's raise a glass to you and I

We're flying free like birds in the sky
Cause we're alive
One, two, three, we're alive (oh oh yeah!)
