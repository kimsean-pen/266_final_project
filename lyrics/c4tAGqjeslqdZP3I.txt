You and I made mistakes
We've been in and out of arguments
And said some things we didnt mean to say (wait)
This time you're not the one to blame
Sometimes I get a little too afraid
I didnt mean to cause you any pain

So wait (wait)
Ahh wait darlin
Before you go and throw our love away
Can I get a minute to explain
Now wait (wait)
Ah think about it
Before you turn around and walk away
Baby how can I get you to stay now, wait

Now I've been caught with my heart on
Time and time again
Holdin on, why
Boy you know I'm
So alone I
I just need a friend
And you've been so
Good to me
I don't wanna miss a real good thing

Wait
Ahh wait darlin
Before you go and throw our love away
Can I get a minute to explain
So wait
Ah think about it
Before you turn around and walk away
Baby how can I get you to stay now, wait

You dont know what you do to me
Baby won't you sit and talk to me
No it doesn't have to be this way
Darlin I'm just wantin you to stay
You don't know what you do to me
Baby won't you sit and talk to me
No it doesn't have to be this way
Darlin I'm just wantin you to stay (stay)

So wait
Think about it everyday
Before you turn around and walk away
Baby how can I get you to stay now, wait
Now wait
