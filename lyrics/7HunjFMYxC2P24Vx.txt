All my thoughts are useless
They keep me from seeing the bright light
Falling down this well now
I'm reaching but it's too high

Is this the end, the fall of man?
Did we take nothing from the meaning of change for the masses?
We're never gonna learn if all we do is take, take, no return
Blame it on the outside, close the curtains

Dare me to explain why we don't deserve
The land that we fill and the blood that they spilt
Not a selfish intention; an order to kill
Kill, kill, kill, ourselves with the question, destroy or rebuild?
Singing S, O, S, to ourselves

All my thoughts are useless
They keep me from seeing the bright light
Falling down this well now
I'm reaching but it's too high

It'll take a hurricane, to clean up all the mess we made
If we're gonna fly this flag of peace, we'll need you
We need to dig this up from the roots
And if a God's looking down we'll give them something to lose
We'll give them something to lose

Assailants; second nature hypocrites
Tell me that it's not as bad as it may seem
Surviving this death trap by the skin of our teeth
Oxygen thieves, are we just oxygen thieves?

This is survival of the sickest
We're the casualties that keep living
The same shit over and over again
The end is coming
The end is coming

It'll take a hurricane, to clean up all the mess we made
If we're gonna fly this flag of peace, we'll need you

It'll take a hurricane, to clean up all the mess we made
If we're gonna fly this flag of peace, we'll need you
We need to dig this up from the roots
And if a God's looking down we'll give them something to lose

All my thoughts are useless
They keep me from seeing the bright light
Falling down this well now
I'm reaching but it's too high
