Once I dreamt in light,
I dreamt of you.
It's inherent in me
and it's calls me back to you.
Cut your teeth on conviction,
just a kiss on the cheek
it's a feeling I loathe,
but whats a boy to believe in.
You can have whatever you want,
you can have whatever you want of me.
You can have whatever you want,
you can have whatever you want of me.
I was sprung from the fields
lying weaker in the wake,
if it's more that you want,
that it's more that you'll take,
so it keeps you from sleeping
and it keeps me wide awake
twisting inwards and out
how's a boy to behave
if at all
you can have whatever you want,
you can have whatever you want of me.
You can have whatever you want,
you can have whatever you want of me.

I don't believe it at all,
I don't believe you're the kind.
It's everything that you are,
deserving all that was mine,
it's whatever you want,
it's whatever you seek,
it's everything that you are,
it's everything you believe.

You can have whatever you want,
you can have whatever you want of me
You can have whatever you want,
you can have whatever you want of me.
You can have whatever you want,
you can have whatever you want of me.
You can have whatever you want,
you can have whatever you want of me.
