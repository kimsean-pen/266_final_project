I say mothers ain't too cool like mother sky,
I say mothers ain't too cool like mother sky,
I say mothers ain't too cool like mother sky,
I say mothers ain't too cool like mother sky.

I say mothers ain't too cool like mother sky,
I say mothers ain't too cool like mother sky,
Tell me for surprise if you're right,
Tell me for surprise if you're right.

I say mothers ain't too cool like mother sky,
Tell me for surprise if you're right
And tell me for surprise of your life,
And tell me for surprise of your life.

Life and mother sky
And mother sky
And mother sky
And mother sky.

I say mothers ain't too cool like mother sky,
Tell me for surprise if you're right,
I say mothers ain't too cool like mother sky,
I say mothers ain't too cool like mother sky.

Talking to this end,
Talking to this end,
Talking to this end.
