You're my star, guiding me
I know love

Whispers of a life, in one breath you'd be
Everything I am, you saved me

You're the light, in my darkest hour
I'll be fine, with you I can move on
This is our eternity

There are no words, to say how proud I am
You're my miracle, my angel

You're the light, in my darkest hour
I'll be fine, with you I can move on
This is our eternity

I would walk through flames for you, to light a way

I light a path for you, and carry you through life
You're my miracle, my angel

You're the light, in my darkest hour
I'll be fine, with you I can move on
This is our eternity
