A glimpse of its structure
It's ever altering axis
Another venturer (of the mind)
Entangled forever

Life space embraces earth
Death embrace your life
Preparing a transition
Beyond the limits of (human) comprehension

Quaking dimensions
Demented mensch
Open your eyes!
To a higher order of conspiracy

A formula to enhance
Your true inner ugliness
Operational instructions
For your interface to God

In somewhat greater perspective of time
You are practically non-existent
So reach through the angry crimson of this dawn
To my eternal star field domain
To my eternal star field domain
