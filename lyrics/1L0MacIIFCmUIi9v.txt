Take a minute to tell you right
And you can say what you want
Turn around every night
Somehow you're always going off

Doesn't matter what I've done
Or if I even crossed the line
Is that the holler going for blood
Girl, it doesn't have to be a fight

Throwing out the blame when you
Know it ain't my fault
Messing with my brain when you
Want to see me fall
There may come a time when
I don't bother you at all
It isn't my call, it isn't my call

Hey, why you keep screaming
At the top of your head?
I said hey, why you keep screaming
At the top of your head?
I said hey, why you keep screaming
At the top of your head?
I said hey, why you keep screaming
At the top of your head?

(There's no need to scream, baby
I'm standing right in front of your face
Why?
I know sometimes we don't get along
So Chris sing the second verse to you
Like this)

Take a minute to tell you now
And I don't have to raise my tone
Take the level and bring it down
I just want you to know

I got no trouble with what you said
I don't even think you're wrong
It's how you say it, you lose your head
Girl I'm standing right in front of you

Throwing out the blame when you know
It ain't my fault (ain't my fault)
Messing with my brain when you
Want to see me fall (see me fall)
There may come a time when
I don't bother you at all
It isn't my call, it isn't my call

Hey, why you keep screaming
At the top of your head?
I said hey, why you keep screaming
At the top of your head?
I said hey, why you keep screaming
At the top of your head?
I said hey, why you keep screaming
At the top of your head?

Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden
Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden
(I hear you, I hear you)

Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden
Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden
(I hear you, I hear you)

Hey, why you keep screaming
At the top of your head? (At the top of your head?)
I said hey, why you keep screaming
At the top of your head? (At the top of your head?)
I said hey, why you keep screaming
At the top of your head? (At the top of your head?)
I said hey, why you keep screaming
At the top of your head? (At the top of your head?)
Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden
Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden
(I hear you, I hear you)
