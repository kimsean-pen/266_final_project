I woke all in white
Right in the middle of the knife
I hold the that I had left you with no reason why
And I know I wasn't kind
And you probably lost your mind
But, oh, I couldn't find one reason

I heard it from the aisle of the cathedral
Baby, I was gonna break your heart
Even in the something lethal
Know we had to stop before we started
And we torture each other and wonder why
We ever promised until we died
And I swore that I'd never leave you behind
But I've seen the light, oh, I've seen the light

You made me feel so safe
I recall it like it's yesterday
Arranged like a thought out maze
I try, couldn't find a way
I was screaming out
I was screaming out, now all I hear is the sound

I heard it from the aisle of the cathedral
Baby, I was gonna break your heart
Even in the something lethal
Know we had to stop before we started
And we torture each other and wonder why
We ever promised until we died
And I swore that I'd never leave you behind
But I've seen the light, oh, I've seen the light

I woke all in white

I heard it from the aisle of the cathedral
Baby, I was gonna break your heart
Even in the something lethal
Know we had to stop before we started
And we torture each other and wonder why
We ever promised until we died
And I swore that I'd never leave you behind
But I've seen the light, oh, I've seen the light
Said I've seen the light, oh, I've seen the light
