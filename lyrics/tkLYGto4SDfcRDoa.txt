We came here on his back
& we caught your eye
The salty ocean wind
Made the seagulls cry
The rocking of his house
Had me holding on
But I knew that I was safe
From there on out

The waves that hit his face
Marked the past
& the farrows on his skin
Oh, how time goes fast
& we are far

From home

but we're so happy
Far from home
All alone
But we're so happy
After every sunny day
Came a stormy night
That's when Finner would say
"Keep your heads held high"
& we are far
From home
But we're so happy
Far from home
All alone
But we're so happy
We are far
From home
But we're so happy
Far from home
All alone
But we're so happy
