Lay your head down with me, darling
Pick your heart up off the floor
If you need some, give me something
You know, I know

Hair down, so you hide, a drug for my eyes
I've been needing some, you've been needing some, so maybe a little too much
Slow down, in your time, No, you don't need to rush
I been drinking some, you've been drinking some, so maybe a little too much
'Cause all my days were like they were getting so lonely lately
I couldn't take it much longer baby, no baby, mmmh
So tell me lady, do you feel like I do, are you craving
Someone to hold you and as the sun comes up and sets the stars

Lay your head down with me, darling
Pick your heart up off the floor
If you need some, give me something
You know, yeah, I know
Lay your head down with me, darling
Pick your heart up off the floor
If you need some, give me something
You know, yeah, I know

Face found, Calvin Klein, her bank don't need love
I've been dreaming some, have you been dreaming some, so maybe a little too much
Flow down, to an Isle, the rum is dyed blue
We've been drinking some, you've been drinking some, so maybe a little too much
The things your saying, keeping me high, My Apothecary
Give me your stories to go, no baby, oh baby, mmmh
So, tell me babe, are you feeling the love that I'm feeling lately?
Nowhere I'd rather be, as the sun comes up and sets the stars

Lay your head down with me, darling
Pick your heart up off the floor
If you need some, give me something
You know, yeah, I know
Lay your head down with me, darling
Pick your heart up off the floor
If you need some, give me something
You know, yeah, I know

'Cause all my days seem like they were getting so lonely lately
I couldn't take it much longer baby, no baby, mmmh

Lay your head down with me, darling
Pick your heart up off the floor
If you need some, give me something
You know, yeah, I know
Lay your head down with me, darling
Pick your heart up off the floor
If you need some, give me something
You know, yeah, I know
