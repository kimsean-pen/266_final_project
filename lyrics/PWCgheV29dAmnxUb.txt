November, my whole world was cold and grey
Do you remember, how you turned the clock to May
From that day, you took my heart and pulled the strings
I'm suspended in time and space and wandering
In our dream world, shining light from all around
I never noticed our shadows on the ground
Outside the sun is shining
There's not a cloud in sight
Inside the season's changing
Your words are turning me to ice
From that day, you took my heart and pulled the strings
I'm suspended in time and space and wandering
In our dream world, shining light from all around
I never noticed our shadows on the ground
I want to love everybody
I want to hurt no one
Maybe it's just an illusion
The dark side of the sun
Outside the sun is shining
There's not a cloud in sight
Inside the season's changing
Your words are turning me to ice
I want to love everybody
I want to hurt no one
Maybe it's just an illusion
The dark side of the sun
Outside the sun is shining
There's not a cloud in sight
Inside the season's changing
Your words are turning me to ice
I want to love everybody
I want to hurt no one
Maybe it's just an illusion
The dark side of the sun
