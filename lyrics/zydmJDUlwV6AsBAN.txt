I could hold, your beautiful hands
And kiss, your beautiful eyelids
Throw open, your beautiful doors
And phone, your beautiful friends

But it's all over
It's all over
It's all over
It's all over

I could bind, your beautiful wrists
And shut, your beautiful eyes
With the drugs, with the drugs, with the drugs
And kick, your beautiful doors in
O shame, on your beautiful friends

Cos it's all over
It's all over
It's all over
It's all over

I could fight, your beautiful words
And mourn, your beautiful loss
Throw me out, of your beautiful lifestyle
And call, your beautiful name

It's all over
Cos it's all over
It's all over
It's all over
It's all over
It's all over
It's all over
It's all over
