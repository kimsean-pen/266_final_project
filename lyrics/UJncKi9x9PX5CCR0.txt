Melody lee, a broken man and a broken dream
It must have been a change of heart
Your life was cruel they called it art

Melody lee, you need a nuke to set you free
You know you can't cheat tomorrow
If you hide any sorrow

Melody lee, you gotta find your secret enemy
You're on the run with nowhere to go
If you die someone to know

Forget your heart, you need not stay
A second longer than today

Melody lee, a broken man and a broken dream
It must have been a change of heart
Your life was cruel they called it art
