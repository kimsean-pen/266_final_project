I can't concentrate
My brain's damaged over you
Im saying stupid things
I bet she doesn't know my name

But my head hurts
And without you it's worse

I want you to take shoot me deeply into your veins
I want you to come breathe me deeply into your lungs

But my head hurts
And without you it's worse
Suffocating on my own
You're killing me
I hope you know

I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist

But my head hurts
And without you it's worse
Suffocating on my own
You're killing me

I hope you know
I hope you know
I hope you know
I hope you know
I hope you know
I hope you know
I hope you know
I hope you know
