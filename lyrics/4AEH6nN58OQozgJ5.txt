You're the one that I adore you
Everyone they don't know me
Tell me things you are to me, I do

All the things I wanna sayin'
Tell me things you are to me
All the love you have to say, I do

Yesterday is when I felt down
And you came and put the things on the ground
And you helped to save ... they looked at me
All they say, I do
That's why I want to be

Free, free like the wind blow
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feeling of letting my hair blow
Just take my time wherever I go
I 'm in my

You're the one that I adore, just
Kiss me once, I wanna know you
Feel the word, I could give in mind

If you are the one for me, just
Tell me twice and I will see the
The heart and soul of all the things I feel

Yesterday when I felt down, I start
Try to make sense of I was around, you know
Life is just a thing you don't pass the way I do
Because I want to be

Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
To feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be

Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
To feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I'm in my (day, alright)

Yesterday was when I felt down, I start
Try to make sense of i wanna ..., you start
Try to make a way to see this thing, I do
You, Ah, You, 'Cause I want to be

Free, free like the wind blow
To fly away just like a sparrow
To feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be

Free, free like the wind blow (Free like the wind blow)
To fly away just like a sparrow (Wherever i go)
To feel of letting my hair blow (I take my time baby)
To take my time wherever I go (Take my time wherever I go)
I want to be

Free, free like the wind blow (Free, Free like the wind blow)
To fly away just like a sparrow (Oh my mind)
To feel of letting my hair blow (Woah Woah Woah Woah baby)
To take my time wherever I go (wherever I go)

Free, free like the wind blow (you'll be free) (I want to be free)
To fly away just like a sparrow (I gotta be free, babe)
To feel letting my hair blow (I want to make free) (Ah Ah Uh Oh baby)
To take my time wherever I go (wherever I go)

Gotta be free
