There's a little black dark scar tired divide
This is it, can you hear me?
Have you ever felt a sad heart buried alive?
You can do almost anything
There's a little red bridge with the view of the sun
With a lake, recommend such a setting sight
And the thousands of stars, come out thousands of times
We can go, only if you believe
Only if you believe

Do you feel like you've lost everything you can lose?
This is it, can you hear me?
When you cry do your tears ever chill up the room?
Calling out in a moment of need
Do you ever lay awake with the look in the eye?
Asking God if a wish is too big to deny?
I will offer a line, and it's ready for use

Let me know, are you ready for me?

I'd like to say
That you're my only fear
And when I dream
It slowly disappears
And when I wake
I'm right here by your side

To feel your heart
Beat in and out of time

(Hey)
When the storm brings rain, snow, fate of all kinds
You can feel almost anything
When the day seems to melt, fall flat into night
You can feel almost anything

When you can't go on, you gotta get up and try
This is it, can you feel me?
When the bombs come down, we will make it alive

But only If you want to believe
I'd like to say
That you're my only fear
And when I dream

It slowly disappears
And when I wake
I'm right here by your side
To feel your heart

Beat in and out of time
I'd like to say
That you're my only fear (You're my only)

And when I dream
It slowly disappears
And when I wake
I'm right here by your side (You're my only)
To feel your heart

Beat in and out of time
Out of time (You're my only)
When I dream
(You're my only)
When I dream
I feel your heart
When I dream
I'm out of time

(I feel your heart)
When I dream
I'm out of time
I feel your heart
I feel your heart
I feel your heart

I feel your heart
I'd like to say
That you're my only fear (You're my only)
And when I dream
It slowly disappears
And when I wake
I'm right here by your side (You're my only)
To feel your heart
Beat in and out of time.
