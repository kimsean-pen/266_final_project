No relief
From this blue melody
The right words
Escape me

Love you go down
Love is a race now

Know your face
From this blue memory
Open doors
Close on me

Love you go down
Love no trace now

Put your smile on my face
Stop me wasting away
Make a promise you break
Green light all the way
To a grey day

Love you go down
Love is a race now

Each new voice
And good times
Let me be
Change your tune
Sounds the same

Put your smile on my face
Stop me wasting away
Make a promise you break
Stop me wasting away

Put your smile on my face
Stop me wasting away
make a promise you break
Green light all the way
To a grey day
