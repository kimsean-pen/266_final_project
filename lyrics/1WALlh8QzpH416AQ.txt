My grills are sunny, drip icey cold
Gold offshore bank accounts and diamond blue palm trees
My platinum troubles
I'll drown them in pink champagne
Escape into the sky in my own private jet
That's what I dream of in my heart

Gold coins everywhere,
Dollars up in the air
It's a billion love affair
Gold coins out the window
Money falls like the rain falls
And I'mma spend it like I don't care

Richness and Bentley's that's how I roll
These rock stars buy me postcards out with ruby's rare
Our stack is so high
Building green castle walls
I'll hide inside my fortress
Milkin' in my bed
That's what I dream of in my heart

Gold coins everywhere,
Dollars up in the air
It's a billion love affair
Gold coins out the window
Money falls like the rain falls
And I'mma spend it like I don't care

Gold coins everywhere,
Dollars up in the air
It's a billion love affair!
Gold coins everywhere,
Dollars up in the air
It's a billion love affair
Gold coins out the window,
Money falls like the rain falls
And I'mma spend it like I don't care
