I would die before I divorce ya
I'd take a thousand thumps
For my love
'Cause ya
Kiss a lucky horseshoe
Stuck it in my boxing glove
'Cause anyone
Who will see us
Through our victory
And dumb defeat

Knows that I'll take you to the cleaners
If you come between the cheats

Between the cheats
Woah-ah-ohhh (Wooh-hoo)
Ohhh-ohhh (Wooh-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Between the cheats
Woah-ah-ohhh (Wooh-hoo)
Ohhh-Ohhh (Ooh-wee)

My husband is

The fine handsome hustler
And he still make
This housewife blush
So I'm lockin'
My hand in his
I'm sitting on
The royal flush
Women drink him in
Swimming in his green eyes
Then go home
And cash the chips you got
And take your bad beat to-o
Oh, to a bottle
The jack of hearts is my jackpot

Between the cheats
Woah-ah-ohhh (Wooh-hoo)
Ohhh-ohhh (Wooh-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Between the cheats
Woah-ah-ohhh (Wooh-hoo)
Ohhh-Ohhh (Ooh-wee-oooh)

'Cause we all have to lock eyes
And I know as my heart beats
There's a winning secret to both
And it's sworn
Between the cheats...

Between the cheats
Woah-ah-ohhh (Wooh-hoo)
Ohhh-ohhh (Wooh-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Between the cheats
Woah-ah-ohhh (Wooh-hoo)
Ohhh-Ohhh (Ooh-wee-oooh)
Between the cheats
Woah-ah-ohhh (Wooh-hoo)
Ohhh-ohhh (Wooh-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Between the cheats
Woah-ah-ohhh (Wooh-hoo)
Ohhh-Ohhh (Ooh-wee-oooh)
