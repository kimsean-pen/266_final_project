I was lost but now I am found.
A line was crossed, a vessel run aground.
The boy has gone, let's grieve and let him go.
He left a dog, but it's a new day don't you know?

In the company of wolves I sat in silence
observant and afraid

He was there with the eyes like glowing embers
the man knew she was made.

I was lost but now I am high.
It helps to know serenity from anywhy.
Something's wrong, something's wrong,
when it all remains the same.
So face the fire, come into your name.

In the company of wolves I sat in silence, observant and afraid.
He was there with the eyes like glowing embers,
the man knew she was made. Ohhhhhooo

Even I can't recall how many days I have been out there
For when all those lights cease to shine,
it was a lie I think for the first time.
Infinity it falls, in feathery folds but she bites like loveless eyes,
but with her belly full she called this rite of passage,
it was the longest night of my life.
(it was, it was, it was, it was the longest night of my life
it was, it was, it was...)
