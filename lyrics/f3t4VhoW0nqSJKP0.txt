I've locked myself in silence
And kept denying
That you're already gone
Isolated in the darkness for too long
I'm still holding you before
You fade into oblivion

I can't save you
In the end we fall apart
Forgive me now
No matter how
Hard I try, you'll carry on
Please be waiting
We'll meet again beyond the stars
I'm not afraid
To embrace the end
Time has come to let you go
To oblivion

I'm tired to fight this sadness on my own
I have waited way too long
To stand up and move on
Your decaying echo haunts me all the time
I'm afraid to say the last goodbyes
'Cause you will be forever gone to oblivion

I can't save you
In the end we fall apart
Forgive me now
No matter how
Hard I try, you'll carry on
Please be waiting
We'll meet again beyond the stars
I'm not afraid
To embrace the end
Time has come to let you go

And leave our world behind
I still believe
You're within me
In memories
You'll be shining like a star
And lightning up the skies
I still believe
You're within me
In memories
'Cause you were my only one

I can't save you
In the end we fall apart
Forgive me now
No matter how
Hard I try, you'll carry on
Please be waiting
We'll meet again beyond the stars
I'm not afraid
To face the end
Time has come to let you go

Now it's time to let you go
To oblivion

Now it's time to let you go
To oblivion
