Man: The battle of France is over.
Duff: Congragulations. You've joined the rinks of all the rest.
Was it her face that invaded your mind?

The kind isn't that hard to find
She lets you think that you found her first
That's how she works, her sick and twisted gypsy curse
She can swallow knives, she can swallow lives

Golden black stare, but the night of your demise

Try to run away with the gypsy woman
Here today then gone for good
Can't get away with the gypsy woman
Thought no one would know
Your secrets down below
Can't go, can't go with her

Can't go, can't go with her
Can't go, can't go with her
The gypsy woman
This is her favorite game to play

She's got you stumbling, stum-stu-stumbling
Talks with a grin 'cause she's got no shame
Enjoy the fame, bringing down the family name
She can swallow knives, she can swallow lives

Golden black stare, but the night of your demise

Try to run away with the gypsy woman
Here today then gone for good
Can't get away with the gypsy woman
Thought no one would know
Your secrets down below
Can't go, can't go with her

Can't go, can't go with her
Can't go, can't go with her
The gypsy woman
She can rob you blind with just one look from those eyes

Out of all the thieves that trained her, none of them could tame her

Try to run away with the gypsy woman
Here today then gone for good
Can't get away with the gypsy woman
Thought no one would know
Your secrets down below
Can't go, can't go with her
Can't go, can't go with her
Can't go, can't go with her
The gypsy woman
Can't go, can't go with her
Can't go, can't go with her
Can't go, can't go with her
The gypsy woman
