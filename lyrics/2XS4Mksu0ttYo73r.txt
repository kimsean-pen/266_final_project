Hey, hey
Mmmm
Hey yeah
Mmmm
Ay, huh?

Body little trippy
Feel a little tipsy
Like what's going on (what?)
I, I'm a little dizzy
But fuck the shit I like it
You buy the brew I'll ride it
That yuengling make you do ya thang
(That yuengling make you do the thang)
You know a nigga want it

That yuengling make you do ya thang
All white docs and a pinky ring
Pop it so good make you wanna sing
All night long like a mary jane

12 o'clock in the morning
I guess I'll say it again

That yuengling make you do ya thang
All white docs and a pinky ring
Pop it so good make you wanna sing
All night long like a mary jane

12 o'clock in the morning

Flexing
I swear these niggas straight flexing
Don't have to tell the world that you're on
That's why we at it like rabbit
In the car or your closet
You turn me on your carpet
I'm cascading, my back aching, my personal aerobics
You love so damn long
You love me like we on
That backstroke got a nigga stoked
That downtown so strong

That yuengling make you do ya thang
All white docs and a pinky ring
Pop it so good make you wanna sing
All night long like a mary jane

12 o' clock in the morning
I don't think these niggas heard me

That yuengling make you do ya thang
All white docs and a pinky ring
Pop it so good make you wanna sing
All night long like a mary jane
