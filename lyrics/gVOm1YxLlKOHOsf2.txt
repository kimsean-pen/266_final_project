All I remember is the smile on your face
Then you turned your back on the world
Was that the last thing you could do

How does it feel now to stand alone
Do you feel the weight on your shoulders
You wear that crown of arrogance with pride
We all want to see you kneel before your demons
Like we all used to do

The smoke is fading out
And we can finally see what we have done
Ruined our home again

Take a bath in the last beam of sunset
Purify your stained soul
Let's see how high you can go this time
We are still down here
Waiting for a miracle
But you've got to believe
We're out of hope

The smoke is fading out
And we can finally see what we have done

You think you look like god
What is wrong with you
Battered by religion
But still you're trying to smile
Under the shadow of the cross
Burning from inside out
Being baptized doesn't give you any relief

Found yourself being fooled by yourself
And now you are dying in shame

The smoke is fading out
And we can finally see what we have done
Ruined our home again

No glory, no remorse, no mercy
We burn your heaven down with unholy fire
Once we were blinded by the words from above
But now we can see clearly

Ruined our home again
