This is my sorry, I've been all over the place
I know that you haven't had much time to yourself and
I know you're busy
But when you wake up, could you please call me?
I haven't slept in for a while
As soon as I wake my mind starts running
Back to the old place and the next tour
Move from Mission down to Bay Shore

Time keeps dragging like a big slug
I get squished like a big bug
Time to pull my weight
Trying hard not to lose control
Tell me what you wanna see
Tell me cause I gotta go

This is my sorry, it's been a long year
And I've been trying to take it easy
It never slows down, it just keeps going
I gotta get back, I gotta listen
I wish you'd take care of yourself first
Before you worry about the others
And when it feels like it's piling over
Will you remember you got my number

Time keeps dragging like a big slug
I get squished like a big bug
Time to pull my weight
Trying hard not to lose control
Tell me what you wanna see
Tell me cause I wanna know
Tell me cause I gotta go

Here's my sorry it's been a long year
Come to think of there's been so many
So there's no reason so for old excuses
You know the right way, get up and do it
You're not alone here or were you ever
Move down to LA, enjoy the weather
You gotta lot more left to offer
Stop flickering out
It's time to pull my weight

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

Time ain't moving on without you
Don't make me wait so long, I'll pause
Time ain't moving on without you
Don't make me wait so long, I'll pause
