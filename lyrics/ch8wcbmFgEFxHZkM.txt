It's really hard
I can't cry in your arms
'Cause you're not here
It's not your fault
And if it was I wouldn't care

My heart is bigger than the distance
In between us
I know it 'cause I feel it beating

So strong it'll knock you down

So strong, so strong
Over here

I can count the miles away
From where I wanna be
I bet your skin is warm
And that you're smiling
Yeah, that's what I always loved

The most about you
So strong come and knock me down
Hey!
Baby if I'm half the man I say I am

If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am
Then I'll believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you

I'll get in my car

Driving faster than I ever did before
Head out west until I finally reach the shore
And then I'll swim back to wherever you are
And we'll ride the under current down to the floor
Making friends with all the unfamiliar creatures

Pushing back on the unnecessary pressure
Come up for air just so you know we won't drown
We're so strong, the world can't keep us out
Hey!

Baby if I'm half the man I say I am
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am
Then I'll believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you
Yeah, ooh yeah

Yeah, ooh yeah

So do you love me (Yeah)
All you gotta do is say yes
Now do you love me (Yeah)
And I won't ever second guess
Now do you love me (Yeah)

All you gotta do is say yes
Now do you love me (Yeah)
Then you've already proved it
Yeah, yeah
Baby if I'm half the man I say I am
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am
Then I'll believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is
Baby if I'm half the man I say I am
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am
Then I'll believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you
