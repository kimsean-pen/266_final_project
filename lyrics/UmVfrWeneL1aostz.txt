Ooh, you're searching for something I know, wont make you happy
Ooh, you're thirsting for something I know, wont make you happy
Ooh, you did it all again, you broke another skin
It's hard to believe this time, hard to believe
That my heart, my hearts an open door... See More
You got all you came for, baby
So weary, someone to love is bigger than your prides worth
Is bigger than the pain you got for it hurts
And out runs all of the sadness
It's terrifying, life, through the darkness
And I'd do it all again, I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again, I'd do it all again
You try sometimes but it wont stop
You got my heart and my heads lost, ooh yeah
I've been burning down these candles for love, for love
So weary, someone to love is bigger than your pride
Ooh, someone to love, mm, someone to love
Someone to love
Ooh, you're searching for something I know, wont make you happy
Ooh
