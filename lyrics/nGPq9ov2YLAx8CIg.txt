I met you in a dream last night
When the moon was high above
I tumbled over highest highs
And than I woke and you were gone

I saw you on TV last night
I heard you on the radio
Now baby I have lost my mind
And I can never let you go

I should have kept loving you
And try to keep you in my life

Whenever I'm dreaming
Wherever I'm hiding
Whenever I'm seeing
Whenever I'm drowning far for you
Wherever I go, Whatever I do
I just keep coming back to you
Whenever I'm dreaming
Whenever I'm drowning baby

Hey do you still recall those nights?
Our burning love in raging war
And after each and every fight
You'd still be coming back for more

Instead of just hurting you
I should have given you my life

Whenever I'm dreaming
Wherever I'm hiding
Whenever I'm seeing
Whenever I'm drowning far from you
Wherever I go, Whatever I do
I just keep coming back to you
My mind is made up, I've had enough
And I won't be coming back to you
Whenever I'm dreaming
Whenever I'm drowning far from you
