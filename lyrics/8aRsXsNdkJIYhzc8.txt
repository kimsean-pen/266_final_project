Like love on the run there will be tomorrows
The stars and the sun every beam I'll follow
Together we're dancing all night long
Together we're dancing on and on

The sound of the drum keeps my soul depending
Each day and each night and it's never ending
Together we're dancing all night long
Together we're dancing on and on

Like love on the run there will be tomorrows
The stars and the sun every beam I'll follow
Together we're dancing all night long
Together we're dancing on and on

The sound of the drum keeps my soul depending
Each day and each night and its never ending
Together we're dancing all night long
Together we're dancing on and on and on

The sun
'Cause I believe now and then
If you could look into the sun again
Cause I believe now and then

On the run
On the run
On the run

On the run
On the run
On the run

Like love on the run there will be tomorrows
The stars and the sun every beam I'll follow
Together we're dancing all night long
Together we're dancing on and on

The sound of the drum keeps my soul depending
Each day and each night and its never ending
Together we're dancing all night long
Together we're dancing on and on

Like love on the run there will be tomorrows
The stars and the sun every beam I'll follow
Together we're dancing all night long
Together we're dancing on and on and on
