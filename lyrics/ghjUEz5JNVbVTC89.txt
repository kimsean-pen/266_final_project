I can't forget you
My little Mushanga
I keep a place in my heart for you
The days of waitin'
They keep gettin' longer
And not a thing I can do
I was a poet, a magazine writer
Sent to report on political views
It was by chance
Through a lens that I met you
Capetown girl with no shoes

You were runnin' down the road
I was goin' your way
I stopped and turned around
And lent you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering
I didn't understand
(You broke into my heart)
I saw your eyes and then I knew
(You broke into my heart)
Like the wind and rain that followed you
(You broke into my heart)
Had the Lord above forgotten you?
You broke in from the start
And all my tears belong to you
(Mushanga, ohh ohh ohh)
(Mushanga, ohh ohh ohh)

I sat and watched
As she danced by the fires
Through ancient songs
Did the tale unfold
They sang of diamonds
That came from their mountains
And loss of lives
Mining white man's gold
I had to leave
And go back to Manhattan
Where all my stories
Are bought and sold
I know the city
Would surely be saddened
If what I knew could be told

You were runnin' down the road
I was goin' your way
I stopped and turned around
And lent you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering
I didn't understand
(You broke into my heart)
I saw your eyes and then I knew
(You broke into my heart)
Like the wind and rain that followed you
(You broke into my heart)
Had the Lord above forgotten you?
You broke in from the start
And all my tears belong to you
(Mushanga, ohh ohh ohh)
(Mushanga, ohh ohh ohh)

Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

It's been so long
Since I last heard your laughter
So many letters
And still no news
I hope you find all the things
That you're after
You know my heart is with you

You were runnin' down the road
I was goin' your way
I stopped and turned around
And lent you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering
I didn't understand
(You broke into my heart)
I saw your eyes and then I knew
(You broke into my heart)
Like the wind and rain that followed you
(You broke into my heart)
Had the Lord above forgotten you?
(You broke into my heart)
I saw your eyes and then I knew
(Ohh, ohh ohh ohh, ohh)
(Ohh ohh ohh ohh)
(Ohh, ohh ohh ohh, ohh)
You broke in from the start
And all my tears belong to you
(Mushanga, ohh ohh ohh)
(Mushanga, ohh ohh ohh)

Mushanga, ohh ohh ohh
Mushanga, ohh ohh ohh
(Ohh ohh ohh)
Mushanga, ohh ohh ohh
Mushanga, ohh ohh ohh
Mushanga, ohh ohh ohh
Mushanga, ohh ohh ohh
(Ohh ohh ohh)
