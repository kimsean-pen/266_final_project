Now I've gotta go court the conductor
And I gotta bleed gold on the track
Breathin' in a chokehold

Now I've gotta go court the conductor
And I gotta bleed gold on the track
Breathin' in a chokehold

Hallelujah, on your lips (on your lips)
Hallelujah, through your hips (through your hips)
Hallelujah, record skip (record skip)
Hallelujah, throw a fit (throw a fit)
Throw a fit

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

For you I'd jump in front of a train
I'd lay in front of a bus
For you I'd jump in front of a train
Forever my companion
For you I'd jump in front of a train
I'd lay in front of a bus
For you I'd jump in front of a train
Forever my companion

Stop that train (on the double)
Stop that train (let me off)
Stop that train (conductor)

Stop that train (on the double)
Stop that train (lickety-split)
Stop that train (conductor)
