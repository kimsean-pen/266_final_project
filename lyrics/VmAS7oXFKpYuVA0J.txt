Dear Johns and alcohol
Cheap shots you knock me out so cold
It's not worth it no, you're not worth it

I'm so ashamed
That I shower you with gifts
But I don't get back what I give
My two cents ain't worth the change
Your selfish got me feeling some type of way

So correct me if I'm wrong
Your life is a sad song
Ravel couldn't compose the mess God made on you
Animalistic, material instinct
Driving Jody's Ferrari
Tag chaser en route

My heart strings are tangled in you
You treat me like I'm your little marionette
Your type is a common breed
You're all so small but you think that you're as good as it gets

Dear Johns and alcohol
Cheap shots you knock me out so cold
It's not worth it no, you're not worth it
You only call when I wanna pay
Maxed out plastic, guess you'll be on your way
It's not worth it no, you're not worth it
It's not worth it, I ain't got time for that
Ain't nobody got time for that

I'm out here and bombs are flying
Still you drop bombs on me like this baby
I been crazy but you got me tripping with a rhythm
Like where have you been lately

You're wasting my time, and I don't have much to fill it
In the desert heat on my grind while you're wasting my skrilla
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind, I'm paying your bills
While you're gold digging civilians just for the kill

Dear Johns and alcohol
Cheap shots you knock me out so cold
It's not worth it no, you're not worth it
You only call when I wanna pay
Maxed out plastic, guess you'll be on your way
It's not worth it no, you're not worth it
It's not worth it, I ain't got time for that
Ain't nobody got time for that
