You never had a lot to say to me,
it's not a big surprise for all to see.
You know I'd give it all to go out with you,
whatever it takes.

Give it up, or refuse.
If you want me to choose.
You know it feels quite frustrating.
Live it up for a week,
you never wanted to sleep;
it's just not worth contemplating.

I'll always give it to you honest,
I'll always try to solve your every problem.
I'll always give it to you honest,
when it hurts and it's bleak, yeah it's true,
I never want to leave-

You can trust me, you could stay.
You can tell me, I won't let you down.
Let's pretend, we could date.
We could go out, just (the) two of us.

I'll catch you if you're falling,
if nothing ever makes you hit the ground.
I'll be your one and only,
every time you need someone downtown.
I'll catch you if you're falling,
we could hoist a flag to the stars.
I'll be there when you call me,
heart to heart and hopeless without doubt.

So keep me by your side,
you know you always leave me right behind.
I hope that you will always be the same,
whatever it takes.

Give it up, or refuse.
If you want me to choose.
You know it feels quite frustrating.
Live it up for a week,
you never wanted to sleep;
it's just not worth contemplating.

I'll always give it to you honest,
I'll always try to solve your every problem.
I'll always give it to you honest,
when it hurts and it's bleak, yeah it's true,
I never want to leave-

You can trust me, you could stay.
