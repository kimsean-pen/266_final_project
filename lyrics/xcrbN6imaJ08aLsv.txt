I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
time don't matter to me
'cause i'm a thousand miles from nowhere
and there's no place i want to be
I got heartaches in my pocket
i got echoes in my head
and all that i keep hearing
are the cruel cruel things that you said
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
time don't matter to me
'cause i'm a thousand miles from nowhere
and there's no place i want to be
oh, i
oh, i
oh, i
oh, i
oh, i
oh, i
oh, i
oh, i
I got bruises on my memory
i got tear stains on my hands
and in the mirror there's a vision
of what used to be a man
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
time don't matter to me
'cause i'm a thousand miles from nowhere
and there's no place i want to be
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
time don't matter to me
'cause i'm a thousand miles from nowhere
and there's no place i want to be
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
time don't matter to me
'cause i'm a thousand miles from nowhere
