I stand alone
Waiting for my thoughts
Alone among
Shattered visions, waiting
Eternally, watching:

Depressed they attempt mockery
Failure. Ceasing of heartbeats
End of pointless days
Thoughts infiltrate the voids
Of oblivion

Hollow joy, artificial happiness
Broadcasted daily, and pitifully
Raising futile fists

Darkness marauds
The excruciating populations
Perplexingly shallow
Appears abstract through eyes

Familiar to none else
Satan reaches deep within
My brain is shrouded in lava
Piercing and burning
Searing my past
