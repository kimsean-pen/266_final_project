You and me between sheets
It just doesn't get better than this
The many windswept yellow Stickies of my mind
Or the molten, emotional front line
I couldn't care less I'm transfixed in this absolute bliss

Hmmmmmm

Sweet sleepless tumbling night
Mmm and the morning on your skin, a loved up light
Tracing patterns in the maze of your back
Softly, softly the goose bumps, like that

And then a kiss

Mmmm, maybe another

And another one mmm
