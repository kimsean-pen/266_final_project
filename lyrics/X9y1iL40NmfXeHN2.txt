If you're dreaming, son don't you rise,
I never get lost, so deep into eyes
I won't give up until you give in,
But I know you must realize
I could be good for you,
You could be good for me too yeaheah
I could be good for you,
You could be good for me too
Everyone knows, but they don't know why,
How much will a smile, you satisfy
Stars gonna shine, the way that you feel,
So there is no reason to wonder why
I could be good for you,
You could be good for me too yeaheah
I could be good for you,
You could be good for me too

(Hey)
I could be good for you,
You could be good for me too yeaheah
I could be good for you,
You could be good for me too
I could be good for you,
You could be good for me too yeaheah
I could be good for you,
You could be good for me too yeaheah
(You could be good)
(You could be good)
