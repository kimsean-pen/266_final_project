I want to crawl back inside my mother's womb
I want to shut out all the lights in this room
I want to start fresh, like a baby in a sink
Scrub away all these thoughts that I think of you

So life moves slowly when you're waiting for it to boil
Feel like I watch from six feet under the soil
Still want to hold you and kiss behind your ears
But I recount the countless tears that I lost for you

Before you finally go, before you go
There's one thing you should know
That I promise

Starting now, I'll never know your name
Starting now, I'll never feel the same
Starting now, I wish you never came into my world

I want to crawl back inside my bed of sin
I want to burn the sheets that smell like your skin
Instead I'll wash them just like kitchen rags with stains
Spinning away any piece that remains of you

Before you finally go, before you go
Oh, there's one thing you should know
That I promise

Starting now, I'll never know your name
Starting now, I'll never feel the same
Starting now, I wish you never came into my world

It's my world, it's not ours anymore
It's my world, it's my world
It's not ours anymore, anymore

Starting now, never know your name
Starting now, never feel the same
Starting now, starting now
(It's my world, it's my world, it's my world)

Starting now, starting now
(It's my world, it's my world, it's my world)
Starting now, starting now
(It's my world)

Wish you never came into my world
Starting now, starting now, into my world
Starting now, starting now, into my world
Starting now
