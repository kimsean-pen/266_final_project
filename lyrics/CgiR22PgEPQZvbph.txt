All we have
It's a little scare
We don't mind
And we don't care

Remember,
I thought you died
I hold you now
Won't let you cry

Love will bring us back x 4

Back a new day x 4

Seven years
we're still together and
The time has left
A little scare

But I want you to know
That you can stand by me and
The gift you gave to me
Has changed my life

Love will bring us back x 4

Back a new day x 4
