Conquer your world
Study you quietly
Count the ways
I'll do anything you say
There will be no holding back
Legions of me

So cruel
Longing eternally
Bitter sweet possibilities
A tiger on the attack
Ready to bleed

Tragically yours
Obey and submit to me
I will find you
Wherever you hide
Got a thrill for the hunt
A skilled criminal mind

So calm
Tracking your every move
Unrelenting my conscious clear
Beyond a shadow of doubt
A force to be feared

Wretched and pure
Tricky and dangerous
Do not question
Or challenge your fate
A promise written in blood
Take life for pay

Yours is not to ask why
Yours is to do and die
Professional killer
