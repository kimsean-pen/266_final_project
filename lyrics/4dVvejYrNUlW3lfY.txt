Hey lion
You're not...
Hey lion
You're not...
Hey lion
You're not my king
And I don't want your worship
I'm already tall
Hey lion
You keep your gifts
I've got many of them
And I'm already full
Hey lion
Please save your breath
You've already spoken
And I've heard it before
Hey lion
Here comes our death
It's time to silence you sermon
And to go back to war
Hey lion
You're not...
Hey lion
You're not...
Hey lion
You're not my king
And I don't want your worship
I'm already tall
Hey lion
You keep your gifts
I've got many of them
And I'm already full
Hey lion
Please save your breath
You've already spoken
And I've heard it before
Hey lion
Here comes our death
It's time to silence you sermon
And to go back to war
Hey lion
You're not...
Lion king...
Hey lion
You're not
Lion king...
