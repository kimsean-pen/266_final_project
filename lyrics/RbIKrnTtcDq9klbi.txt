You're so full of confidence
I wish i were you
A hand on my chest
I'd sing and sing and you'd cover the rest
Make me believe
Show me the way
Make me believe
My existence and the fire in me
Can dance indefinitely
I've been dying to know your name

I lost a bit of fire
I lost a bit of me
I lost a bit of everything
But not everything seems to be missing me

To all the unhappy wanderers
After the desert there is a sea

Of dust and bones
And the bits of shallow water left
Hide in their wombs
Fossil inspirations

The sea runs dry
We lose hope
