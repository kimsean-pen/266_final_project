I know I have earned it
But most days I don't feel like I deserve this
To the victim go the spoils
Through this Mortal Coil
Oh how the years have been so kind to me

I found the permanent place
Where the skies are gold not grey
I can taste the salt on your skin
And feel the sunshine on my face
We're gonna run
We're gonna run
Gonna runaway from the day
We're gonna run
Gonna run
Gonna runaway from the day

Finally free from the past
How long could a feeling like this last?
The road away from here
Is long and steep my dear
Oh how the years have been so kind to me

I found the permanent place
Where the skies are gold not grey
I can taste the salt on your skin
And feel the sunshine on my face
We're gonna run
We're gonna run
Gonna runaway from the day
We're gonna run
Gonna run
Gonna runaway from the day

We're gonna run

I found the permanent place
Where the skies are gold not grey
We're gonna run
We're gonna run
Ooh
