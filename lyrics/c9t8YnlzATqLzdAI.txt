Run, baby, run
You've got so many things to do
Sleep while you can
Cause tomorrow will not feel new

Growing too fast
All this labor with no good fruit
Tear it off, cut it into two

I can't wait for another morning
Wake up, babe, wake up with me
If the ceiling isn't rumblin' with children
I might just let you sleep

I can't wait to make another decision
Maybe we will know what we want by then
