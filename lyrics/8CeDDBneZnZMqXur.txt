Stuck in the past
Like drawing rings around Saturn
Shadow is cast
But now it follows a pattern

I don't know what that arrangement was
I could never tell
But you could
I don't spare the horses leveled with the smell
But you would

Stuck in the past
A planet only on paper
Guess I'm the last
I live in memory of vapor

I don't know what that arrangement was
I could never tell
Like you could
I don't spare that just
because hoping it was a well

I had all this time while Houston dozed
Where I almost had a line composed
But the moment passed, the hatch is closed

Stuck in the past
Where I'll be pulling that lever
It happened so fast
And then it happens forever

I don't know what that arrangement was
I could never tell
Like you could

Stuck in the past
Just drawing rings around Saturn
