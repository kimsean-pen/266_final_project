my mind's blank anyway I never have a thing to say
And if I do, write a song about it
This ain't therapy it's too crowded
Personality drowned out And stomped And soundless
Maimed even if you claimed Style is
sound, bitch Might as well be talkin'
To myself up here
You never listen
What you fear is if you Listen you might hear some shit
So I clear these clips And hope the recoil kicks
I ain't trying to appease spoiled kids
See them down, boil with the boy Skull rapping that Hamlet
They know that I'm ill Can't stand it
I don't fuck with the gang Can't stand it
I'm too fat for these hoops They demandin'
I'm not a stand in

(yeah) I'm my own man
You better watch your mouth
Cause I'm my own man, I ain't
Holdin' back for no one else
I'ma show you who I am with my Own hands,
I'ma cold man, own man
I'ma do it my way 'til I'ma old man
You better feel what I say from my soul, man
I'ma own man

That's okay, my mind's blank anyway
I never have a thing to say
And if I do,
I ain't tellin' you I been silent
for a minute Growin' up with my nephews
I was an alcoholic quitting cold Turkey in the cabin
When at home I had to clean out the cabinet
When at home I had to clean out the contacts
Just some people who would never call me back
Then I drop 100 pounds like a lad In a lap dance, magic up in my pen
Ya'll are writing something tragic Stanzas, can't stand up, re-branded
Damage, asinine, anti-aspirin Outlandish rapping
Only for the cash Mercenary ass
Can't hold a damn candle to a light bulb
BING, Google and Bing me, king me
If you wanna compete,
boy You catch me in a different kind of scenery, singin'

I'ma own man, own man
You better watch your fuckin' mouth
Cause I'm my own man, I ain't
Holdin' back for no one else
I'ma show you who I am with my own hands
I'ma cold man, own man, I'ma do it my way 'til
I'm an old man,
you better feel what I say from my soul, man, I'm my own man, own man

Swelling the empty of night time
That's why I feel like I'm the only man alive
Maybe I am, that's why I write all these things
You know?
Away from all the snakes who bite
And the biters who snake
Away from the screams
And the pressure
And the invisible favors
Away from homie prophecies
And hindsight heroes
Away from you, (away from you)
