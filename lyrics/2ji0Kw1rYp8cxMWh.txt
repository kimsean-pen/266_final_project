How do you feel anything at all?
Do you hear steps at the door?
Do you reckon the smell of...?
It's life
The dark that binds you

Frigthened by your own smell
Bitternes will run you through

Silent screaming
Turning, twisting the alphabet
Frantic eyes
Awaiting the answer
Splinters of a poem
Fragments of what you used to be
Habitual and gullible
Run-down memoirs is all that's left

Do you wish to sleep?
Do you aim for the shadow?
Do you feel all infected?
It's life
The dark that binds you

Frigthened by your own smell
Bitternes will run you through

Silent screaming
Turning, twisting the alphabet
Frantic eyes
Awaiting the answer
Splinters of a poem
Fragments of what you used to be
Habitual and gullible
Run-down memoirs is all that's left

It's the cowardice that pulls you under
And takes you to the end, where it begins
Release, the world is waiting your arrival
Close your eyes, as we witness another bullet ride

Do you know about atrocity?
Do you know that everbody's gone?
Do you know that you're on your own?
It's life
The dark that binds you

Frigthened by your own smell
Bitternes will run you through

Silent screaming
Turning, twisting the alphabet
Frantic eyes
Awaiting the answer
Splinters of a poem
Fragments of what you used to be
Habitual and gullible
Run-down memoirs is all that's left
