Everyday
Every afternoon
Tried so hard
But lost to God

I thought you're my friend
I'll guess again
I look to the clouds
God gives me a frown

This time next year I'll be married
This time next year I'll say sorry
But Jesus stole my girlfriend
Jesus stole my girlfriend

A smile and a wink
Meant more than a kiss
But I don't see the world
Like you do, girl

We ate and we sung
To glory and fun
But Jesus is here
He ate up our fears

This time next year I'll be married
This time next year I'll say sorry
But Jesus stole my girlfriend
Jesus stole my girlfriend

Ask a friend what to do
I wrote a prayer and made it out to you
Angels listened but they knew I was true
Say our prayers, lift our hands, lift our hands
Glorious

This time next year I'll be married
This time next year I'll say sorry
But Jesus stole my girlfriend
But Jesus stole my girlfriend
But Jesus stole my girlfriend
But Jesus stole my girlfriend
