Stones
On weathered shore
You were the one
And I will always be there

You wrapped
Your loving arms
Around my doubt
I am tired of that

And this won't get broken

Home
On our front porch
All broken down
And I will always be there

Rest
Your weary head
Dismiss your doubt
I will always be

This won't get broken
