We found our place
On the branch of an old oak tree

our feet would sway
to a voice in the breeze

and birds would sing
on the banks of a narrow stream

these memories will stay with me

(oohhhhhooooo)

we make our way
to a hill beside the sea

with salt in the air
and sand on our feet

we fought the sun
as a burn upon our skin

these memories will stay with me.

now i am far away
these memories still remain

now I'm far away
you stay with me the same

(ooohhhhhhhoooo)

now I'm far away
these memories still remain

now I'm far away
you stay with me the same.

(oohhhhhooooo)
