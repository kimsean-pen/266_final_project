It"s no use we're gonna have to fight
You've thrown your words 'round a thousand times
Like a child who can't empathize
You don't speak the language you don't read my signs

You wanna know what I really think
You wanna know what I really believe
There's a fire burning up in here
See the smoke coming out of my ears

Oh no, we both know
More trouble's gonna find us, if we're all alone
I wanna show you what I really mean
But you're always on the outside looking in

Oh won't you come into my head
Come inside ride out in my head
Oh won't you come into my head
I just wanna have you up in my head

Look through my eyes, I'm your binocular
And every time you'll get a shock you'll learn
What it's like to be in my dimension
Let me be the center of your attention

Come listen to the sounds I hear
The quiet prose and the crack in my snare
Make your mark on my territory
Carve your name in every cavity

Oh no, we both know
More trouble's gonna find us, if we're all alone
I wanna show you what I really mean
But you're always on the outside looking in

Oh won't you come into my head
Come inside ride out in my head
Oh won't you come into my head
I just wanna have you up in my head

Oh boy, come into my head
Come inside ride out in my head
Oh boy, come into my head
I just wanna have you up in my head

Oh you wanna piece of my mind?
Emphatic and erratic at the drop of a dime
Oh you want to read my mind?
Climatic and dramatic like Jekyll and Hyde
Oh you want to read my mind?
Emphatic and erratic at the drop of a dime
Oh you wanna piece of my mind?
Da da da da da da da da da da da da

Da-la-da-da da-la-da-da da-la-da
Da-la-da-da da-la-da-da da-la-da
Ha-la-da-da da-la-ha da-la-da
Like a blood running through my veins
It's my DNA and my chemistry
From the pews of the congregation
Now, I'll never know the real salvation

You wanna know what I really mean baby
You wanna know what I really need
There's a fire burning up in here
See the smoke coming out of my ears

Oh boy, come into my head
Come inside ride out in my head
Oh boy, come into my head
I just wanna have you up in my head

Oh you want a piece of my mind?
Climatic and dramatic like Jekyll and Hyde
Oh you want a piece of my mind?
Emphatic and erratic at the drop of a dime

Oh want a piece of my mind?
