Remembrance still as clear as the sky
Blood for blood
Eye for an eye
A retribution

Rusty steel into the bone
Pierce the spine
One by one
Shatter them all

No distance to long
No yourney too wearying
I will hunt i will seek

And destroy
I am the hammer, i am the blade
I will lacerate, tear and slay

Only the blood
Running warm
Turning to cold on the snow
Can release me from this retaliation

Across the oceans
Thru the lands
Barren and bleak

Over the summits of ice
Where the moon is high
But the peaks are rising higher

I will set this world on fire

Fire black flames of desolation
Fire the force of a thousand suns
Fire the blaze of hatred and wrath
Fire my vengeance
Ignites the conflagration

In the edge of our world
Guardians of darkness and light

In the fringe of our world
Defender of the sun
And the keeper of the night

Passing the woods where pines
Needles are black
And deep are the roots
Piercing the frozen soil
Piercing the ice eternal
