And do you really want this?
Don't think you've got what it takes?
Remember when you said you got me
Now you've got nothing to say
And can't you see what's going on here?
I feel we're fading away
And I don't know why you don't trust me
I've had your back from the day

And I dare you
I dare you to come 'round
And I dare you
Say it to my face now
And I dare you
I dare you to come round
And if you're gonna play the game
I'm gonna put you in your place now

And now you've really pushed me
You've pushed me close to the edge
I'm tryin' to keep this shit together
Trying not lose my head
I really want all this to work out
But please don't make the mistake
Of thinking if that I'm not with you
That I'm gonna break

And I dare you
I dare you to come 'round
And I dare you
Say it to my face now
And I dare you
I dare you to come round
And if you're gonna play the game
I'm gonna put you in your place now

And I dare
I fucking dare you

And I dare you
I dare you to come 'round
And I dare you
Say it to my face now
And I dare you
I dare you to come 'round
And if you're gonna play the game
I'm gonna put you in your place now

And I dare
I fucking dare you
And I dare
I fucking dare you
