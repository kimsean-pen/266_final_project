How could this take so long
It's been ages, dear
Through these wasted months
Waiting patiently
'Til you made me see

What I think this is interesting
I want you to buckle when you think of me
I wish I could bottle what I think you need
I want you to buckle when you think of me
I want you to buckle when you see

You knew me from afar
What you make of me
You proved that I was wrong
About everything
And you made me see

What I think this is interesting
I want you to buckle when you think of me
I wish I could bottle everything you need
I want you to buckle when you think of me
I want you to buckle when you see

What not keep this interesting
I want you to buckle when you think of me
I wish I could bottle everything you need
I promise you something that I wish you'd see
I want you to buckle when you think of me
I want you to buckle when you see
