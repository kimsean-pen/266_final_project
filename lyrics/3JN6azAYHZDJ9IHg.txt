I can't keep a straight face
And say this is not the end
Not if you want it, it's upon us
And I wanna say it's sinking in

This may sound crazy
But I wanna come back home
That's it, I said it, now I'm sailing off
To Never Land and then Japan

So think real slow
Don't forget that yes is yes and no is no
About the way you wanna go
'Cause you may forget the way to get back home

This is the end if you want it
This is the end

You're not the first thing in my life
I've loved and lost
Yeah, I've done worse things
That I might be less inclined to really just shrug off

I took the fire escape
And made it out alive
Yeah, I still burn from time to time
But I've a healing hand against my side

So think real slow
Don't forget that yes is yes and now is no
About the way you wanna go
'Cause you may forget the way to get back home

This is the end if you want it
This is the end if you want it
This is the end
