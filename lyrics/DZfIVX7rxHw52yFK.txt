In this day aspiration's star decayed
It was the light of our desires
A fire burns in the mind
Torching once fundamental truths

Downfall
Downfall

Self-loathing, it's your state of mind
Drowning in dejection
Homicidal of your talents
It's mental suicide

Downfall
Downfall
Downfall
Downfall

One by one they all drown
Down the path, I can't hear
To feel this pain with you
To feel this pain with you
To feel this pain, I'm falling to grey
To feel this pain with you

Buried dreams, will-withered, dried
Sorrow is your guide
You haven't the will to carry on
You'll feel better when you're gone

Downfall
Downfall
Downfall
Downfall

One by one they all drown
Down the path, I can't hear
To feel this pain with you
To feel this pain with you
To feel this pain, I'm falling to grey
To feel this pain with you

If I may realign the scriptures
For fallacy's decay
Reclamation of the spirit
First step in taking back your life

Downfall
Downfall
Downfall
Downfall

One by one they all drown
Down the path, I can't hear
To feel this pain with you
To feel this pain with you
To feel this pain, I'm falling to grey
To feel this pain with you
