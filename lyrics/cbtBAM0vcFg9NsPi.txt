It's cold.
Snowing
Blue light dusk settles
A fire
Burns with
Failing light
Against
The growing
Darkness
Bending over the dying flames
You were with me then and always
Through the
Fluttering
Veil of
Frozen blue,
A hooded
Figure cuts its path
To cleave the night
In two.
Pull its
Outer husk
From its body
And the rest
Escapes,
And there upon the ground the remnants of our struggle.
This is the ghost key
This is our ghost key
This is our ghost key
