The stage is set, the disillusion begins
You tell yourself that you can't believe them
They're gonna say what they want you to hear
You should be dead now just like the rest

You took your shots, and I swallowed the bullets
You did your worst and I'm dying to prove it
They're gonna say what they want you to hear
You should be dead now just like the rest

They'll forget you, and everything that you are
Stop pretending, you're just like the rest

I'm where you wanna be, and I can see straight till the end
When the lights go out you know that it's all or it's nothing
I know that we, we will hold our own
When the lights go out you know that it's all or it's nothing

We won't fall!

The stage is set, the panic's starting to grow
You see the terror in no tomorrow
They're gonna say what they want you to hear
You should be dead now just like the rest

They will forget you, and everything that you are
So stop pretending, you're just like the rest

I'm where you wanna be, and I can see straight till the end
When the lights go out you know that it's all or it's nothing
I know that we, we will hold our own
When the lights go out you know that it's all or it's nothing

We won't fall!

This lives in all of us, this lives in all of you

I can see in the light of your eyes, I can see through all the lies
This lives in all of us, inside of all of us!

Inside of us all!
