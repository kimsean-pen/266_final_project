The dirty lord of the manor
Surveys his filthy domain
Too many nights raising hell
Worked a little all too well
Constructed a monument
To denial and excess
Sunk so low,
Crawled so far back
Theres nowhere left to regress
If these walls could talk,
They would tell a horror story
Never-ending winter,
Violence and infidelity
Shadows fall through broken panes
Careless words that are filled with hate
Just enough to keep it together,
Never enough to make it work
All the tongues
Here are forked
We are a hailstorm of broken glass,
Follow the path of least expectance
A huge
Stinking pile of sick,
Pile it
Higher and higher
Light the match,
Start the fire
Level this place until
Nothings left
And take us with it

Surroundings are irate.
Crack of dawn
Brings naught but pain
Resentment steadily grows
Laughing in the gallows
Full throttle
Determined to fail,
Pedal to the metal
Asleep at the wheel
We are the lucky ones,
Welcome home
Pile it
Higher and higher
Light the match,
Start the fire
Level this place until
Nothings left
And take us with it

Poisoned nerves
And a bloody antidote
Violence is not
An abberration,
Its a rule
Dying beyond the pale
Your beatings will continue
Until my morale improves
I dont hate you,
Im just removing an enemy
Remorse is for the dead
Raaa
Im just removing an enemy
Enemy
Enemy
Enemy
Remorse is for the dead,
My enemy
Enemy
Enemy
Remorse is for the dead.
The dead
The dead
The dead
The dead
The dead
