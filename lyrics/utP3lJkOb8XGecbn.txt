Well, you can give me all your love
And anything else you got too
But don't pay it any mind
If it seems like I'm acting cool

Well, you can dress me in your mirror
Give me kisses forever and a day yeah
But there's just one thing
You don't have to say
You don't have to say you love me
And you don't have to say any prayers
No, you don't have to say you love me
Baby, it's alright

'Cause honey, I don't care
Oh, baby, I don't care
Oh, honey, I don't care
Oh, honey, I don't care

Well, you can turns the lights down low
Somethings are better that way
And you can tell me all your stories
But please, spare me the plays

'Cause you don't have to say you love me
And you don't have to save any tears
No, you don't have to say you love me
Baby, it's alright

'Casue, honey, I don't care
Oh, honey, I don't care
Oh, baby, I don't care
Oh, honey, I don't care

Deep in your eyes
I see your thoughts
I know you want me
Sometimes it hurts
But you know that some things
Are best left never said

'Cause you don't have to say you love me
And you don't have to say you care
No, you don't have to say you love me
Baby, it's alright

'Cause, honey, I don't care

Oh, when I tell you baby, I don't care
Oh, baby, please believe me, I don't care
Oh, when I tell you baby, I don't care
Oh baby, please believe me, I don't care

Oh baby, please believe me, don't you see that I don't care
Oh baby, I don't care
Oh, baby, I don't care
You know, you know baby, I don't care
You know, you know

That you don't have to say you love me
And you don't have to say you care
No, you don't have to say you love me
Baby, it's alright, oh honey, it's alright
Oh baby, I don't care
Oh honey, I don't care
