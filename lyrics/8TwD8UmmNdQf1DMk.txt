If we're the flagship of peace and prosperity
We're taking on water and about to fuckin' sink
No one seems to notice, no one even blinks
The crew left the passengers to die under the sea

Countdown to the very end
Equality, an invitation that we wont extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now
Its time you firmly secure your place in hell

State of the union address
Reads war torn country still a mess
The words, power, death, and distorted truth
Are read between the lines of the red, white, and blue

Countdown to the very end
Equality, an invitation that we wont extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now
Its time you firmly secure your place in hell

Your place in hell
Your place in hell

Guilty is what our graves will read
No year, no family, we did nothing
To stop the murder of
Of people, just like us
