We're having a party
Dancing to the music
Played by the DJ
On the radio

The cokes are in the icebox
The popcorn's on the table
Me and my baby
We're out here on the floor

So listen, Mr. DJ
Keep those records playing
'Cause I'm having such a good time
Dancing with my baby

Everybody's swinging
Sally's doing that twist now
If you take requests, I've
Got a few for you

Play that song called "Soul Twist"
Play that one called "I Know"
Don't forget them "Mashed Potatoes"
No other songs will do

Let me tell you Mr., Mr. DJ
Keep those records playing
'Cause I'm having such a good time
Dancing with my baby

Having a party- Yeah
Everybody's swinging- Oh we're
Dancing to the music- Yeah
On the radio- Oh we're

Having a party- Man
Everybody's swinging
Dancing to the music- Yeah
On the radio- Tell 'em one more time

We're having a party- Yeah
Everybody's swinging- Oh we're
Dancing to the music- Yeah
On the radio- Tellin' ya

We're having a party- Yeah
Everybody's swinging
