I'm in love with your brother
What's his name?
I thought I'd come by to see him again

And when you two danced
Oh what a dance
And when you two laughed
Oh what a laugh

Has he mentioned my age, love
Or is he more into young girls
With dyed black hair?
I'm in love with your brother
I thought I'd come by

I'm in love with your brother
Yes, I am, but maybe I
Shouldn't ask for his name

And when you two danced
Oh what a dance
And when you two laughed
Oh what a laugh

Does he know what I do?
You pass this on, won't you
If I asked him once what would he say
Is he willing, can he play?

I wasn't really looking for some more than
Some company on the dance floor
Does he know what I do?
You pass this on, won't you
