The sad queen of everything
Buys her way into your dreams
To burn the evil palace down
And drag the corpse out of the
ground
To take zolpidem at heaven's gate
To purify this holy weight
Drag your claws across the sea
Crying over everything you eat

Held apart, begging your fear
To hold your hand for one more year
Prostitutes for hope align
The bad ideas inside your mind
That turn your thoughts away from
love
Toward slave driving karmic blood
You're giving birth in the prison pit
No one cares, it's easier to quit

No one cares, it's easier to quit
No one cares, it's easier to quit
No one cares, it's easier to quit
No one cares, it's easier
