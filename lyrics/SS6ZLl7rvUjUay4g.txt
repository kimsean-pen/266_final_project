Wise men say - only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Wise men say - only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you.

Shall I stay - would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you.

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand - take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you.

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand - take my whole life too
I can't help falling in love with you.
I cant help falling in love with you
I cant help falling in love with you
I cant help falling in love with you
