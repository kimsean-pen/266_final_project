You're crystal clear
Facing the light
Don't disappear
It's just what I imagined

So happy here
Everything's right
It's crystal clear
Is this real?

I wake from my bed
Am I lost in my head?
Am I lost in my bedroom again?
It's just what I imagined,
I'm lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined
It's just what I imagined,
I'm lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined

Suddenly strange
Everything is right
Inside my brain
It's just what I imagined

Something's not right
Shadows appear
I close my eyes
Is this real?

I wake from my bed
Am I lost in my head?
Am I lost in my bedroom again?
It's just what I imagined,
I'm lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined
It's just what I imagined,
I'm lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined

It's just what I imagined
I'm lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined

It's just what I imagined
I'm lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined

I wake from my bed
Am I lost in my head?
Am I lost in my bedroom again?
It's just what I imagined,
I'm lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined
It's just what I imagined,
I'm lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined

It's just what I imagined
I'm lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined

It's just what I imagined
I'm lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined

It's just what I imagined
I'm lost in my bedroom
It's just what I imagined
