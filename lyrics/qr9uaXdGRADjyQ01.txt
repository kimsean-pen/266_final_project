Everyday that I awake, I must be mindful
That everyday is all I have to call my own
It's everyday the sun will rise
Even though the dark clouds seem so low
It will only tell the truth, we are alone
Everyday that I believe, I must be mindful
That every belief I have is all I own
Ten thousand roads will all return here
Only reaping what they've sown
And it will only tell the truth, we are alone
We are all alone
Each one his own
We are all alone together
We are not without
What it's all about
We are all alone
With each other
Everyday that I awake, I must be mindful
That everyday is all we have for us to change
To see everything as it really is
Everything we have, we have to give
And it will only tell the truth, we are alone
We are all alone
Each one his own
We are all alone together
We are not without
What it's all about
We are all alone
We are all alone
We are all alone
With each other
