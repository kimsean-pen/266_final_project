Well I hate your fucking face
And the way you always made fun of me for biting my nails
You think I'm not as smart as you
Think I'm not cool enough to keep up with crowd you associate with
Tried reading a new book, its hard not to look
But I can't help from wondering what you're up to now
But it's not my place
So I'll give you your space

Fuck me up
'Cause I can't remember just who I was before I met you
A better person, a prop to use then throw away

I need a break
'Cause for some reason I only get tired in the morning
And I feel so boring

I don't think these wounds will heal themselves
And if they do it won't be 'cause you helped
You never fucking helped
You never fucking cared
You only ever cared about yourself

I never thought it'd be so hard
We haven't spoken since last March
I try to cut you out
But I still care about you
I'll always fucking care about you
