I don't want to fight anymore
Just take my hand
Please, tell me everything, my love
I'll understand
If it is wrong
Then let's be damned

I hate to tell you in a song that I love you
I hate to tell you in some song that I love you

Heart and soul
I just don't know
If I give everything I have
Will you not go?
How could I bare to
No, I won't share you

I hate to tell you in a song that I love you
I hate to tell you in some song that I love you

You're right
Too right
You've shown me, and I can't deny
You're right
Too right
Forever on your side

Turn around, turn around, turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around
I'm found
How could I bare to
No, I won't share you, no

I hate to tell you in a song that I love you
I hate to tell you in some song that I love you
