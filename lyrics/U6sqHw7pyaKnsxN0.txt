Yes, I mean to offend
I am not your friend
Put me down again
Take, take it all away
I am not insane
I need to cut the chain

It's time to sever all our ties
Time to say those fake goodbyes
You're a car crash
You're a bar fight
You're a fallback
You're a snakebite

Yes, I mean to offend
I am not your friend
Put me down again

I blamed you for my pain inside
Because I can't confront my lies
I'm a monster
I'm a burnout
An imposter
I'm a blackout

Yes, I mean to offend
I am not your friend
Put me down again
Take, take it all away
I am not insane
I need to cut the chain
