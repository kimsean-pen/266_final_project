I could read your mind
I know what you're thinking
This is not what you signed up for
I could pray to God
But I'm not invested
And you get what you pay for

I've been trying to find out if anyone
Feels truly happy because of all that they have done
Cause I always seem to want more
Provided that I can get some

There's me in the corner throwing a fit
Making a mess of it
Don't you love me now?
There's me under the table, hiding from my
Lovers and my allies
Don't you love me now?
It's just a hypothesis or test, that I should not exist
Don't you love me now?
There's me in the doorway telling you please
You should just let me leave
If you love me now

I could bite my tongue
Trying not to say that my love
For you looks different
I could bide my time
Hoping I could fix it
But it goes against my instincts

And I've been trying to find out if anyone
Feels super sure that they are deserving of someone
Cause I always seem to give it up
Provided that I can get some

There's me in the corner throwing a fit
Making a mess of it
Don't you love me now?
There's me under the table hiding from my
Lovers and my allies
Don't you love me now?
It's just a hypothesis or test, that I should not exist
Don't you love me now?
There's me in the doorway telling you please
You should just let me leave
If you love me now

It's just a hypothesis or test, that I should not exist
Don't you love me now
There's me in the doorway telling you please
You should just let me leave
If you love me now
