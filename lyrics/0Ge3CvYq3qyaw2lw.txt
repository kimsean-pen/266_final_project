There's a daylight going under
There's a new spark to discover
And you know we're not getting any younger
So remember,
this is our time

I want to drive
an open road
Can we go out tonight
Anything goes

Let's make a monument for our love, our love,
our love, our love
Let's make a monument for our love, our love
our love, our love

There's a memory around the corner
There's an angel on our shoulders
To remind us life is far from over
So remember,
this is our time

I want to drive
an open road
Can we go out tonight
Anything goes

Let's make a monument for our love, our love,
our love, our love
Let's make a monument for our love, our love
our love, our love

Every night is ours to own
Everywhere is ours to roam
Every sun is sunshine gold
Everywhere

Let's make a monument for our love, our love
Another monument for our love, our love

Our love, our love

Let's make a monument for our love, our love
Another monument for our love, our love
