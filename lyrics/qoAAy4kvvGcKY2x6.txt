See me driving down the street
I'm bored with looking good
I got both hands off the wheel
The cops are coming

I'm listening to the music with no fear
You can hear it too if you're sincere

'Cause I'm a punk rocker, yes I am
Well I'm a punk rocker, yes I am
'Cause I'm a punk rocker, yes I am
Well I'm a punk rocker, yes I am

I see you stagger in the street
And you can't stay on your feet
And you're faking in your sleep
You wish that you were deep

But you can't hear me laughing to myself
If you could, you would be someone else

'Cause I'm a punk rocker, yes I am
Well I'm a punk rocker, yes I am
'Cause I'm a punk rocker, yes I am
Well I'm a punk rocker, yes I am

See me die on Bleecker Street
I'm bored with being god
See me sneering in my car
I'm driving to my star

I'm listening to the music with no fear
You can hear it too if you're sincere

'Cause I'm a punk rocker, yes I am
Well I'm a punk rocker, yes I am
'Cause I'm a punk rocker, yes I am
Well I'm a punk rocker, yes I am
'Cause I'm a punk rocker, yes I am
Well I'm a punk rocker, yes I am
