The day is incomplete
The thoughts of total defeat
I don't know what is happening to me
Or if I'll die, 'cause I just never sleep

You awoke into my night
You could see the madness in my eyes

I've lost control, please save me from myself
I've lost control, please save me from myself

My conscience begs for time
'Cause you can't fight the clock
Ticking inside
I'm just a bigger baby me
Acting smart, oh what irony

Where will I end up, tonight?
Getting fucked or frying my mind

I've lost control, please save me from myself
I've lost control, please save me from myself

Calm me down with your caress
I'll get off while I watch you undress
Maybe the sex will help me to forget
A precious, transient schizophrenic bliss

Oh, my god, you're beautiful
Why do you stay with this neurotic fool?

I've lost control, please save me from myself
I've lost control, please save me from myself
I've lost control, please save me from myself
