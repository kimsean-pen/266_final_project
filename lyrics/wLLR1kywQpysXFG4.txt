When I met you
I never knew
'Bout other things you see me through

When I met you
I never knew
'Bout other things that we would do

Then I met you

When I met you

I met me too

Listen

Sometimes it takes baby mamas
To show you, you don't need the drama

Once so high like marijuana
You won't wanna hit no other

Listen to me when I tell you
That without him, there would be no you

So yes, I thanked my ex
A little still

Cause without him, how would we know
Our love is really real

When I met you
I never knew
'Bout other things you see me through

When I met you
I never knew
'Bout other things that we would do

Then I met you

When I met you

I met me too

Listen
Sometimes it takes fireplaces
To show you, you don't need to chase him

And sometimes it takes flowers and good wine
To show you, you don't need the late nights

Listen to me when I tell you
That without him, there would be no you

So yes, I thanked my ex
A little still

Cause without him, how would we know
That our love is really real

When I met you
I never knew
'Bout other things you see me through

When I met you
I never knew
'Bout other things that we would do

Then I met you

When I met you

I met me too

I met me too
When I met you, baby, whoa
When I met you
Met me too

When I met you
I never knew
'Bout other things you see me through

When I met you
I never knew
'Bout other things that we would do

Then I met you

When I met you

I met me too

"I met me too when I met you
I-I still remember the day
It was, it was... beautiful, yeah

Um... If I hadn't went through the things I'd went before
Then I wouldn't know how special you are

Now, my eyes would still be closed

And, um, now, there wide open

Because I met you."
