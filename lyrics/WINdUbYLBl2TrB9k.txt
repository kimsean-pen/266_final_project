While this black cloud follows me
Open my chest and feel me weep
The world opens its crust for me
Rain down on me, God, swallow me

Through caverns wide and oceans deep
I drag my weary head and feet
Rain down on me, God, swallow me
The Black Dog will not let me be

While this black cloud follows me
And forces me down to my knees
Open your crust Earth and swallow me
While this black cloud follows me

I followed you, got on my knees
Rain down on me, please let me sleep
Open the earth and swallow me
I'm begging you, let me be free

Through caverns wide and oceans deep
I drag my weary head and feet
Rain down on me, God, swallow me
The Black Dog will not let me be

While this black cloud follows me
And forces me down to my knees
Open your crust Earth and swallow me
While this black cloud follows me

They said you died to set us free
So I chained myself down on my knees
They said you died to set us free
So I chained myself down on my knees
Down on my knees

This black cloud follows me
And forces me down to my knees
Open your crust Earth and swallow me
While this black cloud follows me

While this black cloud follows me
And forces me down to my knees
Open your crust Earth and swallow me
While this black cloud follows me

Black cloud
Black cloud
Black cloud
Black cloud
While this black cloud follows me
