Born to live and born to die
Aren't they just the same?
We're always breaking someone's heart
Especially our own
Life goes on its joyful way
As usual nothing's as it seems
But to die a good death is my dream

And I wish it for all, for all I know and love
Deep down below and high above
We're born to die, no one to blame
We're born to love, we're all the same

Blues stay away, stay away from me
I hate to lose old friends
Blues are my enemy, but love gets me through
Born to live and die
Forever loving you
Don't make me cry, know what I must do
Pray for a good death, one for me, one for you

And I wish it for all, for all I know and love
Deep down below and high above
We're born to die, no one to blame
We're born to love, we're all the same
