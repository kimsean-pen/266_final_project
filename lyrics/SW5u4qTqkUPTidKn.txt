Want you to keep it in line
I want you to keep it in line
I want you to keep it in line
I want you to keep it in line

You got caught and you gave it away
And then I cancelled on ya
It got hot, yeah, and you did okay
And then I cancelled on ya
I got a version in my head
That they were laying it on ya
But then with me instead

You pumped up and it lasted all day
I think I better inform ya
Got eyes in my back and, yeah, I see you okay
You know I'd never report ya

I got my version, they got theirs
That they were laying it on ya
But then with me in there

Want you to keep it in line
I want you to keep it in line
I want you to keep it in line
I want you to keep it in line

I think about it and I'm always almost there
I need a daily reminder
That I could be anywhere

I got all my stuff in the USA
I got a little bit on ya
I will pack it all together, I will ship it away
And then you spread it all over

I got all of my versions in my head
That they were laying it on ya
But then with me instead

Want you to keep it in line
I want you to keep it in line
I want you to keep it in line
I want you to keep it in line

Want you to keep it in line
I want you to keep it in line
I want you
