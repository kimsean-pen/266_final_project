I can't waste away, I'm slowly losing my way forever
Better raise your slave for me anymore
Daylight's sin inside, day's growing closer, wait for pain
I cannot wait another night to be alone

Voices are calling me, be my night!, this devil's sigh
Yeah, shadows are tainting me, yeah
I know that only you can render pain

Peace of mind, you run away from me
So make me lose my mask of sanity

I can't waste away, I'm slowly getting my way forever
Better is when I used to be alone
Shattered light's sin in taint, day's growing longer, wait for pain
I cannot wait another night to be with you

Peace of mind, you run away from me
So make me lose my mask of sanity
Peace of mind, you run away from me
So make me lose my mask of sanity
