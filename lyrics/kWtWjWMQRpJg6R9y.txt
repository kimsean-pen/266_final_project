Well stranger,
I know nothing.
I better take a time at this time.
I know you said, but im sorry.
I want to work it out.
All my friends are also your friends.
And that makes you less a stranger.
And your name,
Ive hearded it somewhere,
But i still want to work it out.
With all do respect,
Your kisses make me mad.
But dont worry,
Ill keep my eyes on you.
Why is this so weird,
I feel ive known you for years.
You can sleep,
Ill just keep my eyes on you.
Im already glad that i met you.
I like to see life from your eyes.
Doesnt matter what awaits us.
I will deal with that surprise.
Even though i know you have a lot in your mind,
The future, the pass and the planes you might fly.
I just want to tell you, that this love is true.
Youre a stranger, but youre mine.
