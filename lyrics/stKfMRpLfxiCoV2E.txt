Onslaught of feelings
My head hits the ceiling
Must be from standing up so tall
I'll hold my breath until I fall
Rearrange, re-orchestrate the feelings that you bought
You got me, but I don't think I got you

Ghosts play their part
Dance over graves
Just don't look at me the same
Because I can't always change

Stop making sense
The stories were true
I am nothing without you
I can't control these legs
I think I'll let them flail
And black out on the corner of Milwaukee
Where the cross streets tend to blur with all the other words
I thought I could make the transfer, but nothing ever came

There are six different paths I can take
Pull my shoulders back and hear them ache
Pull back as far as I can
Hopefully you'll want me then
