Ohh
The top feels so much better than the bottom
So much better

Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelery store, lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership, tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

Summertime, white Porche Carrera is milky
I'm on the grind let my paper stack when I'm filthy
It's funny how niggas get the screw facin' at me
Anyhow, they aint got the heart to get at me
I'll get down, Southside's the hood that I come from
So I don't cruise to nobody hood without my gun
You know the kid ain't gon' fall for all that bullshit
Try and stick me, I'ma let off a full clip
It ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up
At the dice game, who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when their paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all niggas better act right
When we got the tops down, you can hear the system thump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'
Shut your block down, quick to put a hole in a chump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'

Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelery store, looking at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership, tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

Niggas love me in L.A. as soon as I pop in
They come scoop me up at LAX and I hop in
Now when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach, some from Watts, some from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali' girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spittin' G at a bitch like a pimp man
Tell her, meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang
She can bring the lingerie with her I suppose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just having no clothes
She can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next man
Listen man, shit changed, I came up, I'm doin' my thang
Homie, I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'
Oh shit, man, the store owner watchin' you
'Fore something get stolen, stolen, stolen

Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelery store, lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership, tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by
