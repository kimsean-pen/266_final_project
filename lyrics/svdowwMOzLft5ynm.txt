You said you don't love me like that.
I am stuck here standing in the rain.
You said I don't need you like that,
But I do,
But I do.
I am telling that sun to come back.
You feel me fading in the grave.
Blue skies don't tease me like that,
Like you do,
Like you do.
I'm feeling like the world's about to change,
When humming birds are singing in the rain.
Dreaming, that I'm standing in the light.
Do you love me?

Can you feel the sunshine?
(You make it brighter.)
Make it brighter,
Make it brighter for me!
When that sun comes shining on me.

Feels like the storm's holding back.
Soon I'll be swimming in the dream.
I walk, but I fall off the track
To the blue,
To the blue.
But I don't want to look the other way,
And I don't want to wake up in the paining,
Dreaming of that rainy summer day.
Do you love me?

Can you feel the sunshine
Make it brighter,
make it brighter for me.
When that sun comes shining on me.

I said:
Can you feel the sunshine?
Make it brighter,
Make it brighter for me.
When that sun comes shining on me.

Can you feel the sunshine?
Make it brighter,
Make it brighter for me.
When that sun comes shining on me.

I said:
Can you feel the sunshine?
Make it brighter,
Make it brighter for me.
When that sun comes shining on me.
