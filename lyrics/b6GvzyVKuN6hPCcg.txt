Saw you stretched out in room ten o nine
With a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye
Could not seem to get a line on you, my sweet honey love

And Berber jewelry jangling down the street
Making bloodshot eyes at every woman that you meet
Could not seem to get a high on you, my sweet honey love, yeah

May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun

When you're drunk in the alley with your clothes all torn
When your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn
Just seemed too many flies on you, I just can't brush them off

And the angels beating all their wings in time
With smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes
Could not seem to get a high on you
Come on up now, come on up now, come on up

May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song you sing your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun, yeah yeah
Come on up now, come on up now, come on up now, come on up
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song you sing your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun, yeah
