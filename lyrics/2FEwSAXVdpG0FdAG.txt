Keep it out, keep it in

If everybody is searching for the same shelter
Why does anyone think it's theirs to know?
Collective bodies so hungry for the touch of a stranger
Magic contact, believe you're not alone

Keep it out, keep it in
I'll keep you out, so you never see me unraveling

We seek to settle, we make a home
It's fun for a little, but soon it's old
And so it withers like all the rest
Till we're sleeping like strangers
On the opposite sides of the bed

Keep it out, keep it in
I'll keep you out, so you never see me unraveling
You want all the promises made
But I don't have the energy to suffice
Watch me while I disengage
You might even feel nice
