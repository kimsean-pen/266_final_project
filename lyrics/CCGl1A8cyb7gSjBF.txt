Show me the way you make my dreaming okay
You love my hair because it grows every day
We get so happy with the hearts that we break
Hairspray, gasoline, and rollerskates

It grows on and on and on and on
It grows on and on and on and on
We smashed all of your all of your all of your friends
We smashed all of your all of your all of your friends

Show me the way you make my dreaming okay
You love my hair because it grows every day
We get so happy with the hearts that we break
Hairspray, gasoline, and rollerskates

It grows on and on and on and on
It grows on and on and on and on
We smashed all of your all of your all of your friends
We smashed all of your all of your all of your friends

I hate my hair, I'm so deep
Cut you a lock you can keep
You give me all I want
Subliminally in my sleep
