Now you go unseen, perfect you'll stay hidden
and i can dream of things you'll never see
alli please, if you are braver than the rest,
there's little left that could dispute your claim

And when you'd finally gone,
he tells me "he was dead all along"
He was wrong, he hadn't lived a day
the way you lived your final days
A teenager in Love with Christ and Heroin

Now you feel ashamed
but he feels nothing of the kind
He talks of things he wouldn't mind to try sometime,

But you've got little left to give
His touch is not a thing you'll ever miss

And when you'd finally gone,
he tells me "he was dead all along"
He was wrong, he hadn't lived a day
the way you lived your final days
A teenager in Love with Christ and Heroin

And if you made a stand,
I would stand with you 'til the end
But you don't need a friend when you're
a teenager in love with Christ and Heroin
