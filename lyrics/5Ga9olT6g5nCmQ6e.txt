Somewhere along the way
My hopefulness turned to sadness
Somewhere along the way
My sadness turned to bitterness

Somewhere along the way
My bitterness turned to anger
Somewhere along the way
My anger turned to vengeance
And the ones that I made pay

Were never the ones who deserved it.
And the ones who deserved it
They'll never understand it.
Yes, I know I'm going to hell in a purple basket

Least I'll be in another world
While you're pissing on my casket
How could you be
(oh-oh-ohh)

So perfect for me
(oh-oh-ohh)
Why can't you ignore
(oh-oh-ohh)

The things I did before
(oh-oh-ohh)
Somewhere along the way
exacting vengeance gave excitement

Somewhere along the way
that excitement turned to pleasure
Somewhere along the way
that pleasure turned to madness

Sooner or later that kind of madness turns into pain
And the ones that I made pay
were never the ones who deserved it
Those who helped me along the way
I smacked them as I thanked them
Yes I know I'm going to hell in a leather jacket

Least I'll be in another world
while you're pissing on my casket
And all that I can do
is sing a song of faded glory

And all you got to do
Sit there look pretty and make 'em horny
Together we sing songs and tell exaggerated stories
About the way we feel today and tonight and in the morning
How could you be
(oh-oh-ohh)
So perfect for me
(oh-oh-ohh)
Why can't you ignore
(oh-oh-ohh)
The things I did before
(oh-oh-ohh)
Take all your fears
pretend they're all true
Take all your plans
Pretend they fell through
But that's what it's like
(oh-oh-ohh)
That's what it's like for most
people in this world
the rich or the poor
(oh oh ohh)
Muslims or Jews
(oh-oh-ohh)
When roles are reversed
(oh-oh-ohh)
Opinions are too
(oh-oh-ohh)
That's all I'm gonna say now
before they come knockin' on my door now
