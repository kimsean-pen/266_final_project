Too cold, like ice to touch.
You hold on far to much.
God knows why we're in love.
When you throw your temper out of doors
that I cannot follow through
and yet... you grow ever near.

I promise I will not see out this night
without comforting and holding you.
Your eyes alight, they've never shined so bright
for just one second I'm lost in you.

I promise I will not see out this night
