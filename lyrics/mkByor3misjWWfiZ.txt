Tired, tired of it all
I'm so sick of routines slowing down
Close my eyes just a second
Doesn't seem to do a fucking thing
Open them for a moment
So glad I can see

I need a reason to leave my bed
Need an answer to open my eyes
Need hope to leave my head
'Cause I stay, stay in my mind

Threw me, threw my life away
I'm so sick, overwhelmed, leave me away
I can lie for nothing from everything
At the same time, I ask myself again

I need a reason to leave my bed
Need an answer to open my eyes
Need hope to leave my head
'Cause I stay, stay in my mind
Stay in my mind, stay in my mind
Stay in my mind

Bent and broken
Save my life for me
Bent and broken
Save my life for me

I need a reason to leave my bed
Need an answer to open my eyes
Need hope to leave my head
'Cause I stay, stay in my mind
Stay in my mind, stay in my mind
Stay in my mind

Stay in my mind, stay in my mind
Stay in my mind, stay in my mind
