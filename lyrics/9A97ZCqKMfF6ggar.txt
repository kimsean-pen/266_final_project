Like an Animal of Lust, A carnal Vision of undoing.
Over wounded Angel, perfect Huntress frozen inside.
Cut off the Head and the Body will fall.
The Eyes of Medusa turn you to Stone.

Build of Regret inside of my Heart.
So many Demons that tear me apart.

Build of Regret inside of my Heart.
So many Demons that tear me apart.

Build of Regret inside of my Heart.
So many Demons that tear me apart (souls are screaming)

Build of Regret inside of my Heart.
So many Demons that tear me apart (souls are screaming, scream alone)

Scream alone...

Spit out the Venom and watch as it flows.
Speak in the Tongues of Devils without Souls.
Hope for the Sunrise, then you will know.
The Future is written which Way will you go?

Build of Regret inside of my Heart.
So many Demons that tear me apart.

Build of Regret inside of my Heart.
So many Demons that tear me apart.

So many Demons that tear me apart (souls are screaming)

So many Demons that tear me apart (souls are screaming, scream alone)

All in Favour, meet your Maker, roll the Dice.
Bring the Pain in, own the Feeling, sacrifice.
Feel united, see the Life in Black and White.

Fallen in Danger, bring in the Anger, Fire and Ice (Fire and Ice)
Follow the Wreckage, know the Name of those alive (Of those alive)
Feel united, see the Life in Black and White.
