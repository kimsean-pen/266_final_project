Think you're pretty mean
Acting James Dean
I look real tough
But it ain't good enough
With your heart on your clothes
You try and act with your pose
But if I look in your eyes
You just run and hide

You can't
You can't fool me
You can't
You can't fool me

Now the actions begun
You ain't scarin' no one
Just back him up quick
You only make me feel sick
Just going home
Leave us alone
Go and beat up your cat
I bet you're I bet you're good at that

You can't
You can't fool me
You can't
You can't fool me

Now the actions begun
You ain't scarin' no one
Just back him up quick
You only make me feel sick
Just going home
Leave us alone
Go and beat up your cat
I bet you're I bet you're good at that

You can't
You can't fool me
You can't
You can't fool me
You can't
You can't fool me
You can't
You can't fool me
