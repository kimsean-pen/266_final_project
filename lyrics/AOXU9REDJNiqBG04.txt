You hang your hand out the car window
We travel by the roadway's hum

See the signs pass
Watch the fields go by
Every mailbox
Every streetlight

Right here with me: exist amongst the wheat
Amidst the leaves you watch listlessly
To the key of evergreen, I listen to the whisper

We'll climb the mountains before we meet the sea
The rain will stop eventually
I'll drive slow across black ice
and you'll be safe to rest your eyes

Soon enough the sun will go down but
It's no bother, I'm not tired
It's no bother
I'm not tired
I'm not tired

We'll climb the mountains before we meet the sea
The rain will stop eventually
I'll drive slow across black ice
and you'll be safe to rest your eyes

We'll climb the mountains before we meet the sea
The rain will stop eventually
I'll drive slow across black ice
and you'll be safe to rest your eyes
My lovely,
My lovely,
you'll be safe to rest your eyes
