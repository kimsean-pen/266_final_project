You talk about it all the time
But you don't do it– who!
You think about it all the time
But you never get to it– ah!

You know I wanna see you win, I wanna see you win
I wanna see within, I wanna be your win
I wanna be within, I want let you in
I wanna be your thing, don't wanna hear you
Talk about it all the time, and never get to it– who!

Look who you're dealing with I'm not your mother
I'm down for whatever, just say what you're after
Don't need a brother, I don't need a son
Tell me how you got so stunned

Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)
Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)
Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)
Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)

You say you wanna take control?
Well don't just say it– who!
You say you wanna change the game, but you just play it– ah!

You know I want to see you win, I want to see you win
I wanna see within, I wanna be your win
I wanna be within, I want let you in
I wanna be your thing, don't wanna hear you
Talk about it all the time, and never get to it– who!

Look I don't hold back you know who I am
I can't be with someone who won't take a stand
It's ok to need more, it's ok to run
But behind my back it's just scum

Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)
Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)
Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)
Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
You know I wanna see within, I wanna see within, I wanna see within, I wanna see within
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
You know I wanna let you in, I wanna let you in, I wanna let you in

Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)
Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)
Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)
Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)

Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)
Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)
Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)
Ya dumb fuck, ya dumb fuck (dumb fuck)
