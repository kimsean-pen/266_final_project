I'm a gonna dance with my princess
By the light of the magical moon
I'm a gonna dance with my princess
By the light of the ma-magical moon

As I go along my way, I say hey-hey
As I go along my way, I say hey-hey

I'm a gonna talk with the elders
And tell all of our hearts that she's good
I love ev'ry dance with my baby
By the light of the magical moon

As I go along my way, I say hey-hey
As I go along my way, I say hey-hey

I'm a gonna dance (d-dance) with my baby (b-baby)
By the light of a ma-magical moon
Gonna do-do-d-dance with my baby
By the light of the magical moon

When I slay the darkest day then we can play
Until that deep and joyous day we'll dance and pray
Alright
