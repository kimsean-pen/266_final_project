You said you wanted to feel
The gun in your hands
Aluminum and steel
Measure the man

And in the distance you see
A promised land
Gilded with fire and gold
We'll stick with the plan

'Cause is there something so wrong with wanting to run
Through the dead of the night with my hair on fire?
'Cause everyone does it
Everyone's got their eyes on the reason

You said you wanted to feel
The blood in your hands
I guess it's just my opinion
At least we know where we stand

Oh, but who is gonna believe you
Now that you're back
Into all the lies that we know?
Coz this wolf is down

'Cause is there something so wrong with wanting to run
Through the dead of the night with my pants on fire?
'Cause everyone does it
Everyone's got their own disillusion

You say you wanted to feel
(Fe fe fe fe fe fe fe fe feel)
(All better, all better)
(Did you feel it now)

'Cause is there something so wrong with wanting to run
Through the dead of the night with my pants on fire?
'Cause everyone does it
Everyone's got their own disillusion

You say you wanted to feel

'Cause is there something so wrong with wanting to run
Through the dead of the night with my pants on fire?
'Cause everyone does it
Everyone's got their own disillusion

You say you wanted to feel
