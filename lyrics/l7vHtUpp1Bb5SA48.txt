And they cry
And they call
As the wayward walk alone
City lights
Urban sprawl
In a place no one should know

Shown no grace
Shown no love
These mean streets are meant for none

Take them back to the start
Let the purest of heart
Know their worth is still spoken
As they fight to exist
We neglect and resist
Let this circle be broken

Broken homes
Broken lives
They repeat themselves in time
It's passed on
Down the line
Till we heal the wounds inside

It's not too late
To make things right
Dress the wounds with love's pure light

Take them back to the start
Let the purest of heart
Know their worth is still spoken
As they fight to exist
We neglect and resist
Let this circle be broken

They're still waiting
They still cry
They want to know they'll be all right
All I'm saying
Can we try?
To bring the wayward ones back home tonight
To bring the wayward ones back home tonight

Take them back to the start
Let the purest of heart
Know their worth is still spoken
As they fight to exist
We neglect and resist
Let this circle be broken
