Falling leaves and a golden glow
Lifts my heart and for all you know
At once

Made my escape just to see your face
Now I long so for your embrace
Never mind, I'm left behind
Something loud, a story told, a lie

Wanna dive in the river
Wanna swim in the water
Hold my breath with the feeling
Wanna swim in the water
Blow a kiss, can't you see me?
Call your name, don't you hear me?
Summer song lasts forever
Only when we're together

Dive
Dive

Dive

Make my escape just to see your face
Now I long so for your embrace
Never mind, I'm left behind
Softly mulled, a story told, a lie

Wanna dive in the river
Wanna swim in the water
Hold my breath with the feeling
Wanna swim in the water
Blow a kiss, can't you see me?
Call your name, can't you hear me?
Summer song lasts forever
Only when we're together

Wanna dive in the river
Wanna swim in the water
Hold my breath with the feeling
Wanna swim in the water
Blow a kiss, can't you see me?
Call your name, don't you hear me?
Summer song lasts forever
Only when we're together

Wanna dive in the river
Wanna swim in the water
Hold my breath with the feeling
Wanna swim in the water
Blow a kiss, can't you see me?
Call your name, don't you hear me?
Summer song lasts forever
Only when we're together

Wanna dive in the river
Wanna swim in the water
Hold my breath with the feeling
Wanna swim in the water
Blow a kiss, can't you see me?
Call your name, don't you hear me?
Summer song lasts forever
Only when we're together
