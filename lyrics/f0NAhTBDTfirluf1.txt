What's the sense in sharing this one and only life
Ending up just another lost and lonely wife
You'll count up the years and they will be filled up with tears

Love only breaks up to start over again
You'll get the babies but you won't have your man
While he's busy loving every woman that he can

Say I'm gonna leave a hundred times a day
It's easier said than done
When you just can't break away

Oh, young hearts run free
Never be hung up, hung up like my man be
Oh, young hearts to yourself be true
Don't be no fool, love really don't love you

I'm gonna love me for the rest of my days
Encourage the babies every time they say
Self preservation is what's really going on today

Say I'm gonna turn loose a thousand times a day
But how can I turn loos
When I just can't break away

Young hearts run free
Never be hung up, hung up like my man be
Oh, young hearts to yourself be true
Don't be no fool, love really don't love you
Oh, young hearts run free
Never be hung up, hung up like my man be
Oh, young hearts to yourself be true
Don't be no fool, love really don't love you
