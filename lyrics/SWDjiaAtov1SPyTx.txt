Well, I know about you
And I heard what you do, oh my God
Bleached thing, baby come on
(One more time!)

Well she don't like my electric guitar
And she says I took my jokes just a little too far
Well she wears her hair like the fourth of July
Rackets explode from behind my fly
Oh my God
Oh my God

Well, I know about you
And I heard just what you'll do
And I know it won't be long
Know it won't be long 'til I say
Bleached thang, come on
We should be gettin' it on
B-b-b-bleached thang, come o-o-on
We should be gettin' it on
Well, I know about you
And I heard what you do, oh my God
Bleached thang, baby come on
Come on, come on

Oh well, she's fake now, at least that's what they say
With puffed up plastic parts,
you know she wouldn't have it any other way
Well, she's got so many holes in her head
We spend most of our lives in bed, is it wrong?
Is that wrong?

Well, you know about me
And how boring I can be
You said it with a yawn
You said it with a yawn
Now I say
Bleached thang, come on
We should be gettin' it on
B-b-b-bleached thang, come o-o-on
We should be gettin' it on
Well, I know about you
And I heard what you do, oh my God
Bleached thang, baby come on

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Come on!
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Everybody
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Well, she flashes a smile like a paper tear
And you think she's worth your while
because she acts like she doesn't care
Well, she's as unique as a snowflake shape
So I'm gonna wait just as long as it takes 'til she's mine
'Til you're mine

This time I know it's real
So I keep my banana peeled
From morning until dawn
I know it won't be long 'til I say
Come on
We should be gettin' it on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
We should be gettin' it on
Bleached thang, come on
We should be gettin' it on
B-b-b-bleached thang, come o-o-on
We should be gettin' it on
Well, I know about you
And I heard what you do, oh my God
Bleached thang, baby come on

Bleached thang, come on (Come on, come on)
We should be gettin' it on (Bleached thang, baby come on)
Bleached thang, come on (Come on, come on)
We should be gettin' it on (Come on, come on)
Bleached thang, come on (Come on, come on)
We should be gettin' it on (Bleached thang, baby come on)
Bleached thang, come on (Come on, come on)
We should be gettin' it on
