I can make the rain stop
If I wanna just by my attitude
I can take my laptop
Record a snapshot
and change your point of view

I just entered this brand new world
And I'm so open hearted
I know I've got a long way to go
But I, I'm just getting stared

I'm Over My Head
And I know it, I know it
I'm doin' my best
Not to show it, to show it
Whatever it takes to be
What I was meant to be
I'm gonna try
'Cause I'm living the dream
And I know it, I know it
I'm tryin' my best
Not to blow it, to blow it
And I know everything will be fine
with me, myself and time

And time ...

I go where life takes me
But some days it makes me
Wanna change my direction
Sometimes it gets lonely
But I know that it's only
A matter of my perception

I just entered this brand new world
And I'm so open hearted
I know I've got a long way to go
But I'm, I'm just getting stared

I'm Over My Head
And I know it, I know it
I'm doin' my best
Not to show it, to show it
Whatever it takes to be
What I was meant to be
I'm gonna try
'Cause I'm living the dream
And I know it, I know it
I'm tryin' my best
Not to blow it, to blow it
And I know everything will be fine
with me, myself and time

And maybe there's nothing like this moment
So just be real and let the truth be spoken
Whatever's broke I can make it unbroken
Turn the lead in my hand
Into something golden
Just try, more love
If I just try, more love
Then I'll find myself in time

I'm Over My Head
And I know it, I know it
I'm doin' my best
Not to show it, to show it
Whatever it takes to be
What I was meant to be
I'm gonna try

I'm Over My Head
And I know it, I know it
I'm doin' my best
Not to show it, to show it
Whatever it takes to be
What I was meant to be
I'm gonna try
'Cause I'm living the dream
And I know it, I know it
I'm tryin' my best
Not to blow it, to blow it
And I know everything will be fine
with me, myself and time
