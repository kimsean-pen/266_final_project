Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in pull that pin
Fear thy name: Extermination
Desecrate inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the Crypt
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Deadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still
Fear thy name: Annihilation
Desolate inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the Crypt
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

My Apocalypse

Crushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body, mannequin
Spilling blood, bleeding gas

Mangled flesh, snapping spines
Dripping bloody valentine
shatter face, spitting glass

Split apart
Split apart
Split apart
Spit
Spit it out

What makes me drift a little bit closer
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over
Want to repeat until i feel

See through the skin the bones they all rattle
Future and past they disagree
Flesh falls away the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me
See the end in me

Claustrophobic
crawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in pull that pin

Violate annihilate
My Wounds unto my eyes
Obliterate exterminate
And life itself denied
Fear thy name as hell awakens
Destiny inhale the fire
So we've crossed that line
Into the Crypt
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse
Tyrant awaken my apocalypse
Demon awaken my apocalypse
Heaven awaken my apocalypse
Suffer forever my apocalypse
