When we finally get together
I wanna do it to music
And when I tear off your sweater
I wanna do it to music

And then when we storm the palace
We gotta do it to music
Aurora Borealis
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

When I wanna block out the world
I do it to music
Just a set of headphones and a girl
That's all there is to it

Life disappoints and hurts
Efforts often fall short
Melody is an elevator
Makes everything seem better

When we celebrate
Do it to music
Bake you a chocolate birthday cake
Do it to music
And when I clean up the empty room
I'm dancing with my broom

I disappointed you
And I hurt you too
Melody can be disarming
Will you forgive me
If I sing that I'm sorry

When I cry my face off
I do it to music
