They say you gotta make a change
If you wanna feel better
Now I'm pushing weight
Bursting out my favorite sweater
Fuck the opposition
I'm a smoke em in a second
Yeah I kill time that's the way
That I spend it
And I don't wanna die but my brain think different
Wanna feel fine but I act so distant
And I don't wanna doubt but my dreams fictitious
Not enough energy to break out the system
Wake up with the same mindset
My plate got to much to digest
Inspiration too rare to even find it
So I fight my way through the violence
Had the dream again
The one you're screaming in
The one I wake up
Still feelings deep within
I'm so sorry
I had to do that
I broke everything
The pieces wouldn't glue back

My mind insane
I can't erase
What I have lost
Embedded in my brain
Stuck up in ways
You told me I'm a waste
And I agree with that
I'm filling up the space
My mind insane
I can't erase
What I have lost
Embedded in my brain
Stuck up in ways
You told me i'm a waste
And I agree with that
I'm filling up the space

I'm just here filling up the space
I'm just here filling up the space

My vision 20/20
But my problems aren't clear to me
I'm seeking opportunities but
Fuck them up so frequently like
I can't stop it
I make myself nauseous
I turn a good girl to
A bitch that is toxic
I don't wanna always do that
Just wanna make you happy
If your moods bad
Not feeling too good
About the truth myself
But I gotta dust off
What's on my shelf

My mind insane
I can't erase
What I have lost
Embedded in my brain
Stuck up in ways
You told me I'm a waste
And I agree with that
I'm filling up the space
My mind insane
I can't erase
What I have lost
Embedded in my brain
Stuck up in ways
You told me i'm a waste
And I agree with that
I'm filling up the space

Filling up the space
I'm filling up the space
I'm filling up the space

My mind insane
I can't erase
What I have lost
Embedded in my brain
Stuck up in ways
You told me I'm a waste
And I agree with that
I'm filling up the space
