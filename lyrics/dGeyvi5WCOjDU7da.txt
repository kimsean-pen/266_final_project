Carry my head with this mangled body
It hurts like hell
Carry my head with this mangled body
It hurts like hell

The lights are on
There's nobody home
Lungs are lid
And heart is mould

Carry my head with this mangled body
It hurts like hell
Carry my head with this mangled body
It hurts like hell

Carry my head with this mangled body
It hurts like hell
Carry my head with this mangled body
It hurts like hell
