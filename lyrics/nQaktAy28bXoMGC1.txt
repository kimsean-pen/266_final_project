Everybody knows
The demons come and go
To have regrets is only human
But I just can't escape
The memories of mistakes
Round and round instead of moving on
Until the stars collide
Until the stars collide

Everybody knows
The demons come and go
To have regrets is only human
But I just can't escape
The memories of mistakes
Round and round instead of moving on
Until the stars collide
