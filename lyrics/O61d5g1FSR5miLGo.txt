Right at the core, you got me right at the core
It's the part of love and war
You shot me down
Straight to the heart
Right at the core, you feel the door
Into forever more, and more

At the core, got you at the core
You try to hate me, but your heart is still there
So much more, so much more, so much more
There in your core
Won't take it back, ease up for more
But your heart can't cool, can't cool, no

Deep down inside, you're be right the core
You try to fake, but you just can't go, no,
There's no hope, no

Right at the core, you got me right at the core
It's the part of love and war
You shot me down
Straight to the heart
Right at the core, you got me right at the core.
