Don't know what I'm doin' back in the studio
Gettin' greedy cause he said he had another sick flow
So I had to hollaback, guess I didn't get enough
Still feel the wonderland, Alice, and the tick tock
If you gimme a clap, I'm gonna give an encore
Don't want it to end, I want to skank some more
I'm trippin' on the best dream that I never had
I guess behind the orange curtain it's not so bad

From the west side, Anaheim, a small world after all
Hangin' at the hotel, selling make-up at the mall
Makin' out to Purple Rain, just like everybody else
Dame un beso, no stop, I'm trying to save myself
Ordinary common girl way back in the 7-1-4 days
Trying to figure out what I wanna be
Hangin' in the garage, me and N.D.

I'm just an Orange County Girl
Livin' in an extraordinary world
I'm just an Orange County Girl
Livin' in an extraordinary world
Sing - La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
And my girls sing - La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
And the guys sing - La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
And the girls sing - La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

A lot of things have changed, but I'm mostly the same
These are a few of my favorite things
Still rolling 'cause the sound of music
And nothing better than a great big huge hit
You know I'd pay you just to let me write, dance, and sing
I know I'm livin' the e-ticket dream
For a girl from OC it's almost undeard of
So I wanna thank you all so much for the love
Especially the girlfriends

Flew down to meet p, make a hurricane in Miami
Workin' with him, gonna get myself another Grammy
I got the L.A.M.B and he's rockin' the Ice Cream
Blend it together, something fresh and kinda in-between
Writing down my feelings is something that I love
So I don't really give a fuck
Music don't come in no color
It's time to move on, hit you with the chorus

I'm just an Orange County Girl
Livin' in an extraordinary world
I'm just an Orange County Girl
Livin' in an extraordinary world
Sing - La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
And my girls sing - La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
And the guys sing - La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
And the girls sing - La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

And the dream goes on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
And the dream goes on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
And the dream goes on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
And the dream goes on and on and on and on
On and on and, and the dream goes

I'm just an Orange County Girl
Livin' in an extraordinary world
I'm just an Orange County Girl
Livin' in an extraordinary world
Sing - La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
And my girls sing - La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
And the guys sing - La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
And the girls sing - La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
