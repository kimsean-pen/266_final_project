I know those eyes don't attest with
Pure devotion, so infested
I only woke to see you've rested and grown to weep
How could you leave me restless and broke?

Lay this heavy stone, my love
You didn't have to grieve like that
I know, I know, my love
I didn't want to leave like that

I know those lies show no rest when
Pure evoting falls like a necklace
I only hoped to see you've rested and grown to weep
How could you leave me restless and broke?

Lay this heavy stone, my love
You didn't have to grieve like that
I know, I know, my love
I didn't want to leave like that
Lay this heavy stone, my love
You didn't have to grieve like that
I know, I know, my love
I didn't want to leave like that
