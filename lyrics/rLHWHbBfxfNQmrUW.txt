Bring on salvation
I have a way to find mine
I swallow light
And what if I move
Lapsing into failure
In the lowering night
In the lowering night
I had waited for you
Though I was certain you wouldn't come back
No

Into the after hours

Smudged my heart for all to see
But it's so quiet now
Makes it harder to shine
Had a dream about tomorrow
But with nothing more to think about
I fade out

Bring on sedation
I have waited a long time
And dragged myself a long way
There's a flight to Medell√≠n
Twelve hours of drinking gin
Awakened by summer

Sever the ties
That were once unyielding
Packed my money
Under night's neon curtain

Smudged my heart for all to see
But it's so quiet now
Makes it harder to shine
Had a dream about tomorrow
But with nothing more to think about
I fade out
