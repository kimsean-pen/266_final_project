Get Away
Chvrches

I can only see you when I close my eyes
There's nothing left of you here
We had the time, we had the time
The things I do remember I do not regret
They don't mean a thing here
We had the time, we had the time

I'll be your guide
So you can see the other side
Then I will never let you get away
Never let you get away
I'll hold your hand
So you can see
Crossing your heart and hoping
To never let you get away
Never let you get away

Everything you prayed for is not overhead
No one else will save you
Wake you up your mind, wake up your mind
Trust me when I tell you, we are on our own
Overlap your fingers
And run through the pines, we'll run through the pines

I'll be your guide
So you can see the other side
Then I will never let you get away
Never let you get away
I'll hold your hand
So you can see
Crossing your heart and hoping
To never let you get away
Never let you get away

I'll be your guide
So you can see the other side
Then I will never let you get away
Never let you get away
I'll hold your hand
So you can see
Crossing your heart and hoping
To never let you get away
Never let you get away
Never let you get away
Never let you get away
Never let you get away
