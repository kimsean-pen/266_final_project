I found these days the things you say are so frustrating
Always asking where we're going
Release the handle bars, the wheels will start to roll
Who knows just what we'll find

What happens to you? What happens to me?
Who knows which way the wind will blow
Baby, it's a mystery
I don't know cause I can't see
There's no point even talking about
It's a mystery
But I can say without a doubt
I want you right now

When you look at me, I see you comtemplating
If I'm gonna break your heart
I'm twenty-four, I'm pretty sure I'll want you when you're eighty
But who wants to see that far?

What happens to you? What happens to me?
Who knows which way the wind will blow
Baby, it's a mystery
I don't know cause I can't see
There's no point even talking about
It's a mystery
But I can say without a doubt
I want you right now

It don't matter how much you try to scheme and plan
Too many things, my love, that are out of our hands

What happens to you? What happens to me?
Who knows which way the wind will blow
Baby, it's a mystery
I don't know cause I can't see
There's no point even talking about
It's a mystery
But I can say without a doubt
I want you right now

I want you right now
