(Make me)
Into the one you want, into the one you need you bend and
(Break me)
You watch me separate myself from who I really am
To fit into your plan

You're cutting me in two, ripping me in three
You're killing with those words you say to me
You're cutting me in two, ripping me in three
How many pieces can you take from me?
Take from me

(Take take take take take it)
Whatever's left is only following routine and
(Fake it)
And give in to the thoughts that being bought is what I am
To fit into your plan

You're cutting me in two, ripping me in three
You're killing with those words you say to me
You're cutting me in two, ripping me in three
How many pieces can you take from me?

The wheels they turn for you, a deity for two
Holding on it's true, won't bring it back again
The way you look my friend, it's closer to the end
I'm holding out a hand, to bring it back again

You cut me up again, cut me down
You cut me up again, cut me down
You cut me down

You're cutting me in two ripping me in three
You're killing with those words you say to me
You're cutting me in two ripping me in three
How many pieces can you take from me?
How many pieces can you take from me?
How many pieces can you take from me?
