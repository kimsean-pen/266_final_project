You said
A fool would say it's over
But instead
The voice in my head was right

No more letting you down or messing around
All over the place, I'm just saying
You can be certain, you can move on
And you'll find someone, yeah, I'm praying
She'll be better than me, I know I'll be pleased
I promise you that I'm not fake
Yeah, I know I'll see that setting you free was not a mistake

Don't look over your shoulder
Just keep walking away
We can breathe now, it's over
And erase all the pain

I bet
You smile just a little longer
So glad we made it (so glad we made it, so glad)
The voice in my head was right

She'll be better than me, I know I'll be pleased
I promise you that I'm not fake
Yeah, I know I'll see that setting you free was not a mistake

Don't look over your shoulder
Just keep walking away
We can breathe now, it's over
And erase all the pain

I know she'll be better, you'll see
Don't worry about me, babe
I'm sure she'll be all that you need
Don't worry about me, honey
You know you'll be good without me
Don't worry 'bout me, babe

You left me tied up
We're not better together
She'll change you better

Don't look over your shoulder
Just keep walking away
We can breathe now, it's over
And erase all the pain
