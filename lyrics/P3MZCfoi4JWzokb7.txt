Well, I was looking at a movie on the TV last night
Then I had a very funny notion, yeah
I really had to write a song about it
And then I'm gonna sing it with my rock'n roll band

And I bet that people gonna like it, yeah
I know that everybody's gonna shout it
About a dreadful, mighty killer
A big, black, wild gorilla

(We do the)
King Kong song
Won't you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong

(We do the)
King Kong song
Gotta sing along
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom?
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song

Now we can make the jungle out of any old place
We can make gorillas out of people, yeah
Well, who can tell a monkey from a monkey
So people get together gonna have a good time

Everybody listen to the music, yeah
The song we're gonna sing is kinda funky
So let your arms hang down and waddle all around
Like a dreadful, mighty killer
A big, black, wild gorilla

(We do the)
King Kong song
Won't you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong

(We do the)
King Kong song
Gotta sing along
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom?
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song

Like a dreadful, mighty killer
A big, black, wild gorilla

(We do the)
King Kong song
Won't you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong

(We do the)
King Kong song
Gotta sing along
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song
