The donkey roll was the shit, that's the reason why I dance

We are the Style Boyz, we came to party
So get on the floor and move your body
Look into the wind and lose control
Don't be a MILF and just (let me see that donkey roll)

Donkey roll
Let me see that donkey roll
Donkey roll
Let me see that donkey roll

Flap your arms like a bird flying around
Then point your fingers at the cold dead ground
Make like a dude on a Egyptian scroll
Don't be a MILF and just (let me see that donkey roll)

Donkey roll
Let me see that donkey roll
Donkey roll
Let me see that donkey roll

Donkey roll, donkey roll
