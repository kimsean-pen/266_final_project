"On this glorious day... I declare Gaius Augustus Germanicus, Emperor of Rome!"
I, Caligvla am god made flesh, thy rope around your neck... this is the will of the gods! I, Caligvla am master of all your fears, thy might colossal, these hands are drenched in blood!
Bow to me, you worthless swine... the sky will fall from grace All these voices left on unheard, dead and buried in my dominion
Whisper... Whisper... whisper words of domination
I am life, I am death, your souls left to waste I am everything you need and all the things you fear
Whisper... Whisper... whisper words of insanity
They killed my mother, they killed my father... who am I but the true face of ROME
Traitors shall be crucified, their women and children thrown from the Tarpeian rock
I thirst your blood, I want it all!!
I, Caligvla am god made flesh, thy rope around your neck... this is the will of the gods! I, Caligvla am master of all your fears, thy might colossal, these hands are drenched in blood
Kneel... Kneel... Kneel... before for me
Kneel... Kneel... Kneel... for I am god!
