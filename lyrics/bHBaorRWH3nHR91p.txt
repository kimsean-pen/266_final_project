Saw you staring into nothing
In the silence something's screaming
I know you're trying but there's nothing you can say

I feel better in the morning
When all my troubles lose their meaning
Let go, there's nothing you can change

I know it hurts to watch me bleeding
Can't tell you what I'm needing
We can't stop the river rising

I got a heavy heart
Too much for you to hold
We always come apart
And then I treat you so cold

We can pretend there's nothing wrong but
I was telling you it's not your fault
You wanna help but it's helpless every time

We're bittersweet in the sunlight
We can't believe every story we're sold
There's truth in the darkness we find

I know it hurts to watch me bleeding
Can't tell you what I'm needing
We can't stop the river rising

I got a heavy heart
Too much for you to hold
We always come apart
And I treat you so cold

The chemicals that we are breathing
Lock you out and I keep looking in
I am running out of reasons
Don't help myself by looking in

And I'm standing in the way
And I'm standing in the way

I got a heavy heart
Too much for you to hold
We always come apart
And I then I treat you so cold
I treat you so cold
