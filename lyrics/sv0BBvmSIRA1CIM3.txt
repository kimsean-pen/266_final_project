I wake up in the morning and it's 6 a clock.
They say there may be rain but the sun is hot.
I wish I had some just to kill today,
And I wish I had a dime for every bill I got to pay.
Some days you lose you win and the waters as high as the times your in.
So I jump back into where I learned to swim.
Try to keep my head above it as best I can.
That's why;
Here I am,
Just waiting for this storm to pass me by.
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down
and that's the sound of sunshine coming down...
I saw my friend Bobby he said "What's up man?"
You gotta little work or a twenty to lend?
I opened up my hand
He said I'm glad to see, they can take away my job but not my friends you see.
And here I am just waiting for this storm to pass me by.
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down
I want to go where the sun will never end
With my guitar on the beach there with all my friends.
The sun so hot and the waves in motion and everything smells like suntan lotion, the ocean, and the girls so sweet
So kick of your shoes and relax your feet
They say that miracles are never ceasin', and every single soul needs a little realeasin'
the stereo bumpin till the sun goes down, and I only want to hear that sound
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down
And now say
You're the one I want to be with, when the sun goes down.
You're the one I want to be with, when the sun goes down
Sing;
You're the one I want to be with when the sun goes down.
You're the one I want to be with when the sun goes
That's the sound of sunshine coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down
