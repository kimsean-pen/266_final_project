Sat there on the dock with both my feet grazing the water
I could taste the island beaches on my tongue
Splashes on the rocks got me imagining the palm trees
And the shorelines spotted up with coconuts

Tidal waves and hurricanes
Broken anchors, crashing planes
Keep washing me up on your sand
Take my hand

I wanna be stranded on this island with you, ooh, ooh
I wanna be stranded on this island for two, ooh, ooh
And I hope it's somewhere far where only we are
Stranded on your heart

Spend my free time thinking
How your tears aren't made for drinking
But I'm thirsty for what you keeping inside
Losing track of time
What seems like weeks is only hours
I can't wait until that moment when you're mine

Even though we're not the same
Different in every way
I can't help but smile when you say
Take my hand

I wanna be stranded on this island with you, ooh, ooh
I wanna be stranded on this island for two, ooh, ooh
And I hope it's somewhere far where only we are
Stranded on your heart

I won't call SOS, no message in a bottle
No signaling with smoke, I'm trying to get home
If I can't be with you I'd rather be alone

I wanna be stranded on this island with you, ooh, ooh
I wanna be stranded on this island for two, ooh, ooh
And I hope it's somewhere far where only we are
Stranded on your heart, oh, oh, oh

And I hope it's somewhere far where only we are
Stranded on your heart
And I hope it's somewhere far where only we are
Stranded on your heart

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
