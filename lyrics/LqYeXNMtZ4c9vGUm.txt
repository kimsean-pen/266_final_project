Help! I need somebody
Help! Not just anybody
Help! You know I need someone

Help!

(When) When I was younger
So much younger than today

(I never needed) I never needed anybody's Help in any way
(Now) But now these days are gone
(These days are gone), I'm not so self assured
(I know I've found) Now I find I've changed my mind

And opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground

Won't you please, please Help me?
(Now) And now my life has changed in, Oh, so many ways
(My independence) My independence seems to vanish in the haze
(But) But every now (Every now and then) and then I feel so insecure

(I know that I) I know that I just need you like
I've never done before
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please Help me?

When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's Help in any way
(Now) But now these days are gone
(These days are gone), I'm not so self assured
(I know I've found) Now I find I've changed my mind
And opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please Help me?
Help me! Help me! Ooh
