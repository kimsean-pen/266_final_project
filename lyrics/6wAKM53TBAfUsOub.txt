Hey
I know I just saw you yesterday, but I wanted to say
That I miss you and I am sorry I always have to go
Every couple weeks or so
And I'm sick of the roads
And the tolls that we both have to pay, 'cause I'm always away

I miss the smell of your skin and your clothes
And I want nothing more than to be back at home again
Staying in, getting takeout, or binge-watching HLN
I haven't slept well in days
I miss waking up, having coffee and breakfast in bed
Sharing showers, and I quit smoking cigarettes
Until I left for tour, but I'm anxious again
While you're in bed back home, and I'm a total wreck
I'm still a total wreck
I'm still a total wreck
(Fuck!)

I tried to sit still
Made the call and now I'm talking to a voicemail
Left a message
Pay attention to the detail
Overwrought and overwhelmed
Hear me shaking as I exhale
Quivering and sweating out the chemicals
11 hour acid trip when Scott became a ceiling fan, and I am soap
So here I go, carry on alone
So here I go, carry on alone
I carry on alone

I miss the smell of your skin and your clothes
And I want nothing more than to be back at home again
Staying in, getting takeout, or binge-watching HLN
I haven't slept well in days
I miss waking up, having coffee and breakfast in bed
Sharing showers, and I quit smoking cigarettes
Until I left for tour, but I'm anxious again
While you're in bed back home, and I'm a total wreck
I'm still a total wreck
