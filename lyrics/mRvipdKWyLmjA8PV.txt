Under the cool, grey water
Voices we back on a long
Need to change that filter
Where those old leaves blown from
Closing the pile by the pool house
Watching the glass by your shoes
I can't swim in the blue

You never mentioned leaving
Just spin up the speaking with your voice
A little place tomorrow staring at the sea
But I'm still tryina stop your shadows
Slip back down the hallway
Like a chain that I can't count
[?] same as always, always seem too much
Wait to run till the rain comes down
Never get home if you don't strike out
I loved you like you never know
Where did all those futures gone?

As long as the snow keeps falling
I'm in a rush to get back
Till I find my own temple
Said he never waits up
Time to keep warm in this raincoat
Couple of books in my back
Threw a coin the fountain
[?] for the splash
I never saw you leaving,
But I know you have some good gives with your bad
Up on your own tomorrow staring at the sea
But I'm still tryina stop your shadows
Slip back down the hallway
Like a chain that I can't count
[?] same as always, always seem too much
Wait to run till the rain comes down
Never get home if you don't strike out
I loved you like you never know
Where did all those futures gone?

Wait to run till the rain comes down
Never get home if you don't strike out
I loved you like you never know
Where did all those futures gone?
