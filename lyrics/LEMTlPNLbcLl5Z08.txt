There is an empire in the boundaries of Hell
Where only the Death can reach and only the demons reign
Place of lust, blasphemy and eternal darkness
Where the ritual sacrifices are offered to the master

Illusions of the darkness
Power of death
Strength of Hell
Empire of the damned

On the black hills of Megiddo you'll find
A place so cold as the mist, so dark as the night
Black armies march to the hills
To make the power of the reign of darkness grow

The exterminating angel
Here there's to be emperor
To command Nosferatu
Creature of crypts

From the eternal darkness
A blade will shine
Saints and Gods will judged
Killed and buried

One day this empire will be discovered
For the judgement of mankind
Gnash of teeth and endless cries will be heard
The Hell there is to bury the Heaven, there is to dethrone
