Come to me now
I wanna be your best friend for all of time
I wanna be the tissue for your tears
I never wanna be alone

I never, never, never, really thought that I could feel
A feeling that awakened me so
I was astray of knowing where I belong
Living out of time, living out of time

Oh, now that you've come and set me free
Now that I know what love can be
All that I want is you with me
That's all I want

You allow, allow, allow, allow, allow
Allow me to be what I wanna be
Thanks for helping me

I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, I'm gonnabe
And feel like a bright shining star
For only you to see, for only you to see

Now that you've come and set me free
Now that I know what love can be
All that I want is you with me
That's all I want

Hold me tight, hold me tight
I won't let you go
Close to you, close to you
Touch me, don't let go, give me all your love

Close to you, oh, oh, close to you, close to you
Give me all your love
All that I want
Is you to be with me
