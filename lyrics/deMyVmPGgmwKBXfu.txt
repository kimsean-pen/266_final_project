That's all I wanted
Something special something sacred in your eyes
For just one moment to be bold and naked at your side
Sometimes I think that you never understand me (understand me)
Maybe this time is forever say it can be
W-h-o-a...
That's all you wanted
Something special someone sacred in your life
Just for one moment to be warm and naked at my side

Sometimes I think that you never understand me (understand me)
But something tells me together we'd be happy
W-h-o-a baby
I will be your father figure
Oh baby

Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Be your daddy
Anything you have in mind

I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
Except me
I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time
Do it do it do it do it oh baby
That's all I wanted
But sometimes love can be mistaken for a crime
That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's blue eyes shine
This time I think that my lover understands me
(understands me)
If we have faith in each other then we can be strong baby
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
My baby

I will be your preacher teacher

Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time
If you are the desert I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger hunger for me
Whatever you ask for that's what I'll be
So when you remember the ones who have lied

Who said that they cared but then laughed as you cried

Beautiful darling don't think of me...
Because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes baby-baby-baby
And love can't lie no
Greet me with the eyes of a child
My love is always telling me so
(heaven is a kiss and a smile)
Just hold on hold on
Won't let you go my baby
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mine baby
I will be your father figure

I have had enough of crime

So I am gonna love you 'til the end of time
I will be your father
I will be your...
I will be your preacher
(I'll be your daddy)
I'll be your daddy
W-h-o-a
I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time...
