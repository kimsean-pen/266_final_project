Doncamatic
Down lowly

Make up for the time you wasted
Come slowly
And claim back boy you left behind
Close the white book

unplug the brain from the game
Cause it's time to wipe out
till the stars get on the fame
The song is not the same when we're all

played out, played out, all played out
They said the member is all
played out, played out, all played out
tell me did you feel that?
Don't slow down

even if it's only to escape
Just down, low down
Before somebody steals the place
Close the white book

unplug the brain from the game
'Cause it's time to wipe out
till the stars get on the fame
And the conversation's over
We're all played out, played out, all played out

(talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
You see the member is all played out
played out, all played out
(talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
Tell me did you feel that?
(Doncamatic)

Down lowly

Make up for the time you wasted
Come slowly
Claim back the boy you left behind and
Close the white book
Unplug the brain from the game
it's time to wipe out till the bar get on the fame
The song is not the same when we're

all played out, played out, all played out
(talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
You see the member is all played out
played out, all played out
(Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
The song is not the same when we're all
played out, played out, played tonight
(Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
The song is not the same when we're all played out
played out, played out, played out, played out
(Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
tell me did you feel that?
