Wait for a minute
Monday I wake up with disgust in my head
Could not forgive myself another moment spent in the bed
Monday the mirror always disappoints
I pinch my skin until I see the joints
Today I'm feeling like I live on the ledge
At any moment I just know I'm gonna fall off the edge
They say, "Hang on"
I promised them I will but I don't know for how long
Wait for a minute
I wait for a minute
I wait for a minute
I wait for a minute
I wait
Why do I spend the sole of my day
Looking for any way to waste away?
The pain is in the empty time
Just twiddling my thumbs and hoping for the words to write
Today I couldn't stand to be all alone
And sick of hearing my voice on the telephone
A thousand roads to injury
Most of them so smooth it doesn't feel like theyre hurting me
Wait for a minute
I wait for a minute
I wait for a minute
I wait for a minute
I wait
Oh, I'm still trying to leave the high violence behind
I wait for relief but the illness is my mind
Why should I worry? I'm already too late
Why should I wait?
Not knowing what the future will bring
Is always wrecking my day
I guess I'll drown my fear and seal my fate
A haze of cravings, easier to do it then it is to just sit here and wait
Easier to do it then it is to just sit here and wait
Wait for a minute
I wait for a minute
I wait for a minute
I wait for a minute
I wait
Easier to do it then it is to just sit here and wait
