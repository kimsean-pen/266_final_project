Don't wanna wait 'til tomorrow
Why put it off another day?
One by one, little problems
Build up, and stand in our way, oh!

One step ahead, one step behind it
Now you gotta run to get even
Make future plans I'll dream about yesterday, hey!
Come on turn, turn this thing around

(Right now)
Hey! It's your tomorrow
(Right now)
Come on, it's everything
(Right now)
Catch your magic moment
Do it right here and now
It means everything

Miss a beat, you lose the rhythm
And nothin' falls into place, aah
Only missed by a fraction
Slipped a little off your pace, oh!

The more things you get, the more you want
Just trade in one for another
Workin' so hard to make it easy
Whoa, got to turn, come on, turn this thing around

(Right now)
Hey! It's your tomorrow
(Right now)
Come on, it's everything
(Right now)
Catch that magic moment
Do it right here and now
It means everything

It's enlightened me
Right now
What are you waitin' for?
Ohh, yeah
Right now

(Right now)
Hey! It's your tomorrow
(Right now)
Come on, it's everything
(Right now)
Catch that magic moment
And do it right
(Right now)
Ohh, right now
It's what's happening
Right here and now
Right now, it's right now
Ohh
Tell me, what are you waitin' for?
Turn this thing around
