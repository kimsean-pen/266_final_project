It's getting hard to breathe
Darkness in my head frightens me
There's a little devil in my mouth
Writing ugly words for you to shout
The virgin soul that lived in me
Is raped by insecurity
I need you to sing

Sing for me my love
Sing the right from wrong
Here inside my mind
Truth is hard to find

It's getting too crowded here
All alone and playing with my fear
I don't want this anymore
I've tied myself down to the floor
I need you to sing

Sing for me my love
Sing the right from wrong
Here inside my mind
Truth is hard to find

SONO MIHI
Sing for me

Sing for me my love
Sing...

Sing for me my love
Sing the right from wrong
Here inside my mind
Truth is hard to find
