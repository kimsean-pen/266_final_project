I was booked for a wedding on the coast of Finist√®re
After the rehearsal I took a walk down to the harbor
They say, "This is where the world ends"
Or maybe where it's beginning
Out on the pier sat the bride on the rail smoking
I wasn't sure if she wanted to talk
But she nodded and waved me in
Her eyes were on the horizon
I asked how she was feeling

She said, "Like a five-year-old watching the ten-year-olds shoplifting
Ten-year-old watching the fifteen-year-olds French kissing
Fifteen-year-old watching the twenty-year-olds chain-smoking
Twenty-year-old watching the thirty-year-olds vanishing"

Is this where the world ends?
Or is it where it's beginning?
You open one door to find all the other doors closing
I said, "Marry and regret it
Don't marry, regret it too
Whether you marry or you don't
Either way you'll wish you hadn't

We laughed and she dried a tear
We walked back to the town front
And later that night I sang "You Are the Light"
We all danced and got drunk

I felt like a five-year-old watching the ten-year-olds shoplifting
Ten-year-old watching the fifteen-year-olds French kissing
Fifteen-year-old watching the twenty-year-olds chain-smoking
Twenty-year-old watching the thirty-year-olds vanishing

Oh, please, distract me
From every life unlived
Every path I haven't taken
The heart's still a little kid

A scared little five-year-old watching the ten-year-olds shoplifting
Ten-year-old watching the fifteen-year-olds French kissing
Fifteen-year-old watching the twenty-year-olds chain-smoking
Twenty-year-old watching the thirty-year-olds

Five-year-old watching the ten-year-olds shoplifting
Ten-year-old watching the fifteen-year-olds French kissing
Fifteen-year-old watching the twenty-year-olds chain-smoking
Twenty-year-old watching the thirty-year-olds vanishing
