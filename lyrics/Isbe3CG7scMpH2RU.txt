0505, you know
Trying to find the time
And you
You put me in a place somewhere between here
There and the true and living

Try not to think about the past
Second to none I'm trying to
Make sense it is
I feel the way i feel about you is still
See the past for what it was

Just tell me
A part of me hookup, a part off is l up
Away from you
I wish it meant as much to me as it used to be
Honestly
Does that make sense to you
That's what you said to me, so
Honestly, somewhere between trust and honesty
Out there somewhere between yourself
And the true and living
Rise up
