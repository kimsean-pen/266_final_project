In this house the decor's the obvious obscure
It's clearly the theory of less is more
A plant, a pet and books on the shelf
And a frame on the wall where you can picture yourselves

And you're welcome to stay
But even your company must complement the Feng Shui
Even down to what I have on
They do wonder to what extents I have gone

Tailored and tapered couture to the curb
Demanding the attention that it does deserve
Fabrics for the forecast of the day
I admit it, everything is fitted to fall in Feng Shui

More importantly the way that I move
If I'm in your town, my needle's down on the groove
On site they know my song
It ain't slow and it sho' ain't long

You see I do not play
Forgive me Father, I was forced out of Feng Shui
A flow as subtle as a summer breeze
Like the whispering winds and the talking trees

Too big to be boxed in, it bobs and weaves
It evolves, it solves, it gives and receives
And everything I say is calculated appropriated
Written and arranged in Feng Shui
