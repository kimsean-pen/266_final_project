Go down in history

Will I ever know what it's called when I see it
Will I feel like it's there when I call
Will I crawl to the end of everything that I've ever known
Just to prove I can conquer it all

But still I know that I am just what you needed
Count to ten but still I'm defeated
Every time that you turn to go

And still, I had in every word that you mutter
Bite the tongue and choke out the stutter
Every time that you say "hello"

Time rolls on, still I feel like it's already gone

It's never too late to keep your head straight
Move your hands back and forth in perfect symmetry
So you can live like a time bomb that doesn't have long
Go down in history

Is there anyone out there?
Or am I doing this on my own?

This time, we're gonna' take the world on, bracing for impact
Cross my fingers, hope and believe that
You'll be right by my side

Time rolls on, now I feel like it's taking way too long

It's never too late to keep your head straight
Move your hands back and forth and prove it's symmetry
So you can live like a time bomb that doesn't have long
Go down in history

I know my days are numbered, so I'm making them count
I've left those minutes behind me without a second of doubt
It's never too late to keep your head straight
Move your hands back and forth and prove it's symmetry
So you can live like a time bomb that doesn't have long
Go down in history
It's never too late to keep your head straight
Move your hands back and forth and prove it's symmetry
So you can live like a time bomb that doesn't have long
Go down in history
