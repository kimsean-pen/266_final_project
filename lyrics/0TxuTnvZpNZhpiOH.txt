What a day, that I've left behind
You forgave, said, "I've done my time"
I've been good, animation rhyme
Sisterhood, can I find that line?

Not anymore, I don't feel it
I'm not hopeless, tragic
No, nothing, no more to say
I've got freedom, no more calling

I don't care
I'll walk away
'Cause I've got confidence for quiet
I'm not afraid

I'm not hungry, no I'm over fed
Satisfied, with the life I've led
Movin' on, to where you can't see
What is me?
Well it's just for me

Mine end of the line
You don't hear it crashing silent
You're all gone, gone left me behind
Is this freedom no one's calling

I don't care
I'll walk away
'Cause I've got confidence for quiet
I'm not afraid

No, nothing, no more to say
Is this freedom, no one calling
I don't care

I don't care
I'll walk away
'Cause I've got confidence for quiet
I'm not afraid

No, I don't care
I'll walk away
'Cause I've got confidence for quiet
I'm not afraid

I've got confidence
I'm not afraid
