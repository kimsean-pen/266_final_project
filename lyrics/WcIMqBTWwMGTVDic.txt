ive been so wrapped up
in my warm cocoon
something's happening
things are changing soon

im pushing the edge
feeling it crack
and once i get out
there's no turning back

watching the butterfly
go towards the sun
i wonder what i will become

metamorphosis
whatever this is
whatever im going through
come on and give me a kiss
come on, i insist
i'll be something new
a metamorphosis

things are different now
when i walk by
you start to sweat
and you dont know why

it gets me nervous
but it makes me calm
to see life all around me
moving on

watching the butterfly
go towards the sun
i wonder what i will become

metamorphosis
whatever this is
whatever im going through
come on and give me a kiss
come on, i insist
i'll be something new
a metamorphosis

metamorphosis
whatever this is
whatever im going through
come on and give me a kiss
come on i inisist
i feel something new
metamorphosis

Spoken:
everyday is a transformation
everyday is a new sensation
alteration
modification
an incarnation
celebration

everyday is a new equation
everyday is a revelation
information
anticipaction
on to another
destination

metamorphosis
whatever this is
whatever im going through
come on and give me a kiss
come on, i insist
i'll be something new
a metamorphosis

(Repeat until end of song)
