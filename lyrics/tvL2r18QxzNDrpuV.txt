What you got is what you make it
What you got
What you got is what you make it
What you got is what you make it

Totally fried, totally cooked
Totally fried and fucked up
Been fourteen days and there's been no let up
And there's no one here to pull my plug

Now I'm gonna stop when I'm on my back
I'm gonna stop when I collapse
Oh, inside feels like a maze
Outside, it's all a haze

Man, I'm a greedy mess
Must be those feeders
Said I'm gonna clean up
Man, gotta clean up

What you got is what you make it
What you got is what you make it
What we have never seems to be enough
You just gotta learn to fake it

So I jump on a plane and I crash a car
And I try to sleep with all the stars
And all the other fakers were spick and span
They came with their own insurance plans

Well, I'm gonna stop when I'm on my back
I'm gonna stop when I collapse
Been twenty-one days and there's been no let up
And there's no home I can call my own

Ah, greedy mess, must be the feeders
Said I'm gonna clean up
Man, gotta clean up

What you got is what you make it
What you got is what you make it
You can sit down, you can beat yourself up
But you know what you should be thinking?

What you got is what you make it
What you got is what you make it
And what we have is what we make it
You just gotta learn to fake it

(What you got is what you make it) Come on, come on, come on
(What you got is what you make it) Come on, come on, come on, come on
(What you got is what you make it)
You just gotta learn to fake it
