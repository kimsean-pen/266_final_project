When, at last, the knife broke
And the rat decided to cut the rope
O, the child lived on
While the jailer dropped
Searching for old light in the dark

From time to time
Blushing orchid hues will come to mind
And a knock will greet
When I least expect
What I stopped trying to protect

Am I foolish or
Isn't there something more?

Heed the fleeting gales
Light which illuminates can burn
When you call my name
Could there be something left to learn?

Wading blindly
Into the night, I saw
What I wanted to

If we cut to the chase
What will I have kept? What will I have erased
From the screens that bridged
And still bring me to
Seeking or discovering old truths?

Am I foolish or
Wasn't there something more?

Heed the patterned trails
That leave us with messages to discern
Parting from the dark
Can't guarantee I won't return

Waiting blindly
All throughout the night
I felt her
Hold a hand for me to shake
And opened up my eyes
