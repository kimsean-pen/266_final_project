I start thinking, over thinking
Maybe I'm a mess
You're incisions, indecisions
Leave me so depressed

All your little paper cuts don't cut deep enough
Push the knife deeper, show me that you mean it
Paper cuts ain't really doing much
Stab me in the heart, babe

Imagine that you feel like I do
All the tables turned
Gasoline dipping, matched your skin, lit it
But it didn't burn

All your little paper cuts don't cut deep enough
Push the knife deeper, show me that you mean it
Paper cuts ain't really doing much
Stab me in the heart, babe

I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you

(Cut paper, rock, scissor
Scissor, paper, heart breaker
Cut paper, rock, scissor
Scissor, paper, heart breaker)
