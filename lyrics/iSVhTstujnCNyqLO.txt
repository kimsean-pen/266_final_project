Take me home

You, you hit with me a break
And now you're back for more
Your song's the same, leave me with all the blame
I don't have time for another game

I don't wanna dance, so don't you ask me, babe
I don't wanna dance
You blew your chance
To rock my night away

I want some fun
Boy, you're so not the one
I don't wanna dance, so let it go
You'll never take me home
Take me home
Take me home

Talk to me without a sound 'cause you were such a tool
Who's sorry now?
You, you're shaking on the floor
Watch me walking out the door

I don't wanna dance, so don't you ask me, babe
I don't wanna dance
You blew your chance
To rock my night away

I want some fun
Boy, you're so not the one
I don't wanna dance, so let it go
You'll never take me home
Take me home
Take me home

Don't tell the DJ to hit rewind
Tonight, there's no you and me
Don't play that record
Don't waste your time

You, you threw it all away

I don't wanna dance, so don't you ask me, babe
I don't wanna dance
You blew your chance
To rock my night away

I want some fun
Boy, you're so not the one
I don't wanna dance, so let it go
You'll never take me home
Take me home
Take me home

I won't dance, I won't dance
Bust a move or clap my hands
Bust a move or clap my hands
Bust a move or clap my hands

Take me home
(Take me home)
