In the night, in the light of the day.
Between the night, in the light of the day.
Between the night, in the light of the day.
Between the night, in the light of the day.

In between the night, and the light of the day.
Between the night, and the light of the day.
Between the night, and the light of the day.
I'm better off in the shade.

My hair, touch you up, and I feel
Behind a disguise.
My thoughts are lies.

Can't talk 'cause my lips are sealed.
I'll never be heard, if I'm not sayin' a word.
Though now, no explanation will ever do.
No special location fit for the truth.
Can't talk 'cause my lips are sealed.
My hair, touch you up, and I feel.

Between the night and the light of the day
I'm better off, better off in
Between the night and the light of the day
I'm better off in the shade.

Between the night and the light of the day
I'm better off, better off in
Between the night and the light of the day
I'm better off in the shade.

Lock myself inside, nothing else
There's nobody there, to hear my prayers
Standin' naked, still I'm fully drab

Covered by fear, let it all show and cheer
Running out of reasons to try
Beckoning to see, I'm way up high
It's all in my head, it's in my mind
Never look for anyone else to find.

Between the night and the light of the day
I'm better off, better off in
Between the night and the light of the day
I'm better off in the shade.

Between the night and the light of the day
I'm better off, better off in
Between the night and the light of the day
I'm better off in the shade.

Better off
Better off
Better off
I'm better off in the shade

Better off
Better off
Better off
I'm better off in the shade.
