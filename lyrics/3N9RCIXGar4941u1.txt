You're trying to show it all off
You're like a big shot, so what?
Please understand I don't care
I'm not a money lover
You work the room with big talk
I'm on my phone like "Oh, God"
Please understand I don't care
I'm not a money lover

I don't care about your daddy's yacht
Yeah, I guess I know it's worth a lot

You're trying to show it all off
You're like a big shot, so what?
Please understand I don't care
I'm not a money lover

Oh, you're talking but have nothing to say
You're driving me crazy, won't even say maybe
Oh, your pictures from St. Barts seem okay
You're boring me baby, stop making it rain
With your money bag, money bag
Flaunt it 'cause it's all you have
(It's all you have)
Oh, your money bag, money bag
Flaunt it and you'll be a man
(You'll be a man)

You're trying to show it all off
You're like a big shot, so what?
Please understand I don't care
I'm not a money lover

You work the room with big talk
I'm on my phone like "Oh, God"
Please understand I don't care
I'm not a money lover
