You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round my door
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round my door
You can wag your tail
But I ain't gonna feed you no more
You told me you was high class
But I could see through that
Yes, you told me you was high class
But I could see through that
And daddy I know
You ain't no real cool cat

You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round my door
You're just an old hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round my door
You can wag your tail

But I ain't gonna feed you no more

Oh play it play it boys
Ah listen to that old hound dog
Ah play it, it's all right up there
Let's let that old hound dog howl

Ah play it boys play it
Ah it makes you feel good
Ah do mess around I love ya
Now wag your tail
Ah get em
Ah get em now get em get em get em
Ah you're an old hound dog

You made me feel so blue
You made me weep and moan
You made me feel so blue
Well you made me weep and moan
'Cause you ain't looking for a woman
All you're lookin' for is a home
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round my door
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round my door
You can wag your tail
But I ain't gonna feed you no more
Howl
