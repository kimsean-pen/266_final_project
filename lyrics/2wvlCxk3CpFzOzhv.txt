There's not much to say for me
That's okay you know that girls like mystery
They'll know all the things I've read
That's ok don't necessarily make it bad

Leave me alone
I'm just your enemy
I've seen it all
I've seen your jealousy

They say love me till then end
They only see me as a friend
You leave a lot to be desired
I don't care if I'm desired

They say love me till then end
They only see me as a friend
You leave a lot to be desired
I never wanna be desired

There's not much to say for me
That's okay you know that girls like mystery
Keep your clothes as your dignity
After all it's only two years history

Leave me alone
I'm just your enemy
I've seen it all
I've seen your jealousy

They say love me till then end
They only see me as a friend
You leave a lot to be desired
I don't care if I'm desired

They say love me till then end
They only see me as a friend
You leave a lot to be desired
I never wanna be desired
