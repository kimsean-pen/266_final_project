Midwest love affair, I bend when I am bored
Midnight liquor blue will lead me to the floor
Can we fake it? Can we make believe?
I'm so full of love, it deeply sickens me

But all I can do is close my eyes
And cross my arms and hope to die
Cause you don't fucking listen when I'm around
The least you can do is take it back
All the vicious remarks and verbal attacks
Cause I can't fucking stand it when you're around

Midwest aftermath, the rumors start to rise
Did I truly do the things that you've described?
They must hate me, every single one
It just sickens them what I consider fun

No, I can't fucking stand it when you're around
