I woke up I was stuck in a dream
You were there you were tearing up everything
We all know how to fake it baby
We all know what we've done
We must be killers children of the wild ones
Killers, where we've got left to run
Killer, killer, killer, killer
Killer, killer, killer, killer

Set my body free
The Silver tigers in the moonlight running
And the wind in the trees singing do you believe?

We all know how to fake it baby
We know when its gone
We must be killers children of the wild ones
Killers where we got left to run
Killer, killer, killer, killer
Killer, killer, killer, killer

We all know how to fake it baby
We dont know what we've done
We must be killers children of the wild ones
Killers where we got left to run

Killer, killer, killer, killer
Killer, killer, killer, killer
