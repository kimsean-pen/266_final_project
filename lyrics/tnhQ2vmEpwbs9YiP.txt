When you called me and you knew I lied
Everybody was so disappointed
When the shadows covered up our eyes
I couldn't tell if I had disappeared at all

I guess so
In the end, you keep me up all night alone
I guess so
In the end, you keep me up all night alone
In the end, you keep me up all night

When you told me that you had to leave
Everybody was so torn apart, and
Rent a chalet in the Pyrenees
Meet me there and then we'll talk about it all

I guess so
In the end, you keep me up all night alone
I guess so
In the end, you keep me up all night

In the end, you keep me up all night alone
In the end, you keep me up all night alone
In the end, you keep me up all night
