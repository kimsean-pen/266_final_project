Dumb love and I do,
Love to be lied to
Dumb lovin', sane lovin',
I know we'll meet again

I could feel alri-i-ight,
This is where my lips open,
Every time I walk away,
I, find it, a real love, know (is) finally mine
Thinking that I should have known,
I find a new way on my own
Must be the way your love is sho-oh-oh-own,
Makes me feel so dumb
I gotta get somethi-hi-hi-hingâ€”

Dumb love and I do,
Love to be lied to
Dumb love, same lovin',
No, there will be no daaay-

Some love and I know
There's skill, a mile, Lu
Some loving, say something,
I know we'll be okay
(In the) Day I'll be thick,
Like a pig with no heart
Race to the finish before we start
Woah oah

Looking for sparks in the dead of the dark,
You'll leave no fire, and I've known more
Woah oah

Dumb love and I do,
Love to be lied to
Dumb love, sane loving
No, there will be no daaay-

Some love, and I know,
They skip a mile, Lu
Woah, oah
Son, love,
Say something,
"I know we'll be okay."

Woah oah ooh
Woah ooh/

Woah oah...
Woah oah ooh
Woah oah...
Woah oah ooh

Dumb love, and I do
Love to be lied to
Done lovin', sayin' nothin'
Now, there will be no day
Sun, love and I know
They skip a mile, Lou,
Son, love, say somethin'
"I know we'll be okay."
