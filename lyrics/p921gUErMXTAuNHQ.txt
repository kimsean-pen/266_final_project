Hold me in your arms may they keep me
Sing me a lullaby cos I'm sleepy
I'm scared you don't need me anymore

Bring me to the light of the morning
And take me through this night till the dawning
Oh I see a warning in your eyes

And I don't need no Valentines no no
Don't need no roses
Cos they just take me back in time no no
Now you're not here

Hold me just tonight sleep will tend me
Save me from lonely hours there's so many
And I won't get any sleep tonight

And I don't need no Valentines no no
Don't need no roses
They just take me back in time no no
Now you're not here anymore
Not anymore

And I don't need no Valentines no no
Don't need no roses
Cos they just take me back in time no no
To when you loved me only
And I won't drink no aged wine no no

Now you're not here anymore
Not anymore
Not anymore
Not anymore
