The sand that hides
The bones of the dead
Whispers in the wind
Rumors of our future

We shall build here
In this cursed place
Cruel structures
The towers of gods
In their shadows
We will ever toil
We will hide there
Waiting for a revelation
Citadels of sorrow
These relics of old
Sentinels of secrets
Hidden down below

These are the foundations
of burden that we laid
Must we feat on a bounty of blood?
The soul of the world in the mouths of all
Sick corruption in the fountain of life
It will sustain us
Was there even a choice?

Descendants of dust
With faces carved from stone
The legacy of what has gone
Our paths connected by a thread
Only remains of the lies we led
Impart the weight of the years we shed
