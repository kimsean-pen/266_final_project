Will I fall again into dismay?
Will I be ashamed of crying?
And I know it's never been the way that I described
But I am afraid of trying
She's the one who keeps me all excited
She keeps me begging for more
She's the one who deems me uninvited
Now it's over
Never leave me, and don't deceive me
I'll keep on crawling my friend
Never tease me, and dont leave me here
It's all the same in the end
Now I find that I am weaker fare
That I am ashamed of lying
And I know things never feel the way that's right inside
And I am afraid of dying
'Cause you're the one who keeps me all excited
You keep me begging for more
You're the one who keeps me uninvited
Now it's over
Never leave me, and don't deceive me
I'll keep on crawling my friend
Never tease me, and don't leave me here
It's all the same in the end
Never leave me, and don't deceive me
I'll keep on crawling my friend
It's only a symbol
You've got me falling away
And I am afraid
Take back what I said
Never leave me, and don't deceive me
I'll keep on crawling my friend
Never tease me, and don't leave me here
It's all the same in the end
Never leave me, and don't deceive me
I'll keep on crawling my friend
Never tease me, and don't leave me here
It's all the same in the end
It's all the same in the end
It's all the same in the end
It's all the same in the end
It's only a symbol
