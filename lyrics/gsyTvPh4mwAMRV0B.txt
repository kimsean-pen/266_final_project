Maybe I'll learn the rules
Make out like the fools
Maybe I'll hide away in a daze
A life without pain

Maybe I'll sit around and time will lay me down
I'll make like good for nothing
Maybe I'll play the game and trade my trust for fame
Still be just as lonely
Maybe I'll learn the rules, make out like the fools
Maybe I'll ride a wave make my days a song with no name
