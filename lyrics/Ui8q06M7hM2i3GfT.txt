Rise, taste the air, lock and load, pull the trigger,
Climb, to new heights, and tell me, tell me what you hear...

A whisper from the wind, and I can't help but listen,
It warns us of disaster, and I can't help but wonder,
Can anyone hear the same distress call?

So this is a quest to save the world,
And he'll always be here for another,
Another day, another chance to rescue

(OK Jonny, lock and load)

This is all I need to feel alive,
(Remember now, aim small, missed mark)

The crashing of white waves and I can't help but listen,
The screaming of the Earth, and I can't help but...

So this is a quest to save the world,
And he'll always be here for another,
Another day, another chance to rescue

And this is all I need to feel alive, (oh yeah)
(Hey Jonny!)
This is all I need to feel alive

Way to save the world!
Way to save the world!
Way to save the world!
Way... to save... the world!

So this is a quest to save the world,
And he'll always be here for another,
Another day, another chance to rescue

So this is a quest to save the world,
And he'll always be here for another,
Another day, another chance to rescue

This is all I need to feel alive [x9]
