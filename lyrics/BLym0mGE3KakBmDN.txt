Some will say
This place is wrong
These hands are fast
This face is long

Just, stopp upsetting yourself
Upsetting your thoughts
Upsetting this world
That you're standing on

These plans are torn
These feet are cold
This shield is worn
This peace was stolen

Stop upsetting yourself
Upsetting your thoughts
Upsetting this world
That you're standing on

These problems they breathe
And their fire is real
And the coins that they keep
You cannot steal

Even when you're asleep
They'll be here still
Just breathing out or in

Some will say this place is gone
These roads are steep
And much too long

These plans are cheap
My feet are cold
Just cut the knot
These coins are golden

Some will say this place is gone

And their fire is real
