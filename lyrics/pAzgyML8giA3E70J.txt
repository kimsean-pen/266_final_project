And every time you crave for me i'm, here
And anything you hunger for i'll share
And i will be quietly standing by
While slowly i am dying inside

Hold me in your arms
And let me be the one who can feel
Like i am a child in love

Every time i talk to you you're down
And every time you need a laugh i'm around
And when you forget i'm here i'm not
It isn't really me that you forgot

Hold me in your arms
And let me be the one who can feel
Like i am a child in love

Whisper now
And tell me how you'll watch me
And tell me somehow i'm gonna be alright
