Bright blue sky, the little sea Let the sun warm in its way to me
Feeling love to a distant mass It's all in my hands Don't mend fences
where they tear and Pull the wind from the thinning air
Hold it tight, but don't go pell mell I'm ready, can't you tell?

Fall forward and then look back Gotta rock steady and stay on track
Look ahead where our future hides But the world waits wide-eyed If we
care, we can have it all And if we don't,
then it's good because Such a fine
fervor you compel I'm ready, can't you tell?
Can't you tell?
Can't you tell?
I'm ready
Can't you tell?
