Move on up, you're such a sexy groover
When you get on down you're better than another
Move on up, it's such a hot sensation
When you get along, get along, get along
Oh I could rule this nation
Get on down, you tie me up now, baby
You just tie me up
There's no time for maybe

'Cause I'm a lady, lady, lady, easy lady
Lady playin' passion through the night
'Cause I'm a lady, lady, lady, easy lady
Playin' with emotions, move on up

Move on up, I'm gonna tease you lover
Gonna work on you, my love you will discover
Move on up, you really gotta please me
Try try harder now, you know you must appease me

'Cause I'm a lady, lady, lady, easy lady
Lady playin' passion through the night
'Cause I'm a lady, lady, lady, easy lady
Playin' with emotions
'Cause I'm a lady, lady, hard and easy lady
Keep on playin' passion through the night
'Cause I'm a lady, lady, lady, easy lady
Playin' with emotions, move on up

You're livin' inside me
You're movin' on by me
You're love and passion
Groove it and move it
Show me you can use it

'Cause I'm a lady, lady, lady, easy lady
Lady playin' passion through the night
'Cause I'm a lady, lady, lady, easy lady
Playin' with emotions
'Cause I'm a lady, lady, hard and easy lady
Keep on playin' passion through the night
'Cause I'm a lady, lady, lady, easy lady
Playin' with emotions, move on up
