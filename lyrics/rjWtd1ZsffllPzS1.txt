Close your eyes and make believe
This is where you want to be
Forgetting all the memories
Try to forget love cause love's forgotten me

Well hey, hey baby, it's never too late
Pretty soon you won't remember a thing
And I'll be distant, the stars reminiscing
Your heart's been wasted on me
Ohhh...

You've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you
My little decoy
Don't look so blue, you should've seen right through
I'm using you, my little decoy
My little decoy

Live your life inside a dream
Time is changing everything
Forgetting all the memories
And I'm forcing to you just cause you're into me

Well hey, hey baby, it's never too late
When I'm gone you won't remember a thing
But I can't stay and you know I won't wait
I was gone from the very first day
Ohhh...

You've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you
My little decoy
Don't look so blue, you should've seen right through
I'm using you, my little decoy

Oh, oh
I'm not sorry at all
(not sorry at all, not sorry, no)
I won't be sorry at all
(not sorry at all, not sorry, no)
I'd do it over again
Don't look so blue, my little decoy
You should've seen right through, my little decoy
You've never been so used, my little decoy
And so I'm using you, my little decoy
