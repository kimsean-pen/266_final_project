Staring out at the rain with a heavy heart
It's the end of the world in my mind
Then your voice pulls me back like a wake-up call (call)

I've been looking for the answer somewhere
I couldn't see that it was right there
But now I know what I didn't know

Because you live and breathe
Because you make me believe in myself
When nobody else can help
Because you live, girl
My world has twice as many stars in the sky

It's all right, I survived, I'm alive again (again)
'Cause of you, made it through every storm
What is life, what's the use if you're killing time

I'm so glad I've found an angel
Someone who was there when all my hopes fell
I wanna fly looking in your eyes

Because you live and breathe
Because you make me believe in myself
When nobody else can help
Because you live, girl (You live girl)
My world (My world) has twice as many stars in the sky
Because you live, I live

Because you live, there's a reason why
I carry on when I lose the fight
I want to give what you've given me always

Because you live and breathe
Because you make me believe in myself
When nobody else can help
(when no one else can help)
Because you live, girl
My world (My world) has twice as many stars in the sky

Because you live and breathe
Because you make me believe in myself
When nobody else can help
Because you live, girl (You live girl)
My world has everything I need to survive
Because you live
I live
I live
