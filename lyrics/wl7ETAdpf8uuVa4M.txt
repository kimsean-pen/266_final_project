Eyes are on your phone
At the edge of my bed with your hand on my leg
What you smiling for?
Was it something I said? Is she back already?
Know that I shouldn't get used to you
I keep my composure
Used to being used by you

I don't know what's worse
That you walked in my room
Smelling like her perfume
Or that I called you first
Thought that I was immune
Wouldn't let you get any closer
I shouldn't get used to you
Losing my composure
You love me being lost in you

You lie on my sheets, then lie to my face
I lie through my teeth and say I'm okay
Won't settle for a second place
You could say you warned me
But this time I mean it
I'm so sick of these dead end feelings

Scrolling through my thoughts
At the edge of regret, got my hands on my head
I gotta cut you off
Hope it hurts you like it hurt me
You're gonna have to stop getting so used to me
Always crawling back to, let you get the best of me
You lie on my sheets, then lie to my face
(You lie to my face)
I lie through my teeth and say I'm okay
(Say I'm okay)
Won't settle for a second place
You could say you warned me
But this time I mean it
I'm so sick of these dead end feelings

Missed calls and text messages
I deserve more than this
Not just when I am with you
When she is just pissed off at you
And you tell her you're through
You'll crawl right on back
In a day or two, déjà-vu
I know you'll never change
And I, I will never stay
'Cause your lies they stay the same
On my own I will be okay

You lie on my sheets, then lie to my face
I lie through my teeth and say I'm okay
Won't settle for a second place
You could say you warned me
But fuck if you mean it
I'm so sick of these dead end feelings
