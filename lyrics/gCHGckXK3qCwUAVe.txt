I got my mind on my money
And my money on my mind, what?
Don't get it twisted, I put you in a headlock
These pop bitches make you fucking sick, right?
We party hard, they call the cops, uh

Teenage skanks got nothing on me
Pop bitches got nothing on me
I scratch 'til it bleeds
All you bitches got nothing on me
Nothing on me

The world is mine, yeah
I just got signed, yeah
I pay no mind, yeah
Pop bitches

You can take all my money
I can always make more, what?
Rip my style, and I'll see you in court
These pop bitches make me fucking sick, uh
We party hard, they call the cops, c'mon

Teenage skanks got nothing on me
Pop bitches got nothing on me
I scratch 'til it bleeds
All you bitches got nothing on me
Nothing on me

I pay no mind, yeah
The world is mine, yeah
I just got signed, yeah
I pay no mind, yeah
I pay no mind, yeah
The world is mine, yeah
I just got signed, yeah
I pay no mind, yeah
Pop bitches
