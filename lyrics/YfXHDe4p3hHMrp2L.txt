There's no escape, from this place
But somehow you unlocked all the chains

Paralyzed in authentic fear
Cause I'm insane, and I'm deranged

You mustn't share twisted affairs, with all your peers
So I'll push you down the stairs

And I'll hide you down in the dark for years!

This Cannot be, it must be a dream
(More like a corrupted nightmare)
I can't bare this harsh reality
(This can't be the end of my story)
She's my only destiny
(Can't be the end of my story)
We must create, our own fate
I took her life, now it's too late.
This Cannot be, it must be a dream
I can't bare this harsh reality

We must create, our own fate
I took her life, now it's too late.
