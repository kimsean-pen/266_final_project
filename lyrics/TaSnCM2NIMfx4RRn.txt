Too many people
Coming out of doors
In and out of my life
In the night, in the day
I've got to make it on my own

Somebody asked me
How do you do it
Tell them that I'm justified
Of the truth to myself
You know I feel so low

Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes
Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes

Complicate the matter
Playing on the weakness
Taking all of my time
I'll go down, with the ship
To the bottom like a stone

Falling off the ladder
Holy water hell hound
Falling like a jack knife
But the truth to myself
You know it cuts through the bone

Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes
Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes

Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes

Yeah, (somebody, somebody, open my eyes
Somebody, somebody, open my eyes)

Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes
Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes

Somebody, somebody, somebody come and open my eyes
(Somebody, somebody).
