Hey babe, thought maybe
Can't deal, not today.
Wish it didn't faze me
Can't handle either way.

With light surrounded, Entombed and warm
Don't lie to her, no bones, no form.
The vast expanses, they need to grind
to glow together, melt our minds

Hey babe, can't do it.
Cant put you there again.
Can't deal, can't go through it
If there only was a when.

With light surrounded, entombed and warm.
Don't lie to her, no bones, no form.
The vast expanses, the need to grind
They're inside our minds.
