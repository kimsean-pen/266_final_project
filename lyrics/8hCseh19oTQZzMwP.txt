I've been calling different cities home
looking for the parts of me I didn't get to know
I know myself a little more the more I let you go
I've been calling different cities home
but only on the days my hands are cold
cause I fell for you that morning in the snow
and here in california you're not on my mind much more
only on the days my hands are cold

(you like to tell me I changed
like anybody really stays the same?) x2

you know me better than I wish you did
you're a bigger part of me than I admit
and I hate that my whole family's gotta ask me how you've been
you know me better than I wish you did

(you like to tell me I changed
like anybody really stays the same?) x2

but now that you're just something to explain
why accepting those this hard for me someday
yeah I still got some habits that she's helping me to break
now that you're just something to explain

(You like to tell me I changed
like anybody really stays the same?) x2
