Just from fighting
Just one anniversary
So I never thought you'd be the one to up and leave
You said our love was written in the stars

But I never paid attention to my charts
But now I see how quick you must want to forget
Cause you left the ring I bought you with your cigarettes
Well I can finish up if you don't want them
And I can take the ring back where I got it from

I can love it, or
I can leave it
You said honey, I
Best believe it
Cause your a novice, and
I'm a taurus, and
I'm not gonna say
I'm not gonna do

I can love it, or
I can leave it
You say honey I
Best believe it
Cause you're a taurus, and
I'm aquarius, and
I'm not gonna say
I'm not gonna do

Never thought about it sentimentally
Never saw just how much you thought I meant to me
Never learned about it at university
Never thought about it cause your the first, you see
And I'm aware of the procedure
But normally it's me that leaves her
I guess I'm finished up
It's time to move on
I'm taking the ring back to where I got it from

I can love it, or
I can leave it
You said honey I, best believe it
Cause your a novice, and
I'm a taurus, and
I'm not gonna say
I'm not gonna do

I can love it
I can leave it
You said honey, I
Best believe it
Cause your a novice and
I'm a taurus
We've had problem.
We're notorious for them
It's what your friends said
Now you're inside there.
I've seen our stars and
There's nothing aligning.
That's
Cause I'm Aquarius
Yeah I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
