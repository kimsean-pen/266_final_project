I know
My life's not gonna change
And i'll live
Through all these wasted days
Never thought
That i'd end up this way
And I know
It's gonna stay the same

I thought
I would
Be more
Than this

I know
I'm losing all my time
Can't believe
That it was all mine
Feeling sick
But I don't know why
Getting tired
Of living till I die
