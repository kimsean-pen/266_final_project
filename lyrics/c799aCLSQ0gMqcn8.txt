We worry about echoes
While we are being held back
By the speed of light

This is the time
Of no regret
In a forward momentum race
We leave in our wake
What is broken, forgotten and old

I squint my eyes
As if to make
My sight extend a little further

This is the time
Of no regret
In a forward momentum race
We leave in our wake
What is broken and forgotten

The dream is nothing
Yet it drives us to the end
These words that force our hand
Hold on, hold on

In fear of true deception
Our lives are being brought back
Brought back down

This is the time
Of no regret
In a forward momentum race
We leave in our wake
What is broken and forgotten
