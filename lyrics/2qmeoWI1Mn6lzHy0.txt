A strong resemblance of your old ways
It reminds me that I haven't changed
I gave very little, but I gave what I could
I remember the sound of slamming doors
And the way yours was always better in the morning
Your new direction is more like a different way home
It's not fair to underestimate the reasons that I let go
It's not right to make a tired example of how I failed
If I could, then I would have Indiana by now
