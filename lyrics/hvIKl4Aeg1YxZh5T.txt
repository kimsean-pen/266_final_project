There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
I got a reason that you're who should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it's right but it's all wrong
Tonight, yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
Right on the limb, it's where we know we both belong tonight
It's hard to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous

I'm gonna run right to
To the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you

I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you, ohh...
On the e-edge with you
Another shot before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life tonight

Alright, alright
Put on your shades 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames
Tonight, yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
It isn't hell if everybody knows my name tonight

Alright, alright
It's hard to feel the rush (Feel the rush)
To brush the dangerous (Dangerous)
I'm gonna run right to

To the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge

I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you
Ooh, yeah yeah...
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you
