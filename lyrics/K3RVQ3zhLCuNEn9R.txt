You know, there's a lot of reasons we're doing this.
One of the main ones is that we deal only with our friends,
we don't have to rely on business contracts or anything like that.
We don't use contracts.
We don't make them sign anything.
We don't take away the rights to their songs.
Nothing.
You know, we just work with our friends.
It just works out to be a better situation for us because I have a
lot of contempt for the record industry and I don't
particularly want to be a part of it any more than I have to.
The fact that we started our own label is proof of that.
When you don't want to be a part of
something, you do it yourself, so we did."
