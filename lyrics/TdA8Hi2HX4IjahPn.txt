I remember everything you said
into my head right before you died
it was the weekend
it was November
I had a strange dream
it was my birthday
I learned about it from a neighbor
you had a bad trip
you crawled right down the hall
you took your fingers you found the cupboard
you twisted off the caps of every single bottle
it's like a waterfall
it's like a laser
it's like a miracle
it's a sharp razor
it was a Thursday
I ran right over
you were laying there twisted at the knees
I remember everything you said
I remember everything you said
I remember everything you said
I remember everything you said
I remember everything you said
I remember everything you said
I remember everything you said
I remember everything you said
