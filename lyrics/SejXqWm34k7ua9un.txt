Beware the night
Beware the night before the dawn
Beware the dark when light is gone
For there's a phantom lust awake
They wanna make you bend and scream
They wanna take your hand and lead you in the light of Venus, girl
Come let them take you for a ride
Forget the Lord and cross tonight
and let your carnal lust prevail tonight

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh
Demons come at night and they bring the end
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh
Demons are a girl's best friend
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh
Demons come to life and they take command
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh
Demons are a girl's best friend

Beware the fire
Beware the fire in their eyes
Beware of former driven lies
For there's a truth behind the veil
They make you part of blackened rites
For take the crave between your thighs
Your antidote of evil, girl
Come resurrect him to the sky
And wave all innocence goodbye
And let desire take command tonight

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh
Demons come at night and they bring the end
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh
Demons are a girl's best friend
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh
Demons come to life and they take command
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh
Demons are a girl's best friend

And when your sleep is haunted in the night
Girl don't you dare to seek for candlelight
'Cause in the dark the demons come as carnal dynamite

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh
Demons of the night come and take her hand
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh
Demons are a girl's best friend
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh
Demons treat her thighs, come and make their stand
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh
Demons are a girl's best friend
