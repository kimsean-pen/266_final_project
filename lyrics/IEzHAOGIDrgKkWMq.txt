Guilt and Regret, they are my two inbred brothers
Guilt and Regret
O god how I hate them both from the bottom of my heart

Guilt and Regret and me wake up into a brand new day
Guilt and Regret lively
I am still dead tired - the night has been long and hard

My brothers they ask me:
"Do you recall anything from yester-night, no?"
They laugh at me and go:
"Nothing at all? Well, it must have been an evening of joy"

Guilt and Regret
O god how I hate them both from the bottom of my heart

Each morning like this they come, uninvited
Pale as ghosts, reeking of compost
Yet most I abhor their bloodshot eyes

My brothers they ask me:
"Do you recall anything from yester-night, no?"
They laugh at me and go:
"Nothing at all? Well, it must have been an evening of joy"
My brothers they tease me:
"Do you remember anything from yester-night, no?"
They laugh at me and go:
"O sure you do, we buried our little sister Hope"

Guilt and Regret and me - what a twisted family we are
Guilt and Regret
O god, how I hate you both from the bottom of my heart
