Lost in a picture frame
The way our bodies used to behave
The way we smiled in the moment
Before they permanently froze
But that was the old me and you, when we were both lookers
Lost in a picture frame
The way my body used to behave
The way I smiled in the moment
Before it permanently froze
But that was the old me, I was such a looker in the old days
You little kerouac, always running like Dean and Sal
Always waiting on a freight train
Always looking for a story to tell
But that was the old you, you were such a looker in the old days
Yeah! We were both lookers
Sha la la la, Jersey girls are always total heartbreakers
Julie from the Wonder Bar, I still wonder where you are
Cause I know the old you, and you know the old me
When we were both lookers
I was certain that I'd find her, in the back of the diner
In a cloud full of nicotine, in a teenaged memory
That I hold till eternity
Cause the future ain't coming for it
Sha la la la, Jersey girls are always total heartbreakers
Julie from the Wonder Bar, I still wonder where you are
Cause I know the old you, and you know the old me
When we were both lookers
In a 5"x8" black and white on the night stand of my mind
From a time I hardly recognize
Sha la la la, Jersey girls are always total heartbreakers
Julie from the Wonder Bar, I still wonder where you are
Cause I know the old you, and you know the old me
When we were both lookers
