Hopeless
Everybody says it's just another decay of the soul
But I know I'm a hopeless follower of anything
To take me away from this hole in the ground

I found it hopeless clinging to a feeling
Like a fish on a line
It's sublime to find it lately hopeless
No more saying there is no more time

I've was trying far too hard
To be what I thought I should be
I was playing wild cards
And seeing things that weren't in front of me
Like a little tiger play fighting
I was hurting myself again and again

Because I'm hopeless
Everybody says it's just another decay of the soul
But I know I'm a hopeless follower of anything
To take me away from this hole in the ground

I found it hopeless clinging to a feeling
Like a fish on a line
It's sublime to find it lately hopeless
No more saying there is no more time
There is no more time

Well, I'm just discovering I'm living in a different body
Got a little insight into everything that's happening to me
Like a little spider I'm climbing the insurmountable
But I never hold myself accountable, no

Because I'm hopeless, everybody says I'm hopeless
But I got a bit of hopelessness
Oh, and you can never bring me down
Even though I've got some solid ground
Oh, because I love it so and I think you should know

That I'm hopeless
Everybody says it's just another decay of the soul
But I know I'm a hopeless follower of anything
To take me away from this hole in the ground

I found it hopeless clinging to a feeling
Like a fish on a line
It's sublime to find it lately hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
No more saying there is no more time
