I won't suffer
Be broken
Get tired
Or wasted
Surrender to nothing
Or give up what I
Started and stopped in
From end to beginning
A new day is coming
And I am finally free

Run away
Run away
I'll attack
Run away
Run away
Go chase yourself
Run away
Run away now
I'll attack
I'll attack
I'll a-
WHOAAAA

I would've kept you forever
But we had to sever
It ended for both of us
Faster than a
Kill off this thinking
It's starting to sink in
I'm losing control now
But without you I can finally see

Run away
Run away
I'll attack
Run away
Run away
Go chase yourself
Run away
Run away now
I'll attack
I'll attack
I'll a-
WHOAAAA

Your promises
They look like lies
Your honesty
Like a back that hides a knife
I promise you (promise you)
I promise you (promise you)
That I am finally free

Run away
Run away
I'll attack
Run away
Run away
Go chase yourself
Run away
Run away now
I'll attack
I'll attack
I'll attack
I will attack

Run away (I'll attack)
I will attack
Run away (I'll attack)
I will attack
Run away (I'll attack)
Run away now
I'll attack
I'll attack
I'll a-
WHOAAAA

Your promises (promises)

I promise you (promise you)
I promise you (promise you)
