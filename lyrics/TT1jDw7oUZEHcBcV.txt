If only I could get into that corner of your head
Where things finally match and meet the standards that you set
Oh, how I wish I was the treasure that you were lookin' for
I bet I would feel better if only I could find the door

Well I am cryin'
You aren't tryin'
And I am melting away

I wait for the words on the tip of your tongue
I'm only as good as the last one
Well, you decide and I abide as my song goes unsung
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

Things are goin' crazy and I'm not sure who to blame
Everything is changing and I do not feel the same
I'm slippin' through the cracks of floors I thought that were strong
I'm tryin' to find a place where I can feel like I belong

Well, I am cryin'
You aren't tryin'
And I am melting away

I wait for the words on the tip of your tongue
I'm only as good as the last one
Well, you decide and I abide as my song goes unsung
Yeah yeah, as my song goes unsung, yeah yeah yeah

If I could be the lesson that you learn, you learn, if only
I could be the last one that love burns, it burns, if only
I could be the lesson that you learn, you learn, if only
I could be the last one that love burns, it burns, yeah yeah

If only I could get into that corner of your head
Where things finally match and meet the standards that you set
Oh, how I wish I was the treasure that you were lookin' for
I bet I would feel better if only I could find the door

Well, I am cryin'
You aren't tryin'
And I am melting away

I wait for the words on the tip of your tongue
I'm only as good as the last one
Well, you decide and I abide as my song goes unsung
Well, you decide and I abide as my song goes unsung
Yeah yeah, as my song goes unsung, yeah yeah
As my song goes unsung, yeah yeah yeah yeah
