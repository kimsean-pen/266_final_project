Get up, get up
I like this
Just like this
Do you feel it?
Then get up
Get up
Just like this

Do you wanna catch the vibe?
That's keepin' me alive
I'm followin' these fat ass beats until I die
Fill 'em with tension, the sick dimension
I rumble the earth with the lowered suspension
Just watch the ground move, let the sound prove
That it ain't fake when the girls get naked

Don't call it a comeback, we bring that beat back
And we make sure that John kept them beats phat
A lyrical rampage, burnin' your headset
Open your mind, my rhymes ain't dead yet
I want you to stand up, and put them hands up
And break it down 'cause you're pumpin' my band up

I like this
Just like this
C'mon get up
Get up, get up
Music is key
It's the way we're set free
From all this world is throwin' at me

The rhythm's so insane, it's flowin' through your vein
Triggerin' that neck poppin' nerve up in your brain
I don't even know ya, but came to show ya
The Bizkit's limp when the night is over
We shake the whole place, make this earthquake
And it ain't fake when we start the riots

Rock the bells, psycho females
Doin' time, blowin' up the phoneline
Call it a stampede, comin' to your town
We ain't gonna hold back, we're comin' to get down
I want ya to stand up, and put them hands up
And break it on down 'cause you're pumpin' my band up

I like this
Baby, just like this
Get high up
C'mon, get up
Music is key
It's the way we're set free
From all this world is throwin' at me
And I'll do what it takes
If I make some mistakes
It's okay 'cause it's all just the way it should be
I break it

Limp Bizkit's in the house you all
Limp Bizkit's in the house you all
Limp Bizkit's in the house you all
Yo John, bring that beat back

Uhh, just like this
Do you feel it?
Just like this
Yo bring that beat back
Music is key
It's the way we're set free
From all this world is throwin' at me
And I do what it takes
If I make some mistakes
It's okay 'cause it's all just the way it should be
