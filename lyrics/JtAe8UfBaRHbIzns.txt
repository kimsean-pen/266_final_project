Night swimming, beach walking
Always silent, never talking
Then you call my name
And I know inside I love you
Sail away, I miss you more
Until you see the shore
There I will be waiting
Anticipating

Each moment is new
Freeze the moment
Each moment is cool
Freeze the moment

I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere else but here
I wouldn't wanna change
Anything at all (anything oh)
I wouldn't wanna take
Everything out on you
Though I know I do (although I know I do)
Every time I fall

Day dreaming, chain smoking
Always laughing, always joking
I remain the same
Did I tell you that I love you?
Brush your teeth and pour a cup of
Black coffee out - I love to
Watch you do that every day
The little things that you do

Each moment is new
Freeze the moment
Each moment is cool
Freeze the moment

I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere else but here
I wouldn't wanna change
Anything at all (anything oh)
I wouldn't wanna take
Everything out on you
Though I know I do (although I know I do)
Every time I fall

Hmmmmmm
Hmmmmmm
Each moment is cool
Freeze the moment

I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere else but here
I wouldn't wanna change
Anything at all (anything oh)
I wouldn't wanna take
Everything out on you
Though I know I do (although I know I do)
Every time I fall (every time I fall, every time I fall)

I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere else but here (oh anywhere but here)
I wouldn't wanna change (I wouldn't wanna change)
Anything at all (anything oh)
I wouldn't wanna take
Everything out on you
Though I know I do (although I know I do)
Every time I fall

Night swimming, beach walking
Always silent, never talking
Then you call my name
And I know inside I love you
Sail away, I miss you more
Until you see the shore
There I will be waiting
Anticipating
Hmmmmmm
Hmmmmmm
