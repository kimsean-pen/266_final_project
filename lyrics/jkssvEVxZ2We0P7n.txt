Hello, it's late
You know I've tried to stop the rain
Did you read about it?
Did you think about it?
Did you cry but nothing came?

Nothing matter's again
I didn't think we'd last that long
But I'm just sitting on this Merry-Go-Round
And the music is too loud

It's just a game that we used to play
I didn't think we'd take it all the way
It kills me just because it can't be erased
We're married

Hello, it's late
I know we tried to win the game
Did you hear about it?
Did you dream about it?
I know you cried but nothing changed

Nothing matter's again
I didn't think we'd last that long
But I'm just sitting on this Merry-Go-Round
And the music is too loud

It's just a game that we used to play
I didn't think we'd take it all the way
It kills me just because it can't be erased
We're married, married

But I'm just sitting on this Merry-Go-Round
And the music is too loud

It's just a game that we used to play
I didn't think we'd take it all the way
It kills me just because it can't be erased
We're married, married
Married, married
