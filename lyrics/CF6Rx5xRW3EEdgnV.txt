What's left hanging
In the air
In the air

Break the cycle
Round and round
Round and round we go

You play hide and seek
Now I see
Now I see the light

Eyes spill over
Start to swim
Start to swim away

These strange faces
It was only yesterday we spoke on the phone
A distant memory from all those years ago
But now I'm looking
At these strange faces
And I'm not coming home

I've never heard you speak like this
On the phone
On the phone

You carry the weight and I take the guilt
Brings me down
Brings me down to this

These strange faces
It was only yesterday we spoke on the phone
A distant memory from all those years ago
But now I'm looking
At these strange faces
And I'm not coming home
