I saw the light, I've been baptized
By the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man

Well, the whole town's talking
'Bout the line I'm walking
That leads right to your door
Oh how I used to roam
I was a rolling stone

I used to have a wild side
They say a country mile wide
I'd burn those beer joints down
That's all changed now
You turned my life around

I saw the light, I've been baptized
By the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man

I used to love 'em and leave 'em
Oh, I'd brag about my freedom
How no one could tie me down
Then I met you
Now my heart beats true

Baby, you and me together
Feels more like forever
Than anything I've ever known
We're right on track
I ain't lookin' back

Yeah, I saw the light, I've been baptized
By the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man

ohh... I saw the light, I've been baptized
By the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man
Yeah, I saw the light, I've been baptized
By the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man
