Mother, mother, how's the family?
I'm just calling to say hello
How's the weather? How's my father?
Am I lonely? Heavens no

Mother mother are you listening?
Just a phone call to ease your mind
Life is perfect, never better
Distance making the heart grow fond

When you sent me off to see the world
Were you scared that I might get hurt?
Would I try a little tobacco?
Would I keep on hiking up my skirt?

I'm hungry, I'm dirty
I'm losing my mind, everything's fine!
I'm freezing, I'm starving
I'm bleeding to death, everything's fine!

Yeah, I'm working, making money
I'm just starting to build a name
I can feel it, around the corner
I could make it any day

Mother mother, can you hear me?
Sure I'm sober, sure I'm sane
Life is perfect, never better
Still your daughter, still the same

If I tell you what you want to hear
Will it help you to sleep well at night?
Are you sure that I'm your perfect dear?
Now just cuddle up and sleep tight
I'm hungry, I'm dirty
I'm losing my mind, everything's fine!
I'm freezing, I'm starving
I'm bleeding to death, everything's fine!
I miss you, I love you
