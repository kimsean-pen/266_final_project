Koffee come in like a rapture

Koffee come in like a rapture
And everybody get capture
Place lift up like helicopter
When dem see di lyrics contractor
Koffee come in like a rapture
Everybody get capture
Place lift up like helicopter
Aye!

When dem see di lyrical doctor

Koffee hottin up di temperature
Fi dem see
Mi know dem envy but friend mi fi end mi
Yo a first mi see people deh round me so plenty
But mi pocket nu empty mi need space
Oh Lord hear me
See dem a watch me through a crack now
A mussi true me have di ting pon lock down
Sitting ina di Bentley, pickiny a di century
Yuh drench mi but fi mi fiyah gon blaze
And a same way suh
Mi see di enemy a protest
And him couldn't come di closest
A Koffee still a do the mostest
A wa me do put in the work
And trust the process, oh yes
A so we grind right now
Koffee wid di, Koffee wid di prime time flow

Time fi we accumulate di coins I know
Jah gimme di, Jah gimme di signs like woah

Koffee come in like a rapture
And everybody get capture
Place lift up like helicopter
When dem see di lyrics contractor
Koffee come in like a rapture

Place lift up like helicopter

Tell dem gwaan chill until di Koffee done brew, ooh

Koffee come in like a rapture
And everybody get capture
Place lift up like helicopter
When dem see di lyrics contractor
Koffee come in like a rapture
And everybody get capture
Place lift up like helicopter
