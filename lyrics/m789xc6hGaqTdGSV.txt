Are we really sure
Can a love that lasted for so long still endure?
Do I really care, hey hey
Let's talk about the distractions goin' on elsewhere

I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark, hoo?

My mind, just now and then
Looking down dark corridors and wonders what might have been
Something's up ahead
Hey, should I keep this same direction or go back instead?

I, keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, oh in the dark
Why I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark, hoo?

Honey, now let's stop walkin' around
When there's love lost to be found
Oh, and you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense of goin' elsewhere?

Who feels really sure?
Can that feelin' guarantee your happiness shall endure?
And do we, really care, hey hey?
Let's look at what's been happening and try to be more aware

I, I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, hey in the dark
Why I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark, hoo?

Hey, hey, let's stop walkin' around, yeah
Well, when there's love lost, lost to be found
Oh honey, you know, I still care, I still care
What's the sense of goin', goin' elsewhere?

Oh honey, let's stop walking around, and around and around
When there's no love to be found
Hey baby, you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense of goin', goin' elsewhere?
