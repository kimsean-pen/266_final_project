I think I need a little bit to process
What you've done
I think we really need to talk about it
One on one
Every little thing you do about it
Falls like rust
Every where in the air you feel me
Move like dust
You can hear the night sky calling
Out your name
It's a wonder it's a hunger
It's different but all the same
When we break through Interspace
Galaxies fall from grace
And no matter what we have to face
We never let go we never let go
I had a feeling there was something out there
Just for us
I can't stop this agitation
Wanderlust
You Attack, Decay and torture me
But nothing Sustains me like your Release
We communicate in waveforms
Just like these
You can hear the night sky calling
Out your name
It's a wonder it's a hunger
It's different but all the same
When we break through Interspace
Galaxies fall from grace
And no matter what we have to face
We never let go we never let go
