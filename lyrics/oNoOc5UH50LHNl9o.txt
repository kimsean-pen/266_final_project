Lose yourself in lights
And we'll always have tonight.
Can't these days hold fast?
We're not the only ones to ask.
Save us when we're old.
Blinded in the afterglow...

Faded memories:
They're all we'll have, they're all we'll need
I'll remember you just as you'll always want me to.
So find us when we're old.
Laughing in the afterglow...

When did my friends slip right through my fingers?
And you, you were all I ever knew,
Oh you were all I ever knew.
Laughing in the afterglow...
