Whatever poison is in this bottle
Will leave me broken sore and stiff
But it's the genie at the bottom
Who I'm sucking at, he owes me one last wish

So here's a present
To let you know I still exist
I hope the next boy that you kiss
Has something terribly contagious on his lips

But I got a plan, drink for forty days and forty nights
A sip for every second-hand tick
And every time you fed me the line
You mean so much to me, I'm without you

Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the States
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say

Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boys back in the States
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say

And even if her plane crashes tonight
She'll find some way to disappoint me
By not burning in the wreckage
Or drowning at the bottom of the sea

Jess, I still taste you
Thus reserve my right to hate you
And all this empty space that you create
Does nothing for my flawless sense of style

It's 8: 45, the weather is getting better by the hour
I hope it rains there all the time
And if you ever said you miss me
Then don't say you never lied, I'm without you

Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the States
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say

Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boys back in the States
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say
Who would do anything you say

Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it

Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it

No more songs about you
After this one I am done
You are, you are, you're gone

No more songs about you
After this one I am done
You are, you are, you're gone

So tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boys back in the States
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say

Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boys back in the States
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say
