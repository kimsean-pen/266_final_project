Covered our mouth in blood
Covered our mouth in blue
Give in to what you are
My love will come to you

Suffered is born to die
Suffered will make anew
Give up this sacrifice
My love will come to you

First to die
To be born
First to die
To be born

Covered our mouth in blood
Covered our mouth in blue
Give up this sacrifice
My love will come to you

First to die
To be born
First to die
To be born
First to die
First to die
First to die
To be born

This is rebirth
This is rebirth
This is rebirth
This is rebirth

Covered our mouth in blood
Covered our mouth blue
Give back the sacrifice
My love will come to you

First to die
To be born
First to die
To be born
First to die
First to die
First to die
To be born
