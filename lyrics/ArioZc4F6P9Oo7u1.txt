They're stuck inside my head, the things I must forget
The light shining through my window
They're stuck inside my head, the things I must forget
The light shining through my window

I fell a thousand feet, and I landed in my bed
Next time I'll try to go higher
And maybe I'll land in yours instead

I fell a thousand feet, and I landed in my bed
Next time I'll try to go higher
And maybe I'll land in yours instead
