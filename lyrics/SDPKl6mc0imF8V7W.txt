Stop and get me on the ride up (uh-huh-huh)
To the top .
(Can we have a little more on my voice?)
Stop and get me on the ride up (Uh-huh-huh)
On the top of the hill
I'm only going to the top of the hill

New corn yellow and slaughterhouse red
The birds keep singin' baby after you're dead
I'm gonna miss you plenty big ol' world
With your abalone earrings
And your mother of pearl (Uh-huh-huh)

Stop and get me on the ride up (Uh-huh-huh)
Stop and get me on the ride up (Huh)
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill

I need your moon to be the sky 'gainst
Don't get your trouser button stuck on the fence
Diego red and bedlam money are fine
Why don't you come up and see me sometime?

Stop and get me on the ride up (Uh-huh-huh)
Stop and get me on the ride up (Uh-huh-huh)
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill

There's very little leeway
I seen the mattress on the freeway
The moon rises over Dog Street
Jefferson says now everythings reet
Have all the lights burned out on Heaven again?
I'll never roll the number seven again
I'm made of bread and on a ocean of wine
Hear all the birdies on the phone just fine (Huh-huh)

Stop and get me on the ride up (Uh-huh-huh)
Stop and get me on the ride up (Uh-huh-huh)
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill (Hey!)

Black joke and the bean soup
Big sky and the Ford Coupe
Old maid and the dry bones
Red rover and the Skinny Bones Jones
Forty - seven mules to pull this train
We're gettin' married in the pouring rain
You need your differential, plenty of oil
You load the wagon till the end of the world (Uh-huh-huh)

Stop and get me on the ride up (Uh-huh-huh)
Stop and get me on the ride up (Hey!)
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill (Hey!)

What's your throttle made of
Is it money or bone?
Don't dawdle or you'll never get home
Opium, fireworks, vodka and meat
Scoot over and save me a seat (Hey!)

Stop and get me on the ride up (Uh-huh-huh)
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop
And get me on the ride up
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill (Hey!)

If I had it all to do over again
I'd try to rise above the laws of man
Why doncha gimme 'nother sip o' your cup?
Turn a Rolls - Royce into a chicken coup (Uh-huh-huh)

Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up (Hey!)
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin'
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill

Hey!

Stop and get me on the ride up (uh-huh-huh)
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin' to the top of the hill

Ha ha ha ha ha!
