Acid tooth
It's got nothing to do with you
But if you wanna watch me chew
My teeth are cutting you out

Stomachache well it must be in your head
It must be something that you did
Food just doesn't seem to work out

Am I rotting out?
Daddy says I got my mama's mouth
I'm all about
A forked tongue and a dirty house

Mom has said
Yes this happened to me long ago
And you've got to say I'm hurting [Incomprehensible]
No one would believe me when I said

Close my mouth
Was I born to accommodate
I'm so good at playing dead
Words just don't seem to come out

Am I rotting out?
Daddy says I got my mama's mouth
I'm all about
A forked tongue and a dirty house

Am I rotting out?
Daddy says I got my mama's mouth
I'm all about
A forked tongue and a dirty house

Should I eat something sweet instead
Wash away all those things we said
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
How many doctors will it take before I disintegrate?

It's got nothing to do with you
But if you wanna watch me chew
My teeth are cutting you out

Stomach ache well it must be in your head
It must be something that you did
Food just doesn't seem to work out

Am I rotting out?
Daddy says I got my mama's mouth
I'm all about
A forked tongue and a dirty house

Am I rotting out?
Daddy says I got my mama's mouth
I'm all about
A forked tongue and a dirty house

Am I rotting out?
Am I rotting, am I rotting, am I rotting out?
