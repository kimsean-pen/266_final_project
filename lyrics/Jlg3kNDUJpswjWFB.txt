You say I have everything
Well, I'm living on dreams and chains
But I sing for the things money can't buy

You say you don't believe
Well, could you just look at me?
Look deep into my eyes, my love

Well, have you ever been in love?
Have you touched the soul of someone?
Did the fear inside you make you turn and run?

I'll take off my cape for you
I'll take down my hair for you
Anything you want me to do, my love

Well, I'll sit home and wait for you
Oh darling, there's nothing that I'd rather do
Anything you want me to do, my love

Have you ever been in love?
Have you touched the soul of someone, baby?
Did the fear inside you make you turn and run?

You say I have everything
Well, I've been living on dreams and chains
I sing for the things that money can't buy me

Have you ever been in love?
Have you touched the soul of someone?
Did the fear inside you make you turn and run?

Anything my love
Anything my love
Any thing
