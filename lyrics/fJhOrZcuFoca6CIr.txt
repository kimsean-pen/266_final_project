You can't do it
You're not good enough, enough
Don't be stupid
You're not one of us, of us

You look, but nothing's there
But no one knows
And no one cares
And they're all right
And you were wrong
And you don't know
The words to their song

There'll be wave after wave of emotion
But none of them love
(The impossible must be done)
When you run down the road less travelled
And stare at the sun
(The impossible must be done)
God give me grace under pressure
'Cause I don't think I'm good enough
The impossible must be done

You're excluded
You can't play with us, with us
We all hate you
Cringe when you walk by
So walk on by

So what's someone to do
When they've got nothing else to choose?
Suppose there's nothing left to lose?
No one will know when you're gone

There'll be wave after wave of emotion
But none of it's love
(The impossible must be done)
When you run down the road less travelled
And stare at the sun
(The impossible must be done)
God give me grace under pressure
'Cause I don't think I'm good enough
The impossible must be done

The impossible must be done
The impossible must be done

Here lies the body
O someone who didn't try
Who gave up long ago
Before they died

Your face will never fit
And there's nowhere left to sit
Everything you've done is shit
And you're wasting your time
Mate move on

There'll be wave after wave of emotion
But none of it's love
(The impossible must be done)
When you run down the road less travelled
And stare at the sun
(The impossible must be done)
God give me grace under pressure
'Cause I don't think I'm good enough
The impossible must be done

The impossible must be done
The impossible must be done
