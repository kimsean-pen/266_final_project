The change will do you good
I always knew it would
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust

Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour
Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour

Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust
The sins of the flesh
Are simply sins of lust

Sweat's running down your back
Sweat's running down your neck
Heated couplings in the sun (Or is that untrue?)
Colder couplings in the night (Never saw your body)

Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust

The change will do you good
I always knew it would
You know the change will do you good
You know the change will do you good

Damaged goods, send 'em back
I can't work, I can't achieve, send me back
Open the till, give me the change you said would do me good
Refund the cost, you said you're cheap but you're so smart

Your sweat so sour
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust

The change will do you good
I always knew it would
You know the change will do you good
You know the change will do you good

I'm kissing you goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
