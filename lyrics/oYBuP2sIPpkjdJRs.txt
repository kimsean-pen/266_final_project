Late night driving in and I end up at my parents' house
Sitting in the front yard wishing you would come around
But I still, I wait for the call
And it's sad that I still care at all

'Cause baby you don't even know me
Baby you will never know me
And it's sad that I still care at all

Took it for granted, you had your chances
You know it kills me, could've been so easy
I spend every night now wondering about how you're feeling about her
You want it so bad knowing that you
just can't love her like I do, yeah

'Cause baby you don't even know me
Baby you will never know me
And it's sad that I still care at all
And it's sad that I still care at all

'Cause baby you don't even know me
Baby you will never know me
And it's sad that I still care at all
'Cause baby you don't even know me
Baby you will never know me
And it's sad that I still care at all
