Hard times you had before you
I knew when I first saw you
You thought you'd always been mistreated, cheated
Don't leave it all behind you
It took so long to find you
I know that we can last forever, ever and ohhh
Ooooo, and ooooooo
(Don't cry)
Now that I have found you (don't cry)
Take a look around you (don't cry)
Took so long to find you
Do what you want
But little darling please don't cry
I knew i'd never doubt it
I was so sure about it
Don't think i've always been before, oorrr
I hear you when you're calling
I'll catch you when you're falling
Don't worry i will always be there
Like ever before... oorrree... orrrrr
(Don't cry)
Now that I have found you (don't cry)
Take a look around you (don't cry)
Took so long to find you
Do what you want
But little darling please don't cry
(Don't cry)
Now that I have found you (don't cry)
Take a look around you (don't cry)
Took so long to find you
Do what you want
But little darling please don't cry
(Don't cry)
Now that I have found you (don't cry)
Take a look around you (don't cry)
Took so long to find you
Do what you want
But little darling please don't cry
(Don't cry)
Don't cry
