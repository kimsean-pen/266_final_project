Thinking about those nusery rhyming days
When it was all just fun and games
Never had a care in the world
When it all begin to change
Go back to the Merry-go-round
Laughing and acting like clowns
Stay in this moment 'til
We see the sun go down

I treasure your heart of gold
I'll be your shadow when you feel alone
'Cause nothing changes when I'm on the road
To find your happy gotta lose control

If the time between us gets a little uneven
Don't you worry cause you will find me here
Never broke a promise, Never been dishonest
Don't you worry cause you will find me here
You can find me, find me
You can find me, find me
You can find me, find me
You can find me, find me

Feeling like I've been misunderstood
Like I heard she's gone to Hollywood
Couldn't be more wrong if you tried
Think you should take a hard look
It's not hard if you try
Try to see, through my eyes

I treasure your heart of gold
I'll be your shadow when you feel alone
'Cause nothing changes when I'm on the road
To find your happy gotta lose control

If the time between us gets a little uneven
Don't you worry cause you will find me here
Never broke a promise, Never been dishonest
Don't you worry cause you will find me here
You can find me, find me
You can find me, find me
You can find me, find me
You can find me, find me

If the time between us gets a little uneven
Don't you worry cause you will find me here
Never broke a promise, Never been dishonest
Don't you worry cause you will find me here
You can find me, find me
You can find me, find me
You can find me, find me
You can find me, find me
