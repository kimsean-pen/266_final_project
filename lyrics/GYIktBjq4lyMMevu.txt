Cool my brains and soothe my head
Stimulate me my Cococo
Sneak into my empty bed
And educate me my Cococo

In the summer, in the spring
In public places, my Cococo
On an island far away
Lemonade with my Cococo

And when I was down and failing life
You came and saved me, my Cococo
And when they said I'm telling lies
You believed me, my Cococo

And through the noise I heard a song
You were singing, my Cococo
And when you said that nothing's wrong
I believed you, my Cococo
But you were gone when I came through
And I'll remember you, oh oh
Well some day I'll dance with you
When I'm dreaming, my Cococo

I sat alone and I didn't care
I sat two years in the same old chair
I saw three roads and I didn't know
Which way to go, go, go, go
I need some help from a little love
I need some help from a little above
And you were there when I was feeling low
I won't forget you my Cococo

I sat alone and I didn't care
I sat two years in the same old chair
I saw three roads and I didn't know
Which way to go, go, go, go
I need some help from a little love
I need some help from a little above
And you were there when I was feeling low

I won't forget you Coco (x4)

I won't forget you no no (x4)

Because you're my Coco
You're my Coco
My Coco
You're my Coco
Ya, my Coco
