Motherfuckers get buzzed off the spice that I bring
Guess who's got the party jumpin'?
Glow in the dark rave, aura pumping
It's nice and different, yo fuck the the system
My system pumps off it's fucking face
Step into my world nou's jy tuis in paradys
Yo, word up to my brother, muis
Pump up your speakers, God se Jesus
Kyk wies rapping, lekker to the drum
These bad boys like to smack me in the bum
My crew's blowing up like Chappies bubble gum
Popping in your face, nya
Yo, fuck the rat race, my style is rap rave
My crew is kak fresh so who the fuck cares?
What you fucking think, I'm the type of chick
Who rolls with spif giftige misfits?

Yo my man DJ High Tek, shit, this motherfucking beat is nice!
Back in the day them dwankies didn't want to believe in us
Little did they know that they was in for da motherfucking big surprise
Left home locked in my Zef Zone
Ready for the test yo? What the fuck, I guess so
Hit the overseas, motherfucker's heads get blown
Get everything will be free like Dr. Dre Beats headphones
When I get home I lounge on my Zef throne

Make my mummy happy 'cause I get so paid

Making my money rapping over techno rave
I can take you 'round the world, let's go, babe

When I step up and do my thing I put you in a trance
My Zef motherfucking clique got it going on

Fuck what you think, I do what I want

I can make a million little motherfuckers jump
Jump motherfucker, jump motherfucker, jump
Jump motherfucker, jump motherfucker, jump

Jump motherfucker, jump motherfucker, jump
Jump motherfucker, jump motherfucker, jump
Increase the peace, don't wreck the party
And fuck da jol up for everybody
Ek's a laarney, jy's a gam

Want jy lam innie mang, met jou slang in a man
I fink u freeky and I like you a lot

Now why you loer en kyk gelyk?
Is ek miskien van goud gemake?
You want to fight, you come tonight
Ek moer jou sleg, so jy hardloop weg
God se Jesus, we come to party
Pump your speakers, yo rock your body
In God we trust, you can't fuck with us
We not taking kak, I'd like to say what's up
To my sexy boys and my fancy boys
And my playboys and my bad boys
And my pretty boys and my ugly boys
And my naughty boys, we gonna have a nice time, kids
