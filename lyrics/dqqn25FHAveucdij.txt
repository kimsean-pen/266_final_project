No one can take me out of this mess
I do it to myself
I lost my phone, my keys, what else?
The answer doesn't help
I'm paranoid as hell and I wanna
Go home but there's no place to run

Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer
In the heat of the summer

I've got to figure something out
But I don't know where to start
I found my keys under the couch
But I'm scared of going out
Having all these doubt and I'd rather
Stay home cuz there's no place to run

Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer

I'll be wasting time
In the sunshine
I'll be flying high
In the summer time
Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer
In the heat of the summer
