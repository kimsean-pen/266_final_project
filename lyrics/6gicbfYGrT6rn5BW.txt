Love is blind
as far as the eye can see
deep but meaningless
words to me
Easy lover
I need a friend
road to nowhere

twist and turns but will this never end
Well my dear you know that he pleases me
but short term solution ain't no resolution
there ain't no release for me

Too much of something is bad enough
but something's coming over me
to make me wonder
too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel
to keep me satisfied
Unwrap yourself from around my finger

hold me too tight or left to linger
something finebuilt to last slipped up there
I guess we're running out of time too fast
Yes my dear you know he soothes me

there's no complication there's no explanation
it's just a groove in me

Too much of something is bad enough
but something's coming over me
to make me wonder
too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel

to keep me satified
What part of no don't you understand
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can
boy who thinks he can

Too much of something is bad enough
but something's coming over me
to make me wonder
too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel
to keep me satisfied
Too much of something is bad enough
but something's coming over me
to make me wonder
too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel
to keep me satisfied
Too much of nothing
so why don't we give it a try
too much of something
you're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing
so why don't we give it a try
too much of something
you're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing
so why don't we give it a try
too much of something
you're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing
so why don't we give it a try
too much of something
you're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing
so why don't we give it a try
