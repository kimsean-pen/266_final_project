Give me your love, it's a curious love
Give me your heart, it's a curious thing
Our lady of the shipwreck is
Running thru the storm
Her skirts blown back, hands to the fore

My love and I go
It's a curious woe
Like dreamers at dawn
Awake but not yet
You give me your heart
It's a curious thing
Give me your love
It's a curious love

It burns and it slides
It's a curious ride
Give me your heart, yeah
Give me your heart
My love and I go
It's a curious woe

We're younger than clouds, younger than clouds

It burns and it slides
It's a curious ride
Give me your heart, yeah
Give me your heart
