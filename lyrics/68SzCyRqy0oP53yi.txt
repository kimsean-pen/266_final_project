When your tears are spent
On your last pretense
And your tired eyes refuse to close
And sleep in your defence
When it's in your spine
Like you've walked for miles
And the only thing you want it just to
Be still for a while

And if your heart wears thin
I will hold you up
And I will hide you
When it gets too much
I'll be right beside you
I'll be right beside you

When you're overwhelmed
And you've lost your breath
And the space between the things you know is blurring nonetheless
When you try to speak
But you make no sound
And the words you want are out of reach
But they've never been so loud

And if your heart wears thin
I will hold you up
And I will hide you
When it gets too much
I'll be right beside you
I'll be right beside you

I will stay (right beside...)
Nobody will break you

Trust in me
Trust in me
Don't pull away

Just trust in me
Trust in me
'Cause I'm just trying to keep this together
Because i could do worse and you could do better

When your tears are spent
On your last pretense
And your tired eyes refuse to close
And sleep in your defence

And if your heart wears thin
I will hold you up
And I will hide you
When it gets too much
I'll be right beside you
Nobody will break you

And if your heart wears thin
I will hold you up
And I will hide you
When it gets too much
I'll be right beside you
Nobody will break you
