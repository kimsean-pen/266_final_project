Bet you didn't notice
First time your heart was broken
You called me up and we talked till the morning, oh

And the time that you were stranded
I was there before you landed
He was a no show, I made sure you got home

And I've been right there (right there)
For every minute
This time, it's no different
Whatever happens you should know

'Cause you're not alone, girl
Look over your shoulder
You don't have to wonder
'Cause you know, you know, you know
You're not alone, girl
I'll be there to hold you
I'll stay till it's over
And you know, you know, you know
That you're not alone (you you you)

That you're not alone (you you you)
You're not alone

All the days that you were stressed out
Feeling like pulling your hair out
They were all missing but I was here listening (yeah)

You gotta believe in me
Even if you can't see me there (can't see me there)
I'll catch you when you fall, oh
'Cause I've been right there (right there)
For every minute
This time (oh), it's no different
Whatever happens you should know

'Cause you're not alone, girl
Look over your shoulder
You don't have to wonder
'Cause you know, you know, you know
You're not alone, girl
I'll be there to hold you

I'll stay till it's over
And you know, you know, you know
That you're not alone (you you you)
That you're not alone (you you you)
You're not alone

I'll be here for you no matter what comes around the corner
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
As long as I am breathing you won't have to worry no more

'Cause you're not alone, girl
Look over your shoulder
You don't have to wonder (you don't have to wonder)
'Cause you know, you know

'Cause you're not alone, girl
Look over your shoulder (yeah yeah)
You don't have to wonder
'Cause you know, you know, you know
You're not alone, girl
I'll be there to hold you
I'll stay till it's over (till it's over)
And you know, you know, you know
That you're not alone (you you you)
That you're not alone (you you you)
That you're not alone (you you you)
That you're not alone (you you you)
You're not alone
I bet you didn't notice
First time your heart was broken
You called me up and we talked till the morning
