I see you runnin'
Don't know what you're runnin' from
Nobody's comin'
What'd you do that was so wrong?

Look back and turn back
Look at yourself
Don't be afraid just
Look at yourself

If you need assistance
Or if all you need is love
There's no point in hiding
Tell me what your frightened of

You've got a friend just
Look at yourself
Don't be afraid just
Look at yourself

Look back and turn back
Look at yourself
Don't be afraid just
Look at yourself
