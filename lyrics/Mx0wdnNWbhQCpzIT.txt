Destruction
Has ruined your world
Flags of death
Have been unleashed
You've survived
And now you will die

Crawl through Hall
That once was your home
Search for help
Through despair that has grown
You've not lond
To live on this earth
You will die
Radiation shall kill

Shelter deep
Run and hide
There's no help
You will die
Shelter deep
Run and hide
There's no help
You will die

Fading fast
Your flesh shall rot
Life of pain
Is all you've got
There's no one left
To bury the dead
People hide
Behind walls of lead

Shelter deep
Run and hide
There's no help
You will die
Shelter deep
Run and hide
There's no help
You will die

Die, slow, death
Die, slow, death
Die, slow, death
Die, slow, death
