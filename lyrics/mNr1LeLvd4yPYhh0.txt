To mourn the end is to say goodbye
Not To yearn for that which we will never have again

We cry for our life together
because we know it will end
And we try to understand
how we could ever love again

Ohhhh, save your tears
at the end of our time
We've cried enough in our lives
just kiss my ashes goodbye
Kiss my ashes goodbye,
when i die kiss my ashes goodbye

Kiss my ashes goodbye We miss them so much now that they are gone
Took them for granted for living, so long

We read their words again,
and we listen to them again
as we start to understand,
what they were trying to say, all along

Ohhhh, save your tears
at the end of our time
We've cried enough in our lives
just kiss my ashes goodbye
Kiss my ashes goodbye
When i die kiss my ashes goodbye

Kiss my ashes goodbye Whoa!
Kiss my ashes goodbye
Whoa!
Just kiss my ashes goodbye

(PART 2)

Curse all those who were so vain
who felt entitled to hold a place on the earth as a grave for their remains
but no monument for me, please I am not one of them
I didn't need it in life, I wont need it in death

Whoa! Kiss my ashes goodbye

When words become irrelevant,
and you start to feel as though ... you've been misled
Keep me out of sight, leave me out of mind
when the thought no longer serves you
when I no longer serve you, just let the memories die (and move on)

Whoa! Kiss my ashes goodbye
Whoa! Kiss my ashes goodbye

Whoa! When i die, kiss my ashes goodbye
Whoa! When i die, kiss my ashes goodbye
