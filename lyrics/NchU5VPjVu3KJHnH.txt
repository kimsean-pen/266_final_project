Run-ing to Babylon
Run all the way to Babylon.
Need Jude
in Babylon

Need Jude...
in Babylon
Run-ing to Babylon
Run all the way to Babylon.

Need Jude
in Babylon
Need Jude...
in BABYLON!

Marooned again
you were the one
that threw me into life
Marooned again

you were the one
that looked through satalite

I liked the way we slept
our rooftops in the summertime
If we were all marooned again
I'd give my soul to save you.
Marooned again
you were the one
that put me in defence
Marooned again
you were the one who took my confidence
I liked the way we slept
on rooftops in the summertime
If we were all marooned again
I'd give my soul to save your life.
Run-ing from Babylon
Run all the way to Babylon
Need Jude in Babylon
Need Jude in Babylon
