it might make for good tv
the grieving process, for all to see
but i don't want my fathers ashes
scattered over strangers couches
and it might make for a fun night in if i
wore a dress and slept with him
but i really hate showing my legs
even when the sydney summer begs me
come on now, your roots are showing
unlike hands, your hair keeps growing
oh now love, you could keep on dying
i think the truth is more age defying
and in the day, when it turned dark
we were just two shelves apart
when we realized
it's not right
you are not in a garden
you are in a store
a single stemmed rose reaching
out for more
did it come as a great shock
when your third love said hey you're not
going to get his heart to beat by
laying offerings at his feet
and in the day when it turned dark
we were two cages apart
when we realized
it's not right
you are not in the wild
you are in a pen
a forgotten sow wondering when
you can
run
