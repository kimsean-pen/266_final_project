Breakdown
I can't take this
I need somewhere to go
I need you

I'm so restless
I don't know what to do
Cause we've had our rough times
Fighting all night
And now you're just slipping away

So give me this chance
To make the wrongs right, to say
Don't, don't, don't walk away
I promise
I won't let you down, you down
If you take my hand tonight
I promise

We'll be just fine this time
If you take my hand tonight

If you take my hand tonight
Without you I go through the motions
Without you it's just not quite the same
Without you I don't want to go out
I just wanted to say

That I'm sick of these fights
I'll let you be right
If it Stops you from running away

So just give me this chance
To make the wrongs and right to say
Don't, don't, don't walk away

I promise
I won't let you down, you down
If you take my hand tonight
I promise
We'll be just fine
This time
If you take my hand tonight
Take my hand

Take my hand
I promise
Take my hand
I promise
Take my hand
Go!

I promise
I won't let you down, you down
If you take my hand tonight
I promise
We'll be just fine
This time
If you take my hand tonight
If you take my hand tonight

I won't let you down
Take my hand tonight
