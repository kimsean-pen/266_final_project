What's it I haven't done?
Left me hanging alone
Looking for potential
In an empty prison

Keep the blame all to myself
Fear will bring me back to health
Endlessly, I turn upon
Problems that are not my own

I just want your good intentions
Unconditional, no question
Long to feel a real impression
But I just want you

I just want you
I just want you to say you're wrong

Cannot fix all your lies
Keeping love as a disguise
You're unwilling to see
Damage you lay daily

Keep the blame all to myself
Fear will bring me back to health
Endlessly, I turn upon
Problems that are not my own

I just want your good intentions
Unconditional, no question
Long to feel a real impression
But I just want you

I just want you
I just want you to say you're wrong

What's it I haven't done?
Left me hanging alone

I just want you
I just want you to say you're wrong
I just want you
I just want you to say you're wrong
