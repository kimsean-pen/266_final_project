Summertime and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.
All people in the dance will agree
That we're well qualified to represent the L.B.C.
G, me and Louie, we all run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder

Me and my girl, we got this relationship
I love her so bad, but she treats me like a ...
On lock down like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over
And when she gets home, there's none left for me

Summertime and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.
All people in the dance will agree
That we're well qualified to represent the L.B.C.
Me, me and Louie, we go run to the party
Dance to the rhythm, it gets harder

Oh, take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun will some day rise
What am I gonna be doin' for a while?
Said I'm gonna play with myself
Show them, now we've come off the shelf, so what?

Summertime, the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.
All people in the dance will agree
That we're well qualified to represent the L.B.C.
G, we and Louie, run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder

Evil, I've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely
Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely
The tension is getting hotter
I'd like to hold her head underwater

Me and my girl, we got a relationship
Me and my girl, we got a relationship
My girl, we got a relationship
Oh and my girl, we got a relation...

Take a tip, take a tip, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me

Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.
All people in the dance will agree
That we're well qualified to represent the L.B.C.
G, la la Louie, well everybody run to the rhythm, it gets harder

Summertime, the livin's easy
