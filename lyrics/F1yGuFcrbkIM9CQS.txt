Oh, oh, oh, Mexico
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Mexico
Oh, oh, oh, Mexico
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Mexico

Last night I had to leave the party
I don't know how to talk to you
With people watching
They don't know how it feels
To be afraid to touch, the one you want the most

Escape
(No puedo bailar con estos gringos locos)
We can't escape
(No puedo festejar con estos tontos gringos)

I want to love you a specific way
This is code for meet me in Mexico
I want you to love me a specific way
Can't we go down to Mexico

Oh, oh, oh, Mexico
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Mexico
Oh, oh, oh, Mexico
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Mexico

I lost my faith in everyone who leaves our side
I still believe in love in Guadalajara

Escape
(No puedo bailar con estos gringos locos)
We can't escape
(No puedo festejar con estos tontos gringos)

I want to love you a specific way
This is code for meet me in Mexico
I want you to love me a specific way
Can we go down to Mexico

Oh, oh, oh, Mexico
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Mexico
Oh, oh, oh, Mexico
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Mexico

I can't dance with these dumb americans
(No puedo bailar con estos gringos locos)
I can't party with these dumb americans
(No puedo festejar con estos tontos gringos)

I can't dance with these dumb americans
(No puedo bailar con estos gringos locos)
I can't party with these dumb americans
(No puedo festejar con estos tontos gringos)

I want to love you a specific way
This is code for meet me in Mexico
I want you to love me a specific way
Can we go down to Mexico

Oh, oh, oh, Mexico
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Mexico
Oh, oh, oh, Mexico
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Mexico
