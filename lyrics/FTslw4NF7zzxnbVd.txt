Loaded with dynamite
I don't give a fuck 'cause everybody die tonight
Call me negative, call me what you want
You are nothing, never was, never will

My hostility
My sanctuary
My reality
My sanctuary, underground

Coming with the storm
You wish you were never born
Fucked up reality
I'll take your soul and plant my seed

My hostility
My sanctuary
My reality
My sanctuary, underground

No excuses, no regrets
Everybody die tonight, everybody die tonight
No divisions, no turning back
Everybody die tonight, everybody die tonight

Sanctuary, sanctuary
Everybody die tonight, everybody die tonight
Sanctuary, sanctuary
Everybody die tonight, everybody die tonight
