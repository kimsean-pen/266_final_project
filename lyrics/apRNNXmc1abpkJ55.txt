When you're born in the dirt, the only way to grow is up
So we reach for the sun, but it seems
Every rung that you climb is another crooked line
That you cross off the tally of your dreams
Don't step out of line, kid, you learn it pretty fast
Every face has its place in the crowd
They'll give you all the answers, so you don't ask any questions
Then they'll march you with a smile into the ground
And we all go to heaven in a little row boat

So put your hands up, put your hands up
If crawling for the scraps won't ever be enough
Put your hands up, put your hands up
The writing's on the wall, this ain't ever gonna stop
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If crawling for the scraps won't ever be enough
Put your hands up, put your hands up
We'll fight until we die, this ain't ever gonna stop

This stray dog world, this sick sad place
Got a belly full of maggots and disease
Every apple here is rotten, every blessing is a curse
Every word is a lie you best believe
We take one step forward, then two steps back
In a race to the bottom of the barrel
They teach us how to fear, they teach us how to hate
Then they arm us, and they march us off to hell
And it's left, left, left, right, left

So put your hands up, put your hands up
If crawling for the scraps won't ever be enough
Put your hands up, put your hands up
The writing's on the wall, this ain't ever gonna stop
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If crawling for the scraps won't ever be enough
Put your hands up, put your hands up
We'll fight until we die, this ain't ever gonna stop
This ain't ever gonna stop

'Cause they came for our minds, we said nothing
They came for our hopes, we said nothing
They came for our souls, and still, we said nothing
Now they're coming for our lives, so what's it gonna take?
So what's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take? Oh
What's it gonna take?
See how they run, see how they run

So put your hands up, put your hands up
If clawing for the scraps won't ever be enough
Put your hands up, put your hands up
The writing's on the wall, this ain't ever gonna stop, yeah
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If clawing for the scraps won't ever be enough
Put your hands up, put your hands up
We'll fight until we die, this ain't ever gonna stop
