There are faces
There are smiles
So many teeth
Too many arms and legs and eyes
And flashing buttons all around me

Imma watching
Imma breathing
Imma pushing
Imma wishing that these walls would not be talking quite so loudly

I have bent down once before
I've fold myself up from the floor
And I am lolling for a reason to stay standing

But sometimes it's just too much
It's not enough
It's something else
It's so much bigger than my head
It's too demanding

Sometimes the fastest way to get there is to go slow
And sometimes if you wanna hold on you got to let go

I'm gonna close my eyes
And count to ten
I'm gonna close my eyes
And when I open them again
Everything will make sense to me then

I have met so many people
We've exchanged so many words
We've said it all and we said nothing
But it's changed us

I have known a lot of men
Some were lovers, some were friends
But altogether were they merely passing strangers

They control you with their silence
They control you with their words
And you control them with your bodies, call it signals

In the wild and tangled gardens of our insecurities
We lose our heads into each other's...?

Sometimes the fastest way to get there is to go slow
And sometimes if you wanna hold on you got to let go

I'm gonna close my eyes
And count to ten
I'm gonna close my eyes
And when I open them again
Everything will make sense to me then

Sometimes the fastest way to get there is to go slow
Yeah and sometimes if you wanna hold on you have to let go

I'm gonna close my eyes
And count to ten
I'm gonna close my eyes
And when I open them again
Everything will make sense to me then
