Day to day, it won't leave
Everytime, I try to speak

It consumes my mind
It consumes my soul
It wants my life it wants complete control
Somebody help me before it's bad
Somebody help me before I end up dead

I feel alone, all of the time
It's still quite, lurking inside
I'm a walking contradiction
Everything I say is an affliction to him
Somebody help me before it's bad
Somebody help me before I end up dead
