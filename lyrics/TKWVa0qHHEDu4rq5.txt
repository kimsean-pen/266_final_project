Precious moments
When will I see you again?
When will we share precious moments?
Will I have to wait forever?
Will I have to suffer (suffer)
And cry the whole night through?

When will I see you again?
When will our hearts beat together?
Are we in love or just friends?
Is this my beginning or is this the end?

When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?

(Precious moments)
Are we in love or just friends?
Is this my beginning or is this the end?

When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
Sweet, sweet love of mine
(When will I see you again?) Come on, come on
(When will I see you again?) Tell me, ya
(When will I see you again?) My sweet love, oh yes
(When will I see you again?) ooh, ya
(When will I see you again?) Come on, come on, hey hey hey
(When will I see you again?) Come on, come on, hey hey hey
