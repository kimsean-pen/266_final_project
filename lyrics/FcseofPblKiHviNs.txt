When you go please don't leave your love in the sun my heart would melt away
In the night with your twisted tongue when you drop the bomb I'm blown away
Cause I, refuse to hide in the page of the story
I, come out the box I won't say I'm sorry

We in the nuclear seasons, in the shelter I survived this road
We in the nuclear seasons, someone lovin' in the backseat gone

No facing this on my own 'cause you taste the blast and it shook your bones
I worry you're all alone, in the field of lies, I won't go home
Cause I, didn't burn my skin in the blaze of glory
I, come out your hands I won't say I'm sorry

We in the nuclear seasons in the shelter I survived this road
We in the nuclear seasons someone lovin' in the backseat gone

We survived nuclear seasons X2

I can feel it, I can feel the fear
I can feel it, inside of her soul
Inside of the soul

We in the nuclear seasons in the shelter I survived this road
We in the nuclear seasons someone lovin' in the backseat gone

We survived nuclear seasons X4
