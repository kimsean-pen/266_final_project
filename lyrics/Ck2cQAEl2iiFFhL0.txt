I sit here counting the days
It starts to weigh so heavily
And these thoughts keep running around my head
As I keep spinning and spinning
You have to chose;
Does this path from the past mean the world to you?
On time, too late or too soon
Will you be ready for your vision when it comes true?

Voracious, and you're out of your mind
Always grabbing onto things that'll eat you alive
It's not the first proposition, it's the best
Everything is a test, everything is a test
You don't know who you're talking to
I'll destroy your life and blame it on you
And as you think it stands, you're dead without me, so I can
You don't understand

I'm stepping back from what I know is the truth
I just don't feel the way I used to
I'd turn my back if you would follow me
We could just run away, we could just run away

I feel like I'm obsessed
When I'm torn apart is when I'm at my best
I'm not good at faking where I wanna be
It's my heart or my sanity
Stuck in your head
Going over the things that you should've said
On time, too late or too soon
Will you be ready for your vision when it comes true?
Cause when it does, it'll swallow you

Cause when it does, it'll swallow you
I fear the burden of truth

Voracious, and you're out of your mind
Always grabbing onto things that'll eat you alive
It's not the first proposition, it's the best
Everything is a test, everything is a test
You don't know who you're talking to
I'll destroy your life and blame it on you
And as you think it stands, you're dead without me, so I can
You don't understand

I'm stepping back from what I know is the truth
I just don't feel the way I used to
I'd turn my back if you would follow me
We could just run away, we could just run away

Let them promise you the world, but don't you take it
Cause when you give them what they ask
They'll turn their backs
(It's a sham!)

A sham, a sham, it's all a fucking sham
Turn away and run from this as fast as you can
A sham, a sham, it's all a fucking sham
Don't let them force you to become their hand
Don't let this slip through your hands
Don't let this slip through
Don't let this slip through your hands
Don't let this slip through
Don't let this slip through your hands
Don't let this slip through your hands!
