Hey Pedro, where we goin'?
(I don't know)
Turn on that flashlight
I... I think I'm kissin' your sister

Early in the mornin', and I can't get it right
Had a little date with my baby last night
Now it's early in the mornin'
Ooh, in the mornin'
Early in the mornin', and I ain't got nothin' but the blues

Went to all the places that we used to go
Went to his house, but he don't live there no more
Early in the mornin' (Early in the mornin')
Ooh, in the mornin' (Early in the mornin')
Early in the mornin', and I ain't got nothin' but the blues

Went to his best friend's house, but he was out
Knocked on his mother's door, and she began to shout
'Scat, alley cat' in the mornin' (Early in the mornin')
Ooh, in the mornin'
Yeah, it's early in the mornin', and I ain't got nothin' but the blues

Went to Doogy Chase to get somethin' to eat
The waitress looked at me and said, 'Ma, you look beat.'
Now it's early in the mornin' (Early in the mornin', baby)
Ooh, in the mornin'
Yeah, it's early in the mornin', and I ain't got nothin' but the blues

Oh, I had a lot of money when I started out
Couldn't find my baby and now my money's run out
Now it's early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin' (Early in the mornin')
Ooh, in the mornin' (Early in the mornin')
Early in the mornin', and I ain't got nothin' but the blues

Early in the mornin' (Early in the mornin')
Early in the mornin' (Early in the mornin')
Early in the mornin' (Early in the mornin')
Yeah, early in the mornin'

Hey! Pedro, wait up! (Alright)
Watch out.
What you doin'? (I don't know)
