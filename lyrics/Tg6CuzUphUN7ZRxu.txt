When can my heart beat again?
When does the pain ever end?
When do the tears stop from running over
When does, "You'll get over it" begin?

I hear what you're saying
But I swear that it's not making sense
So when can I see you

When can I see you again?
When can my heart beat again?
When can I see you again?
When can I breathe once again?
And when can I see you?

When does my someday begin?
When I'll find someone again
And what if I still am not truly over
What am I supposed to do then, babe?

Do you see what I'm saying
Even if, if it's not making sense?
So when can I see you?

When can I see you again?
When can my heart beat again?
When can I see you again?
And when can I breathe once again?
And when can I see you again?

Yeah, baby
Do you see what I'm saying
Even if, if it's not making sense, baby?
So when can I see you again?

When can I see you again?
Can my heart beat again, baby?
When can I see you again?
And when can I breathe once again?
And when can I see, babe, again?
Wanna see you again
Again
