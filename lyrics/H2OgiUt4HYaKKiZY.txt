No one knows where the ladder goes
You're gonna lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique in dying

I feel estranged every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I want to fly in your silver ship
Let Jesus hang and Buddha sit

It's on now
The days are long now
The ups and the sundowns
And a twisting mind

If I got to go first
I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors
Always changing sides
They were friends of mine

Don't hang around once the promise breaks
Or you'll be there when the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
Some imagined freedom

All the rest is predictable
You can say you're the first to know
Bought a mantra to concentrate
Car alarm or hissing snake

I know now
How its gonna turn out
You've got to calm down
Or I'll lose my place

Got to get to the center
Got to get to the concert
Run off with a dancer
Gonna celebrate

We'll welcome the New Age
Covered in warrior paint
Lights from the jungle to the sky
See now a star is born
Looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you want to cry?
Precious friend of mine

Will I know when it's finally done?
This whole life is a hallucination
You're not alone in anything
You're not alone in trying to be
