She makes my shoulders deflate
Won't ever see me standing up straight
Strawberry split personality, she's got so many
Years hanging over me

I would not wait
I would not wait
If I were you
I would have chosen her too

You'll end up calling her babe
She's scorching hot enough to hit save
Never forgave what she did to me
All dolled up, actin' like a bitch would be

Couldn't behave
She just couldn't behave
But if I were you
I would have chosen her too

Do you think she feels like she's being watched?
Maybe not
But baby, when the music stops all you got
Is a risky photo
Bathroom mirror moment, bozo
Smoke show
She's fine
Perfect kissing height
Yeah, she suits you alright
But I won't stop until you're mine

No, I won't stop until you're mine
But I won't stop until you're mine
No, I won't stop until you're mine
