I am the truth fuck it
I'm breaking it down what I do
Skipping the sentences I'll never use
Break off the tendency's
Pulling me through

I got rich fast, my bitch she bad
I keep my wallet and image intact
Mental intact, stuck on my past
Really been plotting to get where I am
I got rich fast, my bitch she bad
I keep my wallet and image intact
Mental intact, stuck on my past
Really been plotting to get where I am
But, I feel so sad
I'm loving everything I'm doing
But, I feel so sad
I'm loving everything I'm doing

Okay scar come then please tell us the game
Tell us you hate all the fame um yeah
You think you know bout my brain
This is the craziest place uh yeah
Nobody out here can better me
Sometimes I live in ecstasy
The shit that they talk it don't get to me
Me and myself are still enemies
Give a fuck what you think
Gonna be the illist in a minute
These days I'm tripping and tripping
Double the dose I was given
Woulda, coulda, shoulda with the business shit
I take time and heal quick
Realize the shit I win
Hide inside those place you think
I despise those hateful things

I got rich fast, my bitch she bad
I keep my wallet and image intact
Mental intact, stuck on my past
Really been plotting to get where I am
I got rich fast, my bitch she bad
I keep my wallet and image intact
Mental intact, stuck on my past
Really been plotting to get where I am
But, I feel so sad
I'm loving everything I'm doing
But, I feel so sad
I'm loving everything I'm doing

It still feels like I'm in anguish
It still feels like I'm in pain
I feel so sad (So sad, yeah)
I feel so sad (Hey, hey, wait wait wait)

I got rich fast, my bitch she bad
I keep my wallet and image intact
Mental intact, stuck on my past
Really been plotting to get where I am
I got rich fast, my bitch she bad
I keep my wallet and image intact
Mental intact, stuck on my past
Really been plotting to get where I am
But, I feel so sad
I'm loving everything I'm doing
But, I feel so sad
I'm loving everything I'm doing
