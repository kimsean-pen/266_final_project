The river opened her mouth and spat into a vast sea larger
And bluer than a cloudless sky.
Muscular, prodigious, immortal.
But our vessel was invulnerable.
It was well built, the boat rocked me into sleep
And I floated through a deep dream, smooth sailing through the castle in the air

One-eyed people living peaceful
With monopods and astomia
Without malice or guile
Without covetousness

Ohh, ahh

And there's men whose heads do
Grow beneath their shoulders
Maybe we'll find the world's center
Where equinox does not shatter
Spread our teaching
Alleviate their damnation

Ohh, ahh
Ohh, ahh

Without us they will go to hell
We are casting spells

Could it be
Faithful?
Could it seem
More real?
As I opened my eyes
The dream decolourised
Until it was un-skewered
And the harsh reality hit me like salty water
