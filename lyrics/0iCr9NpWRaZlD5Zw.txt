Save me now
before my world falls
Save me now
from myself
before the dawn

Save me now
before my world falls
Save me now
from myself
before the dawn

Save me now
I'm at the reaper's door
Can't you see
you hold the key
to set my mind free...

Save me now
I'm at the reaper's door
Can't you see
you hold the key
to set my mind free...
