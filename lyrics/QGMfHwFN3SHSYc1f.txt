Tell me who I'm supposed to be now
Make me better
I can't stay halfway dead forever

Can you fix this, am I too far gone?
I've never done this before
Don't know if I'm ready but I wanna move on
And I've never said that before

I don't wanna be stuck, I don't wanna be crazy
This is the way that my sadness made me
Better come quick, yeah better come save me

I don't wanna be stuck, I don't wanna be crazy
This is the way that my sadness made me
Better come quick, yeah better come save me

Tell me, tell me

Tell me who I'm supposed to be now
Make me better
I can't stay halfway dead forever
I fear now
There's not much left of me
When you take the sick away
Who am I supposed to be?
Who am I supposed to be?

Recovery time, a condition like mine
What are we talking here?
Getting so close, I can taste the hope
But I still feel the fear

I don't wanna be stuck, I don't wanna be crazy
This is the way that my sadness made me
Better come quick, yeah better come save me

I don't wanna be stuck, I don't wanna be crazy
This is the way that my sadness made me
Better come quick, yeah better come save me

Tell me who I'm supposed to be now
Make me better
I can't stay halfway dead forever
I fear now
There's not much left of me
When you take the sick away
Who am I supposed to be?
Who am I supposed to be?

For years, this is all I've known, this has had my heart, this has been my home
And now I'm scared to lose myself, scared of letting go

For years, this is all I've known, this has had my heart, this has been my home
And now I'm scared to lose myself, scared of letting go

Tell me who I'm supposed to be now
Make me better
I can't stay halfway dead forever
I fear now
There's not much left of me
When you take the sick away
Who am I supposed to be?
Tell me who I'm supposed to be
Tell me who I'm supposed to be
