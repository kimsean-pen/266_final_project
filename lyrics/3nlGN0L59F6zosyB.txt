Fire and the ice colliding
I wanna go deep and dive in
It's heaven on Earth but hell of a night
To melt into one
She's never been afraid of sirens
Head down but keep drivin'
Damn we might crash moving so fast but baby

Don't stop, I need it
Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
My heart beating
Your touch
It thrills me to the bone
Oh Lord! Forgive us
Alas, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love
Nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough
Nothing can stop it, oh

Darkness and light, streaming
The end of our life beginning
No longer alone, my will become gone
We melt into one
Both hands on the floor, you go low
Who was I before? I don't know
And who am I now? Your body shows how
The past just has no meaning

Don't stop, I need it
Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
My heart bleeding
Your touch
It thrills me to the bone
Oh Lord! Forgive us
Alas, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love
Nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough
Nothing can stop it, oh!

Yeah

Oh, oh!
Don't stop, I need it
Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
My heart bleeding
Your touch
It thrills me to the bone
Oh Lord! Forgive us
Alas, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love
Nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough
Nothing can stop it
