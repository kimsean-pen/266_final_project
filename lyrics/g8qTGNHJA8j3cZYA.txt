Ooh ooh ooh
Has it been a day or a week?
As my eyes begin to close
I am walking in my sleep

Living in a state in-between
Do the signs begin to show
See the eyes, there in the dark
As they glow
As they glow

These dreams under my pillow
In the twilight of these white nights
these dreams under my pillow
In the bright light of these white nights

Of these white nights
Of these white nights
Of these white nights

Ooh ooh ooh
Something is about to be born
There's a restlessness in me
Keeps me up until the dawn
There is no silence
I will keep following the sirens
There is no silence
I will keep following the sirens

These dreams under my pillow
In the twilight of these white nights
these dreams under my pillow
In the bright light of these white nights

Of these white nights
Of these white nights
Of these white nights

These dreams under my pillow
In the twilight of these white nights
these dreams under my pillow
In the bright light of these white nights

Of these white nights
Of these white nights
Of these white nights
