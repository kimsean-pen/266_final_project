Still feels like our first night together
Feels like the first kiss
It's getting better baby
No one can better this...
Still holding on
You're still the one

First time our eyes met
Same feeling I get
Only feels much stronger
Wanna love you longer
You still turn the fire on...

So if you're feeling lonely, don't
You're the only one I ever want
I only wanna make it good
So if I love you a little more than I should

Please forgive me, I know not what I do
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
Don't deny me, this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me, if I need you like I do
Please believe me, every word I say is true
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you

Still feels like our best times are together
Feels like the first touch
Still getting closer baby
Can't get closer enough...
I'm still holding on
You're still number one
I remember the smell of your skin
I remember everything
I remember all your moves
I remember you yeah!
I remember the nights, you know I still do...

So if you're feeling lonely, don't
You're the only one I ever want
I only wanna make it good
So if I love you a little more than I should

Please forgive me, I know not what I do
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
Don't deny me, this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me, if I need you like I do
Oh believe me, every word I say is true
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
Yeah oh oh yeah!

The one thing I'm sure of
Is the way we make love
The one thing I depend on
Is for us to stay strong
With every word and every breath I'm praying
That's why I'm saying...

Please forgive me, I know not what I do
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
Don't deny me, this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me, if I need you like I do
Babe, believe me, every word I say is true
Please forgive me, if I can't stop loving you
Never leave me, I don't know what I do
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
