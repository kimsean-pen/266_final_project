You miss me?
I miss all of y'all
All of you girls standin' together like that, I can't take it (uhn)

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey) Women,
I can do anything you like
I can do anything you need
And I got a better body
Than the magazines you read
None of them boys know the first thing about your fantasy
And if they tried, they can not do it just like me

I know you certainly been gone
And it's been much too long
And there's some things we need to do
So I know you need to get home

Come get it bae (hey, c'mon)
Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey, c'mon)
Come get it bae (hey)
You wanna ride it, my motorcycle
You've got a license, but you got the right to
Gonna pop a wheelie, don't try too high too
Take it easy on the clutch (hey!), cause girl I like you (wait man, heey-o)

I can see it the way you like
I can do anything you need
I can give you dirty looks
Like them niggas that's on T.V
None of them boys know the first thing about your fantasy
And if they tried, they can not do it just like me

I know you certainly been gone
And it's been much too long
And there's some things we need to do
So I know you need to get home

Come get it bae (hey, c'mon)
Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey, c'mon)
Come get it bae (hey)
You wanna ride it, my motorcycle
You've got a license, but you got the right to
Gonna pop a wheelie, don't try too high too
Take it easy on the clutch, cause girl I like you (hey, heeey)

There comes a time (comes a time), the craving will grab your wrist
You'll need a sugar fix, ba-aby
There comes a time (comes a time), and you won't believe what you'll do
When that sugar's callin' you
Girl, there will come a time (sugar, sugar), this is where you wanna be
H-O-M-E, (sugar, sugar) satisfaction guaranteed
And there will come (sugar, sugar) a time, this is where you wanna be
Cause it's (sugar, sugar) everything you need, you will only find in me

Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey, c'mon)
Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey, c'mon)
Come get it bae (hey)
You wanna ride it, my motorcycle
You've got a license, but you got the right to
Gonna pop a wheelie, don't try too high too
Take it easy on the clutch, cause girl I like you (hey, heeey)

Hey (wait man), hey (wait man), hey (wait man), hey (wait man), hey (wait man), hey (wait man), hey (wait man), hey...
