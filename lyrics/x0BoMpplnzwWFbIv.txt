Get the feeling, head is reeling
You think you're in control but you don't know me babe
I can move you, I can soothe you
I can take you places in a different way

And I don't think you understand
What I'm trying to say
I'll be your operator baby
I'm in control

Watch your action, close reaction
And everything you're thinking babe inside your head
Conversation, my creation
Nothing that you do you do unless I said

And you don't know the consequences
Of the things you say
I'll be your operator baby
I'm in control

All the things you tried to do babe
And all the words we've said before
Are only part of what I started baby
And you can't stop me anymore

Get the feeling, head is reeling
You think you're in control but you don't know me babe
I can move you, I can soothe you
I can take you places in a different way

And I don't think you understand
What I'm trying to say
I'll be your operator baby
I'm in control
