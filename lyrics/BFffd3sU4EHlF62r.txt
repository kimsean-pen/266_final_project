Are you proud of this since you ruined it?
I'm so fucking tired of you
So emotionless, something I can't fix
And I'm just way too good for you

I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, babe
I'm not gonna fake it, tell you we gon' make it
You can wipe that smile right off your face
Always playin' victim, figured out your system
Yeah

And I hate your tattoos and your hair and your car and your clothes
And I hate when you're drinking
'cause that's when you fuck up the most
And I hate that I gave you a chance
when I know that you're not what I want

And I can't sugarcoat it, coat it
No I, I, I, I, I, I can't
No I, I, I, I, I, I can't
And I can't sugarcoat it, coat it
No, I can't sugarcoat it, coat it

Pull over right now, I can't keep this down
I'm so fucking tired of you
All those things I loved will never make up
For that shit you put me through

I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, babe
I'm not gonna fake it, tell you we gon' make it
You can wipe that smile right off your face
Always playin' victim, figured out your system
Yeah

And I hate your tattoos and your hair and your car and your clothes
And I hate when you're drinking
'cause that's when you fuck up the most
And I hate that I gave you a chance
when I know that you're not what I want

And I can't sugarcoat it, coat it
No I, I, I, I, I, I can't
No I, I, I, I, I, I can't
And I can't sugarcoat it, coat it
No, I can't sugarcoat it, coat it

I can't keep up with all your lies and
You say the same shit every time and
I've got all of you so memorized and
You say the same shit every time

I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, babe
I'm not gonna fake it, tell you we gon' make it
You can wipe that smile right off your face
Always playin' victim, figured out your system
Yeah

And I hate your tattoos and your hair and your car and your clothes
And I hate when you're drinking
'cause that's when you fuck up the most
And I hate that I gave you a chance
when I know that you're not what I want

And I can't sugarcoat it, coat it
No I, I, I, I, I, I can't
No I, I, I, I, I, I can't
And I can't sugarcoat it, coat it
No, I can't sugarcoat it, coat it
