Just the thought of another day
How did we end up this way
What did we do wrong?
God

Even though the days go on
So far, so far away from
It seems so close

Always weighing on my shoulder
A time like no other
It all changed on that day
Sadness and so much pain

You can touch the sorrow here
I don't know what to blame
I just watch and watch again

Even though the days go on
So far, so far away from
It seems so close

Even though the days go on
So far, so far away from
It seems so close

What did it leave behind?
What did it take from us and wash away?
It may be long
But with our hearts start a new
And keep it up and not give up
With our heads held high

You have seen hell and made it back again
How to forget?
We can't forget
The lives that were lost along the way
And then you realise that wherever you go
There you are
Time won't stop
So we keep moving on

Yesterday's night turns to light
Tomorrow's night returns to light
Be the light

Always weighing on my shoulder
A time like no other
It all changed on that day
Sadness and so much pain

Anyone can close their eyes
Pretend that nothing is wrong
Open your eyes
And look for light

What did it leave behind?
What did it take from us and wash away?
It may be long
But with our hearts start a new
And keep it up and not give up
With our heads held high

You have seen hell and made it back again
How to forget?
We can't forget
The lives that were lost along the way
And then you realise that wherever you go
There you are
Time won't stop
So we keep moving on

Yesterday's night turns to light
Tomorrow's night returns to light
Be the light

Some days just pass by and
Some days are unforgettable
We can't choose the reason why
But we can choose what to do from the day after
So with that hope, with that determination
Let's make tomorrow a brighter and better day
