I've got a candle
And I've got a spoon
I live in a hallway with no doors and no rooms
Under the window sill they all was found
A touch of concrete within a doorway
Without a sound

Someone save me if you will
And take away all these pills
And please just save me, if you can
From the blasphemy in my wasteland

How did I get here
And what went wrong
Couldn't handle forgiveness
Now I'm far beyond gone
And I can hardly remember the look of my own eyes
How could I love this
My life's so dishonest
It made me compromise

Someone save me if you will
And take away all these pills
And please just save me, if you can
From the blasphemy in my wasteland

Jump in the water
Jump in with me
Jump on the altar
Lay down with me
My hardest question to answer is why

Someone save me if you will
And take away all these pills
And please just save me, if you can
From the blasphemy in my wasteland

Some one save me
Some one save me
Somebody save me
Somebody save me
Please don't erase me
