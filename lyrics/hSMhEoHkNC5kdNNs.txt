One two, one two
Tell me what you want to
One two, one two
Do you really want

Friday, my way
Ridin' on a highway
Woke up in L.A
It's a hella party
Hell's gate
All placed
Rabbits in the hallway
Jumpin' till the end of times
It's a hella party

Voice of hell, voice of hell
Voice of hell, voice of hell
Hell is fucking lit
(Hell is fucking lit)
Party, party, there's no end
(Party, party, there's no end)
Hell is fucking lit
(Hell is fucking lit)
Party, party, there's no end
(Voice of hell, voice of hell)
Hell is fucking lit
(Hell is fucking lit)
Party, party, there's no end
(Party, party, there's no end)
Hell is fucking lit
(Hell is fucking lit)
Party, party, there's no end
(Voice of hell, voice of hell)

Wonderland
Underground
Dead boys and princes all around
Wonderland
Want to round
You've just make it to the [?]

All day, all play
Everybody knows me
Wanna get to party in
And nobody wants pain
That face
A place
Folded to his damn brain
Better come back in hell
It's a hella party

Welcome to hella party
Motherfucker

Hell is fucking lit
(Hell is fucking lit)
Party, party, there's no end
(Party, party, there's no end)
Hell is fucking lit
(Hell is fucking lit)
Party, party, there's no end
(Voice of hell, voice of hell)
Hell is fucking lit
(Hell is fucking lit)
Party, party, there's no end
(Party, party, there's no end)
Hell is fucking lit
(Hell is fucking lit)
Party, party, there's no end
(Voice of hell, voice of hell)
