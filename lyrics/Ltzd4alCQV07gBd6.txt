Prophecy of Ragnarök
Twillight of the Gods
No escaping Destiny when Baldur's gone

Snow and Ice will freeze the world. Mountains crack
Fenrir's fetters is no more
The Sky is turning black

Prophecy of Ragnarök
Legend of our Death
Time to be corroded by the Serpent's Breath
Riding through the Wastelands
There is Fire everywhere
The Gods won't be around to hear our final Prayer

AXE TIME, SWORD TIME
Gods go under
WIND TIME, WOLF TIME
Death to all
AXE TIME, SWORD TIME
Shields are sundered
WIND TIME, WOLF TIME
Worlds will fall

Titans of justice
Fearless we stand
Odin allfather are we blessed by your hand

Together we rise
Together we fight

We ride into battle and into the night

The giants are raging
The Gods meet their fate
The Heavens crack open
Thunder fall through the land

Guardian of Bifrost is blowing his Horn
We ride into battle and into the storm

Brothers they be fighting
Together side by side
Valkyries assembling
As Aegir brings the tide

In Odin's Hall we gather champions from th past
Warriors of Valhalla we will die at last

Everything's devoured by the rushing of waves
The bottom of the ocean
Will be our Graves

Mountains clash together under
Yggdrasil
Crumbling to pieces and sink into the Sea

AXE TIME, SWORD TIME
Gods go under
WIND TIME, WOLF TIME
Death to all
AXE TIME, SWORD TIME
Shields are sundered
WIND TIME, WOLF TIME
Worlds will fall

Titans of justice
Fearless we stand
Odin allfather are we blessed by your hand

Together we rise
Together we fight

We ride into battle and into the night

The giants are raging
The Gods meet their fate
The Heavens crack open
Thunder fall through the land

Guardian of Bifrost is blowing his Horn
We ride into battle and into the storm

A perfect darkness follows all
A perfect silence to end the war
Oh, Ginnungagap, Oh bottomless Abyss
It's the ultimate nothingless where death is bliss

(AXE TIME, SWORD TIME)
Warriors of Valhalla
(WIND TIME, WOLF TIME)
Hear my final words
(AXE TIME, SWORD TIME)
This is our purpose
(WIND TIME, WOLF TIME)
This is our end.

AXE TIME, SWORD TIME

WIND TIME, WOLF TIME

AXE TIME, SWORD TIME

WIND TIME, WOLF TIME

WORLDS WILL FALL!
