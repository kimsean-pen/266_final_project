Promise me
Outside in the trees
They're waiting tonight

Promise me
While the searching light
Moon has found me

Know it feels like
The last time again

Promise me
Someone who will promise me
Stand in the dark and fight like me

Through eyes like fireflies
Turn around and tell me
It'll be alright
Is it alright?

Promise me
Don't cheat my soul
When it returns to me

Promise me
Give me the vision
I was born to see

You know it feels like years since
They burned me away
You know feels like years since
Turned my heart away

Yeah, it feels like years
Feels like years
Feels like years since
Took my eyes away
