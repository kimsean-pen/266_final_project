I hear the sound of falling love
As I wonder where you are
Hits the ground with a dead sound
Know you ain't got far
You're too stupid and sissy-like
To say that you want out
You make the eyes of a million girls
And think you'll make them shout

Dead sound
Dead sound
Dead sound
Dead sound

I used to take you on every time
That sparkle turned to black
I used to drag you through my streets
When you came crawling back
Your cheap words that you bought on sale
Won't help you through tonight
You make the eyes of a million girls
And think that's what they like

Dead sound
Dead sound
Dead sound
Dead sound

And now you go through a million girls
And try to pick what's right
When nightfall comes and you're still alone
Do you feel it deep inside?
It's oh-so-cold on the other side
Where your thoughts can turn you down
You make the eyes of a million girls
But I see no girl around

Dead sound
Dead sound
Dead sound
Dead sound
