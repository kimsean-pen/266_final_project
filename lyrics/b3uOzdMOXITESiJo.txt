Lie alone and listen to your thoughts
Calm is empty, desolate and blue
There's a war upon the burning heart
Ease your mind before the truth

Let's drift
Drift in
Let's drift, yeah
Drift in
Oh

Underneath the glowing moon
Blood is dripping, burning red
Where there's a stillness in the mind
Fall asleep and count your dead

Drift
Drift in
Let's drift
Drift in

Yeah, I don't wanna live with knowing we were told to stay the same
Yeah, I don't wanna live with knowing we were told to stay (Stay!)

Let's drift
Drift in, yeah
Let's drift
Drift in

(Drift!) Wide awake you save your speech
(Drift in) Yeah, I can sense a common thread
(Let's drift) There's a war beyond the reach
(Drift in) Fall asleep and count your dead

Oh

Drift
Drift in (oh)
Let's drift
Drift in
(Drift) Fall asleep and count your dead
(Drift in) Fall asleep and count your dead
(Let's Drift) Fall asleep and count your dead
(Drift in) Fall asleep and count (count)
