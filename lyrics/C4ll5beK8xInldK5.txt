silently i fall asleep
with you kneeling beside me holding me
secretly this feels right to me
you're my wonderful heaven sent down to me
we turn our backs to end of time
so we can let the moment stay
hold my hand through the thick and thin
as we remember to hold the faith
offer me a love so deep
show me the beauty in all you see
secretly this feels right to me
you're my wonderful heaven sent down to me
there's nobody here now beauty above all.
