Seems I've got to have a change of scene
Every night I have the strangest dreams
Imprisoned by the way it could have been
Left here on my own or so it seems
I've got to leave before I start to scream
But someone locked the door and took the key

Feelin' alright
Not feelin' too good myself
Feelin' alright
Not feelin' too good myself

Boy you sure took me for one big ride
Even now I sit and wonder why?
That when I think of you I start myself to cry
I just can't waste my time, I must keep dry
Got to stop believin' in all your lies
'Cause there's too much to do before I die

Feelin' alright
Not feelin' too good myself
Feelin' alright
Not feelin' too good myself

Don't get too lost is all I say
By the time you know I really felt that way
But that was then and now you know it's today
I can't just get off 'cause I'm here to stay
'Til someone comes along and takes my place
With a different name and a different face

Feelin' alright
Not feelin' too good myself
Feelin' alright
Yeah, alright
Oh, not, not feelin' too good myself

Yes, I'm feelin' alright
Oh, not feelin' too good myself
