Oh!
This is the sonnet of the wretched.
Can you hear their screams?
Your prayers won't be heard.
They will rise.
When daylight dies they come and bring an abrupt end to your sinful life.
There's nothing you can do to stop them now, it's too late.
Just run and hide and hope they will never find you until it's over and they're gone.
You think this is hell? You don't know the half of it
And this is just the beginning of the end for you
There's nothing sacred here, everything you once loved has been defiled
There's only pain and sorrow.
They bring the end
And there's nothing that can save you from this cruel fate
But it's your fault, it is you that brought them
They felt the presence of your blackened heart
And smelt the stench of your abject existence
They've come to cleanse your soul of its affliction
You can't repent because it's far too late.
Oh, just wait until they have you in their grasp
Now you will feel what it's like to be in hell
And your only company will be the horde
This is now the end your soul is cleansed your mouth is stitched your eyes are blind.
And your blackened heart ceases to beat anymore
Now they have gone. Disappeared without a trace.
This is the sonnet of the wretched.
Your soul is cleansed your mouth is stitched your eyes are blind.
This is the sonnet of the wretched.
Did you hear their screams?
Your prayers were not heard.
They have cleansed all sin and evil
Lay to rest.
