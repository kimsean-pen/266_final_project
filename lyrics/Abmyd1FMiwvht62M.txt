The time is nigh
I follow
all the echoes reciting to me
I'll read the sky
and follow
the footsteps my enemies left for me

This is the sound, this is the sound, this is the sound hear me shout it out loud

Challenge me to the death
with my feet stuck to the ground
How can we cherish our inner demons
without shouting it, letting it, fighting it out

Challenge me 'til the early dawn
with my hands tied at the back
I know I'll bring you down
to your knees at last
Crying mercy, mercy, have mercy

I can't deny you're hollow
and I can't wait to bring you down
Delights my eyes
your sorrow
And feeds my old ever so vengeful heart

This is the sound, this is the sound, this is the sound of you hitting the ground
This is the sound, shout it out loud, shout it, shout it, shout it out loud

Challenge me to the death
with my feet stuck to the ground
How can we cherish our inner demons
without shouting it, letting it, fighting it out

Challenge me to the death
with my feet stuck to the ground
How can we cherish our inner demons
without shouting it, letting it, fighting it out

Challenge me 'til the early dawn
with my hands tied at the back
I know I'll bring you down
to your knees at last
Crying mercy, mercy, have mercy on me
