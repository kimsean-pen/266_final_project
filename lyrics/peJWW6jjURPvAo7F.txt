Beneath a gauze of laced desire
I tread softly in 9-inch heels
And I sink down into your chest
A knifed stiletto
None of this is for decoration

Thru all I've spoken
All I've awoken
Still, you don't understand me
You don't understand

Baby if you come too soon
I'll choke out the breath of light
I do this because I trust you with creation
But I will abort your dedication

A serpent coils around my neck
As pisces swims up and down
Martini and misanthropy is what I live for
The only thing that keeps me from going insane

There's a wolf inside of me
I feel it clawing at my insides
It's time for you to leave
You best start running
I feel blood lust coming

A hearts not open until it's broken
Still, you don't understand me
You don't understand
You don't understand me
You don't understand

Kali's invocation, bunny's initiation
Kali's invocation, bunny's initiation
Kali's invocation, bunny's initiation
Kali's invocation, bunny's initiation

You don't understand me
You don't understand
You don't understand me
You don't understand
You don't understand me
You don't understand
