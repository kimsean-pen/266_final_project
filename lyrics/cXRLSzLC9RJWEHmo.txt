Into that darkness
Into that darkness
Like jackals howling
Like flowers unfolding

Into that darkness
Into that darkness
The banners in tatters
The virgin is blessed

Into that darkness
Into that darkness
As if seeking there
Hope's bloody prey
The dead dog sinking
Turning and turning

Into that darkness
Into that darkness
The bodies collapsed
Swollen with gas

Into that darkness
Into that darkness
In the hovels and gutters
Her face to the storm

Into that darkness
Into that darkness
Still broken, still bleeding
The crack of the neck
The gut shriek of thunder
The blood call of lightning

She said destroy in black New York...

Into that darkness
Into that darkness
Like jackals howling
Like flowes unfolding

Into that darkness
Into that darkness
The virgin has blessed
The call of the beast

Into that darkness
Into that darkness
As if seeking there
Hope's bloody prey
The dead dog sinking
Turning and turning

She said destroy in black New York...
