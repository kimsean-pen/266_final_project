Now when the day goes to sleep and the full moon lurks
And the night is so black that the darkness cooks
And you come creeping around
Making me do things I don't want to do

I can't believe that she needs my love so bad
You come sneaking around trying to drive me mad
Busting in all my dreams
Making me see things I don't want to see

'Cause you're the Green Manalishi
With the two-pronged crown
All night dragging us up
Or you're bringing us down
Just taking my love, and slip away
Leaving me here trying to keep from following you
