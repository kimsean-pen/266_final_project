Let me wrap myself around you, let you show me how I see
And when you come back in from nowhere, do you ever think of me?
Your heart is not able
Let me show you how much I care

I need those eyes to tide me over, Ill take your picture when I go
Gives me strength and gives me patience but Ill never let you know
I got nothin' on you, baby, but I always said I'd try
Let me show you how much I care
But sometimes it gets hard and don't she know

Don't give the ghost up just clench your fists
You should have known by now you were on my list
Don't give the ghost up just clench your fists
You should have known by now you were on my list

Don't give the ghost up just clench your fists
You should have known by now you were on my list
When your heart is not able
And your prayers, they're not fables
