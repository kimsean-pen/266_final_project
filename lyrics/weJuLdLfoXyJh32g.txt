Keep your old and wasted words
My heart is breaking like you heard
But the town has always turned
These lies and made them all burn

Keep your old and wasted words
My heart is breaking like you heard
But the town has always turned
These lies and made them all burn

Can you feel the leeches bite
That boy that she took out tonight
He's brave and walking sure
Through all the spots you're working for

Keep your old and wasted words
My heart is breaking like you heard
But the town has always turned
These lies and made them all burn

When the light is out and words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
