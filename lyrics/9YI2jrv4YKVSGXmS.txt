You see the world within your plan
Change it all at your command
But all the dollars in the land
Will never fill you up again
You cut your face to fit right in
Sell your soul if that's the trend
But all of those malignant friends
Will turn their backs on you again

Tonight, you better pick a side
Do you see in darkness or light

You sacrificed your innocence
So you could be a part of them
But all thats left are skeletons
When vultures eat away the flesh
You drank the blood and bowed your head
Crossed the line with no regrets
But all of those malignant friends
Will turn their backs on you again

Tonight, you better pick a side
Do you feel a heartbeat this time
Yeah tonight, you better pick a side
Do you see in darkness or light
Pick a side

So tonight, you better pick a side
Do you feel a heartbeat this time
Yeah tonight, you better pick a side
Do you see in darkness or light
Pick a side
Pick a side
Pick a side
