Behind closed doors your words ring hollow
What you said they'd be
What behavior?
Who are you, but I like it
Now I'm done with nothing new
Sometimes green sometimes blue

And I'm guilty
And I'm guilty
And I'm guilty
And I'm guilty
And you're guilty too

He, hey, hey I'm guilty
And you're guilty too
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I'll tell you something, something new
You're hearing nothing, nothing true
You're killing me, I'm killing you
And I'm guilty too

One two three
I found you out so easily
One two three
I found in you what I found in me
The time is wrong, the time is right
Be careful who you kill tonight

And I'm melting
And I'm melting
And I'm melting
And I'm melting
And I'm melting in you

Hey, hey, hey I'm guilty
And you're guilty too
Hey, hey, hey, hey

One and one and one makes three
One and one why don't you see
I'm killing you, you're killing me
Can't you set me free

Inside out,
I can't describe it
What you do to me
Inside out
I cannot hide it
Looking right through me
Now I've reached the living end
Pointing fingers to defend

And I'm guilty
And I'm guilty
And I'm guilty
And I'm guilty
And you're guilty too

Hey, hey, hey I'm guilty
And you're guilty too
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I'll tell you something, something new
You're hearing nothing, nothing true
You're killing me, I'm killing you
And I'm guilty too
