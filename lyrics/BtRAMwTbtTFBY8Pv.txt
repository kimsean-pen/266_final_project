I'll take a shot in the dark
I saw you standing in the doorway
There are a lot of things we try to hide
But you are drowning, it's in your eyes

I don't want to be known for a lack of control
I don't want to be the last to know
I've come to find we are consumed by what we try to hide

But it's too cold to walk home
And I know I shouldn't call you
It's too cold to walk home
And you know that I will call you

React or divide, the room is silent, I am anxious
We're too young, we're too young, to let this get in the way
