The silence brings a panic
It fills the empty space
To feed this paranoia
Trapped in a mental cage
The rough and jagged edges
That line–± this feeble state
Prevent my hands from gripping
Oh, how they shake

This is a warzone
This is a warzone

A hurricane of anger
The howling winds of rage
An ocean of confusion
The storm inside of me
Slowly losing control
Desperate for a glimpse of hope

This is a warzone

The seconds feel like hours
The minutes pass like days
Begin to count down from ten
And don't forget to

Breathe in tranquility
Breathe in serenity
Breathe in a sense of relief
Before it escapes
Before it escapes
Before it escapes

This is a warzone
This is a warzone
This is a warzone
This is a warzone

I am fighting, I am fighting back
I am fighting, I am fighting back
I am fighting, I am fighting back
I am fighting, I am fighting back
I am fighting back
