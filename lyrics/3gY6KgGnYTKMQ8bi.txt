Now Mary, can't you find a way to bring me down?
I'm so sorry that I had to go and let you down.
Knowing you, I'll think things are gonna be fine,
But then again, you'll probably change your mind.

I'm sorry, Mary, but being your mate,
Means trying to find something that you aren't going to hate.

What a season to be beautiful without a reason.
Knowing you, I'll think things are gonna be fine,
But then again, you'll probably change your mind.
Mary, can't you find a way to bring me down?
