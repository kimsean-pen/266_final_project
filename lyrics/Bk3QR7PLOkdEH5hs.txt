Am I the prisoner?
War, war, war, war

I am a ghost, but only if you remember
So save your prayers and promises for something better
My hands are tied, stuck in this room forever
I scream, but only echoes care to answer

We waged our war but failed to find our hope
We made our world, but lost our way back home
Will we fight through the storm or stay forever more
The Prisoners of war

Am I the Prisoner?
War, war, war, war

I sold my soul and traded my wings for glory
But when I close my eyes I hear the angels sing to me
(Woah)
I hear the angels sing to me (Woah)

We waged our war but failed to find our hope
We made our world, but lost our way back home
Will we fight through the storm or stay forever more
The Prisoners of war

Am I the Prisoner?

We live to exist but are we alive?
We can't run away, how will we survive?
I'm losing my grip, I can't wait to die
This time I'll learn from all I've done

And find myself behind the sun
(This time I'll learn from all I've done)
(And find myself behind the sun)
We have to die to feel like we're alive

We waged our war but failed to find our hope
We made our world, but lost our way back home
Will we fight through the storm or stay forever more
The Prisoners of war

Am I the Prisoner?

I am a ghost, but only if you remember
I am a ghost, but only if you remember

Will you remember me?
