Why I got this gel in my hair for no reason?
Sitting in my bedroom with my headphones bleeding
Staring at my posters of these japanese women
Dreaming of a day when it's worth what I'm seeing
Should I get my trophies out the box?
Should I hang my ribbons even though I lost?
Cross country was that fastest on the team
Cross country when I was only seventeen
Now the only thing I got are these memories
And a lot of time on my hands

Camo print depression
I keep my feelings hidden
No pills, no thrills
I'm not used to winning
But that's life, that's life

Camo print depression
I keep my feelings hidden
No pills, no thrills
I'm not used to winning
But that's life, that's life

What's gonna be my repuation?
Camera phone too close to the bunk bed
One on top and one on the bottom
Is that a Flip Cam?
(Yeah man)
I got two
(Oh shoot)
One for the B-roll, and one for the doc-u
These numbers mean nothing to me
My mama saw me on TV
Said she didn't recognize me
Mama saw me on TV
I'm not saying I'm a ride or die
Mama saw me on TV
Who to say what's wrong or right?
Mama saw me on TV
Mama saw me on TV
Mama saw me on TV
Mama turn the TV off

Camo print depression
I keep my feelings hidden
No pills, no thrills
I'm not used to winning
But that's life, that's life

Camo print depression
I keep my feelings hidden
No pills, no thrills
I'm not used to winning
But that's life, that's life

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
That's life
That's life
