Let me in, to your country
I've only come to play
Let me in, don't ignore me
'Cause I won't go away
If you shut me down I'll just come back
I'll ride in on some other track
If you let me know that I'm not allowed
I'll sail in on some other cloud
Someone said if I'm not careful I will end up old
But no one ever wrote a glory doing what they're told

Let me in, to your country
I don't wanna go
Let me in, it's not funny
You don't wanna know

When you're an alien
And your face don't fit
The walls go up and shutters down
You never get used to it
I am an alien
Because you say I am
And when you come to my world
You'll be an alien

(Just an alien, just an alien, just an alien)

Let me come through your borders
I only want to dance
Let me in, stamp my papers
Give the kid a chance
If you try to trample all my dreams
I'll get in by some other means
If you shut me out and don't explain
I'll fly back on another plane
I just want to bring some pleasure
How can that be wrong
And then your letter comes to send me
Back where I belong

Let me in, to your country
I don't wanna go
Let me in, it's not funny
You don't wanna know

When you're an alien
And your face don't fit
The walls go up and shutters down
You never get used to it
I am an alien
Because you say I am
And when you come to my world
You'll be an alien

(Just an alien, just an alien, just an alien
Just an alien, just an alien, just an alien)
