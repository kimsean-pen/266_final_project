Heavy we're rolling into the ocean
Deep as a love, crawls with emotion
Dip in your finger taste from this water
And stir me up darling

Waves that are still are
Brought into motion
Time that we spent
And foolishly cautioned
Sip on this water,
Taste from this heartbeat
And stir me up darling

Even when we're lost
We find a way to our glory

Hey hey oh oh oh
Hey hey oh oh oh

Steady we're holding up as two
And all of our days are made new
Sing to the valley, run to the river
And stir me up darling
In every way follow my pattern
Gently steady, as we move
This love is cold, cold like the season
So stir me up darling

Even when we're lost
We find a way to our glory
Even at all cost
We find a way to our glory

Hey hey oh oh oh
Hey hey oh oh oh

Even when we're lost
We find a way to our glory
Even at all cost
We find a way to our glory
Way to our glory
