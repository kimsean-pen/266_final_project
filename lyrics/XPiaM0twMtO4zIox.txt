In this room, I'm sitting by your side
Cause it rains for hours and the phone is off its hook
Standing on the edge, casting lots to set me up
Before you knock me down
Off the summer's edge and drown me
We're betting on our own lives
Making up for all the time we lost

In this house of cards we're all holding hearts and spades
(One breath, one step, could knock it all down)
But you lead with your eyes and you give it away
(Decide, Design, to cut from the clouds)
When the people you love get lost in the shuffle
(When you leave, you leave nothing but broken hearts)
You let it go and then you fold

So we stay on the open road
We drive for hours and still no end in sight at all
Driving in your car
Miss the stop sign fall in love
Just to get knocked down
Off the summer's edge and drown me
We're betting on our own lives
Making up for all the time we lost

In this house of cards we're all holding hearts and spades
(One breath, one step, could knock it all down)
But you lead with your eyes and you give it away
(Decide, Design, to cut from the clouds)
When the people you love get lost in the shuffle
(When you leave, you leave nothing but broken hearts)

Pull your punches and burn with your cigarettes
Pulled like a punch, burnt like a cigarette...
Forever!
