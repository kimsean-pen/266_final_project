I was born on the east side of things
Where the dollar is mighty and green
Don't let me fool you, I might look a little sweet
But I could get away with murder in my sleep

Blue lights, red lights don't scare me
A short skirt, even got dirt on the sheriff
I know it's easy just to look, but don't touch
My only hustle is love

I got you singing no, no, no, no
I'm not the type you take home to mama
(Take home to mama)
I got you singing no, no, no, no
I'm not the type you take home to mama
(Take home to mama)
She's gonna tell you that I'm bad, bad news
That I'll have you crying out that sad, sad news

'Cause I'm a b-b-b-b-bad, b-b-bad girl (Bitch)
'Cause I'm a b-b-b-b-bad, b-b-bad girl (Bitch)

He was born on the wrong side of things
But his kiss taste like cherries and cream
Don't let him fool you, he might look a little sweet
But he got every motherfucker at his feet

Blue lights, red lights don't scare him
Danger, yeah you know he shot the sheriff
I know it's easy just to look, but don't touch
My only hustle is love

I got you singing no, no, no, no
I'm not the type you take home to mama
(Take home to mama)
I got you singing no, no, no, no
But still you gonna take me home to mama
(Take home to mama)
She's gonna tell you that I'm bad, bad news
That I'll have you crying out that sad, sad news

'Cause I'm a b-b-b-b-bad, b-b-bad girl (Bitch)
'Cause I'm a b-b-b-b-bad, b-b-bad girl (Bitch)

Won't take you long to see that I'm a B-A-D
I'm a bad bitch

I'm not the girl you take home to your mama
I'm not the girl
I'm not the girl you take home to your mama
I'm not the girl

I got you singing no, no, no, no
I'm not the type you take home to mama
(Take home to mama)
I got you singing no, no, no, no
But still you gonna take me home to mama
(Take home to mama)
She's gonna tell you that I'm bad, bad news
That I'll have you crying out that sad, sad news

'Cause I'm a b-b-b-b-bad, b-b-bad girl (Bitch)
'Cause I'm a b-b-b-b-bad, b-b-bad girl (Bitch)
