Patience is a virtue, or so they say
You're looking for a different you, acting the same old way
If I turn my back too soon, will you be okay?
Is it better to burn out than to fade away?

And it guts me like a knife
You're my destroyer
And I race to run and hide
Why?
Does it eat you up inside?
So goddamn lonely
It's never enough, never enough

Some people stay
And some people break
And some people change sometimes

Hurts to love someone, someone like you
It's getting hard to find the light in your eyes
Your face is a story and I know every line
Trying to reach out but you're dancing out of time

And it guts me like a knife
You're my destroyer
And I race to run and hide
Why?
Does it eat you up inside?
So goddamn lonely
It's never enough, never enough

Some people stay
And some people break
And some people change sometimes
Some people stay
And some people break
And some people change sometimes

It's never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough

Some people stay
And some people break
And some people change sometimes
