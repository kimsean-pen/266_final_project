There is hope for us
There is distance between you and I
We have just enough
And it comes as no surprise

I was in between
You were matches and kerosene
Is you conscience clear
Can you get it clean
Can you get it clean

Did you celebrate without me
Did you tell them all about me
Did you sell me out
If you ever had a doubt

Kiss me on the mouth
Can you sing for me
Can you sing it out
Kiss me on the mouth

Does it get you off
To get it off your chest
Such an awful year
Such an awful mess

You can't write, you can't sing
You can't do anything at all
Is there someone here
Can you make the call
Please make the call

And the ambulance is here
And if I haven't made it clear

Kiss me on the mouth
Did you sell me out
If you ever had a doubt
Kiss me on the mouth
Can you sing for me
Can you sing it out

Is there hope for us
There are constants that we can't define
Is it all used up
Are we out of time

Did you sell me out
Well if you ever had a doubt

Kiss me on the mouth
Now the ambulance is here
And if I still haven't made it clear
Kiss me on the mouth
Can you sing for me
Can you sing it out
