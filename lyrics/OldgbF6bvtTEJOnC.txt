The more I see, the less I believe.
The more I hear, the less I care.
This world we've created has left me cold.
This world is sedated, dying in its sleep.

I feel nothing (I feel nothing)
See it written in a thousand faces,
The simple truth we fear.
See it happen in a thousand places.
Instinct, brought us here.

The more i see, the less i believe.
The more i hear, the less i care.
We used to be the chosen ones,
Second to none.
Left with what we've become,
A pathetic excuse... For life.

I feel nothing (I feel nothing)
See it written in a thousand faces,
The simple truth we fear.
See it happen in a thousand places.
Instinct, brought us here.

I can feel nothing, nothing at all,
Except for the pain, that hits me again.
I can feel nothing, nothing at all,
Except for the pain, that hits me again.

I feel nothing (I feel nothing)
See it written in a thousand faces,
The simple truth we fear.
See it happen in a thousand places.
Instinct, brought us here.
