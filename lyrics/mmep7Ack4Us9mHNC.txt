Let Me Know

When I feel what I feel, sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times, when I find, you wanna keep yourself from me,
When I don't have the strength, I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, Let me Know

Laaaaa hahh Let me know

When you feel, what you feel, oh how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But If you feel, oh like I feel, confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of
what I say, what I say I'm all about, all about

But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, Let me Know

Listen

Tell Me what it is (Tell me what it is)
There's no need to make believe
(make believe, no need to make believe)
Look beyond your words (look beyond your words)
Try to find a place for me (Try to find, find a place for me)

'Cause at your best, you are loved
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, Let me Know

Let Me Know
Let Me Know

See, stay at your best baby
