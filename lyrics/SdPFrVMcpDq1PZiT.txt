Always safe to know
What is good for taking blood stains from your clothes
Like I said before
When I bite your tongue out of your mouth, you'll know
(You'll know)

Just what am I supposed to say
And tell you why I turned out this way
Don't make me
Don't make me
If you love it, then let it go
And how I died, you'll never know
Just don't blame me
Don't hate me

You'll never make it alone
(It's easier to go)
You've always been on your own
(It's easier to go)

Nothing safe feels real
Waiting here to die
Just hoping I reveal
(There's something)
Picking up my brains
You can tell your mom that men are all the same
(The same)

Just what am I supposed to say?
And tell you why I turned out this way
Don't make me
Don't make me
If you love it, then let it go
And how I died, you'll never know
Just don't blame me
Don't hate me

You'll never make it alone
(It's easier to go)
You've always been on your own
(It's easier to go)
You'll have to pay to watch me die
Then I'll love you more
You'll never make it alive
It's easier to go
It's easier to go

Nowhere to go
Not leaving
Not going
I'm not kissing you goodbye
On my own
I'm nothing
Just bleeding
I'm not kissing you goodbye

She'll never make it alone
(Nowhere to go, not leaving)
You've always been on your own
(Not going, I'm not kissing you goodbye)
She'll never make it alone
(On my own, I'm nothing)
You've always been on your own
(Just bleeding, I'm not kissing you goodbye)

She'll never make it alone
(Nowhere to go, not leaving)
You've always been on your own
(Not going, I'm not kissing you goodbye)
She'll never make it alone
(On my own, I'm nothing)
You've always been on your own
(Just bleeding, I'm not kissing you goodbye)
