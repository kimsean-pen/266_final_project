Blind with dollars, bought and sold
And you pay for everything in cold, hard cash
Better read through the fine print, you sift through the ash

In the hand, blood money
In the sand, blood money

She's worth the ransom, he says, "Do you accept my card
Or can I pay for it now in cold, hard cash?
I'm priceless, you're worthless but it's not a bad match"

And I know you understand, it's blood money
In the hand
There's such a big demand for blood money
In the sand

A hundred and fifty grand, blood money
In the hand
It's flowing under the land like blood money
In the sand

He's worth the ransom, she says, "Why can't you get hot
Because you pay for this now in cold, hard cash?
You make the front page, I'm gonna bring back the lash"

Then I know you'll understand, it's blood money
In the hand
There's such a big demand for blood money
In the sand

A hundred and fifty grand, blood money
In the hand
It's flowing under the land like blood money
In the sand
