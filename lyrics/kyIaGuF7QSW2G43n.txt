Soft domination, hold me
Rule me captive, drain me empty
And I need you to know me
So no one else owns me

My instincts are extinct
Spit is sour and I'm pissed dry
And I need you to know me
So no one else owns me

Tell me you'll lift me up
Tell me you'll take me out of this place
Tell me you'll lift me up
Tell me you'll take me out of this place

Zero rest for the weary
Capital mass, infinite growth
And I need you to know me
So no one else owns me

Tell me you'll lift me up
Tell me you'll take me out of this place
Tell me you'll lift me up
Tell me you'll take me out of this place

They clip my claws and braid my hair
Dance on my back, my body bare
Let's bind their hands and seal their eyes
So that the blind can lead the blind

I've had enough with them, no function
You can't wipe their every tear away
And all at once, no revolution
A ghost inside and no one's safe

Soft domination, hold me
Rule me captive, drain me empty
And I need you to know me
So no one else owns me

Tell me you'll lift me up
Tell me you'll take me out of this place
Tell me you'll lift me up
Tell me you'll take me out of this place
