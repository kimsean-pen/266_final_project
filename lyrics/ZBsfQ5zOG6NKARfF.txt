The Devil's at our door

The Bloodwoods shiver in the glare of summers haze
Dust of ancient lands breathes beneath our feet
Since the dawn of time, giver of life divine
Shadowed by dark ruination, looming down the line

The poisoned lies of narrow minds
Now spread into the soul of life

Bitter blight fractures life
This call for change won't be too late

The Devil's at our door, the Devil's at our door
Selling fool's gold and a miracle cure

Hearts of fire unite and man their barricades
Truth is overwhelming, and yet hollow men still talk in vain
Sowing sickness, shifting focus away
Setting in stone a future we cannot sustain

We can't quench our thirst on profits gained
And we can't turn back once it begins

Bitter blight fractures life
This call for change won't be too late
Won't be too late
Won't be too late

They poison the well and expect us to drink
When the river runs dry only then, then will they see

'Cause you can line your pockets, but you can't buy back your soul
These gates are locked, this future is not yours to own
You can line your pockets, but you can't buy back your soul
These gates are locked, this future is not yours to own
Yeah

Bitter blight, it fractures life
This call for change won't be too late
This bitter, this bitter blight, bitter blight
It fractures, yeah, it fractures life
This call, this call for change, this call for change
It won't be, it won't be, it won't be too late
