Jackie, you yourself said it best when you said,
There's been a break in the continuum.
The United States used to be lots of fun back when the man and the myth
Of the sands and the cliffs composed a symphony to good works and better business.

Jackie, you yourself said it best when you said,
One day, we'll look upon a washed-up Atlantic.
Get our kicks on an ocean of antics,
And making history has never been so easy.

So visualize success, but don't believe your eyes.
There's a world of wisdom and pain to despise.
And when people get paid just to set you straight, it means...

Are you gonna start the sunshine?
(Who is gonna stop the sunshine?)
And you're gonna start the sunshine.
(Who is gonna stop the sunshine?)

Are you gonna start the sunshine?
(Who is gonna stop the sunshine?)
And you're gonna start the sunshine.
(Who is gonna stop the sunshine?)

Are you gonna start the sunshine?
(Who is gonna stop the sunshine?)
And you're gonna start the sunshine.
(Who is gonna stop the sunshine?)

Visualize success! Visualize success!
Visualize success, but don't believe your eyes.
What's a version of the world without the will to despise it?
When people get paid just to set you straight, it means...

Jackie, hey, hey...
Jackie, hey, hey...
Jackie, hey, hey...
Jackie, hey, hey...
