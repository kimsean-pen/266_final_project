If you wanna soar with vultures, you'll have to swallow bone
The saint charade is over, plastic royalty exposed
You wanna play the victim to preach upon your throne
No semblance of virtue as your relevance erodes

We go queen for queen and move just like this

When you fall down will you back out
As you crawl through life with no crown
Though you preach love, you package lies
Just a pawn in a king's disguise

I never said I'm perfect, there's a guilt behind these eyes
So check me if it helps you fall asleep at night
Your skeletons are building, you closet's getting tight
Are you the prey or spider in the web of all your lies?

When you fall down will you back out
As you crawl through life with no crown
Though you preach love, you package lies
Just a pawn in a king's disguise

Don't stop breathing in the chemicals
You don't know humble though you play the role
Pockets of evergreen are your amphetamine
Please stop feeding what you can't control

You'll fall

You'll bend, you'll break, trip over your "fame"
Be careful, or you'll run your mouth off your face

When you fall down will you back out
As you crawl through life with no crown
Though you preach love, you package lies
Just a pawn in a king's disguise

Don't stop breathing in the chemicals
You don't know humble though you play the role
Pockets of evergreen are your amphetamine
Please stop feeding what you can't control
