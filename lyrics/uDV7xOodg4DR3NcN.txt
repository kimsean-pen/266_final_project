It's alright to tell me what you think about me
I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons
The season is calling
Your pictures are falling down
The steps that I retrace
The sad look on your face
The timing, and structure

Did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short
I'm writing the report on losing, and failing
When I move, I'm flailing now
And it's happened once again
I'll turn to a friend

Someone that understands
Sees through the masterplan
But everybody's gone, and I've been here for too long
To face this on my own
Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up
And maybe I'll see you at a movie, sneak preview
You'll show up, and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile, and you'll wave

We'll pretend it's ok
The charade, it won't last
When he's gone I won't come back
And it'll happen once again

You'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the masterplan
But everybody's gone
And you've been here for too long
To face this on your own
Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up
