You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Till you heard the voices in your ear

Hey, it's me again
Plain, you see again
Please, can I see you every day?
I'm a fool again
I fell in love with you again
Please, can I see you every day?

You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Till you heard the voices in your ear
You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Till you heard the voices in your ear

Words don't come out right
I tried to say it, oh, so right
I hope you understand my meaning
Hey, it's me again
I'm so in love with you again
Please, can I see you every day?

You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Till you heard the voices in your ear
You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Till you heard the voices in your ear

I remember every word you said
I remember voices in my head
I remember every word you said

(I hear your voice)
Your voices
Cool voices
Warm voices

It was just what I needed to
(Words don't seem right)
Cool voices
Warm voices

Your voices
But it's just what I needed for
(Love is the word)
Warm voices

Your voices
Cool voices
It was just what I needed to
(I hear your voice)
Your voices
Cool voices
Warm voices
It was just what I needed to
Just what I needed to, just what I needed
You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Till you heard the voices in your ear
You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Till you heard the voices in your ear
You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Till you heard the voices in your ear
