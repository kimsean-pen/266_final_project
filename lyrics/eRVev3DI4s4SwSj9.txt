Dark velvet skylines
I've gotten my hands tied
in debt digging deeper still
Now in my mind's eye
I'm trapped and I can't find
My way out of crippling doubt

Oooh

Sun is always shining through
Shapes of the night sky
Don't you even let them believe
You're not the light.
They'll try to frighten you
Into needing more than
You agreed to

Oooh

Now that I'm here
I can steer you
Far away
From the evil
From those who
Feed off you

Oooh
