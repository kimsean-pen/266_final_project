On that day they'll tell you
That life hummed on with no clue
The warning signs were all dismissed or shouted down
So it goes
The kings all failed to tell us
The madmen failed to sell us
On what would then become the only life we know?
Were they burning signal fires
To guide us to the fields?

Or building funeral pyres?
The outcome of a final appeal
The city lines are down
The Kerosene's run out

The fracturing of all we relied upon
Let's shed this unclean skin
And start to feel again

Because all the shoulders
On which to cry are gone
The paranoaia gripped us
The rain turned engines to rust

The panic set in like a cancer to our hearts
Spreading through
We bet on finite genius
Or prayed for gods to save us
But there was no antidote
Disease tore us apart
We left bodies in the fields
So numb that we forgot how to feel

The city lines are down
The Kerosene's run out

The fracturing of all we relied upon
Let's shed this unclean skin
And start to feel again

Because all the shoulders
On which to cry are gone
He looked at the fields
And then his hands

"All I need is what I have"
Then shed a tear of happiness
She watched the world
Crumble away

"Is this the end of yesterday?"
"Lord, I hope so", is all he said
Oh, Gone are the old guards
Gone are the cold, cold wars

Weightless we go forth
On wings of amnesty
(All we rely on now)
The city lines are down

The Kerosene's run out
The fracturing of all we replied upon
Let's shed this unclean skin
And start to feel again
With no more shoulders
Shoulders to cry on now
(ooohooooh)
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
The weight that we once had is gone
