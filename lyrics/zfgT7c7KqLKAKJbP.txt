Clumsy
But I love how you go down
Head first and style it out
Again and again

Clumsy
Keep on bumping into you
Bangin' all over this bedroom
Again and again

Call me a fool, call me insane
But don't call it a day
Closer to you, closer to pain
It's better than far away, oh
Oh-oh-oh (whoa-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh (oh)
Oh-oh-oh (whoa-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh
Oops!

Hey, clumsy
Hey, clumsy
Whooooa, whooooa

Clumsy
'Cuz I'd be slipping out this dress
Foolin' around and then we smash
Again and again (come here, baby)

Clumsy
Never told a soul about what we've done
You let it roll right off your tongue
Again and again

Call me a fool, call me insane
But don't call it a day
Closer to you, closer to pain
It's better than far away, oh
Oh-oh-oh (whoa-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh (oh)
Oh-oh-oh (whoa-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh
Oops!

Hey, clumsy
Hey, clumsy
Whooooa, whooooa

Clumsy
Bangin' all over this bedroom
Clumsy, clu-clumsy
Bangin' all over this bedroom
Clumsy, clu-clumsy
Bangin' all over this bedroom
Bangin' all over this bedroom
Again and again and again and again and again and again and...

Call me a fool, call me insane
But don't call it a day
Closer to you, closer to pain
It's better than far away, oh
Oh-oh-oh (whoa-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh (oh)
Oh-oh-oh (whoa-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh
Oops!

Hey, clumsy
Hey, clumsy
Whooooa, whooooa
