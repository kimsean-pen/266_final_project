Yeah, yeah

Livin' in a shack in a one-horse town
Trying to get to heaven 'fore the sun goin' down
Lizard in a bottle, yeah
Dizzy in a haze for 40 days
Hey there, lil' devil

Come on lil' devil, be my little angel
Come on lil' devil, be my angel, ow

Oh, she came on with an alligator smile
Dynamite lover, scorpion child
Trying to get to heaven 'fore the sun goes down, yeah
She came on with a cyclone kiss
Hey there baby, you don't never miss
Lizard in a bottle, oh yeah

Come on lil' devil, be my little angel
Come on lil' devil, be my
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Come on lil' devil, be my little angel
Come on lil' devil, be my little angel, angel
Come on lil' devil, be my little angel
Come on lil' devil, be my, oh be my, a-a-a-angel
