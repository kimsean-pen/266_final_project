Twist around the lounge
Sun drowns the house
Stick another pill in my head and go to bed
We're not doing it again so leave it

I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
Girl I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

Bombs have run out
Call round the town
"I could hear you giving her head" she said
You think we're doing it again, keep dreaming

I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
Girl I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
Girl I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
Girl I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine

I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine

I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
