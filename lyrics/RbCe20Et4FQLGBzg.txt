You fell out of my name
'Cause I must have lost my tolerance
Been covering my pain talking to a quiet audience
I knew that crash was coming then
I felt it in my blood
Great grandma was a voodoo girl
She told me bout the flood

She sang boy, you are a runaway
You won't have nothing in your hands until you give it all away
Boy, you are a runaway
And nothing's gonna change unless you change

I'm sorry I can't talk right now
Some things are out of my control
My fathers in the jailhouse, no
I think he's in the hospital
My mother is incredible
She's held us for so long
She's like the breath behind my words
Should have the rights to all my songs

She sang boy, you are a runaway
You won't have nothing in your hands until you give it all away
Boy, you are a runaway
And nothing's gonna change unless you change

I've always been a shy kid
There's a shadow on my name
I've learned you're supposed to deal with it
I've had a taste of fame
But somethings always holding back
My politeness isn't fought
But it's never done me any good
I should probably let it go

And say boy, you are a runaway
You won't have nothing in your hands until you give it all away
Boy, you are a runaway
And nothing's gonna change unless you
Nothing's gonna change unless you change

Out of nowhere
She's leaning in your window, singing
Songs, out of your soundtrack
Play it back
Permanently into your heart

Boy, boy, you are a runaway
Boy, boy, nothing in your hand
Boy, boy, you are a runaway
Boy, boy riding on the last wave
