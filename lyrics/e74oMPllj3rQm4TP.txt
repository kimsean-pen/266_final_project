To dust

If passion had a motive
It would be to tear me apart
I am truly it's captive
Surrendered to it's hold

I can't sleep anymore

Wide awake
Wide awake, I am a slave to myself
Wide awake, I set fire to myself

Sadness is etched in your face
I can see it under your eyes
I can see it in the cracks in your skin
You can see it even when you sleep

I would never trade my life
Trade my life for yours
Sold your soul to the lie you live

I will let this break me
I will let this break me
Let this burn me out

Reduced to ash
By what burns in me
I will live unburdened
Reduced to ash
By what burns in me
I will live unburdened by the
Overwhelming feeling
That I threw it all away
I will let this break me
I will let this burn me out
I will be ripped apart

Fate unlived, path unwalked
This could never be

Forgiven
