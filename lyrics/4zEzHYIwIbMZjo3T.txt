What if birds aren't singing they're screaming
I got high, I thought I saw an angel
But he was just a ghost
He was making wooden posts out of my family

What if birds aren't singing they're screaming
What if birds aren't singing they're screaming

What if my moon gets caught up in my waning
Trapped under a sky left blacker than the eyes of my visitors

What if birds aren't singing they're screaming
What if birds aren't singing they're screaming

I got high, I thought I saw an angel
But it was just a ghost heaving under his cloak[?]

What if birds aren't singing they're screaming
What if birds aren't singing they're screaming
