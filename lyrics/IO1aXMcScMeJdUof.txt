Here's where I stand so don't say a word
Sunset is not the same 'cause my eyes are closed
Is not that I'm all loose, I just wanna feel
Feel the dawn in peace so my brain can heal

Here's where I stand so don't say a word
The pain is consuming me 'cause my heart is hurt
Go find some new air now, I'm begging to breathe
Breathe for something more so my lungs can speak

Grab my hands until
'Till it's calm again
Grab my hands until
You

Here's where I stand so don't say a word
Sunset is not the same 'cause my eyes are closed
Is not that I'm all loose, I just wanna feel
Feel the dawn in peace so my brain can heal

Here's where I stand so don't say a word
The pain is consuming me 'cause my heart is hurt
Go find some new air now, I'm begging to breathe
Breathe for something more so my lungs can speak

Grab my hands until
'Till it's calm again
Grab my hands until
You
