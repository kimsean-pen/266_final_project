Hangin out on Second Avenue
Eating chicken vindaloo
I just want to be with you
I just want to have something to do

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Well allright
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Wait-now
Wait-now

Hanging out all by myself
I don't want to be with anybody else
I just want to be with you
I just want to have something to do

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Well allright
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Wait-now
Wait-now

Hanging out all by myself
I don't want to be with anybody else
I just want to be with you
I just want to have something to do

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Well allright
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
