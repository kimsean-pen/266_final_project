The edge it calls to me from the grey
I don't know what I will say and I'm afraid of
Being oblivious to oblivion
I'll say a prayer under my breath
And hope you'll hear

If it's my time to go
I don't want to look back

I'm waiting for something
Like a light to guide my way
Just step into nothing
When I'm not quite sure that
I don't want to stay
I want to believe that
That somehow I'll be fine
And everything's alright and
This is not my time

The art of balancing is lost on me
I don't know which way to fall into Infinity
Will it feel like waking up
Or falling back to dream
And sleep forever on

If it's my time to go
I don't want to look back

I'm waiting for something
Like a light to guide my way
Just step into nothing
When I'm not quite sure that
I don't want to stay
I want to believe that
That somehow I'll be fine
And everything's alright and
This is not my time

Will it feel like waking up like before
The way your dream just disappears
Will it feel like giving up
And letting go and drifting out

I'm waiting for something
Like a light to guide my way
Just step into nothing
When I'm not quite sure that
I don't want to stay
I want to believe that
That somehow I'll be fine
And everything's alright and
This is not my time

This is not my time
This is not mine!
