Try my friend loving all the things we used to do
I realize there was not very much to love
But that's no reason to go on living in the past

Try my friend doing all the things we used to do
If you could color me, it would be darkest blue
Give me another chance
I'll love you more than in the past

It's up to you to do the things I want you to
Don't question me
It's gotta be this way

Please my friend hear me out before you have to go
It's time you understand
I think you ought to know
Give me another chance
I'll love you more than in the past
