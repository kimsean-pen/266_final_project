There's a stain on my notebook where your coffee cup was
And there's ash in the pages now I've got myself lost
I was writing to tell you that my feelings tonight
Are a stain on my notebook that rings your goodbye

Oh, now she's gone and I'm back on the beat
A stain on my notebook says nothing to me
Oh, now she's gone and I'm out with a friend
With lips full of passion and coffee in bed

With the way that you left me I can hardly contain
The hurt and the anger and the joy of the pain
Now knowing I am single they'll be fire in my eyes
A stain on my notebook for a new love tonight

Oh, now she's gone and I'm back on the beat
A stain on my notebook says nothing to me
Oh, now she's gone and I'm out with a friend
With lips full of passion and coffee in bed

Oh, now she's gone and I'm out with a friend
With lips full of passion and coffee in bed

From the lips without passion to the lips with a kiss
There's nothing of your love that I'll ever miss
The stain on my notebook remains all that's left
Of the memory of late nights and coffee in bed
Of the memory of late nights and coffee in bed

Now she's gone and I'm back on the beat
Oh, a stain on my notebook says nothing to me
Oh, now she's gone and I'm out with a friend
With lips full of passion and coffee in bed

Now she's gone, I'm back on the beat
A stain on my notebook says nothing to me
Now she's gone, I'm back on the beat
A stain on my notebook says nothing to me
Oh coffee in bed, coffee in bed

Black coffee in bed
Black coffee in bed
Black coffee in bed
