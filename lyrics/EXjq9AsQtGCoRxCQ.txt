In the morning light
Let my roots take flight
Watch me fall above
Like a vicious dove
They don't see me come
Who can blame then
They never seem to catch my eye
But I've never wondered why

I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep

Hey yeah
Don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah
Tiptoe higher
Take some time to
Simmer down keep your head down low
Hey yeah
Tiptoe higher

From your slanted view
See the morning dew
Sink into the soil
Watch the water boil
They won't see me run
Who can blame them
They never look to see me fly
So I never had to lie

I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep

Hey yeah
Don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah
Tiptoe higher
Take some time to
Simmer down keep your head down low
Hey yeah
Tiptoe higher

Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else

Hey yeah
Don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah
Tiptoe higher
Take some time to
Simmer down keep your head down low
Hey yeah
Tiptoe higher

Hey yeah
Don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah
Tiptoe higher
Take some time to
Simmer down keep your head down low
Hey yeah
Tiptoe higher
