When I feel all alone
Losing faith, can't go on
When I start breaking down
With my strength running out

When I'm searching, falling, drowning
When I am blinded by the dark

I feel you all around
I feel you all around
You know me inside and out
You lift me up!
I feel you all around
I feel you all around
You love me inside and out
You lift me up!

(Oh oh oh oh...)
You lift me up!

Tell myself all the time
Don't be scared, you'll be fine
When your world falls apart
Hold on to your dreams, don't give up!

When I'm Searching, fighting, hoping
When I am blinded by the dark

I feel you all around
I feel you all around
You know me inside and out
You lift me up!
I feel you all around
I feel you all around
You love me inside and out
You lift me up!

(Oh oh oh oh...)
You Lift Me Up!
(Oh oh oh oh...)
You Lift Me Up!

Searching, fighting, hoping
When I am blinded by the dark

I feel you all around
I feel you all around
You know me inside and out
You lift me up!
I feel you all around
I feel you all around
You love me inside and out
You lift me up!

(Oh oh oh oh...)
You lift me up!
(Oh oh oh oh...)
You lift me up!
