I sing a song to the dead.
From my heart profoundly sad.
Forlorn, I cling to everything that is them by betraying their peace.
I keep death in asylum.
Song for the dead!

I touch their eyes, harvest their ruin, and wrap it in mine to try to see them.
I can't let them go, this day in decay, til death do us part - that's what they all say.
Song for the dead!

I wear their clothes, so warm and tight.
You think it's wrong? I know I'm right.
Cause even their hair, so soft and fine, once straightened their skull, now looks good on mine.
Oh... looks good on mine.
Song for the dead!

All good things must come to an end.
Empty words when death is your friend.
I will leave this endless lucid dream, to the land of the dead and to liberty.
Never buried, need to forecome, I can't - I'm lost amongst them all.
And when my kingdom will meet it's maker, what song will I sing at the undertaker?
