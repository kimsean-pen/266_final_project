Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved and be loved?

Don't let them fool ya
Or even try to school ya
Oh no!
We've got a mind of our own
So go to hell if what you're thinking is not right
Love would never leave us alone
A-yin the darkness there must come out to light

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, woh now, and be loved?

(The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too
So while you point your fingers someone else is judging you)
Love your brotherman (could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved?)
(Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
(Could you be, could you be loved?)

Don't let them change ya, oh
Or even rearrange ya
Oh no!
We've got a life to live
They say
Only, only
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive
Stay alive, eh

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, woh now, and be loved?

(You ain't gonna miss your water until your well runs dry
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied)

Say something, say something (could you be loved?) say something
Say something, reggae, reggae
Say something, rockers, rockers
Say something, reggae, reggae
Say something, rockers, rockers
