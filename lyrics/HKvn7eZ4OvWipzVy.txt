Absorbing the reflection of another's mirror image
Cracked glass gnashed by depraved attempt
Commended by mindless plebes surrounding
This paper mache perception
Holds no weight to the pantheons before you

Burn, burn, burn
To burn your world

A fire has been lit
A ritual has begun
A fire has been lit
Let the flames of your life engulf you

I stand watch with the fires of a thousand raids
Laying quiet behind my tongue
No amount of smiles will expiate your doings
But the stars will see substance
And out a muzzle as I laugh
The purveyor of true paths
