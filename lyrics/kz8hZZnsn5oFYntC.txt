Lord, grace me
With continuous power

I do not fight
The war again
The common breed
Is nothing more
Than soft insecurity
Think with your heart
And feel for yourself
Think about attention
When we invented the air

Close your eyes
Do you see what I see?

Close your eyes
The war in you is the war in me

I do not fight
The war again
A common breed
It's nothing more
Than insecurity
Think with your heart
And feel for yourself
Think about attention
When we invented the air

Close your eyes
Do you see what I see?

Close your eyes
The war in you is the war in me

Close your eyes
Do you see what I see?

Close your eyes

The war in you is the war in me

Lord, grace me
With continuous power
