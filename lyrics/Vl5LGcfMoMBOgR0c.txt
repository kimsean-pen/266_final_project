Mmm yeah
Mmm hmm

Well since we been done
I've been trying to un-fall apart
And I've been thinking that some neon lights
Would be a real good start
Well I called a couple friends
But they all say they're staying in
So I guess I'm going out on my own
I might be heart broke
But that don't mean that I'm gonna stay home, yeah

I can buy my own drinks
I can pay my own tab
At the end of the night when they cut on all the lights
I can call my own cab
I can drop my own change in the jukebox
I can dance all by myself
'Til I can stop thinkin' 'bout drinkin' 'bout him
I don't need nobody else
Yeah I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
Yeah I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)

Found myself a dive
The type he would never walk in
Then a guy at the bar sees an empty drink in my hand
I said sweet of you to ask
If you could fill my glass
But I'm gonna have to pass this time
Me and myself, yeah well we're doing just fine

I can buy my own drinks
I can pay my own tab
And at the end of the night when they cut on all the lights
I can call my own cab
I can drop my own change in the jukebox
I can dance all by myself
'Til I can stop thinkin' 'bout drinkin' 'bout him
I don't need nobody else
Yeah I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
Yeah I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)

I can walk my own self to the front door
I can take my own self to bed
I can medicate my own headache
Hell, I can be my own boyfriend

I can buy my own drinks
I can pay my own tab
And at the end of the night when they cut on all the lights
I can call my own cab
I can drop my own change in the jukebox
I can dance all by myself
'Til I can stop thinkin' 'bout drinkin' 'bout him
I don't need nobody else
Yeah I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
Yeah I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)

I can drop my own change in the jukebox
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
I can dance all by myself
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
