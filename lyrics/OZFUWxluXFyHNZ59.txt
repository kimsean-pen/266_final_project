I said farewell to the sunlight, said farewell to the sea
And farewell to my loved ones, there's no hope left for me
Farewell to my sorrow and farewell memories
Misery for company, there's no hope left for me

I was searching for an exit though I find my place
But there was nothing there but empty faith
How can you find your way
Through ignorance, intolerance, and hate?

Farewell, God, you won't find me
I've lost my faith, but I am free
So search your heart, and you will see there's no hope in misery

I said farewell to the sunlight, said farewell to the sea
And farewell to my loved ones, there's no hope left for me
Farewell to my sorrow and farewell memories
Misery for company, there's no hope left for me

No hope, no hope, no hope left for me
No gods, no gods, no gods left for me
No hope, no hope, no hope left for me

Farewell, God, you won't find me
I've lost my faith, but I am free
So search your heart, and you will see there's no hope in misery

I said farewell to the sunlight, said farewell to the sea
And farewell to my loved ones, there's no hope left for me
Farewell to my sorrow and farewell memories
Misery for company, there's no hope left for me

Farewell, God, you won't find me
Farewell, God, you won't find me
Farewell, God, you won't find me
Farewell, God, you won't find me
