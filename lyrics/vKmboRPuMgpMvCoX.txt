I've been lost, locked up and shot
I'm never gonna let them win, never going down again
My soul, colder than stone
And the dog, chewing a bone

I, I've been waiting
I, I've been waiting
Swing Low

And I'm down, tied to the sound
Of the drum, pushing me up
Come on and show me where to go
Carry me home, swing Low

I, I've been waiting
I, I've been waiting
Swing Low

So let's go
You mean, we've got to go
I'll follow you wherever you go
I'll follow you wherever you want to go
Wherever you want to go

I've been lost, locked up and shot
I'm never gonna let them win, never going down again
Come and show me where to go
Carry me home, swing Low

Pa, pa pa pa, pa
Pa, pa pa pa, pa

Pa, pa pa pa, pa
Pa, pa pa pa, pa

Pa, pa pa pa, pa
Pa, pa pa pa, pa
