I believe in harmony
I believe in Christmas Eve
Free for all the happiness
and no ones living on their wits
One so kind and one so wise
One so kind throughout your life
Fill yourself with dreams
Fill yourself with dreams
Fill yourself with dreams
I believe in destiny
I believe your trust was free
Free for all the happiness
and no ones living with regret
One so kind and one so wise
One so kind throughout you life
Fill yourself with dreams
Fill yourself with dreams
Fill yourself with dreams
Oh and now we know, no one ever told now you can be bold
I believe in solitude
I believe in till there was you
Free for all the happiness
and no ones living on their wits
One so kind and one so wise
One so kind throughout you life
Fill yourself with dreams
Fill yourself with dreams
Fill yourself with dreams
Harmony and no dilemmas
Harmony and no dilemmas
Harmony and no dilemmas

one so kind throughout your life

Fill yourself with dreams
Fill yourself with dreams
come fill yourself with dreams

Oh now you know
no one ever told
now you can be bold

And I believed in solitude
I believed too little was few
Free for all your happiness
and no ones living on their wits

One so kind and one so wise
One so kind throughout your life

Fill yourself with dreams
Fill yourself with dreams
Come fill yourself with dreams
