I got a gal who's always late
Any time we have a date
But I love her
Yes, I love her

I'm gonna walk right up to her gate
And see if I can get it straight
'Cause I want her
I'm gonna ask her

Is you is or is you ain't my baby
Youse is still my baby, baby
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out

A woman is a creature that has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one
You'll find she's gone and made a change

Is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true

Is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true
