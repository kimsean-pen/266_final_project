You torched a Saab like a pile of leaves
I'd gone to find some better wheels
Four or five meters running 'round the bend
When the government agents surround you again
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby baby baby baby right on time

Out of control but you're playing a role
You think you can go to the eighteenth hole
Well, you flip-flop the day of the championship
Try to go it alone, you roll for a bit
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby baby baby baby right on time

Baby baby baby baby right on
Baby baby baby it's a light on
Baby baby baby it's a lifetime
Baby baby baby baby right on
Time, time, time, time, time
Baby baby baby baby right on time

Let 'em go
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby baby baby baby right on time

Irish and proud baby naturally
But you got the luck of a Kennedy
So grab the wheel, keep holding it tight
'Til you're driving off in the black of the night
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby baby baby baby right on time

Baby baby baby baby right on
Baby baby baby baby right on
Baby baby baby it's a light on
Baby baby baby it's a lifetime
Baby baby baby baby right on
Time, time, time, time, time
Baby baby baby baby right on time

Nobody knows what the future holds on
Said it's bad enough just getting old
Live my life, they say it's too fast
You know I love the past, 'cause I hate suspense
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby baby baby baby right on time
