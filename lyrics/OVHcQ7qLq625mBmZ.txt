Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
You better, please, hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

I don't want to bother you, but I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing all my happiness
For I love a man who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix, so

Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
You better, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, if your arrow makes his love strong for me
I swear I'm gonna love him 'til eternity
I know that 'tween the both of us, his heart we can steal
Cupid, help me if you will, so

You better, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
You better, please, hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Yeah hey hey, Cupid
Oh oh, Cupid
I love him, love him
