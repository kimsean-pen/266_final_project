Spending time in measured ways to measure life
See time erode so easily
Find seconds of activity and go back to overwhelmed
Let's build a new community

If fire taught a lesson to the gods
If pain approaches empathy
If saints aren't given voice to teach of burns
We're led to blood periphery

It's not enough to hate the world we live within
It's not enough to hate the world we live within
It's not enough to hate the world we live within
It's not enough to hate the world we live within
