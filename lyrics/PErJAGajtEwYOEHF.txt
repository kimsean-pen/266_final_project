When you looked into my eyes
I stood there like I was hypnotised
You sent a feeling to my spine
A feeling warm and smooth and fine
But all I could do were stand there paralyzed

When we kissed, ooh what a thrill
You took my hand and, ooh baby, what a chill
I felt like grabbin' you real tight
Squeeze and squeeze with all my might
All I could do was stand there paralyzed

Oh yeah lucky me, I'm singing ev'ry day, ooh ooh
Ever since that day you came my way, ooh
You made my life for me just one big happy game
I'm gay ev'ry morning, at night I'm still the same
Well do-ooh you remember that wonderful time
When you held my hand and swore that you'd be mine
In front of preacher you said "I do"
I couldn't say a word for thinking of you
All I could do was stand there paralyzed

Oh, lucky me, I'm singing every day, ooh ooh
Ever since the day you came my way, ooh
You made my life for me just one big happy game
I'm gay every morning, at night I'm still the same
Holy child, do you remember that wonderful time
When you held my hand and swore that you'd be mine
In front of the preacher you said " I do"
I couldn't say a word for thinking of you
All I could do was stand there paralyzed
All I could do was stand there paralyzed
