Was an honest man

Asked me for the phone
Tried to take control
Oh I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way

We shared some ideas

All obsessed with fame
Says we're all the same
I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way

Raised in Carolina
I'm not like that

Tryin' to remind her
When we go back

I missed the last bus
I'll take the next train
I try, but you see
It's hard to explain
I said the right things
But act the wrong way
I like it right here
But I cannot stay
I watched the TV
Forget what I'm told
Well I am too young
And they are too old
The joke is on you
This place is a zoo
You're right, it's true

He said he can't decide
I shake my head to say
Everythings just great

Oh I just can't remember
I just can't remember
Raised in Carolina (she says)
I'm not like that
Trying to remind her

When we go back
I say the right things
But act the wrong way
I like it right here
But I cannot stay
I watched the TV
Forget what I'm told
I am too young
And they are too old
I'll make it you see
I'm ever so pleased
Pretend to be nice
So I can be mean
I missed the last bus
I'll take the next train
I try, but you see
It's hard to explain
