Wild eyed and tight fisted, I'm fused to the bone
I stand contemplating reacting alone
Impaled with betrayal, the tourniquet turns
Society's creation pole axed out and burnt

Long ago when man was King
His heart was clean now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing
So now he's just a stained class King

Transfixed at deliverance, is this all there is
Faithless continuum into the abyss
Fierce is my conviction absolute my belief
I spit at you apathy and seducer deceits

Long ago when man was King
His heart was clean, now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing
So now he's just a stained class King

Lethal, deadly, hung, drawn and quartered
He slaughtered and faltered and altered the world
But by doing so smashed all his hopes and Utopian dreams
Whipping, stripping, peeling the flesh off relentless and senseless
His lust snapped like vipers whose fangs sank in deep
To infest and decay from the core

Impaled with betrayal, the tourniquet turns
Society's creation pole axed out and burnt

Long ago when man was King
His heart was clean, now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing
So now he's just a stained class King

Stained class King
