Sunshine, been keeping me up for days
There is no night time, it's only a passing phase
And I feel pretty, pretty enough for you
I felt so ugly before, I didn't know what to do

Sometimes is all I feel up to now
But it's not worth it to you
'Cos you gotta get out somehow

Is it the destruction that you require to feel?
Like somebody wants you
Someone that's more for real

Sunshine, been keeping me up for days
There is no night time, only a passing phase
And I'll feel pretty, another hour or two
I felt so ugly before
(Ugly before)
I didn't know what to do
(Do)
I felt so ugly before
(Ugly before)
I didn't know what to do
(Do)
I felt so ugly before
(Ugly before)
I didn't know what to do
(Do)
Ugly before
(Ugly before)
(Do)
