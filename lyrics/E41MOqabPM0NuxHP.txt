Bleed in your own light, dream of your own life
I miss me, I miss everything I'll never be, and on, and on
I torch my soul to show the world that I am pure
Deep inside my heart, no more lies

A crown of horns, an image formed deformed
The mark I've borne, a mark of scorn to you
Consume my love, devour my hate, only powers my escape
The moon is out, the stars invite, I think I'll leave tonight

Soon I'll find myself alone to relax and fade away
Do you know what's coming down, do you know I couldn't stay free?

I shall be free, I shall be free, I shall be free
I shall be free, free, free of those voices inside me

I shall be free
I shall be free
