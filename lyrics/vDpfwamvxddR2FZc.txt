Grind in the winter just to shine in the summer
Heard you say you 'bout that action
But I know that you a runner
Count cash under bulletproof glass in the hummer
White dope in my coat make your throat go numma

Grind in the winter just to shine in the summer
Heard you say you 'bout that action
But I know that you a runner
Count cash under bulletproof glass in the hummer
White dope in my coat make your throat go numma

Is this real life?
Gettin' money you do anything you feel like
Ain't no tellin' where I'm going count a blessin' when I see it her Undressin' in the morning
What it feel like?

Keep it goin', yeah I see now what I'm doin' is workin'
Used to get caught lyin', now she cryin' for certan
Even back when my pockets was hurtin'
You were stayin' by my side let me know was it worth it?

Keep in mind, never said I was perfect
Even when I'm dead in your head I'll be lurkin'
See me lookin' through the blinds when you open the curtians
When I'm gone you can keep me alive
