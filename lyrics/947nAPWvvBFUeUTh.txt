I saw the colors fade away
I saw the colors fade away
I saw the colors fade away
I saw the colors fade away
See you kicking the can down the road
And you staring at the dust
I hear you in the moonlight
Every word, seems like you say
I saw the colors fade away from you
You said, I saw the colors fade away
I saw the colors fade away from you now
I saw the colors fade away
So the scene all looks the same
As it did in the morning
And it feels like a storm
But it's all in your head
And I know that you feel like
You're not getting what you need right now
But give it a night
Wait for the light, yeah
Well, well, what can you say?
When your love just starts to fade away
Who, who, who can you tell?
You know this song just won't go away
Thinking back to the time before
Looking up from me on the floor
Did you not feel that something too?
Taking it back, bringing it up, on everything
I saw the colors fade away
I saw the colors fade away from you
I saw the colors fade away from you
I saw the colors fade away
Well, well, what can you say?
When your love just starts to fade away
Who, who, who can you tell?
You know this song just won't go away
I saw the colors fade away from you
I saw the colors fade away
I saw the colors fade away from you now honey
I saw the colors fade away
I saw the colors fade away from you
I saw the colors fade away
I saw the colors fade away from you
I saw the colors fade away
