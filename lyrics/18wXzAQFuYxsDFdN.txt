It's so easy here with you
Like a walk in the park just before dark
Always so easy here with you
Like sun on my face, a bright summer day

You're like a melody
That follows me
And when you go I still hear music constantly
You're like a melody
That follows me
And when you're gone you're haunting, yeah you're taunting me

As summer slips to fall, yes, it does
Seems no time's past at all, not at all
As summer slips to fall and then it snows
Then I watch you go, watch you go

You're like a melody
That follows me
And when you go I still hear music constantly
You're like a melody
That follows me
And when you go you're haunting, yeah (yeah) taunting me

I got a feeling 'bout you
It might be nothing new
But time slips by, I hardly try
So don't they say (?)
I won't be blue
'Cause love will follow, love will follow, follow you

You're like a melody
That follows me
And when you go I'll still hear music constantly
You're like a melody
That follows me
And when you go you're haunting, yeah you're taunting me

You're like a sweet smelling breeze
Sneaking up on me
And when you go you're haunting, yeah you're taunting me
You're like a melody
That follows me
And when you go I still hear music constantly

You're like a melody
That follows me
And when you go you're haunting, yeah you're taunting me
