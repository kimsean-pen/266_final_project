Hello
Hollow halo
Hello
(Can you hear them say?)
Hollow halo
(Can you hear them calling?)

You'll never
You'll never leave this world alone
You'll never
You'll never leave this world alone, if I
Become a martyr to the stars
Become a model to the same
Side that I've been fighting, I'm
Still afraid to crawl
(No more pointing fingers at mistakes and I'm)
And though I know I'm not the same
(Here in a reflection)
I'm still afraid to watch

How do you suppose?
We can lock the way to get us home
What you thought was lost, now found within
Feel this way there

No more pointing fingers at mistakes, and I'm
Here in a reflection

What a way to see this thing out
What a way to lay this burden down
What a way to see this sorrow
What a way to see this one out

Hello, hollow halo
Hello, hollow halo
Hello, hollow halo
Hello, hollow halo

All this leads to nothing
Still this world won't wait
Complicated nothings
Still this world won't wait

What a way to see this thing out
What a way to lay your burden down
What a way to signal tragedy
Hello, hollow halo

Hello, hollow halo
Hello, hollow halo
(Can you hear them say?)
Hello, hollow halo
(Can you hear them calling?)

(Can you hear them calling?)

"You can see all of this
And watch it before your eyes
And everything owes its existence
Solely and completely to sound
Sound is a factor of which holds it together
Sound is the basis of form and shape
Put that into the modern idiom
And say into the great voids of space
Came a sound, and matter took shape
Please watch carefully"

Sine waves and mirrors
Smoke that you inhale
Try mouthing bitter tones
Better left unsaid

I know this will burn you
So I become a fire, these days will change us all

Don't you feel the same?
Don't we fear the same things?
Don't we feel the same?

Don't you fear at all?

Lay here
Maybe the damage has been done
As we float away like embers
Beneath us, the fire, still, it burns
And I don't, I don't know why
Question who we are and then we die
I guess, I'll see you when it ends
I'll see you 'round the bend
My sober sorry friend

Don't you feel the same?
Don't we feel the same?
(I'll see you when it ends)
(I'll see you 'round the bend)
Don't you feel the same?
(My sober sorry friend)

When we collide
Some say goodbye
Some save their words
Leaving no resolve

There's a break in the wall
You can feel it
It's letting us all escape
So, people, tell me you need

A waking day
To fall asleep
Light your way
Find your place

In here
