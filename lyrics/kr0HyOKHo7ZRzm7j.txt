Feels like I've been here before
Leaning on the door
What are those cold eyes for?
I don't think I know
He's in all black and he thinks he's all that That's for sure
And the word in his ear
My initials are put what's this for?
I think I figured it out

You and I we will not work
Cause when my back is turned
You find a way to make things worse
I call for comfort but the strong comes first
I can't hold back
Can't hold back on you tonight
I won't hold back
Won't hold back on you tonight
Won't hold back no

You got that past going on
Regression coming up strong
I see no reason to lead you
I thought I'd follow you
Oh when you figure out
Cause time has come and gone
Lost your pull
Lost your touch
Forget a call or a cover up

I can't hold back
Can't hold back on you tonight
I won't hold back
Won't hold back on you tonight

Nobody wants to be alone

I can't hold back
Can't hold back on you tonight
I won't hold back
Won't hold back on you tonight

You and I we will not work
Cause when my back is turned
You find a way
You find a way to make things worse
