Stop It!

Red alert everybody! It's a catastrophe
But don't worry!
Don't panic!
Ain't nothing going on but history, yeah
It's alright
Don't panic!

And the music keeps on playing on and on
And the music keeps on playing on and on

Red alert everybody! It's a catastrophe
But don't worry!
Don't panic!
Ain't nothing going on but history, yeah
But it's alright
Don't panic!

And the music keeps on playing on and on
And the music keeps on playing on and on

On and on (yo, yo, yo, yoyo, yoyo)
On and on (yo, yo, yo, yoyo, yoyo)

On and on (yo, yo, yo, yoyo, yoyo)
On and on (yo, yo, yo, yoyo, yoyo)
And the music keeps on playing on and on (yo, yo, yo, yoyo, yoyo)

Everybody, shake shake shake shake
Everybody, shake shake shake shake
Oh, baby!
