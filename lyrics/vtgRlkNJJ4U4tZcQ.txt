Oh, will you walk or slowly run
Sweet old man, it is time
Disappear, but still there is laughter
Out in the shadows, me and you
Greying hair, [?]
Guess there is always been someone after

Guess we're always in beginnings of a wildness to return
Or rise into it and we feel a little lighter
Guess we're always in the question of the things we never learn
But we're only gone like singers' [?] till springtime
Let them out if they shall let them out

Some said the night is here so sleep
But if they knew the way
How a weather builds in the silence
It's where you try, it's gonna land
It's where you land, they will try
Guess they'd all look just like we're dancing

Guess we're only in beginnings of our silence to return
I rise above it and I feel a little lighter
Guess we're always in destruction of the little things we'd learn
But we're only gone like singers' [?] till springtime
Let them out if they should let them out ... now

And in the morning we're all out and see what's down there, oh
He cannot empty out this leg before I die
We let them back when it just felt like we were stealing, oh
But they're only gone like singers' [?] till springtime
Let them out, oh they should let them out ... now

I'm going to miss you now, allright
Guess I walk it somehow
Travel on to feel what is out there
It is on the borders you will think
Just of all these goodbyes
Send the memories of being looked after

Guess we're only in beginnings of a wildness to return
I rise into it and I feel a little lighter
Guess we're always in the phases of the things we'd never learn
But we're only gone like singers' [?] till springtime
Let them out if they should let them out
