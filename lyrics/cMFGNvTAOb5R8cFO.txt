If I told you
About my favourite dream
The one without you, would you spit fire at me
Or would you burn to know
Every scene blow by blow
I don't know her
Maybe she isn't real
She didn't hold back
When you were lying next to me
This can't be all we are
Silent and in the dark
We could be making sparks
But we don't ignite, don't ignite
We could be making sparks
But we need to fight, need to fight
Come a little closer
Remember when we used to sweat
Trembling in the covers taking it with no regret
This cant be all we are
Silent and in the dark
We could be making sparks
But we don't ignite, don't ignite
We could could be making sparks
But we need to fight, need to fight
No I never saw the walls falling on us like this
Now I'm hanging from a rope
Holding my hope, my hope
I don't need it
I just want it more than anything else
I can't do this alone, no no
We could be making sparks
But we don't ignite, don't ignite
We could be making making sparks
But we don't ignite, don't ignite
We could be making sparks
But we need to fight, need to fight
