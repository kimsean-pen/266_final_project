Everybody's back in town
Give me the armor and let me prepare
It can be easy or difficult to steer your heart and breath
Death cheats death it's clear

Time and tide wait for no man
Slowly realize as fast as you can
Thought I saw a glimpse of how you were at five
Ain't it strange how these things take you by surprise

We are drifting on a deep sea
And I can never get the stars like my father
Oh we're drifting out to sea into deep water
If we're scared, it puts us under

The more you talk, the less you mean
You told me that when I was just 17
When it sinks in you will not always be here
Funny how all your small worries disappear

We are drifting on the deep sea

And I could never get the stars like my father
Oh we're drifting out to sea into deep water
Oh we're drifting out to sea into deep water
Oh we're drifting out to sea into deep water
Oh we're drifting out to sea into deep water
Oh we're drifting out to sea into deep water
Oh we're drifting out to sea into deep water
If we're scared it puts us under

If you're thinking what you know is true then tell them
Let them know this
If your turn goes, ask the question
Would you tell them, know you're whole dear
Ooo ---oooo

We are drifting on the deep sea
And I can never get the stars like my father
Oh we're drifting out to sea into deep water
Oh we're drifting out to sea into deep water
Oh we're drifting out to sea into deep water
Oh we're drifting out to sea into deep water
