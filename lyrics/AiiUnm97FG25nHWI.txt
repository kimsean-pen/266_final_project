Your voice is thunder
Pounding on my soul
My voice is rain
We're going under
Nothing will remain
We'll be the hurricane
We'll be the hurricane

And I can't calm you down
Though I try and try in vain
And you can't keep me down
But I'll try to share your pain
And we'll never back down
We'll let it storm and rain
We'll be the hurricane
We'll be the hurricane
We'll be the hurricane

You gathered all the clouds
Safely overhead
I try in vain
Still we're going under
Nothing will remain
We'll be the hurricane
We'll be the hurricane

And I can't calm you down
Though I try and try in vain
And you can't keep me down
But I'll try to share your pain
And we'll never back down
We'll let it storm and rain
We'll be the hurricane

All the times that I nearly broke your heart
All the times that we nearly fell apart
Let it thunder over me my love
Please let it thunder over you

All the times that I tried to make you scream
All the anger and trouble to redeem
Let it thunder over me my love
Please let it thunder over you
Let it thunder over you
Let it thunder over

And I can't calm you down
Though I try and try in vain
And you can't keep me down
But I'll try to share your pain
And we'll never back down
We'll let it storm and rain
We'll be the hurricane
We'll be the hurricane
