Everybody told me Gem stuff's dangerous
I guess I didn't believe it until now
Dad always seemed apprehensive
And now he's really freaking out
What do I do?
I don't want that for you
Everybody tells me life is precious
On the planet Earth, and that means you
And I have to protect you
What if somehow you get hurt
What do I do?
I don't want that for you
Woooh...
Woooh...
Woooh...
Woooh...
What am I going to tell you?
You're better off not knowing the trouble I'm in,
I don't want you to worry about what I've just seen,
About where I've just been
You don't have to be a part of this
I don't think I want you to be
You don't need this
You don't need me
Woooh...
Woooh...
Woooh...
Woooh...
Woooh...
Woooh...
Woooh...
Woooh...
