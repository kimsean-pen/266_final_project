I am a blue blood
I will admit that
I dance in blue shoes and wear a blue hat
Live in a blue house
On a blue street
In a blue town
By a blue creek
I write my blue songs
With my blue pen
I sing the blue notes
To my blue friends
Now I don't that much about you
But I like you
Because you're true blue

I had a blue dream
About a blue star
In it I drove there
In my blue car and when I got there
I met a blue dog
With a blue tongue
We had some real fun
We bounced a blue ball
It broke a blue glass
We banged on blue drums and call it blue grass
I guess the thing I'm trying to tell you
Is that it's best, kid
If you're true blue

Once I had gangrene
I got it real bad
So the doc came with his black bag
I said 'You know, Doc, I dont feel swell,
if you had a blue bag, I think I'd get well.'
So he came right back
With a blue sack
He said 'Will this do?'
I said 'Why not, Yeah"
That's why im here today
To tell you
That it's best, man
To be true blue

Out on the blue sea
I sailed a blue ship
I had a first mate
Always had blue lips
His name was Bluebeard
He had a weird twitch
He flew a blue flag
On a big stick
And we ate blue gill and we ate blue chips
Oh I felt real blue, eating that blue fish
Because there ain't much that I won't do
Unless it keeps me from being true blue

Once in a blue moon
There's a blue sky
I wear my blue jeans and fly my blue kite
Thing's like a bluebird, until the wind dies
And then the tears pour
Out of my blue eyes

If it's your birthday
We'll bake a blue cake
And then we'll eat it off these blue plates
'Cause kid I don't know much about about you
But I like you
Because you're true blue

Yeah I don't know much about you
But I like you 'cause you're
True!
Blue!
