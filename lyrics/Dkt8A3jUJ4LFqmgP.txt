Nevermind the face you put on
In front of me
Nevermind the pain
That you've put me through

Cause every little thing you say
And every little thing you do
Makes me doubt all of this
What are you waiting for?

Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Well it's not me... no

Look what you did
Is this how you wanted this to be?
This life you gave away
Was meant for me
Forget about this trip that you've been on
Or so it seems
Nevermind the lies you told, not truths

Cause every little thing you said
And every little thing you did
Made me doubt all of this
Is that what are you waiting for?

Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Well it's not me, no

Look what you did
Is this how you wanted this to be?
This life you gave away
Was meant for me
Yeah...
Was meant for me
Is meant for me...
yeah, yeah
Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Well it's not me

Look what you did
Is this how you wanted this to be?
This life you gave away
Was meant for me
I don't know how I can face this pain
I'll keep it inside so you can't see
I don't think I can go on this way, 'cause it's not me
