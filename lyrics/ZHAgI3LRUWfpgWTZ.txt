My mind is spun
I've had enough
Feels like I'm burning down the flames rise up
And I can't tell what's coming next
Feels life is like a game of roulette

The one that I need
Help me see beyond the surface
My purpose

You were my North-star
You were my always
You were my god bless
Now I turn sideways
Maybe you turn to ashes, ashes
When it all comes down
When it all comes down

A cold wind sets, upon my back
The sky is getting full and turning black
I lost my way
When I lost you
I need a moment more, this can't be true

The one that I need
Help me see beyond the surface
My purpose

You were my North-star
You were my always
You were my god bless
Now I turn sideways
Who do you turn too
What can you say
Ashes, ashes it all comes down

It all comes down
It all comes down
Ashes, ashes
Ashes, ashes
When it all comes down
When it all comes down
Who do you turn too
When it all comes down

When it all comes down
Ashes, ashes
Ashes, ashes

Who do you turn too
When it all comes down
