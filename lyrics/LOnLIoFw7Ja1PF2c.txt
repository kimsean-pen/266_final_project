This world can't hold us, you can't mess with soldiers
There's no cell big enough to hold us
We came to be a wrecking ball to these boulders
Know this, I ain't scared of these cobras
Over time, they've tried to just fold us
They thought they could mess with this focus
But there's no room for these locusts
‘Cause real faith's belief without borders
Hold this

We yell, but no one hears
We persevere, as we approach the line
We march, for all those fears, that kept us here
This time they're left behind

Acting like they don't notice
But they're just mad because they can't mold us
Told you never underestimate soldiers
‘Cause you can build a thousand walls
You can't hold us

If we just keep running away
We'll never make it alive
Until we stand and we fight
Aim, fire, and blow it away
We're storming enemy lines
Leaving no one behind

This rock can't hold us
‘Cause the light has shown us
No fear's big enough to own us
We were never meant to fit in these folders
Know this, I ain't scared of these posers
Over time we all face opponents
They thought they could mess with this focus
They forgot, the end of the climb's the coldest, known as
Life's a battlefield of moments, hold this

We yell, but no one hears
We persevere, as we approach the line
We march, for all those fears, that kept us here
This time they're left behind

Acting like they don't notice
But they're just mad because they can't mold us
Told you never underestimate soldiers
‘Cause you can build a thousand walls
You can't hold us

If we just keep running away
We'll never make it alive
Until we stand and we fight
Aim, fire, and blow it away
We're storming enemy lines
Leaving no one behind

If we just keep running away
We'll never make it alive
Until we stand and we fight
Aim, fire, and blow it away
We're storming enemy lines
Leaving no one behind

If we just keep running away
We'll never make it alive
Until we stand and we fight
Aim, fire, and blow it away
We're storming enemy lines
Leaving no one behind
