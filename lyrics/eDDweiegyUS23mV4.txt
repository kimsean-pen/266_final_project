Let's go to the edge of disaster
Push the pedal and go a little faster
Let's slam into a wall at ramming speed
Let's go to the edge of a mountain
Jump off and lets start countin'
Hit the ground and tell me if it bleeds

Let's go insane
Let's go insane

Let's go to the edge of reality
Let's go for total insanity
Let's go for a government based on greed
Let's go for the final attack
Let's go for a war in Iraq
Let's go for starting up World War III

Let's go insane
Let's go insane
Make my reservation

Let's go for the ultimate crime
Let's go for the end of time
Let's go for an ethnic cleansing spree
Let's go for the final battle
Let's slaughter them all like cattle
Let's go to our graves in victory
Let's go insane
Let's go insane
Let's go!...insane
