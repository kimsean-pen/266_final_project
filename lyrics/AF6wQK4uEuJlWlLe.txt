The framework of the world
Is black and white
The infrastructure builders
Flex their might

Turning true emotion
Into digital expression
One by one we all fall down

The gray race shrivels
Trapped inside the world it creates

It's black and white

The perputual destructive
Motion machine
Began to chart a course
Never before seen

Turning raw compassion
Into fields of plus and minus
one by one we all give in

The gray race shrivels
Trapped inside the world it creates
It's black and white

I'd swear there were times when I was someone else
A person with determination and knowledge of the self
But you flattened me to rubble and now I can see that I'm
Just a faded negative of the image I used to be

And that's our dilemma
