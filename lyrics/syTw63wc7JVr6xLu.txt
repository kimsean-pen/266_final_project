I think I found hell
I think I found something
I think I found something in my TV screen
I think I found out
That I have nothing

That I have nothing in this place for me

I watched it all in my head
Perfect sense
They'll take me from my bed
Leave everything that is worth a single cent
And just take me instead
That TV show
I saw as I fell asleep

Had me on both knees
Praying to whatever is in heaven
Please, send me felon

Don't let the police know

Anything
Anything
Don't tell them anything, anything
Please
Anything

Anything
Don't tell them anything, anything
Please, oh!

I think I can tell
I think I can tell them

Tell them they were made for me
I'm thinking they'll know
Know it already
I'm thinking they'll know just about everything

I bet they planned it all out
Like the shows
Went everywhere I go
Walked in the store right behind me
Stood in line right beside me

And followed me to my home
I'm sure they figured it out
Early on
That I would never run
That they could shoot, but that's no fun

'Cause then they're killing their stolen son, oh

Anything
Anything
Don't tell them anything, anything

Please
Anything
Anything
Don't tell them anything, anything
Please

Anything (we're gonna die, die, die)
Anything (die, die, die)
Don't tell them anything, anything (die, die, die)
Please (die, die...)
Anything (we're gonna die, die, die)
Anything (die, die, die)
Don't tell them anything, anything (die, die, die)
Please (die, die...)
We're gonna die, die, die
Die, die, die
Die, die, die
We're gonna die, die, die
Die, die, die
Die, die, die
I think I found love...
