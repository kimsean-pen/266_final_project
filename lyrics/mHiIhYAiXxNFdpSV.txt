You don't have to cry yourself to sleep at night with wet pillows
Girl I know you're hurt
Did you know that you can dry your pillows
With your dreams and smile and your words
Lay your head down in my arms
Oh, I know you were
So just reach inside your heart
And pack your bags
And let's leave this earth

Let's aim high, oh
All you gotta do is close your eyes
And held the sign, visualize
Let's aim high

You work so hard for you boss
To him, it's just words
Never considers your dreams, selfish and mean
Down, it's gotta hurt
Just lay your head down in my arms
Girl, I know you were
So let me to abduct your mind with these words
Open your eyes, you're now a bird

Let's aim high, oh
All you gotta do is close your eyes
And held the sign, visualize
Let's aim high

You possess the power to do
If you concentrate mountains move
If you just believe that it's true
Please make no mistake
I'll be there too
You possess the power to do
If you concentrate mountains move
If you just believe that it's true
Make no mistake
I'll be there too
Oh, oh
Let's aim high
