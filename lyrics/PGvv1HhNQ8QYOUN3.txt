What more can I possibly say
I've got a problem in here, upon your soul I pay
This song's your price to be, you just can't relate
But as I've fallen, you will never be able to take

But if you think you can, then step up to plate

First you see it, then you don't believe it
Then you're gonna be there to question why
Why am I the one who has to suffer, getting crucified
Circle of fate, we're getting colder and we're not going back
Now we're getting older, moving forward, we aren't giving up

I am your fucking savior
I am the fucking antichrist

Do you think you could enter the nightmare
Open your eyes wide, no one cares
But if you think you can, then step up to plate

First you see it, then you don't believe it
Then you're gonna be there to question why
Why am I the one who has to suffer and be crucified
Circle of fate, we're getting colder (for getting cold as fuck)
Now we're getting older, moving forward, we aren't giving up

The critics and comments, the press and the nonsense
The fans who feel cheated, and venues I damaged
The people who left me, and ones who I banished
Fuck it, I'm done. I've got one thing to say...
Hate me if it makes you feel better!

Go!

I am your fucking savior
I am the fucking antichrist
I am the one and only answer
I am the fucking antichrist

Hate me if it makes you feel better
You can hate me if it makes you feel better
