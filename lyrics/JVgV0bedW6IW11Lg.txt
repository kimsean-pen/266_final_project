Started with a prayer and a big dream
Think I was about like seventeen
Underrated, understated, never seen
Big mind, small town, man I had to leave
Charcoal skinned kid flame gasoline
Blessed by the almighty Elohim

So blame fire, blame fire, blame fire,
blame fire, blame fire, blame fire, blame fire, blame fire
Blame
So blame fire, blame fire, blame fire,
blame fire, blame fire, blame fire, blame fire, blame fire
Blame
So blame fire, blame fire, blame fire,
blame fire, blame fire, blame fire, blame fire, blame fire
Blame

Yeah, we need to realize that our skin is a blessing
Fuck a curse

My daddy was a politician, my mother had the supervision
Talk about a coalition, talk about a coalition
She said, "The fire's burning in your eyes."
She said, "The fire's burning in your eyes."

So blame fire, blame fire, blame fire,
blame fire, blame fire, blame fire, blame fire, blame fire
Blame
So blame fire, blame fire, blame fire,
blame fire, blame fire, blame fire, blame fire, blame fire
Blame

Yeah

Refugees on a mission, don't believe the television
Ammunition, ammunition, did you really need more ammunition
Click clack, click clack
But you know, but you know, but you know, but you know now
Congolese kid with some big dreams
You aim higher
When they try to tell you you'll never be, just aim higher
Elevation, elevation, elevation, but still higher
Ahh--ah-oh
Oh-oh

So blame fire, blame fire, blame fire,
blame fire, blame fire, blame fire, blame fire, blame fire
Blame
So blame fire, blame fire, blame fire,
blame fire, blame fire, blame fire, blame fire, blame fire
Blame
