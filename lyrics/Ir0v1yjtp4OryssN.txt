Contamination
Numbness
Throttling in the blackened river
Of time and insane
Swallowed again
Drown again and
Deranged parasites
And a metallic green odor
So full the emptiness
Aimless
Withered scales decorate it's
Skin and it's falling away
Twist and writhe serpentine
Treason and peril
Thrust down the kill
It's eyes gaze animus
Are again as before
Dead except the eyes
Treason and peril.
