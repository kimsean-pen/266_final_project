I feel alone
I can't go back
What have I done?
I hear you out
Behind the wall
Below the sun

You feel it closing in
Never gonna see you again
That's never gonna change

You let me down
You let me down
You let me down
You let me down

Again

You feel it closing in
Never gonna see you again
That's never gonna change

You let me down
You let me down
You let me down
You let me down
You let me down
You let me down
You let me down

You let me down again!
