I went upstairs to pack my leavin trunk
I aint see no blues, whiskey made me sloppy drunk
I aint never seen no whiskey, the blues made me sloppy drunk
Im going back to Memphis babe, where Ill have much better luck

Lookout Mama you know you asked me to be your King
She said you kiddin man, if you want it, keep it hid
But please dont let my husband, my main man catch you here
Please dont let my main man, my husband catch you here

The blues are mushed up into three different ways
One said go the other two said stay
I woke up this mornin with the blues three different ways
You know one say go "baby I want to hang up", the other two said stay

Lead 1

Wake up mama I got something to tell you
You know Im a man who love to sing the blues
Now you got to wake up baby, mama now, I got something; I got something to tell you
Well you know Im the man, oh yes and I love to sing the blues

Come on baby, Come on

Lead 2

I went upstairs to pack my leavin trunk, you know
I aint see no blues or whiskey made me sloppy drunk
I aint never seen no whiskey, the blues made me sloppy drunk
I go home baby and I lay down on the lawn
