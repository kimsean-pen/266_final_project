Winter sleep, winter sleep
Take another nap until the frost is gone
Winter sleep, winter sleep
And dream that it's never been cold
Winter sleep, winter sleep
Now is not the time to live an honest life
Winter sleep, winter sleep
A grave inside the mouth of the snow
I could always sing along
Say that I feel just like the song
But it won't work this time
It won't work this time
Now it's obvious to me
Life isn't like the melody
It won't work this time
It won't work this time, for me
Winter sleep, winter sleep (try not to fall asleep)
The music ends and silence takes the sun away
Winter sleep, winter sleep (try not to fall asleep)
I'll tuck myself in and wait this out
I could always sing along
Say that I feel just like the song
But it won't work this time
It won't work this time
Now it's obvious to me
Life isn't like the melody
It won't work this time
It won't work this time, for me
What's it going to take to wake me up?
You could try and sing along
Say that you feel just like the song
But it won't work this time
It won't work this time
And you cry because you see:
Life isn't like the melody
That won't work this time
That won't work this time, for you
