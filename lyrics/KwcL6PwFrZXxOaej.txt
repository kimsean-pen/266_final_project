Is your lover
playing on your side?
Said he loves you
But he ain't got time
Here's the answer
Come and get it
At a knocked down price

(Hey!)

Full of honey
Just to make him sweet
Crystal balling
Just to help him see
What he's been missing
So come and get it
While you've still got time

(Hey!)

Get your boy on his knees
And repeat after me, say

Take a sip of my secret potion
I'll make you fall in love
For a spell that can't be broken
One drop should be enough
Boy, you belong to me
I got the recipe and it's called Black Magic
(And it's called Black Magic)

Take a sip of my secret potion
One taste and you'll be mine
It's a spell that can't be broken
And'll keep you up all night
Boy, you belong to me
I got the recipe and it's called Black Magic
(And it's called Black Magic)

If you're lookin'
For Mr. Right
Need that magic
To change him over night

While you've still got time
