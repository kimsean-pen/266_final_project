I look at her and she looks at me
In her eyes I see the sea
I can't see what she sees in a man like me
She says she loves me
Her eyes
Her eyes
Her eyes are a blue million miles
Far as I can see
She loves me
Her eyes
Her eyes
Her eyes are a blue million miles
Far as I can see
She loves me
I look at her and she looks at me
In her eyes I see the sea
I can't see what she sees in a man like me
She says she loves me
Her eyes
Her eyes
Her eyes are a blue million miles
