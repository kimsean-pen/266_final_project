you take me somewhere I belong / find me bound into my wrongs
I know it from a long dream / we moved into the sunset
I reveled in your heartbeat / do you know. . .

you give me a feeling?
you give me a feeling?
you give me a feeling?

you save me, save me from my worst
read me, like you knew me first
I'll take you to the ending / our faces in the nightglow
you take me somewhere I belong / find me bound into my wrongs
I know it from a long dream / we moved into the sunset
I reveled in your heartbeat / do you know. . .

you give me a feeling?
you give me a feeling?
you give me a feeling?

you save me, save me from my worst
read me, like you knew me first
I'll take you to the ending / our faces in the nightglow

you give me a feeling
you give me a feeling
you give me a feeling

this is a passing moment gone
this is your way of moving on
