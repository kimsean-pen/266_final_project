My resolution, Amen to you
Will you hear my confession as the truth?
Tell me what my penance should be
If you really love me, punish me

It's a beautiful disaster
It's a beautiful disaster

I get this feeling I can't miss
You're getting harder to resist
And maybe by the time I know
It'll be too late to let you go

Who knew my heart could beat so quick
My life I'd gave away for this
Don't care what anybody sees
I know I am doing this for me

All these people talking to themselves
Think they're talking to someone, but they're talking to themselves
Look at our love, you know that it's true
It can build us up, tear us down, but I'll be next to you

It's a beautiful disaster
It's a beautiful disaster

I get this feeling I can't miss
You're getting harder to resist
And maybe by the time I know
It'll be too late to let you go

Who knew my heart could beat so quick
My life I'd gave away for this
Don't care what anybody sees
I know I am doing this for me

I can be your butterfly
Love you so hard that I could die
One night can make it worth it all
What a beautiful way to fall

It's a beautiful disaster
Beautiful disaster

I get this feeling I can't miss
You're getting harder to resist
And maybe by the time I know
It'll be too late to let you go

Who knew my heart could beat so quick
My life I'd gave away for this
Don't care what anybody sees
I know I am doing this for me

Beautiful disaster
It's a beautiful disaster

It's a beautiful disaster
It's a beautiful disaster
