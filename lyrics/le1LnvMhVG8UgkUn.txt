Cloudy days lift my head up
I've always taken to the rain
I don't like sunny weather
I prefer the overcast haze
I keep quiet
I take to the rain
Light shines in through the window
I think we should close all the blinds
I feel safer in shadows
Insecurities leave me shy
I keep to myself, it's comforting
I spend time by myself, no company
