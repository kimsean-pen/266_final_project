When you're tired of waiting
And time is not on your side
When you're tired of hating me
You no longer want to hide

You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife

And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh

When there's trouble admitting
That you have been wrong all along
When the words you have written down
Reads "Everything is gone"

You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife

And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh

And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh

When you smother your friendships
And take much more than you need
When you can't keep a secret to yourself
And points to the source of the deed

You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife

And you can never find your satisfaction
When you can't outgrow your false distractions
You know your soul is weighed on the silver scale
Of deceit and lies
