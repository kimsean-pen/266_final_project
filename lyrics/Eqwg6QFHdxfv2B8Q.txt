Underneath a cool lampshade, I was lying to your face,
I didn't steal your liquor, maybe we just have the same taste
It was a birthday party, we were screaming happy birthday
I'd already ruined your night, you didn't even know my name

Oh, what a way for us to start
Take it as a sign you shouldn't trust me with your heart
Why d'you wanna go and be my friend?
I'm only gonna ruin your night again.

Stirrin' up a hurricane, oh it is a losing game
You should just forget my name oh
Stirrin' up a hurricane, I'm gonna ruin your night again

Underneath an empire state, we were tempting fate
Took a train into the city, wanna meet me at my place
We go to your best friend's show
Yeah I think I like you I'm not gonna let you know

Oh, what a way for us to be
Whisper and you ask where do I wanna sleep
Oh, why d'you wanna go and be my friend?
Don't you know how this is gonna end?

Stirrin' up a hurricane, oh it is a losing game
You should just forget my name oh
Stirrin' up a hurricane, I'm gonna ruin your night again

I'm only gonna ruin your night again
I'm only gonna ruin your night

And when I do, oh, will you forgive me?
If I tell you that I'm sorry would you stay here with me?
Going round in circles, how d'you think it's gonna end?
I'm gonna ruin your night again

Stirrin' up a hurricane, oh it is a losing game
You should just forget my name oh
Stirrin' up a hurricane, I'm gonna ruin your night again

Stirrin' up a hurricane, oh it is a losing game
You should just forget my name oh
Stirrin' up a hurricane, I'm gonna ruin your night again
