I gotta gotta take a trip, gotta take a trip out of this place
I gotta gotta get away, get away from the human race
I don't know what I'll see, don't even know what I'll find
I don't know what to pack, never been to a trip at the mind

Chorus:
Trip at the brain, trip at the brain, trip at the brain -
Do you know what I'm saying
Trip at the brain, trip at the brain, trip at the brain -
Well, I'm going insane

I took a wrong turn and ended up at my heart
It could barely even pump no blood it was so thrashed and torn apart
Thank it for working overtime in pain and misery
Then I set back on the trail, headed for my destiny

Chorus

Fly with me
Flying free

Tripping
You must be tripping
Trip, trip, tripping

I cannot stop this trip, I forgot to pack the brakes
Crashed straight into a concrete wall of my mistakes
Ended up in a cemetary of a thousand wasted days
But that's alright with me, cause that's where most of my memories lay

(Major tripping which you'll just have to listen to)
