One day, you came to me
Freed me from misery
I touched the music in you
You started to feel so happy
Makes me jump up and down
You know my heart gets a beat
Each time that we meet
I am so happy I met you

Happy
I am feeling so happy
I'm gonna go happy
You make me so happy
Can't you see I'm happy now

One day, you said to me
Happy is where I wanna be
One plus one makes it two
That equals me and you
Each time we make love
Until the day I met you
All of my dreams came true
I am so happy I met you

Happy
I'm feeling so happy
I'm gonna go happy
I'm gonna be happy
Can't you see I'm happy now

I know I want to be happy one day with you
Now I want to be happy with you my baby
My baby, my baby...
Happy
I'm gonna be happy
I'm gonna be happy
Can't you see I'm happy now
