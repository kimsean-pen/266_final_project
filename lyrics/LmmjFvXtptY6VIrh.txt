Lying awake dead of night
And eyes that never close
Flowers decay
A still life calls for a change

I can't wait, forever
I can't wait, forever

Miles away dead of night
And it's quiet as the grave
When there's more in your head
Than you find in your life, it calls for a change

I can't wait, forever

And the days and the hours
And the years keep turning in my mind
I've been waiting forever
