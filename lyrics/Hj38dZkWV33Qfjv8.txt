Am I cursed, or did I do this to myself?
Circling around and around
Like a saint that never closes its eyes, you deny
With your hands held tight you avoided the light

I drank from the cup of eternal disease
I once was a blind man but now I can see

I should've known you were the lord of flies
Looking for Heaven in the Devil's eyes
Guiding the stars to pave my own demise
I should've known you were the lord of flies

You're the worst, but I can see you in myself
Broken but enough is enough
Just a wretch that never opens its eyes, you deny
With a voice so loud permeating the night

I drank from the cup of eternal disease
I once was a blind man but now I can see

I'll never forgive
No, I'll never concede
The worst that you've done's still got nothing on me

I should've known you were the lord of flies
Looking for Heaven in the Devil's eyes
Guiding the stars to pave my own demise
I should've known you were the lord of flies

I should've known you'd fill my head with lies
I was looking for Heaven in the Devil's eyes

I should've known you were the lord of flies
I was looking for Heaven in the Devil's eyes
Guiding the stars to pave my own demise
I should've known you were the lord of flies
