It's all in motion, no stoppin' it now
I got nothing to lose and only one way up
I'm burning bridges, I destroy the mirage
All visions of collisions, fucking bon voyage

It's all smooth sailing
From here on out

I got bruises and hickies, stitches and scars
Got my own theme music, plays wherever I are
Fear is the hand that pulls your strings
A useless toy, pitiful plaything
I'm in flagrante
In every way
Every day

It's all smooth sailing
From here on out
I'm gon' do the damage
That needs getting done

Well, God only knows one long vacation
If reason is priceless there's no reason to pay for it
(It's so easy to see)
Yet so hard to find
Make a mountain of a mole hill, if...
If the mole hill is mine

I hypnotize you, ignore, then defy you
I blow my load over the status quo, here we go
I'm a little bit nonchalant when I dance
I'm risking it all-ways, no second chance

It's gonna be smooth sailing
From here on out
I'm gon' do the damage
'Til the damage is done

Well, God only knows so mind your behavior
Follow prescriptions of your, loaded savior
(Every temple is gold) Every hook is designed
Hell is at the temple of the closed mind...
Closed mind...
Closed mind...
Closed mind...

It's all smooth sailing
From here on out
Shut up

Pow!
