I want you to know
I have never felt
like this way before
so indifferent.

I want you to see
how it makes me happy
when you start falling
back to me... back to me.

all of the things you said that you are
oh my love
every time you said you will try
oh my love
everything's gone and i don't want it back
oh my love
can you see what have you done

i want you to feel
everything i have been through
stalk my every move
but I escape you

are you running?
are you making a new move
please just leave me and move on

all of the things you said that you are
oh my love
every time you said you will try
oh my love
everything's gone and i don't want it back
oh my love
can you see what have you done

you think that i want you back
i don't
i feel so lucky now
after you're gone

all of the things you said that you are
oh my love
every time you said you will change
oh my love
everything's gone and i don't want it back
oh my love
can you see what have you done
can you see what have you done.
