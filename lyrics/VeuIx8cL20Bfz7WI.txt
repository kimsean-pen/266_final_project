Watch my back cause it will be in a grave next week.
Watch my back cause it will be in a grave next week.
Who's to know, who's to calculate.
Life is meant to love and make mistakes.
If I ever had a side that could bold face lie
and get away with it every time.
It would be the man inside my head
Am I here or lost again?
I keep telling myself this isn't how the story ends.

I've come to paint the sky white and black
and when the morning comes I won't be looking back.
I know there's still beauty in the colors left to see.
Somewhere inside I'll find the other half of me.
I'll find the other half of me.

The lines we break that make the shape of everyday routine.
A step above the waves and chaos is simply me.

Where's the heart and passion don't hold back.
The frames that make each day unique as we proceed.
Progress ahead the past cannot be lived again.
I keep telling myself this isn't how the story ends.

I've come to paint the sky white and black
and when the morning comes I won't be looking back.
I know there's still beauty in the colors left to see.
Somewhere inside I'll find the other half of me.
I'll find the other half of me.

Who's to know, who's to calculate.
It's the mystery.
Life is meant to love and make mistakes.

Your not lost, I'm not dead.
We are moving side by side.
Your not lost, I'm not dead.
We are looking straight ahead.
