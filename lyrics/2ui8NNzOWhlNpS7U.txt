I see you, in a lonely place
How can you be so blind?
You're still regretting the love you left, left behind
Oh darling, I've seen you go through a change
Sitting alone each night
Are you expecting to find a love, love that's right

Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
Girl you'll never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
Girl you think you're so wise

There are times, when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
I'll take my chances before they pass, pass me by

Oh darlin', there is a light that shines, special for you and me
You need to look at the other side
You'll agree

Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
You may never find a love that's right

Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
You may never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
You may never find a love that's right

Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
Girl you think you're so wise
You may never find a love that's right
