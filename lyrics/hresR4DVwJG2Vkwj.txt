My arms keep missing you
Who's been kissing you since you went away?
My arms keep missing you
I keep wishing you'd come back today

My arms keep missing you
Who's been kissing you since you went away?

You know I've been so lonely every night
Since you went away
Would you let me down any night
Is that the way you're made, girl?

I keep telling myself it's alright
Even though I cry
There's no question why
How could I be happy when

My arms keep missing you
Who's been kissing you since you went away?
My arms keep missing you
I keep wishing you'd come back today

You said you wouldn't hurt me any way
And I believed in you
We said we'd trust each other every day
We'd never be untrue

But I keep thinking you're telling lies
Even though I try
There's no question why
How can I be happy when

My arms keep missing you
Who's been kissing you since you went away?
My arms keep missing you
I keep wishing you'd come back today

Arms keep missing you

You know I've been so lonely every night
Since you went away
Would you let me down any night
Is that the way you're made, girl?

I keep telling myself it's alright
Even though I cry
There's no question why
How could I be happy when

My arms keep missing you
Who's been kissing you since you went away?
My arms keep missing you
I keep wishing you'd come back today

My arms keep missing you
Who's been kissing you since you went away?
My arms keep missing you
I keep wishing you'd come back today

My arms keep missing you
Who's been kissing you since you went away?
My arms keep missing you
I keep wishing you'd come back today

My arms keep missing you
Who's been kissing you since you went away?
