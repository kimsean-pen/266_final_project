I fell in love with you, still don't know why
We're total opposites, but you drive me wild
I tried to stop, I tried to hold back from
This obsession for you, but I can't turn it off
Oh, it's running in my veins, constantly on my brain
The thought of you just never goes away
Oh, I want you everyday
I want you every way
I'm addicted
And I know that you wanna let go
Yeah, I've seen the fear in your eyes
You think I'm way too crazy for you
But it's your voice that's making me so
When you're talking to me so low,
oh oh oh oh
When you're talking to me so low
I wanna do this right, don't go too fast
For once in my life make something last
More than the one night stands, they disappear
Just like names and faces, but I keep holding on to you
It's running in my face, constantly on my brain
The thought of you just never goes away
Oh, I want you everyday
I want you every way
I'm addicted
And I know that you wanna let go
Yeah, I've seen the fear in your eyes
You think I'm way too crazy for you
But it's your voice that's making me so
When you're talking to me so low
oh oh oh oh
When you're talking to me so low
oh oh oh oh
When you're talking to me so low
Well, you wanna let go
Yeah, I've seen the fear in your eyes
You think I'm way too crazy for you
But it's your voice that's making me so, so, so
Know that you wanna let go
Yeah, I've seen the fear in your eyes
You think I'm way too crazy for you
But it's your voice that's making me so
When you're talking to me so low
oh oh oh oh (Making me so)
When you're talking to me so low
oh oh oh oh
When you're talking to me so low
oh oh oh oh
When you're talking to me so low
