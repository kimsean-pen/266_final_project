You say "I'd best be going 'cause it's getting late"
And I say "Why don't I walk you homem 'cause it's on the way"
But the last time that we made love, you left in tears
So this time you're wondering how to leave it here

And I haven't seen you since last winter break
And I know that I broke your heart
But always such a smart one, always so intelligent
You must know that I took it hard

Oh, baby I think we both know
This is a love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you want it
I know I'll always have one more try

Oh, baby I think we both know
This is a love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you want it
I know I'll always have one more try

You pull that face like "here we go again"
So I pull a flask out the back of my jeans
And then you take a pull
And in my mind we're in my bed
And I'm pulling your sweater up over your head

And I haven't seen you since last winter break
And I know that you hate how that went
But aways such a smart one, always so intelligent
You must know what's happening

Oh, baby I think we both know
This is a love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you want it
I know I'll always have one more try

Oh, baby I think we both know
This is a love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you want it
I know I'll always have one more try

Oh it's magnetic, isn't it?
The sense of something underneath the surface
When you're laying on thin ice
Just a little bit masochistic
A tentative ellipsis
The parting of your lips and the ache in your eyes
But I think I'm gonna kiss you

All despite what we both know
This is a love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you want it
I know I'll always have one more try

Oh, baby I think we both know
This is a love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you want it
I know I'll always have one more try
