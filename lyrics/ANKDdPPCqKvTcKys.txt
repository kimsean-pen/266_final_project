Walking down the road
With your pistol in your waist
Johnny you're too bad

Walking down the road
With your ratchet in your waist
Johnny you're too bad

You're just robbing and you're stabbing and you're looting and you're shooting
Now you're too bad
You're just robbing and you're stabbing and you're looting and you're shooting
Now you're too bad

One of these days
When you hear a voice say come
Where you gonna run to

One of these days
When you hear a voice say come
Where you gonna run to

You're gonna run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock
You're gonna run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock

Walking down the road
With a pistol in your waist
Johnny, you're too bad

Walking down the road
With a ratchet in your waist
Johnny you're too bad

You're just robbing and you're stabbing and you're looting and you're shooting
Now you're too bad
You're just robbing and you're stabbing and you're looting and you're shooting
Now you're too bad

One of these days
When you hear a voice say come
Where you gonna run to

One of these days
When you hear a voice say come
Where you gonna run to

You're gonna run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock
You're gonna run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock
You're gonna run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock
