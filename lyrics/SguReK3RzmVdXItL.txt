Celebrating life alone
tight with one single stone.
Engravings and heart for soul
singing out with the folks.
I am down with my corpse alone
the graveyard is my home.
So I don't need your precious rose, 'cause I'm already in the mud.

I'm looking over people.
They are stadning with tears in their eyes.
I'm laughing about my own nest.
Is this really how things turned out?
It ain't so easy for me now
as they are holding a speech for me.
It ain't so easy for me now
as I am dead as I should be.
