There's a cemetery deep below the sea.
There the space is reserved for fools like me.
I tried to kill myself at least a dozen times
But nothing seemed to turn out right.

Now I'd rather wait a half a century.
Soiling the bed, all belligerent and wrinkly.
Even when I go blind and lose my mind
And nothing seems to turn out right,

Something's got to turn out right.

If you want then when we die,
We'll ascend to someplace way up high.
At the gate they'll show you through.
If they ask me, I'm with you.

You're in my body.
You're, you're in my body.
You're in my body.
That's where I think about you.

(You're in my body and that's where I think about you)
...in my body.
You're, you're in my body.
You're in my body.
That's where...

There's no one who imagines like you,
So convinced there's somewhere that we got to,
Not a first-class trip to the abyss.
Tell me, do you still feel this?
Tell me, do you still feel this?

As I drown in lakes of fire,
I will call your name as I expire.
It's the last thing that I'll do.
I will tell them I'm with you.

You're in my body.
You're, you're in my body.
You're in my body.
That's where I think about you.

(You're in my body and that's where I think about you)
...in my body.
You're, you're in my body.
You're in my body.
That's where...

Falling asleep, asleep at the wheel.
As I approach that cliff, I'm starting to feel.
If you could wake me up with only your touch,
Then I could die with you and life would be enough

Falling asleep, asleep at the wheel.
As I approach that cliff, I'm starting to feel.
If you could wake me up with only your touch,
Then I could die with you and life would be enough
(Wake me up)

And I'll face the one who made
My disgusting heart from a lump of clay.
Should he ask what got me through;
If he asks me it was you.

You're in my body.
You're, you're in my body.
You're in my body.
That's where I think about you.

(You're in my body and that's where I think about you)
...in my body.
You're, you're in my body.
You're in my body.
That's where I think about you!

(You're in my body and that's where I think about you)
...in my body.
You're, you're in my body.
You're in my body.
That's where I think about you
