Think back on every word you said
These days are good as gold
So I will never let go

Can we remember the time it took to get me here
Or the sudden change that turns the spring to fall
I've been missing you for so long
These words of broken tensions left me dry
And the illuminations die at your front lawn
I've been missing you for so long, so long

You know I'd love to call in catch up
But I know, yeah, I know

Think back on every word you said
These days are good as gold
So I will never let go
And we saw the summers slip away
From calendar days, from calendar days

I still believed you can't wilt without the sun
But I couldn't be more wrong
Cause sunny spots of light lean through the clouds
(So dim and desolate)
A sky is as gradient as wind
But I don't feel any different
No I don't feel any different

Think back on every word you said
These days are good as gold
So I will never let go
And we saw the summers slip away
From calendar days, from calendar days

You know I'd love to call in catch up
But I know
That if you wanted to know how I've been
You would've asked
Yeah if you wanted to know how I've been
You would've asked
You never ask

And we saw the summers slip away
From calendar days, from calendar days
