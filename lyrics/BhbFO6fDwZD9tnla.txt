Let me take you to a place I know you want to go
it's a good life

I wanna stand around and beg you
just don't say no
no no
no no.
I have got a feeling that you're gonna like it

what I'm doing to you
And I know what I'm doing

I'll be doing what you want to me to do.
Love is shining
life is thriving in the good life

good life
Good life
good life
good life

good life
in the good life

good life.
A feeling that you get from the good life.

Once you get the good life feeling
Let me tell you no one can take it away
no no

no no.
No more bad times
only glad times in the good life
good life.
Good life
good life
good life

good life
in the good life

good life
Good life
good life
good life

good life
in the good life

good life.
When the good look in then it feels as good as a good life.
I want you to want me

I want the good life all night.
No more rainy days
the sun will chase the clouds away
in the good life.
Good life
good life
good life

good life

in the good life
Good life
good life
good life
good life
in the good life
good life.
No nore sorrow
nothing borrowed in the good life
good life
Good life
good life
good life
good life
in the good life
good life.
