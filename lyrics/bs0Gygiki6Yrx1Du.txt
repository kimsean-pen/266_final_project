Take in all the sunshine
Bottle up the rain
Go where the wind blows
Let it show the way

Open all the windows
Let in all the light
You can pull the stars down
Paint the perfect sky

So go and write your song
The world will sing along

Oh a-oh a-oh
Life's what you make it

Oh a-oh a-oh
It's yours for the taking

You can test the water
You might as well jump in
And we don't know where we'll end up
So you might as well begin

Memories your making
You frame inside in your heart
In the middle of a nowhere
Is a somewhere you can start

So go and write your song
The world will sing along

Oh a-oh a-oh
Life's what you make it

Oh a-oh a-oh
It's yours for the taking

Go and write your own song
All the world will sing along
When you find your melody
We'll join in, in harmony

Oh a-oh a-oh
Life's what you make it

Oh a-oh a-oh
Life's what you make it

Take in all the sunshine
Bottle up the rain
Go where the winds blows
Let it show the way

Oh a-oh a-oh
Life's what you make it

Oh a-oh a-oh
Life's what you make it

Oh a-oh a-oh
It's yours for the taking

Go and write your own song
All the world will sing along
When you find your melody
We'll join in, in harmony

Oh a-oh a-oh
Life's what you make it

Life's what you make it
