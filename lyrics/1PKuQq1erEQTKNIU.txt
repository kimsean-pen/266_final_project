These places I find myself in
Stand contradicting
These tradgedies of my own sin
I'm terrified of what's become of this
Put me into place or let me in
Let me in

Wait, is where we break down?
Is there nothing more to say,
After all?
Will we find resolution?
In what we've done
In what we've done

Into the memories long ago
Left unattended
Trapped in the past that we all know
Was better than this hell we've dove into
I'm sorry for the world I dragged you through
I dragged you through

Wait, is where we break down?
Is there nothing more to say,
After all?
Will we find resolution?
In what we've done
In what we've done

All the compromising makes me feel numb
As I stand on my pile of hope and lies
Could you grant me this peace of mind?
And I break away

Wait, is where we break down?
Is there nothing more to say,
After all?
Will we find resolution?
In what we've done
In what we've done
Is this where we break down?
Is there nothing more to say,
After all?
Will we find resolution?
In what we've done
In what we've done
