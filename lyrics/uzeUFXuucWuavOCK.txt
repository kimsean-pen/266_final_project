There was a soldier
War material
Under the rain
Soulkilling, complain
And life to sustain
Pain - no pain
There will be ructions
More rebellions
Looting, rout
He's afraid of such a waste

There was a soldier
Warm material
Under the sun
For old acquaintances' sake
Don't make such a mistake
Please - oh please
There will be ructions
More rebellions
Looting, rout
Drugs tell upon one in time
