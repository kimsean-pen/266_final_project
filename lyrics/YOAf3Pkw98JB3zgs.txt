Took a ride to the end of the line
Where no one ever goes
Ended up on a broken train
With nobody I know

But the pain and the longing's the same
When you're dying
Now I'm lost and I'm screaming for help

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm terrified
It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm playing with fire

Scared
It's as if I'm terrified
Are you scared?
Are we playing with fire?

Oh, there is an answer to the darkest times
It's clear, we don't understand it but the last thing on our mind

Is to leave you
I believe that we're in this together
Don't scream, there are so many roads left

Take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

It's as if I'm terrified
It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm playing with fire

Scared
It's as if I'm terrified
Are you scared?
Are we playing with fire?

Relax
Relax
