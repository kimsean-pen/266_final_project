You like New York City in the daytime
I like New York City in the nighttime
You say you like sleeping with the air off
I don't
I need it on

You like the light coming through the windows
I sleep late, so I just keep 'em all closed
You ignore the music on the radio
I don't
I sing-a-long

I don't ask for you to change
Baby, no no no
And you don't ask for me to change

Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well
And we don't even know why
Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well
And we don't even know why
You can call it fire and ice
But we work so well
And we don't even know why
We don't even know why, no no
We don't even know why, no no no

(No no, no no)
(No no, no no)

Cold outside and you're just in a t-shirt
I have cold blood even in a sweater
You start your night sippin' by the kilo
I don't
I know you know

I don't ask for you to change
Baby, no no no
And you don't ask for me to change

Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well
And we don't even know why
Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well
And we don't even know why
You can call it fire and ice
But we work so well
And we don't even know why
We don't even know why, no no
We don't even know why, no no no

(No no, no no)
We don't even know
We don't even know (no no, no no)
We don't even
No, no, no, no, no no, no no no

Somehow we end up on the same side
And you wouldn't think that we'd be alright
Even our eyes are different colors
But we see fine
Somehow we end up on the same side
And you wouldn't think that we'd be alright
Even our eyes are different colors
But we see fine

(Oh) Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well ('cause we work so well we don't even know why, why)
Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well
But we don't even know why

You can call it fire and ice
'Cause we work so well
And we don't even know why, why
We don't even know why, no no
We don't even know why, no no no

(No no, no no)
Oh
We don't even know why (no no, no no)
