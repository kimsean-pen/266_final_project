In a room with both of your idols
you were always turning around
what ya go, what ya get started
always had that look in your eyes
you would always reach without trying
--------- out for love
won't you take my chance on the weekends
you could always read me by heart

I know your still green
but i'll start you a scene as you grind
about when you come around
i know your still green girl
i'll start you a scene girl
always on the go, keep your head up high
"no, no not quite that high"
D-D-Dance dance dance til' you get it right
always on the go, keep your head up now

You would be no shock just to heal up
you would always question my kind
watch you go, watch you go run off
watch you go, watch you get back

I know your still green
but i'll let you go queen on these 25's
enough tonight
i'll your still green girl
i'll let you go queen girl
always on the go, keep your head up high
"no, no not quite that high"
D-D-Dance dance dance til' you get it right
always on the go, keep your head up now

Always on the go
keep your head up now
D-D-Dance dance dance til' you get it right
D-D-Dance dance dance til' you get it right
D-D-Dance dance dance til' you get it right
D-D-Dance dance
D-D-Dance dance
D-D-Dance dance
D-D-Dance dance dance til' you get it right
D-D-Dance dance
D-D-D-Dance!

Always on the go, keep your head up high
"no, no not quite that high"
D-D-Dance dance dance til' you get it right
always on the go, keep your head up now

Always on the go, keep your head up high
"no, no not quite that high"
D-D-Dance dance dance til' you get it right
always on the go, keep your head up now

Always on the go, keep your head up now.
