Oh
Fuck the ancient ways
They are heretofore
Show no claim

Oh
Got the time, won't seek
They are oh still coming to beat the street
(At the station)

The city feeds us all like babes
And we've taken a bow (At the station)

Oh
Shape the fight of sound
Become beautifully bound
To pound

Oh
Fuck the ancient ways
They are ringing doorbells that let in my waste
(At the station)

The city needs us and all our rage
And surprise in your eyes (At the station)

What we need, this empire grows
Every stage we'll find (At the station)

To be beaten by the weight of it
They are to be beaten by the weight (At the station)

Come in people and enjoy the glow
Every change we allow (At the station)

The city sees us all like babes
And we've taken a bow (At the station)

To be beaten by the weight of it
They are beaten by the weight (At the station)

Should we seek them for the sake of it?
Nay, we greet them right away
