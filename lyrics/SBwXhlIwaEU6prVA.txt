Oh I love, love, I love
What you do to my head
Pull me upstairs
Push me to the bed
Love what you do to my head
It's a
Mess up there
Oh I love, love, I love
What you do to my heart
Pull me back down
And push me apart
Oh I love what you do to my heart

It's the best, oh yeah!

Oh I love, love, I love
What you do to my lips
Hold me aside
Something like this
What you do to my lips
It's so sweet in there
Oh I love, love, I love
What you do to my hips
Pull me outside
And then suck me like this

What you do to my hips
It's the beat, oh yeah!
You're the only one I cry for
The only one I die to squeeze

You're the only one I sigh for
You're the only one I try to please
And it gets better every day I say
With you it's such a scream
Yeah it gets wetter every day I say
With you it's such a dream

Yeah it gets meta every day I say
With you it's like a dream
Yeah
Oh I love, I love, I love
What you do to my skin
Slip me on
And slide me in
What you do to my skin
It's a
Blush on there
Oh I love, love, love
What you do to my bones

Pull me out, slide me home
What you do to my bones
It's a crush on me
You're the only one I'd die for

The only one I try to please
You're the only one I sigh for
The only one I die to squeeze
And it gets better every day I say
With you it's such a scream
It gets wetter every day I stay

With you it's such a dream
Better every day I say
With you it's like a dream
Oh I love, I love, I love
I love, I love, I love
I love, I love, I love
I love, I love
What you do to me
