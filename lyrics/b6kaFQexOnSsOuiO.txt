The war fell upon us when we least expected, our world's coming to an end.
I look out the door and see the city burning, our memories wrapped in flames.

But in the end it's just you and me, in the end it's just you I see.
When the pain grows stronger I'll find the cure in your eyes, and your eyes will be my guide.

I pick up the pieces of what's left of my life right after the lights go off;
Destroy every ounce of faith that's left within me,
I'm ready to let it go

'cause in the end it's just you and me,
In the end it's just you I see.
When the pain grows stronger I'll find the cure in your eyes, and your eyes will be my guide.

In the end it's just you and me,
In the end it's just you I see.
When the pain grows stronger I'll find the cure in your eyes, and your eyes will be my guide.
