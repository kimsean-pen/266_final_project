I am the silencer
I am the only one
To bring you home tonight
I lift you up, define you
Captured by the things that I do
Then I learned to wait for my life
The more I get the more that I'm
I am for myself
And yet the water flows on
Feeding the mud loves everyone
Forever Sink into the ground to below
The less you see is the less that you care on
I'll try and do face for now
Trying this new face that I can't see
Don't get me wrong now
It all falls on
Don't get me wrong now
It all falls on
