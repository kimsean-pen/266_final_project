Well I'm sorry that it's over
But I know no other way
You could leave it, or believe it
But there's nothing it would change

Well I tried to get away
But I just can't seem to lose the taste
Through virtue or through pain
These memories will make the man they break

Please don't leave me with no other way
Please just leave me alone
I'm trying to get lost
But I don't know the way
So please just leave me alone
Alone

Well I don't know you, but I owe you
So much more than can be paid
Self-defeated, and deleted
But through this I still remain

Well I tried to find a way
To resolve the past with life today
And all that I became
Is the best of what's been thrown away

Please don't leave me with no other way
Please just leave me alone
I'm trying to get lost
But I can't find the way
So please just leave me alone
Alone
Alone
