I can't seem to keep them in
I was happy
I was happy 'till the morning
But you love her and I love him
And this was never
This was never happening
In another life this could have been
In another life I let you in
But this was never
This was never happening
Every word under my skin
In a new day
In a new dawn let sleep in
'Cause you want her and I want him
And this was never
This was never happening
In another life this could have been
In another life I let you in
I can't seem to keep them in
I was happy
I was happy 'till the morning
This was never
This was never happening
I can't seem to keep them in
I was happy
I was happy 'till the morning
In another life this could have been
I was happy
I was happy 'till the morning
In another life this could have been
But this was never
This was never happening

Every word under my skin
I was happy
I was happy 'till the morning
But you love her and I love him
And this was never
This was never happening
