He says that
He tries to solve all
His problems as he's bringing me down
I just wait all around
Forgiveness is an empty thought
I find myself moving on
Moving on

He looks to my eyes once more
And gives me away like somebody's bride

I'm never going to think of him
That way again
Never going to think of him
That way again

He looks through and disappears
And I wonder if I'm still ashamed
I thought about it through and through
And it's just still the same

I'm never going to think of him
That way again
Never going to think of him
That way again
That way again
