Sole, contender
For what I believe to be
A mess
All I know
We never put it to the test (we never put it to the test)

You ask me if I
Want to dance some more (I tell you that I do)
I tell you that I do
You raise me up
Up to heights I never knew, yeah

Whoa-oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-oh

Won't you pinch me
I've been dreaming here
For far too long
Wide awake
We're sharing in this morning view

I ask you if you
Want to laugh some more (you tell me that you do)
You tell me that you do

I'll raise you up
Before we fall

When I say that you can count on me
It's true
But it seems to me that I can't count
On you

What are you waiting for
Waiting for
Waiting for

When it's gone we'll fake it
When it's over we can start

Silent roars
Will kill this curiosity
Devastation
Feels so natural
Right behind the wrecking ball
Securing insecurities

I wonder if we'll
Weather every storm
I'm hoping that we do
Mr. Invisible's been found

When I say that you can count on me
It's true
But it seems to me that I can't count
On you

What are you waiting for
Waiting for
Waiting for

What are you waiting for
Waiting for
Waiting for the day
To say, "It's over"

When all is said and done (said and done)
We've lost what we've become (we've become)
Just watched it slip away
Not ready for a change

When all is said and done (said and done)
Never forget where we came from (we came from)
Far before today
Now it's done

Weather every storm
I'm hoping that we do
Mr. Invisible's been found

When I say that you can count on me
It's true
But it seems to me that I can't count
On you

What are you waiting for
Waiting for
Waiting for

What are we waiting for
Waiting for
Waiting for

What are we waiting for
Waiting for
Waiting for
