Let's blaze!

We just got into town
And we've been driving all night
We've been gone for far too long
Now it's time for getting right

So, you know where to meet me
And you know just what I need
So, show me what I've been missing out on
And why I shouldn't leave

We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna burn this city down
We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna blaze till the morning sun

We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna burn this city down
We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna blaze till the morning sun

We're just now hitting the town
And we're taping off the streets
We've been driving all day and night
Tell me, were you waiting for me?

So, you know what's going down
And you know just what I need
So, show me what I've been missing out on
And why I should believe

We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna burn this city down
We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna blaze till the morning sun

We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna burn this city down
We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna blaze till the morning sun

We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna burn this city down
We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna blaze till the morning sun

We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna burn this city down
We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna blaze till the morning sun

We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna burn this city down
We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna blaze till the morning sun

We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna burn this city down
We're not gonna stop tonight
We're gonna blaze till the morning sun
