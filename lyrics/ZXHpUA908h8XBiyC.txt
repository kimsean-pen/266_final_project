I've been keeping my, keeping myself from you
Hoping you're, hoping you just come to
Holes in the bridge down in sun drifting fire,
This features go at least one it seems fine.

Morning and evening desire
Cutting this I'm in free at dawn.
Free at dawn, free at dawn,
Free at dawn.

Took a wall along appear alone
hypnotized by witness in the world
Just guiding mistakes made up another way
I was feeling reckless as rain.

Sparks.seem like
Awake I'm free at dawn.
Free at dawn, free at dawn,
Free at dawn, free at dawn.
Free at dawn, free at dawn,
Free at dawn.

Free at dawn.
Free at dawn.
