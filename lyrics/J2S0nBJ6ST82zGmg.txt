A stranger to most, but everyone knows his name
The city he wakes up in is never the same

It gets hard to count the days with only stars to lead the way and in his heart of gold he knows this has to change
So send me home

I have lost my way
and I don't even know if we'll make it through today
take another step
take another breath
I fill my lungs with the deepest of regrets
and I don't know if I'll make it home again

It gets a little harder day by day
The loneliness is swallowing me
I listen to the silence to hear what it might say

Who will pick me up again?
I need you here, I need a friend
We'll get lost on time that's stolen
So take my hand and send me home
I have lost my way
and I don't even know if we'll make it through today
take another step
take another breath
I fill my lungs with the deepest of regrets

And I don't know if I'll make it home again
take
take
take all that I've got
got
got
All I need is one more moment
I just have to end this torment
take
take
take all that I've got
We'll get lost on time that's stolen
Take my hand and lead me home again
Just take my hand
So send me home
I have lost my way and I don't even know if we'll make it through today
take another step, take another breath
I fill my lungs with the deepest of regrets
And I don't know if I'll make it home again
