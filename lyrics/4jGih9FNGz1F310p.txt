I can't keep myself from evil
I can't keep myself from evil
I can't keep myself from evil
I can't keep myself from evil

I can't keep myself from evil
I can't keep myself from evil
I can't keep myself from evil
I can't keep myself from evil

So much desire there left in me
So much perversion you can't see
So much desire there left in me
So much malignance you can't see

So much desire
So much desire
So much desire
So much desire

I can't keep myself from evil
I can't keep myself from evil
I can't keep myself from evil
I can't keep myself from evil

So much desire there left in me
So much perversion you can't see
So much desire there left in me
So much malignance you can't see

So much desire
So much desire
So much desire
So much desire

Keep me from the evil
