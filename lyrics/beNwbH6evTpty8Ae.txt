Dim is the light of a new day
In the land of the undying sun
Hollow the silence around me
Distant the sound of a gun

[Port Side is close to the shore]
I wonder where she is
[Incoming shot cross the bow]
Will she remember me

Wail my April moon
God forsaken soul
I remember you
Come with me tonight

Damned is the dawn of a new day
Revelations of death and despair
Frost misty waters around me
Frantic and naked the fear

[Port Side is close to the shore]
[Incoming shot cross the bow]

Wail my April moon
God forsaken soul
I remember you
Come with me tonight

Say your prayers
Loud and clearly
All who still believe in god

[Port Side is close to the shore]
[Incoming shot cross the bow]

Wail my April moon
God forsaken soul
I remember you
Come with me

Wail my April moon
God forsaken soul
(I remember you) I will remember you
(Come with me) tonight
