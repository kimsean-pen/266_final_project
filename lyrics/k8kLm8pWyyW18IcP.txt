Well, I know you don't particularly like me around
But I always hoped that I could change your mind
And I don't really even blame you for being so creeped out
I know I don't deserve your time

And I know that I'm supposed to stay a hundred yards away
But if you knew the awful truth, would you still feel the same?

What if I told you, you were the only girl that I ever thought about?
Every day, every moment beyond a shadow of a doubt
I know you think I'm a creep, but please believe I've got it all figured out
We were meant for each other beyond a shadow of a doubt

Don't call the cops on me, baby
Give me a chance to make you believe
Don't call the cops on me, baby
Give me the chance to make you believe
