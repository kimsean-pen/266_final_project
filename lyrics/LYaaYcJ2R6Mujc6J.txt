Like staring at a flickering light:
You don't know when it'll burn out, or how much time you have left to let it light up your life.
Because when you're at your darkest, it's all you have to survive.
Like throwing copper in a well:
You'll never know if wishes work only time can tell.
But if superstitions can give someone faith, then I'm throwing my wallet and begging for change.
