Pluck my silver stream
From your eye and thigh
And breathe in

And I can see through me
I can see through me

Pluck
My silver stream
From your eye and thigh
And breathe in

Tuck
That feeling in
As you gather up your clothes
This hotel's been too kind

Turn me blind, and a blind eye to my wretched kind

I'm no mystery to you no more
On this hollow floor

Pluck
My silver stream
From your eye and thigh
And breathe in

Tuck
(I can see through you)
That feeling in
(I can see through you)
As you pluck
(Hmmm)
My silver stream
(Hmmm)
And pluck
(I can see through you)
My silver stream
(I can see through you)
From your eye and thigh
(Hmmm)
And breathe in
(Hmmm)
Tuck
(I can see through you)
That feeling in
(I can see through you)
As you pluck
(Hmmm)
My silver stream
(Hmmm)
