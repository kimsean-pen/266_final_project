Ride to the land of secrets.
Find all the traces left behind...
With sword in hand the Covenant
A cross baptised in blood... the nectar of the Gods.
Might!
Making wrong to seem right.
Destroy all the traces left behind.
With sword in hand the Covenant
A cross baptised in blood.

The Vampire from Nazareth.

"For blood, is Life"

The Vampire from Nazareth.

The Templars march.
Waves of arms.
"We offer the Sun!"
The wolf is wearing the pelt of the lamb.

"We offer the Sun,
with thorns his crown.
We offer a son"

Ravens on the top... as angels fly.

"We offer the Sun,
with thorns his crown.
We offer a son

"We offer the Sun"
