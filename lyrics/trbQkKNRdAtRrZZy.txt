On my own
Sad when you're around
I think I lose myself
The second that I see her around

And not a day goes by
Oh no, I doubt
Time, time can't remember
What I'm thinking about
Cause when it's caught up
You're tangled in those dreams

I go uptown
On a quiet day
Just to gather my thoughts
When I don't know what to say

And we go outside
When the morning's dark
And we fall in the grass
Of an open park
And the sun will break
When our hands hit the tree

I am on time
Though I didn't try
And the second move slow
But the moments all too fast

And not a day goes by
Oh no, I doubt
Time, time can't remember
What I'm thinking about
Cause when it's caught up
You're tangled in those dreams

Daydream
