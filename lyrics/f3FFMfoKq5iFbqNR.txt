When you call my soul and how it lingers
Like water trembling in the Sun
Not know how it holds I'm taller
Now travel down the life's lonely way

All the memories feeling smaller
I will wear them all in sacred golden light
Now sail on, your dreams are waiting
On their way to
See how they
Run like the wind

As I ponder, my soul growing fonder
How you take my tears and dry them all
I will take your path
In the stillness of the night
Like a bird gliding over troubled sea

All the memories feeling smaller
I will wear them all in sacred golden light
Now sail on, your dreams are waiting
On their way to
See how they
Run like the wind
