Thrash!
Mosh!
I met a bird that
Came from hell
He is little green
He is very well
He likes to play
He likes the milk
He likes to fight
He likes to kill
I met a bird that
Came from hell
He is little green
He is very well
He cannot fly
And he is revolt
He don't like me
And then he told
What?!

Loro, loro quer biscoito!
Loro, loro quer biscoito!
Quer biscoito!!!
Evil papagali
He wants to kill
He ordered me to
Puta que pariu
Evil papagali
He is animal
He got the power
Of heavy metal
He's got the power
Of the furation
You feel the pain
Is the bication
He's master of hell
And we're Massacration
He wants to speak
To all the nation

Loro, loro quer biscoito!
Loro, loro quer biscoito!
Loro, loro quer biscoito!
Loro, loro quer biscoito!
Quer biscoito!!!

Curupaco feel the fire
Curupaco feel
Curupaco kill with power
Curupaco kill

Loro, (LORO!)
Loro quer biscoito!
Loro, (LORO!)
Loro quer biscoito!
Loro, (LORO!)
Loro quer biscoito!
Loro, (LORO!)
Loro quer biscoito!

Loro, Loro quer biscoito!
Loro, Loro quer biscoito!
