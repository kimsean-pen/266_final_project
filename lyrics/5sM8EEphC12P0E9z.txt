Can I wake you up, can I wake you up?

Is it late enough, is it late enough?

There's a story in which my eyes shut

Could you back me up, could you back me up?
Could you back me up?
There's a story in which my eyes shut
Is it late enough, Is it late enough?
Can I wake you up, can I wake you up?
Is it late?
Can I wake you up, can I wake you up?
Is it late, is it late, is it late enough?
There's a story in which my eyes shut
Can I wake you up, can I wake you up?
Is it late enough, is it late enough?
There's a story in which my eyes shut
Could you back me up, could you back me up?
Can I wake you up, can I wake you up?
Is it late enough, is it late enough?
There's a story in which my eyes shut
Could you back me up, could you back me up?
Saw you hang back
With your eyes looking down
And it's all wasted now.
Told you but you can't take it.
Can I wake you up, can I wake you up?
Is it late enough, is it late enough?
There's a story in which my eyes shut
Could you back me up
