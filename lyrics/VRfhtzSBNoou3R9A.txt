When you need to smile
But you can't afford it
Go on point it out
I'm gonna steal it
When the floor is more familiar than the ceiling
I will break in late at night
Shake up how you're feeling

I'll never stop
Breaking the law for you
I'll never stop
Helping to pull you through
Whatever it takes to get what you need
Ignore the alarms
Ignore the police
I'll never stop

Breaking the law for you

When you're taking steps
But you need to go faster
We can speed through streets
So the shadows can't catch up
When the corridors and all the stairs are making you tired

I will come for you
Set the building on fire

I'll never stop
Breaking the law for you
I'll never stop
Helping to pull you through
Whatever it takes to get what you need
Ignore the alarms

Ignore the police
I'll never stop
Breaking the law for you

I'll never stop
Breaking the law for you
I'll never stop
Helping to pull you through
Whatever it takes to get what you need
Ignore the alarms
Ignore the police
I'll never stop
Breaking the law for you
