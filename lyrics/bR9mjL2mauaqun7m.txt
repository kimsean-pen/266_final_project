I've never had a girl that ever meant so much to me
The way you kiss me, the way you squeeze me, the way you touch me
You know I love you, you know I need you, I'm gonna let you know
I'm gonna hold you tight, and when we're makin' love, I'm gonna do it slow

Dance, dance with me
Life's a fantasy
Stand next to me
Like ecstasy

Dance, dance with me
Life's a fantasy
Stand next to me
Like ecstasy

So when you need me, just reach for me, call out my name
You know I got you, you know you think of me every time of day
Don't hesitate, I'm the type of man that'll stand right by,
What you took from me, is what I took like you, I'll stand by your side

Oh, baby baby

Dance, dance with me (Girl you know that)
Life's a fantasy (Come on over here and)
Stand next to me ('Cause baby your love's just)
Like ecstasy

Dance, dance with me (Girl you know that)
Life's a fantasy (Come on over here and)
Stand next to me ('Cause baby your love's just)
Like ecstasy

Dance, dance with me
Life's a fantasy
Stand next to me
Like ecstasy

Fantasy,
Next to me,
Fantasy,
Next to me,
Fantasy,
Next to me
