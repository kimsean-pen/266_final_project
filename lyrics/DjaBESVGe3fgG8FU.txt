Infatuated with the ignorance we all pretend to ignore
With the time and preparation, I could be a tyrant and ensure the downfall

No secrets kept within the walls

The darkest day of man is upon us all
Now the world can rest in peace forever
Now the world can rest in peace forever
Now the world can rest in peace forever
