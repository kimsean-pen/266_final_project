i broke the surface so i can breathe
i close my eyes so i can see
i tie my arms to be free
have you ever been free?

she's not breathing
she's not moving
she's not coming back

i burn a fire to stay cool
i burn myself, i am the fuel
i never meant to be cruel
have you ever been cruel?

she's not breathing
she's not moving
she's not coming back, back, back

shut the door
shut the door, so i can leave
shut the door
