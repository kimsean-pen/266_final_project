The mirror says, "Who are you, who are you?" Oh
Lookin' for a reason not to shoot
Please don't shoot, please don't shoot, oh
Fear is just a product of the truth
No escape, summer in vain
Throwback sixth grade, livin' in pain, yuh
All this rap sounds the same, yuh
Maybe I'll make the game change, yuh
Or maybe I'll stay so lame
Or maybe go Kurt Cobain
Or maybe I'll reach that fame
But hate to go out wit' a bang
So back to the man in the mirror
Where I am interferes with my plans next year
Want a grand, hunnid bands, couple racks, couple Xans
Couple big titty hentai goth girlfriends
Fuck all that shit 'til the world ends
I don't wanna make racks, I wanna make friends
I don't need cash, fuck a snakeskin
Fuck a snake kid, fake kid, fake friend
You a bitch, get treated like a bitch do
In a few months, I will forget you
In a few months, I'll take too much
Give my cash to the fam, yes, thank you
I've been sittin' on heat like a tank do
I've been blowin' up fast like my rage do
Talk shit, boy, I'll rearrange you
Got my hate in the front with grenades in the trunk
You ain't special just because you fuckin' say so
Actions speak loud like my Draco
I been dreamin', that Creme Soda Faygo
Never fall in love with another fake ho
Я ушелве запрос на вершине
Ничего не сказал, подсколзнул и упал
И вернул я тебя суперзвездой
И опять я кричал, в этот раз я остал
Who are you, who are you? Oh
Lookin' for a reason not to choose, oh
Please don't choose, please don't shoot, oh
Fear is just a product of the truth, oh
Who are you, who are you? Oh
Lookin' for a reason not to choose, oh
Please don't choose, please don't choose, oh
Don't fear, I won't choose you
Who are you, who are you? Oh
Lookin' for a reason not to shoot, oh
Please don't shoot, please don't shoot, oh
Fear is just a product of the truth, oh
