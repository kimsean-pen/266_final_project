Shinobi vs dragonninja
Got it all too high
got it figured out,
i wanna do whatever
laugh until september
and i seem to think that you are one to be with me
maybe i was wrong
u were moving on
and i sit and wonder
falling under
get my way or nothing will move on
everyone has gone
you feel so empty, but i've got me a friend
and i like it
and i know u say i can care for someone
but are you that clever that you smile forever?
if its something like here
coz i just don't feel it
baby its a treaty
maybe you are not her
and i sit and wonder, falling under
get my way or nothing will move on
everyone has gone.
you feel so empty, but i've got me a friend
and i like it, ooooooh!
say now, got it for all of me
answer why
laugh untill september, and i seem to think that you were once here with me
