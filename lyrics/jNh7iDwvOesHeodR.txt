In the pursuit of health, wealth & peace
Try not to dwell in the rear view on momentary street.
Shun substance for distraction.
You can't squeeze love from hateful action.
Picking up the pieces from the days when
youth was my religion & friends were gods.
Awoke and aged atheist in a cold sweat
Begging for recompense.

Accepting myself, accepting my condition.
Avoiding attachment & following my vision.
The changes I waited for never came.
My struggles of yesterday are my struggles of today.

Give me your heart again, I'll give you mine.
And maybe again, maybe in time...
Our spirits burning bonfire bright in the inky night.
