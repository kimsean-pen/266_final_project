This won't break your heart but I just think it could
'Cause I haven't tried as hard as I should
To separate you from everything I do
But I would never wanna come between us two

I'll keep your memory vague, so you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me
I'll keep your memory vague so you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me

And now I'm thinking back to what I said before
I hope your heart won't have to hurt anymore
'Cause it's really not that sad from here
Because the moments I can feel you near
They keep you close to me my dear
And if they ever become too clear

I'll keep your memory vague so you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me
I'll keep your memory vague so you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me

Now you're gone away, don't worry it's okay
That you're gone away
Now you're gone away further than yesterday
But you're never leaving since my mind replays

I'll keep your memory vague so you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me
I'll keep your memory vague so you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me
I'll keep your memory vague so you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me
I'll keep your memory vague so you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me
