Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

Look the real me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices they running out of options
Cause I've been going off and they don't know when it's stopping
And we came to the top and I see that you've been learning
And when I take you shopping you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it
