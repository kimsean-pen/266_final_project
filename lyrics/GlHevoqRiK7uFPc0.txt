Well, you call me your baby
When you're holding my hand
But the way that you hurt me
I just don't understand

Well, you say that you need me
Like the ocean needs sand
But they way you mistreat me
I just don't understand

Well, you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand

Well, you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand

Well, you call me your baby
And you're holding my hand
Oh, honey, you hurt me
And you don't understand

You just don't understand
You just don't understand
You just don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
