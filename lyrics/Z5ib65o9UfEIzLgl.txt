She want to move to California
She must've fucking lost her mind
She want to move to California
It's hard to get through every time

She make a movie with her friends
Put it up in a minute
Everybody say it now, ain't no loop at the minute
Everybody saying "How, how you do it, you did it?"
I'ma show you what it done but, enough for a finish
Pay attention, you listen
You keep losing your mind
How you want to loop this shit but looking like a Vine?

But they don't pay for no privilege
Now she broke in Koreatown
In the condo you rented
But they get your percentage

In California, ooh
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah
He want to move to California
He want to hang with DC Fly

All the people all around and the follower people
I go watching a "ha ha" make a girlfriend giggle
Make her feel so official, make it Serena Vista
Supernova, new residual, making money a little
Make the smoker illegal
Make the living illegal
Make the laughing illegal
Make it snap for a people
When you make a movie now
Know you making no difference
It's a tickle on the mind before you finish the sentence
So, go pimp a like on Vine but don't pay for the privilege

Now you broke in Koreatown, in the condo you rented
But they get your percentage
Oh, you broke in Koreatown in that condo you rented
But they get your percentage

In California
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah
He want to move to California
He want to hang with DC Fly
