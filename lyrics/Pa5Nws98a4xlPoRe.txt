Would you lay with me in a field of stone
If my needs were strong would you lay with me
Should my lips grow dry would you wet them dear
In the midnight hour if my lips were dry

Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
Wipe the blood away from my dieing hand
If I give my self to you

Would you bathe me with me in the stream of life
When the moon is full would you bathe with me

Will you still love me when I'm down and out
In my time of trials will you stand by me

Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
Wipe the blood away from my dieing hand
If I give my self to you

Would you lay with me in a field of stone
If my lips grew dry would you wet them dear
Would you bathe with me in the stream of life
Would you still love me when I'm down and out

Would you lay with me in a field of stone
When the moon is full will you lay with me
