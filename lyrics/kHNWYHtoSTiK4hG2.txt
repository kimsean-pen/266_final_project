My girl's ready to take control
She just blows my mind
She only listens to the radio
To see who's alive... yeah

She wakes up scared of getting old, she don't feel no shame
She knows so many pretty boys and they are all the same
They said hey there girl, tell me whad'ya do
She said nothing but I'm damn sure it's more than you

That girl's a genius, wha- oh- oh- oh- ohh
I think she's serious, wha- oh- oh- oh- oh- ohh

If what you know is who you are, then she's everything
You don't need an education to know the class that you're in
They said hey there girl, tell me whad'ya do
She said nothing but I'm damn sure it's more than you

That girl's a genius, wha- oh- oh- oh- ohh
I think she's serious, wha- oh- oh- oh- ohh
That girl's a genius, wha- oh- oh- oh- ohh
I think she's serious, wha- oh- oh- oh- oh- ohh

She said hey there boy, come on over and sit
Love is when you wanna kiss and you get bit

That girl's a genius, wha- oh- oh- oh- ohh
I think she's serious, wha- oh- oh- oh- ohh
That girl's a genius, wha- oh- oh- oh- ohh
I think she's serious, wha- oh- oh- oh- ohh

That girl's a genius
That girl's a genius
That girl's a genius, wha- oh- oh- oh- oh- ohh
