They fired off the first shot
So we're on our feet and running
We're re-writing all the text books
In the process of becoming
We've so much to live for
If we stop putting up a fight
There's a place for every story
And this one starts with us tonight

Let me take you down
To Café Europa
There's so much to be found
So much to discover
Let me take you down
To Café Europa
There's so much to be found

I won't let you down

We're travelling by moonlight
From London to the Highlands
We lose ourselves in inner cities
In the hope of re-defining
The space that surrounds us
Or the emptiness within
It's all in the papers
The boy's in love again

Always arriving
Headlights lit up from coast to coast
Empty days, full to bursting
With the names of the people and places we miss the most

I'm taking the last train
Flying the last flight
Calling on the angels
They're letting in the sunlight

Let me take you down
To Café Europa
There's so much to be found

I won't let you down

It's the heart that has been broken
Finds the truth in what is spoken
