I've been on a long road
With the devil right beside me
Rising with the morning sun
It's a hunger that drives me

Oh, long
Set my Soul
Take my pain
And turn it into gold
'Cause all I know, all I know, all I know is

Champion, I can take a beating, ah
Rise again, we're into the jungle, until the end
I can live forever, I'll rise again
Keep rising up, I'll
Champion, I can take a beating, I'll
Rise again, we're into the jungle, until the end
I can live forever, I'll rise again
Keep rising up, ah

Every time when I'm down
Is the struggle that reminds me
So even gon' fill me now
Put the wings upon my feet

Oh, long
Set my Soul
Take my pain
And turn it into gold
'Cause all I know, all I know, all I know is

Champion, I can take a beating, I'll
Rise again, we're into the jungle, until the end
I can live forever, I'll rise again
Keep rising up, ah
Champion, I can take a beating, I'll
Rise again, we're into the jungle, until the end
I can live forever, I'll rise again
Keep rising up, ah

Rise up, rise up, hm
Rise up, rise up, hm
Rise up, rise up, hm
Rise up, rise up, hm
Rise up, rise up, hm

Champion, I can take a beating, I'll
Rise again, we're into the jungle, until the end
I can live forever, I'll rise again
Keep rising up, ah
Champion, I can take a beating, I'll
Rise again, we're into the jungle, until the end
I can live forever, I'll rise again
Keep rising up, ah
