Black wave coming will it hit
I can taste the fear yeah it's written on my lips
Sipping on a cold one waiting for the rinse
Woke up with an omen tatted on my wrist
Black wave coming will it drop
I can see the fear yeah it's written on the wall
Who you gonna trust when the killer is the cop
Fire in my bloodstream, water in my lungs

Waiting on a black wave
Running in a rat maze
Shaking in my own cage
What do I believe? I believe
Waiting on a black wave
Living under bad days
Shaking in my own cage
What do I believe
Stumbling down the street I swear to god you don't wanna test me

Black wave blocking out the sun
Baby when you go down ain't no coming up
Thought that you were safe but nobody ever was
Choking on a diamond, poison in your lungs
At the end guess we're all just animals
At the end is it all just greed
When the ocean crash down who you gonna call
Hold your breath, hold your breath, counting 1 2

Waiting on a black wave
Running in a rat maze
Shaking in my own cage
What do I believe? I believe
Waiting on a black wave
Living under bad days
Shaking in my own cage
What do I believe
Stumbling down the street I swear to god you don't wanna test me

How did a girl like me
End up in a world so mean
