I don't really care about what they say
I'm a come back like a boomerang
Won't let the haters get their way
I'm a come back like a boomerang
Ooh ooh whoa ah
Ooh ooh whoa ah
Ooh ooh whoa ah
I'm a come back like a boomerang
Ooh ooh whoa ah
Ooh ooh whoa ah
Ooh ooh whoa ah
I'm a I'm a come back

They can keep talking their talk
But I'm a keep walking my walk
And I won't hear a sou-ound

Yeah they're just trying to see
If they can get the best of me
Well not this time aro-ound

Stuck to the phone
Like they're all alone
Hide behind the screen
Cause they're just so mean
But we don't play it like that
We don't even fight back

All of their words
We just brush it off
Saying we're fake
Yeah
No we're not
Trying to throw us off track
But we know how to come back

I don't really care about what they say
I'm a come back like a boomerang
Won't let the haters get their way (hey hey hey hey!)
I'm a come back like a boomerang
Ooh ooh whoa ah
Ooh ooh whoa ah
Ooh ooh whoa ah
I'm a come back like a boomerang (hey hey hey!)
Ooh ooh whoa ah
Ooh ooh whoa ah
Ooh ooh whoa ah
I'm a I'm a come back

Try to try to make me stop
But I'm a climbing to the top
Just look how far I've go-one

Bigger, better, faster, stronger
Yeah see I ain't just a talker
Catch me if you can (hey)
Catch us if you can (HEY!)

Stuck to the phone
Like they're all alone
Hide behind the screen
Cause they're just so mean
But we don't play it like that (what?)
We don't even fight back (uh-huh)

All of their words
We just brush it off
Saying we're fake yeah,
No we're not
Trying to throw us off track
But we know how to come back
(Hey you!)

I don't really care about what they say
I'm a come back like a boomerang (hey hey!)
Won't let the haters get their way
I'm a come back back back like (I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm a)
Try try to throw us off track (hey hey hey!) (I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm a) (hey hey hey!)
We know how to come back
Ooh whoa
I don't really care about what they say
I'm a come back like a boomerang
Won't let the haters get their way (way...)
I'm a come back like a boomerang

I'm a come back I'm a I'm a come back

Bigger better faster stronger
Yeah see I ain't just a talker
