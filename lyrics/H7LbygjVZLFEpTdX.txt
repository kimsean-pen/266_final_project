Caught up in a whirlwind can't catch my breath
Knee deep in hot water, broke out in a cold sweat
Can't catch a turtle in this rat race
Feels like I'm losin' time at a breakneck pace

Afraid of my own shadow in the face of grace
Heart full of darkness spotlight on my face
There was love all around me but I was lookin' for revenge
Thank God it never found me would have been the end

Walkin' the tightrope, steppin' on my friends
Walkin' the tightrope, it was a shame and a sin
Walkin' the tightrope between wrong and right
Walkin' the tightrope both day and night

Lookin' back in front of me, the mirror's a grin
Through eyes of love I see I'm really lookin' at a friend
We've all had our problems, that's the way life is
My heart goes out to others, who are there to make amends?

We've been walkin' the tightrope tryin' to make it right
Walkin' the tightrope, every day and every night
Walkin' the tightrope, bring it all around
Walkin' the tightrope from the lost to found

Walkin' the tightrope, stretched around the world
Walkin' the tightrope, save the boys and girls
Walkin' the tightrope, let's make it right
Walkin' the tightrope, do it, do it tonight
Walkin' the tightrope
