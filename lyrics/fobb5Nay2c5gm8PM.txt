I've got this feeling that there's something that I missed
(I could do most anything to you)
Don't you breathe, don't you breathe
(I could do most anything to you)
Something happened that I never understood
(I could do most anything to you)
You can't leave, you can't leave

Every second dripping off my finger tips
(I could do most anything to you)
Wage your war, wage your war
(I could do most anything to you)
Another soldier says he's not afraid to die
(I could do most anything to you)
I am scared, I'm so scared

In slow motion the blast is beautiful
(I could do most anything to you)
Doors slam shut, doors slam shut
(I could do most anything to you)
A clock is ticking but it's hidden far away
(I could do most anything to you)
Safe and sound, safe and sound

(I could do most anything to you)
(I could do most anything to you)
(I could do most anything to you)
(I could do most anything to you)
(I could do most anything to you)
(I could do most anything to you)
