Sometimes I am missing a word from my friends,
Why can't we share the problems hand in hand?
And when I ask the mirror what is the truth?

All the funny things you do!
Look into my eyes
Do you really mean it?
'Cause this is no question
You have to face the facts in time and
Don't forget you're high
Wouldn't you rather check what's your confession?

Green bubbles came out of the crystal thing
A sudden cry of an old rain-coated guy
And softly grey gnomes were whispering to my ear:

All the funny things you do!

Just an advice: Don't ask your face tonight
Don't tell the words you like so much
Don't tell, just act in spite
Don't try to prove your own brains might
Don't lose the sun, 'cause you need fun

Two races keep me in action
Don't bother about my reaction
I had to learn a lot from my master
All I say is try to get the green-bubble-raincoated main

Green bubble raincoated man
Don't stay in the rain again
Drink this poisoned cup of tea
Wait and wonder what you'll see
Gimme back my crystal mirror
And you gonna be a hero
Green bubble raincoated man
Don't stay in the rain.
