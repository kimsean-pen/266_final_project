What's worse than the comedown
From high high high up
What's worse than the runaround
I can't hide my disappointment

I need a kiss
Or maybe a little bit of bliss

Bliss me up
Till I can say it's not so bad in my brain
Bliss me up
Till I can say it's not so bad in my brain

I'm caught in the undertow
But won't cry cry cry out
So scared but don't want to go
I know I'll be fine without you

Just one more kiss
Or maybe a little bit of bliss

Bliss me up
Till I can say it's not so bad in my brain
Bliss me up
Till I can say it's not so bad in my brain

My tears are a river of me
And I'm no longer afraid
I see that God is a woman
It's not so bad in my brain

I don't have to always do as you say
Do as you say
Do as you
I don't have to always do as you say
Do as you say
Do as you
I don't have to always do as you say
Do as you say
Do as you say

My tears are a river of me
And I'm no longer afraid
I see that God is a woman
It's not so bad in my brain
