Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping, no longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive?

Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Becoming one with our ritual

Singing songs of the old days
Try to remember what's gone by
Stronger in new ways, don't care what they say
This is your life, it's time to rejoice

Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Becoming one with our ritual

Our destiny is what we learned
Together wanting something more
Their misery and demons burn
A feeling that's worth fighting for

Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Becoming one with our ritual
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Becoming one with our ritual
Becoming one with our ritual
