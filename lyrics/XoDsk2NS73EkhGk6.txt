The phone vibrated twice, I looked but I still didn't read it
Cause I knew that it was gonna stress me out and right now I don't need it
She told me she was leaving, I gave her too many reasons
She told me that I don't care, but I told her I'm no good with my feelings
When I first met her, I'm not gonna lie
I was struggling sleeping
Then she got a nigga dreaming, and then helped me achieving
Alright fuck it let's read it, she said the roads won't love you like I will and I'm starting to believe it
In fact I'm starting to feel it
Back then I was driving with no license, I was struggling with violence, the man said 12 pounds for 2 tickets, then there was an awkward silence
She had to pay me into the cinema, and at that point I was frightened, do I tell her that I fell off, or do I lie?
Either way she was smiling
I told that I'm gonna be somebody, must have been hard to believe, when I'm sat there bagging up weed, breaking down 28 G's
And that was in Bury New Road, bedroom stinking cheese, but she was on a ride or die ting, we're like Beauty and the Beast

I'm not home much no more, she sits and cries about the times we were low
And when her family ask about me she says we're cool
Tell her not to cry no more cause I'm coming home, I'm coming home

I'm not home much no more, she sits and cries about the times we were low
And when her family ask about me she says we're cool
Tell her not to cry no more cause I'm coming home, I'm coming home

She told me that I'm the man, and I gotta spread my wings
And now that you're smashing music, you could have plenty of tings
And your getting better with the spotlight, then she looked down and grinned
I could see the tears and I pray to god that he forgive my sins
I remember the night, when the police knocked on, and she was shaking on the bed
And I was tryna' hide the weed, shaking my head
And then I threw it in the bag, and I ran across the park, she met me on the other side, and we was rolling in the dark
And that's that criminal love, she's wearing leggings and Nike's
I'm wearing bali and gloves, no one's fucking with us
And now I'm fucking her up, I told her no sidechick could ever break down what we've build up, then I see her eyes fill up
Tell her I'm coming home, I'm sick of this black patrone
I'm sick of these dizzy girls, I'm sick of us acting cold
Tell her when I get back, I'm gonna do this properly
No more setbacks, nobody can stop me

I'm not home much no more, she sits and cries about the times we were low
And when her family ask about me she says we're cool
Tell her not to cry no more cause I'm coming home, I'm coming home

I'm not home much no more, she sits and cries about the times we were low
And when her family ask about me she says we're cool
Tell her not to cry no more cause I'm coming home, I'm coming home
