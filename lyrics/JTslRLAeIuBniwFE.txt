I was made out of nothing
You were made out of gold
From golden I think I'm something
But together we know
Won't you lie with me, lie with me

I was made out to look back
Like I didn't belong
And you were made up to keep up
Where I have come from
Won't you lie with me, lie with me

Sail away, we are the lucky ones
Sail away, together we could run
Into the deep, for all to see
Won't you sail away, where we can't be
If you lie with me, lie with me

We were made to discover
We've got nothing to lose
This is for one another
I've got nothing to prove
Won't you lie with me, lie with me

Sail away, we are the lucky ones
Sail away, together we could run
Into the deep, for all to see
Won't you sail away, where we can't be
If you lie with me, lie with me

I was made out of nothing
You were made out of gold
From golden I think I'm something
But together we know
Won't you lie with me, lie with me

Sail away, we are the lucky ones
Sail away, together we could run
Into the deep, for all to see
Won't you sail away, where we can't be
If you lie with me, lie with me

Sail away, we are the lucky ones
Sail away, together we could run
Into the deep, for all to see
Won't you sail away, where we can't be
Won't you lie with me, lie with me
Oh come on lie with me, lie with me
