Hello, hello it's me again
You're still not home
'Cause if you were, it's after four a.m.
I wouldn't be here alone, see

God, give me the strength
And the courage I need
What my heart lives for
Have to let it be

But it's okay, I understand
(You've got to leave)
I don't cry no more, baby, what for?
(You don't shed a tear for me)
See, I was blind but now I see

There's gotta be a better man for me
There's gotta be a better man for me

Hello, oh, no, not this again
I'll be counting down
Your bags are packed and they're at the door
I gotta get used to not having you around

God, give me the strength
And the courage I need
To move forward with my life
Have to let him be

But it's okay, I understand
(You've got to leave)
I don't cry no more, baby, what for?
(You don't shed a tear for me)
See, I was blind but now I see

There's gotta be a better man for me
There's gotta be a better man for me

Ooh, God, hear me now
'Cause, God, give me the strength
And the courage I need
'Cause I know now, baby
There's gotta be a better man for me

You've got to leave
You don't shed a tear for me
See, I was blind, but now I see

There's gotta be a better man for me
There's gotta be a better man for me

See I'm tired of your lying and I'm tired of tryin'
(You've got to leave)
I don't cry no more, baby, what for?
(You don't shed a tear for me)
See, I was blind but now I see
(There's gotta be a better man for me)

Somewhere out there, baby
(There's gotta be a better man for me)
There's gotta be a better man, oh, baby
Now I see, there's gotta be somebody for me
