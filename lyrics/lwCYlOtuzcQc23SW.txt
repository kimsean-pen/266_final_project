Sing, sing at the top at your voice
Love without fear in your heart
Yeah and feel, feel like you still have a choice
If we all light up we can scare away the dark

We wish our weekdays away
Spend our weekends in bed
Drink ourselves stupid
And work ourselves dead
Or just because that's what mom and dad said we should do

We should run though the forest
We should swim in the sea
We should laugh, we should cry
we should love, we should dream
We should stare at the stars and not just at screens
You should hear what I'm saying and know what it means

To sing sing at the top at your voice
Love without fear in your heart
Yeah and feel, feel like you still have a choice
If we all light up we can scare away the dark

Yeah we wish we were happier, thinner and fitter
We wish we weren't losers and liars and quitters
We want something more, not just nasty and bitter
We want something real, not just hashtags and Twitter
It's the meaning of life and it's streamed live on YouTube
But I guess gangnam style will still get more views
We're scared of drowning, flying and shooters
But were all slowing dying in front of fucking computers

So, sing at the top at your voice
Love without fear in your heart
Can you feel, feel like you still have a choice
When we all light up we can scare away the dark
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh no

Sing loud now
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh no

Sing loud now
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh no

Sing loud now
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh no

Sing, sing at the top of your voice
Love without fear in your heart
Feel, feel like you still have a choice
If we all light up we can scare away the dark
