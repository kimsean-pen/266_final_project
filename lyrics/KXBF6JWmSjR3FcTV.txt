I will never let you go
I know you want it, know you want it.
Learning love means not to know.
I'll learn to take it, learn to take your love.

I will never leave your fears
I know you're lost now, know you're lost now.
Counting days won't buy us years
We'll star it over, start it over, love

I'll never let the magic go.
I'll float away into your afterglow
I'll never let you go.
I'll melt away into your afterglow.

The sky will melt in tears.
I'll float away into your afterglow.
The sky will melt in tears.
I'll melt away into your afterglow.

People never smile to say goodbye.
Leaving means there's nothing left to try.
But I broke my wings for you.
I smiled as you untied our love for good.

The sky will melt in tears.
I'll float away into your afterglow.
The sky will melt in tears.
I'll melt away into your afterglow.

(Love)

The sky will melt in tears.
I'll melt away into your afterglow.
The sky will melt in tears.
I'll float away into your afterglow.
