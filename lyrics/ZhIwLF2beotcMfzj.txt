Your face, my face
You breathe, I breathe
You fail, I fake
I pray, I pray...

You lose, I lose,
You bruise, I bruise
I hunt, you stay
My prey, My prey

My Masquerade
If you're not afraid
To take a step into my world

A ball, tonight
Cover your eyes
By touch and taste
We'll find our way

Your secrets deep
Yes I will keep
I hunt, you stay
My prey, my prey

My Masquerade
If you're not afraid
To take a step into my world

Take of your mask
And you will see
The freak in you
The freak in me
Tonight we hide
From judging eyes
We'll dance until the sunrise
