I see guys at night drinking in bars
Talking to girls and driving cars
They heard about this place from a magazine
One of their best friends has been
They all laugh and joke like there's nothing wrong
Like they are right where they belong

She met a guy, they went on a date
She liked him, but it was getting late
He called again, but she let it ring
She needs a little more time to think
She reads the paper on the train
A guy stares the entire way

He got a job right out of school
His place is small, but it has a pool
It's just a couple of stops away
He feels a sadness that he can't explain
It's hard for him to have fun
His mother died when he was young

Yesterday I had a life (I had a life)
I had a home (I had a home)
I wore a smile (I wore a smile)
To sell my soul (to sell my soul)
My tie was blue (my tie was blue)
And my shirt was white (my shirt was white)
So why can't I figure out
How to feel alright?
I know this could be mine again
If you would just tell me what I need to change

I've seen enough (I've seen enough)
I'll never go back (I'll never go back)
I'll never get my life (get my life)
Back on track (back on track)
They all say so much (say so much)
But say nothing at all (nothing at all)
The world is so big and I feel so fucking small

And then I think to myself and sigh
How can you really give up
When you never tried?

One day I called in sick, but I was right outside
I just sat down on a bench and cried
I saw this child playing in the street
His whole life right there under his feet
I knew that what you do, that's all there is
But then I went upstairs and sat down at my desk

I don't fit in, but I don't feel bad
You can't miss a feeling that you never had
I know it's a sham, but it seemed so real
And what I had to be, isn't who I am
You see
The man I see (man I see)
He would never dream (never dream)
I just took the life (took the life)
They handed me (handed me)
I remember this like it was (like it was)
Yesterday (yesterday)
Even though it now seems (now it seems)
So far away (far away)
I've learned much more than he'll ever know
So what do we do now, and where do we go?
