I've always been young at heart
Right from the very start
Dreaming of where wild things are
And hitching my wagon to stars

I'm pinching my hands 'til I'm sure that I'm still alive
Watching the sand slip through my fingers, I've been
Abandoning safe bets for fleeting highs
Hoping the ocean won't take what's materialized too soon...

I've always been an old soul
Empty has always been full
Lost is my own kind of found
And silence, my favorite sound

I'm pinching my hands 'til I'm sure that I'm still alive
Watching the sand slip through my fingers, I've been
Abandoning safe bets for fleeting highs
Hoping the ocean won't take what's materialized too soon...
