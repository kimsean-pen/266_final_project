So let me be your light
There's a truth we can't deny
Somehow this time
You won't deny it

What got lost inside
I have found it now
There's a reason why

I will love you endlessly
And even if I cry
I'll be there by your side
For a lifetime
I will love you endlessly
And even when we die
You'll be there, by my side
Endlessly

So come let me be your life
After all these sleepless nights
Somehow I know
My strength will guide you

Through the darkest times
Now that I have found
All the reasons why

I will love you endlessly
And even if I cry
I'll be there by your side
For a lifetime
I will love you endlessly
And even when we die
You'll be there, by my side
Endlessly

You know me well
Somehow I'm under your spell
I want you to see me
I'll share every moment with you

I will love you endlessly
And even if I cry
I'll be there by your side
For a lifetime
I will love you endlessly
And even when we die
You'll be there, by my side
Endlessly
