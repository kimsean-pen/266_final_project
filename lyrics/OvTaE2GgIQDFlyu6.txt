You'll really want to grow and grow till tall
They all, in the end, will fall

You'll know, when's time to go on
You'll really want to grow and grow till tall
They all, in the end, will fall

You'll know, when's time to go on

They all, in the end, will fall

Grow till tall, they all, in the end, will fall
They, in the end, will turn and fall

You'll know, you'll go
You'll know, you'll know
You'll know, you'll know
