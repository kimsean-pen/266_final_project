Scarred, your back was turned
Curled like an embryo
Take another face
You will be kissed again

I was cold as I mouthed the words
And crawled across the mirror
I wait, await the next breath
Your name like ice into my heart

A shallow grave
A monument to the ruined age
Ice in my eyes
And eyes like ice don't move

Screaming at the moon
Another past time
Your name like ice
Into my heart

Everything as cold as life
Can no one save you?
Everything as cold as silence
And you never say a word

Your name like ice
Into my heart
Your name like ice
Into my heart
