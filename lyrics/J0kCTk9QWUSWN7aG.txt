I wonder how a gap can feel this much
How a gap can feel like something this big
How it multiplies in my veins
And in my blood and home
And trigger itself in my thoughts

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I wonder how a gap can feel this much
How a gap can feel like something this big
How it multiplies in my veins
And in my blood and home
And trigger itself in my thoughts

I'd like to be your
Beautiful hell
Your beautiful hell
I'd like to be your
Beautiful hell
Your beautiful hell

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
