Happiness was just outside my window
I thought it'd crash blowing 80-miles an hour
But, happiness is a little more like knocking
On your door, you just let it in

Happiness feels a lot like sorrow
Let it be, you can't make it come or go
But you are gone, not for good but for now
And gone for now feels a lot like gone for good

Happiness is a firecracker sitting on my headboard
Happiness was never mine to hold
Careful child, light the fuse and get away
'Cause happiness throws a shower of sparks

Happiness damn near destroys you
Breaks your faith to pieces on the floor
So you tell yourself that's enough for now
But happiness has a violent roar

Happiness it's like the old man told me
Look for it, and you'll never find it all
But let it go, live your life and leave it
Then one day, wake up and she'll be home
Home, home, home

She'll be
She'll be
She'll be home
She'll be home
She'll be home
She'll be home
She'll be home
She'll be home
She'll be home
She'll be home
She'll be
