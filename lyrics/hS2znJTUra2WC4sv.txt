Burn - Tove Styrke
How do you know that we're indie
Now I can see clear, the tricks are cheap
Baby, it's scum and for no fun
How do you know you're a fine one
Your mind is stuck up when she raised her song
But now he's gunning for a new friend
Baby is gunning for a new friend
Betta run out like you mean it
Oh, no, can you feel it
Now everything's broke is a beating
Teared by bright eyes
And now, baby, no, there's no turning back
Everything's wrong and it won't come back
Baby, you're right when you feel it
Burn it up, break it up
Burn it up Burn it up, break it up
Burn it up Burn it up, break it up
Honey, you sure where yo heart stays
Sits alone to never have the last say
Big boy gunning for a new friend
How do you know where you want to
The smell of city haze and salt in you
And 'cuz with you like a no front
Big boy gunning for a new friend
Betta run out like you mean it
Oh, no, can you feel it
Now everything's broke is a beating
Teared by bright eyes
And now, baby, no, there's no turning back
Everything's wrong and it won't come back
Baby, you're right when you feel it
Burn it up, break it up
Burn it up
Betta run out like you mean it
Oh, no, can you feel it
Now everything's broke is a beating
Teared by bright eyes
And now, baby, no, there's no turning back
Everything's wrong and it won't come back
Baby, you're right when you feel it
Burn it up, break it up
Burn it up Burn it up, break it up
Burn it up Burn it up, break it up
