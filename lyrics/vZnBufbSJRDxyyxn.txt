Dear my love
Haven't you wanted to be with me
And dear my love
Haven't you long to be free
I can't keep

Pretending that I don't, even know you
And At sweet night
You are my own
Take my hand
We're leaving here tonight
There's no need to tell anyone

They'd only hold us down
So by the morning's light
We'll be half way to anywhere
Where love is more than just your name
I have dreamt

Of a place for you and I
No one knows
Who we are there
All I want
Is to give my life only to you
I've dream so long

I cannot dream anymore
Let's run away
I'll take you there
We're leaving here tonight
There's no need to tell anyone
They'd only hold us down
So by the morning's light
We'll be half way to anywhere
Where no one needs a reason
Forget this life come with me
Don't look back you're safe now
Unlock your heart drop your guard

No one's left to stop you
Forget this life come with me
Don't look back you're safe now
Unlock your heart drop your guard
No one's left to stop you now
We're leaving here tonight
There's no need to tell anyone
They'd only hold us down
So by the morning's light
We'll be half way to anywhere
Where love is more than just your name
