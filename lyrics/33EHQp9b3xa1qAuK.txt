A perfect example is all the things it's done to me
I think I'll lose my mind but not my memory
A perfect example is the things it's done to me

I think I might lose my mind
I think I might lose my mind
You think you might lose your mind
But not the memory, means a lot to me

A perfect example is all the things it's done to me
I think I might lose my mind but not my memory
A perfect example is what we all wish we could be

I think I might lose my mind
I think I might lose my mind
You think you might lose your mind
But not the memory, means a lot to me

A perfect example is, a perfect example is
A perfect example is, a perfect example is
A perfect example is, perfect
