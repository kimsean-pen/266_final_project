A code embedded deep within
Encrypted in vaults of bone and skin
A tug magnetic toward the dark
The wolf voracious hath witnessed it's mark

Internal pressure growing
Behind your eyes its mounting still
Constant thought of evil
Are coming to a head inside you?
Humanity decreasing
Blood is strong upon the passing winds
To forsake would be a sin
Let the night entrance you

You'll feel the pull of the moonlight equilibrium
Pitch black transmission of the soul
Instincts from within rise
We're all but beasts
That hunger from inside
Cannot escape this longing

These symptoms don't remit
For death, becoming sick
The long hairs feel them stand
The nightworld calls again
Your existence turning black
There'll be no coming back
A desire to teare and hack its growing
Lord please help us

You'll feel the pull of the moonlight equilibrium
Pitch black transmission of the soul
Instincts from within rise
We're all but beasts
That hunger from inside
You must subdue this yearning, to feast

That very eve the devil cameth
And his will did force thine idle hands
Open this heart of molten darkness
Floweth forth foul riviers of the damned

Blood of the lycan within thee enthroned
Heir to the cosmic fathers unknown
Who traileth not far from where death would increase
Seek they to murder to rid the world clean
A curse by the ancients of bloodline befouled
The clouds they are parting the moon has come out

Internal pressure growing
Behind your eyes its mounting still
Constant thought of evil
Are coming to a head inside you?
Humanity decreasing
Blood is strong upon the passing winds
To forsake would be a sin
Let the night entrance you

You'll feel the pull of the moonlight equilibrium
Pitch black transmission of the soul
Instincts from within rise
We're all but beasts
That hunger from inside
Cannot repress these urges to kill
To taste the red your only will
There's no salvation
