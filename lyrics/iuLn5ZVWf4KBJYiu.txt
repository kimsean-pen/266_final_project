I will lay laid open, I will lay laid open
I do it cause I'm a family man
When I met her at a hard grave
A heat wave hand-shake way
But the Carmex stayed
Come back, do not answer the door
And we met up like a ski team
10 ft out
With a cane man's clout
With the beat in now
And the walls turned in
And your chest came out
Cause you weren't too scared
Not amounting to your mother or your father
It's the memory of future gets three
It's the passing into ashes that's the ground that you eat
And you'll know we'll need a minute to repair
So when you teach 'em better teach 'em to share
So when they're standing by the river, you won't have to say
"You panicked on me"
We met up at the High Line
Great park
Rose bark birch
And the two stich hurt
You had this Torn Pac T-
And some horrible knees
But still standing fast
You always puts your heart on your back
Well we rose up outta G league
In a Teepee gloss
Where your tea leaves boss?
Well, I got your back now
Not amounting to your mother or your father
It's the memory of future gets three
It's the passing into ashes that's the ground that you eat
And you'll know we'll need a minute to repair
So when you teach em better teach em to share
So when they're standing by the River, you won't have to say:
"You panicked on me"
Cause now I'm a devotee
I'm a devotee
I will lay laid open
I will lay laid open
I will lay laid open
I will lay laid open
