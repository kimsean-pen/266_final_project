Call me, call me, call me

What a beautiful time we had together
Now it's gettin' late and we must leave each other
Just remember the time we had and how right I tried to be
It's all in a day's work, call me

Losing your love, acting foolishly
And go on and take your time 'cause you're only losing me
Love is a long ways from here, tell you it's all in the way you feel
If your love is real come to me

Call me, call me, call me come back home

The best thing I can do is give you your love, oh babe
Let you go away feelin' free as a dove
If you find you're a long ways from home
And somebody's doing you wrong

Just call on me, baby
And come back home
Call me, call me, call me
Come back home

Things ain't going right, yeah
It's all in a day's work, call me
When you're mournin', call me
When you're feelin' sad

It's all in a day's work, come back
Call me, call me
