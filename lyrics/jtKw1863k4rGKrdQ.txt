Let's go

Everybody needs to start their own fire
Everybody needs a riot of their own
Everybody needs to be something that they are not
Everybody needs to go it alone

Because living so free is a tragedy
When you can't be what you want to be
Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't see what you need to see
Okay!

In all the time spent hanging on to anything
In all the time spent knowing that they're wrong
In all the time wasted, stolen back, innocent
You won't get a second more, so move it along

Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't be what you want to be
Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't see what you need to see (2x)

Wishing and hoping and thinking, it's you
Who's got this all under control
Never a minute has passed you all by
When they haven't invaded your soul

It's not something you can hold
It's not something you own
It's not something you can buy or steal
You've got it when you're alone

Being free is a tragedy
When you don't know yourself
Being free is a tragedy
When you don't who you are

Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't be what you want to be
Living so free is a tragedy
When you can't see what you need to see (2x)

Let's go! Hey, hey, hey
All right man
This is the story of your life, man
