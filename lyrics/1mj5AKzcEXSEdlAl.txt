Aphrodite is rising from the shell
A newly born to be seen
To expel from the paradise
To drink from her well
Aphrodite is falling into the hell of her sins
And the lust
For that spell of the forbidden
Nectar from her well

(Oh, Venus illegitima)
Born again...
(Oh, Venus illegitima)
...without shame
(Oh, Venus illegitima)
Child of sin...
(Oh, Venus illegitima)

...is my name.
