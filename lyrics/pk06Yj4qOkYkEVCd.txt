From my cousins who live there.
And I heard about the gold found,

In your room in Brenson hall, tonight.
You can tell in this light,
They're just all bricks painted white, tonight.
And you know in your bones,
This might never feel like home, tonight.

You keep saying to me "I'm alright."
You keep saying to me "I'm fine."
You keep saying to me "I'm alright"
But I can see it in your...
