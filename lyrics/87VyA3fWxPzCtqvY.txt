I'm thinking 'bout a Yamaha
I'm thinking 'bout a Yamaha
To get away from all the cameras
I'm over it, don't wanna fantasize

Fate is 'round the corner, right (fate is 'round the corner right)
It hit me right between the eyes (hit me right between the eyes)
It's funny when they switch and pick a side (no, no, noo)

Ain't nobody gotta go through what I'm going through, no
But it seems like they all know what I'm supposed to do so
Let switch bodies for a day
You could me be and I could be you
Juggle the pile of shit that's bound to come through
You can have it
Since it's automatic

Now, switch (switch)
Tell me how it feels (feels)
To be somebody else (else)

Now, switch (switch)
It wasn't what you thought it was (was)
Another story to tell

Well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well

Well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well

So, tell me lies, tell me lies, tell me lies
You and I, ride or die, you will not
Entertain these other bitches and I will not
Entertain these other niggas, you know that
If I give you my heart
Will you hold it?
Will you put it up safe or will you fold it?
If I find out you cheatin' man, just know that
I'mma kill you and that hoe, ain't no goin' back

That's what she told me, and how could I blame her?
A small town girl, now she all famous (switch)
Maybe it's my fault, nah
Ain't like I've been livin' in the dark, nah
I told you everything from the start
And you the one that had the change of heart
Girl, you can have it
After all the damage

Now, switch (switch)
Tell me how it feels (feels)
To be somebody else (else)

Now, switch (switch)
It wasn't what you thought it was (was)
Another story to tell

Well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well

Well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well

I'm thinking I should speed it up
To get away from all the media
I'm human, don't you think I had enough?
My women claiming that I switched on her
Only 'cause I hit a switch on her
She wasn't really good at keeping up
