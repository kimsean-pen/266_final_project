Through dark and light I fight to be,
so close,
shadows and lies mask you from me.
So close,
bath my skin the darkness within,
so close,
the war of our lives no one can win.
The missing piece I yearn to find,
so close,
please clear the anguish from my mind.
So close,
but when the truth of you comes clear,
so close,
I wish my life I'd never come near,
so close.
Through dark and light I fight to be,
so close,
shadows and lies mask you from me.
