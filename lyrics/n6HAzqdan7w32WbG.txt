I could forget your name
I could forget your face forever
I could forget about the smile you always faked
The one you thought I bought, but never
I could forget your lies
I could forget the height for always
I could forget how desperately you tried
Flattery will get you nowhere

I could forget how you had tried to get the best in me
You'll never forget that you never got me
You never got me

Real nice to know that you care
To leave me soaking wet
I'm so surprised you weren't dead
You make me want to forget
(Make me want to forget)

I could forget your pride
I could forget your wandering eyes
I could forget about the way you made me feel
You talked to me so condescending

I could forget how you had tried to get the best in me
You'll never forget that you never got me
You never got me

Real nice to know that you care
To leave me soaking wet
I'm so surprised you weren't dead
You make me want to forget

Real nice to know that you cared
To leave me soaking wet
I'm so surprised you weren't dead
You make me want forget

Never got me
Never

Real nice to know that you care
To leave me soaking wet
I'm so surprised you weren't dead
You make me want to forget

Real nice to know that you care
To leave me soaking wet
I'm so surprised you weren't dead
You make me want to forget

You make me
You make me
You make me want to forget
You make me

Fuck you
