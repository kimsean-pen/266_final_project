Looking at the night sky, Nebula
You're my God, my religion
Take me to Cobain, Nirvana
Into a new dimension
Yes I've been smoking, yes I am high
I'll never die if I ever die
Like I'll be a legend, make something out of my life

Rise above it all, inshallah
I shall shine like Tutankhamun
I live and die with the sun
But my time will come

What does it take?

Thinking of tomorrow, Futura
It's a dark, twisted fiction
If I can change it, Hallelujah
I dream of more affection
Yes I've been drinking, I'm in my zone
I need nobody, good on my own
Like I'll mount to something
Titanic, when I'm gone

Rise above it all, inshallah
I shall shine like Tutankhamun
I live and die with the sun
But my time will come

What does it take?

Oh, I'm small like an atom, atomic bomb
I got the power
Gotta crack the code
I swear I won't abuse it
Just let me use it

What does it take?

All praise the most
All praise the most high

What does it take?
