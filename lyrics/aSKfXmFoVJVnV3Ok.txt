To connect
And make sense of it all
Realize
Through the chaos within
We measure what is everything but real
On a crooked scale

Bend it to our will
Dreaming is a form
Bend it to our will
Dreaming is a form
Shape it in our image

Fill in the blanks
And open the gates
Descend upon
Those who trespass against us

Torn from the sheltering city of pain
As crooked as they come

Bend it to our will
Dreaming is a form
Bend it to our will
Dreaming is a form
Shape it in our image

One clear cut line
That separates it all

We try to find
To barely see beyond
We look until we see
What our truth now will be

Now
Bend it to our will
The dreaming is a form
Bend it to our will
Dreaming is a form
Shape it in our image
