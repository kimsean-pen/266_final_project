Your face on the crowd
You're talking too loud
But I can't hear you calling

Your head in the clouds
Whatever come down
But I can't see you crawling all around

Life of the clouds
The lost and the found
But you can't see me crying?
No fun around
And I'm about to freakout

I've been down, I've been down, I've been down, I've been down

Hey

Needles and pins
Nobody wins
If you freakout I'm all in??
A feeling kicking in from all around

With no one around
About to freakout
And I just keep on falling round and round

I've been down, I've been down, I've been down, I've been down

I get down, I get down, I get down, I get down
