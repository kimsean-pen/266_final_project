This is the last song I write for you.
This is the last night I think of you.
Your name is Victor Ching, what do you do?
I phoned you this morning you couldn't hear me, I sent you letter you couldn't receive.
It's my favorite game, but I have changed.
It's too late to say I miss you Victor Ching, and you are on your way to Stafford in UK.
I know it's too late to say I'm fond of you.
You've got a girl from Singapore who you didn't like before.
I love you when you no longer love me.
I need you when you no longer need me.
You wanted me, but you have changed already.
It's too late to say I miss you Victor Ching
