Two months behind on rent now
Smile broad and they forgive you
Slept through a staff meeting
No one expects any different from you

It's hard to form adult connections
When you sleep on turtle bedspreads
I can fake my way through a date
But I (can't hide how child I am)

Misplaced another invoice
Add another dude to avoid
Bad with days and shitty with times
Guess its Thai takeout valentines

It's hard to form adult connections
When you sleep on turtle bedspreads
I can fake my way through a date
But I (can't hide how child I am)

When you're just charming enough to survive
When the people you owe they like you and so you don't die
When all you've got in your pocket is handshakes and lies
You're allowed to sit down but trust it'll be a short ride
