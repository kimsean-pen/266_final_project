I've been watchin' you from afar
For as long as I can remember
You are all a real man can need
And ever ask for, this is love
This is more than a crush (yeh)

It was Harlem at the Rukus
I saw you with your man, a smiling, huh
A coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment and that was that
So I skated off as you strolled off
Looking at your legs, god damn, they look so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission
If his love is real he's got to handle competition
You only knew him for five months (that's right)
Besides he drinks too much, and smokes too many blunts
And I'll be working out everyday thinkin' about you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catching flashbacks of our eye contact
Wish I could lay you on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold you in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years

Hey lover (hey lover hey lover)
This is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush, lover
Hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush

I see you at the bus stop waiting every day
Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way
And I don't want to violate your relationship
So I'll lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tongue'n you down with uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searching you body with my tongue girl all night
I wonder one day could it be (I wonder)
Simple dreams could turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny
Would your man get his hustle on, got your type scared
Break your off a little chump change to do your hair
It seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you follow our lead

Hey lover (hey lover hey lover)
This is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush, lover
Hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush

Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standing at the pay phone about to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Telling you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about traveling the distant lands
Escaping all the madness out here in the world
Becoming my wife no longer my girl
Then you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparalleled
Into an ocean of love we both fell
Swimming in the timeless currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss
Undying passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control
But, it's a fantasy, you won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swears he love you
So, I'm gonna keep all these feelings aside (that's right)
Keep my dreams alive until the right time
