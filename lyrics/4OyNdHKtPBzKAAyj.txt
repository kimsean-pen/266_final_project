Far beneath the blackened sun, mountains they rise
Far beneath the blackened sun, thunder the ice
Here reign the wicked realm, under cold open sky
Frostbitten world of utter dark Blashyrkh unlight

Far on thy reign
Gods as we ride
Kingdoms of black
To where raven fly

Far beneath the sky of ice, kingdoms they rule
Far beneath the sky of ice, winter and snow
Here within my wicked realm, open the gates
Throne of winterstorms I heart 'Blashyrkh Awaits'

Far on thy reign
Gods as we ride
Kingdoms of black
To where raven fly

Above the snow rise, frostcovered mount
Ravens up high, far up in the sky
The northern dark, where Winterkings rule
Far from the light
Gates to Blashyrkh Rise

Ravens up high, far up in the sky

Far beneath the blackened sun,
Mountains they rise
Far beneath the blackened sun
Thunder the ice
Far on thy reign
Gods as we ride
Throne of the sons
Of the northern darkness
