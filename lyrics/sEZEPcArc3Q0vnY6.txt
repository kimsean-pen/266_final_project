It's been years since you came around these parts of my mind
All I can recall is you restin' naked every time
You handcuffed yourself to your mother's bed that one night
You left the front door unlocked waiting for me to arrive home

I learned all about lust
Dominatrix, always thinking about myself
I used to wonder what I'd do without you

It's been years now and they saw my vices without shame
It's a beautiful world
The hips and levers tie me up in your room
I am grateful I found a lover, a queen
That shines right through the gloom
It's a beautiful world
The hips and levers tied me up in your room

She taught me to make love with patience
Not just thinkin' about myself, oh

You really feel the other person, oh my lover
What will I do without you?
And I wonder
What I'd do without you

Wouldn't have taught me love
Lays in front of me every morning

It's been years since you came around to these parts of my mind
All I can recall is you restin' naked every time
You handcuffed yourself to your mother's bed that one night
You left the front door unlocked waiting for me to arrive
