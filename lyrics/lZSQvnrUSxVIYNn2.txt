So this is goodbye
No need to lie;
This creature of pain
Has found me again.
So this is goodbye,
So this is farewell,
The fight's final bell
And I fall where I stand
So give your last hand
'cause this is goodbye
Tonight it's goodbye
Now I know why
Our love's lost in the rough
And I've had enough,
So this is goodbye
