Satan, savior, father
Lord, constructor of my world
Master, destroyer, redeemer
Guide me, I am the open wound

Under a frozen sun
Under a burning moon
All shall be revealed
Under the morning star

Lord, have mercy upon me
Guilt has ravaged this my flesh
Lord, have mercy upon me
Thine shall be this mortal soul

Son, messiah, deceiver
Pale like bloodless human veins
Sickness, darkness, decay
Mankind shall drown in its delusions

Under a frozen sun
Under a burning moon
All shall be revealed
Under the morning star

Lord, have mercy upon me
Guilt has ravaged this my flesh
Lord, have mercy upon me
Thine shall be this mortal soul

Bearer of light, thou haveth fallen from heaven
Evoke thy servants and release their eternal spell
My heart is black, my heart is dead
Spirits enter into me, let me ascend

Under a frozen sun
Under a burning moon
All shall be revealed
Under the morning star

Lord, have mercy upon me
Guilt has ravaged this my flesh
Lord, have mercy upon me
Thine shall be this mortal soul

Lie upon lie mankind shall die
Lie upon lie mankind shall die
Lie upon lie mankind shall die
Lie upon lie mankind shall die
