We sit and we sigh and nothing gets done
So right, so clued up, we just get old
And all the while been torn asunder
Nicotine and bacteria

We sit and we sigh and nothing gets done
So right, so clued up, we just get old
And all the while been torn asunder
Nicotine and bacteria

We sit and we sigh and nothing gets done
So right, so clued up, we just get old
And all the while been torn asunder
Nicotine and bacteria

We sit and we sigh and nothing gets done
So right, so clued up, we just get old
And all the while been torn asunder
Nicotine and bacteria

We sit and we sigh and nothing gets done
(What are we coming to?)
So right, so clued up, ae just get old
(What are we gonna do?)
And all the while been torn asunder
(What are we coming to?)
Nicotine and bacteria
(What are we gonna do?)
