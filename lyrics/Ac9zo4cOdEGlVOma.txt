we slept by the ottoman
autumn rushing to our ears
(a symphony of leaves kissing leaves kissing leaves)

this time last year, you were a ghost,
trapped in your room and spanning the length of your bed to your door
like it was the atlantic

what a difference a year makes!
steadier footing and a new place
to lay your head down
