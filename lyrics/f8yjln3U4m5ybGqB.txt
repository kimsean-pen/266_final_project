You're the one that I want to be with
Never wanna be separated
I'm captivated
Everyone says you're complicated
Every day you're my most awaited, oh
I'm captivated

Oh, they don't see you as I do
You are so beautiful
Come breathe within my soul
Let go

Oh, my love
You don't have to listen to a word they say
'Cause all that really matters is that I love you
I really do

Oh, I need you and I really hate it
But I'll never get tired of waiting
I'm captivated

Oh, they don't see you as I do
You are so beautiful
Come breathe within my soul
Let go

Oh, my love
You don't have to listen to a word they say
'Cause all that really matters is that I love you
I really do

Oh, my love
You don't have to listen to a word they say
'Cause all that really matters is that I love you
I really do
