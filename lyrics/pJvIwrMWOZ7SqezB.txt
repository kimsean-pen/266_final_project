Call me darer
Call me diamonds
Call me crass
Or call me cruel

Call me daddy
Call me baby
Call me friend
Or call me fool

Call me creeper
Call me creature
Call me anytime you need
Cause my blood is made of whiskey
So you can come get drunk on me

I don't want to be you
You don't want to be me
I don't want to be you
You don't want to be me
I don't want to be you
You don't want to be me
I don't want to be

Call me up
Call me in the morning
Sticking your thorn in
If that's what you need
You can call me anything, baby
It will not change me
I'll still be me

Call me vicious
Call me violent
You can call me silent
You can call me lamb
Call me perverted
Call me perfect
You can call me woman
Call me man

I don't want to be you
You don't want to be me
I don't want to be you
You don't want to be me
I don't want to be you
You don't want to be me
I don't want to be

Call me up
Call me in the morning
Sticking your thorn in
If that's what you need
You can call me anything, baby
It will not change me
I'll still be me

Lipstick stuck all over my mirror
I'm a forgiver, I'm a forgiver
Lipstick stuck all over my mirror
I'm a forgiver, I'm a forgiver
Lipstick stuck all over my mirror
I'm a forgiver, I'm a forgiver
Lipstick stuck all over my mirror
I'm a forgiver, I'm a forgiver
Lipstick stuck all over my mirror
I'm a forgiver, I'm a forgiver
Lipstick stuck all over my mirror
