ladies and gentlemen
we are in a little bit of a predicament
he said take your time
but didn't back his words
heroes and holy ghosts
which one of you steps
on the others' toes
and then risks his neck like
it's a moving target?
you?

was that just you being stubborn?
can't you say pretty please?
wasn't it an eggshell carpet
that brought you to your knees?
if the right built the anchor
and the wrong have set sail
i'm a whale, i'm a well, i'm a whale

busy bees and worry worts

we are not in the business of fireworks
or turning heads
that whistle in the dark
sitting ducks and guinea pigs
are the first to catch word
of straws in the wind don't stop them
remember this it's just two cents
two cents never made you rich

was that just you being stubborn?
can't you say pretty please?
wasn't it an eggshell carpet
that brought you to your knees?
if the right built the anchor
and the wrong have set sail
i'm a whale, I'm a well, I'm a whale
you?

i've shown my white feathers.!

was that just you being stubborn?
can't you say pretty please?
wasn't it an eggshell carpet
that brought you to your knees?
if the right built the anchor
and the wrong have set sail
i'm a whale, I'm a well, I'm a whale
