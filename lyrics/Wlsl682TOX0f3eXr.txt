Halo's of diamonds dancing over your head
My eyes are silver lining lace in your bed
Chasing golden days
Here they come
Here they come

You keep my satisfaction for yourself
I give you something real with no one else
You take the money
And I take you as you are

Tell me what you want
Don't you know that you got everything you need?
Oh, no
I wanna take it all
I could satisfy your dollar sign dreams
Dollar sign dreams

Walking a lot to an isle in the sand
Driving the fantasy as deep as you can
Waiter on your waist
Here they come
Here they come

I'm just your dusty bottle up on the shelf
Wish I could realise your visions of wealth
You take the money
But I take you as you are

Tell me what you want
Don't you know that you got everything you need?
Oh, no
I wanna take it all
I could satisfy your dollar sign dreams
Dollar sign dreams

Franklin ain't no friend of mine
Tired of chasing your dollar signs
See your mink hit the marble floor

Keeps me coming back for more

Tell me what you want
Don't you know that you got everything you need?
Oh
I wanna take it all
I could satisfy your dollar sign dreams
Dollar sign dreams
Tell me what you want
Don't you know that you got everything you need?
Everything you need
I wanna take it all
I could satisfy your dollar sign dreams
Dollar sign dreams
