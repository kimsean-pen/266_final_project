What you want is just outside your reach
You keep on searchin'
You're walking down that Pensacola beach
You keep repeatin'

While you're waiting for that sound
Apparatus to the ground
You're stealing from the lost and found
But what you find
Ain't what you had in mind

Until you find your Rolex in the sand
You won't be stopping
Until that solid gold is in your hand
You'll be happy
Call your office on the phone
Say you won't be coming home
You fell into
Vacations on our own
