Just a little sleep
A little slumber
Little folding of the hands to rest
It's what we tell ourselves but we know we're gonna just
Lay here 'til the sun's gone west
But there are foxes in the garden
And there's an old man at the door
When the wind is right and the skies show favor
When the heat has died and the day is cool
We tell ourselves that we'll do it later
When we know full well that that ain't true
And now there's wolves at every window
The man is breaking down the door
Come on we gotta wake up
We gotta wake up
We gotta wake up
I hear them coming back for more
Gotta wake up
Oh, we say we'll do it when things settle down
We say we'll do it when we the season's through
We say we'll do it when we get around to it
But it's already overdue
And there are foxes in the garden
And there's an old man at the door
Tomorrow's song is a siren singing
Such a sweet and sudden lullaby
Tomorrow's song has got us clinging
To the promise of the by-and-by
And now there's wolves at every window
The man is breaking down the door
Come on we gotta wake up
We gotta wake up
We gotta wake up
I hear them coming back for more
Come on we gotta wake up
We gotta wake up
We gotta wake up
Mmm I think they're gathering for war
We gotta wake up
We gotta wake up
We gotta wake up
We gotta wake up
I hear them coming back for more
Come on we gotta wake up
We gotta wake up
We gotta wake up
Oh I think they're gathering for war
