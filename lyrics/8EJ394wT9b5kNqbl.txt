This shouldn't exist
And yet, here it stands
The lives it's cost
The energy it demands
The concrete beast
The concrete beast
Has devoured the land
Vandalize the rubble
Crooked catwalk
Slopes hard to the right
There's no windows
In the unknown
Architect's design
If you could only see
The view from the balcony

Like a flood of bricks and steel
Like a flood of bricks and steel

Bricks and steel
Buildings fused together
Impossible architecture
Like a flood of bricks and steel

Buildings fused together
Impossible architecture
