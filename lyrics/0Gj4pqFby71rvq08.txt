Never been so inside
When I give in to you
Never been so existent
You can't know unless you feel it
Come back
Body's aching
From the want and the waiting
I get this pain when you're leaving
Never felt this before
Never felt this before
Is it written on my back (yeah)
Take it back and then let it go
Let it go
Is it written on my back (yeah)
Take it back and then let it go
Mm hmm
Every day is the day that you save me
Light into darkness
Cut on the sharpness of you
Never been so inside it
And falling into you
Never been so resistant
You can't fall unless you feel it
Come back
Body's aching
From the want and the waiting
Coming down with a sickness
Mm hmm
Stay under control
Steady and in control
Is it written on my back (yeah)
Take it back and then let it go
Let it go
Is it written on my back
Take it back and then let it go
Mm hmm
Every day is the day that you save me
Light into darkness
Cut on the sharpness of you
I want to love you baby
Come back
Body's aching
From the want and the waiting
I get this pain when you're leaving
Never felt this before
Never felt this before
Is it written on my back (yeah)
Take it back and then let it go
Let it go
Is it written on my back
Take it back and then let it go
Let it go
