Drinking from the steaming street
Filling up my lungs with heat
Breathing out all that anger
Trying to find some inner peace

Channels trying to run me down
Telling me it ain't my town
Be that it as it may
I'm cashing in my favor now

Hid it in the basement
Gotta keep it safe somehow

But it's really quite a shame that it's gone to waste
I was hoping to bring some home
As I slowly roller-skate through a wall of hate
I was hoping to save my soul, but what's it for?

Jumping down that hill again
Bodied by the Russian wind
Let her reach the engine
Wonder why the light's so dim

Listen to your roommates honk
Down the hall as I woke up
Chin aches on my hardwood
Think I'll pour myself a cup

Sister for the weekend
Love you still when Monday comes

But it's really quite a shame that it's gone to waste
I was starting to feel so cold
Feel like everyday's such a piece of cake
I was trying to bring some home
As I slowly roller-skate through a wall of hate
I was hoping to save my soul, but what's it for?
