Will you join me in this dance, this dance of misery?
Cradled in imposs- impossibility?
Swooning, I am swept away
Swept off my feet, with step by step by step
We take the lead as drop by drop, we start to bleed

(Oh, we dance in misery)
And we dance on, and we dance on
(Oh, we dance in misery)
All lost in the arms of our misery, oh
(Oh, we dance in misery)
And we dance on, and we dance on
Swept off our feet by our misery, we're swept into shadows

Will you lend yourself to beauty that will horrify?
Let me hide within your black, the still inside your eyes
Deafened, caught within a cry
So sensual as step by step by step I seperate
As breath to breath, as I suffocate

(Oh, we dance in misery)
And we dance on, and we dance on
(Oh, we dance in misery)
All lost in the arms of our misery, oh
(Oh, we dance in misery)
And we dance on, and we dance on
Swept off our feet by our misery, we're swept into shadows

An' so who will follow? Who is the lead?
I know I'll leave a stain because I bleed
As we dance, we all dance
We all have no chance in this horrid romance

I quit
(Oh, we dance in misery)
And we dance on and we dance on
(Oh, we dance in misery)
All lost in the arms of our misery, oh
(Oh, we dance in misery)
And we dance on and we dance on
Swept off our feet by our misery, we're swept into shadows
Swept off our feet by our misery, we're swept into shadows
Yeah!
