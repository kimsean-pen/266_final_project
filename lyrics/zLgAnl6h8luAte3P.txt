Let's ride ten miles up
Just inside the stratosphere
More sky, more blue jets
Stream by, you're gonna love it here


Let's fly ten miles up
Just outside the atmosphere
We'll climb, oh straight up
Set aside your rational fear


Goodbye, oh little cruel world
Never again will I ever be grounded on Earth or be bound by the hurt in you
Blue eyes offer a brave new world
Out in the starry skies of paradise found


As we rise so far above
Our little lights, in miniature
And even your eyes can be transfixed
Knock, knock, knock it down, your heavenly door


One mile in, it keeps pulling me back
Have you got to ever leave?
Higher now, there's no turning back
Gone in the blink of an eye


Goodbye, oh little cruel world
Never again will I ever be grounded on Earth or be bound by the hurt in you
Blue eyes offer a brave new world
Out in the starry skies of paradise found


Lift me off the ground
Then I look down
Sing a sad goodbye
This city is a torn town
Left the law behind
Straight up for miles
Or you can hang down
An alternative never given very much for you
Never be ten miles high


We'll defy right by your side
Come fill your eyes with its majesty
The tears you'll cry in the water mist
Leave it all behind and come with me


Goodbye, cruel world
Never again will I ever be grounded on Earth or be bound by the hurt in you
Blue eyes, brave new world
Out in the starry skies of paradise found
