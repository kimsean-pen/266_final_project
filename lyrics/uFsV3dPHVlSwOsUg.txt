Trippin' out, spinnin' around
I'm underground
I fell down
Yeah, I fell down

I'm freaking out, where am I now?
Upside down
And I can't stop it now
It can't stop me now, oh, oh
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive

When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, I won't cry
I'll play the game
But I can't stay

I've got my head on straight
And I'm not gonna change
I'm not gonna change
I'll win the race
Keep up with the pace
Today's the day
That I start to pray
You can't get in my way, oh, oh
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive

When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, I won't cry
I found myself in Wonderland

Get back on my feet, on the ground
Is this real? Is this pretend?
I'll take a stand until the end
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive

When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, I won't cry
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, and I won't cry
