I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas eve with fondue
With a love like this
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Christmas eve will find me
With a love like this
Well I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
