Yeah, she rolls back
About 4 AM until I know that
3 AM, we chat, she thinks I know jack
Shit it's been a while since I spat in this pit
Saw the worry on her lips, yeah I wrote that
She's pinging on some dizz, guess I owe a lot to that

But her eyes are still in lid
And her brain is still intact
She swings solo

Yeah, she likes to reinstate that
She's been up for days with a strange pack
She's looking for a guy who's more than laid back
And not the Holden type, the ride by J.D. Salinger
But she likes my Slazenger
The way it holds slack
Lanky piece of shit, but she don't know that
Her man is 'round the corner with a chrome bat
He wants to knock my head in, hear my bone crack

So I'll stay solo
Yeah, I'll fly solo
Oh I'll swing solo
Yeah, we stay solo
