Laid low by heart break
And I'm gonna let you know
I'm gonna let you know
So clear and wide awake

I'm begging to let you know
Know that you can...

Take me home
I'm learning to live with ghosts
The limbs I miss the most
Take me home
I'm learning to live with ghosts
The skin I miss the most

Laid low by heart ache
I'm trying to stay afloat
Keeping the light down low
Let go of our restraint

I'm begging to let you know
Know that you can...

Take me home
I'm learning to live with ghosts
The limbs I miss the most
Take me home
I'm learning to live with ghosts
The skin I miss the most

All the love we (All the love we)
All the love we had is fading (Laid low)
Fading (Laid low)
All the love we (All the love we)
All the love we had is fading (Laid low)
Fading (Laid low)
All the love we (All the love we)
All the love we had is fading (Laid low)
Fading (Laid low)
All the love we (All the love we)
All the love we had is fading (Laid low)

Take me home
I'm learning to live with ghosts
The limbs I miss the most
Take me home
I'm learning to live with ghosts
The skin I miss the most

Take me home
All the love we (All the love we)
All the love we had is fading (Laid low)
Fading (Laid low)
Take me home
All the love we (All the love we)
All the love we had is fading (Laid low)
Fading (Laid low)
Take me home
All the love we (All the love we)
All the love we had is fading (Laid low)
Fading (Laid low)
Take me home
All the love we (All the love we)
All the love we had is fading (Laid low)
Fading (Laid low)
