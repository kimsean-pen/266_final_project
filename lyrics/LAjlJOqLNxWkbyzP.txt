I'll build the stairs
To the stars, babe
Just hold me, just hold me
I'll build the stairs
To the stars, babe
Just hold me, just hold me

Part of me just wishes I could
Be a different kind of sinner
When bullets meet the opposition
Man no one's a winner
Fucking up but swear to god
That I'll change it
Give me a chance to win
Your love and I'll take it
Part of me just wishes I could
Be a different kind of sinner
When bullets meet the opposition
Man no one's a winner
Fucking up but swear to god

That I'll change it

Give me a chance to win

Your love and I'll take it

I'm better now
Riding round top down
Made some mistakes, but I'm back up now
Back up now
Shut me down
That's okay, it's old news now
Just watch me drown
You love to see that shit
Finger out
While I'm sinking in
Digging deeper
Secret keeper
Evil speaker
'Til I meet the reaper
Draw my frown with
A permanent pen
Search for peace
I'll find it again
I'm blinded again
By violent words
Oh god it hurts
But still I stand
I'm still one man
With my own chains
Can't seem to break

What I've made
Everybody loves you when you pass away

Now ask away
If you think I'm okay, no

Yeah I know how it feels to be alone
I know how it feels to be around people and feel alone like
I'll be around other people and like still feel alone like
Even sometimes, like hard, like I'll go out even with my old friends

Like my previous friends

And I'll just feel alone
And I just
You know I'm in a position now where-

I was friends with a lot of people and then I kinda felt dependent
I've seen people choose material items over me
I've seen people choose...

Part of me just wishes I could
Be a different kind of sinner
When bullets meet the opposition
Man no one's a winner
Fucking up but swear to god
That I'll change it

Give me a chance to win
Your love and I'll take it

Part of me just wishes I could
Be a different kind of sinner
When bullets meet the opposition
Man no one's a winner

Fucking up but swear to god
That I'll change it
Give me a chance to win
Your love and I'll take it

I'll build the stairs
To the stars, babe
Just hold me, just hold me
I'll build the stairs
To the stars, babe
Just hold me, just hold me
I'll build the stairs
To the stars, babe
Just hold me...
