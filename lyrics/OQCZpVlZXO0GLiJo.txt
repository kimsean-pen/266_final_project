Is it too late? Nothing to salvage
You look away, clear all the damage
The meaning to all words of love has disappeared

We used to love one another, give to each other
Lie under covers so, are you friend or foe?
Love one another, live for each other
So, are you friend or foe? 'Cause I used to know

The promises, hollow concessions
And innocent show of affection
I touch your hand, a hologram, are you still there?

We used to love one another, give to each other
Lie under covers so, are you friend or foe?
Love one another, live for each other
So, are you friend or foe? 'Cause I used to know

We used to, we used to
We used to, used to, used to

Is it too late? Nothing to salvage
You look away, clear all the damage
The meaning to all words of love has disappeared

We used to love one another, give to each other
Lie under covers so, are you friend or foe?
Love one another, live for each other
So, are you friend or foe? 'Cause I used to know

Love one another, give to each other
Lie under covers so, are you friend or foe?
Love one another, live for each other
So, are you friend or foe? 'Cause I used to know
'Cause I used to know, are you friend or foe?
Lie under covers so, are you friend or foe?
Love one another, live for each other
So, are you friend or foe?
Friend or foe, friend or foe, friend or foe
