You're a fire,
Burning up in my brain.
You can't be tamed for me.
You struck a match and left me to burn.
It doesn't feel right.
To feel the weight of your world, the weight of your world in my spine.
You've had me going out of my mind.

I wanna feel something,
That's not the touch of your breath on my neck.
I wanna feel something,
That's not the weight of your world in my head.
And all the walls are caving in,
And I feel you entering.
I shouldn't give in, but I let you win.
I let you in.

Find a new place,
Another space to invade,
Another brain to decay,
With your presence, with your ghost.
I'm growing sick in the head trying to push you out of it.
I said it and I'll say it again,
I won't let you in.

I wanna feel something,
That's not the touch of your breath on my neck.
I wanna feel something,
That's not the weight of your world in my head.
And all the walls are caving in,
And I feel you entering.
I shouldn't give in, but I let you win.
I let you in.

Caving in,
Entering,

I wanna feel something,
That's not the touch of your breath on my neck.
I wanna feel something,
That's not the weight of your world in my head.
And all the walls are caving in,
And I feel you entering.
I shouldn't give in, but I let you win.
I let you in.
