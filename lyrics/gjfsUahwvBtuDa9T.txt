She cast stars 'cross the hidden lake
shadowed from the skies
brilliantly in the twilight
silver tears of life

fathoms of hidden seas
in pearl black oblivion
I see the treasured light
from the dark deep below me

in silence she reaches out
to pull me

the darkness will cleanse my eyes
and hold me

from shattered silvery shells the dawn
bursts upon my eyes
take from me the gift of morning-
paradisiac light

swallowing fragments
of a blinding lambent beauty
gold sequined waters fall
from the skies high above me

in silence she reaches out
to pull me

the darkness will cleanse my eyes
and hold me

the darkness will cleanse my eyes
and hold me
