Stay and keep me up
And I'll try not to drift away
But it's on the days I don't pick up
That I can't find the words or answers that you need to hear from me

I knew we'd sink but I still jumped in

So if you're going me under don't let me go
Let's just drown inside the things we love the most
And you can say what you want and that's okay
But we found the reasons that we needed to walk away

And we knew even if it killed us we just let it pull us in
We carried more than we could take
Hoping somewhere along the line that it would all fall into place

In the end you can't stop the wind

So if you're going me under don't let me go
Let's just drown inside the things we love the most
And you can say what you want and that's okay
But we found the reasons that we needed to walk away

I knew we'd sink but for some reason I still jumped in
Because in the end after everything we did you can't stop the wind

So if you're going me under don't let me go
Let's just drown inside the things we love the most
And you can say what you want and that's okay
But we found the reasons that we needed to walk away
Even if we found a way it would never be the same
