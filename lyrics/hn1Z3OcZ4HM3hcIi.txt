You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis

Everythin's in order in a black hole
Nothin' seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lackin' in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

Oh, the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Not as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem, my love, when you dream them up

Flickin' through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessin' that she'd rather just forget it

Clingin' to not gettin' sentimental
Said she wasn't goin' but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a bettin' pencil?

Oh, the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem, my love, when you dream them up

Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go, oh

You're fallin' about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You were just soundin' it out
But you're not comin' back again

You're fallin' about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You were just soundin' it out
But you're not comin' back again

You used to get it in your fishnets (fallin' about)
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness (you took a left off Last Laugh Lane)
Landed in a very common crisis
Everythin's in order in a black hole
Nothin' seems as pretty as the past though (you were just soundin' it out)
That Bloody Mary's lackin' in Tabasco (you're not comin' back again)
Remember when you used to be a rascal?
