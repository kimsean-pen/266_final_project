You've sacrificed my life
Downward spiral to the same old nothingness
Constant grab holds with your relentless self-consumed
You've dragged me to your fucking hell hole, buried the sun
Numb and caged down similar spirals
Collapsing inner selves, rupturing minds
All hope is gone
Non-existence pathway you brought to my life
All hope is gone
You've dragged me to your fucking hell hole, buried the sun
