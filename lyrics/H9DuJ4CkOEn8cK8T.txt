The dust and dirt
Blind us slowly
But give a hint of a view to make it feel alright
And though it hurts
We keep on climbing
Cause our addictions take us from inside
A sturdy back
But brittle bones
Too weak to show

We would say anything just to hear what we want
Right or wrong
Then we lie to be forgiven
We would sell anything just to buy who we're not
Any cost
We kill our way to heaven
We kill our way to heaven

We search alone
For golden crowns
Cause if we find it we'll have it all to ourselves
So one by one
We lay our bricks down
To pave a road on the shoulders of somebody else
A sturdy back
But brittle bones
Too weak to show

We would say anything just to hear what we want
Right or wrong
Then we lie to be forgiven
We would sell anything just to buy who we're not
Any cost
We kill our way to heaven

We would say anything just to hear what we want
Right or wrong
Then we lie to be forgiven
We would sell anything just to buy who we're not
Any cost
We kill our way to heaven

We kill our way to heaven
