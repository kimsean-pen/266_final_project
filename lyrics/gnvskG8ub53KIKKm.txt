Desire, whispered, spoken
In time
Rivers, oceans

That ain't me babe,
That ain't me babe,
That ain't me babe
I'm just content to relax
Than drown within myself

Of mind
Sheltered, broken
Denied, gifted, stolen

That ain't me babe,
That ain't me babe,
That ain't me babe
Ain't got a bed of excuse for myself

That ain't me babe

That ain't me babe
Ain't got a bed of excuse for myself

That ain't me babe,
That ain't me babe,
That ain't me babe
I'm just content to relax
Than drown within myself
