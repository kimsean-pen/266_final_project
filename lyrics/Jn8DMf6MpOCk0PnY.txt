Like a grain of sand that wants to be a rolling stone
I want to be the man I'm not and have the things
I really haven't got and that's a lot

There'll be joy and there'll be laughter
Something big is what I'm after now
Yes, it's what I'm after now

After taking, I take up giving
Something big is what I'm living for
Yes, it's what I'm living for, living for

Why do I go on and fill my life
With little things
When there are big things I must do?

And lots of dreams
That really should come true
Before I'm through

There'll be joy and there'll be laughter
Something big is what I'm after now
Yes, it's what I'm after now

After taking, I take up giving
Something big is what I'm living for
Yes, it's what I'm living for, living for

After taking, I take up giving
Something big is what I'm living for
Yes, it's what I'm living for

After taking, I take up giving
Something big is what I'm living for
Yes, it's what I'm living for, living for

After taking, I take up giving
Something big is what I'm living for
Yes, it's what I'm living for, living for

After taking, I take up giving
Something big is what I'm living for
Yes, it's what I'm living for, living for

After taking, take up giving
Something big is what I'm living for
