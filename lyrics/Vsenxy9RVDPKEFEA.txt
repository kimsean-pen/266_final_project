give me the cost as the albatross
and wear it 'round your neck for size
don't let it get you down
i'm looking inside your house
I know that it smells so nice
your house always looks so nice

bear the crosses high laughing
maybe the time is right you know
promise me not to leave
i'm looking inside your brain
christ it's a cluttered mess
i love you i must confess

la la la la la...
