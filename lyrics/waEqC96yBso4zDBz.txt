A cheap holiday in other people's misery!

I don't wanna holiday in the sun
I wanna go to new Belsen
I wanna see some history
'Cause now I got a reasonable economy

Now I got a reason, now I got a reason
Now I got a reason and I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason
Now I got reason to be waiting
The Berlin Wall

Sensurround sound in a two-inch wall
Well I was waiting for the communist call
I dared to ask for sunshine, and I got World War three
I'm looking over the wall and they're looking at me!

Now I got a reason, now I got a reason
Now I got a reason and I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason
Now I got a reason to be waiting
The Berlin Wall

They're staring all night and
They're staring all day
I had no reason to be here at all
But now i gotta reason it's no real reason
And I'm waiting at Berlin Wall

I'm gonna go over the Berlin Wall
I don't understand this thing at all
I gonna go over and over the Berlin Wall
I'm gonna go over the Berlin Wall
I'm gonna go over the Berlin Wall

Claustrophobia there's too much paranoia
There's too many closets oh when will we fall?
And now I gotta reason
It's no real reason to be waiting
The Berlin Wall

I gotta go over the Wall
I don't understand this thing at all
It's third rate
Cheap dialogue, cheap essential scenery
I gotta go over the wall
I wanna go over the Berlin Wall
Before me come over the Berlin Wall
I don't understand this bit at all...
I'm gonna go over the wall
I'm gonna go over the Berlin Wall
I'm gonna go over the Berlin Wall
Before me come over the Berlin Wall
I don't understand this thing at all
Please don't be waiting for me
