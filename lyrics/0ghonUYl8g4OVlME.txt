Ahhh, I love to look into your big brown eyes
They talk to me and seem to hypnotize
They say the things nobody dares to say
And I'm not about to let you fly away
My lover with no jet lag
We're stayin' up all night in my sleeping bag
You got a heart beatin' rhythm
From the subterranean
I really love you little girl
I don't need to explain
I love you 'cause your Deuces are Wild girl
Like a double shot of love is so fine
I been lovin' you since you was a child girl
'Cause you an' me is two of a kind
Ahhh, like deja vu I feel like I been here
Or somewhere else but you been always near
It's you that's in my dreams I'm beggin' for
But I woke up when someone slammed the door
So hard I fell outta bed
Screamin' mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread
And the moral of the story I can testify
I get stoned on you girl
That's the best reason why
I love you 'cause your Deuces are Wild girl
Like a double shot of love is so fine
I been lovin' you since you was a child girl
'Cause you an' me is two of a kind
I love you 'cause your Deuces are Wild girl
Like a double shot of love is so fine
I been lovin' you since you was a child girl
'Cause you an' me is two of a kind
I love you 'cause your Deuces are Wild girl
Like a double shot of love is so fine
I been lovin' you since you was a child girl
'Cause you an' me is two of a kind
I love you 'cause your Deuces are Wild girl
Like a double shot of love is so fine
I been lovin' you since you was a child girl
'Cause you an' me is two of a kind
I love you 'cause your Deuces are Wild girl
Ya know I finally need it so bad
I been lovin' you since you was a child girl
'Cause you an' me is two of a kind
