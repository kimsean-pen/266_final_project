I will crawl on concrete and dust
Asphalt jungle, piles of crust

Nonsense thoughts inside the mind
What really means? What I want?

Open up your mind and go your own way
Open up your mind and go your own way
Open up your mind and go your own way
Open up your mind and go your own way

Straight old thoughts to force you down
Raping race, breed apart

Open up your mind and go your own way
Open up your mind and go your own way
Open up your mind and go your own way
Open up your mind and go your own way

Open up your mind and go your own way
Open up your mind and go your own way
Open up your mind and go your own way
Open up your mind!
