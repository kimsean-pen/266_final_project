Just like a ship)
Without a sail
(Without a sail)
Just like a ship
(Just like a ship)
Without a sail
(Without a sail)
But I'm not worried because I know
(But I know we can take it)
I know
(But I know we can take it)
I know we can shake it
(But I know we can take it)
I know we can take it
(But I know we can take it)
I sail for pleasure
(I sail for pleasure)
But I found pain
(But I found pain)
I look for sunshine
yes I did (I look for sunshine)
But I found rain
(But I found rain)
And then I look for my friends
(I look for my friends)
They all walked away
(But they walked away)
Trew all the sorrows
(Trew all of the sorrows)
You can hear me say
(You can hear me say)
Hey, hey, hey, I know
(But I know we can take it)
Just to know one thing, but I know
(But I know...) Sure gonna make it
I know we can shake it
(But I know...) 'Cause we are proud people
I know we can take it
(But I know we can take it)
(Just like a ship without a sail)
(We did our work today)
(Just like a ship without a sail)
(We did our work today)
(Just like a ship)
Without a sail
(Without a sail)
Just like a ship
(Just like a ship)
Lord knows I don't have a sail
(Without a sail)
Hey, hey, but I know
(But I know we can take it)
Hey, I know
(But I know we can take it)
I know we can shake it
(But I know we can take it)
I know we can take it
(But I know we can take it)
