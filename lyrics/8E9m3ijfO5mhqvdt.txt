Everybody is tired and poor
And sick of trying
If you see me on the corner
Will you stop or will you splash me?
Take a look at what we've become
Nothing more than silhouettes of
A pretty family on a postcard
Picture perfect, I don't want it

So I hold my breath 'til my heart explodes
'Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can sell my body but you can't sell my soul
'Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes

Shitty weather, bad timing
Lucky penny glued to the ground
Dirty look from total stranger
Hope you get lost and you're not found
Take a look at what we've become
Nothing more than silhouettes of
A pretty family on a postcard
Picture perfect, I don't want it
So I hold my breath 'til my heart explodes

'Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can sell my body but you can't sell my soul
'Cause this is how it is and this is how it
This is how it, it goes

This is how it, it goes
This is how it, it goes
This is how it, it goes
So unscrew my head

And rinse it out
Polish my thoughts
Turn into doubts
Unscrew my head
And rinse it out
Polish my thoughts
Turn into doubts
Turn 'em into
Turn 'em into doubts
So I hold my breath 'til my heart explodes
'Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can sell my body but you can't sell my soul
'Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
