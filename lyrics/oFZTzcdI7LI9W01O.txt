I wait for you to say the words I want to be true
But you don't say anything, do you?

Let it all come out. Restless heart, lazy mouth.
But you don't say anything, do you?

I would wait all my days to hear the words I need you to say
To keep me hanging on and not walking away
But you don't say anything, do you?

Felt so wrong, held my tongue over long distance phones.
Now I'm not holding anything back from you.

I would wait all my days to hear the words I need you to say
To keep me hanging on and not walking away
But you don't say anything, do you?

I can't wait another day to say the words I always wanted say
And darling, I pray you feel the same way
All I want to say is I love you
All I want to say... All I want to say is I love you.
