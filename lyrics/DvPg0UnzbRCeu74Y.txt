Walk me down to the wishing well
Help me find that miracle
Splash that holy water on me
Drown my faith in trinity, yeah
Oh yeah

Little by little, gonna get it, I swear
One more piece of the puzzle, I'm there
Gotta get lucky, gotta get that done
Little bit of luck never hurt no one

Come on take me down down down...
I'm in a cold sweat
Lord don't let me drown drown drown drown
In mother earth's soul, yet

Under darken skies
We'll see the light

Broken now I can't help but feel
Someone cracked the seventh seal
Nothing sacred
Nothing left unturned
When nothing's simple
Then nothing's learned

So take me down to the virgin spring
Wash away my suffering, oh
Splash that holy water on me
Wash my eyes so I can see

Come on take me down down down...
I'm in a cold sweat
Lord don't let me drown drown drown drown
In mother earth's soul, yet
Lord, i think i found found found...
My mother lode, hey
Down down down down down down
Take me down down down down
Take me
