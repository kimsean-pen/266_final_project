Baby girl, I'm not quite human
And I'm not quite a machine
So I guess that leaves you staring
At something that's somewhere in between

Yeah, I'm another hungry lover
But I was born a different breed
Yeah, I can shake you but then I'll break you
And baby, sweat is guaranteed

I wish I could give you my love and my soul
But inside my chest there is nobody home

My heart may be missing
But my hands will make up for it
Don't think this is innocent
I'll sink my teeth right into it

My eyes and my mouth agree
You'll be coming home with me
'Cause girl, you know, 'cause girl, you know
'Cause girl, you know I'm an animal, animal
I'm just a animal, animal

Girl, you locked the door behind you
When you walked into my room
And your eyes have got me thinking
That maybe there's a different side of you

'Cause when I'm attacking, your nails are scratching
So I wonder could it be
That when your clothes fall to your feet
You could be an animal like me

I wish I could give you my love and my soul
But inside my chest there is nobody home

My heart may be missing
But my hands will make up for it
Don't think this is innocent
I'll sink my teeth right into it

My eyes and my mouth agree
You'll be coming home with me
'Cause girl, you know, 'cause girl, you know
'Cause girl, you know I'm an animal, animal
I'm just a animal, animal

Crawling on your hands and knees slowly
Oh but to me, reach out to touch my face, anticipation
Push me up against the wall, whispers
And nicks and all these tricks you try and pull, manipulation

My heart may be missing
But my hands will make up for it
Don't think this is innocent
I'll sink my teeth right into it

My eyes and my mouth agree
You'll be coming home with me
'Cause girl, you know, 'cause girl, you know
'Cause girl, you know I'm an animal, animal
I'm just a animal, animal
