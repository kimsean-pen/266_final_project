Wooden Jesus, where are you from?
Korea or Canada or maybe Taiwan
But I didn't know it was the Holy Land
But I believed from the minute the check left my hand

And I pray, can I be saved?
I spent all my money on a future grave
Wooden Jesus, I'll cut you in
On twenty percent of my future sin
I'll cut you in

In porcelain Mary, her majesties pure
Looking for virgin territory
Coat hanger halos, they don't come cheap
From television shepherds with living room sheep

And I pray can I be saved?
I spent all my money on a future grave
Wooden Jesus, I'll cut you in
On twenty percent of my future sin
I'll cut you in, I'll cut you in

Wooden Jesus, where are you from?
Korea or Canada or maybe Taiwan
But I didn't know it was the Holy Land
But I believed from the minute the check left my hand

Can I be saved?
I spent all my money on a future grave
Wooden Jesus, I'll cut you in
On twenty percent of my future sin
I'll cut you in, I'll cut you in, I'll cut you in, I'll cut you in
I'll cut you in, I'll cut you in
