Do you feel higher as a liar?
Feeling in need and greedy
Do you double in the fire?
When the devil is asleep
Do you like a brothers woman?
Let your hands say what they want
Do you like to be the villain?
If you do then come
If you think is something
If you missed me than Id know it
I think that this is how it should be
If you think that your word, presence are a crazy story
Baby come along with me
Angry lady, turning me crazy
Angry lady, still miss me behaving
Youre crazy just like me
Make me angry, you make me angry
Make me angry
You know Im mad, Im mad
Im mad, Im mad
I am down in the daylight
Are you happy when it rains?
Does the night make you feel alive?
Feel the dark in your veins
Do you like a little substance?
Do you like a little?
Do the hot in every moment
Make your life worth living
If you think is something
If you missed me than Id know it
I think that this is how it should be
If you think that your word, presence are a crazy story
Baby come along with me
Angry lady, turning me crazy
Angry lady, still miss me behaving
Youre crazy just like me
Make me angry, you make me angry
Make me angry
You know Im mad, Im mad
Im mad, Im mad
Now I get the feeling that well be alright
This life is worth living when you and I are fine
So let nobody tell you that your soul aint right
Because you need the darkness to enjoy the light
Angry lady, turning me crazy
Angry lady, still miss me behaving
Youre crazy just like me
Make me angry, you make me angry
Make me angry
You know Im mad, Im mad
Im mad, Im mad
Angry lady, turning me crazy
Angry lady, still miss me behaving
Youre crazy just like me
Make me angry, you make me angry
Make me angry
You know Im mad, Im mad
Im mad, Im mad
You know what I want
You know what I want
