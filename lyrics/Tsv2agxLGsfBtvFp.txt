So many guillotines and yet,
I have never lost my head.
Like Cassius Clay back in Zaire,
It is my wits that brought me here.

I never thought that it would show
That there's a leak in every boat.
And this one is sinking,
I'm sure it's sinking now.
Somewhere there's a lighthouse,
But the light has gone out.

And if it's sinking,
If this boat is sinking now,
You'd steal the sea I'm in.
You'd steal the sea...

You cut and my heart broke in two,
But separately each part still grew.
Now one is false and one is true;
The first of these I ascribe to you.

I stole the hearts from the rich girls,
And gave them to the poor.
I wish I could steal them all back,
In case I'd find a shore.

'Cause this boat is sinking,
I'm sure it's sinking now.
Off to the lighthouse,
I must find it somehow.

And if it's sinking,
If this boat is sinking now...
You'll steal the sea I'm in.
You'll steal the sea I'm in.
