Most sentimental nights
I'm in your sights
Shoot me down

There ain't no enemy here
You keep me very near
And shoot me down
Shoot me down

Your hands, they flutter up
Armed and dangerous
My buttercup
Shoot me down
In flames

Stand back, baby
Stand back and let me breathe
I think I'm fallin' out of here
I can hear the grass grow
I can hear the melting snow
I can feel your breath against my ear
I might just disappear
Wouldn't that be nice?
Yea wouldn't that be nice?
Well wouldn't that be nice?

I look into your eyes
Comes as no great surprise
You're gonna shoot me down
Shoot me down

I know that when you smile
It will only be just a short little while
Shoot me down
In flames

Shoot me down (shoot me down)
In flames (shoot me down)
Shoot me down (shoot me down)
In flames (shoot me down)
You're gonna shoot me down (shoot me down)
Oh in flames (shoot me down)
Shoot me down
Shoot me down
In flames
