Just about the time the shadows call
I undress my mind and dare you to follow
Paint a portrait of my mystery
Only close my eyes and you are here with me
A nameless face to think I see
To sit and watch the waves with me till they're gone
A heart I'd swear I'd recognize is
Made out of my own devices... could I be wrong?

Time that I've taken
Pray is not wasted

Have I already tasted my piece of
One sweet love?
Sleepless nights you creep inside of me
Paint your shadows on the breath that we share
You take more than just my sanity
Take my reason not to care.

No ordinary wings I'll need
The sky itself will carry me back to you
Things I dream that I can do

I'll open up the moon for you
Just come down soon

Time that I've taken
Pray is not wasted

Have I already tasted my piece of

One sweet love?
Ready and waiting
For a heart worth the breaking
I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of

One sweet love.
Savor the sorrow to soften the pain
Sip on the southern rain, as I do
I don't look don't touch don't do anything

But hope that there is a you.
The earth that is the space between
I'd banish it from under me... to get to you.
An unexpected love provides
My solitary's suicide... oh I wish I knew
Time that I've taken
Pray is not wasted
Have I already tasted my piece of
One sweet love?
Ready and waiting
For a heart worth the breaking
But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of
One sweet love.
One sweet love
