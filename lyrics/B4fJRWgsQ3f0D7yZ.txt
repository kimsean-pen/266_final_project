Cigarettes
And tiny liquor bottles
Just what you'd expect
Inside her new Balenciaga
Viral mess
Turned dreams into an empire
Self-made success now she rolls with Rockafellers

Survival of the richest
The city's ours until the fall
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound
But we don't feel like outsiders at all

We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

Young James Dean
Some say he looks just like his father
But he
Could never love somebody's daughter
Football team
Loved more than just the game
So he vowed to be
His husband at the altar

Survival of the richest
The city's ours until the fall
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound
But we don't feel like outsiders at all

We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

We know very well
Who we are
So we hold it down
When summer starts
What kind of dough
Have you been spending?
What kind of bubblegum
Have you been blowing lately?

We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana
