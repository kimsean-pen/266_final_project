Or you'll be leaving with a fat lip
It's all about the he-says, she-says bullshit

Feeling like a freight train
First one to complain
Leaves with a bloodstain
Damn right I'm a maniac

And then your stuck up
You just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away motherfucker
It's just one of those days
It's all about the he-says, she-says bullshit
I think you better quit, let the shit slip
Or you'll be leaving with a fat lip
