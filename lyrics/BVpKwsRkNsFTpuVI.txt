I'm spinning in circles by the street, out of light
With every excuse, I'm fallen behind
Now watch me self destruct, right on time
I built up every wall, I've had to climb

When real life ain't nothin', but anger and doubt
And failure's a stranger we all dream about

I hold it down
I hold it down
So tell my doubts I'm coming home
And put my failures on the phone
Hold it down, let it go

I gambled my soul without knowing the stakes
And now I'm filling a hole with falsehood and shame
And now my guilty skin will turn to stone
Lord, I'm a man of sin, now that I know

When real life ain't nothin' but anger and doubt
And failure's a stranger we all dream about
I hold it down
I hold it down

So tell my doubts I'm coming home
And put my failures on the phone

'Cause real life ain't nothing but anger and doubt
And failure's a stranger we've all dreamed about
I hold it down

I'm looking for answers, but lost in my head
Now I reach into darkness and take what I get
I hold it down

I hold it down
I hold it down
I hold it down
I hold it down

So tell my doubts I'm coming home
And put my failures on the phone
Hold it down, let it go
