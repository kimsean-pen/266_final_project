Devil, devil
clever devil devil
How quickly they do sell their souls
For the feast and the promise of gold
But devil that won't be me

Devil, devil
Bones of metal metal
You torture saints with a single glance
Make them think they ever stood a chance

Do not try me devil devil
Cannot buy me devil devil
You won't make a fool of me oh no
What makes you so special special
to think i would ever settle
For that devious dance between you and me devil devil

rebel rebel call me rebel rebel
i walk the plank, not a tear in my eye
i won't go down your blushing bride
Under the water i'll be sharpening my knife

do not try me devil devil
cannot buy me devil devil
You won't make a fool of me oh no
What makes you so special special
to think i would ever settle
For that devious dance between you and me devil devil

you take the shape of
everything that I'm drawn to
you take the shape of
everything that I'm drawn to
but your eyes
are dead and red
red as rust
Do not try me devil devil
Cannot buy me devil devil
You won't make a fool of me oh no
What makes you so special special
to think i would ever settle
For that devious dance between you and me devil devil
