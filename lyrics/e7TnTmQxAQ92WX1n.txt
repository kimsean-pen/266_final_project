I wear Gucci, I wear Bali at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time Aye

Gucci made in Italy, Bali belt I'm killing shyt,
Tha way I'm rocking Jimmy Choo, tha word got out I'm dealing it,
I fuck her she a immigrant, don't touch her she'n got benefits,
Bussing down them benjamins, fuck it up I'm rolling cakes,
Dats tha way I'm kicking it, Ferragamo cover me, Puerto Rican Japanese,
We laid up had a double tree, yellow ice a bumble bee,
Pinky ring a quater key, I-phone a metro twerking off tha whole thing,
My earring a jelly bean, gangsta lean an Irene, red eyes no visine,
I'm loc'd out on tha drink, horse shoes on my jeans,
Robin jeans wit tha Wings, yellow bone on my team,
Trafficking them ya-means, space boots wit tha Spikes,
Go to A-Z on tha flight, mail a hundred overnight, yea yea yea yea

I wear Gucci, I wear Bali at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time Aye
I'm in Phipps with the set going crazy
Got some diamonds round my neck no fugazay
Bad bitches in the suite, tryna to bait me
Just a young hood nigga, streets raised me
Working wit a unit, tryna stretch it to another one,
Drinking on that active, then it tasting like some bubble gum,
Thumbing through that check, born on a check
Talking on the iPhone, sipping out tha styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone, that money got my mind blown
Bbs and white stones, bbs and white stones
I'm rolling like a rolling stone
Free Benzel Al Capone
And my cash way long, turned up
I see a bunch of clones

I wear Gucci, I wear Bali at the same damn time
On the boat, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time Aye

Give me apartment and some water and I can swim
Got that Gambino jumping out tha chair
My young nigga serving J's outside crim
Jumping cross me you know your chances slim
In my aviator gucci like I'm driving planes,
When tha cash hit cash money smell like cocaine,
Doing Birdman numbers making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside tha jewler jumping bale on ya ring,
Spent so much on Louie gave me free champagne,
In bale harbor shopping in they doing tha same thing,
And I keep my cup wit me like a pimp,
I take a Magic Don Juan Jacob glimpse,
Spike Lee need to get this shit on film,

I wear Gucci, I wear Bali at the same damn time
On the boat, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time Aye
