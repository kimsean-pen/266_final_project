Did you're mom get back from her business trip?

Is she there or is she tryna' give me the slip?

You know I'm not the little boy, that I used to be
I'm all grown up now, baby can't you see!

Stacy's mom has it going on!
She's all I want and I've waited so long!
Stacy can't you see, you're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong
But I'm in love with Stacy's mom

Your mom came out with just a towel on
