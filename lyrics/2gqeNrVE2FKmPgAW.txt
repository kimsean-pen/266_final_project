You let me go, you had to have her
You told me slow, I died faster
Than I could know love would ever kill
You said take care, don't be sad, girl
Life's not fair, it's a mad world
But I'm not mad, am I to down that pill?

I'm alive, I think I'm gonna be okay (ooh ooh ooh)
I'm alright tonight
I'm alive, I think I'm gonna be okay (ooh ooh ooh)
I'm alright for now

I broke down (I broke down), all you did was stand there (you just stand there)
Without a sound (without a sound), it came from nowhere (it came from nowhere)
The truth's so loud (the truth's so loud), oh, my heart stood still
I was not your dream (I was not your dream), the one you wanted (the one you wanted)
I tried to scream (I tried to scream), but silence haunted (silence haunted)
Me in my sleep (me in my sleep), oh, and follow me, always will

I'm alive, I think I'm gonna be okay (ooh ooh ooh)
I'm alright tonight
Woh, I'm alive, I think I'm gonna be okay (ooh ooh ooh)
I'm alright for now

No one (no one) comes un- (comes un-)
Done the way I do when it comes to you
And who knows how close (how close)
I was to the end? But I got back up again
Oh, I'm still breathing

(I'm alright, oh, I'm gonna be okay)
I'ma, I'ma, I'm gonna be okay
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(I'm alright, oh, tonight)
I'ma, I'm alright

I'm gonna be, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma
(I'm alright)
I'm alright, I think I'm gonna be okay
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(I'm alright)
I'm alright tonight
(I'm alright)
Oh, I'm alive, I think I'm gonna be okay
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
I'm alright for now
