I'll light two cigarettes
Then I'll give you one
Oh that never gets old
No it never gets old

You send me your regrets
Look what you've done
Now you'lle never grow old
No you'll never grow old

These messages won't compute
Those images won't come through
No matter what you say
No matter what yoy do
Those images won't come through
These messages won't compute

Your love
Your love
Score love as a painkiller
Your love
Morelove
Pure love as a painkiller

Your love
is just
Your love is a painkiller
Sweet tasting overdose
Oxytocin
Oh I'll never be told
No I"ll never be told
