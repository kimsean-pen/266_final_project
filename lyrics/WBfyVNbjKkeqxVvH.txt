No no really, this one's on me
I'll let you get the next time
We go out for coffee
'Cause I wanna know
All about your history
Open my eyes
We can solve this mystery
Cause I've got all the clues
And I can't piece it together
Now I'm talking to you
So can ya clear up the record
Do you hear him?
Do you feel him?
Do you see him?
Do you see him when you're dreaming?
Does he hit you?
Does he hold you?
Does he listen?
Or cut you off when you're speaking?
'Cause I-I-I-I-I wanna know the reason
You're telling everyone he is your best friend
And you're handing out flyers
Flyers on the weekends
You're making up your mind
You say everything is blinded by history
So you stay at home writing
Unauthorized biographies
I get so confused
When you can't keep it together
Now I'm talking to you
So can you clear up the record?
Do you hear him?
Do you feel him?
Do you see him?
Do you see him when you're dreaming?
Does he hit you?
Does he hold you?
Does he listen?
Or cut you off when you're speaking?
'Cause I-I-I-I-I wanna know the reason
I-I-I-I-I wanna know the reason
I-I-I-I-I wanna know the reason
Do you hear him?
Do you feel him?
Do you see him?
Do you see him when you're dreaming?
Does he hit you?
Does he hold you?
Does he listen?
Or cut you off when you're speaking?
I wanna hear what you say
But you keep walking away
Everytime I say hey!
Do you hear him?
Do you feel him?
Do you see him?
Do you see him when you're dreaming?
I-I-I-I-I wanna know the reason
I-I-I-I-I wanna know the reason
