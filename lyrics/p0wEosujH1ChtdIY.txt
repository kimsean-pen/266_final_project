The darkness bleeds violent sights
It purges from within
Death, it holds you in it's arms
And kisses you goodnight
Oh, oh, oh, the darkness comes
Oh, oh, oh, I feel it's bite
Oh, it purges from within
It's over, it's over
This haunting, it's over
They cut my wrists, and watch me bleed
Inside a dream
And over, and over
This haunting, it's over
They cut my wrists and watch me bleed
They stop haunting me
The darkness bleeds violent sights
It purges from within
Death, it holds you in it's arms
And kisses you goodnight
Oh, oh, oh, the darkness comes
Oh, oh, oh, I feel it's bite
Oh, it purges from within
It's over, it's over
This haunting, it's over
They cut my wrists, and watch me bleed
Inside a dream
And over, and over
This haunting, it's over
They cut my wrists and watch me bleed
They stop haunting me
