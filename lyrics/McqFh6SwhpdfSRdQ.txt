We all gonna love the day
Gets stuck in the fade
I can see the sun is shining bright right on through the haze
I complain to say
Is this really my life
Now that i'm over you, and it's over too
I can finally feel alive
But I won't give you my heart, cause it don't break twice
Just to let you know, let you know
And if you play the part, and play it real nice
Baby I'll let go, I'll let go

I'm sure you'll tell me anything under the sun
Like how you think i'm special and the only one
Cause normally i'll probably just get up and run
But you looking so damn good to me under the sun
Under the sun...

Are we on the same page, don't need to play
All these games just to get a little feel of sunshine on my face
And I feel pain, today, is this really my life
Now that i'm over you, and it's over too
I can finally feel alive

But I won't give you my heart, cause it don't break twice
Just to let you know, let you know
And if you play the part, and play it real nice
Baby I'll let go, I'll let go

I'm sure you'll tell me anything under the sun
Like how you think i'm special and the only one
Cause normally i'll probably just get up and run
But you looking so damn good to me under the sun

Well do you get, do you get what I need, na na na
Could you show me that I want to see, na na na
And maybe you can get underneath, na na na
If you watch the sun go down on me, na na na
Go down on me!

I'm sure you'll tell me anything under the sun
Like how you think i'm special and the only one
Cause normally i'll probably just get up and run
But you looking so damn good to me under the sun
