What gets you high begging to try
Lick the edge of the bone dry
blowing kisses you can't miss it
money talks but you dont listen

Don't call it the easy way out
we know its all the same
theres always something else you wanna blame

How you gonna pretend
with the way that you've been
you never give it to your boyfriend
your busy hands gave a seedless lip
so he put stitches on your lip

While you fix your hair and your makeup
we notice the same thing
theres always something else you wanna blame

But honey how can you suppose
that anybody knows
your not a hussy anymore
you took the hand of an honest man
you tried to make him understand
your not a hussy anymore

What did you say
lets put it your way
you better give it to your boyfriend
blowing kisses he just misses
love is harder at a distance
don't call it the easy way out
we know its all the same
theres always something else you wanna blame

How can you suppose
that anybody knows
your not a hussy anymore

You took the hand of an honest man
you tried to make him understand
your not a hussy anymore.
