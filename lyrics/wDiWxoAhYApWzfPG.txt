I will take all
The blame this time
'Cause it was my fault
And you were kind

It's not hard searching for a reason
To believe that I'm something
'Cause I don't gamble like I used to
But I still do things that I shouldn't do
That I shouldn't do

It's on my mind
And it's on my mind

I will just leave
'Cause no more pain
'Cause I brought this on
And you were kind

'Cause now I'm searching for a reason
To believe that I'm something
'Cause I don't gamble like I used to
But I still do things that I shouldn't do
That I shouldn't do

It's on my mind
And it's on my mind

'N' you said to me
Can't we work it out?
Won't you talk to me?
What's this all about?

And you said to me
Can't we work it out?
Won't you talk to me?
What's this all about?

And you said to me
Can't we work it out?
Won't you talk to me?
What's this all about?

And you said to me
Can't we work it out?
Won't you talk to me?
What's this all about?
