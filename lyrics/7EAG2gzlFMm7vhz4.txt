He put sugar in his coffee
He stirred coffee with a teaspoon
He poured milk into sweetened coffee
He lifted the cup up to his lips
He drank coffee 'til was empty
He put cup back onto saucer
Without looking at me
He took cigarette from his packet
He lit cigarette with his matches
He blew smoke rings with the smoke
Without looking at me
Without talking to me
He put his hat onto his head
He put raincoat 'cos it was raining
Oh he did have no umbrella
And he left in the rain
Without looking at me
Without talking to me
Silently no looking at
Speaking leaving me
Without looking
Talking silently
No looking
Leaving without going
No looking at me no looking at me
No looking at me no looking at me
No no looking no no looking
No no looking at me...
