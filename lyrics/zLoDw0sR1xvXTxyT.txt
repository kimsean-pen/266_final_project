Someone will call
Somethin' will fall
And smash on the floor

Without readin' the text
Know what comes next
Seen it before and it's painful

Things must change
We must rearrange them
Or we'll have to estrange them

All that I'm sayin'
A game's not worth playin'
Over and over again

You're the one I like best
You retain my interest
You're the only one

If it wasn't for you
Don't know what I'd do
Unpredictable like the sun
And the rainfall

Things must change
We must rearrange them
Or we'll have to estrange them

All that I'm sayin'
A game's not worth playin'
Over and over again

Things must change
Things must change
Things must change
Things must change

If it wasn't for you
Don't know what I'd do
Unpredictable like the sun
(Things must change)

Someone will call
Somethin' will fall
And smash on the floor
(Things must change)

Without readin' the text
Know what comes next
Seen it before
(Things must change)

You're the one I like best
(All that I'm sayin')
(A game's not worth playin')
You retain my interest
(Over and over again)
You're the only one
(Things must change)

If it wasn't for you
(All that I'm sayin')
(A game's not worth playin')
Don't know what I'd do
(Over and over again)
Unpredictable like the sun
(Things must change)
