I was sitting at the mall with my friends on a Monday
Saying I was gonna leave this town
Leave this town, run away
But then you walked in and I think my heart don't skip a beat

One look and everything just froze

Like a rock rolling down a hill
Like a car with no one at the wheel
Take me to a doctor cause I'm shaking
I need water tell me do they have a pill
I'm feeling ill

It must be love, it must be love, it must be love
It must be love, it must be love, it must be love
It's in my heart, eh, it's in my body
It must be love

I've been working all day and night
Staying busy minding business
Ain't looking for trouble, got no man upon my wishlist
But now you're in my head
Get outta there get here instead

One smile and everything just froze

Like a rock rolling down a hill
Like a car with no one at the wheel
Take me to a doctor cause I'm shaking
I need water tell me do they have a pill
I'm feeling ill

It must be love, it must be love, it must be love
It must be love, it must be love, it must be love
It's in my heart, eh, it's in my body
It must be love

Starts up in my chest
Kicks out of my bones
Not ready for this
Was fine on my own
Flashes in my head and there must be something wrong
I don't know what you did
But I can't leave you alone

It must be love, it must be love

It must be love, it must be love, it must be love
It must be love, it must be love, it must be love
It's in my heart, eh, it's in my body
It must be love
