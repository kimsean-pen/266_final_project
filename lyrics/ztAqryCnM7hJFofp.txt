When you look into my eyes
You'll know there were better times
And ever somewhere lost inside you
there's a child that smiles
Even though i try, i really try about them
Brother knows, Brother know
There will never be another side

When you look into my eyes
There's no better place to hide
And Brother knows, brother know
You're somewhere deep inside
But I know that you can do it
Better than I ever would

Look into my eyes

NOWENA

JUMEA

The darkest hours will seem long
they will feel like for ever
then new light breaks into dawn

novena burns for my brothers at night
a flame that burns the bodies of light

brothers burn. I see the fire in their eyes.

the past is your now
the present now passed

now is the time

(everything awaits you and the light will let you)
