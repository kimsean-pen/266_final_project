You think that there's something wrong?
Maybe I stayed too long
Or maybe
You're just getting into me
Can't get to sleep again
Spending our lives away
But you don't know what you mean to me do ya?
do you wanna take me over?
Do ya, do ya?
I feel so alive
Feels like I'll live forever
I'm not afraid no more
I'm not afraid no more
I am so now here
Standing in a moment
Her love flows like a river
Until she says it's over
Come in you'll catch a cold
Maybe we're getting old
Or maybe we're just getting into it
When are you coming round?
We're going underground
We don't even know how we're doing it
Do ya?
Do you wanna make me over do ya? do ya?
I feel so alive
Feels like I'll live forever
I'm not afraid no more
I'm not afraid no more
I am so now here
Standing in a moment
Her love flows like a river
Until she says it's over
I've been losing myself here lately
Sorry lately
I feel so alive
I've been losing myself here
Feel alive
I've been losing myself here
So don't, so don't, go don't ever go away
Don't ever go away
So don't, so don't, go, don't ever go away
Come in you'll catch a cold
Maybe we're getting old
Or maybe we're just getting into it
