I wont't lose the light and the air
Troubles on my mind
Wait and when you come back you can hear the sound
Waves are still high on the ground

You can't easily watch the beach
Liquid on your mouth
Wait and when you come back you can hear the sound
You were the last of the town

I was dreaming of a place
Where my body swam into the sky
Dance and put your glitter once again
Time is ticking, leave the fake

All seems so
You'll look so far away
It's not easy to start
It's not easy to start again
All the drugs you sold
All the drugs you ate
Let me go to heaven
Let me go to say hello
