If you're crazy and you know it shoot yourself
If you're crazy and you know it shoot yourself
If you're crazy and you know it and the gun is cocked and loaded
If you're crazy and you know it shoot yourself
Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet, meet the bullet
Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet halfway
Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet, meet the bullet
Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet halfway
Fuck you! Cause if you have your way
You'd have me broken and exposed
You're such a [?]
But I know, I know, I know
Hide your place under your tongue
(No you won't hear what I say)
I will always hold the gun
The bullet's on the way
You and me (Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet, meet the bullet)
And a bullet (Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet halfway)
You and me (Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet, meet the bullet)
And a bullet (Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet halfway)
My patience is one bullet away
Your ignorance rips me limb from limb
The skin is toughened, to stretch and cover up the bones left to [?]
Hide your place under your tongue
(No you won't hear what I say)
I will always hold the gun
The bullet's on the way
The way, way
Death is the new love and dust is the new blood
Death is the new love and dust is the new blood
Death is the new love and dust is the new blood
Death is the new love and dust is the new blood
You and me, and the bullet
Hide your place under your tongue
(No you won't hear what I say)
I will always hold the gun
The bullet's on the way
Hide your place under your tongue
(No you won't hear what I say)
I will always hold the gun
The bullet's on the way
You and me (Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet, meet the bullet)
And a bullet (Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet halfway)
You and me (Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet, meet the bullet)
And a bullet (Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet halfway)
You and me (Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet, meet the bullet)
And a bullet (Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet halfway)
You and me (Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet, meet the bullet)
And a bullet (Gonna meet the bullet, meet the bullet halfway)
