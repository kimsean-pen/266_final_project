Out in the real world
You are waiting to take my hand
I'll be looking for answer
That leads me back

I've hidden wishes for so long
Buried deep inside
Keeping them secret from a world
That'll never realize
The way I dream

Puedo ver esos ríos de luz
Escapar de mi piel, hacia la fantasía

Out in the real world
You are waiting to take my hand
I'll be looking for answer
That leads me back

I lack the will to face my fears
I'm running from it all
And all the painful memories
They haunt me once again
I'm giving up...

Puedo ver esos ríos de luz
Escapar de mi piel, hacia la fantasía

Out in the real world
You are waiting to hear my call
Through a river of illusions
You saw me fall
Out in the real world
You are waiting to take my hand
I'll be looking for answer
That leads me back
Outside
Back in your arms

No matter how hard it may seem
we should never hide
the little things that make us real.
Show them who we truly are,
we will in time

(Out in the real world) Puedo ver
(You are waiting to hear my call) Esos ríos de luz
(Through a river of illusions) escapar de mi piel
(You saw me fall) Hasta la fantasía

(Out in the real world)
(You are waiting to take my hand) Hay en mí tanto temor
(I'll be looking for answer) Tanto mal
(That leads me back) Que ocultar
