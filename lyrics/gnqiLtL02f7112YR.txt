I've always dreamt of travel
Why should we die where we were born? (born)
Some roads are laid with gravel
Sometimes you gotta build your own (own)

I wanna tear down boundaries
I wanna greet my enemies
I wanna see what I haven't seen
'Cause I know there's more

I take the world by storm (storm x3)
I take the world by storm (storm x3)

I don't have any answers
The more I know the more I grow (grow)
I don't know where I'm going
But I'mma search 'cause I see hope (hope)

I wanna tear down boundaries
I wanna greet my enemies
I wanna see what I haven't seen
'Cause I know there's more

I take the world by storm (storm x3)
I take the world by storm (storm x3)

There's got to be more than this
Gotta figure out how to jump the wall
I wanna live and learn
Don't matter if I land or if I fall
I know when I return
At least I know I'll be walking tall
I'm not afraid

'Cause I take the world by storm (storm x3)
I take the world by storm (storm x3)
