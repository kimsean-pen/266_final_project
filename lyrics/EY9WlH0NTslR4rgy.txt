Her words ring true
her message clear
how can he hear through all the noise and dissonance?

I've seen a sign
that he can change
if given just a chance.

Against all hope
we found a way
and it is all because she trusted me.
Why have a gift
you can't embrace
when all you need is faith?

And there's a reason, now I see.
The reason I've been chosen
she sees the light inside of me
a reason to believe.

But I can't climb this mountain without you.
No, I can't face this on my own.
With you by my side, we will open his eyes
and the truth will deliver us home.

And there's a reason, now I see.
The path that he has chosen
he feels the light inside of me
in the absence of song
he's forgotten right from wrong.

Our voices will release him
he's refused to listen for too long
I'm convinced beyond a doubt
there can be no other way
he just has to hear me out
there's so much I need to say

But I can't climb this mountain without you.
No, I can't face this on my own.
With you by my side
we will open his eyes
and the truth will deliver us home.
