Sun down, Sun up
Sun down, Sun up

I speak in sarcasm to relate to all the things I appreciate
I lie in rhythm to open doors I follow suit and just want more
My reputation is the same its been and I don't care what happens
I read the book so I know the end

I've probably said too much
But I've never felt more accomplished

I'm losing sleep, I'm losing friends
I've got a love hate love with the city I'm in
I'll count the hours, having just one wish
If I'm doing fine there's no point to this

I'm losing sleep, I'm losing friends
I've got a love hate love with the city I'm in
I'll count the hours, having just one wish
If I'm doing fine there's no point to this

I'm losing sleep, I'm losing friends
I've got a love hate love with the city I'm in
I'll count the hours, having just one wish
If I'm doing fine there's no point to this
