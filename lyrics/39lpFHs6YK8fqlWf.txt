Got to let it show

There's a new me coming out
And I just had to live
And I wanna give
I'm completely positive
I think this time around
I am gonna do it
Like you never knew it
Oh, I'll make it through
The time has come for me

To break out of this shell
I have to shout
That I am coming out

I've got to show the world
All that I wanna be
And all my abilities
There's so much more to me
Somehow I'll have to make them
Just understand
I got it well in hand

And oh how I have planned
I'm spreadin' love
There is no need to fear
And I just feel so good
Every time I hear

I'm coming out
I want the world to know
I got to let it show
I'm coming out (coming)
I want the world to know (out)
I got to let it show
