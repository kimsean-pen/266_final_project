Baby, baby you're so cool
But, maybe, maybe thats not you
But, who cares? Do you care what they say?
And you swear, you swear you're no cliche
Cause you just do what you want and you act so nonchalant
I wish you would share with me everything that you're feeling
And you just hide it all inside
Show me, show me, show me the real you
I don't know why you just won't try
Show me, show me, show me the real you
Baby, baby you're a fool
But, maybe, but, maybe I'm like you
But, who cares? Do you care what they think?
And you swear, you swear you're just like me
Cause you just do what you want and you act so nonchalant
I wish you would share with me everything that you're feeling
And you just hide it all inside
Show me, show me, show me the real you
I don't know why you just won't try
Show me, show me, show me the real you
