I've arrived in the city where I'm gonna sing,
If I'm gonna sing, I must take a walk,
If I take a walk, I'm watching some people,
If I'm watching some people,
I think about youhuhu, yeah, yeah, yeah...
There's no one like youhuhu, yeah...

My grandma gave me this little guitar,
This little guitar has been quiet for a while,
If it's quiet for a while, it needs some new songs,
If it needs some new songs,
I think about youhuhu, oh yeah,
All I write about is youhuhu, yeah...

Ai, ai, ai, moreno,
Desse jeito você me ganha,
Esse teu chamego,
O meu dengo e a tua manha.
Ai, ai ai, moreno,
Tua pele não há quem negue,
Cor de quente, coração,
Toda estrela e sol te segue.

Só vou se for com ele,
Eu tenho medo de avião,
Se eu fico longe dele
Eu perco o norte e o chão.
Só quero saber dele
E nada mais importa.
Eu vou ficar com ele,
Que ele pega a minha mão
E nunca mais me solta.
