Oh my God, think I'm lost at sea
These silent waves are my company
And I lost the line between the sky and sea
And I'm wondering, "Will the wind ever come for me?"
Yeah

Cause I don't know, I don't know where I am
Can you tell me, will I break or will I bend?
Will the wind ever come again?
Ooh, ooh

I feel the sun coming out, rising from the east
And I see the empire, falling to her knees
And I lost the line between, her and me
My troubles are gone if the wind ever comes for me
Yeah

Cause I don't know, I don't know where I am
Can you tell me, will I break or will I bend?
Will the wind ever come?

I dreamed I found the shoreline
You were standing there
I dreamed I found you waiting
You were waiting for me, waiting for me

Tried to kiss the emptiness
Lost the line between sky and sea
I feel the sun coming up, coming up, coming up, coming up
And I don't know, I don't know where I am
I will break or I will bend
Will the wind ever come again?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
