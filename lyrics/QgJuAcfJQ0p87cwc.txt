Tell you 'bout a dream
That I have every night
Tell you 'bout a dream
That I have every night

It ain't Kodachrome and
It isn't black and white
Take me for a fool
If you feel that's right
Well, I'm never on my own
But there's nobody in sight

I don't know why
I'm scared of the lightning
Trying to reach me
I can't turn to the
Left or the right

I'm too scared to run
And I'm too weak to fight
But I don't care it's all
Psychobabble rap to me
Psychobabble

Tell you 'bout a dream
That I have every night
It's in Dolby stereo
But I never hear it right

Take me for a fool
Well, that's all right
Well, I see the way to go
But there isn't any light

I don't know why
I'm scared of the lightning
Trying to reach me
Help me to find
What I don't wanna know

You're taking me there
But I don't wanna go
I don't care it's all
Psychobabble rap to me

Psychobabble
All psychobabble
Psychobabble
All psychobabble

I don't care it's all
Psychobabble rap to me

You're readin' my mind
You won't look in my eyes
You say I do things
That I don't realize

But I don't care it's all
Psychobabble rap to me

Psychobabble
All psychobabble
Psychobabble
All psychobabble

You're lighting a scene
that's faded to black
I threw it away 'cause
I don't want it back
But I don't care it's all
Psychobabble rap
