In a city that lives while its bright stars die
And you start to get old when you turn 25
Where else can you go when you've got that drive?
And everybody says when they arrive

It's not so bad in L.A
The parking's cheap and valet
Those blue skies day after day
It's not so bad in L.A

Backyard got two lemon trees
Ten grams at the dispensary
Angels all left, but we'll stay
It's not so bad in L.A
Ay... la, la, la, la, la

And the ghosts of the nineties walk the streets
And the famous girls smile with the whites of their teeth
All licking their lips for a quick fifteen
Your appetite fades but you're still starving

It's not so bad in L.A
The parking's cheap and valet
Those blue skies day after day
It's not so bad in L.A

Backyard got two lemon trees
Ten grams at the dispensary
Angels all left, but we'll stay
It's not so bad in L.A

It's not so bad in L.A
The parking's cheap and valet
Those blue skies day after day
It's not so bad in L.A

Backyard got two lemon trees
Ten grams at the dispensary
Angels all left, but we'll stay
It's not so bad in L.A
Ay, ay, la, la, la, la, la, la...

Two lemon trees
Ten grams at the dispensary
Angels all left, but we'll stay
It's not so bad in L.A
