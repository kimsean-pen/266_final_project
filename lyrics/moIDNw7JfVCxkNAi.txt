I think that maybe if I can't explain
The in between
This and that, or the dimension after
Maybe on another plane
We never really met

Do you ever wander
Feelings ever fonder
Stuck inside a verb that's never resting
Boarding on another plane
I touched her in the terminal
Can't wait any longer
Flying on your miles

Victim
Victim
I'm a victim of
Victim

It seems that lately I've been slipping
A little more
In the shower holding on my razor
Careful where I'm stepping
Don't want the blood the let

This won't last forever
See I'm much to clever
To stay inside my lane when it's spiraling

Maybe it's a matter
You know I just can't feel no more
I'm a victim of
Victim
