I'm not a fantasy
I'm not some kind of Holy Ghost
I'm not a memory
You turn to when you need it most
I didn't promise I'd be perfect
Didn't promise that I would play the game
So let's be honest is this working, is this working
Would you hesitate
If I was to tell you

All I really need is not a happy ending
All I really need I want to stop pretending
That you treat me like a real girl
Isn't that what you're here for
That you treat me like a real girl
I want you tell me that I want more
That you treat me like a real girl

It's not a mystery
How long until you realize
When you stand in front of me
It's somnething you can't deny
Were you hoping I'd be flawless
Were you wishing on a movie star
Let's be open do you want it, do you want it
Would I get the part
If I was to tell you

All I really need is not a happy ending
All I really need I want to stop pretending
That you treat me like a real girl
Isn't that what you're here for
That you treat me like a real girl
I want you tell me that I want more
That you treat me like a real girl

I won't stop you if you chose that this girl is not for you
If I'm still not getting through then there's nothing I can do

All I really need is not a happy ending
All I really need I want to stop pretending
That you treat me like a real girl
Isn't that what you're here for
That you treat me like a real girl
I want you tell me that I want more
That you treat me like a real girl
All I really need is not a happy ending
All I really need I want to stop pretending
That you treat me like a real girl
Isn't that what you're here for
That you treat me like a real girl
I want you tell me that I want more
That you treat me like a real girl
That you treat me like a real girl
