Vedauwoo, Vedauwoo
Five weeks too full to see you
Canyons by the million, canyons by the million
Mountains blue
Five weeks too full to know you

Don't you know I love you?
Don't you know I love you?
It's further down, born before the ashes blocked the sun

Vedauwoo, Vedauwoo
Mind weak, words too soft to reach you
Mind weak, words too soft to reach you
