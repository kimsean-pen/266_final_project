When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

When the tears come streaming down your face
'Cause you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
What could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
I will try to fix you

Well high up above or down below
When you are too in love to let it show
Well but if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth
Oh

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

(Okay Walls!)

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Oh when tears stream down your face
And I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Oh when tears stream down your face
And I

(Lights will guide you home)
(And ignite your bones)
And I will try to fix you

(Merci beaucoup tout le monde)
(Thank you so much)
(Thank you, all right)
