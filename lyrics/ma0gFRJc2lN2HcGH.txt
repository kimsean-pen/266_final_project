Cold
Cold, as I already know
You won't be there
If I had seen that it wasn't a dream
Could you be here?
Baby, I'm blue
Don't tell me the truth
Tell me it's alright
Taking it slow, try not to call
Try not to care
I'm taking it slow
Try not to fall, try not to care

Don't look back
You've had enough of all my love
I guess it's just too bad
I'm moving on now
Ain't it sad?
Giving up now, giving up all our love
I guess it's just too bad
We're moving on now, somehow

Deep
Deep underwater I breathe
Let me soak
Choosing the shades of the love that we made
Of the love that we broke
Babe, it was blue
But I think that we knew it was gonna be alright
Now that you're near, I feel you still here
Oh, what a shame

Don't look back
You've had enough of all my love
I guess it's just too bad
I'm moving on now
Ain't it sad?
Giving up now, giving up all our love
I guess it's just too bad
We're moving on now, somehow

Typical that you call
Not my fault anymore
Typical, at the best of times every morning
Warning signs
Typical that you call
Not my fault anymore
And you know too well
That you call at the best of times
Every morning when you want me

But you claim not to claim
To say and to say
But nothing wears you off
Just too sad, it's too sad
What we had was too bad
And it's gone away, you know

But you claim not to claim
To say and to say
But nothing wears you off
Just too sad, it's too sad
What we had was too bad
And it's gone away, you know

But you claim not to claim
To say and to say
But nothing wears you off
Just too sad, it's too sad
What we had was too bad
And it's gone away, you know
