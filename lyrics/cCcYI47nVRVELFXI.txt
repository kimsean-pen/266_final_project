Satan's Boundaries Unchained
Satan's Boundaries Unchained!

Skull crushing demons
Storming the earth

Blasphemic Carnage
Ruler of hell
Control my mind to succeed

Breaking the line of the sacred world
Invading valleys and woods
Crushing the faith of the scared world
Burning churches and fields

Conquering ancient cities
Glory and honour shall rise
Treading the path of fortune
Satan"s Boundaries Unchained

Creation of evil, come take control
Lead me in battle of my body and soul
Black magic force conquers my mind
Satan's Boundaries Unchained

Satan's Boundaries Unchained

Abuse my power
Proclamation of war
Infecting the innocent race

Satan my master
Rise from your throne
Your boundaries are unchained

Demons and beasts
Crossing the land
The path is prepared
Follow the horde into the night

Conquer the world
The borders are banned
Spread out your spell
Satan's Boundaries are Unchained
