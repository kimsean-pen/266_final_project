Tripping on words that I didn't say
Getting so lost in my head games
Making me feel kinda cold inside
I feel like leaving and I don't know why

When you're around
I go crazy
Let my hair down
Call me a fool
I get a little broken over you
I get a little broken over you

Trying so hard that I can't speak
I feel a little scared this time around
I don't really care when I hear your words
Sounds so sweet that it kind of burns

When you're around
I go crazy
Let my hair down
Call me a fool
I get a little broken over you
I get a little broken over you

Tell me how you feel when you see me
Does it feel real in the right way
Is it like love when you look inside
Even if its not then I wish you'd lie

When you're around
I go crazy
I let my hair down
Call me a fool
I get a little broken over you
I get a little broken over you
I get a little broken over you
