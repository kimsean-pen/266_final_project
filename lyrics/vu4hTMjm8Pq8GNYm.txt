There's nothing left of you
so when I left the loop,
what were you trying to prove?
You're skin and bones crumbling
But now the cloud are parting

With blue skies and endless heights,
so just fill your lungs and breathe

Slow it down, just wait
Take some time to question life
while you're young and learning
Take it slow, just stay
I know it's hard but moving fast,
you're going to miss the journey

Death embrace me, Izanami take me
Life embrace me, Izanagi take me home

Take me home
The earth is coming to life again

With blue skies and endless heights,
so face east to the sunrise
This is my resting place, inside my mind
you know it's fine to take your time,
so just fill your lungs and breathe

Slow it down, just wait
Take some time to question life
while you're young and learning
Take it slow, just stay
I know it's hard but moving fast,
you're going to miss the journey

Death embrace me, Izanami take me
Life embrace me, Izanagi take me home

You're skin and bones and crumbling
Just know your clock is ticking, It's moving so fast,
and all the clouds are parting, It's beaming with light,
so take my hand and trust me,
because we are going to see the sunrise
If it's the last thing we do tonight
