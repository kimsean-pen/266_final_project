When the room don't like us
I'll be at your table
Yeah I'll be sitting next to you
And when the world ain't righteous
It's raining Cain and Abels
I'll be trying to dance with you
Oh everybody feels alive
So just one more time before the morning comes
Oh everybody feels alive
If they're throwing stones at the two of us, two of us

Everyone they say we don't work
But I could swear this is heaven yeah
Everyday I know that this might hurt but I don't care
This is heaven yeah

I couldn't stop couldn't fight this
I didn't come here to change up
Yeah I just want to fan your flame
Well if the young Picasso and the guy that made you
And no one's gonna bring you change
Oh everybody showing the scars
Patchwork hearts lighting up the dark
Love the dark oh yeah

Everyone they say we don't work
But I could swear this is heaven yeah
Everyday I know that this might hurt but I don't care
This is heaven yeah
This is heaven yeah

Oh you don't feel alive now
You say you don't feel alive now
You're looking for heaven yeah
Oh you don't feel alive now
Say you don't feel alive now
You're looking for heaven

Everyone they say that this don't work
But I could swear this is heaven yeah
Everyday I know that this might hurt but I don't care
This is heaven yeah
This is heaven yeah
This is heaven yeah
