I got an up close glimpse of the outside world
It's an awful big place, well that's for damn sure
Seen more of this life than most have seen
And it's taken a mighty be toll on me
Ah it'd sure feel good to be free

Some days I feel alright
Some days I can't wait until it's night
Sometimes you gotta face that light
Get back in the ring, put on your gloves and fight
I think it's gonna take some time
To find a way to ease my mind
It's gonna take the long way back home
So I'm gonna take the long way back home
Back home

Did you ever see a man have a heart attack
It'll open your eyes and stop you in your tracks
So I threw away my last cigarette
Get it right this time, I'll clean up my act
That's a hard cold fact

Some days I feel alright
Some days I can't wait until it's night
Some days you gotta face that light
Get back in the ring, put on your gloves and fight
I think it's gonna take some time
To find a way to ease my mind
I'm gonna take the long way back home
I'm gonna take the long way back home
Oh back home

So many things I ain't done yet
So many things I've done that I'd forget
I just need a place to rest my head

Some days I feel alright
Some days I can't wait until it's night
Some days you gotta face that light
Get back in the ring, put on your gloves and fight
I think it's gonna take some time
To find a way to ease my mind
I'm gonna take the long way back home

Some days I feel alright
Some days I can't wait until it's night
Some days you gotta face that light
Get back in the ring, put on your gloves and fight
I think it's gonna take some time
To find a way to ease my mind
I'm gonna take the long way back home
So I'm gonna take the long way back home
So I'm gonna take the long way back home
So I'm gonna take the long way back home
Back home
