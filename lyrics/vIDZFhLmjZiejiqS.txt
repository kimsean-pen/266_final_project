Honey, I've waited so long for you
I wanna waste, waste away with you
We're moving slow with glitter on our face
I gotta stay, gotta stay in this place

This night is electric
And I won't forget it
You're so heavenly
You're so heavenly
But don't you know it
Don't you know it, baby?

We can dance forever and pretend
I wanna, I wanna stay 'til the end
We can dance forever and pretend
I wanna, I wanna stay 'til the end

Oh, nothing can feel this good
We're getting wasted on what we love
Be the dream, be the dream in my mind
Stay here wasting my time

This night is electric
And I won't forget it
You're so heavenly
You're so heavenly
But don't you know it, don't you know it, baby?

We can dance forever and pretend
I wanna, I wanna stay 'til the end
We can dance forever and pretend
I wanna, I wanna stay 'til the end

I'm not staying home, I'm not staying
You're so heavenly
You're so heavenly
I'm not staying home, I'm not staying
You're so heavenly
You're so

We can dance forever and pretend
I wanna, I wanna stay 'til the end
We can dance forever and pretend
I wanna, I wanna stay 'til the end

I'm not staying home, I'm not staying
You're so heavenly
You're so heavenly
I'm not staying home, I'm not staying
You're so heavenly
You're so
