I wanna see you move

Oh, baby, baby
Do you like it?
Oh, baby, baby, huh?
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Huh, yeah
My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Crazy!
You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited
I'm in too deep
Whoa oh, crazy
But it feels all right
Baby, thinking of you
Keeps me up all night

Get it, get it, get it
Uh, uh, uh

I'm a, slave for you
I can not hold it
I can not control it
I'm a, slave for you
I won't deny it
I'm not trying to hide it
Yeah! Baby, baby

Oh, baby, baby, oh, baby, baby

Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops Oops

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby, oops, you think I'm in love
Rhat I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent (Innocent, innocent, innocent)

But now, I'm stronger than yesterday Now, it's nothing, but-a my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I am stronger

Stop!

Yeah, like that?

Everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small, I guess I need you, baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face
It's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby, need you, baby, need you
Baby, need you, baby

I wanna see you move
Move...

With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With the taste of a poison paradise, I'm addicted to you
Don't you know
That you're toxic? And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're
Toxic?
