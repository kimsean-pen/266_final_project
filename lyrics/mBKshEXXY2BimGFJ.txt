Does it matter how we turn on the light?
Baby, let's turn on the light
I wasn't dreaming about anything
But was afraid that I might
We always slip so far apart
And every time we do it really breaks my heart
What does it matter how we turn on the light?
Baby, let's turn off the dark

Every time we see an empty space
Could be looking in a mirror to see my face
All the pieces just fall to pieces
Like ice in the Saturday sun
We always slip so far apart
And every time we do you know it breaks my heart

What does it matter how we turn on the light?
Baby, let's turn off the dark!
What does it matter how we turn on the light?
Baby, let's turn on the light!
What does it matter how we turn on the light?
Baby, let's turn on the light!
What does it matter how we turn on the light?
Baby let's turn on the light!
What does it matter how we turn on the light?
Baby let's turn on the light!
