Hey little mama,
Ain't gotta ask me if I want to
Just tell me can I get a light
Roll you up and let it run through my veins

Cause I can always see the furthest stars
When I'm on you

And I don't wanna ever come down
Off this cloud of loving you
Now you got me hopped up on that

(Pusher love)
So high I'm on the ceiling baby

(You're my drug)

So go on and be my dealer babe
(Roll me up)
Cause all I want is you babe, yeah
One more time

And I know that your supply
Won't run out anytime soon
Cause you gave me a taste
Now I know that there's no getting off you
And I don't wanna ever come down off this cloud of lovin' you

And I don't wanna come down
From this love I got on high

Now I'm just a (J-j-j-junkie for your love)
I'm hopped upon it
(Pusher love)
Now I'm just a (J-j-j-junkie for your love)
Break it down
My heroine,
My cocaine
My plum wine,
My MDMA
I'm hopped upon it
It won't go away
Now I can't wait 'til I get home
And get you in my vein
(Pusher love)
I'm just a (J-j-j-junkie for your love)
Hopped upon it
And now I'm just a (J-j-j-junkie for your love) (Pusher love)

I'm hopped upon it
And now I'm just a (J-j-j-junkie for your love) My nicotine,
My blue drink
My hydroplonic,
My candy jelly bean
Can't you fix me up,
I'm your number one fan
Be my little pill
And just creep into my blood stream
Bloodshot eyes,
I'm hopped upon it
You ain't gotta think twice
Just hop upon it
There's a million names for your kind of chronic
Huh,
That pusher love
That's what I call it
(Pusher love)
I'm just a (J-j-j-junkie for your love)
I'm hopped upon it
Now I'm just a (J-j-j-junkie for your love)
Let me hear you say
(Pusher love)
Now I'm just a (J-j-j-junkie for your love)
I'm hopped upon it
Yeah!
And now I'm just a (J-j-j-junkie for your love)
(Pusher love)
(Pusher love)
