Tired of this endless motion sickness.
Feeling dizzy and drunk.
From this madness, from this madness.
Paralyzed and breathless, I'm staring into emptiness
I see my dreams disappear through my fingers.

Sinking like a rock, in this lake of mud!
This crown is to–æ heavy, I need to take it off!

Serendipity tree is dying from thirst.
My lips are cold, covered in dust.
Tired of being silent, tired of being lost.
There is only one trail I can truly trust.

I can't hide from my past, but I'll change what I'll become.
I just need to find what will make my flowers bloom.
Unbind my chest from the rough, harsh leather.
I'll find my way out to hover like a feather.

The trail I chose, nobody is in
I am alone, fear under my skin!
In this ocean of sharks, I'm learning how to swim,
In this piercing silence, I'm learning how to scream,
In this ocean of sharks, I'm learning how to swim,
I'm learning how to scream.
