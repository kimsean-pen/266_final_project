I'm way too tired to be lonely
I spend my days as an only
I want to be saved but I just don't know
Alone we've got nothing or haven't you heard?

I guess, we're just two wounded birds
Now you're here and we're alone
We still don't know what it takes
(Oh, yeah)

We want to feel love
(We want, we want to feel it)
But we're just so scared
Alone we've got nothing or haven't you heard?

I guess, we're just two wounded birds
I get so high
You give me shelter, I guess, I'm alive
I get so high

You give me shelter to get through the night
Alone we've got nothing but haven't you heard?
I guess we're just two wounded birds
I'm way too tired to be lonely
You give me shelter to get through the night
