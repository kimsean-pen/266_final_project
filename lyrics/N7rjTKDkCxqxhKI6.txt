The sun came up today and it burned my blues away
The sun came up today and it burned my blues away
Go ahead if you have to leave me
You ain't coming back this time, nope that's fine

Got my sunshine I'll get by
Got my sunshine I'll get by
Got my sunshine I'll get by

The wind rose up today & it blew my blues blues away
The wind rose up today & it blew my blues blues away
Go ahead if you have to leave me
You ain't coming back this time, nop that's fine

Got my sunshine I'll get by
Got my sunshine I'll get by
Got my sunshine I'll get by
Lalalasoooooo

Fly take your things & Fly got my sunshine
I'll get by
Got my sunshine, Got my sunshine
Got my sunshine
