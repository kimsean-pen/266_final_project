Years kept passing by
Still my mind hasn't forgotten
Corpses lying among debris
Unrecognizable, rotten

Suffering from a trauma
it keeps hunting me

Considering me an obsessional
But they will never know
The massacres in former days
Hatred won't let go

Nightmares controlling my life
In my own world I live
suffer day and night
I face pain I don't want to see
Makes me realize
it won't leave me
Horrible events pass me by
I wake from my cry
in the midle of the night
I find myself shuddering in sweat
Memories of sorrow and death

Trauma
Trauma

Bodies filled with lead
They all have met an untimely death
Blood was everywhere
They lived in chaos and despair
