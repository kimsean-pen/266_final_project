I wrote a brand new song today
It's got every little thing I need to say
Had it so long on the tip of my tongue
All these words left unsung
May not hear it on MTV
No big deal, fine by me
As long as you know I'm starting now
To see what you see

You take away my insecurities
You make a day go by just like the breeze
I must confess the mess I may reveal
I'm half the man that you make me feel

You know how to find the best in me
You keep bringing out the best in me
You know how to find the best
So much better than the rest
Just keep bringing out the best in me

If somebody wants to hold my hand
There's very few things that I demand
But the one thing you should know
Just let me be or let me go
I had every chance to walk way
From this needle in the hay
Just turn around and let me say it to your face

You take away my insecurities
You make a day go by just like the breeze
I must confess this happiness I feel
I find it hard to believe it's real

You know how to find the best in me
You keep bringing out the best in me
You know how to find the best
So much better than the rest
Just keep bringing out the best in me

You take what's good and make it better in me
You know how to find the best
Just keep bringing out the best in me
(You take what's good and make it better in me)
You know how to find the best
Just keep bringing out the best in me
(You take what's good and make it better in me)
You know how to find the best
Just keep bringing out the best in me
You know how to find the best
Just keep bringing out the best in me

You take away my insecurities
You make a day go by just like the breeze
I must confess the mess I may reveal
I'm half the man that you make me feel

You know how to find the best in me
You keep bringing out the best in me
You know how to find the best
So much better than the rest
Just keep bringing out the best in me
