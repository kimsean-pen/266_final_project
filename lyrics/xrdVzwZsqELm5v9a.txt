Saying oh yeah, under your skill
You don't love me no ...
Rips my heart, rips my heart to bleed
No one that makes you see what life can see
And that's ...place
I'll see away your dreams

So they party, again...
Save my soul, I am
Rips my heart, rips my heart to bleed
No one that makes you see what life can see
And that's ... place
I'll fade away your dreams

Chasing my mind, forever, forever
Chasing my mind, forever, forever
Chasing my mind, forever, forever
Chasing my mind, forever, forever
Chasing my mind, forever, forever
You'll be chasing my mind, forever.
