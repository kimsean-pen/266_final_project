I walk along those city streets
You used to walk along with me
And every step I take recalls
How much in love we used to be

How can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
Whoa-ooo-ohhh-oh

When shadows fall I pass a small cafe where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight
How can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me?
When there is always something there to remind me

I was born to love you
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
Whoa-ooo-ohhh-oh
Whoa-oh-ooo-ohhh

If you should find you miss
The sweet and tender love
We used to share
Just go back to the places
Where we used to go
And I'll be there

How can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me?
And there is always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
And there is (And there is)
And there is
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me
(Always something there to remind me)
Always something there to remind me
(Always something there to remind me)
Always something there to remind me
(Always something there to remind me)
Always something there to remind me
