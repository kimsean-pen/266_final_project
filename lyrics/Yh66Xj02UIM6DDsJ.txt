All of my life, I hated you so
Wish every day you would die
Damn you in death, cursing the soul
No place for you waits by his side

Eye for an eye, your relation unknown
A memory no longer mine
Gone to the light and I'm glad that you died
Compliments of Christ

Suffer in his lie
Grace of god denied
Never rest in peace
For eternity

Favor the one, I despise and detest
Discard from your meaningless lives
Even in death you will never know me
Ill will will be all that you find

Spit on your grave and your name I'll disgrace
Your misery bleeding you dry
Sadness and sorrow for you ever more
Compliments of Christ

I am the darkness that steals your last breath
The hurt that brings tears to your eyes
Failed to be blessed, left unconfessed
To hell till the end of all time

Pain and misfortune construe and bestow
Sustain from the wonder of why
Now and forever alone in your spite
Wait your turn to die

Compliments of Christ
Hide behind his lies
Never will I grieve
You are dead to me
