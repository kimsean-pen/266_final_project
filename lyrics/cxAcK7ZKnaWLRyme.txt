So long, so long good times
Won't be hard to find
No pity is worse than my own
Chemistry is untold

So long good times (I'm on my own now)
I won't be hard to find (Here on my own)
No pity is worse than my own (I'm on my own now)
Chemistry is untold (Here on my own)

And quit saying there's nothing wrong
In my desert he won't grow
In my desert he won't grow

To this day I have been hunting for prey
But no catch won't seem to stay (Catch won't seem to)
But no catch won't seem to stay (Catch won't seem to stay)

Your soft spoken punch lines (I'm on my own)
Like an avalanche of hard rhyme (Here on my own)
Heading for my monsoon (I'm on my own now)
Thawing is overdue
