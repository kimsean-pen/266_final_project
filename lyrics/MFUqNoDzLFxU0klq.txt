I've been phoning
At night and morning
I heard you say
Tell him I'm not home
Now you're confessin'
But I'm still guessin'
I've been your fool
For so, so long
Girl don't lie
Just to save my feelings
Girl don't cry
And tell me nothin's wrong
Girl don't try
To make up phony reasons
I'd rather leave
Than never believe
If this is it
Please let me know
If this ain't love
You'd better let me go
If this is it
I want to know
If this ain't love, baby
Just say so
You've been thinkin'
And I been drinkin'
We both know that it's
Just not right
Now you're pretendin'
That it's not endin'
You'll say anything
To avoid a fight
Girl don't lie
And tell me that you need me
Girl don't cry
And tell me nothin's wrong
I'll be all right
One way or another
So let me go
Or make we want to stay
If this is it
Please let me know
If this ain't love
You'd better let me go
If this is it
I want to know
If this ain't love, baby
Just say so

If this is it
Please let me know
If this ain't love
You'd better let me go
If this is it
I want to know
If this ain't love, baby
Just say so
(If this is it)
(Please let me know)
I wanna know
(If this is it) If this is it
(Please let me know)
I gotta know
(If this is it)
You better let me know
Just say so
(If this is it)
(Please let me know)
(If this is it)
(Please let me know)
(If this is it)
