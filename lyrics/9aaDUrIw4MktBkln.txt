No one ever talked to me
Now I've forgotten how to speak
A problem with my chemistry
Now I cant sleep and I won't, eat
As soft as a strangers hand
I counted every grain of sand
I walked every inch of land, I know

So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know

No one ever walked with me
I got so tired on my feet
I lay drunk on the bowery
Time never meant much to me
As soft as a strangers hand
I counted every grain of sand
I walked every inch of land, I know

So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know
