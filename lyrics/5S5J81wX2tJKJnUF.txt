Told that nigga shoot the one,
It was not for fun
Ayy, yeah, yeah
Ayy, ayy

Only bad hoes in my mansion huh
My diamonds dancing
Catch a body like Charles Manson, huh
Watch them all panic
I just grind and do the damage, huh
My bitch Atlantic
Fuck her good, make me a sandwich, huh
Now she romantic
Where you at when we was broke?
You didn't trap with us
Nigga asked why he got slapped
'Cause he was actin' up
Ain't want that bitch, boy, you can have her
She was trash as fuck
You want some smoke then wear a vest
My niggas ready to bust

i8, doors up, I pull up, making a scene
All these bitches all on me
You know I'm dripped to the T
Pretty nigga, pretty bitch, we don't speak brokanese
Good weed, bad women, live my life like a king
That's right, give me head like lice
Skinny ting, nice ass, she gon' ride it like a bike
I don't ride no waves, pussy niggas like mice
Ball hard like Mike, top floor a perfect height

Only bad hoes in my mansion huh
My diamonds dancing
Catch a body like Charles Manson, huh
Watch them all panic
I just grind and do the damage, huh
My bitch Atlantic
Fuck her good, make me a sandwich, huh
Now she romantic
Where you at when we was broke?
You didn't trap with us
Nigga asked why he got slapped
'Cause he was actin' up
Ain't want that bitch, boy, you can have her
She was trash as fuck
You want some smoke then wear a vest
My niggas ready to bust

Ayy, they tried to stop my shine
But I stayed on my grind
I always thought ahead of them
That's why they all behind
My soda full of medicine
It get me through the night
Bitch, I'm only on my prime,
Got thirty Hennys, number nines
Drop top coupe, no roof
Fall in love not what we do
We just smash and move
Shawty like me, I got juice, ballin' like I hoop
I love my brother, that's my troop
For them, I would shoot

Only bad hoes in my mansion huh
My diamonds dancing
Catch a body like Charles Manson, huh
Watch them all panic
I just grind and do the damage, huh
My bitch Atlantic
Fuck her good, make me a sandwich, huh
Now she romantic

Damn, my niggas ready to bust, damn
