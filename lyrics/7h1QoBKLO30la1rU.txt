There's an alternate meaning behind the words you spoke
I can hear that now
Well I know he wants you back but I don't wanna let you go
Can you feel that?
It's tight enough to choke
How could you say a thing like that?
How could you say a thing like that?
I look to your face and see
it's telling me there's no retort
and the things I thought are coming true due to your cruel ways
Now we sleep in separate rooms
I talk to walls instead of you
Can you hear me? No?
I'm combining luck and chance
hoping for you sideways glance so I can see you
You laugh but there's no joke
How could you say a thing like that?
How could you say a thing like that?
I look to your face and see
it's telling me there's no retort
and the things i thought are coming true due to your cruel ways
