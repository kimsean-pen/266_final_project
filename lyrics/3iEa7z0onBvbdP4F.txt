I need the summer so bad or the windows down
On the ride home even though it's cold out

I need to cut my hair I need to make new friends
I need to lie about the things that make me who I am

I need my skin burned red I don't care how it hurts
I need to cut the sleeves off all of my old t-shirts

Her boyfriend says pretend that it's clean
Forget what they say and buy what you need
Cause money makes money it will make sense when you're older
Your hands are so cold, I wish the winter was over

I wish the winter was over

Let's put the number one thing in the number one spot
How rich are your parents? How much money do they got?

If it's the second or third time it doesn't even count
Shouldn't have taken you that long to figure this out

I watch the sun slide along the sky
The longer it takes the more I feel alive

Her boyfriend says pretend that it's clean
Forget what they say and buy what you need
Cause money makes money it will make sense when you're older
Your hands are so cold, I wish the winter was over

I wish the winter was over

There's notes at the crime scene
"Dear policemen, you can call me God."
Wealthy prep school scholarship kid
It doesn't make sense
No it doesn't make any sense at all
To anyone other than the person you're talking to

Her boyfriend says pretend that it's clean
Forget what they say and buy what you need
Cause money makes money it will make sense when you're older
Your hands are so cold, I wish the winter was over

I wish the winter was over
