I'll write this song
'Cause I can't find the words to say
To your face
I'm all alone
And its February (the) fourteenth
And I'm sitting by the phone
Replaying the dial tone
And I'm alone
And I don't wanna feel so sad

No roses at the door
Ain't got nobody to lie next to in the February cold
Replaying the dial tone
And I'm alone
And I don't wanna feel so sad
