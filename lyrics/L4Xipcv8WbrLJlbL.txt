I am the center of the universe
I'm the lives I didn't lead
I'm a church without the windows
And you'll never get to leave

Under my watch
Can you see it?

I am the center of the universe
You don't speak until I speak
There's a wall of sound around us
Can you hear me pray to me?

No, I've never done anything wrong to you
But I could, and I would, and I should
It's true
Light of a nebula
Light of the sea
Thanks for the offer, but
There's nothing I need
