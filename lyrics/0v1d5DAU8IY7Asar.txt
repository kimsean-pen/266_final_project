Manic depression is touching my soul
I know what I want but I just don't know how to, go about getting it
Feeling, sweet feeling drops from my fingers, fingers
Manic depression is catching my soul, yeah

Woman so weary, the sweet cause in vain
You make love, you break love, It's all the same when it's, when it's over
Music sweet music, I wish I could caress, caress, caress
Manic depression is a frustrating mess

Well, I think I'll go turn myself off and, uh, go on down, all the way down
Really ain't no use in me hanging around in your kinda scene
Music, sweet music, I wish I could caress, and a kiss, kiss
Manic depression is a frustrating mess

Sweet music, sweet music
Sweet music, sweet music
