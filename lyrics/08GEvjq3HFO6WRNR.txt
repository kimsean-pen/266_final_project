After all we've done to our faces and our fingers
You can run but you can't hide from this
Some would gasp some would cry as they wheeled us in by gurney
And we laugh about the time we fell

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I'm feeling so alone
There's writing on the ceiling that only I can see
And other times I feel like running home
'Cause the time we have is really not so bad
Despite the reservations that you had
I don't care at all, I'm really not so sad
Despite the observation that you had

'Cause I met a guy in Cleveland, he said it's not so bad
And other times you feel you wake up dead
And if you get the feeling you're watching after me
Well here's a clue, it's all just in my head

'Cause the time we have is really not so bad
Despite the reservations that you had
And I don't give a fuck, it's really not so sad
Despite the observation that you had

These darker days will never get me down
Gotta break, wipe that smile right off your face

We got the right to anything we want
Even if they beat you, no I can't behave
You're nothing, but, not for anything at all
Even if they kick you when you'reâ€“
I don't care

'Cause the time we have is really not so sad
Despite the reservations that you had
I don't care at all, I'm really not so sad
Despite the observation that you-
I don't care at all
