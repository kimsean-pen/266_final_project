It's so hard to let go
You can hear me but I'm invisible
But if you dig out your eyes, maybe pain will subside
The worst that could happen is you never see me again
But the worst is yet to come, my friend

This path I walk is comforting
But now I'm left to sing this song alone
I'm fading faster now

I left so long ago
You never noticed I was gone
Now that you don't have eyes, maybe now you'll realize
Within your own head, you're creating these lies
For what it's worth, you're still beautiful
But beauty lies within the eyes

This path I walk is comforting
But now I'm left to sing this song alone
I'm fading faster now
It's time to walk away with nothing left
Nothing left in my soul
I'm fading into myself

This path I walk is comforting
But now I'm left to sing this song alone
I'm fading faster now
It's time to walk away with nothing left
Nothing left in my soul
I'm fading faster now
