Oh, It started long ago
With Jesus and the Pharisees
Straw, will spin to solid gold
Foretold in all the prophecies
You cant stop this
Try to top this
Will come to be revered
And feard through out the galaxiy
A symbol of age and wisdome
The beard has long been dominated by the male of the species
But we welcom a new age
Where it's power can be weilded by the masculine or the feminine
The Power Of The
Glory To The
Blessed be the
Oh, its taking all control
This feelings got a hold on me
So wide, this freedom in my mind
This all consuming Exstacy
Come and take me
Scratch and scrape me
May it never be sheered
Posess me for eternity
Now is the moment we come together as one
Once fagmented we stand united
From the soil of our fears from the fruits of our enlightenment
Through our darkest opression we find our ultimate liberation
The Power Of The
Glory To The
Blessed be the
