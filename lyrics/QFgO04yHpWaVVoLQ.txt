I'm the living result
Of a man who's been hurt a little too much
And I've tasted, the bitterness of my own tears
Sadness is all my lonely heart can feel

I can't stand up from falling down
I can't stand up from falling down

Simple though love is still it confused me
Why I'm not loved the way I should be
Now I've lived with heartaches and I've roomed with fear
I've dealt with despair and I've wrestled with tears

I can't stand up from falling down
I can't stand up from falling down

The vow that we made
You broke it in two
But that don't stop me
From loving you

I can't stand up from falling down
I can't stand up from falling down, oh
