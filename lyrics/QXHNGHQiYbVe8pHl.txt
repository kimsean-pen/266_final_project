I feel right at home
A python all along
I've been searching for somewhere safe and warm
Devour you like my prey 'till you're quivering
Don't be afraid

Demonstrate, yeah, let's drop it
Yeah, I need a cave to hide in
Educate, I'm with the logic
I'm feeling swell (swell)
I'm feeling swell (swell)
C'mon, baby, summer rain on me, yeah
I'll let you reign over me, oh
You rain on me, yeah!
I'll let you reign over me, me, oh!

With you, I'm wrapped around up tight
I feel like I might take a bite

I'm so hypnotized
A python all along
I've been searching for somewhere safe to explore
Devouring you like my prey till you're shivering
Don't be afraid

I'll demonstrate, yeah, let's drop it
Yeah, I need a cave to hide in
Educate, I'm with the logic
I'm feeling swell (swell)
I'm feeling swell (swell)
Summer rain on me, yeah
I'll let you reign over me, me
Summer rain over me
Ooh baby, reign over me, yeah

Let me wrap you up in my love (let me wrap you up)
Yeah, grip tight I can't get enough, yeah
Grip tight I can't get enough
Ooh won't you let me wrap you up in my love, oh
Yeah, grip tight I can't get enough
Grip tight I can't get enough, oh

Baby, summer rain over me, yeah
You reign over me, oh
You rain on me, yeah!
(Let me wrap you up in my love)
Can you reign over me
(Grip tight I can't get enough
Grip tight I can't get enough)

Ooh let me wrap you up in my love
