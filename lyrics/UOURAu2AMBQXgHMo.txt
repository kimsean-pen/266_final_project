I want you to freak me through the night until the morn'
And it's the way your body boom booms through the night
Boom boom, I want you to freak

You steal my attention with one look in my direction
Obsession, you got me
I can't quit, you're my addiction
Keep doing what you're doing, don't stop
Tell me you can read my bad thoughts
Get closer and listen
Electric in this position

I can't help how much our bodies get along
I like you pushin' up on me, touching me

I want you to freak me through the night until the morn'
And it's the way your body boom boom
Hit me right down to the floor
And I want you to freak me everyday, coming back for more
And I like when we boom boom through the night, boom boom
I want you to freak
I want you to freak

You got me at attention
With one look in my direction
Perfection, it got me
We got that instant connection
Keep doing what you're doing, don't stop
Tell me you can read my bad thoughts
Get closer and listen
Electric, switch up position

I can't help how much our bodies get along
I like you pushin' up on me, touching me

I want you to freak me through the night until the morn'
And it's the way your body boom boom
Hit me right down to the floor
And I want you to freak me everyday, coming back for more
And I like when we boom boom through the night, boom boom
I want you to freak
I want you to freak
I want you to freak
I want you to freak
I want you to ...

Yo shorty, swing my way
We can f-r-e-a-k
My prerogative is to show you where i live
We can bump, we can grind, we can party to this

I want you to freak me through the night until the morn'
And it's the way your body boom boom
Hit me right down to the floor
And I want you to freak me everyday, coming back for more
And I like when we boom boom through the night, boom boom
I want you to freak
I want you to freak
I want you to freak
I want you to freak
I want you to freak
