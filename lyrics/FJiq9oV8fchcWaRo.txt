Almost like a soldier
Thrown into a war
Caught between desire
And all he's fighting for

Options are so easy
When you don't have to choose
A real man knows he can get what he wants
But when offered, can still refuse

What's the point in following
The signs
When you choose to live your life
Between the lines

So you've painted
Yourself
Into a corner
And now you say you wish
You met me before her
Everytime I walk away
You pull me back in the game
And this goes on and on
And off and on
And off
And on again

Just after you met her
You said I changed your life
But that ain't stopping you
From making her your lovely wife

What's the point in knowing
Where you're at
If you don't change
What good is that

So you've painted
Yourself
Into a corner
And you want me
Hanging on
And off and on
And off and on
And off
And on
And off again

On and off and on and off and on

Almost like a soldier
Thrown into a war
Caught between desire
And all he's fighting for
