Whenever your gone gone, they way at the door and everything's hurting like
A bore

In the ocean fills like I am gonna drown
Someone save me someone has got to save me now
I am hunger for your energy
Your touch I need so desperately
Your love is the only melody
I need to feel alive
I gotta catch your high
Forget the night is just you and I
On the sweetest high
Do feel alive
I gotta catch your high
Forget the night is just you and I
On the sweetest high

Tell me that you love me
Take me on the sweetest high
I make you want never gonna say goodbye
I am hunger for your energy
Your touch I need so desperately
Your love is the only melody
I need to feel alive
I gotta catch your high
Forget the night is just you and I
On the sweetest high
Do feel alive
I gotta catch your high
Forget the night is just you and I
On the sweetest high

Feel alive
I gotta catch your high
Forget the night
On the sweetest high
Feel alive
I gotta catch your high
Forget the night
On the sweetest high

I need to feel alive
I gotta catch your high
Forget the night is just you and I
On the sweetest high
Do feel alive
I gotta catch your high
Forget the night is just you and I
On the sweetest high

I need to feel alive
I gotta catch your high
Forget the night is just you and I
On the sweetest high
Do feel alive
I gotta catch your high
Forget the night is just you and I
On the sweetest high
