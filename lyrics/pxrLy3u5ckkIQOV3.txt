Sleepless nights aren't new to me
All these thoughts are killing me
Someone come and put me to ease
All of my anxiety
There's no cause that I can see
What's this scratching at my brain?

And I
And I
And I can't stop, even if I wanted to
Up top, maybe I'm simply deluded
That's right, maybe I've been wasting my time
All my time
And it's hard to justify what you can do
I'm so sick and tired of falling through

And it's true, maybe I've been wasting my time
All this time
Come creeping, no one can hear you now
Listen, so you can show me how
Something, that I'm missing here
Softly, stab my evil dreams
Faster, help me fall asleep

No one knows, that's how it goes
All the thoughts that we transpose
And I can't stop, even if I wanted to
Up top, maybe I'm simply deluded
That's right, maybe I've been wasting my time
All my time
And it's hard to justify what you can do
I'm so sick and tired of falling through

And it's true, maybe I've been wasting my time
All this time
And I can't stop, even if I wanted to
Up top, maybe I'm simply deluded
That's right, maybe I've been wasting my time
All my time
And it's hard to justify what you can do
I'm so sick and tired of falling through
And it's true, maybe I've been wasting my time
All this time
From time to time
We fall in line
But now it seems that we are blind
No one knows that's how it goes
All the thoughts that we transpose
O-o-oh, o-o-oh
O-o-oh, o-o-oh
O-o-oh, o-o-oh
O-o-oh, o-o-oh
O-o-oh, o-o-oh
O-o-oh, o-o-oh
O-o-oh, o-o-oh
O-o-oh, o-o-oh
