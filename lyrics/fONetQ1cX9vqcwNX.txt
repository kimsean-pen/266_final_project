It really don't matter to me dawg

Tom, Varg, Morrissey
Bunch a timid white ___ who can't fuck with me
My daddy told me these white ___ can't keep a key
5th in his face, got him singing C (damn!)
Never (woo!) mind, you or me (okay)
Fuck a Johnny Rotten, I want Lil B (man!)
Fuck you niggas talking, this a killing spree (dang)
Pull up on a cracker bumping Lil Peep
God (God) damn (damn), holy sheep
Got my reparations, bought some jewelry (yoooo!)
I'm a left-wing Hades, 26 with a fresh .380

We gon show em how we do it down in the country
This Alabama though

Watch make you look cock-eyed
Racks make you walk wop-sided
And you know I rock real diamond
You ain't even gotta look at them

4chan on my dick cuz I'm edgy
Sit ya pale ass down, have a Pepsi (*sip*)
I'm way past flexing
Feel the dab in my chest, this is venting
