She said "Thanks but I'm broken
I guess you must have misspoken
What a laugh, I've never been chosen by anyone"

She was barely a teen, hangin' out in between
Just a part of the scene
With mercurial smile and incurable style
She was only a dream
How's that he didn't know a thing about
Makin' love to the kinda girl you read about

He said "I'm bound to be broken"
"My daddy bet that i'd amount to nothin'"
He won't let anybody show him anything

He was a troubled child
Had been down for awhile
Always kept to himself
though she couldn't defend he only wanted a friend
Now he's made somethin' else
It's so sad
No one saw it comin'
The paper said that he hit the ground runnin'

Oh Yeah
I know I'm not broken
A little cracked
But still I'm not broken
I wanna laugh but I think that I am chokin' on reality

When the world is turning for you
Don't turn on me
Who are you here to repair
Well I don't know what you mean
You could never resist
Glorifying despair
And now it's comin' to you and I don't really care

Well I'm not the kind to insist
You couldn't of missed
We must co-exist
So please listen to me
There is no such thing as human debris

Oh Yeah
I know I'm not broken
A little cracked
But that amounts to nothin'
I wanna laugh
I'm not jokin'

I'm unbroken
(Oh Yeah, I said I'm not broken)
I said I'm unbroken
(A little cracked, It's just a token)
I'm really not broken
(Well I guess, I'm unbroken)
