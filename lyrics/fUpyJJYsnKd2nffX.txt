I broke my bones
Playing games with you
This type of fun,
It makes me blue

Oh, I
I think I'm into you
How much do you want it too
What are you prepared to do
Think I'm gonna make it worse
I talk to you but it don't work
I touch you but it starts to hurt
What have I been doing wrong?

Tell me what it is you want
Tell me what it is you want
Tell me what it is you

Oh I think that if I had been enough for you
Would I be better?
Would I be good?
And I'll do what you like if you stay the night
You tell me you don't think you should

You do it boy, well
Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go

Oh, it's enough to feel better
If I could
I itch all night
I itch for you
You're just my type
What's a boy to do

Oh, I
I think I'm into you
How much do you want it too
What are you prepared to do
Think I'm gonna make it worse
I talk to you but it don't work
I touch you but it starts to hurt
What have I been doing wrong?

Tell me what it is you want
Tell me what it is you want
Tell me what it is you

Oh I think that if I had been enough for you
Would I be better?
Would I be good?
And I'll do what you like if you stay the night
You tell me you don't think you should

You do it boy, well
Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Oh, it's enough to be better
If I could

Yeah if I had been enough for you
Would I be better?
Would I be good?
And I'll do what you like if you stay the night
You tell me you don't think you should
I think you should
Oh, love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Love, I will let you go
Oh, it's enough to be better?
If I could
