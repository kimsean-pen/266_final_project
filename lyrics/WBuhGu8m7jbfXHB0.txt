You speak of grace like you've seen it
your precious blood begins to boil over
and we will never be the same again
now that i've got your attention
the plastic parts of people melt away
a blowing wind.it changes my position
but theres just something about facing our fears today
this won't take long
using words you feel are true
keep building the love
the beauty above me breathes out loud
as i learn to indulge in You...
the feeling of the wind as it touches my skin
just one of my addictions
well i made it my home but woke up alone
cause i created this myself
i'll hopefully be close enough
with a better understanding...
this won't take long
using words you feel are true
keep building the love
the beauty above me breathes out loud
as i learn to indulge in You...
honestly i'll never be the same again
but im trying
i tried to be something im not
in the end
i'll never be the same again
