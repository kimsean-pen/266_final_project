I'm not alone, just feel like a shadow,
Call it fate, I'm stuck in this state
Tangled myself in these silkened threads
Tucked in this mangled bed with this marbled pig's head

Hungry in this cell we've made for ourselves
Can you hear that sound
It's running through the ground

I'll show my teeth, pull the sword from the sheath
Started to drool down the side of your face
I thought we were made from love
Now we're eating our own rind
Thought we were made from love
Now we're eating our own rind

Hungry in this cell we've made for ourselves
Can you hear that sound
It's running through the ground

Hungry in this cell
Can you hear that sound
It's running through the ground

It's the way we were made to be
Tripping on our own feet
Cause we've poisoned those wells we dug for ourselves
