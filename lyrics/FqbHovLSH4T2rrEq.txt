I'll take a walk behind Melody Lane
I'll follow her as she turns through the rain
They say she's good but I can't feel the same
I want her
I saw her dance when she first hit the scene
Creep joint romancing with amphetamines
But tramps like me stay in shadows unseen
I went her
I'm not her kind of lover
My mind will not recover
I just want my time with her
MELODY LANE
I'm not the kind to kill her
I just want drugs to thrill her
We'll spend the night together
MELODY LANE
Her face lit up under yellow street light
With eyes of fear as she caught me in sight
I won't hurt her, but she knows that I might
I WANT HER
She pulled a knife as she lunged in the dark
Cut up my arm like a bloody remark
The curtains twitched and the hound dogs did bark
She left me for dead
I'm not her kind of lover
My mind will not recover
I just want my time with her
MELODY LANE
I'm not the kind to kill her
I just want drugs to thrill her
We'll spend the night together
MELODY LANE
I staggered on my way home
past leering eyes and taunting voices
As blood dripped from my flesh wound
I knew my thoughts would scream in terror
Forever and ever ...
Too bad she's gone, Melody Lane
