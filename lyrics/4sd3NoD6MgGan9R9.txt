Allow me to show you
the way which I adore you
allow me to show you
the way which I adore you

sometimes I think I must
just let you be
let you be a horse
all I want is to be a rider
to be part of you

allow me to show you
the way which I adore you
allow me to show you
the way which I adore you

sometimes I think I must
just let you be
let you be a horse
all I want is to be a rider
afraid so afraid
to lose you
if someone looks at you
turn into donkey
pretend you are lame

allow me to show you
the way which I adore you
allow me to show you
the way which I adore you

allow me to show you
the way which I adore you
allow me to show you
the way which I adore you

Equus by nature, timid creature
ready to run away
Equus by nature, timid creature
cares nothing for the plans they made

allow me to show you
the way which I adore you
allow me to show you
the way which I adore you

allow me to show you
the way which I adore you
allow me to show you
the way which I adore you

allow me to show you
the way which I adore you
allow me to show you
the way which I adore you

(I will hide you will protect you
won't let anyone take you away)
