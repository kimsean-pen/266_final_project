Hangs a naked light over your face
Shines electricness upon your bed
If it wasn't for your Stiff Little Fingers
Nobody would know you were dead

You never really did much living
You mainly sat and watched your TV
I think it had you on remote control
Ticking over nicely

But you screwed up this time
Now you gotta start from the bottom again
It's a serious game
When you gotta start from the bottom again

I want to be dead

The optician said 20 20
But you stumbled round like you were blind
You never saw beyond your own 4 walls
It's a shame you never saw the light

But you screwed up this time
Now you gotta start from the bottom again
It's a serious game
When you gotta start from the bottom again
When you gotta start from the bottom again
When you gotta start from the bottom again
When you gotta start from the bottom again

I'm gonna start now...
