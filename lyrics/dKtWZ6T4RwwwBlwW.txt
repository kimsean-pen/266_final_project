Our love's an ocean
Give me a notion
'Cause you know I'll never part
Our love goodbye

Our love's a season
Give me a reason
'Cause you know I'll never part
Our love goodbye

And together we'll fly
I'll give you my heart
'Cause no place too far for us
We don't need it

Our love's an ocean
Give me a notion
'Cause you know I'll never part
Our love goodbye

Our love's a season
Give me a reason
'Cause you know I'll never part
Our love goodbye

And together we'll fly
I'll give you my heart
No place too far for us
We don't need it

Baby, don't make me
Baby, don't make me
Baby, don't make me
Fly away
Gonna stay
Love today

Baby, don't make me
Baby, don't make me
Baby, don't make me
Fly away
Gonna stay
Love today

I love's an ocean
Give me emotion
'Cause you know I'll never see
A thing you see

I'll have a reason
Give me a treason
'Cause you know I'll never part
Our love's so hard

And together we'll fly
I'll give you my heart
(Give you my heart)
No place too far for us
We don't need it

Baby, don't make me
Baby, don't make me
Baby, don't make me
Fly away
Gonna stay
Love today

Baby, don't make me
Baby, don't make me
Baby, don't make me
Fly away
Gonna stay
Love today

Love is here to stay

Alone at last
I'll give you my heart
(Give you my heart)
'Cause no place too far for us
We don't need it

Baby, don't make me
Baby, don't make me
Baby, don't make me
Fly away
Gonna stay
Love today

Baby, don't make me
Baby, don't make me
Baby, don't make me
Fly away
Gonna stay
Love today
Baby, don't make me
Baby, don't make me
Baby, don't make me
Fly away
Gonna stay
Love today
Love is here to stay
I love you
Love you
Love you
Love you, girl
Make me fly away
