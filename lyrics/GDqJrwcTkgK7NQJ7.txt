Take my hand of funeral flowers in white
Why did you hurt me so?
You said that you never stood out
So go kiss Ann on the cheek, she's never weak
She likes the way you betrayed me

But don't forget
If I don't live today, then I might be here tomorrow
If I don't live today, then I might be here tomorrow
Be here tomorrow

Watch me shine as all the light closes down
That's just a talent of mine
You know I die whenever I want
So go chase fortune when I'm gone
I'm guilty of reading my own past

Don't forget
If I don't live today, then I might be here tomorrow, oh
If I don't live today, then I might be here tomorrow, oh
If I don't live today, then I might be here tomorrow
If I don't live today, then I might be here tomorrow
