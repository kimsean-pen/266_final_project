He's got everything he needs inside of all his little pockets
He is prepared like a father
I wish I could, but I can't

I wish I could, but I can't
I wish I could

He knows everything to take from each tiny little moment
He is wise
Like aged cheese he's got the rind
The part that's hard on the outside

I wish I could, but I can't

He is wise, he's got the rind
The part that's hard on the outside
He is wise, he's got the rind
The part that's hard on the outside
