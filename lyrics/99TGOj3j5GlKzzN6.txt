Yeah.
Its 50
One shot, One kill, What's the deal?
Yeah, what's the deal?
Listen.

Lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow Tips and Talons, when it rains it pours
You caught in lead showers, just because
Niggaz aint playin', when it rains it pours
Niggaz get set up, cuz when it rains it pours
End up wed up, cuz when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores

But lil' homie, in my hood, when it rains it pours

Aint nutin changed, niggaz doin the same old shit
Them new Hollow tips and them same old clips
In the projects niggaz fk with the same old chicks
And somehow they still think there game so sick
Now i'm finna rip, niggaz know i'm about my grip
I dont trick man i barely even feed a bitch
She say im stingy, i said i dont need you bitch
Go ahead leave, see if i chase you, shiit
Tell your mami, i catch her on the street i'ma get her
She know i'm on parole, why she call police on a nigga
She jus' mad, cuz a nigga pockets all swoll'
When she asked to borrow sumthin', i said hell naw
I was tellin' the lil' homies all about this shit
So keep your mind on your money and dont trus no bitch
Keep your head high notes when them pigs came

But her ass kinda fat so niggaz treat her the same
This is real.

But lil' homie, in my hood, when it rains it pours

It was blood stains on my stoop when? Eyeball? got shot
When homicide outside, nigga i'm not
Its the third time niggaz dunn circled the block
Its money out now, yeah, but damn its hot
They love to catch a nigga on a direct sale
They say tell us who caught the body or you goin' to jail
Look if you know the drill you stay the fk outta dodge
Say what's happenin' to the captain and what's up to the searg'
Fk bein' in a cage man that shit for the birds
Charlie drunk drinkin' While Irish Row's on the curb
I know a spot fulla niggaz tryna get a few bucks
Hopin' then nutin' come out they gon' have um some luck

PH to the deuce, they stumbled off Matt
Lost his re-up money man that's all he had
Magazine from the store so he can look at the cars
And do pull-ups in the park on the monkey bars
Man it's fked.
