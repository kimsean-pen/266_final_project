Still got the same old number
Still drive the car you hate
Still fighting with my father
Still staying out too late
Still leave the backdoor open
Still let the dog escape
Maybe I'm deep down hoping you'll come back to yell at me
Like you used to do
You were right
I'm just a stubborn fool who's living in the past

When we were young and we were free
And all your friends were friends with me
Swimming in our clothes
When the beach was closed midnight on New Year's Eve
And if you're having trouble baby, holding on to memories

I've got a king sized bed and a PHD in the way it used to be
I've got a king sized bed and a PHD in the way it used to be

And when you're at your movie or autobiography
That carries the sweetest details
Feel free to call on me
Write how I made you shiver
The ground underneath is shaking
The devil is in the details
He and I get on real good
Like we used to do
And you were right
I'm just a stubborn fool who's living in the past

When we were young and we were free
And all your friends were friends with me
Swimming in our clothes
When the beach was closed midnight on New Year's Eve
And if you're having trouble baby, holding on to memories

I've got a king sized bed and a PHD in the way it used to be
I've got a king sized bed and a PHD in the way it used to be

You know it's ancient history
And if you're having trouble baby, holding on to memories
I've got a king sized bed and a PHD in the way it used to be

When we were young and we were free
And all your friends were friends with me
Swimming in our clothes
When the beach was closed midnight on New Year's Eve
And if you're having trouble baby, holding on to memories
I've got a king sized bed and a PHD in the way it used to be

'Cause we were young and we were free
And all your friends were friends with me
Swimming in our clothes
When the beach was closed midnight on New Year's Eve
And if you're having trouble baby, holding on to memories

I've got a king sized bed and a PHD in the way it used to be
I've got a king sized bed and a PHD in the way it used to be
