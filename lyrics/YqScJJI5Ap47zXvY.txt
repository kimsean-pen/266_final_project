Time to roll, the answer floats on down the farthest shore
Of the mind
Roll the dice that sailed the ship and all the doors will open
On down the line
Tend to roam, the lesson learned, and then forgotten over
In our time
In that moment I awoke among the smoke and mirrors
I was blind
Believe, believe, believe, believe
Nobody knows
Believe, believe, believe, BELIEVE
Nobody knows for sure
It begins and on and on, the baby's born, the elder's down
All in their time
Start at dawn, the setting sun, the day has come, my mind is open
My, oh my (ah)
Believe, believe, believe, believe
Nobody knows
Believe, believe, believe, BELIEVE
Nobody knows for sure
Believe, believe, believe, believe
Nobody knows
Believe, believe, believe, BELIEVE
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Time to roll, the answer floats on by the farthest shore
Of the mind
Roll the dice that sailed the ship and all the world will open
All in its time
(ah) Believe, believe, believe, believe
Nobody knows
Believe, believe, believe, BELIEVE
Nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody
