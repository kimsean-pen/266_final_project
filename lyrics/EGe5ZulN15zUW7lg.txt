The city's beautiful
In the early morning air
Love the smell of sunrise
And everything becomes so clear

I think you are beautiful
And you know it by one look
Did you long for summertime
When you were growing up

And when it finally came
It wasn't round for long
You ecstatically stumbled around
One warm second and suddenly gone

One warm second and suddenly gone

I wish that time would stand still
If this was part of a film
We would watch the clip all day
Like a portrait of you and I

Like a portrait of you and I

The city's beautiful
In the early morning air
Love the smell of sunrise
And everything becomes so clear

I think you are beautiful
And you know it by one look
Did you long for summertime
When you were growing up

When your life's just a breeze in eternity
Why not take this one chance and come fly with me
Just this once
Just this second that soon will be gone

If this second was your life - what would you do?
If this second was your life - I would love you
If this second was your life - would you love it?

If this second was my life - I would love it
If this second was my life - I would love you
If this second was my life - I would happily die

The city's beautiful
In the early morning air
Love the smell of sunrise
And everything becomes so clear

I don't have to look to see
Today it's all so clear
Chimney tops start to glow
And that's when I will disappear...
