How Long
Nevio Passaro

It's not been a good day
I don't know the reason why
I look in the mirror
seems that time has passed
me by

you think I'm a winner
like in everything i do
I'm seen on the stage now
but I'm just the same as you
all my life
I've been waiting waiting
all the time
I am searching finding nothing

how far
do I have to run until I find myself
how long do I have to wait before I
know the truth
where's the love when you need it
when you need it
just like now
just like me

nobody told me 'bout the meaning
of my life
I try to find answers
when I lie away at night

all my life
I've been waiting waiting
all the time
I am searching finding nothing

how far
do I have to run until I find myself
how long do I have to wait before I
know the truth
where's the love when you need it
when you need it
just like me

profumi e favole
ricordi di un età
riaffiorano
fuga dell'anima
che mi libera
dall'immagine
di un'anonima realtà
how long

how far
do I have to run until I find my way
how long do I have to wait before I
know the truth
where's the love when you need it
when you need it
when you need it
when you need it
where's the love
where's the love
where is the love
the love
the love
the love
the love
where's the love
