Do you remember?
The notes we wrote each other, in the summer, are they calling
from your shoebox just like mine?

I can't let go, of these notes
That leave me haunted,
They're inside, waiting for me,
Calling your name
Sheets that wrap up everything;

I can't forget you or even pretend to
Live in a world, where you are not mine,
I'm wishing all the time,
Counting on comets.

I can't let go, of these notes
That leave me haunted,
They're inside, waiting for me,
Calling your name
Sheets that wrap up everything;
These paper ghosts in my closet,
They're stacked a mile high
Telling me, I love you, Oh
I loved you but it wasn't the right time.

And now all that remains of
The two of us is living in the words
That we wrote down, all the vowel Sounds, of I and U and love
Filling the pages up.
