[Jennings/Dorrian]
Sliding down a mountain, as dusk passes to day.
The antidote of elation, now lifeless masses wake.
Jaws of suxiety open, the luring vampire of agility,
a fatal invitation, sight hazing from me.
[Chorus:]

Oh midnight mountain, I require,
inner re-location, back to pinnacles high.
Drowning in empty faces, sinking in banal.
I crave the isolation of eventide when perception climbs,
I just need the injection, a dose to boost my flight,
a sonic blast of moonlight, nucleus ignites
[Chorus 2:]

Oh midnight mountain, now I'm revived,
stimulus transcending back to pinnacles high.
Screaming at doleful skies, absorbing all my sighs,
responding to my cries - downcast a thunder of reprise,
won't let the next sunrise, signal my landslide,
from ecstatic highs, I'm on top of their demise.
