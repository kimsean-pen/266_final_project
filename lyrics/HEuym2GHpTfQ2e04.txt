Parents, why won't they shut up
Parents, they're so fucked up
They treat me like a tool
They take me for a fool

Parents, why won't they shut up?
Parents, they're so fucked up
Oh they're so fucking dim
They look into the past
For future reference

Parents, why won't they shut up?
Parents, they're so fucked up
They don't even know I'm a boy
They treat me like a toy
But little do they know
That one day I'll explode

I'm a boy and not a toy
I will kill and I'll destroy
I'm a boy and not a toy
I will kill and I will destroy

Parents, parents, parents
They don't even know I'm a boy
They treat me like a toy
But little do they know
That one day I'll explode

I'm a boy and not a toy
I will kill and I'll destroy
I'm a boy and not a toy
I will kill and I will destroy

Parents, parents
Parents, parents
