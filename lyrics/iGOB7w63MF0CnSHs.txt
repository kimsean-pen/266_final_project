Some folks built like this, some folks built like that
But the way, the way I'm built, don't you call me fat
Cause I'm built for comfort, I wouldn't built for speed
But I got everything all the good girls need

Some folks rip and roar, some folks believe in signs
But girl if you want me, you got have to take your time
Because I'm built for comfort, I wouldn't built for speed
But I got everything all the good girls need

Well I got no diamonds, I got no gold
But I do have a lovin' and I just thought that you should know
That I'm built for comfort, baby, I just wouldn't built for speed

Well I got no diamonds, I got no gold
But I do have a lovin' and I just thought that you should know

That I'm built for comfort, I wouldn't built for speed
But I got everything, well I got everything that all them good girls need
