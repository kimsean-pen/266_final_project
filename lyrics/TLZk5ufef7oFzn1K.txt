Baby, we've spent some time together
But I know, I should be cautious
But when I'm around you
I can hardly breathe or speak
I thought you should know
I see your smirk, but it's not too unfamiliar
Let me tell you I know some secrets
But let me tell you in the middle
Of the flowers in the meadow, I'll whisper

'Cause baby when I feel your arms around me
I know you're the one for me
Baby let's meet your arms into mine
Cause baby it's your laughter, your smile, your eyes
Makes me shy
I know that's a good sign

All I wanna do is kiss your lips
I see you hide back when we're together
But I don't blame you, I know it is frightening
But I know all the ways that love can make you feel
I swear, I think you should know
Out with your friends, I'm at home just doing [?]
Writing all these songs and pieces
Oh, it's not really fair, the way you're on my mind, I tell ya

Oh, I'll tell ya
Oh, I'll tell ya
Oh, I'll tell ya
