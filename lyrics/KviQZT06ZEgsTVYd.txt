Smoke is clearing out, all the circling lights... blind me
I've been running out, now it's all just a fight... to breathe
I gave it all, yeah, I gave everything
I will never break the silence
When I look inside. I don't have to hide
If you're looking, you won't findIT
Who's the enemy?
Don't know what to believe

Living in the shadows
Living in the shadows

Light is breaking through a dark that is underneath
I know the truth but for you it's just out of reach
You took it all, yeah, you took everything
I will never break the silence
When I look inside
I don't have to hide
If you're looking, you won't find me
Who's the enemy?
Don't know what to believe

Living in the shadows
Living in the shadows
Shadows

I will never break the silence.
When I look inside. I don't have to hide
If you're looking, you won't find me
Who's the enemy?
Don't know what to believe

Living in the shadows
Living in the shadows
Living in the shadows
Shadows
Living in the shadows
Living in the shadows
