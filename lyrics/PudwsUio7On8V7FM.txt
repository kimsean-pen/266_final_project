Down by the waters where I once dreamed,
Beneath the silver moon there you'll find me.
My heart a pilgrim, my mind a slave,
Oh my eyes can't stand to see the light of day,
Cos life is lost without love wouldn't you say?

I wish you'd follow me to my peace,
Lend me your hands I'll bring you from your knees,
My love is patient, my love is true,
And I know the silver moon will shine for you,
Oh I know the silver moon will shine for you.
