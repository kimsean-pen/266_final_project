Someone is coming out to see the light of our destination
A maniac neurotic fool who wants to jump off the isle
How can you know that I'm the one
Who lives the maddest vacation
Another road another trial
Where's the difference
Tell me right

You can't stop me
To love the world with all its lies
(keep it to myself, keep it to myself)
You can't stop me
I'm close enough to kiss the sky
(keep it to myself, keep it to myself)

Why are you coming out to see the road of last destination
I won't look back for the shadows
They're growing up to me
We're trapped in this song
So we leave them to head our salvation
Another you, another me
Where's the difference
Tell it to me

You can't stop me
To love the world with all its lies
(keep it to myself, keep it to myself)
You can't stop me
I'm close enough to kiss the sky
(keep it to myself, keep it to myself)

Roadcracker
Bonebreaker
Street taker

You can't stop me
I love the world with all its lies
(keep it to myself, keep it to myself)
You can't stop me
I'm close enough to kiss the sky
(keep it to myself, keep it to myself)

I'm just another broken up
Mess them up
Running to the cosmic ways
