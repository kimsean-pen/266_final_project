i turn the light on
and see your pretty face
i turn the light off
wishing that i could free space
i turn away
and i know you're never far away from me
so i stay for another day

if there's a way
i'm coming right back to you
no matter what day
i'm coming right back to you
if there's a way
i'm coming right back to you
no matter what they say
i'm coming right back to you

i learn to run off
so i can keep the pace
and never a moment goes by
i wouldn't trade for your embrace
skies of gray
i know you're never far away from me
and i stay for another day

won't you stay with me
won't you stay with me
