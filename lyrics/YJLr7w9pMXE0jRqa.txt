A heaven, a gateway, a hope
Just like a feeling I need, it's no joke
And though it hurts me to treat you this way
Betrayed by words I've never heard, too hard to say

Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home

Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home

Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo
Ooooo

Each way I turn I know I'll always try
To break this circle that's been placed around me
From time to time I find I've lost some need
It was urgent to myself, I do believe

Oh, you've got green eyes
Oh, you've got blue eyes
Oh, you've got grey eyes
Oo, you've got green eyes
Oh, you've got blue eyes
You've got grey eyes

And I've never seen anyone quite like you before
No, I've never met anyone quite like you before

Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home

Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home

Oh, it's the last time, oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time, oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time

Oh, I've never met anyone quite like you before
Oh, no, I've never met anyone quite like you before
