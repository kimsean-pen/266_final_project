You chose to surrender
The best thing that's happened to you
What were you missin'
Were you just trippin'

Running away from your fear
Was the best you could do
You made this decision
You chose our division

Ooh ooh ooh
And I have no regrets
I wish you the very best
In all that you do

Congratulations
Now you are free you have earned your degree
Yeah you've graduated
This is your last separation from me there'll be
No more tryin' again
No more comin' back
No more forgivin' you
No more thinkin'
That somehow the sum will be different
By using division

Half of your friends would attend
Before they ever knew
Why they are going
To this party I'm throwing

They would be thinking that
I would be pleading to you
To get back together
Well how about never

Ooh ooh ooh
You're gonna miss me bad
So funny I have to laugh
You did this to you
Yeah you did

Congratulations
Now you are free you have earned your degree
Yeah you've graduated
This is your last separation from me there'll be
No more tryin' again
No more comin' back
No more forgivin' you
No more thinkin'
That somehow the sum will be different
By using division

Congratulations
You've graduated
You finally earned your degree
In your last separation from me (congratulations)
Congratulations
You graduated
To being alone by yourself
Let me throw you a party
Farewell
Farewell (farewell)
Farewell (farewell)
Farewell (farewell)
Farewell well well well (farewell)

Congratulations
Yeah yeah yeah
