Last Night I dream't I was floating With yo u
The river so deep and the sky perfect blue

If we leave behind
The dust in the sky
From the sound of sirens
The city will rise
Hold you hand in mine
We'll swim against the tide
From the sound of sirens
Love will survive

And when your heart is on the run
When it's chains have come undone (ohh ohh)
I will always be the one
To carry you home

Street light so empty
The lust and the muse
The lights all seem vincent
Are too much to lose

If we leave behind
The dust in the sky
From the sound of sirens
The city will rise
Hold you hand in mine
We'll swim against the tide
From the sound of sirens
Love will survive

And when your heart is on the run
When it's chains have come undone (ohh ohh)
I will always be the one
To carry you home

If we leave behind
The dust in the sky
From the sound of sirens
The city will rise
Hold you hand in mine
We'll swim against the tide
From the sound of sirens
Love will survive

Ohhh

When your heart is on the run
And when it's chains have come undone (ohh ohh)
I will always be the one
To carry you home
