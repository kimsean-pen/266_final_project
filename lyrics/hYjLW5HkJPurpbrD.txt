Are you trying to put me on?
I turned around and it was gone
Did I leave it in your car? On a table in a bar?
Or in your bed between the sheets?
The places where we used to meet
Wherever love has gone I need to know

'Cause she's a woman
Oh yeah, she's a woman
Ma, ma, ma, she's a lady
And I just love the way she moves
The way she moves, watch her

When you left
I didn't know how I was going to forget you
I was hanging by a thread and then I met her
Selling pictures of herself to German business men
Well, that's all she wants to do

Come on, come on
I don't want to try too hard
I don't want to wait too long
I don't want to live alone
with all this crap that pulls me down
Oh, tell me now, how would it feel
If I could touch you once again?

Where have you gone? Where have you gone?
The moon has gone down on the sun, oh, yeah
I know that you're coming home
You wouldn't leave me on my own
Everybody can't you see she's coming back to me?

Whilst you were gone I got along
I didn't die, I carried on
I went drinking every night, just so I could feel alright
Stayed in bed all day to feel okay
I felt okay, oh, I felt sick and tired, yes I did

She lived at her father's place
Played his records though they jumped
Wore her body back to front
I tried hard to make it work
Kissed her where she said it hurt
But I was always underneath

'Cause she's a woman
Oh, yeah, baby, she's a woman
Ma, ma, ma, she's a lady
And I just love the way she moves
The way she moves

I don't know why you pretend
That it causes you pain
When you know very well
You're going to do it again
You're going to do it again
You're going to do it again
And again, and again, again, again, again
But can you keep it going all night long?

Ma, ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma
Shake it, shake it
Shake your body, yeah

I know it's going to happen
It might not be today
It might not be tomorrow
Or even the day after
But some time soon, you're gonna see
You're gonna, you're gonna
You're going to come back to me

Whilst you were gone I got along.
I didn't die, I carried on
I went drinking every night, just so I could feel alright
Stayed in bed all day to feel okay, I felt okay

Where have you gone? Where have you gone?
The moon has gone down, gone down on the sun, oh
I know that you're coming home
You wouldn't leave me on my own
Everybody can't you see she's coming back to me?

Where have you gone? Where have you gone?
No, I didn't die, oh, no, I carried on, yeah
I went drinking every night, just so I could feel alright
Stayed in bed all day to feel okay, I felt okay

Whilst you were gone I got along
I didn't die, I carried on
Ya, I went with other women
What else can I say? I guess I kind of missed you
Whilst you were away, whilst you were gone
Stop
