Will you still play on my mind
When I'm proud of myself?
Know I only meant well

Not every day but every night
When I'm counting my lies
You're the ghost at my side

And is right, is right, Mick said
Just for tonight, don't mither me Meg

I have this dream where I'm alive
And each day I forget
What it's like to be dead

No I don't feel much anymore
Is that your key in the door?
Nothing else would mean more

And is right, is right, Mick said
Just for tonight, don't mither me Meg
