I married in the sun
(Tell me where, tell me where)
Against the stone of buildings
Built before
You and I were born
(Start again, start again)
Into my heart confusion grows against
The muscles fought so long
(Fought
So long)

To control against the pull of one
Magnet to another
Magnet to another
Magnet

Now we look up in
(Tell me who, tell me who)
Into the eyes of bullies
Breaking backs
They seem so very tough
(It's a lie, it's a lie)
They seem so very scared of us
I look into the mirror
(look into)
For evil that just does not exist
I don't see what they see
(Tell them that, tell them that)

Try to control
The pull of one
Magnet to another
Magnet to another
Magnet to another
Magnet to another
