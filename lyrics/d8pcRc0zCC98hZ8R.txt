I'll only run away
If you touch me like you'll break me
So love me like you hate me
Cuz that's how I like it baby

Put your hands around my neck
And tell me what you dreamed about last night
Then do it right
Cuz I'm not lookin for forever, just tonight

Don't treat me like I'm fragile
I'm not a piece of glass, you'll never break me if you tried, no
Don't touch me like I'm fragile
You'll only get me back if you can wake me up tonight

Know you don't wanna make a wrong move
No you don't wanna lose me
I ain't even mad if you bruise me, you ain't even gotta day 'scuse me
Don't be scared come pull my hair
Why you still standing there?

You're drivin me insane
All I'm sayin is I'm feelin you too much
All I'm tellin you is
Love me like you hate me
Cuz that's how I like it baby

Put your hands around my neck
And tell me what you dreamed about last night
Then do it right
Cuz I'm not lookin for forever, just tonight, oh

Don't treat me like I'm fragile
I'm not a piece of glass, you'll never break me if you tried, no
Don't, touch me like I'm fragile
You'll only get me back if you can wake me up tonight

Know you don't wanna make a wrong move
No you don't wanna lose me
I ain't even mad if you bruise me, you ain't even gotta say 'scuse me
Don't be scared come pull my hair
Why you still standing there?

Don't, treat me like I'm fragile
I'm not a piece of glass, you'll never break me if you tried
Don't, touch me like I'm fragile
You'll only get me back if you can wake me up tonight

Said you don't wanna make a wrong move
No you don't wanna lose me
But I ain't even mad if you bruise
me, you ain't even gotta say 'scuse me
Don't be scared come pull my hair
Why you still standing there?

I said don't treat me like I'm fragile
(Don't treat me like I'm fragile, woah)
Don't treat me like I'm fragile
Don't treat me like I'm fragile
