I was never faithful
And I was never one to trust
Borderline and schizo
And guaranteed to cause a fuss

I was never loyal
Except to my own pleasure zone
I'm forever black-eyed
A product of a broken home

I was never faithful
And I was never one to trust
Borderline bipolar
Forever biting on your nuts

I was never grateful
That's why I spend my days alone
I'm forever black-eyed
A product of a broken home, broken home

Black-eyed
Black-eyed
Black-eyed
Black-eyed
Black-eyed
Black-eyed
Black-eyed
Black-eyed

I was never faithful
And I was never one to trust
Borderline and schizo
And guaranteed to cause a fuss

I was never loyal
Except to my own pleasure zone
I'm forever black-eyed
A product of a broken home, broken home

Black-eyed

Black-eyed (broken home)
Black-eyed (broken home)
Black-eyed (broken home)
Black-eyed (broken home)
