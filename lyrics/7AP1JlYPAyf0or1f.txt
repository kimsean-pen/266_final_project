Sharp as teeth and stars
I can't give you up
Like a moth to light
Move like caramel
Till dawn
You glow
Till dawn
You glow

Soon be nothing
Of this world
Soon be nothing
Soon be nothing
Of this world
Soon be nothing

Breathe back into life
Stabs at happiness
Now we're having fun
Hold tight don't look down
Till dawn
You glow
Till dawn
You glow

Soon be nothing
Of this world
Soon be nothing
Soon be nothing
Of this world
Soon be nothing

Don't look down
Till dawn
You glow
Till dawn
You glow
