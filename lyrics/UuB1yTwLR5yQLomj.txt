Hey the sound is foreign.
Coming from in.
You knew at the start,
you'd lose what you owned if you were, to carry on.
Carry on, you better know just where you are.
Carry on, carry on, you better know when.
The sooner you go, the sooner you'll know when to stop.
Carry on, carry on, you better know just where you are.
Carry on, carry on, you better make tracks.
Carry on without me, carry on if you can.
Won't you carry on without me?
Won't you?
Carry on if you can.
