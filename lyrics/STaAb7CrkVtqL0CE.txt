So take one what you said
You put it in your bed
You rest your tiny head on your pillow
You wonder where you're going next
You've got your head pushed to my chest
And now you're hoping that someone lets you in
Well I swear I'll let you in
You know I'll let you in
Oh Kelsey
You

So don't let anyone scare you
You know that I'll protect you
Always
Now through the thick and thin
Until the end
You better watch it
You know you don't cross it
Because I'm always here for you
And I'll be here for you
(I know I know I know)
I know how it feels
Believe me; I've been there
And (I know I know I know)
I know what it feels like
Tell me Kelsey

And I'll swim the ocean for you
The ocean for you
Whoah-oh-oh Kelsey
And I'll swim the ocean for you
The ocean for you
Whoah-oh-oh Kelsey
Oh you, darlin

Now It's gonna get harder
And it's gonna burn brighter
And it's gonna feel tougher
Each and every day
So let me say
That I love you
You're all I've ever wanted
All I've ever dreamed of to come
And yes you did come
I want you so bad (so bad)
Can you feel it too? (it too)
You know I'm so
I'm so in love with you
I want you so much
I need you so much
I need your, I need your
Your touch

And I'll swim the ocean for you
The ocean for you
Whoah-oh-oh Kelsey

And I'll swim the ocean for you
The ocean for you
Whoah-oh-oh Kelsey

And I'll swim the ocean for you
The ocean for you
Whoah-oh-oh Kelsey

And I'll swim the ocean for you
The ocean for you
Whoah-oh-oh Kelsey

And you never, ever let me in (let me in)
And you never, ever let me in (let me in)
And you never, ever let me in (let me in)
And you never, ever let me in
