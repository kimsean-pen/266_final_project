I packed this bowl for two
And I, I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you
Yes, you know it is time
For us to sit down and unwind
I know the feeling, I know the feeling
So stay with me tonight
Gonna kick back relax
Make sure the ganja's packed
And we'll feel all right
We're flying high now
We're flying high now
I cannot feel the ground
We're flying high now
We're flying high now
My world is spinning round
So please don't run away
When my ganja's all gone
Promise me that you're gonna stay
When my flight is all done
There's only one thing left to do
I got this one nug this frosty purple nug
And it's big enough for two
