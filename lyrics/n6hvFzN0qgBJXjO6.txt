What goes on here in your mind?
I think that I am falling down
What goes on here in your mind?
I think that I am upside down

lady be good, do what you should you know it'll work alright
lady be good, do what you should you know it'll be alright

I'm going up and I'm going down
I'm gonna fly from side to side
See the bells up in the sky
somebody's cut their string in two

lady be good, do what you should you know it'll work alright
lady be good, do what you should you know it'll be alright

One minute one, one minute two
one minute up and one minute down
What goes on here in your mind?
I think that I am falling down

Lady be good, do what you should you know it'll work alright
Lady be good, do what you should you know it'll be alright
