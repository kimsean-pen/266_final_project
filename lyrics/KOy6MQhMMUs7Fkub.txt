How was I to know you just come along
(and funk my life up)
Lips like Debbie's, sing sex like strawberry songs
(Just funk my life up)
Never heard it coming, but she's just another woman
With a shotgun in her hand
(Funk my life up)
She's a bait, she's a beat, she's the rhythm, she's the band
(Just funk my life up)

And the girl's so fine
Makes you wanna scream Hallelujah
Yea-aaaah, ye-eeeeah

Sly hand, spinning wax like silk
Beats are dripping on me, are like spider milk
And I never had a warning when I woke up this morning
With my sunshine on a drip
she's my rock, she's my ball, she's the teenage, she's the trip

And the girl's so fine
Makes you wanna scream Hallelujah
Yea-aaaah, ye-eeeeah

How could i refuse I'm not fit to use
(and funk my life up)
say the only way I win is the way I lose
(just funk my life up)
And I never got a script, got a tip, got a little... up in my brain
she's the church, she's a sin, she's a diamond chaser
she's the rain

And the girl's so fine
you wanna scream yea-aaaah, ye-eeeeah

She gets me silly
she's like a trick on me
I don't even know her name, yeah she sticks to me
and in the climax, she would scream to me
yeah she sticks to me

She gets me funny, she doesn't want any of my money
so I poured it over her like gasoline
hadn't mentioned I'd back in my team
mean super girl smoking my green
super girl smoking my green

Oh Lord, reload, eyes bags, scream
free thing, oh rings, yet back sing
left out

And the girl's so fine
Makes you wanna scream Hallelujah
Hallelujah
And the girl's so fine
you wanna scream yea-aaaah, ye-eeeeah
