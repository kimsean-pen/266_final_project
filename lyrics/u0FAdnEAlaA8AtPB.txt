I had a dream last night
That you were trying anything you could to turn out the light
Trapdoors in a moving room
But I swore I wouldn't let them get a hold of you
Cold sweat, you're in my mind
Feels like walls are closing in and we're losing the time
Just some cheap threat I heard in my mind
But I'm never gonna let them take you out of my sight
Hold on, you and I
Even if this whole Earth goes dark
All my love is for you
All my love is for you
All my love is for you
I'll never let you, I'll never let you go I'm holding on
I'll never let you, I'll never let you go

You know it's the truth

Walked down a quiet road
In the silence they were haunting us like animals
Held tight to all that we had
In the middle of a riot with a victory chant
Too hard to tell 'em apart
It's an innocence they're taking from a sensitive heart
I call the howl of the moon
And hide the desperation that I felt for you
Hold on, you and I
Even if this whole Earth goes dark
All my love is for you
All my love is for you
All my love is for you
I'll never let you, I'll never let you go
I'm holding on
I'll never let you, I'll never let you go
You know it's the truth
I'll never let you, I'll never let you go

All my love is for you
I'll never let you, I'll never let you go
I'm holding on

There's nothing I can say
I want you more every day
There's nothing here we can change
I'm not running away
All my love is for you
All my love is for you
And I will never let you
I'll never let you, I'll never let you go
I'm holding on
I'll never let you, I'll never let you go
You know it's the truth
I'll never let you, I'll never let you go
All my love is for you
I'll never let you,
I'll never let you go I'll never let you, I'll never let you go
