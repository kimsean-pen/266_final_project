Lippy Kids on the corner again
Lippy Kids on the corner begin
Settling like crows
Though I never perfected the simian stroll
The cigarette scent it was everything then

Do they know those days are golden?
Build a rocket boys
Build a rocket boys!

One long June
I came down from the trees
And kerbstone cool
You were a freshly painted angel
Walking on walls
Stealing booze and hour-long hungry kisses
And nobody knew me at home anymore

Build a rocket boys!
Build a rocket boys
Build a rocket boys!

Lippy Kids on the corner again
Lippy Kids on the corner begin
Settling like crows
And I never effected that simian stroll
No

Do they know those days are golden?
Build a rocket boys
Build a rocket boys!

One long June
I came down from the trees
And kerbstone cool
You were a freshly painted angel
Walking on walls
Stealing booze and hour-long hungry kisses
And nobody knows me at home anymore

Build a rocket boys!
Build a rocket boys
Build a rocket boys!
