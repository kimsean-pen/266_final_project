Their sad eye
There I lied
All people cry
There to glare

But you will
Look glad
At them
You grin
At them all
Them all

Even when you won't
Even when you won't
Even when you won't
Even when you won't

You can
Forgive
Them, them
You grin
For
Them all

Even when you won't
Even when you won't
Even when you won't
Even when you won't
Even when you won't
Even when you won't
Even when you won't
Even when you won't
