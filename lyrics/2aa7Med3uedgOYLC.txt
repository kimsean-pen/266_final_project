I feel my heart explode to particles
Love is always here, and I told you so
Restless in dreams, love carved in stone
This rhapsody of life in a way I guess we all know it

Hand in hand, we stand while we watch you flow
Heaven, can you help us? No, we can't go

Covered by roses when this dance is over
We all know our beauty will die
The choirs have awoken, left our words unspoken
Remember you as long as I can
Hold you in my arms all night
And spill the wine until the end
We all have our place in time
Need to live every moment

We built our castles high, turned our dreams to gold
We took the blows with pride, went through it all
The dawn is closing in, new tales are told
This rhapsody of life in a way I guess we all know

Covered by roses when this dance is over
We all know our beauty will die
The choirs have awoken, left our words unspoken
Remember you as long as I can
Hold you in my arms all night
And spill the wine until the end
We all have our place in time
Need to live every moment

For all we are is falling stars in the night
A blinding light raging down from the sky
The rise and fall, the rhapsody of our lives
It's all we are and know we've gotta let go

She dwells with Beauty, Beauty that must die
And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips
His soul shalt taste the sadness of her might
And be among her cloudy trophies hung

Covered by, covered by

Covered by roses when this dance is over
We all know our beauty will die
The choirs have awoken, left our words unspoken
Remember you as long as I can
Hold you in my arms all night
And spill the wine until the end
We all have our place in time
Need to live every moment
