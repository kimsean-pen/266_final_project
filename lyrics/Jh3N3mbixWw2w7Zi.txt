I'm pretty simple but I have explored
Thought I had found it but I wasn't sure
Always a feeling that there could be more, could be more

But I've been there, done that, buyed it, tried it more than I can count
Choke it, stirred it, broke it, smoked it more than I can count

But out of everything you're my favorite
I tried a lot of things, but you're my favorite
Oh, I think I worked this out, finally worked this out
'Cause out of everything, you're my favorite

The way you kissed me wasn't typical
Take me out of my body something spiritual
Think I need seconds, maybe thirds or fourths, oh

But I've been there, done that, buyed it, tried it more than I can count
Choke it, stirred it, broke it, smoked it more than I can count

But out of everything you're my favorite
I tried a lot of things, but you're my favorite
Oh, I think I worked this out, finally worked this out
'Cause out of everything, you're my favorite

Momma can I keep him?
I promise I'll take care of him
Momma can I keep him?
I promise I'll take care of him

But I've been there, done that, buyed it, tried it more than I can count
Choke it, stirred it, broke it, smoked it more than I can count

But out of everything you're my favorite
I tried a lot of things, but you're my favorite
Oh, I think I worked this out, finally worked this out
'Cause out of everything, you're my favorite
