Lost in heaven I'll be waiting
For our time to come
You were saving my decaying
Forsaken love

I remember how the stars fell from your silky hands
In this autumn night on frozen battlefields

See me now, still I hold them in my heart so deep
Reaching out to be close to our fantasy

Lost in heaven I'll be waiting for our time to come
You were saving my decaying forsaken love

Let us walk this path to all our secret worlds
Somehow you are the one opening the doors
I will drink forbidden waters from your rose red lips
I will keep the key to let this be more than a memory

Lost in heaven I'll be waiting for our time to come
You were saving my decaying forsaken love
Gone to heaven I'll be staying we don't need to run
You were healing my still bleeding forsaken love

Oh you are light years away - close though distant
Still I can find you in me - your beauty radiant

In this story we're the heroes
Turn the page, let the tale unfold
Lost in heaven I'll be waiting for our time to come
You were saving my decaying forsaken love
Lost in heaven I'll be waiting for our time to come
You were saving my decaying forsaken love
Gone to heaven I'll be staying we don't need to run
You were healing my still bleeding forsaken love
Forsaken love
