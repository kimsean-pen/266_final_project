Fortune Presents Gifts Not According To The Books

When you expect whistles, it's flutes
when you expect flutes, it's whistles.
What various paths are followed in distributing honors and possessions
she gives awards to some and penitents cloaks to others.
When you expect whistles, it's flutes
when you expect flutes, it's whistles
Sometimes she robs the chief goatherd af his cottage and goatpen
and to whomever she fancies the lamest goat is born to kids

When you expect whistles, it's flutes
when you expect flutes, it's whistles.

Because in a village a poor lad has stolen one egg.
he swings in the sun
While another gets away with a thousand crimes

When you expect whistles, it's flutes
when you expect flutes, it's whistles.
