I know things have been a little strange around here lately
Because of all the stuff that's going on outside the house...
You know the pressure, the job, all those things that get way you down...
You know sometimes, just sometimes...
You bring that home with you
And I understand, but you know...
I want you to stop for a minute and think about how much we have together
