When the dance floor
Comes between us
I never knew it was the last time we'd b together
On the dance floor
If you can find me
I'll be the one, the one for you

In my dreams I saw a lady
Singin that singin that tune for me
Singin that singin that tune for me
Singin that singin that tune for me
They told me I'd never be a doctor doctor
Never be
Never be a regular MC

Now I'm MC'in all night
Comin' on through
I'll show you the light
This is gonna be a big night
Gettin up & gettin up high
Gettin up & gettin up high
Gettin up & gettin up high
Hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi

When the dance floor
Comes between us
I never knew it was the last time we'd b together
On the dance floor
If you can find me
I'll be the one, the one for you

Goin to the bar for another refill
Goin to the bar for another refill
Mates gonna lend me another big pill
Getting this way till I feel ill
Gettin a pill, gettin a pill
Gettin a big fat fuckin' pill
MC Boing in the racecar
Stealing radio bounce all night

MC King bouncin' all night
Up 'n' down; bouncin' all night
MC Boing bouncin' all night
Up 'n' down; bouncin' all night
Bouncin' bouncin' bouncin' all night
Bouncin' bouncin' bouncin' all night
Creating havoc in the club scene
I've been doin this thing so you kno' it's me

Danny L Harle, Lil Data
What's your number I'd love to date ya'
Don't ask me where I'll take ya'
Back in the club with a bar and nature
Got no time for the music haters
Got no time for reading the papers
I'm just gonna bounce before it's way too late
I've got a gift gonna stick it in their faces
