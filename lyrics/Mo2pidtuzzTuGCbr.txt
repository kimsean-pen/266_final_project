You said I could never find a way to ease your mind
But where I go you wind up in the dust
I tried so hard to have you reach another side of me
Instead you went to nowhere and forgot

So I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for

Desert heat can wear you down, but still I'm rollin' through
Did I see your figure in the haze?
I am driven by your thirst, to quench myself of love
The sun beats on me for the price I pay

So I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for, yeah

Night road leads me to a town of ghosts
I'm beckoned by the glow
Of kerosene and tumble weed
They're calling out, forevermore
Worth fighting for

I'm leading in the wind
Head bowed down from what I saw
My shadow for a friend
There's some things are worth fighting for

So I'm moving on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for, yeah

Worth fighting for
