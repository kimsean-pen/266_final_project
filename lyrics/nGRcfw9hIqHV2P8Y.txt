I can feel your fingers
When I close my eyes
Take your poison love inside
I fall into dreaming
I've been waiting for your touch to bring me home
Sleeping death will come and lead me out of the sunlight

Shadows pulling me to lie with you
When the moonlight sings
The darkness brings me back to die with you
I'd give it all away to be with you
My hearts waiting and breaking to return to burn with you tonight

Hating all I am when lying by your side
Taking everything of me
To leave only nothing
I hold secrets only dreaming eyes can see
Night time sanctuary seeks
The pain of the living

Shadows pulling me to lie with you
When the moonlight sings
The darkness brings me back to die with you
I'd give it all away to be with you
My hearts waiting and breaking to return to burn with you tonight

Lay down your life
Only for you
Forsake the light
All I see is you
Forever night
Live just to die for you

Shadows pulling me to lie with you
When the moonlight sings
The darkness brings me back to die with you
I'd give it all away to be with you
My hearts waiting and breaking to return to burn with you tonight
