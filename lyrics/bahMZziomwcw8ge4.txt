You know
You make me feel so good inside
Always wanted a girl just like you
Such a P.Y.T.
Pretty young thing
Oh

Where did you come from, baby
And, oh, won't you take me there
Right away, won't you baby?
Tendoroni, you've got to be
Spark my nature
Sugar, fly with me
Don't you know now
Is the perfect time.
We can make it right
Hit the city lights
Then tonight ease the lovin' pain
Let me take you to the max

I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there girl, oh
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care

I'll take you there

Anywhere (yes, I will) you wanna go

Nothin' can stop this burnin'
Desire to be with you
Gotta get to you, baby
Won't you come, it's emergency
Cool my fire yearnin'
Honey, come set me free
Don't you know now it's the perfect time
We can dim the lights
Just to make it right
In the night
Hit the lovin' spot
I'll give you all that I've got

I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there, yes I will, yes I will

I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And i'll take you there (yes, i will), hee

I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And i'll take you there, take you there, take you there

I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing

Tender lovin' care
