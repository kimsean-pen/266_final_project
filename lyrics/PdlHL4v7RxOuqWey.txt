She walks the line into her deathbed rings.
I say she's all alone.
Begging for forgiveness,
I won't teach her to lie or make a plan
with that clairvoyant stare and grin.
God won't forgive me,
for this I know,
and tradgedy unfolds tonight.
So sever my skin apart.
Take this sadness and close your eyes love.

Hey, call the angels.
This razorblade was meant for me.
Hey, call the angels.
We'll mutilate insanity.

She cuts the vein although it's much to dull.
I say she's all alone.
Fighting for redemption,
I know a little pain, a little lust.
I lose myself at night
to feel the rush of tearing my skin apart.
Take this sadness and close your eyes love.

Hey, call the angels.
This razorblade was meant for me.
Hey, call the angels.
We'll mutilate insanity.

Go deeper, I feel it, I see your ghost appear.
Go deeper, I see it, I feel your ghost appear.
I will say goodbye tonight (We sleep forever).
Hold on, hold on tonight love. We sleep forever. Hold on, hold on tonight love. We

sleep forever. Hold on, hold on tonight love. Close your eyes.
Hey, call the angels.
This razorblade was meant for me.
Hey, call the angels.
We'll mutilate insanity.
