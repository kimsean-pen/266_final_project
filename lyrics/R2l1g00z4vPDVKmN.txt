I try to stop all these
gay thoughts and feelings
I don't know where they come from

Oh all of these gay thoughts
I've had trouble concealing
since I was fairly young

I tell them I love you
I don't want to lose you
but they don't mind

I hardly believe me
I always deceive me
time after time

Part of it's nature
the other part seems darker
Don't know what to blame it on

Try to control my behavior
but this is so much harder
When I'm far away from home

I tell them I love you
I don't want to lose you
but they don't mind

I hardly believe me
I always deceive me
time after time

Gay thoughts again
they fill with every drink
gay thoughts again
consuming everything

These thoughts are mine
but they don't feel like me
these thoughts are somebody
I don't want to be

I tell them I love you
I don't want to lose you
but they don't mind

I hardly believe me
I always deceive me
time after time

The part of it's nature
the other part's much darker
don't know what to blame it on

Try to control my behavior
but this is so much harder
when I'm far away from home

I tell them I love you
I don't want to lose you
but they don't mind

I hardly believe me
I always deceive me
time after time

I try to stop all these
gay thoughts and feelings
I don't know where they come from

Oh, all of these gay thoughts
I've had trouble concealing
since I was fairly young

I tell them I love you
I don't want to lose you
but they dont mind

I hardly believe me
I always deceive me
time after time
