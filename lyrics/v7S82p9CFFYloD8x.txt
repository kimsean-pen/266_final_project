If this ain't rough, how?
'Cause I've stayed up, I'm making distractions
I won't lay down 'cause I woke it up
If this ain't rough, ain't rough

So long, overgrown
I had it down so long
Before I was headstrong
Days passing by now, dull

If this ain't rough, how?
'Cause I've stayed up, I'm making distractions
I won't lay down 'cause I woke it up
If this ain't rough, ain't rough

If this ain't rough, how?
'Cause I've stayed up, I'm making distractions
I won't lay down 'cause I woke it up
If this ain't rough, ain't rough

It was not my intention but
I'm wanting it all back, I'm wanting it all
Had I lost my reflection when
I let it all go, it was not my intention, what was my intention?

So gone, so withdrawn
Don't see no one, no Sun
No fun, I'm numb, I'm numb
Sleeping through my alarm

If this ain't rough, how?
'Cause I've stayed up, I'm making distractions
I won't lay down 'cause I woke it up
If this ain't rough, ain't rough

If this ain't rough, how?
'Cause I've stayed up, I'm making distractions
I won't lay down 'cause I woke it up
If this ain't rough, if this ain't rough, if this ain't rough

Was not my intention, was not my intention
It was my infliction, it was my infliction
Was not my intention, was not my intention
Had lost my reflection, had lost my reflection

Was not my intention
Was not my intention
It was my infliction
It was my infliction
Was not my intention
Was not my intention
Had lost my reflection
Had lost my reflection

If this ain't rough, how?
'Cause I've stayed up, I'm
If this ain't rough, I was headstrong
'Cause I've stayed up, I'm

But I want it all back,
it was not my intention, what was my intention?
