you don't get me
so you don't get me
you don't get me
at all
i loved you in the worse way
you couldn't make it to my birthday
and i heard you're doing okay
but i don't listen to the birds say
i was so excited when you moved into my city
now i'm only wishing that you'd up and leave my city
cause you used to be my city
wish you'd never came to the cave, its a pity
i can't drive without seeing your face in all the window of the spots at all our
places
asked my dad,"how long will it take?"
he said, "maybe forever, but it will get better give it some time, then maybe some
more you simply got so much living in store"
i get it, she didn't get me, but my heart is sore
now im seeing what this distance is for
you don't get me
so you don't get me
you don't get me
at all
i love you in the worse way
sent you flowers on your birthday
but i bet you didn't get them
i don't know your new dude's address or if you're with him
so you better leave a message cause if i see your number, ill reject it
and how am i suppose to get my rest in
if you keep testing, checking in, hoping that i ain't blocked you yet
saddest part is that you were a best friend to me
but now you're nothing more than enemy
guess that means it wasn't meant to be
but that don't change our memories
you loved me first then convinced me it was right
when i was just the first to hold you through night
so even though i tried, i tried now im laying here cause i died, i died
you don't get me
so you don't get me
you don't get me
at all
