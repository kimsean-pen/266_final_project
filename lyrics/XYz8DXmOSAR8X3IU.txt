Get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up

Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, this is outta control
Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, get gone

Now look who's coming, yeah
Look who's back
Quick, drop the bombshell straight to the track
The 21st century killing machine
Burnt on the inside
A five headed team

No I'm not the same, yeah
'Cause you're not the same
And you're not the same, yeah
'Cause I'm not the same
And we're not the same
This could never be the same
And we just want to survive

Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, this is outta control
Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, get gone
Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, this is outta control
Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, get gone

Now you want to save us
And you want it all
And you want the transmit
'Cause you want the call
And you were the one that made the worlds collide
But since that has happened, you've grown twice in size

I'm not the same
I'm not the same
I'm not the same
I'm not the same

Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, this is outta control
Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, get gone
Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, this is outta control
Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, get gone

Get up, get up (drop the bombshell)

Get up, get up (drop the bombshell)

Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, this is outta control
Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, get gone

Yeah, everybody drop the bomb
You're not the one who sings the song
Yeah, everybody drop the bomb

Yeah, everybody drop the bomb
You're not the one who sings the song
Yeah, everybody drop the bomb
Yeah, yeah
