My own land has closed it's gates on me.
All alone in world, it's scaring me.

I am here to prove you wrong.
I'm accused of something I live for.

In my dreamland, there's one who understands.
A friendly soul, trusting life in your hands.

Yes, I gave it all I can.
Now it's invaded by a stranger.

Keep in mind what you have heard today.
You might find that you are not so brave.
Are you man enough, carrying the load all alone?
When others have your own.

My old land is but a pile of sand.
Cold and bare but something still is there.

Yes, I gave it all I can.
Now it's invaded by a stranger.

Keep in mind what you have heard today.
You might find that you are not so brave.
Are you man enough, carrying the load all alone?
When others have your own.

I am a brave patriot, you are my land
You have my soul, you have all I had.
Now I am here, and I want it all back.

In my dreams, I climb the hills I see
And let a gentle breeze lead me to
Plains I once have seen and
Clear blue sky, I swim in lakes I find.
I build a house right there
That you can't take... never take away!
I am here to claim my land.
You can't keep me away, forever.
Keep in mind what you have heard today.
You might find that you are not so brave.
Are you man enough, carrying the load all alone?
When others have your own.
Are you man enough, carrying the load all alone?
When others have your own.
