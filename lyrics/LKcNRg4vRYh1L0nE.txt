Sinking with the sun
for lot of gris with everyone
that's all we want for me
together we look.

And when the summer came
you wanted why I left you then
don't wanna leave you behind
wish I could have some piece of mind

Sinking with the sun
Sinking with the sun
Sinking with the sun
Sinking with the sun
Sinking with the sun
Sinking with the sun
Sinking with the sun
Sinking with the sun

'Cause I'm in ecstasy
slowly this start you and me
don't wanna leave you behind
you shattered have some piece of mind

Sinking with the sun
Sinking with the sun
Sinking with the sun
Sinking with the sun
Sinking with the sun
Sinking with the sun
Sinking with the sun
Sinking with the sun
