I can't lose you
All this shit be coming
Back but I can't lose you
You could tell me all
The shit that I did to you
I've been running 'round
Your head but I can't fool you
That's my baby boo,
I can't lose you
Wish you took a fucking
Step inside my damn shoes
Just to see all of the
Shit I'm tryna prove to you
I can't tell you what
To do, it's all up to you
That's my baby boo, yeah, yeah

You shine like the sunlight
When I met you, you was
Acting just a little shy
Told me that you had no
Problem with just being friends
Couldn't help it, took two
Days and then the shit commenced
At first I liked you,
Took my stress away
I would die for you,
Do that any day
I'm so sorry, that I've
Struggled all this time
And still you love me,
Hope you take this as a sign

I can't lose you
All this shit be coming
Back but I can't lose you
You could tell me all
The shit that I did to you
I've been running 'round
Your head but
I can't fool you
That's my baby boo,
I can't lose you
Wish you took a fucking
Step inside my damn shoes
Just to see all of the
Shit I'm tryna prove to you
I can't tell you
What to do, it's all up to you
That's my baby boo, yeah, yeah

Girl, I love you
All these bitches don't
Got anything on you
Feel like dying 'cause
I'm drowning in my sorrows
Sometimes I don't know
What's coming up tomorrow, damn
Take your ass to Cairo
Had no license but
I gave your ass a ride home
I'm so stupid thinking
That it's all about me
I just know I want you as
My baby mommy, yeah yeah
