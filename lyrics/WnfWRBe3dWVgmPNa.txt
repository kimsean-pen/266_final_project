I thought I met the one,
she had everything I wanted.
A beauty in the Sun,
and we liked the same bands.

We danced, we laughed, we took a couple things
We screamed, we clapped, like kids in the rain
The time we had was something from the dream
'Till reality kicked in.

She said she would run away with me,
So I took her to the VIP.
When the lights went on she was gone forever,
never trust a girl at Coachella.
She said she was the one for me,
she was kissing me from cheek to cheek.
When the light went on she was gone forever,
never trust a girl at Coachella.

I met another one,
standing in a sundress
She was innocent and fun,
introduced me to her girlfriends.

We danced, we laughed, with water in our hands,
we screamed, we clapped, like kids in the sand.
She restored my fate in the human race
'Till reality kicked in.

She said she would run away with me,
so I took her to the VIP.
When the lights went on she was gone forever,
never trust a girl at Coachella.
She said she was the one for me,
she was kissing me from cheek to cheek.
When the lights went on she was gone forever,
never trust a girl at Coachella.

She said she would run away with me,
I took her to the VIP.
When the lights went on she was gone forever,
never trust a girl at Coachella.

I thought I met the one,
she had everything I wanted ...
