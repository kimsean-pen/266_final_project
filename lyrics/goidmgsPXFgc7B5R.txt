Love is in the air
Love is in the air
We're warm in the winter
Sunny on the inside
We're warm in the winter
Sunny on the inside
Love is in the air
Love is in the air
I'm crazy like a monkey
Happy like a new year
I'm crazy like a monkey
Happy like a new year
That's right everybody
This is Glass Candy
Making our way around the world
Searching out a face-to-face with you
One more time
Looking for a heart-to-heart
Whenever you're ready
We want you to know
If ever you should look in the mirror
And wonder who it is that you are
And wonder what it is that you came for
WellI know the answer
You're beautiful
You came from heaven
You came down to this place
To fill out the dark corners
With your everlasting light
And that's why
I love you
We love you
I love you
We love you
I love you
We love you
Shout shout shout shout
Yeah you
I love you
We love you
I love you
We love you
