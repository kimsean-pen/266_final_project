It's been a long while since we talked
And I hope you're doing just fine tonight
I think about you quite a lot
I wish I didn't, yeah, that's a lie

We're animals in the darkest night
Magical, can you feel the high?
Tragical that you're still not mine
But you're everything I need tonight

The way we move
I'm blaming you
For the things I shouldn't feel
Rosé and Veuve
One drink of you
So I know that we are real

When we're together
I want you forever
When we're together
I want you, I want you forever

So I heard you like romance
Long nights converse with the gentleman
Have you tried our circumstance?
My thoughts are nice just in your bed

We're animals in the darkest night
Magical, can you feel the high?
Tragical that you're still not mine
But you're everything I need tonight

The way we move
I'm blaming you
For the things I shouldn't feel
Rosé and Veuve
One drink of you
So I know that we are real

When we're together
I want you forever
When we're together
I want you, I want you forever
I want you, I want you fore-e-ever

The way we move
I'm blaming you
For the things I shouldn't feel
Rosé and Veuve
One drink of you
So I know that we are real

When we're together
I want you forever
When we're together
I want you, I want you forever

We don't have to go
Stay for just a dance
Turn the lights on low
This could be our chance

We don't have to go
Stay for just a dance
Turn the lights on low
This could be our chance
