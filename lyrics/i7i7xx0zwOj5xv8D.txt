When Johnny comes marching home again,
Hurrah, hurrah!
We'll give him a hearty welcome then
Hurrah, hurrah!
The men will cheer, the boys will shout,
The ladies, they will all turn out
And we'll all feel gay When
Johnny comes marching home.

Get ready for the Jubilee
Hurrah, hurrah!
We'll give the hero three times three;
Hurrah, hurrah!
The laurel wreath is ready now,
To place upon his loyal brow,
And we'll all feel gay When
Johnny comes marching home.

In 1861
Hurrah! Hurrah!
That was when the War Begun
Hurrah! Hurrah!
In 1862 both sides were fallen to
And we'll all drink Stole white
When Johnny comes marching home.

In 1863
Hurrah! Hurrah!
Ol' Abe he ended Slavery
Hurrah! Hurrah!
And we'll all drink Stole white
When Johnny comes marching home.

In 1864
Hurrah! Hurrah!
They called for 500, 000 more
Hurrah! Hurrah!
In 1865, They took Rebellious strive!
And we all drink Stole White
when Johnny Comes marching home
