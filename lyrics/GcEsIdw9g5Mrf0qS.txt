I'm breathing in pieces
Just tasting the feeling
All open, suggestance
Unspoken within

And it takes me to another place
The universe the endless space above, above
And the world is like a mirror ball
I'm spinning in the afterglow of love

One thousand stars
One thousand breaths
One thousand voices singing
One thousand heartbeats under my skin
This is where we begin, right here

Skin diving, slow motion
The colors are running
You called me, I'm coming
I'm taking it in

And it takes me to another place
The universe, the endless space above, above
And the world is like a mirror ball
I'm spinning in the afterglow of love

Come on in (x9)
Come on in closer

One thousand stars
One thousand breaths
One thousand voices singing
One thousand heartbeats under my skin
This is where we begin, right here

One thousand stars
One thousand breathes
One thousand voices singing
One thousand heart beats under my skin
This is where we begin, right here

One thousand stars
One thousand breathes
One thousand voices singing
One thousand heart beats under my skin
This is where we begin, right here
