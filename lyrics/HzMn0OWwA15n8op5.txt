I was born in East Virginia
North Carolina I did roam
There I met a fair, pretty maiden
Her name and age I do not know

Her hair, it was of a brightsome color
And her lips of ruby red
On her breast she wore withe lilies
There I long to lay my head

Well, in my heart you are, my darlin'
At my door you're welcome in
At my gate I'll meet you, my darlin'
If your love I could only win

I'd rather be in some dark holler
Where the sun refuse to shine
Than to see you be another man's darlin'
And to know that you'll never be mine

Well, in the night I'm dreamin' about you
In the day I find no rest
Just the thought of you, my darlin'
Sends aching pains all through my breast

Well, when I'm dead and in my coffin
With my feet turned toward the sun
Come and sit beside me, darlin'
Come and think on way you done
