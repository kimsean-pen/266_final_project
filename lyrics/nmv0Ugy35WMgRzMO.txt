Holding on for life, hey
Holding on for life, hey
Holding on for life, hey
Holding on for life, hey
Holding on for life, hey
Holding on for life, hey

Enemy, used to be part of you, bittersweet
But now you tell me lies
Up and down, cold and hot, swear to God, got to stop
'Cause I can't sleep at night

If you wanted love like this, blowing up with every kiss
Oh oh, should've known better
'Cause you find yourself alone, chilling you right to the bone
No, should've known better

You and me just running close the light
Giving up the fight, hoping we survive
You and me just strangers in the night
Giving up the fight, waiting to ignite
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
(Holding on for life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life

Lost in you, lost in me
Afraid of love, in too deep
So we just run and hide
Lightning fast, felt the crash
Scared to lose, fear attacks
We only know goodbye

You and me just running close the light
Giving up the fight, hoping we survive
You and me just strangers in the night
Giving up the fight, waiting to ignite
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
(Holding on for life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life

If you wanted love like this, blowing up with every kiss
Oh oh, should've known better
'Cause you find yourself alone, chilling you right to the bone
No, should've known better

Hopelessly holding on
To all those perfect nights
Let's pretend it's not gone
And say we'll never die (you and me just)

Running close the light
Giving up the fight, hoping we survive
You and me just strangers in the night
Giving up the fight, waiting to ignite
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
(Holding on for life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life

Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
(Holding on for life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life (life, life, life)
Holding on for life

Hopelessly holding on
To all those perfect nights
Let's pretend it's not gone
And say we'll never die
Say we'll never die
