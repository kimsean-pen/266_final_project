What You Don't Know

Matthew Dear

What?
What?

I'd give up all my cues for you
For you I take it off too soon
Some other way to get to you
Now give up all my feels for you (What)
I'd give up

I'd give up all my cues for you
For you I take it off too soon
Some other way to get to you
Now give up all my feels for you

(I know that you need me, need me)
What
(I know that you need me, need me)
(I know that you need me, need me)
(I know that you need me, need me)
What

Command me what you want me to
Do anything but upset you
I feel like I could comfort you
So let me take you by your hand
And walk beside you into something good

What you don't know, what you don't know
What you don't know, what you don't know
What you don't know, what you don't know
What you don't know, what you don't know

I'd give up all my cues for you
For you I take it off too soon
Other way to get to you
Now give up all my feels for you
What you don't know, what you don't know
Command me what you want me to
What you don't know, what you don't know
Do anything but upset you
What you don't know, what you don't know
I feel like I could comfort you
What you don't know, what you don't know
So let me take you by your hand
And walk beside you into something good
