Keep your eyes on me
There ain't anyone else
Skies are crumbling
People calling for help

When the clouds turn purple and the rain comes through
And I watch the sunset split in two
And there's fiery skies but in your eyes they're blue

You make me focus
When you love someone
The rest just falls away
You make me focus
When you love someone
The rest just falls away
It all just falls away
It all just falls away

Keep your eyes on me
In a bubble of us
Don't need their vicious dreams
No, 'cause you're all of my rush

When the clouds turn purple and the rain comes through
And I watch the sunset split in two
And there's fiery skies but in your eyes they're blue

You make me focus
When you love someone
The rest just falls away
You make me focus
When you love someone
The rest just falls away
It all just falls away
It all just falls away

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la

Focus
When you love someone
The rest just falls away
You make me focus
When you love someone
The rest just falls away
It all just falls away
It all just falls away

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
