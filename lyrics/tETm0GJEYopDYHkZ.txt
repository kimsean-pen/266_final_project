I was waiting at the station
When your train came in
Wasn't you I was tiptoeing for
But you gave me a grin
Felt my heart in my throat
Felt my soul going out to you
Could this be love at first sight?
I just didn't know
I just didn't know
I just didn't know
I just didn't know
I just didn't know
I was waiting at the station
When your train came in
Wasn't you I was tiptoeing for
But you gave me a grin
Felt my heart in my throat
Felt my soul going out to you
Could this be love at first sight?
I just didn't know
I just didn't know
I just didn't know
I just didn't know
I just didn't know
Don't you feel insecure
All about your love for me?
There's nothing I adore
More than a fake ugly day
