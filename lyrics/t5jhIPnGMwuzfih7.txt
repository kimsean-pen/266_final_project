Some folks were meant to live in clover
but they are such a chosen few
and clovers being green
is something i've never seen
'cause i was born to be blue

When there's a yellow moon above me
they say there's moonbeams i shoul view
but moonbeams being gold
are something i can't behold
'cause i was born to be blue

When i met you
the world was bright and sunny
when you left the courtain fell
i'd like to laugh
but nothing strikes me funny
now my world's a faded pastel

I guess i'm luckier than some folks
i've known the thrill of loving you
but that alone is more
than i was created for
'cause i was born to be blue

When i met you
the world was bright and sunny
but when you left the courtain fell
i'd like to laugh
but there's nothing that strikes me funny
now my world's a faded pastel

I guess i'm luckier than some folks... (repeat)
