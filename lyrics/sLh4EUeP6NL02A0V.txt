Game on down to the middle of the parties again
Getting the cool within the happy, they went fire (oh yeah)
Everybody talkin' 'bout the power of the gospel (blame-a-buddey)
Getting the cool within the happy, they went fire

INSTRUMENTAL

Game on down to the middle of the parties again
Getting the cool within the happy, they went fire
Everybody talkin' bout the power of the gospel
Getting the cool within the happy, they went fire

Seems to feel that beat you can't stop bouncing
Why don't we keep the rhythm just what it sounds
Now people wanna stop the friendly happening
But I needya to stop the sound, get this right
