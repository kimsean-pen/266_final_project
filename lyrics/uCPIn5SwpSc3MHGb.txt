Calling out, can't hear your name
Gotta get away, gotta get away
When I go, I'll go out alone
Everybody knows, I'll be safe in my home

Death do us part
Sickness and health

Made a plan, fixing myself
Trying not to drink, from a poisoned well
Slip away, asleep in my car
All the angels sing "Que sera sera"

Death do us part
Sickness and health
