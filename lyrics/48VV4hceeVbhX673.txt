I can hear her heartbeat from a thousand miles
Hear the Heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet, I'm running to her like a river strong

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come home to her when the sun goes down
Take my troubles all away, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, crazy love

Yes, I need, yes, I need her in the daytime
And, oh I need, yes, I need her in the night
I want to throw my arms all around her
To kiss and hug and kiss and hug her tight and, oh

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me sweet, sweet lovin', brighten up my day
It make me righteous and it makes me whole
Makes me mellow, down into my soul
She, she gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, crazy love
One more time, she give me love, just a little love
When I wake up in the morning
She gives me love, love, crazy, crazy love
