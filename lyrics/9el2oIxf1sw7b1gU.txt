World a reggae music on yah - eh
Keep me rocking with me daughter - eh-a
World a reggae music on yah - eh
Never lef' ya, never no sah - eh-a

Now just be nice and hold your space
I won't entertain no more disgrace
Out in the street the call it merther
when rhythm spacing out your head

World a reggae music on yah - eh
Keep me rocking with me daughter - eh-a
World a reggae music on yah - eh
Never lef' ya, never no sah - eh-a

Man showing how man feeling
Man singing goodness gracious I
Then thousand rydims peeling
It makes the spider kiss the fly

World a reggae music on yah - eh
Keep me rocking with me daughter - eh-a
World a reggae music on yah - eh
Lord I thirsty, give me water - eh-a

World a reggae music on yah - eh
Keep me rocking with me daughter - eh-a
