Round and round and round we go, round we go, round we go
Round and round and round we go
We go round, we go round we go

Breathe about the day, breathe about the day
Do I kiss it on the cheek, kick it in the teeth
Don't lie to me, lie to me, lie to me
Don't tell me that everything's easy
'Cause your life go by, and your life go fast
If you're gonna wanna fly, you gonna have to crash
Don't lie to me, lie to me, lie to me
Don't tell me that everything's for free

Cause the bottom is a rock
Yeah, the bottom is a rock
You've got to push uphill until you, drop

I go down to rise up
I get dirty just to clean myself off
I get dry, to get drunk
I get pretty just to fuck my face up
I get high to jump off
I go down to the bottom and I float up
I get found to get lost
I get dirty, just to clean myself off

Round and round and round we go, round we go, round we go
Round and round and round we go
We go round, we go round we go

Head up in the clouds, head up in the clouds
Do I let it float around, or do I pull it down
Don't lie to me, lie to me, lie to me
Don't tell me that everything's dreamy
'Cause the time go by, and the time go fast
If you wanna make it pop, you gotta go to
I won't lie to you, lie to you, lie to you
I won't tell you that everything's true

Cause the bottom is a rock
Yeah, the bottom is a rock
You've got to push uphill until you, drop

I go down to rise up
I get dirty just to clean myself off
I get dry, to get drunk
I get pretty just to fuck my face up
I get high to jump off
I go down to the bottom and I float up
I get found to get lost
I get dirty, just to clean myself off

Round and round and round we go, round we go, round we go
I get dirty just to clean myself off
Round and round and round we go
We go round, we go round we go
I get dirty just to clean myself off

The bottom is a rock
The bottom is a rock
The bottom is a rock
You've got to push uphill until you, drop, drop, drop, drop

I get dirty just to clean myself off
I get high to jump off
I go down to the bottom and I float up
I get found to get lost
I get dirty, just to clean myself off

I get dirty just to clean myself off
Round and round and round we go, round we go, round we go
Round and round and round we go
We go round, we go round we go
I get dirty just to clean myself off
