Well here we are again
Throwing punch-lines, no one wins
As the morning sun begins to rise
We're fading fast
We won't work this out

No we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)

'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight
Every single word's been said (whoa oh oh)
Broke each others hearts again (whoa oh oohh)
As the starlit sky begins to shine
We're breaking down

She screams out
No we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye

(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight
We don't have to fight, tonight
We just gotta try, tonight
(We're gonna work this out)
We don't have to fight, tonight

We just gotta try
Tonight
No we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No we're not gonna make this right

So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not going to work this out tonight
Well there's no need to fight
We're just wasting time
(Tonight)
If you give it a try well maybe you'll find
(We might work this out)
Well we know we're in love
So let's keep it alive (keep it alive, keep it alive)
Tonight
I'm starting to see the morning light
We finally worked this out
