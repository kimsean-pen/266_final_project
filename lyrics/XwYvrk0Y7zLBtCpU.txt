Armalite rifle, police and IRA
Armalite rifle, use it everyday
Breaks down easy, fits into a pram
A child can carry it, do it no harm

Armalite rifle and the holy Trinity
It? s used against you for Irish jokes and the BBC
Armalite rifle, please skew the aim
Armalite rifle, use it everyday

The rifle does harm, it shoots for miles
If a bullet gets you in the heart, destroys your insides
Armalite rifle, police duty, eh?
Armalite rifle, use it everyday

It? ll do you damage, it? ll do you harm
Blow your legs off, blow your guts out
I disapprove of it, so does Dave
It? ll do you damage, it? ll do you damage
Damage, damage, damage, damage, damage
