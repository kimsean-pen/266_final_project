What if I push myself
What if I try to do it all by myself
You and I could see for ourselves
With our brown eyes and all the rest

My heart's too old to survive this storm
Yours too bold to give the rest
So I'll just try to do my best
And let the time do the rest

And let the storm salt the sea
Or perform a wicked heresy
To our hearts and to our minds
I'll be there with you
Stay calm

I would never dare too look at you
For the fear you would see me through
Cause love and care is that made my heart
Cause love and care is that tore it apart

My heart's too old to survive this storm
Yours too bold to give the rest
So I'll just try to do my best
And let the time do the rest

And let the storm salt the sea
Or perform a wicked heresy
To our hearts and to our minds your brown eyes and all
the rest
I'll be there with you
Stay calm

And let the storm salt the sea
Or perform a wicked heresy
To our hearts and to our minds
I'll be there with you
But you stay

And let the storm
Take us home
Take us home

And let the storm
Take us home
Take us home

And let the storm salt the sea (take us home)
Or perform heresy (take us home)
To our hearts and to our minds
Your brown eyes and all the rest
