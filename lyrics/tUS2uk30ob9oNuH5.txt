Tattva, achyntia-bheda-abheda-tattva. (4 times)
Like the flower and the scent of summer
like the sun and shine
Well the truth may come in strange disguises
Send the message to your mind.
Tattva, achyntia-bheda-abheda-tattva. (4 times)
At the moment that you wake from sleeping
and you know it's all a dream
Well the truth may come in strange disguises
Never knowing what it means.
Tattva, achyntia-bheda-abheda-tattva. (4 times)
For you will be tomorrow
like you have been today
If this was never ending, what more can you say?
