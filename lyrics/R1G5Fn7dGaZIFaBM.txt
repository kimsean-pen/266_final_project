Welcome my friend to Hollywood
In the backyard with a friend on the telephone
The town right then it's cooling down
You're the one that turns it around
This high earned lost, forget about them
And this sound
Yeah, it's this sound

Round there, that Saturday makes
If you've got what it takes than fate'll come around
With that wish, crawling fame
Get yourself to a super town

Well, guess who's gone
Just like the palm trees
Sick, you stay at home
James Taylor's on
First bike ride feels real good
The flesh and night rhythm, more than you could
Imagine if it happens to you

And ask me if it matters
Yesterday's holy cup in half
Tonight you'll sleep
It'll be a heavy drive back East
