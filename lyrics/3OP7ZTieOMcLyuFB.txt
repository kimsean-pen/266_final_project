I can see we're thinkin' 'bout the same things
Yes, I see your expression when the phone rings
We both know there's something happenin' here

There's no sense in dancing 'round the subject
A wound gets worse when it's treated with neglect
Well don't turn now, there's nothing here to fear

You can talk to me
Talk to me
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free, baby

Dusty words lying under carpets
Seldom heard, well, must you keep your secrets
Locked inside, hidden deep from view?

Was it all that hard, is it all that tough?
Now, I've shown you all my cards, well isn't that enough?
You can hide your hurt, but there's something you can do

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
When you're down now
You can talk to me
T-t-talk to me

Though we lay face to face and cheek to cheek
Our voices stray from the common ground where they could meet
The walls run high to veil a swelling tear

Oh, let the walls burn down, set your secrets free
You can break their bounds, 'cause you're safe with me
You can lose your doubt, 'cause you'll find no danger here

You can talk to me
Talk to me
When you're down now
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free, baby

Well, I can see that expression when the phone rings
And I can see that we're thinkin' 'bout the same things
Is it all that hard, is it all that tough?
Well, I know you've taken all that there is, isn't that enough?

Well, I can see you baby
I can see you runnin'
Well, I can see you baby
Well I can see you runnin'
Talk to me
