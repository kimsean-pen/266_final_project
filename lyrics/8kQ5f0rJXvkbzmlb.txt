What was here before the rocks and forests?
I don't care
It's hard enough to deal with human forces
I was never happy for you
You were weighing me down
You never trusted me
But I'm alright now

Tell me what you wanted

I've been calling back to those before us
But they didn't hear
I've been losing friends and enemies
It's even now
I looked underneath the dirt and bodies
And there's nothing there
I can hear the voices echoing
It's in my head
Did you find a higher purpose?
It never worked for me
I'm just waiting around

Tell me where we're going
