You're talking to me
Eating sunflower seeds
And all I can see
Is all that I need
I can barely hear your voice
I'm reading your tea
But it's all right

I wanna know what it's like
Talk me through the night
You want to reach our height
Stay up till it's light

Grazing in the grass
Baby, it's a gas
It's all that we have
As we leave behind the path [?]
We talk about space
Got no time to waste
Seeing new places

I wanna know what it's like
Talk me through the night
You want to reach our height
Stay up till it's light

We're sinking free cruisers
Content for a while
Might think that we're losers
But it just makes us smile
Ripped shoes, wider [?] trouser legs
We're easily pleased
Eating sunflower seeds

I wanna know what it's like
Talk me through the night
You wanna reach our height
Stay up till it's light
I wanna know what it's like
Talk me through the night
You wanna reach our height
Stay up till it's light
