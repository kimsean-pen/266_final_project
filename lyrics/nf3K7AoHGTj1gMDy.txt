Shed our cold reality

We are low we are low
We are ups
We

Look up and see angels see

Now see inside me
Sheer and spooky
Never lose contact
Makes our life show up, show up
This place I have inside me I will learn to share
Yes you know

Get up all we had to now
We are low we are low
We are ups
We

Look up and now angel see
You have seen inside me
sheer and spooky

Never lose contact
Makes our life show up, show up
This place I have inside me I will learn to share

Never lose contact
Makes our life show up, show up
This place I have inside me I will learn to
Blessed my summering this way

Never lose contact
Makes our life show up, show up
This place I have inside me I will learn to share

Never lose contact
Makes our life show up, show up
This place I have inside me I will learn to share

Never lose contact
Makes our life show up, show up
This place I have inside me I will learn to share

To realize you are a liar
