Having my baby
What a lovely way of sayin' how much you love me?
Having my baby
What a lovely way of sayin' what you're thinkin' of me?

I can see it
Face is glowin'
I can see in your eyes
I'm happy you know it

That you're having my baby
You're the woman I love and I love what it's doin' to ya
Having my baby
You're a woman in love and I love what's goin' through ya

The need inside you
I see it showin'
Whoa, the seed inside ya, baby, do you feel it growin'?
Are you happy you know it?

That you're having my baby
I'm a woman in love and I love what it's doin' to me
Having my baby
I'm a woman in love and I love what's goin' through me

Didn't have to keep it
Wouldn't put you through it
You could have swept it from you life
But you wouldn't do it, no, you wouldn't do it

And you're having my baby
I'm a woman in love and I love what it's doin' to me
Having my baby
I'm a woman in love and I love what's goin' through me

Having my baby
(Having my baby)
What a lovely way of sayin' how much you love me?
Having my baby
(Having my baby)
I'm a woman in love and I love what's goin' through me
