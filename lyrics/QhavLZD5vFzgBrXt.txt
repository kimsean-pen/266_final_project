All I hear are whispers
All I hear are whispers

The freedom committee
First annual meeting of souls
There's lots of discussion
No action from those who chose
A lifetime of hate the better ones speak the most
Your last breath was left
Among the rapturous roar
All I hear are whispers

This is all we've ever know
Everything we've ever owned
Washed up with memories
Can life get sold

If you think dying is the easy part
Leaving life behind is the thing that's hard
(All I hear are whispers)
Dying was the easy part
There's nothing left in the end so journey far
(All I hear are whispers)

The under the earth
Or burning ashes the most
Just shoot me through space
I'll tell you how far it goes
A lifetime of dust
We're made of water of course
And when that evaporates is that where our souls goes
(All I hear are whispers)

This is all we've ever know
Everything we've ever owned
Washed up with memories
Can life get sold

If you think dying is the easy part
Leaving life behind is the thing that's hard
(All I hear are whispers)
Dying was the easy part
There's nothing left in the end so journey far

I'm a stronger man than I've ever been before
I put family in the ground this year
And I stand and watch their souls
Climbing high up out their bodies
And wondering where to go
Who said dying was the easy part

If you think dying is the part

Leaving life behind is the thing that's hard
(All I hear are whispers)
Dying was the easy part
There's nothing left in the end so journey far

All I hear are whispers
All I hear are whispers
All I hear are whispers

There's nothing left in the end so journey far
