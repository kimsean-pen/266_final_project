So, cut my hands and pull my arms in
All unforeseen but no surprise
For all the men in all your armies
Throw only bait that no one bites

Up and away we all go
Into the way we run
There you will find our stronghold
Though you won't find our guns
Up and away we all go
Into the way we run
There you will find our stronghold

We won't go to war

No we won't go to war
No we won't go to war

Say, all your time is almost done here
Waste all your light on other ones

Up and away we all go
Into the way we run
There you will find our stronghold
We won't go to war

No we won't go to war
No we won't go to war
No we won't go to war
No we won't go to war

We're getting away

No we won't go to war
No we won't go to war
(To deny it, To deny it
Is to go when you know that you're in it)
No we won't go to war
No we won't go to war
