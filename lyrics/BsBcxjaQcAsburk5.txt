Something in the dark is on its way
Beating of my heart is not the same
Something in the dark calls out my name
It's tearing me apart

No way out
Scream so loud
It makes no sound
It holds me down
It pulls me in
Grabs my soul
I can't say no
So I let go

Something in the dark is on its way
Beating of my heart is not the same
Something in the dark calls out my name
It's tearing me apart (something in the)
Something in the dark is on its way
Beating of my heart is not the same
Something in the dark calls out my name
It's tearing me apart
(Something in the, something in the)

Feel so free
Like I can fly
Inside my dreams
I feel like me

Something in the dark is on its way
Beating of my heart is not the same
Something in the dark calls out my name
It's tearing me apart
(Something in the, something in the)
Something in the dark is on its way
Beating of my heart is not the same
Something in the dark calls out my name
It's tearing me apart
(Something in the, something in the)
Something in the dark

Something in the dark is on its way
Beating of my heart is not the same
Something in the dark calls out my name
It's tearing me apart
(Something in the, something in the)
Something in the dark is on its way
Beating of my heart is not the same
Something in the dark calls out my name
It's tearing me apart
(Something in the, something in the)
Something in the dark
