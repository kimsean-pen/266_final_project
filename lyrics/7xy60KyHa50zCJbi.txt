I come bearing legacy that we caused jointly in our dawning land
i come with delivery and i have wrapped it in my mourning band

i give you my history that i expect your tender arms around
give it love and think of me
these are the letters from our compound

we see the dawning of novelty
where we embrace the grand of subtlety
time finally caught up with me
a mouldering image of a fleeing fugitive

toned down but playful
you say your greetings with goodbyes
your cup is brimful
sorrow stricken with a smile

now we found the cure
returning to the shore
change is always given to the searchers who explore

don't expect to hear from me
'cause i have got to feed our hungry mouths
i do enjoy your company
but we must work to keep you content

i see the better and worse in me
i embrace the grand of subtlety
but you finally caught up with me
a mouldering image of a fleeing fugitive
