I feel just the same way I did yesterday
I never wanna be found
I've made some mistakes
Baby, I can't replace
The way I used to be now
I never wanted life to get the best of me
But it was all in my choice
I never wanted life to get the best of me
But it was all in my voice

So take a part of me
Play the tape and put it on repeat
Take the pain and flip it onto me
Summoning the beast
I say obsession's obsession
And there's a truth to the lesson
We'll never get it right
If we keep on second guessing

Falling further behind into nothingness
Still breathing, still breathing
We've been looking to find a way out of this
Still breathing, still breathing

TAKE A PART OF ME

I can't live up to this
I'm so tired, I feel I'm crumbling
Is this what it feels like
To live under your way?

You never wanted time to concede fate
But put us in this place
We live in peaceful state
At the prompt of circling debate
Never to be reinstated, complicated
Born against the weight
Your compromise is left
With the sudden thought
That it's too late

Falling further behind into nothingness
Still breathing, still breathing
We've been looking to find a way out of this
Still breathing, still breathing

I say obsession's obsession
And there's a truth to the lesson
We'll never get it right
If we keep on second guessing

Pick it up!

Buried away
All thoughts are heavy in the feeding of pain

I can't live up to this
I'm so tired, I feel I'm crumbling
Is this what it feels like
To live under your way?
