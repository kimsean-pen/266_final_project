If you want me to listen whisper
If you want me to run just walk
Wrap your name in lace and leather
I can hear you
You don't need to talk

Let us make a thousand mistakes
'Cause we will never learn

You're my obsession
My fetish, my religion
My confusion, my confession
The one I want tonight
You're my obsession
The question and conclusion
You are, you are, you are
My fetish you are

You can kiss me with your torture
Tie me up to golden chains
Leave me beggin undercover
Wrong or right
It's all role play

Let us make a thousand mistakes
We'll never learn

You're my obsession
My fetish, my religion
My confusion, my confession
The one I want tonight
You're my obsession
The question and conclusion
You are, you are, you are
My fetish you are

Uhhhhhhuhhhhh
Come to me
Uhhhhhhuhhhhh
Tonight

You're my obsession
My fetish, my religion
You're my obsession
The question and conclusion
You are, you are, you are
My fetish you are
You're my obsession
The question and conclusion
You are, you are, you are
My fetish you are
You are
