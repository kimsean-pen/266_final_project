One day it comes and then it gets you
Crashing waves, you're thinking it's all over
I swear they're never gonna break you
Gotta hold on tight
Still alive just waiting for the weekend
This town it's easy to forget
Don't take the world upon your shoulder
Gotta get on home

She said "God bless this acid house"
She said "God bless this acid house"
She said
I get high for just one minute
I take my life and jump right in it
I see my friends in all our numbers
Rip up my plans, nothing matters at all

Got no reason to lie
Got a reason to try
We got time on our hands, our hands, our hands, our hands

Some day you found what you wanted
Felt like you're never gonna get it
Until we can't miss the last train
Gotta get on home
You know we change for the better
I said it's easy to remember
All we will ever need is right where we are

She said "God bless this acid house"
She said "God bless this acid house"
She said
I get high for just one minute
I'll take my life jump right in it
I see my friends in all our numbers
Rip up my plans, nothing matters at all

Got no reason to lie
Got a reason to try
We got time on our hands, our hands, our hands, our hands

Woah
Woah
Woah

She said"God bless this acid house"
She said "God bless this acid house"
She said
I get high for just one minute
I'll take my life and jump right in it
I see my friends in all our numbers
God bless this house and all its lovers
I get high for just one minute
I'll take my life and dance right in it
I see my friends in all our numbers
Rip up my plans, they mean nothing at all

Got no reason to lie
Got a reason to try
I'll give all that I've got to you, to you, to you, to you, to you, to you, to you, to you
