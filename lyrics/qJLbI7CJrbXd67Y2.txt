Playing world cup in the street
Making magic with my feet
I'm spotted by a scout
"Bring your boots, you'll turn out"
Put on the shirt for my first game
And scored a hat-trick won the fame
Local boy is hero gets a contract,
lots of zeros
Glory Glory Football Fairy Story

I'm captain I am class
I am the genius of the grass
Showing style and skill and grace
Wonder goals and lightning pace
10 to go at Wembley
all the crowd are calling me
To lead the team and win the cup
1-0 down, 2-1 up
