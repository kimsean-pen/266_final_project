My baby's hands, are cold as ice
He knows I'ma never come back home
He knows that I, like rolling the dice
Come run away with the girl with the roller skates

Wherever you will take me, let me dream don't wake me up
I'll never, no never be alone
So let me go, I close my eyes
Nobody knows that I, been waiting for

Feeling, got me feeling right
Feeling, got me feeling right
Girl on the roller skates, you've got the taste of good
Feeling, got me feeling right

Girl on the roller skates, you've got me dancing all night
I'm not afraid to skate, it got me feeling right
Girl on the roller skates, you've got the taste of good
Feeling, got me feeling right

Feeling, got me feeling right
Feeling, got me feeling right
Girl on the roller skates, you've got the taste of good
Feeling, got me feeling right

Girl on the roller skates, you've got me dancing all night
I'm not afraid to skate, it got me feeling right
Girl on the roller skates, you've got the taste of good
Feeling, got me feeling right

My daddy said, "it's time to grow up"
He don't see that my heads up in the clouds
And I don't care, I like to skydive
Come fly away with the girl on the roller skates

Wherever you will take me, let me dream don't wake me up
I'll never, no never be alone
So let me go, I close my eyes
Nobody knows that I, been waiting for

Feeling, got me feeling right
Feeling, got me feeling right
Girl on the roller skates, you've got the taste of good
Feeling, got me feeling right

Girl on the roller skates, you've got me dancing all night
I'm not afraid to skate, it got me feeling right
Girl on the roller skates, you've got the taste of good
Feeling, got me feeling right

Feeling, got me feeling right
Feeling, got me feeling right
Girl on the roller skates, you've got the taste of good
Feeling, got me feeling right

Girl on the roller skates, you've got me dancing all night
I'm not afraid to skate, it got me feeling right
Girl on the roller skates, you've got the taste of good
Feeling, got me feeling right

Girl on the roller skates, you've got me dancing all night
I'm not afraid to skate, it got me feeling right
Girl on the roller skates, you've got the taste of good
Feeling, got me feeling right
