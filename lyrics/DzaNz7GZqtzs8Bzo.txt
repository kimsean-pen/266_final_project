What is love
A simple word or a crazy feeling
What is love
It feels like I am underwater breathing
I've been waiting for somebody like you baby to come around
You make my heart beat like a drum
Bam pa pa pam pam
You make my heart beat like a drum
Bam pa pa pam pam

When I'm with you I'm in paradise
The things you do make me come alive
Out of the blue our words collide
So hold me until the sunlight
It's been a day or two
And you blew my mind
Would've never knew your love was so devine
So I'm gonna make sure you remember for a lifetime

Go with the flow
Let your body go up
Let your body go low, low, low
Go with the flow
Let your body go up
Let your body go low

Go with the flow
Let your body go up
Let your body go low, low, low
Go with the flow
Let your body go up
Let your body go low

Go with the flow
Go with the flow
Go with the flow
Go with the flow

Go with the flow
Go with the flow
Go with the flow
Go with the flow

How we fly
Every day is like the weekend
Hot like fire
Don't wanna wake up from this state of dreaming
All I'm saying this
You don't know what love can do to you 'til you're the one
Who's got a heart beat like a drum
Bam pa pa pam pam
You make my heart beat like a drum
Bam pa pa pam pam

When I'm with you I'm in paradise
The things you do make me come alive
Out of the blue our words collide
So hold me until the sunlight
It's been a day or two and you blew my mind
Would've never knew your love was so devine
Tonight I'm gonna make sure you remember for a lifetime

Go with the flow
Let your body go up
Let your body go low, low, low
Go with the flow
Let your body go up
Let your body go low

Go with the flow
Let your body go up
Let your body go low, low, low
Go with the flow
Let your body go up
Let your body go low

Go with the flow
Go with the flow
Go with the flow
Go with the flow

Come on, let your body
Don't go baby
Like a heartbeat
Don't go baby

Let your body
Go with the flow
Like a heartbeat
Go with the flow
