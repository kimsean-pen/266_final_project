Beautiful Delilah, sweet as apple pie
Always gets a second look from fellas passin' by
Everytime I see her she's with a different guy
Beautiful Delilah, that's the reason why
*Rebecca don't allow me to fool around with you
You are so tantalizing, you just can't be true

Beautiful Delilah dressed in the latest style
Swingin' like a pendulum walkin' down the aisle
Deep romantic eyes, speak so low and mild
Maybe you will settle down and marry after a while
(*Repeat)

Beautiful Delilah bathin' in the sun
Audience of seventeen, and notice not a one
Local Casanova
Wouldn't be outdone
Let her steal his heart away and break it just for fun
(*Repeat)
