My brain,
my fingers bought bottles in a package place.
Got
caught up on a park bench.
Everybody tried to get a taste.
When the sun goes down, I swear to God,
they'll try to run
you out of this town, and they will beat you down.
The will
beat you down if you stay around.
You're gonna get shot down
if you stay around, and you'll feel like a hungry dog in the
street on a very short leash.

My heart is a cancer; radiation wouldn't help a thing.
My
God doesn't answer; I pray nightly, every single week.
When
the liquor runs low, my friends run low
Got nowhere to go,
no religion could ever save my soul.
Nowhere to go, and I
feel like a hungry dog in the street on a very short leash.
