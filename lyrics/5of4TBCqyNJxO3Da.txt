I'm letting go
'Cause I can't take this anymore
Since you broke my heart in two (My heart in two)

I've been a little crazy lately
I've been out of my head
I remember every word you ever said (Said, said, said)
And oh I, I never thought you would betray me
A whole lotta regret
I cannot believe we're coming to an end (End, end, end)

And now you got me feeling so damn low

I'm letting go
'Cause I can't take this anymore
Since you broke my heart in two
And now I know
That you don't love me anymore
So take my broken heart with you

I've been a little lonely lately
I can't sleep in this bed
I remember every night we ever spent
And oh, I'm hearing every word you told me
It's stuck in my head
All your promises were broken in the end

And now you got me feeling so damn low

I'm letting go
'Cause I can't take this anymore
Since you broke my heart in two
And now I know
That you don't love me anymore
So take my broken heart with you (Broken heart with you, heart with you, heart with you)
Broken heart with you

We could've been something
But now you got me feeling
Down, down, down
Down, down, down

We could've been something
But now you got me feeling
Down, down, down
Down, down, down

I'm letting go
'Cause I can't take this anymore
Since you broke my heart in two (Heart in two)
And now I know
That you don't love me anymore
So take my broken heart with you (Broken heart with you)

I'm letting go
'Cause I can't take this anymore
Since you broke my heart in two
And now I know
That you don't love me anymore
So take my broken heart with you (Broken heart with you)
