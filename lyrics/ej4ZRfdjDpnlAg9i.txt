People talkin' but they just don't know
what's in my heart and why i love you so
i love you baby like a minner loves gold
come on sugar let the good times roll
hey
So many people live and make believe
that they keep a lot a dough up their sleaves
well my love baby isn't the kind that folds
come on baby let the good times roll
hey!
Let the good times roll
oh come on baby
come on baby andlet daddy do you so
hey yeah, baby let the good times roll
Our love is nice if its understood
it's even nicer when your feelin' good
you got me flippin' like a flag on a pole
come on sugar let the good times roll
hey!
Let the good times roll
hey!
let the good times roll
let me show a baby
let the good times roll
