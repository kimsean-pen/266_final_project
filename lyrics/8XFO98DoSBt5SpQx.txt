in her desk
beneath her chair
we found clumps of hair
here and there
out in the hall chris stumbled and fell
i slipped back inside my wall
to hide behind the walls
it goes on for miles through empty rooms
he slowly smiles
but late at night when you're alone
hands first through the cracks
then come the feet to your bed
to lick where you bled
on your scraped knee scraped just for me
behind the walls it goes on for miles
through empty rooms he slowly smiles
