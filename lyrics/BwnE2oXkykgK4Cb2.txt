The key is so distant
I've opened doors
Know when to listen
know what to listen for, yeah

The shelf in the room
has been the way
of holding me
and letting me stay

Kick me out
let me go (go)
I don't belong here no more

A releasing sense
of getting tired
Hold myself, I can't hold myself

The shelf in the room
Has been the way of holding me
and letting me stay

The shelf in the room
Has been so true
I can hide in the shelf in the room

Holding out (holding out),
Never hold in (never hold it out)
Holding out (holding out, never hold)
Holding out (holding out), never hold in (never hold it out)
Holding out (holding out, never hold)

Know when to listen
Know what to listen for
Believe in resistance
Don't let them tell you anymore

Is there anyway
To get away
Ask myself while I stay inside

The shelf in the room
Has been the way of holding me
And letting me stay

The shelf in the room
Has been so true
I can hide in the shelf in the room

Holding out (holding out)
Never hold in (never hold it out)
Hlding out (holding out, never hold)
Holding out (holding out) never hold in (never hold it out)
Holding out (holding out, never hold)

Holding out (holding out), never hold in (never hold it out)
Holding out (holding out, never hold)
Holding out (holding out), never hold in (never hold it out)
Hoding out (holding out, never hold)

The key is so distant
I've closed my doors
The shelf in the room
Is rain waiting to pour
