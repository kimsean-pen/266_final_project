1, 2, 3, 4

I walked until my face got red, I walked on
The light inside my head went dead, I turned off

I wish myself the best, but I'm broken
The light inside my head went dead, and I turned off

When you're moving, there's no ground beneath you
When you're moving, there's no ground beneath you
In the winter

She told me to stay the same, I pushed her into my game
I'm full of the bad, bad problems, so just take me away

Just take me away, just take me away
Just take me away, just take me away
