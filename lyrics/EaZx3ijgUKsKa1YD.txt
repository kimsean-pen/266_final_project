Don't wanna be a part of that scene, I heard
Of the curses with death
My life is falling into temporary sin
Cluster of roses and baby breath

I been trying and I been buying
And I've been lying and I've been crying
And that's how I know

All of the legends
Die at twenty seven
They all went to heaven
All of the legends
All of the legends
Since I was eleven
All went to heaven
All of the legends
I been trying and I been buying
And I've been lying and I've been crying
And that's how I know
That I don't wanna go

All of his dreams
Are in the fast lane scene
These habits go so fast, he can't see
Baby lost his mind
Nobody gives in time
The drugs are worth it
Or so it seems

I been trying and I been buying
And I've been lying and I've been crying
And that's how I know

All of the legends
Die at twenty seven
They all went to heaven
All of the legends
All of the legends
Since I was eleven
All went to heaven
All of the legends
I been trying and I been buying
And I've been lying and I've been crying
And that's how I know
That I don't wanna go

Can't be a part of the broken apart
Don't wanna know what my mom would say
Nobody left in this town
Stuck with this permanent frown
I'm ending all of this right now today

I been trying and I been buying
And I've been lying and I've been crying
And that's how I know
That I don't wanna go

All of the legends
Die at twenty seven
They all went to heaven
All of the legends
All of the legends
Since I was eleven
All went to heaven
All of the legends
I been trying and I been buying
And I've been lying and I've been crying
And that's how I know
