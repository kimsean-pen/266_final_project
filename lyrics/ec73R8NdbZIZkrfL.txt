You exist
And you're a friend of mine
You're alive; It's not the end of the line
(Will we ever learn?)

Cynical; the generations were abandoned here
No life is ever fair
When the mechanical fires are raging
The revolution's here

I can breathe again
I choose to never let go
Or lose control
See through the sights of a rifle
Live through the eyes of a child
Wake through the mind of a minor

To extol
I must change
Because I've been chasing shadows
(Change)

Immersed in the night
Desperate and taken
(Change)
Run with the pride of the lion
You exist
And you're a friend of mine
You're alive; It's not the end of the line
(Will we ever learn?)

I'm a failure; I'm the wreckage in the storm
I'm enlighted; unafraid I am reborn
Cynical; the generations were abandoned here
No life is ever fair
When the mechanical fires are raging
The revolution's here
End
