Young man in the daylight
You look so pure just singing
Young girl so innocent
Beat with big hands for no reason

Is it really a surprise?
Is it really a surprise?
Even if you do wrong
You still win me over

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know
He should be up there
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know
He should be down here

Young boy in the daylight
You look so pure just playing
Young girl so innocent
Beat by big hands for no reason

Is it really a surprise?
Is it really a surprise?
Even if you do wrong
You still win me over

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know
He should be up there
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know
He should be down here
