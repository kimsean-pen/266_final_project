What is in creation
The forgot had left us to stay
Show me rebellation
Or a thing that's not in the play
A tiny little ration
That is your do

There we go
What about this day?

Where's your destination?
Where belongs this song?
At least an absolution
When I'm doing wrong

There we go
What about this day?

What's about starvation?
We're heeding for the guns
What about a nation
Ready to jump?

There we go
What about this day?

What's in your prostration?
Can we find that place?
Where love is more a patient
And done with chase

What about this day?
