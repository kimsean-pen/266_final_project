I'm done with everyone
I'm sick of everything
I'm living on the brink of death caught
in a web of lies and deceit
I've lost all sense of my reality
Everyone is just a critic, a saint
So judge me if you wanna but you won't destroy me

Tic-toc, let's get it started

Dying on my knees
Call me pathetic but I've got good company
I'm not alone
Nothing to believe
I'm just a loser
Don't you try and save me now
Kiss it all goodbye and forget about me

(Forget about me)
(Yeah!)

I'm over listening
I don't need anything
I'm a classic train wreck walking
I'm deaf to the words they're talking
I'm locked in this prison of society
This world's full of liars and cheats
So call me what you wanna but you won't destroy me

Tic-toc, let's get it started

Dying on my knees
Call me pathetic but I got good company
I'm not alone
Nothing to believe
I'm just a loser
Don't you try and save me now
Kiss it all goodbye and forget about me

(Forget about me)

I said forget about me!
Forget about me!

Dying on my knees
Call me pathetic but I got good company
I'm not alone
Nothing to believe
I'm just a loser
Don't you try and save me now
Kiss it all goodbye and forget about me
Kiss it all goodbye and forget about me
