A week ago a huge crater entered my life
I can feel your hands on my chest
And you know that I like you the best
And you're mad at your shadow on the wall

I had a dream where everything changed
Nothing was the same
I woke up feeling new
and I meant
That at my falling out, I knew that its alright
But it's not the same (oh well)

Everything dies
There's no point in trying
Sooner or later
Love will die
And if it doesn't
I know it will take me itself

I had a dream where everything changed
Nothing was the same
I woke up feeling new
and I meant
That at my falling out, I knew that its alright
But it's not the same (oh well)
