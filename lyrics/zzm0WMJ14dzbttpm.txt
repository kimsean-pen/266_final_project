I feel you
Your sun it shines
I feel you
Within my mind

You take me there
You take me where
My kingdom comes

You take me to
Leave me through
Babylon

This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love

I feel you
Your heart it sings
I feel you
The joy it brings

Where heaven waits
These golden gates
Back again

You take me to
Leave me through
Oblivion

This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love

I feel you
Your precious soul
I'm a whole

I feel you
Your rising sun
My kingdom comes

I feel you
Each move you make
I feel you
Each breath you take

Where angels sing
And spread their wings
Our love's on high

You take me home
To glory's throne
By and by

This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love
This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love

I feel you
Your precious soul
I'm a whole

I feel you
Your rising sun
My kingdom comes
