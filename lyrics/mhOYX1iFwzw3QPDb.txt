Outside there's a bird and it is singing
And outside of my window, there's a life
I feel like someone's talking to my spirit
They tell me that there's reasons to survive

I could draw you a picture
I could write on my face
I could read you a scripture of tales

And I know, no matter how much colder
Or how much I carry on my shoulders
As long as I'm standing, I'll be closer
Cause it ain't over, 'til it's over
But we don't get down
No we don't get down
We can turn this 'round
And maybe
It's today ahh yeahh

Cause all these scenes of grief got my head spinnin'
And we're dancing on the edge of a knife
And could I be your hero or your villain
Uhh, I guess it just depends in whose eyes

I could draw you a picture
I could write on my fist
I could read you a scripture of this

And I know, no matter how much colder
Or how much I carry on my shoulders
As long as I'm standing, I'll be closer
Cause it ain't over, 'til it's over
But we don't get down
No we don't get down
We can turn this 'round
And maybe
It's today ahh yeahh

And I don't get down
Cause you lift me up
No I don't get down
Cause you lift me up

And I know, no matter how much colder
Or how much I carry on my shoulders
As long as I'm standing, I'll be closer
Cause it ain't over, 'til it's over
But we don't get down
No we don't get down
We can turn this 'round
And maybe
It's today ahh yeahh
