You paint me red in this light that isn't mine
Finding every reason you can find
To question my love

Remember that it's not me
I was never the one who broke your heart
We both know I've been gentle from the start

So though the questions keep on coming, this time
You know that I'll listen
You know I'll be patient
With you, you're my baby

Maybe this time, you'll know you can trust me
You know I'll be faithful
To you, you're my baby

I was never cheating
You connected dots that weren't there
You gave attention to the thoughts I'd never wear
It's not my style

Even though it's so clear to me
You shouldn't base the future on the past
I know you really want this thing to last

So though the questions keep on coming, this time
You know that I'll listen
You know I'll be patient
With you, you're my baby

Maybe this time, you'll know you can trust me
You know I'll be faithful
To you, you're my baby

I don't wanna fight, now
Your bark and your bite, now
To prove that I'm right, now
That you've lost your sight, now

I'm holding it tight, now
Can't see through the night, how
To show you my light, now
To paint these walls white, now

I don't wanna fight, now
Your bark and your bite, now
To prove that I'm right, now
That you've lost your sight, now

I'm holding it tight, now
Can't see through the night, how
To show you my light, now
To paint these walls white, now

So though the questions keep on coming, this time
You know that I'll listen
You know I'll be patient
With you, you're my baby

Maybe this time, you'll know you can trust me
You know I'll be faithful

So though the questions keep on coming, this time
You know that I'll listen
You know I'll be patient
With you, you're my baby

Maybe this time, you'll know you can trust me
You know I'll be faithful
To you, you're my baby

To you, you're my baby
To you, you're my baby
To you, you're my baby

I don't wanna fight, now
Your bark and your bite, now
To prove that I'm right, now
That you've lost your sight, now

I'm holding it tight, now
Can't see through the night, how
To show you my light, now
To paint these walls white, now
