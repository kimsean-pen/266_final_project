There's a silhouette falling from the sky
See it, there she goes
And it's heaven like
On the count of three
I should disappear
Go up in a cloud of smoke
So don't close your eyes

A cold sweat when I woke up in the dead of night
So lost, God, we're so lost
Can't understand why I kept running toward the bright lights

It was a nice cold winter of '98
Forever never felt so far away
I sang the song and recorded it on video tape
If only I could have that yesterday
I was the last slow dance on a Saturday night
No, the seconds didn't feel like they were passing by
She saw me standing in the street in the car headlights
With four words before I say goodbye

Streamers and balloons
Candles in the cake
I spin a disco ball
'Neath suburban sky
We went up the stairs
And walked down the hall
Past your sisters room
And I don't wanna close my eyes

A cold sweat when I woke up in the dead of night
So lost, God, we're so lost
Can't understand why I kept running toward the bright lights

It was a nice cold winter of '98
Forever never felt so far away
I sang the song and recorded it on video tape
If only I could have that yesterday
I was the last slow dance on a Saturday night
No, the seconds didn't feel like they were passing by
She saw me standing in the street in the car headlights
With four words before I say goodbye
Say goodbye, say goodbye, say goodbye, goodbye

It was a nice cold winter of '98
Forever never felt so far away
I sang the song and recorded it on video tape
If only I could have that yesterday
I was the last slow dance on a Saturday night
No, the seconds didn't feel like they were passing by
She saw me standing in the street in the car headlights
With four words before I say goodbye
