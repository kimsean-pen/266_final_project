Take me to
Take me to
Make it through

Take me to
Take me to
Make it through

These magnetic minds
Cause us to align
We won't come down
We won't come down
If you want to fight the city's glow
Come alive let it show
We'll show you how
We'll show you how

With the rhythm of night
In the City of Lights
We dance to show
We still can glow
In the rhythm of night
With the city of lights
We dance to show

Take me to The rhythm of night
Make it through
The rhythm of night
Take me to The rhythm of night
Make it through
The rhythm

Passion running wild
Dancing in denial
We are the Sum
The lifeblood of
The City's lights
They need to glow
This human life will make it so
We won't come down
We'll show you how

With the rhythm of night
In the City of Lights
We dance to show
We still can glow
In the rhythm of night
With the city of lights
We dance to show

Take me to The rhythm of night
Make it through
The rhythm of night
Take me to The rhythm of night
Make it through
The rhythm

If you can't survive this spell again
If you can't survive
Just let go

If you can't survive this spell again
If you can't survive
Just let go

In rhythm of night
In rhythm of night
In rhythm of night

With the rhythm of night
In the City of Lights
We dance to show
We still can glow
In the rhythm of night
With the city of lights
We dance to show

Take me to The rhythm of night
Make it through
The rhythm of night
Take me to The rhythm of night
Make it through
The rhythm
