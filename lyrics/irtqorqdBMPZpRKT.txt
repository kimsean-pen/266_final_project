Hadnur the Blind shot the arrow that killed Fijo's good and
Shining son. The gods could not utter a single word when they saw
What had happened. He understood that something was wrong, but
Nobody said anything; not to him nor to anyone else. Not for a
While. He started to cry, feeling the terrible loss, but it was
Too late. Beldegir was dead by his hands. He walked away, alone
To his house, to cry and mourn in solitude. Hated by the others
Spurned by the others. He could not help it, he did know what
Would happen when he shot that arrow. He did not mean to kill his
Own brother
Hadnur is waiting for the avenger to come, waiting for Woli to
Kill him. He regrets deeply what he has done, but knows death is
The only solution. He will be back when the new world rises from
The ashes of the old. Then he will no longer be alone, he will
Meet his brother Beldegir again, and embrace him in the grass
Where Wuotan, his dear father, was killed by Fanjariho. Then he
Will no longer by the crying demon
