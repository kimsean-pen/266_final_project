Do you remember what I said?
The night that I just spilled my soul
I told you things about myself
Things that no one else should know
You see the thoughts behind my eyes
You try to ask but you want pride
I feel the same but we don't speak
You cannot make up your mind
It's always some form of excuse
There's nothing left for me to prove
I'm tryna hold on cause I know I hate to lose

What happened to the one I loved?
Was it changing me not strong enough?
Was there something else?
'Cause I tried my best
What happened to the one I loved?
Was the sober me not good enough?
Is there someone new?
I can't get through to you

I can't get out of my head
Time with you is what I dread
When it's you and me, apparently
I don't seem to faze you
So I chase you
Just to be shot down and never break through
All these fucked up restless nights
Always hung my sleepless mind
Only trying to survive
But you won't even look me in my eyes
Always some form of excuse
There's nothing left for me to prove
I'm tryna hold on but I know I need to lose

What happened to the one I loved?
Was it changing me not strong enough?
Was there something else?
'Cause I tried my best
What happened to the one I loved?
Was the sober me not good enough?
Is there someone new?
I can't get through to you

I tried to think out loud
And with every sound, she breaks
With a shattered soul, she was a black hole in our own space
Even in our own space

What happened to the one I loved?
Was the sober me not good enough?
Was there something else?
'Cause I tried my best
What happened to the one I loved?
Was the sober me not strong enough?
Is it something else?
I can't get through to you

What happened to the one I loved?
Was it changing me not strong enough?
Was there something else?
'Cause I tried my best
What happened to the one I loved?
Was the sober me not good enough?
Is there someone new?
I can't get through to you

What happened to the one I loved?
Was it changing me not strong enough?
Was there something else?
'Cause I tried my best
What happened to the one I loved?
Was the sober me not good enough?
Is there someone new?
I can't get through to you

Is there someone new?
I can't get through to you
