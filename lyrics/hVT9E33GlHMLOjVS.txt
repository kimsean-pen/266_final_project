Here we are again,
The start of the end
But there's more
I only want to see if you'll give up on me
But there's always more

There is more
International feel
And there is more
Interplanetary deals
But there is more
Interstellar appeal
Still there is more
Universal ideal
Still there is more
International feel

I swear something lies
In your ears and your eyes
Cause there's more
You hear and you see
yet you do not believe
That there's always more

There is more
International feel
And there is more
Interplanetary deals
But there is more
Interstellar appeal
Still there's more
Universal ideal
Still there's more
International feel

I know, I know.
