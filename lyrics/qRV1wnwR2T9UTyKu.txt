Do you remember I searched you out
How I climbed your city's walls?
Do you remember me as devout
How I prayed for your calls?

I stood still is what I did
Love like ours is never fixed

I stuck around
I did behave
I saved you every time
I was a fool for love
I was a fool for love
I was a fool Then you blamed me and blocked me out
How long did you think I'd last?
Then you disappeared for weeks to pout
How many times could I pack?

But stand still is all I did
Love like ours is never fixed

Still I stuck around
I did behave
I saved you every time
I was a fool for love
I was a fool for love
I was a fool If you're worried that I might've changed
Left behind all of my foolish ways
You best be looking for somebody else
Without a foolish heart, a foolish heart

But stand still is all we did
Love like ours is never fixed

I stuck around
I did behave
I saved you every time
I was a fool for love
I was a fool for love
I was a fool
