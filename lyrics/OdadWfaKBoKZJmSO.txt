Every finger in the room is pointing at me
I want to spit in their faces then I get afraid what that could bring
I got a bowling ball in my stomach, I got a desert in my mouth
Figures that my courage would choose to sell out now

I've been looking for a saviour in these dirty streets
Looking for a saviour beneath these dirty sheets
I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in
Just what god needs, one more victim

Why do we crucify ourselves every day?
I crucify myself and nothing I do is good enough for you
I crucify myself every day
I crucify myself and my heart is sick of being
I said my heart is sick of being in chains
Chains

Got a kick for a dog begging for love
I got to have my suffering so that I can have my cross
I know a cat named Easter, he says, will you ever learn
You're just an empty cage, girl, if you kill the bird

I've been looking for a saviour in these dirty streets
Looking for a saviour beneath these dirty sheets
I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in
Got enough guilt to start my own religion

Why do we crucify ourselves every day?
I crucify myself and nothing I do is good enough for you
I crucify myself every day
I crucify myself and my heart is sick of being
I said my heart is sick of being in chains
Chains

Please be
Save me
I cry

Looking for a saviour in these dirty streets
Looking for a saviour beneath these dirty sheets
I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in
Where are those angels when you need them

Why do we crucify ourselves every day
I crucify myself and nothing I do is good enough for you
I crucify myself every day
I crucify myself and my heart is sick of being
I said my heart is sick of being in chains
Chains

Why do we in chains
Why do we crucify ourselves
Crucify ourselves every day
Why do we crucify ourselves
Why do we crucify ourselves
Chains
Why do we crucify ourselves
Chains
Why do we crucify ourselves
I'm never going back again to crucify myself again you know
Why do we crucify ourselves
I'm never going back again to crucify myself again every day
