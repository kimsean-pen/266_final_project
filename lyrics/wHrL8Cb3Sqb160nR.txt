Love is a drug and you are my cigarette
Love is addiction and you are my Nicorette
Love is a drug like chocolate, like cigarettes
I'm feeling sick, I've got to medicate myself

I want your love, don't try to stop me
Can't get enough, still hanging on me
Your guilty heart, don't let it break you
And if you pray, well no one's gonna save you

Like everyone that you fear and everything you hold dear
Even the book in your pocket
You are the sun and the light, you are the freedom I fight
God will do nothing to stop it

The origin is you
You're the origin of love

Love is a drug and you are my cigarette
Love is addiction and you are my Nicorette
Love is a drug like chocolate, like cigarettes
I'm feeling sick, I've got to medicate myself

Well, if God is a priest and the devil a slut
Well, that's a reason for nothing
Like every word that you preach
Like every word that you teach
With every rule that you breach

You know, the origin is you

From the air I breathe to the love I need
Only thing I know, you're the origin of love
From the God above to the one I love
Only thing that's true, the origin is you

From the air I breathe to the love I need
Only thing I know, you're the origin of love
From the God above to the one I love
Only thing that's true, the origin is you

Patre nostrum, Deus machismo
Patre Deus, Deus machismo
Dio de Matre, Deus machismo
Deus esso sancto spirito

Like stupid Adam and Eve
They found their love in a tree
God didn't think they deserved it
He taught them hate, taught them pride
Gave them a leave, made them hide
Let's push the stories aside

You know, the origin is you

From the air I breathe to the love I need
Only thing I know, you're the origin of love
From the God above to the one I love
Only thing that's true, the origin is you

From the air I breathe to the love I need
Only thing I know, you're the origin of love
From the God above to the one I love
Only thing that's true, the origin is you

Some love's pain and some love is a candy cane
It tastes so sweet but leaves you feeling sick with pain
Your love is air, I breathe it in around me
Don't know it's there but without it I'm drowning

Love, you're the origin of love
Eh, oh, le, oh, la

You're the origin of love, love, love, love, love
You're the origin of love, love, love, love, love
You're the origin of love, love, love, love, love
You're the origin of love, love, love, love, love
You're the origin of love, love, love, love, love

Thank God that you found me
Thank God that you found me
Thank God that you found me
