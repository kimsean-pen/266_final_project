Is there a cure for this pain?
Maybe i, i should have something to eat
Food wont take, this emptiness away
Im hungry, for you, my love

Well I've made it through another day
In my cold room
On scraps and pieces, left behind
I survive on the memory of you

All of me, is all for you
You're all i see
All of me, is all for you
You're all i need

Is there a remedy for waiting?
For loves victorious return
Is there a remedy for hating?
Every second that i'm without you

All of me, is all for you

You're all i see
All of me, is all for you
You're all i need

All this life
Is all for love
Its the only road i'll choose
And every street and avenue
Only one will lead me to you
All of me, is all for you
You're all i see
All of me, is all for you
You're all i need
One love, one love, one love x2
One love
