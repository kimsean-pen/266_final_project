She's bought a hat like princess marina's
To wear at all her social affairs
She wears it when she's cleaning the windows
She wears it when she's scrubbing the stairs
But you will never see her at ascot
She can't afford the time or the fare
But she's bought a hat like princess marina's
So she don't care

He's bought a hat like anthony eden's
Because it makes him feel like a lord
But he can't afford a rolls or a bentley
He has to buy a secondhand ford
He tries to feed his wife and his family
And buy them clothes and shoes they can wear
But he's bought a hat like anthony eden's
So he don t care

Buddy can you spare me a dime
My wife is getting hungry
And the kids are crying
This poverty is hurting my pride
Buddy can you spare me, buddy can you spare me a dime

She's bought a hat like princess marina's
And her neighbors think it suits her a treat
But she hasn't any food in the larder
Nor has anybody else in the street
But to look at her you'd think she was wealthy
'cos she smiles just like a real millionaire
'cos she's bought a hat like princess marina's
So she don't care, she don't care, she don't care, she don't care
