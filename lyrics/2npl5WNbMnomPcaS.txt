You don't know and you won't,
Arizona you burned my throat,
you were loyal to a fault but I know I left a lot of it all with you,
I was so passive when you left Maryland,
you don't know and you won't,
Arizona you burned my throat,
you were loyal to a fault but I know I left a lot of it all with you,
I was blood red and I can't mend it,
but I found peace,
I ran away,
it's a hard pull to swallow,
it's a hard truth to tell and take,
you don't know and you won't,
Arizona you burned my throat,
you were loyal to a fault but I know I left that rust sky with you,
I wish I knew the way you viewed me when I withdrew,
Was it preferred or just used to?
I know I used you,
you don't know and you won't,
Arizona you burned my throat,
you were loyal to a fault but I know I left a lot of it all with you,
I wish I knew the way you viewed me when I withdrew,
was it preferred or just used to? I know I used you,
I found peace when I ran away,
I tied you to a state and found the sea,
the frozen water warmer than the blistering dry heat.You don't know and you won't,
