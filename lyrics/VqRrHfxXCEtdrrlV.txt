You wore that white sundress
Smoked a clove cigarette
Danced barefoot and your hair was a mess
You drove a Jeep Cherokee, but no money for gas
Coulda looked at you all day long, all day long

You tried to downplay your beauty but you couldn't fool me
You tried to play like you're tough but you grew up by the beach
Said you hated the world, but somehow you like me
Coulda looked at you all night long, all night long
Coulda looked at you all night long, all night long

How can I forget you in the morning?
How can I forget you?
I was dreamin' you were standin' there wearin' my t-shirt
Wishin' that you could still be here
How can I forget?

I can't
I can't (I can't)
How can I forget?
I can't
I can't

Ran ten blocks in the rain girl
Train ain't running this late girl
You're the only one to do me like that
Why you biting on your lip like that (don't stop)
Fallin' through that door way
Stopping this, ain't no way
Okay, smoke break
I shut my eyes for a second you were gone, gone, gone
Now I'm thinking bout you all night long, all night long

How can I forget you in the morning?
How can I forget you?
I was dreamin' you were standin' there wearin' my t-shirt
Wishin' that you could still be here
How can I forget?

I can't
I can't (I can't)
How can I forget
I can't
I can't

You wore that white sundress
Smoked a clove cigarette
Danced barefoot and your hair was a mess
Let you slip through my fingers, but you're stuck in my head
And I'll be thinkin' 'bout ya for so long
For so long

How can I forget you in the morning?
How can I forget you?
I was dreamin' you were standin' there wearin' my t-shirt
Wishin' that you could still be here
How can I forget?

I can't
I can't
How can I forget?
I can't
I was dreamin' you were standin' there wearin' my t-shirt
Wishin' that you could still be here
How can I forget?

I can't
I can't
How can I forget?
I can't
I can't
How can I forget?
