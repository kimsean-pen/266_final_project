I see you in the sky
A million miles away
I'd love to fly right up to you
See your beautiful star, close up
A star like yours is one in a million
One of those very special things
But if I'm to get to see this beautiful thing so close
I need my chocolate wings

I need my chocolate wings
To fly up to your stars
Give me my chocolate wings
Or our love won't go too far, go too far...

But you won't give me these things that I need
Yet I'd do anything for you
I've waited so long for this moment to come
I think it's time, don't you?
So if you don't let me see your guiding light
That star that shines so bright
I guess somebody else just might
I guess, my darling, this is goodnight...
