Lover, Lover, why do you push
Why do you push, why do you push
Baby, Baby, did you forget about me
I've been standing at the back of your life
Back row, centre, just above the ice
Please don't ask me how I've been getting off
No, Please don't ask me how I've been getting off
Break my body with the back of your hand
Doesn't make sense from where I stand
Baby, Baby, why you wanna mess it up
Sooner or later, I'll find my place
Find my body, better fix my face
Please don't ask me how I've been getting off
No, Please don't ask me how I've been getting off
It's a fine line between pleasure and pain
You've done it once, you can do it again
Whatever you done don't try to explain
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain
It's all the same, It's all the same,
It's all the same,
