I'm Gonna sell my soul to rock-n-roll, I hope he heres my call
Taking a trip where no one dares to go, gonna taste the unknown

Saints and sinners take your pick, cuz i'm a dirty, dirty dirty, dirty
Badass chick!

I'm going Down, down, down, down, down below, are you coming
With me, are you ready to go, going down, down, down, down all
The way, in a hellevator i refuse to pray!

Now this mornin i am on my way, Angel with a dirty face, it's
Getting hotter and im feeling frill, going down this place!

Saints and sinners take your pick, cuz i'm a dirty, dirty dirty, dirty
Badass chick!

I'm going Down, down, down, down, down below, are you coming
With me, are you ready to go, going down, down, down, down all
The way, in a hellevator i refuse to pray!

Saints and sinners take your pick, cuz i'm a dirty, dirty dirty, dirty
Badass chick!

I'm going Down, down, down, down, down below, are you coming
With me, are you ready to go, going down, down, down, down all
The way, in a hellevator i refuse to pray!
I'm going Down, down, down, down, down below, are you coming
With me, are you ready to go, going down, down, down, down all
The way, in a hellevator i refuse to pray!
