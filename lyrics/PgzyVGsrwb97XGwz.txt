This is a memorial
To honor the long gone
This is a burial
My heaven has gone wrong
Those times we had so long ago
Like yesterday!
I miss 'em so much
I can't let go.
My heart is full of hate
It's bleeding love
Father, I have to say goodbye
to keep myself alive.
I can still see you
you're fading away but
I can still feel you
Though you're drifting away from me
(AWAY FROM ME)
You're drifting away!
This is a memorial
To honor the long gone
This is a burial
My heaven has gone wrong
Are you still here, still in this place?
What's left behind, where is god's grace?
You broke my faith
My heart is full of hate
It's bleeding love father
I have to say goodbye
To keep myself alive
I can still see you
you're fading away but
I can still feel you
Though you're drifting away from me.
(AWAY FROM ME)
You're drifting away!
My heart is aching, that's all I know
Hope is fading, I'll let you go.
My heart is aching, that's all I know
Hope is fading, I'll let you go.
This is a
memorial!
This is a
burial!
This is a
memorial!
This is a
burial!
I can't still see you
you're fading away but
I can (I CAN) still feel you (I CAN FEEL YOU) though you
drifting away from me.
(AWAY FROM ME)
You're drifting away!
