As the chill finally hit your skin
Your accomplice turned you in
Juliet you had your reasons
Migraine hallucinations

Had no way to define
The start and the stop of your Freudian mind
I believed you when you said God told you what to do
But the God inside your head was wrong

Fell in to a passionate clique
Only way to truth is isolation
Patriarch, patriarch tell me what to do
Patriarch, I must follow through

Oh, the light
Shaking on the floor
Speaking tongues of angels
Surely I must be in the right
Oh, this tempest loves to fight

Blood bath on the John Muir trail
And the hiker recalled the tail
Juliet and her friend stood at the edge
Juliet jumped without restraint
Her friend fell back, lost faith
Without a God to blame
