Keep on running
Down that long black road
You'll find sunshine and flowers
And maybe love to behold
Can you keep a secret?
Can you keep a secret?

Keep on reaching
Up for a higher ground
But don't keep on preaching
From that book you found
Can you keep a secret?
Can you keep a secret?

I can play it on an old guitar
You can sing it like a monkey man
Don't speak of soul 'cause you've got none
And all the kids in a funky bar
Dressing down like a bogeyman
If they don't mind and you don't mind
I'm gonna write that in a song

But, can you keep a secret?
But, can you keep a secret?
Keep on reaching
Up for a higher ground
Can you keep a secret?
Keep on reaching
Up for a higher ground
Can you keep a secret?
Keep on reaching
Up for a higher ground
Can you keep a secret?
Keep on reaching
Up for a higher ground

On the cover of a magazine
You wore a face that I've seldom seen
You spilled your guts but you've got none

You're driving round in a beat up car
That you found on the road you run
If they don't mind and you don't mind
I'm gonna write that in a song

Can you keep a secret?
Can you keep a secret?
Can you keep a secret?
Can you keep a secret?
Keep on reaching
Up for a higher ground
Can you keep a secret?
Keep on reaching
Up for a higher ground
Can you keep a secret?
Keep on reaching
Up for a higher ground
Can you keep a secret?
Keep on reaching
Up for a higher ground
Keep on reaching
Up for a higher ground
Keep on reaching
Up for a higher ground
