All the wars we fought
All the love we lost
It won't break us, break us
Never break us

They tried to keep us from staring to the sun
But we're just reaching for the stars
Oh, please forgive me
I'm just trying to find a way home

For you and I we will unite
For you and I we will unite

All the wars we fought
All the love we lost
It won't break us, break us
Never break us

When the lights go out
I will hold you tight
It won't break us, break us
Never break us

It would be easier if I could leave it all behind
But you will never be over for me
A storm is rising but we fight it to the end
You and I we will unite
You and I in the night

All the wars we fought
All the love we lost
It won't break us, break us
It won't break us, break us

When the lights go out
I will hold you tight
It won't break us, break us
Never break us
