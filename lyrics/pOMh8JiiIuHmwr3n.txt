One day of my life.
People are running through the night in sweet confusion.
One day to find what matters and what does not matter in this illusion.

An endless day ends.
An endless rain stops.
Because only your love is lifting me up.
An endless day ends.
An endless rain stops.
Because only your voice is lifting me up.

Stay wet.
My dress is white.
You are holding me.
I am falling in your silence.
Your love is so quiet.
That I am feeling my heart beating just between us.

Life is a race and only love wins.
In emptiness you are giving me wings.
Love is a joy.
Love is a pain.
Love is a girl under the rain.
