I won't be
I didn't will leave
It's a see things
It's what this is

But I've got it
My only witness
I wanna be there
And get forgiveness

To my weakness
I really must confess
I shouldn't see this
But I was helpless

(?) has no pain
But there's no passion
I was afraid there
That this would happen

Did a little thing (?)
Feeling that you'd like to meet (?)
Leaving me (?)
We should really try to live by the moments of desire

(?) waiting for the (?) doll
We just need to roll the way we always roll
Get up (?) baby, you can set this free
Get up on my lovin' we can set this free

We will live without nothing approved
You really give me (?)
Get to me you get nothing to loose
Get the love that you showing
Make a move without making a move
A little latin go there
Tingle little tinkerbell
I gotta let you know it
We will live without nothing approved
I think I am feeling better
Get to me you get nothing to loose
Just without (?) together
Make a move without making a move
Nothing lasts forever
Dig a little deeper babe
It's like a delicate (?)

Dig a little deeper baby
When it's (?)
Feeling you like (?) you really are my (?)
Believe in me, you get nothing to lose
You get the feeling that make you go higher
We should really try to live by the moments of desire

Take me to a holy man
(?) place his hand
Every cat saws only (?)
I am ready for a higher love

I am just saying that you understand
Let the shame and (?) us by the hand
It will work out just the way that it was planned
I am ready for the higher love
On and on
Oh let's go violet
Throw ourselves before love
I can see the that you are (?)
On and on
But it still rumbles on
It will rumble
This is how (?)
Until I die
This is how (?)
This is how (?)

As the pressure feels
Erupt these (?)
As the pressure feels
Erupt these (?)
As the pressure mounts
Oh, deconstruct these
Oh I am in (?)
Our resistance
And you put still fine
To a narrow mind
Something to connect to
Something to connect to
I am unexpressed
Something to connect to
Something to connect to
Just what I am feeling
Something to connect to
Something to connect to
I run out high (?)
Something to connect to
Something to connect to
I run out high (?)
(?) something to hold on to
Something to connect to
I run out high (?)
Something to connect to
Something to connect to
I run out high (?)

On and on
Here it is
I am from myself on love
Until I die
I kiss myself
Away for love
I overcome
Away for these
My biggest rumble
Away for kiss
From (?)
Away for love
I mantain
Away
Our resistance
Away for a kiss
Away ay
For a narrow mind
I am unexpressed
Away
My time

Here it is
I
