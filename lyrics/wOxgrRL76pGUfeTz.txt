I fall asleep in my own tears
I cry for the the world, for everyone
And I build a boat to float in
I'm floating away

I can't recall last time I opened my eyes to see the world as beautiful
And I built a cage to hide in
I'm hiding, I'm trying to battle the night

Let love conquer your mind
Warrior, warrior
Just reach out for the light
Warrior, warrior
I am a warrior
Warrior, warrior
I am a warrior
Warrior, warrior of love

I stand behind the wall of people and thoughts, mind controlling
And I hold a sword to guide me
I'm fighting my way

I can't recall the last time I opened my eyes to see the world as beautiful
And I built a cage to hide in
I'm hiding, I'm trying to battle the night

Let love conquer your mind
Warrior, warrior
Just reach out for the light
Warrior, warrior
I am a warrior
Warrior, warrior
I am a warrior
Warrior, warrior of love

Underneath darkened skies
There's a light kept alight

Love conquer your mind
Warrior, warrior
Just reach out for the light
Warrior, warrior
I am a warrior
Warrior, warrior
I am a warrior
Warrior, warrior
Warrior of love
Warrior of love
Warrior of love
