It's too late to fix this.
What's the point?
This is all so pointless.
Sorry I tried so hard.
Just next time that I see you,
just remind me not to act just like I care.
All those memories you killed.
You're just burning bridges you helped build.
And everything that I say,
I hope it brings you back to that one day.
All I have left to do is to just keep
reminding myself to forget about you.
