Four years to dust
Lost animals, animals
Days folded down inanimate, animate

Down and out
Winding up my baby for show
I don't know, did I kill them, maybe?

Still
I am bound
And still
I am bound
Justice come swift

Words to ignore
A better love (better love)
Men to forgive
Never an animal (animal)

??? of red
Streams of red vapour spew out
Can't you hear the sirens of the rhythm?

Still
I am bound
And still
I am bound
And still

Witness for Vincent
Not for your eyes
???
