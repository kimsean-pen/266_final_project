I know you so well, so well
I'm nothing without her
I keep falling
I've been pretty
I know you so well, so well
I'm nothing without her
I keep falling
I've been pretty
I know you so well, so well
I'm nothing without her
I keep falling
I've been pretty
I know you so well, so well
I'm nothing without her
I keep falling
I've been pretty
I know you so well, so well
I'm nothing without her
I keep falling

I've been pretty impatient, I've been pretty impatient over her
Ooh, I've been pretty impatient, over her, ooh
Impatient, I've been pretty impatient, over her
Ooh, I've been pretty impatient, over her

I know you so well
I know you
I'm nothing without her
Without you
