My head, my poor head
Well, it had a direction but the way has changed
On-going, reborn
With the safeness in the city or the hug of a hun
Not dead, but it's gone
Like the widows going crazy for the men they have adored
But frantic, tensely
In a state of agitation with the anger at a clog
At a clog
Polite with sadness
So I gotta go to college or my mother's getting sick
Say no to madness
If you wanna steal the vegetables you better get 'em quick
No, no surrender
Though now everyone is dying I will give myself a chance
This precious tension
I will show I'm not a failure, I will meet you in the end
In the end
I'm waiting
This burden will pass
I know now
I'm not interested anymore
In feeling bad
Good disposition
Everyday I put aside a little time for my own sake
Preserving my head
Now I got a kind of balance I will keep it like it takes
Stop thinking backwards
If I'm anchored to these worries how to get free from this weight?
Of course I mean it
I don't want a bunch of problems, only rest another day
Another day
I'm waiting
This burden will pass
I know now
I'm not interested anymore
In feeling bad
I'm looking for the time
When we all could live
Without our mothers' love
And standing
On my own two feet
For the very very first time
I'm waiting
This burden will pass
I know now
I'm not interested anymore
I'm not interested anymore
I say that I'm not interested anymore
In feeling bad
