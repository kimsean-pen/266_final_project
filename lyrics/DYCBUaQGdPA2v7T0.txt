Sorry I don't really see this working out
It's nothing you did
I just can't do this right now

No easy way to say this and I don't know how
It's nothing you did
But here goes lettin' your heat down

Baby you so perfect
But he's the perfect one for me
I know that you're worth it
But something 'bout him gets to me
Gets to me
All I need
'Cause we got history

I used to love him, he used to love me
Yeah we go way way way way back
We love love love like that
Now I still love him and he still loves me
Yeah we go way way way way back
We love love love like that
(go way way way way way way way way back)

I didn't know it felt the way it did before
It's nothing I did
But now I guess I'm sure

It's like we never really ever closed that door
It's nothing we did
But now our hearts want more

Baby you so perfect
But he's the perfect one for me
I know that you're worth it
But something 'bout him gets to me
Gets to me
All I need
'Cause we got history

I used to love him, he used to love me
Yeah we go way way way way back
We love love love like that
Now I still love him and he still loves me
Yeah we go way way way way back
We love love love like that
(go way way way way way way way way back)

Baby you so perfect
But he's the perfect one for me
I know that you're worth it
But something 'bout him gets to me
Gets to me
All I need
'Cause we got history

I used to love him, he used to love me
Yeah we go way way way way back
We love love love like that
Now I still love him and he still loves me
Yeah we go way way way way back
We love love love like that
I used to love him, he used to love me
Yeah we go way way way way back
We love love love like that
Now I still love him and he still loves me
Yeah we go way way way way back
We love love love like that
Yeah we go way way way way way way way way back
