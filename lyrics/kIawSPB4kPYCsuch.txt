This house is like Russia
With eyes cold and grey
You got me moving in a circle
I dyed my hair red today
I just want a little passion
To hold me in the dark
I know I've got some magic
Buried, buried deep in my heart, yes

But my priest says
You ain't saving no souls
My father says
You ain't making any money
My doctor said
You just took it to the limit
And here I stand
With this sword in my hand
You can say it one more time
What you don't like
Let me hear it one more time then
Have a seat while I

Take to the sky

Gonna take to the sky
My heart is like the ocean

It gets in the way
So close to touching freedom

Then I hear the guards call, call my name
And my priest says
You ain't saving no souls
My father says
You ain't making any money
My doctor said
You just took it to the limit
And here I stand
With this sword in my hand
You can say it one more time

What you don't like
Let me hear it one more time then
Have a seat while I

Take to the sky
Gonna take to the sky
If you no don't like me just a little, well
Why do you hang around?
If you no don't like me just a little, well
Why do you hang around
If you no don't like me just a little, well
Why do you, you take it take it take it, boy
Ah, why do you take it, boy
'Cause this this this house, boy
This this house, boy
This this house, now
Our, our house, boy
Is like, is like, is like, is like
This house is like Russia
With eyes cold and grey
You got me moving in a circle
I dyed my hair red today
But my priest says
You ain't saving no souls
My father says
You ain't making any money
My doctor said
You just took it to the limit
And here I stand with this sword in my hand
You can say it one more time
Come on then
You can say it one more time
Come on now
You can say it one more time
What you don't like
Let me hear it one more time then
Have a seat while I
Take to the sky
Gonna take to
Take, take to the, take to, take to
Take to, take to
Take to
Take to, take to
Take to, take to, take to
Take to
Take to
Take to
Take to, take to
Take to the sky, yeh
Take to, to the sky
Here I go again
Take it again and again
Take it and again
Take it again and again
Take it again, go and I feel
I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I feel the earth move under my feet
And she's calling me out, calling me out
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down now
I feel my earth move under my feet
She's calling me out, I said, she's
Take me to, take to the sky the sky
Take to, take to, take to the sky
Take me to, know boy, you take to the sky, I said, I said take to the sky
