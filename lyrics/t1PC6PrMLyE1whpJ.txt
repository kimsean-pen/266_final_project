Eternal life is now on my trail
Got my red glitter coffin, man
Just need one last nail
While all these ugly gentlemen play out their foolish games
There's a flaming red horizon that screams our names
And as your fantasies are broken in two
Did you really think this bloody road would pave the way for you?
You better turn around
And blow your kiss hello to life eternal, Angel

Racist angry men, what have you done?
Man, you've made a killer of your unborn son
Crown my fear your king at the point of a gun
All I want to do is love everyone

And as your fantasies are broken in two
Did you really think this bloody road would pave the way for you?
You better turn around
And blow your kiss hello to life eternal

Oh

There's no time for hatred
Only questions
Where is love?
Where is happiness?
What is life?
Where is peace?

When will I find the strength to bring me release?
And tell me where is the love in what your prophet has said?
Man, It sounds to me just like a prison for the walking dead
And I've got a message for you and your twisted hell
You better turn around and blow your kiss goodbye
To life eternal Angel
Angel
