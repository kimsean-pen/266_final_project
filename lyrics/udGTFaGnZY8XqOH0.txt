Am I telling myself the truth?
I'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless
Am I doing this right by you?
I seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else

So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom

Am I changing my mind again?
All this indecision makes me shift my focus
Is the tension my only friend?
Anxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless
Am I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?
It makes me lose my self-control
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else

So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom

Am I telling myself the truth about my
self-esteem and how others place their worth in me?
I'm staring through the eyes of someone else
Am I telling myself the truth?

So I'll keep on smiling on the surface
Hiding my nerves behind the curtain
I'm caught up in an empty room
Filled with second thoughts and gloom

Yeah, I'll keep on smiling on the surface
(Am I telling myself the truth?)
