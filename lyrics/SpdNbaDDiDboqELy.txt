It seems the day that your house burned to the ground
Was the day that you'd always planned to leave anyway
And the vast empire you come through to get here
Makes the world look like pennies in my hand
I'll never let go, I'll never let go you said out loud
I'll never let go, I'll never let go you shouted out
Your words shook me right out of a daydream
I was lost somewhere cold and it looked haunted
I was asking strangers but no one understood me
I was drenched in sweat when your words came to me
I'll never let go, I'll never let go you said out loud
I'll never let go, I'll never let go you shouted out

It was the last highway you would ever travel
The long road from a daughter, wife and son
When the bus stopped a beat from California
Your tired feet they ached over the road
I'll never let go, I'll never let go you said out loud
I'll never let go, I'll never let go you shouted out
I'll never let go, I'll never let go you said out loud
I'll never let go, I'll never let go you shouted out
