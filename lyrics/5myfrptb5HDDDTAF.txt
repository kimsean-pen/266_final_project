Hey ladies, get gassin
I'ma gas like the cops aint commin
Top down, music loud who's talkin?
Can't hear haters Blasé Blasé
Go crazy, get money

Throwin down like no one taught me
Can't hear haters Blasé Blasé

Ooo bitch, I'm here and I'm back on
If you thought my first, was my last song
Face the fact man,
You couldn't be more wrong
I'm takin shots from the top like I'm King Kong
Gassed out with my hair sleeked back
Got more bitches than a pimp named slick back
She aint bleedin like she bout to have a heart attack
She on the Dro and she couldn't even handle that
Lay back, you're coughing up a lung or two
Man I can't explain what this gas might do to you
The crew knew, yea I know it's new to you
Come through I can't teach you a thing or two

She told me I'm the fliest she ever met
That's weird cuz she aint even grown yet
Moet Moet, the top off
She in the bathroom tryna take her top off
One, eight, seven, two, eleven
We do numbers
They say Kreayshawn killed the whole damn summer
What a bummer, it's sad for you hating bitches
Better watch your chains when I get close bitches
In my business, girl I welcome you
Wanna be my best friend? girl you gotta show to prove
What's it do?, we mobbin on a Saturday
Fuck the first day, everyday we getting payed

Yes, I'm beautiful, I'm gorgeous
No you can't afford this
You driving in a Ford bitch
Glorious, my whole crew iced out
We melt flames, them other bitches bow down
It's time now, she said to bring the gas out
'Bout to turn the flame on
And burn the whole house down
More money more money, I spend it right
Them dudes lame' they tryna come spend the night
I'm out here in the sky like a star hoe
You on the floor tryna pay up a car note
Real shit, don't harm me I'm never fake
I'm in the 90's you can call me Ricky lake
Ricky Lake
