We're the day birds
Deciding to fly against the sky
Within our dreams, we all wake up
To kiss the ones who are born to die
We're the greying herds
Hurting each other with our lives
Within our dreams, we all wake up
To kiss the ones who are born...
Born to die (born to die)

The drum fish, they beached themselves in hara-kiri
The blackbirds, they fell in thousands from the sky
The red wings streaming down from the higher seas
Deflected by the ground

They crowned the sun
They crowned the sun (they crowned the sun)
They crowned the sun (they crowned the sun)
But I believe that they are free
When their time was done (their time was done)
They were drowned by the only One (they crowned the sun)
But I believe that they are free
Washed by the sun

Our statues
The soaring edifice of our times
Detracted from the ways of the wise
The future will view all history as a crime
So father, tell us when is the time to rise

They crowned the sun (they crowned the sun)
They crowned the sun (they crowned the sun)
But I believe that they are free
When their time was done (their time was done)
They were drowned by the only One (they crowned the sun)
But I believe that they are free

We're the day birds
Deciding to fly against the sky
Within our dreams, we all wake up
To kiss the ones who are born to die
We're the greying herds
Hurting each other with our lives
Within our dreams, we all wake up
To kiss the ones who are born...
Born to die

They crowned the sun (they crowned the sun)
They crowned the sun (they crowned the sun)
But I believe that they are free
When their time was done (their time was done)
They were drowned by the only One (they crowned the sun)
But I believe that they are free
They crowned the sun (they crowned the sun)
They crowned the sun (they crowned the sun)
But I believe that they are free
And we believe that they are free
'Cause I believe that they are me
Washed by the sun
