Can you keep a secret?
Honestly, no?
If I know a good story,
that bubbles out of me,
like weeds from the ground.

Can you keep a secret?
Ok I will try.
But sooner or later,
the vulcanus crater,
will erupt again.

Erupt, erupt, erupt again.
Erupt, erupt, erupt again.

I can't keep it inside.

Can you keep a secret?
What choice do I have?
The door that you've opened,
the seal that you've broken,
you cannot shut now.

Can you keep a secret?
Well, why do you ask?
It's clear from the gallery,
you're dying to tell me,
what's been going on.

You can't keep it inside.
You can't keep it inside.
You can't keep it inside.
