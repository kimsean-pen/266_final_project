I'm the apocalypse
with a fat lip(?)
I never did and I still don't give a shit
I'm such an outcast
you swore I'll never last
I got news for you
This ain't my last dance
This ain't my last dance
I've given it all
I've given everything for you
I've given you all
What more do you want me to do?
I've taken the fall
I've given everything to you
I've given my all
Will it ever be enough for you?
I am your nemesis
I don't regret this
I wrote the fucking book with no consensus
wanna live fast?
You said I'll never last
let me say it again
this ain't my last dance
This ain't my last dance
I've given it all
Ive given everything for you
I've given you all
What more do you want me to do?
I've taken the fall
I've given everything to you
I've given my all
Will it ever be enough for you?
I won't say it wrong
It comes together now
falls together now
I won't say I'll wait
But it falls together now
comes together now
This ain't my last dance
I've given it all
I've given everything for you
I've given you all
What more do you want me to do?
I've taken the fall
I've given everything to you
I've given my all
Will it ever be enough for you?
This ain't my last dance.
