I'm holdin' on your rope
got me 10 feet off the ground
I'm hearing what you say
but I just can't nake a sound
but tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
but wait
You tell me that your sorry
didn't think I'd turn around
and say
That it's too late to apologize
it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
it's too late
I'd take another chance
take a shot
take a fall for you
And I need you
like a heart needs a beat
but that's nothing new. Yeah
I loved you with a fire red
now it's turning blue
And you say
sorry like the angel
heaven let me think was you
and I'm afraid
It's too late to apologize
it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
it's too late
woah oh woah
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
yeah
I said it's too late to apologize
yeah
I'm holdin' on your rope
got me 10 feet off the ground
