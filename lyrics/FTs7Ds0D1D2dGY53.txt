Why don't you tell me
what do you need?
There is a blank page
for you
Give me the bones of what you believe
Maybe they'll save you from me

Will I be the strong hand
keeping you safe
or will I break you in half
and you will never
be under my thumb
but you were not your
own land

See the way we all run
When we know it off by heart
Played down, waiting all out
When we win or lose it this time

When the pressure's building
for a great white hope
do you give up the things that you love
and the pressure's building
till it takes you whole
can you go back on your own word

All of your brothers
they never died
For what you kill for
slowly
How it will grind you
into the ground
If you should try to
hold me

See the way we all run
When we know it off by heart
Played down, waiting all out
When we win or lose it this time

When the pressure's building
for a great white hope
do you give up the things that you love
and the pressure's building
till it takes you whole
can you go back on your own word

When the pressure's building
for a great white hope
do you give up the things that you love
and the pressure's building
till it takes you whole
can you go back on your own word
