I remember the clouds in the summer
And how the light kissed my eyes
When I was a child it was always this
A life that I left behind
Remember the sun, remember the rain
They're never gonna touch me again tonight
Cover my eyes tonight
Don't let me see the light
Forever the cold of the winter
Forever the moon in my eyes
Now that you're here it is always this
I fall to the night and the sky
Forever I crawl, forever I cry
I don't know who I am anymore tonight
Cover my eyes tonight
Don't let me see the light
All that we are, we're never the same
All that we notice, all that remains
Remember the sun, remember the rain
They're never gonna touch me again tonight
Don't let me see the light
Don't let me see the light
