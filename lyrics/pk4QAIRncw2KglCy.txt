Brace yourself

Brace yourself
...
Your last chance
last summer

Your last dance
Beating your own drummer
Go out fighting
Go out young

A flash of lightning
Eclipse sun
Your last chance
last summer

Your last dance
Beating your own drummer
Go out fighting
Go out young

A flash of lightning
Eclipse sun

Brace yourself

Brace yourself

Brace yourself
Brace yourself
Brace yourself for the grand finale
...
Your last chance
last summer
Your last dance
Beating your own drummer
Go out fighting
Go out young
A flash of lightning
Eclipse sun
Brace yourself
Brace yourself
