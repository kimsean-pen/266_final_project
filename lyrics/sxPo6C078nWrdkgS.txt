Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

For love may come and tap you on the shoulder
Some starless night
Just in case you feel you wanna' hold her
You'll have a pocketful of starlight

Catch a falling star and (Catch a falling) put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away (Never let it fade away)
Catch a falling star and (Catch a falling) put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day (Save it for a rainy day)

For love may come and tap you on the shoulder
Some starless night
And just in case you feel you wanna hold her
You'll have a pocketful of starlight
(pocketful of starlight) (Hmmm-mm-mm)

Catch a falling star and (Catch a falling) put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away (Never let it fade away)
Catch a falling star and (Catch a falling) put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day (Save it for a rainy day)
(Save it for a rainy, rainy rainy day)

For when your troubles starting multiplying
And they just might
It's easy to forget them without trying
With just a pocketful of starlight

Catch a falling star and (Catch a falling) put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away (Never let it fade away)
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

(Save it for rainy day!) Save it for a rainy day
