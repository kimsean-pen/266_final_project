Roses in my hair
Roses in the yard
I can see the people in their places on the lawn

Dazzling in white
Blindingly alone
In and out of strangers I am floating like a ghost

Then ooh ooh ooh
Suddenly I'm dissociating
Then ooh ooh ooh
Out of body, out of mind
Out of mind, oh no—

And I I I
Am done with my perfect
Done with my perfect lies
And I I I
Am done with the perfect
Am one with the perfect bride

Fizzing through my blood
Trying to fight it down
Paralyzed and lidded I am mumbling the sounds
I can feel the boil
Poison chemicals
Buzzing in my body trying to wrestle for control

Then ooh ooh ooh
Suddenly I'm dissociating
Then ooh ooh ooh
Out of body, out of mind
Out of mind, oh no—

And I I I
Am done with my perfect
Done with my perfect lies
And I I I
Am done with the perfect
Am one with the perfect bride

Da-du-dah-da da-da-da-da
Da-du-dah-da da
Da-du-dah-da da-da-da-da
Da-du-dah-da da
Da-du-dah-da da-da-da-da
Da-du-dah-da da

Roses in my hair
Dazzling in white
Dress me up in ribbons just to wake under the knife

Then ooh ooh ooh
Suddenly I'm dissociating
Then ooh ooh ooh
Out of body, out of mind
Out of mind, oh no—

And I I I
Am done with my perfect
Done with my perfect lies
And I I I
Am done with the perfect
Am one with the perfect bride

Da-du-dah-da da-da-da-da
Da-du-dah-da da
Da-du-dah-da da-da-da-da
Da-du-dah-da da
Da-du-dah-da da-da-da-da
Da-du-dah-da da
