Running under cover of the moonlight
Shadow death row.At the night we're
Running wild with no hope for tomorrow...
No tomorrow!
As we're walking through the fire

That burns within us all. If ya wanna take
A glance to the blaze of pain
You'll never be the same
You wanna get closer and get a taste of death?
I know ya wanna fuck me down 'til I'm bleeding red

I couldn't care less, I'll end up rotting in the mud
So c'mon mothafucka and gimme yer best shot.
You really thought you'd see through what
I am and what I need
We are children of rebellion, we'll fight, we'll bleed
Don't try to come to preach over us and over me

We're Children of Decadence
We're right, we're real, we will fight, we'll bleed
We're mothafucking dying breed
We're slowly dying
All wrecked and fucked I wonder if this is the way I'm supposed to go
But that is all I ever got that is all I'll ever get so I just let it go.
As we're walking through the fire
That burns within us all

If ya wanna take a glance to the blaze of pain
You'll never be the same
You wanna get closer and get a taste of death?
I know ya wanna fuck me down 'til I'm bleeding red

I couldn't care less, I'll end up rotting in the mud

So c'mon mothafucka and gimme yer best shot.

You really thought you'd see through what

I am and what I need

We are children of rebellion, we'll fight, we'll bleed
Don't try to come to preach over us and over me
We're Children of Decadence
We're right, we're real, we will fight, we'll bleed
We're mothafucking dying breed
We're slowly dying
You wanna get closer and get a taste of death?
I know ya wanna fuck me down 'til I'm bleeding red
I couldn't care less, I'll end up rotting in the mud
So c'mon mothafucka and gimme yer best shot.
You really thought you'd see through what

We're mothafucking dying breed
