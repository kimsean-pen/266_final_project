When the quest is over and the battles won
There's a lamper to the south where we go to have some fun
The wenches they are plenty, the alcohol is free
The party lasts all through the night and the alcohol is free

Tonight we drink together
Tomorrow we may die

Yo ho Mexico
Far to the south where the cactus grow
Tequila and a donkey show
Mexico, Mexico
Yo ho Mexico
Far to the south where the cactus grow
Take me away from the ice and the snow
Let's go to Mexico

A pirates life is simple
We drink and steal and kill

While we are questing
in search for bigger thrills
We sail across the ocean we're drunk in many bars
But when we sail to Mexico thats when we party hard

Tonight we drink together
Tomorrow we may die

Yo ho Mexico
Far to the south where the cactus
grow
Tequila and a donkey show
Mexico
Mexico
Yo ho Mexico
Far to the Suns where the cactus grow
Take me away from the ice and the snow
Let's go to Mexico

Yo ho Mexico
Far to the south where the cactus
grow
Tequila and a donkey show
Mexico
Mexico
Yo ho Mexico
Far to the Suns where the cactus grow
Take me away from the ice and the snow
Free margaritas and a taco
Let's go to Mexico
