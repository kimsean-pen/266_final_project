You seem to circle miles above me
Never hearing any word I say
Eyes reeling from deadly pleasure
The last second don't count anyway

Without this safety net you're free
To find serene pleasure of speed

A blur of beauty, intoxicating
Existence outstripped, outshined
Head clear cold chassis shaking
Encounter of body and mind

Erupting violent machine
Precise exultance so serene

Poised risk and calculation
Kind of wide awake alert daze
Pretty pirouette accelerating
Beyond living in so many ways

Without the safety net you're free
To find serene pleasure of speed
Erupting violent machine
Precise exultance so serene
