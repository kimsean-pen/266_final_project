A system of complete control, the pressure builds
It wraps its hands around your throat
A constant battle
A silent war of mind and soul

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get up, get up
One life, one shot
Give it all you got
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get up, get up
Keep the flame alive

Hope for the hopeless
A light in the darkness
Hope for the hopeless
A light in, a light in the dark

The chains set to break your soul, day by day
You know the choice you have to make
Freeze up and fade
Or be the flame that lights the way

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get up, get up
One life, one shot
Give it all you got
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get up, get up
Keep the flame alive

Hope for the hopeless
A light in the darkness
Hope for the hopeless
You've got one life, one shot
Give it all you got

Ill's got a vice grip like ice running down your spine
This world, it's got you in its sights

Rise, rise, rise, rise
It's all or nothing
Rise, rise, rise, rise
It's do or die
Rise, rise, rise

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get up, get up
One life, one shot
Give it all you got
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get up, get up
Keep the flame alive

Hope for the hopeless
A light in the darkness
Hope for the hopeless
A light in the dark
We stand for the faithless and the broken
Hope for the hopeless
A light in, a light in the dark
