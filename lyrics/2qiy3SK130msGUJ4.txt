Rain falls, staring out the window at a
Blank sky, waiting for a sign
Only you, only you
Could find the truth, find the truth
Yeah only you, can cross that line

Everyone wants to change
Everybody's got to play that game
Everyone wants to change
Everybody's got to break that chain

Play that game
Break that chain
You've got to play that game
Break that chain
Play that game
Break that chain
You've got to play that game
Everyday

It's your turn, rules meant to be broken
So get on up, what you've got to lose?
Only you, only you
Can make it through, make it through
Yeah only you, can cross that line

Everyone wants to change
Everybody's got to play that game
Everyone wants to change
Everybody's got to break that chain

Play that game
Break that chain
You've got to play that game
Break that chain
Play that game
Break that chain
You've got to play that game
Everyday

We'll find a way
We'll find a way

Everyone wants to change
Everybody's got to play that game
Everyone wants to change
Everybody's got to play that game

(It's your turn, rules meant to be broken
So get on up, what you've got to lose?)

Play that game
Break that chain
You've got to play that game
Break that chain
Play that game
Break that chain
You've got to play that game
Everyday

Everyone wants to change
Everybody's got to play that game
Everyone wants to change
Everybody's got to break that chain
