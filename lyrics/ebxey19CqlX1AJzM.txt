I never thought I'd wanna die,
But I was looking For a gun
On a cold night Then you found me.

God help me,
Because I feel you drifting.
You're drifting a little,
And I'm scared.

And I hope time
Doesn't change him.
I hope time
Doesn't change him.
I hope time
Doesn't change him.
I hope time
Doesn't change him.

When you hold my hand,
Your eyes are looking out the window.
I'm afraid to ask...

So help me
because I feel You drifting.
You're drifting a little,
And I'm scared.

And I hope time
Doesn't change him.
I hope time
Doesn't change him.
I hope time
Doesn't change him.
I hope time
Doesn't change him.

And I hope time
Doesn't change him.
I hope time
Doesn't change him.
I hope time
Doesn't change him.
I hope time
Doesn't change him.
