Tear the righteous from their thrones
Pull the trigger
Cast the stone
Woe is me
Privileged man
Drinking poison
Pushing scams

Polarizer
Thy will be done

Take all the fame
Building your name
The chosen one

A special kind
To take the best
And leave the scraps for lesser kind

And through it all
Dividing those who fuel your ego
Those who fuel your pride

You're the only one in the world

It's just a shot away

I'm sorry that I get away from myself
I'm sorry you thought this was anything else
I'm sorry that I get away
