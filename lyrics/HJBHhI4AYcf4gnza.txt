I saw the widow in the window waving down at me
Heal your bones
I saw the bird circiling above me
Heal your bones
I had a vision of this but so painless
Heal your bones
I opened the book to your birth-page and it said
Heal your bones
I saw
I saw
Heal your bones
Heal your bones
Heal your bones
Heal your bones
Heal your bones
