All the way to grandma's house
I stayed on the narrow path
but my brother wandered off
deep into the wood
bitten twice by rattle snakes
tangled in the poison oak
he fell down and broke his legs
into a great ravine
when I arrived at grandma's house
she had made us tea and cake
she asked me where my brother was
I said I don't know and I ate

When I get to heaven
I'll be greeted warmly
surrounded by the angels
as jesus takes my hand
I'll receive a mansion
on the river Jordan
and a crown made of diamonds
for a race well run
I won't ever lock my doors
I will trust my neighbors
confident that they deserve
to be there in heaven, too
