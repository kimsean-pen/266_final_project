Come on the streets
The death patrol
Taking directives
Death patrol
I know a captor when told takes hold
I told our agent "What do you know?"

That (???)
He's our man
He's our man
He's our man

That (???)
He's our man
He's our man
He's our man

Hold on it's (???)
Hold on it's (???)
Hold on it's (???)
Hold on it's (???)

That (???)
He's our man
He's our man
He's our man

That (???)
He's our man
He's our man
He's our man

That (???)
He's our man
He's our man
He's our man

That (???)
He's our man
He's our man
He's our man

They give directives
And we get captured

Hold on it's (???)
Hold on it's (???)
Hold on it's (???)
Hold on it's (???)

They're on the streets
They're on patrol
Taking directives
Day by day
I know a captor when told takes hold
I told our agent "What do you know?"
What do you know?
