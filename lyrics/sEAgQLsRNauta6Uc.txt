(Aww)
(Yeah)

Here is the money that I owe you
Yeah so you can pay the bills
I will give you more
When I get paid again

I hate those people who love to tell you
Money is the root of all that kills
They have never been poor
They have never had the joy of
a welfare Christmas

(Yeah)
Oh, I know we will never look back
(Yeah)

You say you wake up crying
Yes and you don't know why
You get up and you go lay down inside
My baby's room

Yeah I guess I'm doing okay
I moved in with the strangest guy
Can you believe he actually
Thinks that I am really alive?

I will buy you a garden
Where your flowers can bloom
I will buy you a new car
Perfect shiny and new
I will buy you that big house
Way up in the West Hills
I will buy you a new life
(Yes I will)

Yes, I know all about that other guy
The handsome man with athletic thighs
I know about all the time before
With that obsessive little rich boy

They might make you think you're happy
Yeah maybe for a minute or two
They can't make you laugh
No they can't make you feel
The way that I do

I will buy you a garden
Where your flowers can bloom
I will buy you a new car
Perfect shiny and new
I will buy you that big house
Way up in the West Hills
I will buy you a new life
Yeah
I will buy you a new life

(Oh, yeah)
Ooh, I know we can never look back
(Yeah)
(Oh)

Oh, will you please let me stay the night
Will you please let me stay the night
No one will ever know

I will buy you a garden
Where your flowers can bloom
I will buy you a new car
Perfect shiny and new
I will buy you that big house
Way up in the west hills
I will buy you a new life

I will buy you a garden
Where your flowers can bloom
I will buy you a new car
Perfect shiny and new
I will buy you that big house
Way up in the west hills
I will buy you a new life
I will buy you a new life
