I'm sad and, I'm stressin'
But I'm still out here flexin'
Mixed emotions, fucked up from the potion
Should I just leave or try to fight it
Should I bleed out just so you can find me
Just so you can find me
You got a new man but bitch I got them diamonds
They're bending fucking lighting
I got a loose grip on life, will you save me tonight
I got a tight grip on the knife
On the side of my mind, I am taking your life
Said you worry 'bout me, I worry 'bout me too
Wish you were a noose, grab my neck and call it truce
You hate me
Well bitch, I hate me too
I don't really fuck with life, I'm just in it for a few
You left me
I wouldn't date me too
I'm a lonely piece of shit but the money comin' soon
You hate me
Well bitch, I hate me too
(You hate me
Well bitch, I hate me too)
You left me
I wouldn't date me too
(You left me
I wouldn't date me too)
Gold in my nose
Couple hoes give me dome
Never catch those feels again
I let my guard down at them both
Feel your head on my chest
It's been a while, but I still don't know your bed from my neck
Bitch I wanna die tonight
I'm looking at the sky tonight
(Yeah)
We got things in common
(Oh no no no)
You hate me
Well bitch, I hate me too
I don't really fuck with life, I'm just in it for a few
You left me
I wouldn't date me too
I'm a lonely piece of shit but the money comin' soon
You hate me
Well bitch, I hate me too
(You hate me
Well bitch, I hate me too)
You left me
I wouldn't date me too
(You left me
I wouldn't date me too)
