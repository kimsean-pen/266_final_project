Back in June, I'll pull the plug out
And push the penny in a poem
I am sorry I admit that
Admit that what I did was wrong

I don't wanna get you down
I just need to be around
Treating me so unkind
You're making a milkshake of my mind

In July, I pull the plug out
And watch the water wash away
I get high to dream and pin out
And I get higher everyday

I don't wanna get you down
I just need to be around
Baby, you're so unkind
You're making a milkshake of my mind
You're making a milkshake of my mind
You're making a milkshake of my mind
You're making a milkshake of my mind
You're making a milkshake of my mind
(A milkshake, a milkshake, a milkshake of my mind)
You're making a milkshake of my mind
(A milkshake, a milkshake, a milkshake of my mind)
You're making a milkshake of my mind
(A milkshake, a milkshake, a milkshake of my mind)
You're making a milkshake of my mind
(A milkshake, a milkshake, a milkshake of my mind)
You're making a milkshake of my mind
