You try and keep me out of sight
You try and keep me out of sight and out of mind
Out of mind

You try and keep me from the light
You try and keep me from the light, but I know it's mine
I know it's mine

You're rigging the game
You're part of the system
It shows in the way
That you never listen when I speak
I'm not gonna wait
I've made my decision

And I'm not gonna sit in the dark anymore
No I'm not gonna sit in the dark anymore

You're always telling me I'm not
You're always telling me I'm not, not enough
And I'm enough

You're always turning back the clock
You're always turning back the clock, but time is up
Time is up

You're rigging the game
You're part of the system
It shows in the way
That you never listen when I speak
I'm not gonna wait
I've made my decision

And I'm not gonna sit in the dark anymore
No I'm not gonna sit in the dark anymore

We've taken our knocks
We're not gonna take them anymore
We're not gonna stop
Cause we've seen a world worth fighting for
So ready or not
Together we're kicking down the door

And we're not gonna sit in the dark anymore
No we're not gonna sit in the dark anymore
