Oh baby
Oh man
You're making me crazy
You're really driving me mad
But that's all right with me
It's really no fuss
As long as you're next to me
Just the two of us

You're my, my, my
My kind of woman
My, oh my
What a girl
You're my, my, my

My kind of woman

And I'm down on my hands, and knees
Begging you please baby
To show me your world
Oh brother
Sweetheart
I'm feeling so tired

Really falling apart
And it just don't make sense to me

I really don't know
Why you stick right next to me
Wherever I go
You're my, my, my
My kind of woman
My, oh my
What a girl
You're my, my, my
My kind of woman
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Begging you please baby
To show me your world
