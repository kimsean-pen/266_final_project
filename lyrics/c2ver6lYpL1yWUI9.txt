If I've learnt anything from this,
It would all be gone, it would all be gone
And I'll take away your breath.
Just to turn me on, yeah you turn me on.

Cause' down where the city meets the sea
I sit and daylight speaks to me
She carries me away
Oh yeah...

I'll find my way
Would fall from grace
With the little piece of you that's left in me

But then it's 1, 2, 3 and you're back to me,
And all the pieces fit together oh so perfectly
Enough to take me home
Just take me home...

If I've learnt anything from this,
It would all be gone, it would all be gone
And I'll take away your breath.
Just to turn me on, yeah you turn me on.

We'll find our way
We'll leave this place
With the little piece of me that's left in you

But then it's 1, 2, 3 and you're back to me
And if you hear me loud and clear then what's the problem dear?
Why won't you take me home?

If I've learnt anything from this,
It would all be gone, it would all be gone
And I'll take away your breath.
Just to turn me on, yeah you turn me on.

Down where the city meets the sea
I sit and daylight speaks to me
She carries me away...

Just take me home
Why won't you take me home?

If I've learnt anything from this,
It would all be gone, it would all be gone
And I'll take away your breath.
Just to turn me on, yeah you turn me on.

Down where the city meets the sea
I sit and daylight speaks to me
She carries me away...

Cause' down where the city meets the sea
I sit and daylight speaks to me
Yeah, daylight speaks to me...
