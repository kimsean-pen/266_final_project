All the banners stop waving
And the flags stop flying
And the silence comes over
Thousands of soldiers
Thousands of soldiers

Who is that girl? Do I know her face?
Who is that girl?

Joanni, Joanni wears a golden cross
And she looks so beautiful in her armour
Joanni, Joanni blows a kiss to God
And she never wears a ring on her finger

All the cannon are firing
And the swords are clashing
And the horses are charging
And the flags are flying
And the battle is raging
And the bells, the bells are ringing

Who is that girl? Do I know her face?
Who is that girl?

Joanni, Joanni wears a golden cross
And she looks so beautiful in her armour
Joanni, Joanni blows a kiss to God
And she never wears a ring on her finger
Joanni, Joanni, Joanni, Joanni blows a kiss to God
And she just looks beautiful in her armour
Beautiful in her armour

[French]
Elle parle à Dieu et aux anges
Dans ses prières
Venez Sainte Marguerite
Venez Sainte Catherine
Elle a besoin de vous deux.
Les voix, les voix du feu
Chante avec moi petite soeur,
Les voix, les voix, les voix

[English translation]
She speaks with God and the angels
In her prayers
Come Saint Marguerite
Come Saint Catherine
She needs you two.
Voices, voices of fire
Sing with me little sister,
The voices, the voices, the voices.
