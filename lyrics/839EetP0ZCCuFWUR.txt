you got it
sometimes words are hard to find
i'm looking for that perfect line

to let you know you're always on my mind
yeah, this is love - and i've learned enough to know
i'm never letting go

no, no, no - won't let go
when you want it - when you need it
you'll always have the best of me
i can't help it - believe it

you'll always get the best of me
i may not always know what's right
but i know i want you here tonight

gonna make this moment last for all your life
oh this is love - and it really means so much
i can tell from every touch

no, no, no - can't get enough
when you want it - when you need it
you'll always have the best of me
i can't help it - i believe it

you'll always get the best of me, yeah
oh this is love - and i've learned enough to know
i'm never letting go

no, no, no - won't let go
you'll always have the best of me

you'll always get the best of me
you'll always have the best of me
you'll always get the best of me
oh, when you want it - when you need it
you'll always have the best of me
i can't help it - believe it
you'll always get the best of me
when you want it - when you need it
you'll always have the best of me
i can't help it - believe it
you'll always get the best of me
