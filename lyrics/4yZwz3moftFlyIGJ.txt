Down in a hole there are so many ways
To find yourself some light
It's always the miracles
Keep waiting all you like
Ain't got no time to waste
I know the end is near
And if i run away
I'll always end up here

Walking away
From the things i adore
Telling the truth
For once i'm sure
It's always a sign
When you feel yourself bleed
I'm walking away

From all i need

I can't escape the tragedy
That always brings me down
If i could eliminate
Those things that make me frown
Take all the baggage
That follows me around

And just disintegrate
Burn it to the ground

Walking away
From the things i adore
Telling the truth
For once i'm sure
It's always a sign
When you feel yourself bleed
I'm walking away
From all i need
I walking away
Yeah
Walking away
Yeah
I walking away
From the things i adore
(walking away)
Telling the truth
For once i'm sure
(walking away)
It's always a sign
When you feel yourself bleed
(walking away)
I'm walking away
From all i need
I'm Walking away
