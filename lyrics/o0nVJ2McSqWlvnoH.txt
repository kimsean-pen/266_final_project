It's not how love was meant to be
Broken hearts, broken dreams
I thought love was wild and free
But cupid's played a trick on me
There's nothing left it's time to part
So give me back my heart
The fairytale is dead and gone
Chorus
Love don't live here anymore
A memory and nothing more
Love don't live here
It's gone gone gone
Every part of you replaced
Every memory erased
Love don't live here It's gone gone gone
Had enough of stormy seas
Sleepless nights counting sheep
I need someone who's there for me
To feel alive and let me breathe
Well I thought that you should know
And so I'm letting go And what will be will be
Chorus
Love don't live here anymore
A memory and nothing more
Love don't live here
It's gone gone gone
Every part of you replaced
Every memory erased
Love don't live here It's gone gone gone
Love don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore x2
Don't live here
Love don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore x3
Chorus
Love don't live here anymore
A memory and nothing more
Love don't live here
It's gone gone gone
Every part of you replaced
Every memory erased
Love don't live here It's gone gone gone
Love don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore x6
Don't live here
