Help me, I am freaking and my heart is barely beating,
And the demons, they are creeping around
Take me, I am sinking and my lungs are barely breathing.
As the angels put me into the ground

And everybody's peeking!
No one makes a sound!
The shadows are deceiving!
Paranoid and aroused!

Slap me, I am shaking and my guts are really aching,
The demons, they're laughing out loud
Spare me, I am fading and my will is dissipating,
As the angels put me into the ground

And everybody's peeking!
No one makes a sound!
The shadows are deceiving!
Paranoid and aroused!

My mind is debating,
These lesions I'm making,
This medicines sedating,
The power embracing!

The bullshit I'm facing,
My feelings I'm hating,
Reality is failing,
This shit is degrading!

And everybody's peeking!
No one makes a sound!
The shadows are deceiving!
Paranoid and aroused!

The bullshit I'm facing,
My feelings I'm hating,
Reality is failing,
This shit is degrading!
