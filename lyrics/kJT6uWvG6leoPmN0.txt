When I see you like an ocean girl and my eyes start blurring down
Head high off a Brooklyn Bus with my nerves all tweaking out
Still it feels like paradise when your lips press down so slow
You chew me up and then you spit me out like some gum or tobacco

Got me singing like
I don't know what it is
But your love has got me twisted
Stone cold like I'm a kid
Off my Dad's alcohol cabinet
I'm young and I'm listless
To your love is in my blood
Oh girl, you got me twisted
You got me twisted
You got me twisted

Now I'm tripping all over myself cos I'm stuttering and talking fast
Got the spins I could use some help
But when I ask you just start to laugh
Still it feels like paradise when your lips press down so slow
You so high till you had enough then you cold like an eskimo

Got me singing like
I don't know what it is
But your love has got me twisted
Stone cold like I'm a kid
Off my dad's alcohol cabinet
I'm young and I'm listless
To your love is in my blood
Oh girl, you got me twisted
You got me twisted
You got me twisted
You got me twisted

I don't know what it is
But your love has got me twisted
Stone cold like I'm a kid
Off my dad's alcohol cabinet
I'm young and I'm listless
To your love is in my blood
Oh girl, you got me twisted
Oh girl, you got me twisted
