Ooh I get this feeling in my heart somedays, wuh uh oh,
this kind of feeling doesn't need x-rays,
oh my darlin, darlin, darlin, oh if I knew what to say when we met we could,
but my lips are lockin, lockin, I take a risk when I try to be understood,
I've drawn too close to let go now,

guaranteed chemistry, I'm not lying only dying spending time without you's cheap,
nothing's free, if we meet someday there's never need to change the beat of growing streets,
no place can urbanize our lives, it'd make my night to get to know your way
around the block, I'll leave it up to you

can't help staring when you make it through the rain on time, wuh uh oh,
thunderstormin yet you look just fine,
oh I'm fallin, fallin, fallin, it wouldn't be half as bad if nobody knew,
but I'm staulin, staulin, staulin, oh if I wait anymore I'll be overdue,
got something to compete for you,

guaranteed chemistry, I'm not lying only dying spending time without you's cheap,
nothing's free, if we meet someday there's never need to change the beat of growing streets,
no place can urbanize our lives, it'd make my night to get to know your way
around the block, I'll leave it up to you

ooh, aah,
if arrive before you're gone, and you're right where you belong
inside that warehouse in the loft your family bought,
I have a letter that I wrote, wanna take you out before,
that rotten boy from school comes knockin at your door,
lately I can't get you off my mind, can't get over just how your designed,
since your face I can't help being kind, take my thoughts of you and press rewind,

guaranteed chemistry, I'm not lying only dying spending time without you's cheap,
nothing's free, if we meet someday there's never need to change the beat of growing streets,
no place can urbanize our lives, it'd make my night to get to know your way
around the block, I'll leave it up to you
