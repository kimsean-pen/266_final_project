You feel that seeping through
It's calling back to you
An outline that you made
And nothing else feels quite right

You've been waiting around
For something to change
Leaving it up to fate
Is all the same

You're throwing the stones into water
And none of them make a splash
I'll find it something better
Or leaving behind what's best to lose

You've been waiting around
For something to change
Leaving it up to fate
Is all the same
