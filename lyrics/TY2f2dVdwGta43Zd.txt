Uuuuh uuh wo wo uuhh
I realize but now i love this past
Try so hard to make it last
Feeling upon you
but it seem to fade away
But yet i can hear him say
We did try
Try the best
To make it through those time
Let stop dont go any futher
Cause i need sometimes
Darlin i, noo
You never mend to make me cry
I never understood your reason why
And darlin i, nooo
You never mend to make me cry
This lonely night without you
Is it good bye
uuh
I never though
that i will hear you said
I should go on my own way
Tell me can you see
The changes that you bring me through
I wonder if you really knew
How much try
Try my best to make it through those times
But you say stop dont go any futher
Cause i need more time
Ooh baby
And darlin i, noo
You never mend to make me cry
I never understood your reason why
Ooh
Darlin i, noo
You never mend to make me cry
This lonely night without you
Is it good bye
Good byee
aaah Darlin i, noo
You never mend to make me cry
I never understood you reason why
And darlin i
You never mend to make me cry
Tell why tell why why
Woooo yeaa
