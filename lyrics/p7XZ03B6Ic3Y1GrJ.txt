We should be together
We should be together

You should be with me in the shade, with the breeze blowin' free, life is easy for right now
And I should be with you in the bed, sippin' Kool-Aid, no room for the bullshit for right now

Yeah, we should be together
(We should be together)
Yeah, we should be together, right now
(Oh)
Yeah, we should be together
Yeah, we should be together, right now
(We should be together)
Right now
(We should be together)

More money, more problems, another day, another dollar
Every minute of every hour, you need a break from all that, get away from all that
Take a moment, take a shower, take a shot of this, do it and get into it
I ain't worried 'bout the whole world, I just wanna be your world
All I'm really sayin' is...

You should be with me in the shade, with the breeze blowin' free, life is easy for right right
And I should be with you in the bed, sippin' Kool-Aid, no room for the bullshit for right now

Yeah, we should be together
(We should be together)
Yeah, we should be together, right now
(Oh)
Yeah, we should be together
Yeah, we should be together, right now
(We should be together)
Right now
(We should be together)

No friends, no phone, just a little sex with the Netflix on
We ain't worried if tomorrow gon' come
We escape from all that, take a break from all that
No limits, no laws, take a sip of this, do it and get into it
We ain't worried 'bout the whole world, too caught up with being your world
All I'm really sayin' is...

You should be with me in the shade, with the breeze blowin' free, life is easy for right right
And I should be with you in the bed, sippin' Kool-Aid, no room for the bullshit for right now

Yeah, we should be together
(We should be together)
Yeah, we should be together, right now
(Oh)
Yeah, we should be together
Yeah, we should be together, right now
(We should be together)
Right now
(We should be together, together, together)

Nothing could be better than my here and now
Make it last forever, baby wear it out
We got a little crazy
You can blame it on the Jack, I'll be blaming the Jaimie
I... all I want to do is let it go and get it in with you
We ain't worried 'bout the whole world, too caught up with being your world
All I'm really sayin' is...

You should be with me in the shade, with the breeze blowin' free, life is easy for right right
And I should be with you in the bed, sippin' Kool-Aid, no room for the bullshit for right now
