Weights, the growing stem of time
Waits, poison us outside
You're seconds within mine

Don't memorise the leaves
That cover to deceive
To make you forget me

I'll kill that weed somehow
Inside I speak for now
Before the centre's down

Aaaah ahh
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
Aaaah

Now, the dead who walk in dreams
Point south to where you sleep
Waste time no more

So if it's in our mind
I speak across the night
We'll find your dream tonight

Aaaah ahh
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
Aaaah

Aaaah ahh
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
Aaaah ahh
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
Aaaah
