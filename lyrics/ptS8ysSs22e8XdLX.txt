And I know how it's to be
there is nothing more for you and I
some are young and some are free
but I think I'm goin' blind

'cause I think I'm goin' blind
and I know how it should be
little lady can't you see
you're so young and so much different than I
I'm ninety-three you're sixteen
can't you see I'm goin' blind

'cause I think I'm goin' blind
and I know how it should be

'cause I think I'm goin' blind
and I know how it should be
you're much younger can't you see
there is nothing more for you and I
I'm ninety-three you're sixteen
and I think I'm goin' blind
yes, I think I'm goin' blind
and I know how it should be
