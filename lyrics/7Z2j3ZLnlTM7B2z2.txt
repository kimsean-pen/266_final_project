I couldn't talk to you but
I'd love to walk with you
I drop from the sky
Right as you say goodbye
Forever heartbound in our dreams

I lost my heart for you
And I set it free for two
Stones of the ground uncoverin' lines
That I never once knew were there

The horse of you
The horse with your head to the sky
We turn back again and I turn in my bed now
The horse is now on the run.
