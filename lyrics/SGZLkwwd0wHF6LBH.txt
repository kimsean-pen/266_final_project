Stay inside, no wild nights
'Cause I know that I'll be thinking too much about you
Yeah, won't go kiss strangers lips
'Cause I know that I'll be talking too much about you

About you
And all that we used to do
I hate that I don't know you like I used to, like I
No longer, what we have is that summer
Will I have one that's better?
Will I ever? Will I?

I'm in the middle of heartbreak
Middle of a, middle of a
Middle of a heartbreak, yeah

I'm in the middle of heartbreak
Middle of a, middle of a
Middle of a heartbreak, yeah

Can't go dance, don't make plans
'Cause I know that I'll be looking all around for you
On my worst days, there's no safe space
'Cause everything I do and see reminds me about you

About you
And all that we used to do
I hate that I don't know you like I used to, like I
No longer, what we have is that summer
Will I have one that's better?
Will I ever? Will I?

I'm in the middle of heartbreak
Middle of a, middle of a
Middle of a heartbreak, yeah
I'm in the middle of heartbreak
Middle of a, middle of a
Middle of a heartbreak, yeah

Need new friends for the weekend
Need new shows but I'm sleeping
Need new songs on my stereo, on my stereo
Need new friends for the weekend
Need new shows but I'm sleeping
Need new songs on my stereo, on my stereo

I'm in the middle of heartbreak
Middle of a, middle of a
Middle of a heartbreak, yeah

I'm in the middle of heartbreak
Middle of a, middle of a
Middle of a heartbreak, yeah

I'm in the middle of heartbreak
Middle of a, middle of a
Middle of a heartbreak, yeah

I'm in the middle of heartbreak
Middle of a, middle of a
Middle of a heartbreak, yeah
