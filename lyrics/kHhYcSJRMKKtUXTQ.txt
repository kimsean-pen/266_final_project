Back in these endless summer days
When we were staring at the sea
Is it felt so good
To simple hang around with you
We walk for hours on the shore
Hiding our bare feet in the sand
Is it felt so real
To feel the summer sun biting us skins
When you said I'm ready
Don't miss your chance
I biting to the apple that day
Back in these endless summer days
When we were staring at the sea
Is it felt so good
To taste the sweetness of that fruit
But it sudden turns into bitterness
Then comes the angle bitter sense
'cause it don't make any sense
I turn at my friends, I turn the best
When you said I'm ready
Don't miss your chance
I biting to the apple that day
BITTERSWEET FRUIT
BITTERSWEET FRUIT
BITTERSWEET FRUIT
I biting to the apple that day
BITTERSWEET FRUIT
I biting to the apple that day
BITTERSWEET FRUIT
BITTERSWEET FRUIT
I biting to the apple that day
