If the morning should slip by
I will find you in the nighttime
And if the ocean should ever run dry
I will await you on the shoreline

If this moment could be mine
I would seize it just in time
The stars will not align
This must be real apple shine

Because it's crystalline (Because it's crystalline)
Always on my mind (Always on my mind)
Mind, always on my mind

If your regulations do not comply
I will enable you to do the climb
And if you should feel uneasy at any time
I'll be the one to push you over that line
Yes, I will

If this moment could be mine
I would seize it just in time
The stars will not align
This must be real apple shine

Because it's crystalline (Because it's crystalline)
Always on my mind (Always on my mind)

Forget the ocean, forget the sea
Forget the story of you and me
The world is big and it's on TV
You cannot construct a canopy
Of the things you love to hide inside
Trees are big but the sky is wide
Wide enough to swallow you hole
You'll never really be in control
No, no no

Because you're crystalline (Because it's crystalline)
And always on my mind (Always on my mind)
This love is crystalline ('Cause it's like a liked crystalline)
And always on my mind
