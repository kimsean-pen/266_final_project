"This is a story about people who like to waste time... waste my time, waste your time, waste their time; but time is against them. Time is everyone's master, including them..."
Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock
3 piggies standing in the dock
Their pockets all empty and bare
Their futures, their homes, nowhere.

Auf wiedersehen...

Do vdjenja...

With egos they decide to lead
With stupidity they ooze and bleed
What comfort they could have had
Is now gone and up for grabs

Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock
3 piggies standing in the dock
Their snouts all bloody and red
They should have said goodbye instead.

Ciao!
Auf Wiedersehn!
Arrivederci piggie!
