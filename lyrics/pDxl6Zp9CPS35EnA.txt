Jesus was a stoner, uh-huh
Born in Southern California, uh-huh
Babylon on the corner, uh-huh
Why they try the stoner, uh-huh

I'm called the weed messiah
Rock your lighter
You transfixed with the spliff and your lips higher
Like smoke rises
Your sex is hightened
Inhale, embrace Mary, but don't be frightened
I bring the God flower
Uplift the people
Holy sacrament communion, take and let me feed you
No superstitions and crucifixions or false prophets
Crosses burning in my hand, call it burned object
Smoke gathers like holy masses
Take a hit, pass it to the left, it's in the passage

You know my disciples
This is a new revival
Judas rosen to the soil two in which to cycle
Smoking Mother Earth
Blessing is the herb
Mother Mary save us
Thankful for what you gave us
Roll it in my papers
Share it with my neighbours
High as scyscrapers
A cult of cultivators
We got the multitude
Our sisters and our brothers
How I break my bread
Like it's the last supper
I'm the blood of stoners
I'm the higher after
Believe me, elevate
Hear the signs of laughter
I'll be the greenest rapture

Stoned Jesus with the cleanest shatter
Some of demons has a dream depatcher
Get the screen capture
If you perceive this as a needless chatter
You need to hit a Stoned Jesus chapter
I'll be the greenest rapture
Stoned Jesus with the cleanest shatter
Some of demons has a dream inspector
Get the screen capture
If you perceive this as a needless chatter
You need to hit a Stoned Jesus chapter

Heavenly father, please forgive us again
Heavenly father, please forgive us again
