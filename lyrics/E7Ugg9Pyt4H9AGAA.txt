I live under conditions
I can't escape
In need of a change of pace
I don't want to be careful
Or play it safe
I wanna be reckless with you

I don't know what I'm used to
I don't know what I was yesterday

Don't wanna bother you, I want everything
You're where I want to be
Don't wanna bother you if you won't remain
The better part of me

I live under the pressure
At my own fate
I'm ready for things to change
I don't want to be careful
Or play it safe
I wanna be reckless with you

I don't know who I'm used to
I don't know what I had
I don't know who I'm used to
I don't know who I was yesterday

Don't wanna bother you, I want everything
You're where I want to be
Don't wanna bother you if you won't remain
The better part of me

You're where I want to be
You're where I want to be

I wanna live under your conditions
I wanna live under every word you say
I wanna live under your conditions
I wanna live under your conditions
I wanna live under every word you say
I wanna live under your conditions
I wanna live under every word you say

Under every word you say
Don't wanna bother you, I want everything
Don't wanna bother you, I want everything
You're where I wanna be
