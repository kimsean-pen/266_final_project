You got your keys
But where you going?
This third degree
Just isn't working...
'Cause you walked out without
Asking me to go,
And if I followed you home
Would you be alone?

I checked your phone cause it was beeping
Are you alone?
I know you're creeping...
'Cause you walked out
Without asking me to go,
But if I followed you home,
I hope you're alone.

I'm 3 steps from the edge,
Don't push me over it.
Don't you know, don't you know?

Every girl is capable of murder
If you hurt her.
Watch out you don't push me any further, Any further.
You're not the only one walking round with A loaded gun.
This little girl is capable of murder
'Cause you hurt her.

My hands are clean,
Not yet a killer.
Ain't I a queen,
And did you tell her?
'Cause you broke down
All my should've known betters,
And I followed you home,
Throwing sticks and stones.

I'm 2 steps from the edge,
Don't push me over it.
Don't you know, don't you know?

Every girl is capable of murder
If you hurt her.
Watch out you don't push me any further, Any further.
You're not the only one walking round with A loaded gun.
This little girl is capable of murder
'Cause you hurt her.

Don't you know?
You should never treat a girl like that.
Got a good alibi and my bags all packed.
Don't you know?
You should never treat a girl like that.
'Cause the next one is gonna have a
Hammer pulled back.

Every girl is capable of murder,
So watch out you don't push me any further.
But you f hurt her.

Every girl is capable of murder
If you hurt her.
Watch out you don't push me any further, Any further.
You're not the only one walking round with A loaded gun.
This little girl is capable of murder.

This little girl is capable of murder,
'Cause you hurt her.
