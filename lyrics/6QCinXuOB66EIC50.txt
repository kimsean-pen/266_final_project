Hello stranger, can you tell us where you've been?
More importantly, how ever did you come to be here?
Though a stranger, you can rest here for a while
But save your energy, your journey here is far from over
Come the sunrise we'll descend through Judgement Valley
And weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River

No direction, but to follow what you know
No direction, but a faith in her decision
No direction, but to never fight her flow
No direction, but to trust the final destination
You're a stranger till she whispers you can stay
You're a stranger till she whispers that your journey's over

Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River
Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River
Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River
Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River

No direction, but to follow what you know
No direction, but a faith in her decision
No direction, but to never fight her flow
No direction, but to trust the final destination
You're a stranger till she whispers you can stay
You're a stranger till she whispers that your journey's over

Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River
Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River
Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River
Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River
