Why leave it alive?
Shift your weight from both sides
Until you're exhausted
Why leave it alive?
Shift away altered light
Make yourself available

Not the first time
I've watched her body expand
A hundred times its size
To contain everything

Your subtle detachment
Spit straight from the mouth of
A modern blame kit

Camouflaged as justice
We watch your facade
Retreating inward

I've seen them spit you out
Adapt value
I've seen them spit you out
Adapt value
I've seen them spit you out
Adapt value
