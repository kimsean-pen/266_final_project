Shouldn't have that far to go
(That far to go)
The less you think the more you know

It seems the dream is impossible
It seems the dream is impossible
It seems the dream is impossible
Never made a difference so why should you
Promise me you won't look at me

There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left

There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left

No matter how hard I try
The lonely one refuses to die

Someday I will be a better man
Someday I will be a better man
Someday I will be a better man
Never made a difference so why should I
Promise me you won't look at me

There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left

There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left

Promise me you won't look at me

There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left

There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left here to talk about
There's nothing left
