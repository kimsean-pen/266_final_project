I don't know what it is
That makes me love you so
I only know I never wanna let you go
'Cause you started something
Oh, won't you see
That ever since we met
You've had a hold on me
It happens to be true
I only wanna be with you

It doesn't really matter what you say or do
I wanna spend each moment and any day with you
Oh, look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but it's true
I only wanna be with you

I don't know what it is
That makes me love you so
I only know I never wanna let you go
'Cause you started something
Oh, won't you see
That ever since we met
You've had a hold on me
It happens to be true
I only wanna be with you

You stopped and smiled at me
And asked if I'd care to dance
I fell into your open arms
And I didn't stand a chance

Now, listen, honey
I just wanna be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together, honey
I don't care
'Cause you started something
Oh, won't you see
That ever since we met
You've had a hold on me
It happens to be true
I only wanna be with you
No matter what you do
I only wanna be with you
