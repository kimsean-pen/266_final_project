The earth, Froze up
One dead, Pale world
And you'll swing, From the reaping hook (hearth?)
And you'll die, By a reaping hook (hearth?)

Locust, Locust
Furnace, Furnace

Corruption, In the goat herd
Flesh crumbles, In the real world

Silence
Barren
My furnace
Appealed
The locust furnace

Earth, Earth

Furnace, Furnace...
