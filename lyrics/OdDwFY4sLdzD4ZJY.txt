Sitting with you, sinking in the shade
Eating while we're sleeping, yeah i'm loosing sleep
You said: "why do you feel so fine?", I said it's lovely
yes it's lovely, yes it's lovely outside.

Please don't be sad my baby no
Please don't be sad my baby no
Please don't be sad you know you're mine
Oh yeah your'e mine

Thinking of you, thinking in the shade
Sleeping while I eat, repeat the things I say
I say: Why do i feel so shy? I said it's lovely
yes it's lovely, oh so lovely outside

Please don't be sad my baby no
Please don't be sad my baby no
Please don't be sad you know you're mine
Oh yeah your'e mine
