And If I told you how this story ends
Would you change a step you take
And if I could relive all of my days
I'd live them all the same

'Cause I'm scared
Of all that I don't know
'Cause I want it all but all of it ain't gold
And I'm scared
But I know it's not for long
'Cause I'm learning what I should've learned before

That all we are
Is a light into the darkness
And all we are
Is time that's counting down

And all we are
Is falling through the spaces in between
Endless flight

A lifetime in repeat

But I still find solace
When you say
That you know how I feel
When it's wrong
And we ain't been right for years

Let go
Give these ghosts a new home
Let's bury our past and our fears and all these bones

And let's go
I should've seen it long before
'Cause this is my life
I will not run in circles
Ending where I start

So hold on to me
We'll burn out slowly
And feel our hearts leap
To words we don't mean

Love
Means nothing to me
'Cause I don't know what it is
I'm just dying to be
All that I've been dreaming of
And words betray me
Contradict all I stand for
But I'm still learning
Yeah I'm still learning

That all we are
Is a light into the darkness
And oh we are
Just time that's counting down

And all we are
Is falling through the spaces in between
Endless flight

We're falling to our knees
