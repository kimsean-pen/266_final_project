Yeah, yeah

I like shining, you be lying
I be grinding, you waste time
Know you wanna roll with me
'Cause you know I put it down

When I show up, I'm the one and only
No, no, no (No, no)
Yeah, pull up in the Jag
Haters gon' be mad

I be walking with the cheese, that's that queso (Queso, queso)
Diamonds dripping, better bring your raincoat (Splash)

I got them racks on me (On me)
I brought the whole lit team with me
I might pull up in a spaceship
Hop out it, don't look like I live here

And now we in a zone (Oh)
Stand too close, might catch a cold
Crib came with a gate and a code
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dripping, water faucet, splash (Splash)

VVS my diamonds, I don't need no light to shine
Iced out both my wrists, now I can barely see the time
I just made a million and I'm still not satisfied
'Cause I need a bag on the regular
I spend a bag on the regular
We make the world go
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
My bank account go
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
We make the world go
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
Brrrah!
Dinero, peso, yen, lo quiero, I want it

I am too rich to compete, so don't compare 'em to me (Yeah, yeah)
We are not the same, only one of me (Hey, hey)

Hopped out the coupe, the sky is the roof (Roof)
My whole team ball (Ball)
We never lose, hundreds all blue (Hundreds)
We do what we do (Ball)

Hopping out casket-fresh, looking like a fashion show (Ayy)
Diamonds all on my neck, looking like a water show (Ayy, let's go)
She gon' bust it, bust it, bust it, for a real one

We gon' bring out the car
One way, no stop, to the stars
(Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Crew fly, Dubai
No, it ain't two sides, too high
One way to Mars, you better watch yourself
I did it all by myself (Go!)

And now we in a zone (Ice, ice)
Stand too close, might catch a cold (Stand too close)
Crib came with a gate and a code (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, drippin', water faucet, splash

VVS my diamonds, I don't need no light to shine (Oh)
Iced out both my wrists, now I can barely see the time (Oh)
I just made a million and I'm still not satisfied
'Cause I need a bag on the regular (Regular)
I spend a bag on the regular (brrrah!)
We make the world go
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
My bank account go
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
We make the world go
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
Brrrah! (Yeah, yeah)
Dinero, peso, yen, lo quiero, I want it

Multi-color diamonds like the rainbow (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
B-L -ind your eyes 번져 눈부셔
Yeah 자체발광 we flash 주체안돼 let's dance
Yeah, this isn't real, this is a regular move
머리 어깨 무릎발 무릎발, let's get bounce

Oh!
Oh! (Oh)
Run it up, run it up, run it up (Run it up)
No competition in front of us
We got the wave, we getting paid (Oh)

VVS my diamonds, I don't need no light to shine (Oh)
Iced out both my wrists, now I can barely see the time (Oh)
I just made millions off it, but I'm still not satisfied
'Cause I need a bag on the regular (Regular)
I spend a bag on the regular
We make the world
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
My bank account go
