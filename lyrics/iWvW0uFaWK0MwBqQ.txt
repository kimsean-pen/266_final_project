Old crows ride in the mouth of the beast
Sleep beneath its tongue, cradled by its teeth
We roam from shore to shore
From the open sky to the ocean floor

The more we move, the less we are ourselves
And when we finally stop, we change to something else

As rapid as, a river flows
As frigid as, the cold wind can blow
As devious as the devil's grin
Our blood is cold as we shed our skin now

We are are not the kids we used to be
(Stop wishing for yesterday)
We are are not the kids we used to be
(Stop wishing for yesterday)
We are are not the kids we used to be
Oh-oh-oh
We are are not the kids we used to be
Stop wishing for yesterday

The crows are calling, seems the end is near
They're spelling out our names yet we have no fear
All the damage that a man can do
When ambition takes over we search for the truth

Sometimes, life just gets the best of us
Some things in life will get the best of us

We are are not the kids we used to be
(Stop wishing for yesterday)
We are are not the kids we used to be
(Stop wishing for yesterday)
We are are not the kids we used to be
Oh-oh-oh (stop wishing for yesterday)
We are are not the kids we used to be
Stop wishing for yesterday
Wishing for yesterday!

Every skyline beats in my chest
Somewhere between love and sadness
This is our fate, this is our test
We ride in the mouth of madness

As rapid as a river flows
As frigid as the cold wind can blow
As devious as the devil's creep
Our blood is cold, now we'll shed our skin!

We are are not the kids we used to be
(Stop wishing for yesterday)
We are are not the kids we used to be
(Stop wishing for yesterday)
We are are not the kids we used to be
Oh-oh-oh (stop wishing for yesterday)
We are are not the kids we used to be
(Stop wishing for yesterday)
Wishing for yesterday
Wishing for yesterday
