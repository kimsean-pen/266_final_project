Where my lost mind
I can't read your dreams
Maybe your victims'
Faces are hidden to survive!
And now I run to live

My suffering fills my selfish desire to die!
We disable the gravity off the earth
Your evil instruction
Deprived my wish to arrive!
I hold my breath and dive to the bottom
Losing own future, I turn into a ghost

You close your walls to me!
I vainly seeking a way out
Your instincts of pleasure
Are masking by your misery!
Nobody lives inside your space

Sleeping for saving mind
You'll wake me and satellites
Come back down to the earth

You tease me and bring it all
But I can't feel this right
You'll wake me and satellites
You'll wake me and satellites

No! I must leave these depths
And the feelings that
They aroused in me, but
Now I can only crawl

Sleeping for saving...
Sleeping for saving mind
You'll wake me and satellites
Come back down to the earth

You tease me and bring it all
But I can't feel this right
You'll wake me and satellites
You'll wake me and tell me more

I feel I can not losing mind
You say - I'm even losing myself
You say - I can not losing my myself

I felt it clawing at my skin
Reminding me of feelings
That I had felt outside myself

Nothing lives inside your space
Come back down to the earth

Sleeping for saving.
Sleeping for saving mind
You'll wake me and satellites
Come back down to the earth

You tease me and bring it all
But I can't feel this right
You'll wake me and satellites
You'll wake me and tell me more

I feel I can not losing mind
You say - I'm even losing myself
You say - I can not losing my myself
