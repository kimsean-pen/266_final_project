Hey girl, you've got a smart way
About you that makes me wish that I was smart enough for you
Hey girl, you've got a fine laugh
And I think that I can get used to that
And you're already used to laughing at me

So what if your friends think I'm crazy, well
I wasn't trying to impress those girls anyway
They're all theory, no action
Where I'm from we live
like it's the latest attraction

Hey girl, you've got a short fuse
and I've got designs on lighting you up
and setting you off
and watching you burn for me

The world lives for the weekends
Well I watched as my weeks bleed right into them
Without a line to divide what is theirs
and what is mine

So what if your friends think I'm crazy, well
I wasn't trying to impress those girls anyway
They're all theory, no action
Where I'm from we live like it's the latest attraction

Go on, go on, your cruel intentions
Won't solve your problems,
Everyone's gotta get bottom
Bottomed out in the long run
And those are the times you need love

Go on, go on, your cruel intentions
Won't solve your problems,
Everyone's gotta get bottom
Bottomed out in the long run
And those are the times you need love

Go on, go on, your cruel intentions
Won't solve your problems,
Everyone's gotta get bottom
Bottomed out in the long run
And those are the times you need love
