Why are you trying to hide
what I've seen in your eyes?

And I know, like you know
there's nothing living on the face of the world
But you know like I know
some kind of value's just dying to be born,
in the eyes of the world.

Enraptured in guilt,
it feels so good to be bad
You're willing to slight
all the tryings to try below you.

And I know, like you know
there's nothing living on the face of the world
But you know, you must know...
some kind of value's just dying to be born,
in the eyes of the world.

I know it's hard when every finger you point,
gets pointed back at you.
I know it's hard when every fist that you raise,
seems to hover over you...

But there's a question
like a knife.

And it won't allow you to hide,
it won't allow you to hide.
