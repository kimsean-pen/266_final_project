I remember when I, struck your hair
You turned and told me, you had no other cares
But when we went and walked the other streets
The joy the life we felt beneath our feet

But time changes
We turn pages
And everything we said, turns golden dead
But time changes
Fades old faces
She sleeps, in a new bed

Sure enough, you'll have a new man now
Something he can give
I find myself without
And I can eat all the, oranges and pairs
But she ain't coming back she says
Simply ends

But time changes we turn pages
And everything we said, turns golden dead
But time changes
Fades old faces
She sleeps, in a new bed

Well time changes
We turn pages
And everything we were
With someone else
But time changes
We build new spaces
And she sleeps
Humming
She sleeps, in a new bed
