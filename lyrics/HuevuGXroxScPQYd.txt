Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah

Got to find me a way to take me back to yesterday
How can I ever hope to forget you?
Show me a place where I can hide my lonely face
I know you're going to break my heart if I let you, oh yeah

Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?

Like a moth to a flame, like a song without a name
I've never been the same since I met you
Like a bird on the wing, got a brand new song to sing
I can't keep from singing about you, oh

Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?

You see what a fool you've made of me
I might have to break the law when I find you
Stop running away, I've got a better game to play
You know I can't go on living without you, oh
