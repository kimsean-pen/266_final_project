Some days, I don't stand a chance
It's dark, I know
My face mirrors at a glance
So you think you know
The things I know
You feign to know

But it's different, it's different
When the world falls apart, it breaks my heart
But it's different, it's different
When the world falls apart, it breaks my heart
I wouldn't wish it on anyone

Some days I would never stand a chance
She's on my mind
Paramount loss puts me ever in a trance
You were hard to find
Memories fade, I couldn't tell what I forgot
For better or for worse
Wish I could trade, but that warrants second thought
I'm blessed, I'm cursed

But it's different, it's different
When the world falls apart, it breaks my heart
But it's different, it's different
When the world falls apart, it breaks my heart
I wouldn't wish it on anyone

And it crushed me, and it crushes me
I'm just barely holding on
It crushes me every day
I'm just barely holding on
And if I let go
If I let go
I'm never coming back
I'm never coming back

When everything looks black
I'm just a moment from the sun
The water breaks my back
And I'm the only one
When everything looks black
I'm just a moment from the sun
The water breaks my back
And I'm the only one
The water breaks my back
And I'm the only one
The water breaks my back
And I'm the only one
