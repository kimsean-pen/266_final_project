Stepping into the town, ignore the stink of burning leather
'Cause you're young and right down radio sings, cool life forever
And depending on the weather, you'll be there
Your shadow tall, you lean against the wall
Waiting on the call
Waiting on the call that will set it out

At the top of the hour, meet me at Cappuccino City
Roaches climbing the wall, coffee is cold
Service is shitty, in neon light you look so pretty
As you say
Your race is run, no longer having fun
You're not the only one
Not the only one with short memory
You're not the only one with short memory

FM on the stereo
Belgians in the Congo
Short memory
Cappuccino City
