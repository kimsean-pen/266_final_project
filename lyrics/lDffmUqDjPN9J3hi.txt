This ruined puzzle
is beige with the pieces
all face down.

So the placing goes slowly.
The pictures of anything
other than it's meant to be.

But the hours they creep
The patterns repeat
Don't be concerned
You know I'll be fine on my own.
I never said "Don't Go" (don't go)

But I've hidden a note
It's pressed between pages that
you've marked to find your way back.
It says...
"Does he ever get the girl? "
But what if the pages stay pressed
The chapters unfinished
The stories too dull to unfold?
Does he ever get the girl?

This basement's a coffin
I'm buried alive
I'll die in here just to be safe.
I'll die in here just to be safe.

'Cause you're gone
I get nothing
and you're off with barely a sigh
I never said goodbye.

But I've hidden a note
It's pressed between pages
That you've marked to find your way back
It says...
"Does he ever get the girl?"
But I've hidden a note
That's pressed between pages
That you'll read if you're so inclined
Does he ever get the girl?

But the hours they creep
The patterns repeat
Don't be concerned
I know I'll be fine on my own.
I never said "Don't Go" (don't go)

Does he ever get the girl?
