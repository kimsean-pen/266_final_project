I won't ever tell on you
Ever see me do
I wait forever for you
Figure out your problem with me is you

I won't ever be like you
Ever see right through
I wait forever for you
Figure out your problem with me is you

I won't ever tell on you
Ever see right through
I wait forever for you
Figure out your problem with me is you

You come running through
Figure out your problem with me is you

I won't ever tell
