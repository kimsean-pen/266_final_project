I've been away too long
Our conversation have been few
But while I've been away each and every day
My heart was beatin' next to you, oh yeah

Now I'm here at last
Oh, and I'm here to stay
Look into my eyes, then you'll realize
There is only one thing left to say, oh

Tell me
(Tell me you love me)
Be right there
(Tell me you care)

Tell me, tell me, tell me, baby
(Tell me you love me)
Come on and, come on and
(Tell me you care)

(Tell me you love me)
I really love you
(Tell me you care)
You know I need you

(Tell me you love me)
Come on, baby, now
(Tell me you care)

I'm not askin' for money
Three little words you know, oh
If you want some sweet feelin', I'll be out here and I'm willin'
To take you where you want to go, oh

Tell me
(Tell me you love me)
Come on, come on, baby
(Tell me you care)

Let me hear it, let me hear you now
(Tell me you love me)
Ooh, yeah, yeah, oh
(Tell me you care)

Those sweet little words
(Tell me you love me)
Come on, baby
(Tell me you care)

Words from [Incomprehensible]
(Tell me you love me)
Tell me, tell me, baby
(Tell me you care)

Let me hear, let me hear, let me hear, let me hear, let me hear that
(Tell me you love me)
Oh, come on, baby
