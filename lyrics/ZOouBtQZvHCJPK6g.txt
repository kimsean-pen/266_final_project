Caught in the little things
To distract from what
We're all wondering
What will be there to protect us?

We're sorry, we are closed, rushing
Paperbacks are torn, traffic
Red lights blinking
I won't make it tonight

And my lips are closing now, kiss me
Eyes that shut me out
Embracing day after day, working it out

Caught up in the little things
To distract from what
We're all wondering, wondering, wondering
Why are we here in the first place
Tiny little cars down there
It's a long fall
We're all wondering, wondering, wondering
What will be there to protect us

It's the little things
It's the little things
It's the little things
It's the little things

It's the little things
It's the little things
It's the little things
It's the little things

It's the little things
It's the little things
It's the little things
It's the little things

It's the little things
It's the little things
It's the little things
It's the little things

And I scream against the wind, hear me
Will you leave it in my hands, count me in
Story is mine, live it
I'll jump for your life
I'm 2 steps from the stairs up to my baby
Gonna toss out all the doubt
'Cause I am ready
I'm a little late, 'cause lately I've been aching
And I know that I've been all around
But you've got me all now

Caught up in the little things
To distract from what
We're all wondering, wondering, wondering
Why are we here in the first place
Tiny little cars down there
It's a long fall
We're all wondering, wondering, wondering
What will be there to protect us

Caught up in the little things
I didn't sleep much! And did I do enough?
To distract from what
Will a hurricane sweep us? Into the dark blue cloud above
We are all wondering, wondering, wondering
And am I able to be a wife and a friend and a rebel
Why are we here in the first place
Settle down and live in a fable. Peter Pan lost at the pool table
Tiny little cars down there
Am I looking for trouble? Seeing stars in the Hubble?
It's a long fall
We are all wondering, wondering, wondering
I'm forever so blind in this puzzle
What will be there to protect us

It's the little things, little things, little things...
