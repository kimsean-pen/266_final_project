London city I was born in
You know I love this town
But I can't pick up when she's calling

So rhythm it was following me to the place and raise me
Gave me the up down the dribble up and shape me
Give me a run downtown where the rough make sound
Does a ratting now the underground don't phase me
I never been no one to stay in just one place bling
But I love when the music??? they fly
From the mountain tops to an eastern top
Or a tropical island I got your nice vibe
But don't matter where we go we live in London town
Relaying but we rain up in a black speed one
Turn up and then we're ready for the sound check drum
So come a little closer running with the monsoon
Throw me back in the morn in the way that we racing
Ah things I got I catch it tell me who I'm facing
No matter where we go we are coming on home
I said London me young and me ah racing

Well I love the London music that come before me time
Got the new vibes got me working???
Whether the bongo roots of culture???
So I take a little trip on the Victoria line
And I check the tip of??? system
Sipping ron tone and we see that brad djin Osman, he says

The sins??? we ah go chime as ona??? one day is upon us
I want them talk ina mo the place???

Because I really love my London town
Through the up and through the down
I been almost everywhere
But I've enough to come back here
So much different things to do
So much different things to see
It is multicultural now, but I just love it anyhow
Born and raised right here, smoke a drew, drink a beer
Know in a go have no fear, will love this land and atmosphere
It is where I am from, it is where I belong
It's the only place for me, for me and my family

London city I was born in
You know I love this town
But I can't pick up when she's calling
'Cause I'm a resident that's why
