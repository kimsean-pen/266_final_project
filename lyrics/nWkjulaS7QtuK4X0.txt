When I lay down
Sun brings dawn
Pure than ever
It holds me in their arms
And I waited...

You may live on a raft
Always sailing
Your own lost way and now,
Just a melt of suffer and tears from all

"Don't ever
Let me down"
Well, I guess somebody said
Don't run away from
Where it rises
So they say the truth meant dawn

Breaking
All the waves
You rather live like your own hope
Drifting away
Caught up on the wrong road

Breaking
All the waves
You rather live like your own hope
Drifting away
Caught up on the wrong road
(Caught up on the wrong road)

Who may dream to be left?
Always sailing
Your own lost way just found
Compromising peace and years of love

Uh,
"Don't ever
Let me down"
Well, I guess somebody said
Don't run away from
Where it rises
So they say the truth meant dawn

Breaking
All the waves
You rather live like your own hope
Drifting away
Caught up on the wrong road

Breaking
All the waves
You rather live like your own hope
Drifting away
Caught up on the wrong road
(Caught up on the wrong road)

And all your blame blind to see
This is real life
This is day and night
It's hard to know
What we lost for all those years
But we were young
And free from the loneliness of mind

Breaking
All the waves
You rather live like your own hope
Drifting away
Caught up on the wrong road
(Caught up on the wrong road)

Breaking
All the waves
You rather live like your own hope
Drifting away
Caught up on the wrong road
(Caught up on the wrong road)

I've made my own
Way
I've made my own
