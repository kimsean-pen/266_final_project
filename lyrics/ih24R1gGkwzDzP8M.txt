Five lines written on a postcard
Five lines I'm a little closer
Five lines written on a postcard for you

Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go

Ink so permanent
Yeah it's so permanent
Any way I mark it down

Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go

Faint and numb
You keep my head unsteady and my hands shake
Fought another day, and now
You wait until I'm standing in your landscape

Said we're looking at the stars
We're floating into empty spaces, I know
That we're looking at the stars
Our burning open sky illustrated, no more

Five lines written on a postcard
Five lines and then it's over
Five lines sitting on your dresser for you

Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go

It's so permanent
Yeah it's so permanent
Any way I tell it to you

Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go

Faint and numb
You keep my head unsteady and my hands shake
Fought another day, and now
You wait until I'm standing in your landscape

Said we're looking at the stars
We're floating into empty spaces, I know
That we're looking at the stars
Our burning open sky illustrated, no more

Said we're looking at the stars
Connected by our constellation, I know
That we're looking at the stars
Our bodies lie in separate places, reposed

Five lines written on a postcard
Five lines I'm a little closer
Five lines written on a postcard for you

Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
Either way you go
