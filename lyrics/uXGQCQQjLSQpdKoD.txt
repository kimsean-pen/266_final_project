I know that I've been hard to please
But I recognize
And when I'm thinking rationally
I love that you're all mine

And I know that you've been working hard
Tryna keep that, keep that money large
When I hear you coming through the door
Gonna show you, show you this is yours

Lemme show you my appreciation, 'preciation
Lemme show you my appreciation, 'preciation
I know you never really hear me say it, hear me say it, oh
Lemme show you my appreciation, 'preciation, oh
(Lemme show you my appreciation)

You never loved me anyway
You never loved me anyway (appreciation)
You never loved me anyway
You never loved me anyway

I know that I've been hard to read
But I tell no lies
I can't just think nationally
The whole world should be mine

And I know that you've been working hard
Tryna keep that, keep that money large
When I hear you coming through the door
Gonna show you, show you this is yours

Lemme show you my appreciation, 'preciation
Lemme show you my appreciation, 'preciation
I know you never really hear me say it, say it, oh
Lemme show you my appreciation, 'preciation, oh
(Lemme show you my appreciation)

You never loved me anyway
You never loved me anyway (appreciation)
You never loved me anyway
You never loved me anyway

And you know that I be on vacation
Had to throw away my medication
When I see your constellation stars
Gonna show you, show you this is ours
Lemme show you my appreciation

You never loved me anyway
You never loved me anyway (appreciation)
You never loved me anyway
You never loved me anyway (appreciation)
You never loved me anyway
You never loved me anyway (appreciation)
You never loved me anyway
You never loved me anyway (appreciation)
