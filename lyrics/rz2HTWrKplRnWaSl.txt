If you don't want these arms to hold you
If you don't want these lips to kiss you
If you've found somebody new
Put me back in the crowd
Put the sun behind the clouds
Put me back in the crowd

There's a battle going on
Between the blue and the gray
And if you don't want my love
Don't make me stay

There's a battle going on
Between the blue and gray
And if you don't want my love
Don't make me stay

Take back your name
Take back these wings
Take my picture from the frame
And put me back in the crowd
Put the sun behind the cloud
Put me back in the crowd

Put me back in the crowd
Put the sun behind the cloud
Put me back in the crowd
