And I, will hold you tight
Like the moon in the arms of the sky
And I, will keep you warm
I will build a fire in this house

And I'll build a fire
You fetch the water and I'll lay the table
And in our hearts
We still pray for sons and daughters
And all those evenings
Out in the garden, where we went
These quiet hours turning to years

And I, I'll wrap myself
Around your heart
I'll be the walls of his heart
And I, I'll keep light on
To call you back home

And I'll build a fire
You fetch the water and I'll lay the table
And in our hearts
We still pray for sons and daughters
And all those evenings
Out in the garden, where we went
These quiet hours turning to years

And it's all to come
For now we're still young
Just building our kingdom
But it's all to come

And I'll build a fire
You fetch the water and I'll lay the table
And in our hearts
We still pray for sons and daughters
And all those evenings
Out in the garden, with red wine
These quiet hours turning to years

It's all to come
For now we're still young
