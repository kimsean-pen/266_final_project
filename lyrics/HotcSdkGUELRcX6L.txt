I can hear her heartbeat from a thousand miles
And her air was open everytime she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
And I run into her
Like a river's song

She give me love, love, love, love
Crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love
Crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humour when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache
In the night like a theif

She give me love, love, love, love
Crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love
Crazy love

And I need her in the daytime
I need her (I need her)
And I need her in the night (I need her)
And I want to throw my arms around her (I need her)
And kiss and hug her kiss and hug her tight

And when I'm returning
From so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin'
Brightens up my day
And it makes me righteous and it makes me whole
And it makes me mellow
Down into my soul

She give me love, love, love, love
Crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love
Crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love
Crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love
Crazy love
