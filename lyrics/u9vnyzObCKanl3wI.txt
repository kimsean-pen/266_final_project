We knew each other when we were very young
High school sweethearts, or something American
Now we've become old I only see photos
She's what I thought, something American
Something American
But you don't call me now
And I don't think too much about you
But when she's not around
I can feel you're lonely
Oh, I can feel you're lonely somehow
I'm not nice like her
Won't wear white like her
Don't live life with the pages [?]
No, I'm not perfect
But then no one is
We're all reaching for something American
But you don't call me now
And I don't think too much about you
But when she's not around
I can feel you're lonely
I can feel you all night
In my dreams I find
The stars align [?]
And it's you and I
Oh, back in time, it feels so right
But you don't call me now
And I don't think too much about you
But when she's not around
I can feel you're lonely, oh
You don't call me now
And I don't think too much about you
But when she's not around
I can feel you're lonely, oh
I can feel you're lonely somehow
We knew each other when we were very young
High school sweethearts, or something American
