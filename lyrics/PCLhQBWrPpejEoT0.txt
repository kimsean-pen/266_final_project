Wide is the line
Separates the rivers from the dirt
All the while I wonder who's the one
Within the one and only eye (we all stood cut free)

Within the one and only eye (we all stood cut free)

Within the one and only eye (we all stood cut free)
Within the one and only eye (Self-blinded to see through the veil)
Can you see there's a child

Standing idle by us in this mess
Who am I to cause this emptiness
Willing the sea to cleanse my soul
Of all that I've been
To bring me free to this clarity

Clarity
Trouble rolls in
As the tides, they twist and make the turn
Pain subsides

And sweeps across the earth again
Willing the sea to cleanse my soul
Of all that I've been
To bring me free to this clarity
Clarity

Within the one and only eye (we all stood cut free)

Within the one and only eye (we all stood cut free)
Within the one and only eye (we all stood cut free)
Within the one and only eye (Self-blinded to see through the veil)
I'm standing deep in these waters
Bleeding free and bent

To drag us onto the new visions
Only loss fills my void
Only loss fills my void
Only loss fills my void
Only the void connects me

With these mountains
Of dust, blood and soil
The stones born in the flames of truth
Demand a sacrifice
A sacrifice
A sacrifice
A sacrifice
Don't just bleed us and leave us to ourselves
We will return so deeply harmed
And we will shatter you
And we will shatter you
And we will shatter you.
