We, together
Change the world forever
What a cheerful sound

Synchronize me
Supervise me, mother
No more fooling around

Whatever may come
It shall be from the ashes
He shall rise, I know

And though it hurts me
Don't be surprised, dear mother
Longing to see his end

Don't call it
Hopelessly insane
I go and grasp the grail

But in a graceful way
Illegally, my aim
The grail will cross the border now

Don't tell me that you're innocent
Don't tell me it's divinely ordained by the saints
My demons, my saviors
I weep for all of them suffered in vain

My wayward son, you might disturb me
Carry the flame
Till dying embers will stop gleaming
Carry the flame

There on the battlefield she sings
Praise, hallelujah
The Holy Grail's on its way now

Magna eterna
Magna eterna sings
Your journey's over
The Holy Grail's on its way now

Do as it's foreseen
Come and meet the king
There's no choice
For the word it must be

Real, my righteous brother
Fear you soon will know

So, on the fourteenth day passover
He took the firstborn sons
Execute him and now act as
Judas, the chosen one

So after all, in vain
I've met him and found the grail
Cause in a skillful way

I'll change to keep alive
Eternal lie,
I'll be the one

Key to life, be the eclipse
Voices from the river Styx
Come to be the Nemesis
Kiss of death, crucifix and the grail

I've traveled far on hidden pathways
The Holy Grail
Who would have thought that I will hold it
The Holy Grail

There on the battlefield she sings
Praise, hallelujah
The Holy Grail's on its way now

Magna eterna
Magna eterna sings
Your journey's over
The Holy Grail's on its way now

Don't tell me that you're innocent
Don't tell me that there is a chance to be free
The grail's sent,
My way ends

I creep along with the shadows and resurrected
He comes marching in
There he is
Good lord forgive my sins

Once I've crossed the river Styx
At Sheol's gate, I know
Key to the apocalypse
I have sealed it with a kiss

Nothing that I want to do
Hades is calling
Wake the witch,
Who'll be the brave one?

Don't say what he's like
Full of voices comes the ninth wave
Don't say what it's like
Beyond the door

There on the battlefield she sings
Praise, hallelujah
The Holy Grail's on its way now

Magna eterna
Magna eterna sings
Your journey's over
The Holy Grail's on its way now

Norns are howling
Norns are prowling.
