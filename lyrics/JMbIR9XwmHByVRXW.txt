Sometimes strangers give the best advice
And I'm just trying to make it through this life
Every time I needed the money to run
I always did what needed to be done
Fifty-five minutes, and it's starting to click
Just how my skin became so thick

The bravest city in the world
I hope she gets what she deserves
But I'm just trying to make it through this life
Flying in to George Best City tonight

Sometimes a place can seem a little too small
And you can read the writing on the wall
But I can't deny what I came to know
And everything about her just seems to glow
Crossing the east bridge, I was caught in the breeze
The leaves were brown and falling from the trees

The bravest city in the world
I hope she gets what she deserves
But I'm just trying to make it through this life
Flying in to George Best City tonight
