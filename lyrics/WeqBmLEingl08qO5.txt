Light falls
On the pavement
Wakeful
With my guard let down

Holding tightly to the words you gave me
Under oath the minute I said maybe

Steady dedication
In my resignation
Empty handed 'cause I live in daydreams
That's why I haven't shown my face here lately

(Say it to my heart and run)
And I don't know what I was running from
(And run)
But I knew you'd say it to my heart and run (and run)

You knew it from the start
You've won, you've won, you've won

You knew it from the start
You've won, you've won, you've won

So blame it on my heart
And run, and run, and run

So blame it on my heart
And run, and run, and run, and run

Hopeful, but impatient
Floating so I'm not tied down
I'm becoming what the Fable gave me
Stepping sideways off the path of safety

So I could say to you that I was wrong, and go on with it or
I could play the fool and be outdone
But my defence your honour waits above
I'm becoming what the Fable made me

(Say it to my heart and run)
And I don't know what I was running from
(Say it to my heart)

You knew it from the start
You've won, you've won, you've won

You knew it from the start
You've won, you've won, you've won

So blame it on my heart
And run, and run, and run, and run

So blame it on my heart
And run, and run, and run,
