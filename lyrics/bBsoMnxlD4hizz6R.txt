Dreaming with no sound
Silence screams so loud
Trying to break through, anyway, to you
Tears fall like rain
And I can see your pain
It's time to fix you up again

For your love
I'd take the sun from the sky
I'd steal the moon from the night
And I will never let go

For your love
I will climb any mountain
Stand at the top shouting out and
You'll hear my love pouring down
Like an echo

The world is frozen now
Leaves all on the ground
And know, it feels the sun will never return
But up here in the sky
On this mountain high
Above the clouds the light still shines

For your love
I'd take the sun from the sky
I'd steal the moon from the night
And I will never let go

For your love
I'll climb any mountain
Stand at the top shouting out and
You'll hear my love pouring down

Like an echo-o-o
You're my echo-o-o
I'll might love it with my lo-o-o
From my echo
Like an echo-o-o
You're my echo-o-o
I'll might love it with my lo-o-o
From my echo
