Smash Out!!

アーティスト MY FIRST STORY

You have to realize already
We're better than that idol shit
Don't just stand there in one place, go ahead say my name

You always protect yourself
We don't want to live on without saying what we want to say out loud
Raise middle finger high up to the sky

We are all gonna get in a fight！
Don't you really like it？？ really like it？？
Let's do the rock'n roll
Don't you really like it？？ really like it？？
Let's do the rock'n roll
最後に全て潰れるまで
We ain't nothing but just troublemakers
Break it！！ Break it！！
That is all I want

"What are you talking about？？"
"Well... Nothing, not you"
I'm never going to lose, I'm a mother fucking prince
"Hey guys, bring it on"
"No thnx, We will pass"
You are freaking full of shit！！

You are having such a sour face
Low cuz your money dropped off？
I'll lend you as much as you just may
need when I say goodbye

We are never seeing again

I don't care about what you think about me now
SHIT！！！！！！！
