I am your joy, your best of joy,
I am the moonlight, you are the spring,
our life's a sacred thing,
You know I always will love you, I am forever.

I am the one who came when you fell down,
I was the only one around (the only one),
When things would hurt you,
I am forever.

Wasn't it I who said that you are free?
When living seems so hard to be, and things would hurt you,
I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever

I am your friend,
Through thick and thin,
We need each other,
We'll never part,
Our love is from the heart,
We never say "I don't need you",

We are forever.
I am the one who said that you are free,
When living seems so hard to be (the only one),
And nothing would cheer you,
I am forever,
Wasn't it I who carried you around?
When all the walls came tumbling down,
When things would hurt you,
I am forever, I am forever,

We are forever, we are forever.
You are the sun that lights up the sky,
When things are shady,
Let come what may we do get by,
I was the only one around (the only one),
When things would hurt you,
We are forever (I am forever),
We are forever (I am forever),
We are forever (gotta do and do more),
We are forever (gotta do and do more, have to be strong),
We are forever (gotta do and do more),
we are forever, (uh- hum, all right),
I am forever,
I am forever,
I am forever (uh- hum, all right),
we are forever,
we are forever (hee),
I am forever,
I am forever.
