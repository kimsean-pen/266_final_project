All I see is scrubs
Face mean mugged
On a couple drugs
Smoke with migo plug
FTP my blood
Grey the fucking gang
Boy stay in your lane
Never high
Just maintain
Hate this fame
Hate this game
Take these shoes
Last a day
Oil flowing through my veins
Lil remains that make that stain
Y'all look good in cellophane mane
Insane
Real blade
Swing it through your fucking brain
I said fuck 'em
We got a problem
Fuck you gonna do with it?
I think nada
Just a persona
And I'm nirvana
Popping xans will make you mad I know you want some
Rolling rolling rolling rolling rolling rolling rolling
Got an ounce of the coke white snow floating
River road shawty
Yung christ one chosen
Slick tote the AK47 stolen
Woadie joscin'
All of y'all are over-saturating 'preme and bape
Bitch its FTP all fucking day
All y'all look the fucking same
Fuck the fame
Fuck a lane
Bitch I'm bout to swerve into the toll booth and scrape the change
Bring out your dead and blaming it on Yung Plague
Bitch I pull up with the K
K9 by my right leg until I say OK
K9 on his hind legs ripping off your face
All I gotta say is G59 until the grave
One color
Two numbers
Three fingers in the sky amongst the thunder
I'm like fuck the others
Ima bring the ruckus
I might fuck your bitch
She swears she suffers under the covers
Ima hell hound
Hell bound
Shawty wanna die
Ima sell pounds, sell pounds
Shawty said she might let them bells pound, bells pounds
Shawty wanna cry
I'm like fuck it
Every night keep turning black
I close my eyes
