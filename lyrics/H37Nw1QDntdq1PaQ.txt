You see me unraveling
I know the difference this time
You pull me in, you pull me out
I'm deserving.
Don't matter what you do wrong,
I put your needs before mine,
It doesn't really matter what they say
It doesn't really matter what they say
SO take what you want from me,
take what you want from me.
take what you want from me.
And I'll give you all my love,
I'll give you everything
Just take what I don't need.
I know I've made some mistakes
but I'll be different you'll see
I'll give in, tell me how
I keep falling.
I'm sleeping under a wave of gold
so can I sleep?
It doesn't really matter what they say
So take what you want from me,
take what you want from me.
take what you want from me.
And I'll give you all my love,
I'll give you everything
Just take what I don't need.
So you wanna talk about this way you wanna go
And I don't need to think about losing you to know
How it feels, how it feels?
So take what you want from me,
take what you want from me.
take what you want from me.
And I'll give you all my love,
I'll give you everything
