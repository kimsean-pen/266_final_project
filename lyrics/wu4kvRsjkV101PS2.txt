Yeah you already know what time it is
Time is of the essence mothafucka

Take drugs when I need to
Get love when I need to, Fuck when I need to
Show love when I need to
Get rough if in need get up if I need to
Trust none when I need to
Feel done when I need to none when I need two
Abhorred when I need to
Good lord if I need take yours if I need to

Come up catch slip back
Coma shaft open gas

Don't know what I need
You keep telling me
Get away from me
Hundred ways to make me feel
Only one way to make me heal

Come up catch slip back
Coma shaft open gas

Take drugs when I need to
Get love when I need to, Fuck when I need to
Show love when I need to
Get rough if in need get up if I need to
Trust none when I need to
Feel done when I need to none when I need two
Abhorred when I need to
Good lord if I need take yours if I need to

One bottle when I need two
I sip when I need one bottle when I need two
I hit when I need to
Cut wrist when I need I lick when I need to
On the street when I need to
I bleed when I need to I eat when I need to
Fought cops when I need to
On the street when I need to eat when I need to

Come up catch slip back
Coma shaft open gas

Don't know what I need
You keep telling me
Get away from me
Hundred ways to make me feel
Only one way to make me heal
