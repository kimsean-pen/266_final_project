To the bottom, dear, I had to fall
But you really caught me
You really caught me, dear
At the bottom where I fall

And slowly dear, asked would you dance with me?
Here's the shades down
The lights off

And I didn't know you
And everything I do, done badly

Now I'll love you always
Even when I say you distract me

And set out tonight at some strange place
If we have no friends here
Well, I had a few to begin with

To wake next to you in the morning
And good morning to you!
How do you do?
A good morning to you!
And more covers for you.
Sleep soundly, dear, 'cause I have to go.

Yeah, I'll love you always
And when we leave this place
and drive back to Carolina
and down to Savannah and stay
