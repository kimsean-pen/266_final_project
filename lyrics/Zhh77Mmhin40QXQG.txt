Cool yourself, you are flush red
Your ankles help you twist
'cause the truth made you bend

But oh Goddamn, if you wanted it you would
Oh Goddamn, if you wanted it you would
I will not ask anymore
I cannot ask anymore

Ooh whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh oh-oh
Ooh whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh oh-oh
Ooh whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh oh-oh
Ooh whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh oh

I will love you like this now
You can recognize it later
I will love you like this now
You can recognize it later
But I would never blame you
if you could never stay here

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Ooh whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh oh-oh
Ooh whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh oh-oh
Ooh whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh oh-oh
Ooh whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh oh
