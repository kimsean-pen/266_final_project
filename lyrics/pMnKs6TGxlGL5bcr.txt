I see you in the dark
'Cause I've been where you are
You're too scared to show me love
'Cause you're too fresh with the scars

Well, I don't have the answers
So I won't tell you lies
You were there when I was down, love
But you gotta live your own life

She said I CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN
No, I CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN
I found my love and I
I don't wanna lose it again

And I, I told you all my secrets, lover
Now I, I don't wanna hide, to speak to another 'bout this
And I, I find it hard to fully trust you
And I, I'm still in there, this multicolored cluster of lust

And now she said I CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN
No, I CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN
I found my love and I
I don't wanna lose it again

And I, I found you all through this discover
We say free, we say free
Those emotions left uncovered, my dear
An echo, an echo of our time stands before us
Lust is in how she looks just like you, my dear

I said I CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN
I CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN
I found my love and I
I don't wanna lose it again

I said I CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN
I CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN
I found my love and I
I don't wanna lose it again

No, I don't wanna lose you now
No, I don't wanna lose you now
No, I don't wanna lose you now
No, I don't wanna lose you now

No, I don't wanna lose you now
No, I don't wanna lose you now
No, I don't wanna lose you now
No, I don't wanna lose you now
