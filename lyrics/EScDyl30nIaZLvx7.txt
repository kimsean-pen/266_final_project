spend my money at the movies
every day to see your face
you are graceful you are funny
i love everything you say
motorcycle riding i am dying
im a basket case
i want you to know
i love you the most
i want you to know
i love you
you look so perfect in that shirt
you look so perfect in that shirt
you look so perfect in that shirt
i will never let you hurt
no
lover of mine
youre in my dream last night
heavy sigh
bright light construction site
i was running tripping in the
football field its dark outside
sipping on my purple sports drink
got a voicemail its from clive
dig you up with yellow shovel
swear to god you are alive
ribbon wearing red in color
i wear black clothes as disguise
i want you to know
i love you the most
i want you to know
i love you
you look so perfect in that shirt
you look so perfect in that shirt
you look so perfect in that shirt
i will never let you hurt
no
