Don't you ever blind me
Don't be a foolish thief
Am I?
Don't you ever bring yourself to grief
Don't you ever blind me
Don't ever trick my mind
Did I?
Don't you think that you can lie to me
Did I lie?

Fortuna exprimitur artibus falsis
Et mendacem memorem esse oportet

If he is your moon, I will be your earth
To which you can return safely or injured

I feel only misery for myself when I
Look through the eyes of someone else

Don't you choke and bind me
Don't be a bleeding heart
Am I?
Fold and walk away or play your cards
Let us play!

Fortuna exprimitur artibus falsis
Et mendacem memorem esse oportet

If he is your moon, I will be your earth
To which you can return safely or injured

I feel only misery for myself when I
Look through the eyes of someone else
I can't even recognize the path which has to be
Taken to enter infinity

Don't you dare me
I dare you (you don't care about me)
I care about you (don't you touch me)
Liar

Fortuna exprimitur artibus falsis
Et mendacem memorem esse oportet

Adoratio permanebit
Quotiens me eges, adero

I prefer to be unhappy with you
Rather than being depressed without you
I belong to someone, I'm dedicated to
Nothing lasts forever, but you, you do

I prefer to be a liar just like you
To fulfill my deepest desires
I belong to someone I'm dedicated to
But all that I desire is you

One thoughtless moment passes in slow motion
As I lie down I realise that
All I wish is to get rid of this obsessive devotion

Venia ad vitam aeternam
Non mibi, non tibi, sed nobis

Hit me as you can
Beat me as you wish
Liar

Fortuna mutua coniuncti
Per tota saecula futura

I've raised myself for you
But now I regret

Venia ad vitam aeternam

This is the end
