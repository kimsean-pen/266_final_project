We're much too young and life's so big
We don't know yet
What the future brings in it's hands for us
What tomorrow brings, the future knows

No matter what you say
No matter what you do
We are united

Young and proud
Young and proud
We're marching on the same side of destiny
On the same side of destiny

Anyway anyway, you do it wrong
I'm calling out your name but you never hear me
Anyway anyway, you do it wrong
I'm giving you my love though it's never for sale

[Incomprehensible] young and proud

Anyway anyway, you do it wrong
I'm calling out your name
I'm calling out your name
I'm calling out your name

Anyway anyway, you do it wrong
I'm calling out your name
I'm calling out your name
I'm calling out your name
I'm calling out your name
I'm calling, calling out your name

Anyway anyway, you do it wrong
I'm calling out your name but you never hear me
Anyway anyway, you do it wrong
I'm giving you my love though it's never for sale

Anyway anyway, you do it wrong
I'm calling out your name but you never hear me
Anyway anyway, you do it wrong
I'm giving you my love though it's never for sale

Anyway anyway, you do it wrong
I'm calling out your name but you never hear me
Anyway anyway, you do it wrong
I'm giving you my love though it's never for sale
