How did they hide?
Crowded in rooms
Where shadows cast. They found disguise
Contoured by light
We're building a town that will lean to one side

Focus our lies
Behind our backs. Sharpen our knives
Armor and suits
We all fit together but they need to die

Long nose lies

Not paranoid
Seeing shapes in the walls

Hairless, limp and paralyzed

Not embarrassed to say who we are
Shout it out loud

Hairless, limp and paralyzed
