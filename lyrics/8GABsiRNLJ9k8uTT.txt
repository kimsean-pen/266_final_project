I spend my whole life walkin' on a tightrope
Won't drop the ball, oh oh oh oh
'Cause I wonder where it might go
Don't have it all, all all all all
Figured out what you're talking out the side for
I been walkin' on a tightrope
I spend my whole life walkin' on a tightrope
Won't drop the ball, oh oh oh oh
'Cause I wonder where it might go
Don't have it all, all all all all
Figured out what you're talking out the side for
I been walkin' on a tightrope

You know I'm gonna keep my balance
On my soul, gotta grow, indigo, I'm magic
Can't fuck with someone who can let me forget
You know that I'm right, all the things that I said
You call me at night, I'm the only one left
Want me to say it's alright, he done messed with your head
We're drunk off the Henn then we mess in your bed
Try to push me away then you pull me back in
Is this what you call love? I don't want none
Got to stay up, can't fall for none
What you call love, I don't want none
Got to stay up, can't fall off

I spend my whole life walkin' on a tightrope
Won't drop the ball, oh oh oh oh
'Cause I wonder where it might go
Don't have it all, all all all all
Figured out what you're talking out the side for
I been walkin' on a tightrope

I know it don't seem like
I found my peace, but I
Been walking more steady every second since I left
Steady pickin' up the piece I find at every step
And I'm only gonna get more
'Cause I'm doing what I'm supposed to
Planets told me that I'm special
And they told me that so are you
But you won't step up
So tell me how the stars gon' bless us
I walk with my chest up
Shoulders back, tight gut
Hahaha, hahaha
You pull me this way, push me that way
Girl I really hope you know I can't stay

I spend my whole life walkin' on a tightrope
Won't drop the ball, oh oh oh oh
'Cause I wonder where it might go
Don't have it all, all all all all
Figured out what you're talking out the side for
I been walkin' on a tightrope
I spend my whole life walkin' on a tightrope
Won't drop the ball, oh oh oh oh
'Cause I wonder where it might go
Don't have it all, all all all all
Figured out what you're talking out the side for
I been walkin' on a tightrope
