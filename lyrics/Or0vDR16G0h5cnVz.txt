They turn the lights down low
In shadows hiding from the world
Only coming out when it gets cold
The seas part when they hit the floor
The voices carry on and out the door
Everything you touch turns into gold

And like the angel you are
Your laugh creating a lightness in my chest
Your eyes they penetrate me
(Your answer's always "maybe")
And that's when I got up and left

A beating heart and a microphone
A ticking clock in an empty home
Still tells of these times so long ago
And even though I've come so far
I know I've got so far to go
And any day now I'll explode

Like the angel you are
Your laugh creating a lightness in my chest
And your eyes they penetrate me
(Your answer's always "maybe")
And that's when I got up and left

And each and every day will lead into tomorrow
Tomorrow brings one less day without you
So don't wait up just leave the light on
'Cause all the roads that I might take
Will all one day lead back to you

And like the angel you are
Your laugh creating a lightness in my chest
Your eyes they penetrate me
(Never cease to amaze me)
And that's when I got up and left
And that's when I got up and left
