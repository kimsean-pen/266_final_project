First time I saw your face I knew I was meant for you.
First time you said my name I knew I was meant for you.

Love, they say, it heals all wounds,
Love removes the hurt in you,
Love, I know that this is true.
Love, they say that it is blind,
Love, they say it all the time,
Love, I know that they are right.
Love, they say this

You don't need to wonder if love will make us stronger,
There's nothing love can't do.
Love, they say this,
You don't need to worry, this love will make us worthy
There's nothing love can't do.

First time you held my hand I knew I was meant for you
First time you kissed my lips I knew I was meant for you.

Love, they say there's only one,
Love, the kind that's not undone,
Love, know you are the one.
Love, they say this

You don't need to wonder if love will make us stronger,
There's nothing love can't do.
Love, they say this,
You don't need to worry, this love will make us worthy
There's nothing love can't do

I know they say that we're crazy,
Don't leave, there's nothing love can't do.
I know you'll say that we're crazy.

Love, they say it heals all wounds,
Love removes the hurt in you,
Love, I know that this is true.
Love, they say it's only one,
Love, the kind that's not undone,
Love, I know you are the one

You don't need to wonder if love will make us stronger,
There's nothing love can't do.
Love, they say this,
You don't need to worry, this love will make us worthy
There's nothing love can't do.

You don't need to wonder if love will make us stronger,
There's nothing love can't do.
Love, they say this,
You don't need to worry, this love will make us worthy
There's nothing love can't do
There's nothing love can't do
There's nothing love can't do
