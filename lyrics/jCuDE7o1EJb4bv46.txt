These are the sentiments of a cold-blooded cynic
So believe me when I say I would love nothing more
Than for everything to end unpleasantly
Concrete shoes, rising tides
Grey skies, let none survive
Don't say I didnt warn you

I would rather see your face in Hell
Than speak another word of this perfect world
I would rather see your face in Hell
Than speak another word of this perfect world

Oh, to be buried beneath the waves
A sailor's grave, it's all I crave
Bury me five thousand fathoms deep
And leave my bones for the depths

The sharpest teeth await our skin
The sharpest teeth await
Bloodlust swarms upon our worthless existence

The devil's teeth
The devil's teeth beneath our skin
Whispering of silent vengeance
Blood debts remain unpaid

Now every breath of life has been betrayed
Every ideal has rusted through
Nothing we hold brings solace
(Feed us to the sharks)
So let nothing remain
(Feed us to the sea)

To be buried beneath the waves
A sailor's grave, it's all I crave
Bury me five thousand fathoms deep
And leave my bones for the depths

There's blood in the water
Sinking, always sinking
There's blood in the water
Sinking, always sinking
There's blood in the water

I would rather see your face in Hell
Than speak another word of this perfect fucking world
