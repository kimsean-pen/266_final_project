Sworn to fast with all my might
The clay was soft, the future bright
Old fashioned ways that won't erase
Out of control this building gate

Blinded like new
I'm feeling much stranger 'bout you
Blinded like new
I'm feeling much stranger 'bout you

Despite the shape this twisted form
With open arms into the storm
Kept me, kept and wanting more
I saw you peaking through the door

Blinded like new
I'm feeling much stranger 'bout you
Blinded like new
I'm feeling much stranger 'bout you
