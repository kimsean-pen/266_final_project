Stay with me, patiently
'Til I come around
But I won't be, tied to dreams
Not my own

I know I promised that I would come through
Despite all my fear of committing my time to you
You're giving me love, I just can't see it now
Like each of your words go in one ear and out
Oh please, oh please

Pull me close and let me go
I can't be your hand to hold
Let me know life on my own
Cut your ropes and let me go

I don't know what I need
But I know
That you can't bring enough for me
To settle down

I promised that I would come through
Despite all my fear of committing my time to you
You're giving me love, I just can't see it now
Like each of your words go in one ear and out
Oh please, oh please

Pull me close and let me go
I can't be your hand to hold
Let me know life on my own
Cut your ropes and let me go
Pull me close and let me go

You're waiting for flames
That won't ever come home
Keep safely at bay but never returned
Tell me I can change and some day I'll grow
Into a woman that knows how to love
You so hold me
And show that I can be lonely and complete

Pull me close and let me go
I can't be your hand to hold
Let me know life on my own
Cut your ropes and let me go
Pull me close and let me go
I can't be your hand to hold
Let me know life on my own
Cut your ropes and let me go
Pull me close and let me go
