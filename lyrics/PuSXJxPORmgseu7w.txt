The time is right you and I
We will fight the final battle
Gone away the bond of passion
Death of faith, left aggression

We sworn the oath, now it is broken
Gone away with deception
I'll root out the nest of rebellion
Wage of sin, total subjection

The ancient law from the old union - obedience!

In the face of judge you regret
Sue for mercy before the creating
Remove the one for me to end
Only way to endless purity

Now you find the path of rightness
Opens the gate to deepest openness
True peace in the place of paradise
Will decay

Whiplash, flowing tears
Resumed respect
Supreme power
Beats the evil out of you
