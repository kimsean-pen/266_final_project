Too far away from the city
Some kids left on the road
They said we have a communist in the family
I had to wear a mask

Too far away from the city
We had to make this room
Fathers were football players, formal works, policemen
What the mothers did I didn't know

Music tonight
I just want your music tonight

I saw her body organ
She was laughing while pressing the keys
She said my favourite book was dirty and
"You shouldn't shout, you can read."

Too far away from the city
We never heard its noise
We learned how to stay fit and things like
Green-tones hide the blush

Music tonight
I just want your music tonight
Music tonight
I just want your music tonight

Too far away from the city
We came to breathe clean air
Nature left a safe oasis
And the mothers walked towards the forest

Music tonight
I just want your music tonight
Music tonight
I just want your music tonight
