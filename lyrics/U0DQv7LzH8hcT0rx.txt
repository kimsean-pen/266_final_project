They came to conquer, all they wanted was to watch us suffer
Should have known what doesn't kill me, only makes us stronger
They came to conquer, all they wanted was to watch us suffer
Should have known what doesn't kill me, only makes us stronger

Some say we brought this upon ourselves
Overlooked the cracks, never heard the cries for help
I have no one to blame but myself
Whispers in the wind, shared all our sins and secrets
They came to conquer (They Came to conquer)
Not for glory or a hero's return
All they want is to watch us crash and burn

Vultures above and sharks below are waiting for us to fall
In hope that they'll catch you and ruin it all
Circling us from head to toe
We're swimming in the shallows arguing to and from
There's bad blood in the air
This killer instincts the only thing we'll ever share

We are the creators of our own demise. They took to the seas
They took to the skies. Only had eyes for my prize possessions
(Turned all my confessions into lies)
All they want is to watch us crash and burn
All they want is to watch us crash and burn

This is what it feels like to be in the jaws of defeat
One thousand teeth. Slowly sinking in

Vultures above and sharks below are waiting for us to fall
In hope that they'll catch you and ruin it all
Circling us from head to toe
We're swimming in the shallows arguing to and from
There's bad blood in the air
This killer instincts the only thing we'll ever share

They came to conquer, all they wanted was to watch us suffer
They came to conquer, all they wanted was to watch us suffer
Watch us suffer
