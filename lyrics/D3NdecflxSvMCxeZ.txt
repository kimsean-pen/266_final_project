Now, now, now wait a minute y'all
This dance ain't for everybody
Only the sexy people
So all you fly mothers
Get on out there and dance
Dance I said

Salt and Pepa's here, and we're in effect
Want you to push it, babe
Coolin' by day, then at night, working up a sweat
C'mon girls, let's go show the guys that we know
How to become number one in a hot party show
Now push it

Ah, push it - push it good
Ah, push it - push it real good
Ah, push it - push it good
Ah, push it - p-push it real good

Yeah, you, come here, gimme a kiss
Better make it fast or else I'm gonna get pissed
Can't you hear the music pumpin' hard like I wish you would
Now push it
Push it good
Push it real good
Push it good
P-push it real good
