She came from heaven
Well there's no point belaboring that
I've seen some trouble and
I must admit that I'm in demand
I confront rejection with magnetic
Good intentions and yet
Hey Jack, get back in fact
Don't do that

I act sharp, but feel uncertain
'Cause next time, it could be curtains

Evangeline
Conspirator so fine
Lend me your faith
'Cause mine is broken
Compared to mine
What is your crime
Evangeline?

Now just to be certain
Let's be sure to set the record straight
I could use an angel
But I don't intend to split
Up the take

Never go for treason
But I got reasons that
Don't warrant debate
My act's intact and in
Fact, you're not all that

You act sure, but your uncertain
'Cause next time, it could be curtains

Evangeline
Conspirator so fine
Lend me your faith
'Cause mine is broken
Compared to mine
What is your crime
Evangeline?

Well there's no use turning back
It's already much too late
When the house is burning!

Evangeline
Conspirator so fine
Lend me your faith
'Cause mine is broken
Compared to mine
What is your crime
Evangeline
