Time to step outside, time to step outside
Time to step out, time to step out
Time to step outside, time to step outside
Time to step outside you

House on fire, leave it all behind you

Dark as night, let the lightning guide you

Time to step outside, time to step outside
Time to step outside you

House on fire, leave it all behind you.
Living life, feeding appetites.
Stayed through every hard stop, every go.
Being bland
Breathing half the time.
House on fire, leave it all behind you.
Dark as night, let the lightning guide you

Time to step outside, time to step outside
Time to step out, time to step out

Broke tooth Monday
Something's not the same
Blank head, crossed eyes sweep the floor.
Feel your presence
in your absence shut the door.
House on fire, leave it all behind you
Dark as night, let the lightning guide you
Time to step outside, time to step outside
Time to step out
