I don't wanna grow old
Sit together on a swingset
And talk about how
I wanna be a tadpole

I wanna tell you
All the things
I never told you
I didn't want to ruin everything
But I still
Ruin everything

We'll build pillow forts
On my parents' floor
Keep things out
Talk about
All the things
that make my bones sore

I guess I'm just afraid
I'll never grow my legs
And that it might annoy you
(The way I do)
And that it could be true
(I know it's true)
I want to tell you
I want to tell you
