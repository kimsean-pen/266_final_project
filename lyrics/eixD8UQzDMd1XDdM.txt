Deceased in mind, decree of death
Blackened heart baptized in fire
Exertion now, need to blitz
Vicious ways brought up in Hell

Draw the line, life or death
Potent thrust, excessive pain
Massive dose, adrenalin
Minor threat, can not decline

Stricken to live, Hell on Earth
Shackled and bound we lie
Praise of death, life's a dream
We're only living to die

Victim of life, insanity lives
Deep in shock, intensive care
Tables turned, blast of strength
Kill at once, time to prevail

Begin to crank, feel the rush
Start to rage, take to extremes
Push too far, overkill
Time to die, no way to win

Stricken to live, Hell on Earth
Shackled and bound we lie
Praise of death, life's a dream
We're only living to die

Running and hunting and slashing and crushing
And searching and seeing and stabbing and shooting
Thrashing and smashing and burning, destroying
And killing and bleeding and pleading then death

At Mach ten velocity
Pressure builds, can't take the strain
Life blood flows to its grave
Dripping sweat, death shall erase

Time to think, time to breathe
Feel the pulse, life will expire
Surging speed, hell a fast
Cardiac cease to exist

Stricken to live, Hell on Earth
Shackled and bound we lie
Praise of death, life's a dream
We're only living to die
