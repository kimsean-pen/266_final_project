See it startled
Afternoon I had to ask or dare I ever know
Tell us, we are demented
Watch as attention span
Hold so fast then goes up in smoke

I don't think you're nervous enough
It happened to show its own face
Search for the soulless ends
Now point him towards rest

Culprits, shudder apparitions left in time
If we're honest, sight unknown
Crowing, frozen, bedroom
Awoke up certain lays a tomb
Her tree holds it, unbeknownst still sending chills

I don't think you're nervous enough
It happened to show its own face
Search for the soulless ends
Now point him towards rest

You won't find me curling up
A place that should make sense
Well, excuse me for this better judgment
Night is so worth waiting for

A blinding scare so cauterizing
Arms out pointing sit and stare at
This proof, this living proof
This proof, this living proof

Suns up, braver
Hands and legs untouched
Before we forget
Save this unaging proof

I don't think you're nervous enough
It happened to show its own face
Search for the soulless ends
Now point him towards

I don't think you're nervous enough
It happened to show its own face
Search for the soulless ends
Now point him towards rest
