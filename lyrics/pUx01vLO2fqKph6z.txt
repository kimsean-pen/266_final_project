What's with the drugs these days?
These days I don't feel nothing
Unless our bodies touching, babe
This ain't my best, oh no
Go get the bartender
Fix me up something better, babe

If I can't get high
No, I can't get high no more
No, I can't get high, no, I can't get high
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love

I love these drugs, they ain't enough
They don't do what your body does
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love
I love these drugs, they ain't enough
I can't get high without your love

I can't get high, oh no, oh no
I can't get high without your love

You got me unwind, uh-huh
Now you're the only reason
We go downtown on the weekend, babe
What's up with the drugs? They don't
No, they don't feel the same
Ain't calling my dealer
'Cause I got you feeling my body, babe (my body, babe)

'Cause I can't get high
No, I can't get high no more
No, I can't get high, no, I can't get high

I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love
I love these drugs, they ain't enough
They don't do what your body does
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love
I love these drugs, they ain't enough
I can't get high without your love

I can't get high, oh no, oh no
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high, oh no, oh no
I can't get high without your love

What's up with the drugs?
These days, these days
You got me unwind
I can't, I can't

I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love
I love these drugs, they ain't enough
They don't do what your body does
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love
I love these drugs, they ain't enough
I can't get high without your love
(I can't get)

I need it so bad, I need it so bad
I'm never sober, I need it, I need it
I need it so bad, I need it so bad
I'm never sober, I need it, I need it
(So good, I need it so bad)
(So good, I need it so bad)
