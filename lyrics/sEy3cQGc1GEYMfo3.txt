And I want you to know, I took it with me
But when things are thrown away, like they are daily

Time passes in the constant state
So if that is how it is

I don't wanna be a star
But a stone on the shore
Long door, frame the wall
When everything's overgrown

But what she really really wanted was my rights in the rooms
And I wouldn't understand that I would try to play alone

And I want you to know, I took it with me
But when things are thrown away, like they are daily

Time passes in the constant state
So if that is how it is

I don't wanna be a star
But a stone on the shore
Long door, frame the wall
When everything's overgrown

But what she really really wanted was my rights in the rooms
And I wouldn't understand that I would try to play alone

And I want you to know, I took it with me
But when things are thrown away, like they are daily

Time passes in the constant state
So if that is how it is

I don't wanna be a star
But a stone on the shore
Long door, frame the wall
When everything's overgrown

But what she really really wanted was my rights in the rooms
And I wouldn't understand that I would try to play alone

And I wouldn't understand that I would try to play alone And I want you to know, I took it with me
But when thing are thrown away, like they are daily

Time passes in the constant state
