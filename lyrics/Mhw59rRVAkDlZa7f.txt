I'm lying in my bed, the blanket is warm
This body will never be safe from harm
Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal
Touch my skin to keep me whole

If only you'd come back to me
If you laid at my side
Wouldn't need no mojo pin
To keep me satisfied

Don't want to weep for you
I don't want to know
I'm blind and tortured
The white horses flow
The memories fire
The rhythms fall slow
Black beauty, I love you so

Precious, precious silver and gold
And pearls in oyster's flesh
Drop down we two to serve and pray to love
Born again from the rhythm
screaming down from heaven

Ageless, ageless and I'm there in your arms
Don't want to weep for you
I don't want to know
I'm blind and tortured
The white horses flow
The memories fire
The rhythms fall slow

Black beauty, I love you so... so... so.

The welts of your scorn, my love, give me more
Send whips of opinion down my back, give me more

Well it's you I've waited my life to see
It's you I've searched so hard for
Don't want to weep for you
I don't want to know
I'm blind and tortured
The white horses flow
The memories fire
The rhythms fall slow
Black beauty, I love you so
