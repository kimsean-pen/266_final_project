Slipped away to the open
And watched the shadows deface the ground
'Til the day we all believe that we might lose control
Will the moment we fear, turn to everything clear?

After you're gone away from the life of the planet you're on
And everything after loaded awake
Somebody spoke when I left here today
And everything after and everything after

It pulls us back into orbit
When disorder surrounds this place and it brings us down
We can't keep our feet on the ground
Til the moment we fear, turns to everything clear

After you're gone away from the life of the planet you're on
And everything after loaded awake
Somebody spoke when I left here today
And everything after and everything after

We are down here, we are space, we are down here

Today we all believe that we might lose control
Will the moment we fear, turn to everything clear?

After you're gone away from the life of the planet you're on
And everything after loaded awake
Somebody spoke when I left here today
And everything after and everything after

And everything after
And everything after
And everything after
