You never know just what you've got
Till it's slipping through your fingers
Never know just what you've got
Till it's gone with the wind
And you never miss your shadow
Till there's no one left beside you
You never miss your shadow
Till you're alone, alone in the dark

You never know just what will break you
Till you're picking up the pieces
Never know just what will break you
Till your world, it falls apart
Never know how small your voice is
Till you're screaming at the silence
Never know how small your voice is

Till you're arguing, arguing with God

But I saw Death's face today
As he led my friend away
I saw Death's face today
As he cast his shadow over me
I saw Death's face today
As he led my friend away
So I'll ask who I gotta pay

To bring him back, bring him back to me
Bring him back to me

You never know the words you should've said until they're all you're left with
Until the dirt is falling and the guilt, it burns your bones
And we ask the biggest question: why the fuck did this all happen?
Who on Earth deserves this? And what the hell do we do now?
So we live like we have lost, and we love like we are broken
And as the colour leaves the sky, we're left in reverence of the frailty of it all
