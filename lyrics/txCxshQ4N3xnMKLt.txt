You look alive like there's colour inside
Your skeleton faces,
I'm sorry I'm so familiar
I forget that we're changing.
This is a trust fall, I couldn't commit
This is a trust fall, I couldn't commit.
You look alive like there's colour inside
You wither away

If you could see me now

I'm not the one who disconnected
To hurt someone was never my Intent-ions are wrong
Were you affected?
No, I'm not the one who disconnected
To hurt someone that was never my intent-ions are wrong
Were you affected?

It was an arbitrary kill (Awake when I'm dreaming)
A loosened heart corrodes the shield (Count the bones in the ceiling)
Why are we arguing to feel (Awake when I'm dreaming)
A loosened love?
The chambers heal (Count the bones in the ceiling)

If you could see me now
I'd hold you responsible
I'm awake when I'm dreaming
Count the bones in the ceiling

You look alive like there's colour inside
Your skeleton faces
I'm sorry I'm so familiar I forget that we're changing
This is a trust fall, I couldn't commit
This is a trust fall, I couldn't commit
You look a live like there's colour inside
You wither away

Cemetary in me
Cut my bones, crystalline
Skeleton marrow key
Cemetary in me

You look alive, your apathy betrays you
Cadaver lungs I know you cannot breath in
You disconnect but your bones remain
It's the same damn thing
It's the same damn thing

To cut my heart, survive on muscle memory
Obscure the vampire feeding off my energy
I feel the key turn across my soul and I know

If you could see me now
You'd catch me in the death spiral
If you could see me now
You'd catch me in the death spiral
If you could see me now
You'd catch me in the death spiral
If you could see me now
You'd catch me in the death spiral
(You look alive like there's colour inside)
