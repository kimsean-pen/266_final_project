Fittin' in your vibe and you be stylin' out too quickly
Man it's just the way you do it when you move so swiftly
Vibin' out to you, it makin' me too human
Smokin' out the way I feel emotion
Emotion
So good it's so bad, it's so bad it's so new
I'm wishin' at the end of June

Clouds in my shroud in my vision grow clearly
Can't see ahead if I'm fine when I leave me
What is the sayin' when you should let go
What is so impossible?
Do me like that with a smile, with a smack
With a you nose, you know me, no you know me better

No rainy, no windy, no sun
Just music and just with the one
I'm fine like that, fine like that, fine
I never be losin', I've won every time

No, you know knows me no better like that
Fittin' in, your styling out too quickly
Man it's in the way you do when you move so swiftly
Vibin' out to you make me too human
Smokin' out the way I feel emotion
It's so good it's so bad, it's so bad it's so new
Wishin' at the end of June
Clouds in my shroud in my vision grow clearly
Can't see ahead if I'm fine when I be leavin' me
What is the sayin' when you let go
What is so impossible though?
Do me like that with a smile, with a smack
With all your nose you know better like that
When we be on the scene when ya gottem
Wingin' me weather

No rainy, no windy, no sun
Just music and just with the one
I'm fine like, that fine like that, fine
I never be losin', I've won every time

No it's
Up from above it don't leave me behind
It's around all the Earth, and we know it's divine, yes
When I'll be emptyin' all of my mind, i see
