I always admit it, pity,
'Cause I was getting lonely
Oh oh, I was lonely
Oh baby without you
I always, I hid it, pity,
I needed you to hold me
Oh boy, you shoulda known me
I didn't know how to...

Gone are the days of magic
Those times were cool
I tried to make love, not hate
What was I to do?
Oh, The Police were playing
We danced all night
We were kissing til dark,
Turned to light.

Ah-ooh, rolling back the rivers in time,
Can't wait, got to see his face somewhere.
Ah-ooh, holding back the minutes gone by,
Someday, got to see his face, oh yeah.

There's a feeling in my soul,
That sets my heart alight
I tell you, there's a feeling in my soul,
That tells me you're all mine
There's an arrow in my heart,
You sent at seventeen
I tell you there's a shadow in my heart,
That tells of what could've been

Ah-ooh, rolling back the rivers in time,
Can't wait, got to see his face somewhere.
Ah-ooh, holding back the minutes gone by,
Someday, got to see his face, oh yeah.

Doesn't really matter, I fell nothing better at all (ooh oooh)
Sending him a letter, I know I won't regret it at all (ooh oooh)
It doesn't really matter, a miracle can happen for sure (ooh oooh)
I'd rather wait forever, babe, then never have it at all

Ah-ooh, rolling back the rivers in time,
Can't wait, got to see his face somewhere.
Ah-ooh, holding back the minutes gone by,
Someday, got to see his face, oh yeah.

Ah-ooh, rolling back the rivers in time,
Can't wait, got to see his face somewhere.
Ah-ooh, holding back the minutes gone by,
Someday, got to see his face, oh yeah.
