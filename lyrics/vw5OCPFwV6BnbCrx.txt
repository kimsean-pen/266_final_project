You took me to your little crib
Guess it must have been a big deal
Got me starring in your wet dream
Now it's time to get real
I'm not looking for love
No not today
But you call me up and had the nerve to say
See you next Tuesday

You call me a bitch like it's a bad thing
You call me a freak like that means something
Can't get your way so you insult me
I think we know the rest
Get it off your chest
I don't give a shit
I love it when you call me a bitch like it's a bad thing

You show up everywhere I go
Get a grip you're acting so weird
I don't need your j√§ger bombs
I think I can take it from here
You got to learn to leave when the party ends
I don't really care what you tell your friends
Tell me again

You call me a bitch like it's a bad thing
You call me a freak like that means something
Can't get your way so you're angry
I think we know the rest
Get it off your chest
I don't give a shit
I love it when you call me a bitch

I think you hate me because you want me
You only want what you can't have
I'm just being who I want to be
But you can't deal with that

You call me a bitch like it's a bad thing
You call me a freak like that means something
Can't get your way so you're so pissed off
I think we know the rest
Get it off your chest
I don't give a shit
I love it when you call me a bitch like it's a bad thing
