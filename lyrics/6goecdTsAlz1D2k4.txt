"She-rocker you're wasting your time
'Cause you're only a girl"
She-rocker sacked the factory line for a chance of a dance in a surreal world

She said, "come rescue, rescue me from this Hollywood life
Come rescue, rescue me from this Hollywood life"

She-rocker hear the audience scream for the death of the king
But a hand-job is all the butchery brings
'Cause fame ain't as easy as him (how sad)

Oh, come rescue, rescue me from this Hollywood life
Come rescue, rescue me from this Hollywood life

Come take this Hollywood life
