How can you just stand there and stare?
The world burns, alight the air
Fire of passion, ignite
Open yourselves to fight

To reignite the will
Deafening call to kill

The structure of archetype
Abhorrence
To collapse all I've learned
To absorb with open eyes to see this
Revelation, new serenity
Destruction, disharmony
To see this, I'll wait for you
To rise from this dream
I will be waiting for you
To rise from this...

Gazing at twilights whole
Arms raised, chant, extol

The structure of archetype
Abhorrence
To collapse all I've learned
To absorb with open eyes to see this
Revelation, new serenity
Destruction, disharmony
To see this, I'll wait for you
To rise from this dream
I will be waiting for you
To rise from this dream

If our world ended today would you suffer?
Or just sit there awaiting damnation

How can you just stand there and stare?
The world burns, alight the air

The structure of archetype
Abhorrence
To collapse all I've learned
To absorb with open eyes to see this
Revelation, new serenity
Destruction, disharmony
To see this, I'll wait for you
To rise from this dream
I will be waiting for you
To rise from this dream
