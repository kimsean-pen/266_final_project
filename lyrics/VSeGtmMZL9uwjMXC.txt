Night has fallen
Mute and cold
My horse is crying

But you know all this time
But you know all this time
That you'd never want
Keep you still

Dare to come
But you love me still
But you love me
Tears too cold

La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la

You are the name
And you're the one
That you're forever
Indistinct

But you know
That there's strength
And you love a man
Who stewed out these tears

Tears to come
That you love the tears
And you love the tears
Still too cold

La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
...
