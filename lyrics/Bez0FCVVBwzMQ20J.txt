The frame
The friction
It's the reason that we all become aware
And we change
For no reason
Some say it's better to fall asleep and disappear
It's time we finally look at what we've done
And wake up

So here we are
We're waiting for a fall
And on the radio they're calling on satellites
Like they're going to save us all

So here we are
I guess I'm praying after all
We're calling all, calling all satellites
This is a wake up call

A call for freedom
Is that the reason that we are alive?
And we waste, (we waste) our lives on the wasted
Until there's nothing for us left to justify

Oh, I don't get it

So here we are
We're waiting for a fall
And on the radio they're calling on satellites
Like they're going to save us all
So here we are
I guess I'm praying after all
We're calling all, calling all satellites
This is a wake up call

Change
No reason
Some say it's better to fall asleep and disappear
It's time we finally open up our eyes

Here we are
We're waiting for a fall
And on the radio they're calling on satellites
Like they're going to save us all

So here we are
I guess I'm praying after all
We're calling all, calling all satellites
This is a wake up call
