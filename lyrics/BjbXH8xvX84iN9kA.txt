Reeling again
With back against the wall
Don't look down, don't be afraid to fall
Lost and found and barely hanging on
Made a big sound

But you never had a reason, oh
And you're never gonna win, no
Feeling low
The penalty of sin, oh
Leave it alone
Cause we're never gonna win, no
Feeling goes

(Breathe)

Lies don't last long
You spread yourself too thin
Then you're gone, believing your own shit
Won't be long 'til they're pulling on your string
Then it's done

'Cause you never had a reason, oh
And you're never gonna win, no
Feeling low
The penalty of sin, oh
Leave it alone
'Cause we're never gonna win, no
Feeling goes
