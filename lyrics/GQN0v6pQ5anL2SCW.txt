You said you'd marry me if I was 23
But I'm one that you can't see if I'm only 18
Tell me who makes these rules
Obviously not you, who are you answering to?

Oh, Jenny don't be hasty
No, don't treat me like a baby
Let me take you where you'll let me
Because leaving just upsets me

And I'll be around again to see these other men
That are more adequate in the age department
And I did not think you'd care, there'd be no problems here
But now you're looking at me like you're disgusted

Then I'm definitely waiting for you to smile
And change your mind then I'll say I'm sorry
And I'll wrap my arms 'round your body, I really hope
That you forgive in a hurry and don't just ask me to leave

Oh, Jenny don't be hasty
No, don't treat me like a baby
Let me take you where you'll let me
Because leaving just upsets me

Oh, Jenny you are crazy
First I'm perfect then I'm lazy
And I was calling you my baby
Now it sounds like you just left me and it kills me

Oh, Jenny don't be hasty
No, don't treat me like a baby
Let me take you where you'll let me
Because leaving just upsets me
Oh, Jenny you are crazy
First I'm perfect then I'm lazy
And I was calling you my baby
Now it sounds like you just left me and it kills me
You said you'd marry me if I was 23
But I'm one that you can't see if I'm only 18
