Feel the sun above me
Close my eyes, so heavy
You look so much like a jewel
What's a life like with no love?
There ain't hurt in a pure love
Let me swim in your lagoon

I caught a glimpse of you so bright
Like a crystal light
Like a jewel up in the sky
Baby I've been waiting for your sign

Feel the sun above me
Close my eyes, so heavy
You look so much like a jewel
What's a life like with no love?
There ain't hurt in a pure love
There ain't hurt in a pure love

I caught a glimpse of you so bright
Like a crystal light
Like a jewel up in the sky
Baby I've been waiting for your sign
I caught a glimpse of you so bright
Like a crystal light
Like a jewel up in the sky
Baby I've been waiting for your sign
