Me and the farmer get on fine
Through stormy weather and bottles of wine
If I pull my weight he'll treat me well
But if I'm late he'll give me hell
And thought its all hard work no play
Farmer is a happy crook
Jesus hates him everyday
cause jesus gave him farm

(Won'the let you go?) probably no
(Won'the let you go?) probably no
(Why does he treat you so?) I just dont know
(Why does he treat you so?) I just dont know
Me and the farmer like brother, like sister
Getting on like hand and blister
Me and the farmer

He's chopped down sheep, planted trees
And helped the countryside to breathe
Ripped up fields, bullied flocks
And worked his workers right around the clock

It may seem strange but he'd admit
Intentions aren't exactly true
And through God loves his wife a bit
He hates the farmer through and through

(Won'the let you go?) probably no
(Won'the let you go?) probably no
(Why does he treat you so?) I just dont know
(Why does he treat you so?) I just dont know
Me and the farmer like brother, like sister
Getting on like hand and blister
Me and the farmer

All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All we've got is london zoo
cause farmer owns them all

(Won'the let you go?) probably no
(Won'the let you go?) probably no
(Why does he treat you so?) I just dont know
(Why does he treat you so?) I just dont know
Me and the farmer like brother, like sister
Getting on like hand and blister
Me and the farmer
Me and the farmer
Me and the farmer
