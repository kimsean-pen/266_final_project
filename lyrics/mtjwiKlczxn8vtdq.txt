From the red sky of the east
To the sunset in the west

We have cheated death
And he has cheated us

But that was just a dream
And this is what it means
We are sleeping
And we'll dream for evermore

And the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows remain with our hands
Deeper gray, came to mourn

All the colors of the dawn
Will this journeyman's day be his last?

I know what I want
I'll say what I want

And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
But the memory still remains

All the past years not so strange
Our winter times are
Like a silent shroud
And the heartbeat of the day
Drives the mist away
And winter's not
The only dream around
In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then the journeyman's day has begun
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then the journeyman's day has begun
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
