All this time
All my life dedicated to love you, in silence
Don't nobody knows just how much I feel for you
Eats me up inside and I know how hard up I got
Still gonna know
Just give me one night and I will let it go
Just give me one night and I can let it go

Could have been my saviour, my one and only
But it's just as simple as love, you ain't gotta phone me
And I know what I beg, I still get a no
Just give me one night and I will let it go
Just give me one night and I will let it go

Let me love you (let me love you)
Let me love you, oh let me love you
Let me love you (let me love you)
Let me love you

You know I'm scared at looking at you
Scared what you might see
I feel it's written all over me
My body wants you, my soul needs you
Don't know if I
Just let me fuck you and I can let it go, mm

Let me love you (let me love you)
Let me love you
Let me love you (let me love you)
Let me love you (only one I)
