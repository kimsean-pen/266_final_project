I'm starting all over
I began with the words but now they're gone
If you all would sing along
I laid out the story
But I should've known the story would go all wrong
If the world would sing along

I think that you know when it's time for you to go
I'll stand and refrain

Never finished the end
We were at the beginning when I began
Story was getting good when I heard your voice so clear say
"So long my friend"

I think that you know when it's time for you to go
I'll stand and refrain
Although I never really knew you
I'm prepared to show you that
I'll take all the blame
I'll stand and refrain

Shouldn't have held on so tight
If I dare to beg I can't and now I see why
I take all the blame
Why I lie about the way I've been begging you to stay

I think that you know when it's time for you to go
I'll stand and refrain although I never really knew you
I'm prepared to show you that
I'll take all the blame
I'll stand and refrain
