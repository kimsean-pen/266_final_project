Give it to, to give it to me, baby
To give it to me, baby

You don't have to give me rings on my fingers
Promise me the moon and the stars in the sky
Or bring me roses just to show me you love me
That ain't gonna win this heart of mine

All the diamonds you can buy won't impress me
Pretty words ain't gonna prove your love
I need more than just tokens of affection
I'm not asking for too much now baby

I don't need no fancy cars
Just need something from the heart...
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I need, a real emotion
Feel, gotta feel it inside
Give me, that real emotion
'Coz I need some, ('Coz I need some)
I need to feel some tonight
Give me a love that's genuine
Real emotion, real emotion

Show me something that my heart can believe in
Imitation love don't mean a thing, no, no
Baby it's got to be the real thing or nothing
Show me what's it gonna be now baby

I'm not asking much from you
Just a love that's deep and true...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I need, real emotion
Feel, gotta feel it inside
Give me, that real emotion
'Coz I need some, ('Coz I need some)
I need to feel some tonight
Give me a love that's genuine

(Not a cheap imitation of love)
(I need something that's real)
(I can feel in my heart baby)
I've been waiting so long, so long
(For a love, for a love, for a love that's strong)

Yeah, I don't need no fancy cars
Just need something from the heart...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I need...
(Feelin' inside)
('Coz I need some)

I need... real emotion
Give it to me, to give, to give it to me, baby
Oh, yeah
'Coz I need some ('coz I need some)

Give it to me baby, give it to me baby
To give it to me, baby
Real emotion
'Coz I need some, ('Coz I need some)
I need...
