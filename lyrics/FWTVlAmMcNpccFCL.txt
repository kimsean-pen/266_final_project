Through man's existence, from the start of time
The fight for survival is our only crime

Those in power, rotten to the core
The ongoing battle of the eternal war

What are you fighting for?
Is it worth dying for?
You're held down by your chains
There's no one but you to blame

Fighting, destroying, following blind
Crushing, corrupting, enslaving mankind

What's now left - you can't believe
Oppression those in power, send to deceive

Slave to hatred, peace they deplore
Driven by despair, eternal war

Rebuild humanity to create a new society
For there's strength in unity which lies with you
Can't you see
