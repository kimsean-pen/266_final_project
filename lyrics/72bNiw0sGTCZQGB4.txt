I'm sure I can do whatever you want
And if I try to be more than I am
Want to be strong in your arms
'Cause kissing you is something new for you and me both

I know it's more fun to give than to get
Learned it from you
Showing me why
Want to be strong in your arms
Kissing you... something new for you and me both

I'm sure it's okay
We're feeling this good
And we can feel as good as we do
Want to keep on doing
Kissing you is something new
For you and me both

I know it's more fun to give than to get
Learned it from you
Showing me why
Want to be strong in your arms
Kissing you something new for you and me both

I'm sure I can do whatever you want
And if I try to be more than I am
Want to be strong in your arms
Kissing you is something new for you and me both
