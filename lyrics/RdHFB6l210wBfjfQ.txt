she ain't got no money
her clothes are kinda funny
her hair is kinda wild and free
oh, but love grows where my rosemary goes
and nobody knows like me
she talks kinda lazy

and people say she she's crazy
and her life's a mystery
oh, but love grows where my rosemary goes
and nobody knows like me
there's something about her hand holding mine
it's a feeling that's fine

and i just gotta say
she's really got a magical spell
and it's working so well
that i can't get away
i'm a lucky fella
and i've just got to tell her
that i love her endlessly
