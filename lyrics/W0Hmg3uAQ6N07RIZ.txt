Onward to reach the wheel of time
A path of solitude
Embraced humbly
Hands, face and knees against the ground

Prostrations for existence to come
Winds of perpetuity
Through sails of vacuity
Shores of enlightenment
Are wished and found

Sand Mandala
of the enlightened mind
Sand Mandala
Pure wisdom, one, shall find

Kalachakra
Disclosing mystic hands
Kalachakra
Splendors of colored sands

Soon of this work art shall be
In the hands of ephemerality

Dismantled, will be
The wheel of time
Quiet intensity
The sands are poured at sea
Waves of enlightenment
Are blessed and found
