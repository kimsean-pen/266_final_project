Through these misty eyes
I see lonely skies
Lonely roads to Babylon
There's my family and my country
Heaven knows where i belong

Pack my bags tonight
Here's one Jacobite
Who must leave or surely die
Put me on a train
In the pouring rain
Say fairwell, don't say goodbye

Seagull carry me
Over land and sea
To my old folk
Thats where I wanna be

Every beat of my heart
Tears me furthur apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

One more glass of wine
Just for Auld Lang Sang
And the girl I left behind
How I miss you now, in my darkest hour
And the way, our arms entwined

Seagull carry me
Over land and sea
To my old folk
That's where I wanna be

Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and I'm alone in the dark
I'm going home

And we'll drink a toast
To the blood red rose
Tear awhile the Emerald Isle
Until the northern lights
And the swollen pipes
How they make a grown man cry

Seagull carry me
Over land and sea
To my Old Folk
That's where I wanna be

Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home
I'm going home
