Well now get out of my face
Locked here I can not escape
It's my life

What the hell is going on
The difference is that I can't change it
Everyday seem like it's worse than the day before
And I can't take it
I just want to erase the things I hate
And all the faces I see

Write, write in my face
Again and again
All I got fault this is nothing but hate
Write in my face
Feed in my rage
All I got fault is nothing but hate

I'm a ghost in the mist(It's my life)
My life slips away
I wander and see
I don't make any sounds
I'm lost in the mist
And I sure lead the way
Locked in by my fears
With my knees on the ground
Everyday feels like it's so predictable
And I can't change it
I just want to break these habits
Take control of this confusion

Write, write in my face
Again and again
All I got fault this is nothing but hate
Write in my face
Feed in my rage
All I got fault is nothing but hate

I'm a ghost in the mist(It's my life)
My life slips away
I wander and see
I don't make any sounds
I'm lost in the mist
And I sure lead the way
Locked in by my fears
With my knees on the ground
I'm a ghost in the mist
My life slips away

Well now get out of my face
Locked here I can not escape
Can't get you out of my face
What have I do now
Locked here I can not escape
What have you done now
We'll not forgive you

I'm a ghost in the mist(It's my life)
My life slips away
I wander and see
I don't make any sounds
I'm lost in the mist
And I sure lead the way
Locked in by my fears
With my knees on the ground
I'm a ghost in the mist
My life slips away

So what have you done now
Locked here I can not escape
What have you done now
We'll not forgive what you say
What have you done now
Locked here I can not escape
What have you done now
We'll not forgive you
