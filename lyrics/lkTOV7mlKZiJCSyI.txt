And now days go by
And I never needed you
And now days go by
And I never needed you

And I worked so hard
And I killed myself
And you broke my bones
And I sold my soul

And now days go by
And I never needed you
And now days go by
And I never needed you

And I could've been your mother
And I could've been your sister
Be your twin brother
I just wanted to be

Wanted to be
And now days go by
And I never needed you
And now days go by

And I never needed you
We were just wasting time
We were just wasting time
We were just wasting time
We were just wasting time
We were just wasting time

We were just wasting time
And now days go by
And I never needed you
And now days go by
And I never needed you
But now days go by
And I never needed you
But now days go by
And I never needed you
ooooo...
