Two flashlights out in the night will get you home
Walking under the night's punctured dome
I know I'm bound to leave this town
There's other there
Although I know we go out, know not where

The sky was wild with circumstance
The ground littered with chance
I'll meet you in the morning
Beyond that, I got no plans

Our fates move like two arrows
Through space and through time
Our lives, they form a black top
With two straight yellow lines
There is no hesitation
None that I can find
When I turn to look over the loan we've left behind

The sky was wild with circumstance
The ground littered with chance
I'll meet you in the morning
Beyond that, I got no plans

I know I'm bound to leave this town
There's other there
Although I know we go out, know not where
