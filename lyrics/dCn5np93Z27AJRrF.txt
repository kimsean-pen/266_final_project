Called to the feast I'll bring the bones
Stay with the skies and I'll go
A lung in the sea a heart in the snow
Who leaves when the carnage is cold?

Under the lights our beating is stoned
Who wages a war in white gold?

Now called to the feast I'll be the bones
Sign of the beast, I hold

Called to the feast I'll bring the bones
Stay with the skies and I'll go
A lung in the sea a heart in the snow
Who leaves when the carnage is cold?

Under the lights our beating is stoned
Who wages a war in white gold?

Now called to the feast I'll be the bones
Sign of the beast, I hold
