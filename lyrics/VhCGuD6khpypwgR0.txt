Ohh...
Can anybody see the light
Where the morn meets the dew
And the tide rises
Did you realise no one can see inside your view?
Did you realise forwhy this sight belongs to you?

Ohh...
Just set aside your fears of life
With the sole desire

Done it warning
Done in now
This ain't real
On in this side

Done it warning
Done in now
This ain't real
On in this side

Done it warning
Done in now
This ain't real

Done it warning
Done in now
This ain't real
On in this side

Ohh...
Oh can anybody see the light
Where the morn meets the dew
And the tide rises
Did you realise no one can see inside your view?
Did you realise, forwhy this sight belongs to you?
