Run to the woods and run for the witches.
Come out from your huts and your houses,
come out from your terrible town.
We'll search for the witches on the outskirts,
if they're different those witches will drown.

come out from your terrible town.
We'll search for the witches on the outskirts,
if they're different those witches will drown.
Hide all your thoughts or your wonderful dreams,
your way of life shouldn't wander too far.
Our little town comes apart at the seams,
so you witches will burn.
