Suddenly I find
I've got darkness on my mind
It's a question mark that keeps me looking
And it's never satisfied
And it's never what I thought
Saying I'm happy when I'm not
No, I got darkness on my mind

Leaning out the frame
When it's particulate and gray
I'm perpendicular to my whole being
When I lean a certain way

Saying I'm happy when I'm not
Finding roaches in the pot
Oh, I got darkness on my mind

Some people spend their whole lives looking
For someone who could understand
While meanwhile a lilac blooming
Sometimes on the driest land
And I know it's been a long time coming
And I'm angry and I know that's weak
And I'm longing out that open window
For whatever it is I seek

Some people spend their whole lives looking
For someone who could understand
And while meanwhile a lilac blooming
Sometimes on the driest land
And I know it's been a long time coming
I'm angry and I know that's weak
So I'm trying not to be so bitter
I'm just looking at it honestly

Well, I know it's been a long time coming
I'm angry and I know that's weak
And I'm longing out that open window
For whatever it is I seek
Some people spend their whole lives looking
For someone who could understand
While meanwhile a lilac blooming
Sometimes on the driest land, yeah
