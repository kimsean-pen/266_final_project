It's your bicycle bells and you Rembrandt swells
Your children alive and still breathing
And your look of loss when you're coming across
Makes me feel like a thief when you're bleeding

Duchess Duchess
Light up your candles for me
Duchess Duchess
Put all your love back in me
I come listening I touch touching

With the Persian sea running through your veins
You shed your names with the seasons
Still they all return with the last remains
And they lay them before you like reasons

With your shimmering dress it says no it says yes
It says I've nothing left for conceiving
Its your shiftless flesh and your old girls grace
Its your young girls face that I'm breathing

Duchess Duchess
Light up your candles for me
Duchess Duchess Duchess
Put all the love back in me

I am lying she is crying
