Pyramid with 1000 steps
Bricks of obsidian glimmering
Carved with ruins
Occult fire burning within

Lens of quartz reflect the night sky
1000 Anchorites in their solitude
Witness new constellations coalesce

Owls perched upon columns of dark energy
The smoke of our offerings draws the night spirits

The moon leads celestial legions
To cast the stars from their ancient thrones
Astral blood pours forth
From their grievous wounds
