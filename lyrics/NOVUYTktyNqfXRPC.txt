Bitch
She appears from the dark as another victim dies
Spirits on the trinity, a shrieking virgin cries
Cryptic writings to raise 'em from the grave
Blasphemy is evident, her soul cannot be saved

Arcane knowledge handed down, unwritten and obscure
The coven prosecuted but no begging for remorse
One by one they're taken as the bell rings its chime
Blasphemy against the church was her only crime

Tie her up Start the fire
Burning in torment alive
For her crimes, for her sins
The bitch will be burned at the stake

Burn (repeat)

Executed for her sins, sentenced by the church
Final rites recited as the fire begins to burn
Cursing all the holy men, the flames are growing higher
No fear in her eyes as the bitch dies by fire
Tie her up
Start the fire
Burning In Torment Alive
For Crimes For Sins
The bitch will be burned at the stake
For Crimes (for crimes) For Sins (For sins)
The Bitch Will Be Burned At The Stake
