Black night
Is not right
I don't feel
So bright
I don't care
To sit tight
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
That I'm free
Free to be me
Black night is a long way from home
I don't need
A dark tree
I don't want
A rough sea
I can't feel,
I can't see.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
That I'm free,
Free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.

Black night,
Black night
I don't need
Black night
I can't see
Dark night.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
That I'm free,
Free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.
