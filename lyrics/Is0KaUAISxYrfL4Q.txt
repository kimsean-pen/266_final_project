En fager kvinne
Ved hallens tunge port står
Lyser som en gudinne
Med blondt langt hår

One day we'll all stand in front of her and get
The judgement given by her scale
The goddess of rights
And the judge of the wrong
This is syn's song

Free us
From the burden we bear
From the forthcoming fear
Incept the trial
It's in your hand
End this nightmare

Med sverdet hevet hun sier
At rett skal være rett
Og skal du få komme gjennom porten
Så må du være bedt

One day we'll all stand in front of her and get
The judgement given by her scale
The goddess of rights
And the judge of the wrong
This is syn's song
