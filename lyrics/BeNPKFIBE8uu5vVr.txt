Giving up, giving up
It's not the way we move
Locking up, locking up
Tonight will be a proof
Scream and shout
Raise the roof
Don't stop until the night will end
Just please never glance back

Don't waste your time
Don't be afraid to loose
Just be yourself
(never regret)
We are the reason of all this mess
Let's bring the pastor
Forever Young

You know the feelings returning
And all fire is burning
I can't leave you here
Just trust me baby
Just trust me baby
Just don't worry

From tonight live life the way you want
From tonight don't be afraid of light
From tonight live life the way you want
From tonight don't be afraid of light

Giving up, giving up
It's not the way we move
Locking up, locking up
Tonight will be a proof
Scream and shout
Raise the roof
Don't stop until the night will end
Just please never glance back

on va danser
on va crier
on va s'aimer
Baby

Everything I do
Everything I say
No matter what
We'll never part

Giving up, giving up
It's not the way we move
Locking up, locking up
Tonight will be a proof
Scream and shout
Raise the roof
Don't stop until the night will end
Just please never glance back

I'll be waiting
(I'll be waiting)
For the moment
(For the moment, for the moment)
I'll be waiting
(wow)
(I'll be waiting)
For the moment
(For this moment, for this moment)
