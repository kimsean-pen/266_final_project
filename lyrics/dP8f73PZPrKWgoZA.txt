If the fire's out baby
How you gonna keep me warm
Supposing you let me
With the door wide open no one can leave

I know it's a lie I want it to be true
The rest of the ride is riding on you
Over goodbyes we'll buy some place for
Wishing you could

Keep me closer
I'm a lazy dancer
When you move I move with you
Wishing you could

Keep me closer
I'm a lazy dancer
When you move I move with you

If somebody's got soul
If somebody's got soul
If somebody's got soul
If somebody's got soul
You gotta make the move
Make the move
Make the move

I know it's a lie I want it to be true
The rest of the ride is riding on you
Over goodbyes we'll buy some place for
Wishing you could

Keep me closer
I'm a lazy dancer
When you move I move with you
Wishing you could

Keep me closer
I'm a lazy dancer
When you move I move with you
Wishing you could

Keep me closer
I'm a lazy dancer
When you move I move with you
Wishing you could

Keep me closer
I'm a lazy dancer
When you move I move with you
