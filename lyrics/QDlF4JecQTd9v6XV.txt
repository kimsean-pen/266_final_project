Walking down Babylon Lane.
Trying to live my life in peace.
Two young men call me not their brother, try to make me feel ashamed.
But I luv I Jah yeah, he tell me not to be that way.
I luv I Jah, yeah, I gotta keep my PMA.
My lovely sister, judge me by my clothes, yeah.
Only to learn to her mistake not everyone's alike.
We're not all a uptight.
Ah no fuss no fight.
Cool that way, cool that way.
I luv I Jah.
