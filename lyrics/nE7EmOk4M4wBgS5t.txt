I was so naive
Fearful of the substantive
Of the greying days
Of carrying endless weight
And what it really meant
To truly mean something
To really be someone who could be loved

So lost in darkness
In and out of selfishness
Hoarding all my dreams
Was just no way to be
Then you gifted me such a precious thing
A chance to be someone who deserved love

When I heard
A single tear
Your cry ring out
A single tear
It showed me what
A single tear
Real strength could be
A single tear

As a single teardrop fell
And was swallowed by the sea
You outshined the best there was
Rewrote who I could be
You outshined the best there was
Rewrote who I could be
When I held you for the first time
I knew I had to survive
When I held you for the first time
I knew I had to survive

As a single teardrop fell
As a single teardrop fell
As a single teardrop fell
As a single teardrop fell

When I heard
A single tear
Your cry ring out
A single tear
It showed me what
A single tear
Real strength could be
A single tear

A single tear
A single tear
A single tear
A single tear
