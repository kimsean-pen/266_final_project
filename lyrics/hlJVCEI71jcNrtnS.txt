Leavin' for the weekend
Got supplies and new strings for my mustang
No surprise if they end up breaking
Got my tele ready if I break them

Looking out the window as I go
Should probably keep my eyes upon the road
Red lights sure makes the drive slow
I get red eyes whenever I'm stoned

Go out and do whatever you wanna (go wild)
Don't just sit there and chirp to the world that you're gonna (go wild)
Theres no pressure to put yourself under (go wild)
Cause if you don't go you're always then gonna wonder
You wonder you wonder

Leads in amp is feeding
Got our Ryder tubes screaming screaming
Kinda fucked up can't tell if I'm dreaming
Suck my puffer cause I'm hardly breathing
Such a sucker when it comes to leaving
Situations that I shouldn't be in

Go out and do whatever you wanna (go wild)
Don't just sit there and chirp to the world that you're gonna (go wild)
There's no pressure to put yourself under (go wild)
Cause if you don't go you're always then gonna wonder
You wonder you wonder

Go out and do whatever you wanna (go wild)
Don't just sit there and chirp to the world that you're gonna (go wild)
Theres no pressure to put yourself under (go wild)
Cause if you don't go you're always then gonna wonder
You wonder you wonder
