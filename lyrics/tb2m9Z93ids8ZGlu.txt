I will break your heart
Baby even if it's not really what I want
I will do you wrong
Baby even if my heart tells me it's bad

I'll flirt with your dad
And I'll sleep with your mum
And then, I'll break your heart
I'll make out with your friends
Oh I will misbehave
One day I'll run away

Cos Jesus made me
But he gave me an evil mind
He gave me an evil heart
He told me to be wild
He told me girl you're mad
Jesus you made me bad

Jesus made me bad
And he gave me a lion for a heart
He gave me a pretty face
And a body to corrupt the man I want

I'll escape to Berlin
And never come back
Baby, I'll take your car
I'll drink all your wine
And steal all your cash
Oh Baby, it's just the way I am
It's just the way I am

Cos Jesus made me
But he gave me an evil mind
He gave me an evil heart
He told me to be wild
He told me girl you're mad
Jesus you made me bad

Cos Jesus made me
But he gave me an evil mind
He gave me an evil heart
He told me to be wild
He told me girl you're mad
Jesus you made me bad
