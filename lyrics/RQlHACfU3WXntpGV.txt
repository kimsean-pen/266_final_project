You gave it all up, you had nothing left
You should have kept some for yourself
It's easier to see in retrospect
What I could have done to help
We only get one life to get it right
We only get one life to lead
Now you can't keep this up night after night
You need to find someone to be

I want to shine a light
On the things you do
I want to shine a light

On the things you do

I never wanted anything from you
I never wanted much at all
But you were always up to something new
You never had that far to fall
(I wanna shine a light)
(I wanna shine a light)
(I wanna shine a light)
(I wanna shine a light)
I want to shine a light
On the things you do
I want to shine a light
On the things you do
I want to shine a light
On the things you do
I want to shine a light
On the things you do
