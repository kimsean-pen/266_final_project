Theres a part of us that knows where night cries
Held in years of yearning after I
Lost the moments only meant for me
Who can tell the heart when it must sleep

I would go to the ends of the earth
if i could hold you
i would search all the lands
if it meant i could hold you

Theres a hope in me that falls each time
Held up by the thought of you and i
Lost in moments only meant for me
No one could tell the heart it had been missing

I would go to the ends of the earth
If i could hold you
I would search all the lands
If it meant i could hold you
