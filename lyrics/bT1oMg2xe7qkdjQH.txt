Sleep seems to evade me,
I just spend the whole night pacing in the hallway
where I used to hear your footsteps on the floor.
I've been so low, and maybe I've been thinking about us lately,
but I guess that doesn't matter anymore.

I just called to say
"I'm sorry, Darling, but I've been wasting my time rotting the teeth out of my head,
Trying hard to swallow the sweetest sentiments I can't express.
And I know that you told me to leave you alone,
but yours is still the only love I've ever known.
