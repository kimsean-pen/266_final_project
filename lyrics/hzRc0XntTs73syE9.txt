I'll never know
Why I had to go
Why I had to put up
Such a lousy, rotten show
Boy, I was tough
Packin' all my stuff
Sayin I don't need you
Anymore I've had enough
And now look at me
Standing here again
'Cause I found out that
Ma ma.
My life is here
Gotta have you near

As good as new
My love for you
And keepin' it that
Way is my intention
As good as new
And growin' too
Yes, I think its
Takin' on a new dimension
It's as good as new
My love for you
Just like it used
To be and even better
As good as new
Thank god, it's true
Darling, we were
Always meant to stay together

Feel like a creep
Never felt so cheap
Never had a notion
That my love could be so deep
How could I make
Such a dumb mistake
Now I know I'm
Not entitled to another break
But please, baby
I beg you to forgive
'Cause I found out that
Ma ma
My life is here
Gotta have you near

As good as new
My love for you
And keepin' it that
Way is my intention
As good as new
And growin' too
Yes, I think it's
Takin' on a new dimension
It's as good as new
My love for you
Just like it used
To be and even better
As good as new
Thank god, it's true
Darling, we were
Always meant to stay together

I thought that our love
Was at an end
But here I am again

As good as new
My love for you
And keepin' it that
Way is my intention
As good as new
And growin' too
Yes, I think it's
Takin' on a new dimension
It's as good as new
My love for you
Just like it used
To be and even better
As good as new
Thank god, it's true
Darling, we were
Always meant to stay together

Yes the love I have for you
Feels as good as new
Darling, we were
Always meant to stay together
