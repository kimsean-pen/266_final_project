Candles burning, the hours turning
A countdown the day that we're born
Don't look backwards, keep driving forwards
The rose withers but not the thorns

If you want it, then you can take it
Just seize it before it's too late
And if all fails, get back on your feet
There's always another today but still we'll

Pray for one last chance to prove we all belong
Through the dark nights and cold days while time marches on

In this life, we're running out of days
We're running out of time, ignoring it's a crime
No regrets, just one shot at glory
Is all we got before we die
Sands of time are slipping through our hands
So try and understand and do it while you can
Don't look back, just one shot at glory
Is all it takes to feel alive

Anger rising, relentless fighting
But soon you'll be finally free
Find your way through this endless maze
Be the one that you wanted to be

Pray for one last chance to prove we all belong
Through the dark nights and cold days while time marches on

In this life, we're running out of days
We're running out of time, ignoring it's a crime
No regrets, just one shot at glory
Is all we got before we die

Sands of time are slipping through our hands
So try and understand and do it while you can
Don't look back, just one shot at glory
Is all it takes to feel alive

Fear not a twisted future, no matter what it brings
Can't you see now, you're all tomorrow's kings
Tomorrow's kings!

Pray for one last chance to prove we all belong
Through the dark nights and cold days while time marches on

In this life, we're running out of days
We're running out of time, ignoring it's a crime
No regrets, just one shot at glory
Is all we got before we die

Sands of time are slipping through our hands
So try and understand and do it while you can
Don't look back, just one shot at glory
Is all it takes to feel alive
