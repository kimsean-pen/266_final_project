Eyes above me
Eyes above
And I just hope the war becomes a whole
I don't want to know
Found me shaking
Out of room
A hundred words
We're never sure
We want to go
Feel it coming
To the steps
Wearing me whole
And bury me in
Never go
It's coming down
Like a shark
Through in the sky
And I don't even know why
If it's in your nature
You never win
If it's in your nature
You never win
