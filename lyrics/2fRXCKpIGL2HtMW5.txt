I wouldn't pretend again, so let's show off instead
Mine isn't a place of hate, so let's turn it around
Don't she makes you don't

Take me from me
Save me from you

I can't comprehend your head, but don't ever think twice
She doesn't believe in friends, but who really knows?

I wouldn't pretend again, so let's show off instead
He wasn't believable, but who really knows?
But who really knows?
But who really knows?

Don't change your mind
Who really knows?
