The rain of toil in heavy weather
This one is gone, this one is better
Why would you stay if it's old?
Why would you stay if it's old?

The devil's here, who is his brother?
They're in this kind of thing together
Why will you stay if it's old?
Why will you stay if it's old?

Run for miles
Back on angry feet
Lost in the start
We can't all meet sleep

Half of your brain
Rattles in my head
Will you sing a song now,
To deal with death?

Want somebody
Hold on
Want somebody
Better hold on til you're gone

Want somebody
Hold on
Want somebody
Better hold on til you're gone

Nevermore will I see you in the morning
Nevermore will I see you in the night

Hope that you don't get me looking at you
The way I shouldn't do.
Why would I stay if it's alright?

Run for miles
Back on angry feet
Lost in the start
We can't all meet sleep

Half of your brain
Rattles in my head
Can you sing a song now,
To deal with death?

Reform, reveling
I say it's your world
Wish in the dark part
Trying to get away before

Want somebody
Hold on
Want somebody
Better hold on til you're gone

Want somebody
And I hold on
Want somebody
Better hold on til you're gone

Want somebody
Hold on
Want somebody
Better hold on til you're gone

Want somebody
Hold on
Want somebody
Better hold on til you're gone
