The waves crash down in the waterpark
They've been left on although everyone's gone
Reflections of emergency lights look so nice
They look so nice

And in a Value Inn I dig at my skin
With a travel kit in the fluorescence
Because I'm lumbering, 'cause I want to be gone
But a point of pride I peel off of the tile
I'm so nice, I am so nice
So nice, I am so nice

And the waves crash down in the waterpark
When the stakes are low there's not much to control
So let it heal with the fibers of my clothes
Until I'm colorful until I'm just so
So nice, I am so nice
So nice, I am so nice
So nice, I am so nice
So nice, I am so nice
