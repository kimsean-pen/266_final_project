You better grab some coffee, your mind's beginning to play tricks on ya

Charlie Manson is alright
It ain't no worse than all the violence of, say Jesus like
At least old Charlie took the blame
For all the violence we committed in his name

I've gone to hell boy
And don't I know it just for thinking that it's
Fucked up, we almost always blame the victim
And we hate you for acting violent to someone else
Oh hell boy, just as long as it sells

Hell boy, I never learned anything else
Hell boy, well someone profits from my hell
Hell boy, I guess I'm doomed to take the blame
Hell boy, for my American brain

Sometimes I feel so powerless
I point my shooter at the sun
And make my trigger finger click
It's clear to everyone I'm sick
But they don't tell the motherfucker poisoning my sink, oh

Hell boy, for shooting children while they play, they hate you
Death fire is paid for by the NRA
They wanna thank you for such a glorious display
My little hell boy, for which my tax dollars I'll pay

Hell boy, I never learned anything else
Hell boy, well someone profits from my hell
Hell boy, I guess I'm doomed to take the blame
Hell boy, for my American brain
Hell boy, for my American brain
Hell boy, for my American brain
Hell boy, my American brain
Help this boy

Hell boy, I never learned anything else
Hell boy, well someone profits from my hell
Hell boy, I guess I'm doomed to take the blame
Hell boy, for my American brain
Hell boy, hell boy, hell boy
