Lonely man
in a lonely town yeah
Key words: overseas factor
Heavy duty
Love you baby
Now I'm ready
I'm ready for the duty
Love is calling upon us to perform
And as I take in your sweet perfume
Love is waiting... love
Overseas factor
Heavy duty
I wonder if we're gonna vibrate close
You know...
I mean...
Will our vibrations, our vibrations, be close?
Like a couple of words...
You know... how they make a rhyme?
Love you baby... love
Love you baby... love
That old blue dress...
It's about wore out
But you look so good and happy
I could just...
I could scream and shout
Love you baby... love
Overseas factor
Heavy duty
Heavy duty
Love... baby

I could feel...
I could feel it...
Feel it...
Love.
