It's a little bit of hiding
That's all it takes
It's a little bit of wondering
If everything was okay

I forgot myself in you, you, you
I forgot myself in you, you, you
I forgot myself in you, you, you
I forgot myself in you, you

This song has a bird in it
Can't you see?
It's right outside my window
But I'm not listening

I forgot myself in you, you, you
I forgot myself in you, you, you
I forgot myself in you, you, you
I forgot myself in you, you
