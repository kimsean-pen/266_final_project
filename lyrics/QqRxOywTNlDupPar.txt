I swim in oceans of blue sky
Autumn hazy
They tell me it's only you
Anticipating the one thing that could save me
But something's not right with the moon
Every time I get by I get closer to thinking
And we don't need that again
I've been sinking in blue eyed Autumn baby
Still thinking back to when

I thought she'd be mine
Thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
Thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning

I walk the streets out of time
So tired and lonely
Never to be the same
It could've been something beautiful if only
I opened my eyes too late
Every time that I try words get lost in the wind
And we don't need that again
I've been thinking of blue eyed Autumn baby
I used to remember when

I thought she'd be mine
Thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
Thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning

I thought she'd be mine
Thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning

Mine in the morning
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning
I thought she'd be mine
Mine in the morning
