There was traffic in Austin
when you gave yourself up
to the crushing release of a car.

Long live the devil and all hail the saints
chewing up stars with their names.
Angel, i feel your pain
I understand why you'd want to take it all away.

I still think about the body,
by the gas station where you lied.
A bloodstained body of what once was,
just another meal for the flies.
