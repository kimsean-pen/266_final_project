(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

You told me.
I see you rise,
But it always falls.
I see you come,
I see you go.
You say, 'All things pass into the night.'

And I say, 'Oh no sir!
I must say "You're wrong!"
I must disagree!'
I say, 'Oh no sir!
I must say "You're wrong!
Won't you listen to me?"'

You told me.
I've seen it all before,
I've been there.
I've seen my hopes and dreams
Lying on the ground,
I've seen the sky
Just begin to fall.
You say, 'All things pass into the night.'

And I say, 'Oh no sir!
I must say "You're wrong!"
I must disagree!'
I say, 'Oh no sir!
I must say "You're wrong!
Won't you listen to me?"'

Goodbye Horses!
I'm flying over you.
Goodbye Horses!
I'm flying over you.
Goodbye Horses!
I'm flying over you.
I'm flying, flying, flying over you.

Goodbye Horses!
I'm flying over you.
Goodbye Horses!
I'm flying over you.
Goodbye Horses!
I'm flying over you.
I'm flying, flying, flying over you.
