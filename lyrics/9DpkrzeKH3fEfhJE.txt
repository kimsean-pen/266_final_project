You say you're not ready
For a long time thing
It's got too hot and heavy
Not like I want a ring
You're such an over-thinker
You've given yourself the spooks
But why'd you have to fight it
When you know it's something good?

Used to joke about my age
But now who's acting young?
So many things I want to say
On the tip of my tongue
But not gonna waste my breath
I'll just let you do you
But stupid to ignore it
When you know it's something

So go run a mile
'Cause you're scared of my smile
You say that it's self preservation
'Cause you can't fall in love
It's all just too much
You're starting to really kind of fully test on my patience

Silly, silly, silly, silly boy
What you playing for?
Not convinced that I'm your favorite toy
Make me insecure
Time is on my side
I know you'll miss me in a week
Then my silly, silly boy
Will come back begging at my feet

You say it's upsetting
That it has to end
You're open to ideas
But we can't just be friends
You're such an silly boy, huh
You'd rather quit then knock on wood
But why'd you have to throw it
When you know it's something good

So go run a mile
'Cause you're scared of my smile
You say that it's self preservation
'Cause you can't fall in love
It's all just too much
You're tarting to really kind of fully test on my patience

Silly, silly, silly, silly boy
What you playing for?
Not convinced that I'm your favorite toy
Make me insecure
But time is on my side
I know you'll miss me in a week
Then my silly silly boy
Will come back begging at my feet

Silly, silly, silly, silly

You're pulling up a wall
For the sake of it, sake of it, mmm
Cutting something short cause you're
Scared of it, scared of it, it

Silly, silly, silly, silly
Silly, silly boy
Silly, silly, silly, silly boy
What you playing for?
Not convinced that I'm your favorite toy
Make me insecure
But time is on my side
I know you'll miss me in a week
Then my silly, silly boy
Will come back begging at my feet

Silly, silly, silly, silly
Silly, silly, silly, silly
That sexy, sexy babe
