They all stay,
But I don't know which way to go,
And i've been hanging all the things that I used to know,
And that's why it's coming through,
I forget I was here with you, now that's all I can do, is dream of you

I keep finding? in everybody's eyes,
I keep losing people and act surprised, And I don't wanna be like? on the telephone,
I don't wanna wake up dreaming it's a year ago,
I don't wanna go,
Oh I just wanna be with you.
