You're nothing but a dirty, dirty old man
You do your thinking with a one track mind
Keep talkin' about heaven glory
But on your face is a different story

Clean up your rap your story's getting dusty
Wash out your mouth, your lies are getting rusty
Can't believe nothing you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do

You know, you're funkier than a mosquito's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of bollweevils
Same old game, same old thing you never changed
Always rappin' 'bout the same old thing

I got something to tell ya, I got something to tell you baby
But you ain't hip to baby, blowin' minds is a thing of the past
You blew your chance that's why you never last
You want to be a graduated mother, but in reality just another brother

You think you slick but could stand a lot of greasing
The things you do ain't never really pleasin'
Can't believe nothin' you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do

You know you funkier than a mosquito's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of bollweevils
Same old game, same old thing
Always rappin' 'bout the same old thing

Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful

You put yourself upon a big stool
Nothin' worse than an educated fool
Talkin' sex is your favorite conversation
But peace and love is a famous generation

What's in your head has really started showing
Your conversation gettin' kinda boring
Can't believe nothin' you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do

You know you are funkier than a mosquito's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of bollweevils
Same old game, same old game
Same old thing you never change
Same old game, same old thing
Always rappin' 'bout the same old thing
