Now, let me tell you a story
The Devil, he has a plan
Bag of bones in his pocket
Get anything you want
No dust, no rocks
The whole thing is over
All those beauties in solid motion
All those beauties
They're gonna swallow you up

Let's go
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi, hi

One time too many
Too far to go
Hi, we've come to take you home, whoo-oo

When they split those atoms
It's hotter than the Sun
Blood is a special substance
They gonna pray for that man
So wake up, young lovers
The whole thing is over
Watch out, touch monkeys
All that blood
They're gonna swallow you whole

Let's go
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi, hi

What's that? who's driving?
Where we going? who knows?
Hi, we've come to take you home, whoo-oo

How many people do you think I am?
Pretend I am somebody else
You can pretend I'm a old millionare
A millionare washin' his hands
Rattle the bones of dreams that stick out
A medical chart on the wall
Soft violins, hands touch your throat
Everyone wants to explode

Now, when your hands get dirty
Nobody knows you at all
Don't have a window to slip out of
Lights on, nobody home
Click-click, see ya later
Beta-beta, and no time to rest
Picka-picka, risky business
All that blood will never cover that mess

Let's go
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi, hi

So soft, hard feeling
No tricks, let's go
Hi, we've come to take you home, whoo-oo
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi, hi
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi, hi
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi
