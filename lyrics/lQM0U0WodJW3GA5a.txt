What's my purpose huh?
What's my future? I don't know
These are the questions I address
Before I go to sleep
I wish my mind would turn off
With the lights on my TV screen,
But here in the dark, everything off
I start to think
It gets hard to breathe

I, I, I, I,
I'm in over my
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my
I'm in over my head
All these thoughts
Are an ocean I'm drowning in
I'm in over my
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my
I'm in over my head

Second guessing I'm so stressed
Success is an empty lie
So what's the point
If that's our purpose on Earth by design?
All this stressin' got me confessing
That I can't find peace
While I hydrate, caffeinate, medicate, repeat
I hydrate, caffeinate, medicate, repeat, I

I, I, I, I,
I'm in over my
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my
I'm in over my head
All these thoughts
Are an ocean I'm drowning in
I'm in over my
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my
I'm in over my head

And It's all out of my control
It's all out of my control
It's all out of my control
And it's all out of my control
And it's all out of my control
And it's all out of my control

I'm in over my head
I'm in over my
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my
I'm in over my head
