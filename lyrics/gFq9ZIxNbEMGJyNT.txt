I won't wait for
I won't wait for
I won't wait for permission
I won't wait for
I won't wait for
I won't wait for permission

Never thought I would be outside
Don't know why you're gone
Slip and fall, it's not the first time
First the feather, now the swan
Why am I not one for this life
Unequivocally flawed
Cried alone, it's not the last time

I won't wait for
I won't wait for
I won't wait for
