Strangers lit the fire
Strangers came
In and out all the same

And I saw them coming
Saw the way
Danger came around
With their heavy gait

I am a stranger now
I am a stranger now
I am a stranger now
Playing in the dark

You stood silhouetted as sky changed
Through the roots that I now retrace

Strangers lit the fire
Strangers came
In and out
All the same

I am alone now
I am alone now
I am alone now
Playing in the dark
