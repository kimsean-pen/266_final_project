Don't wanna be awake
(I don't wanna sleep)
Will you pacify me?
Lights out, we'll see what lies beneath

Nocturnal highs
When you wanna lay down and play dead
Concise uneasy eyes
You choose when you see it and when you don't

I wanna shed my skin
I wanna see who I really am
I wanna swim with all that drags me in every time

Don't wanna be awake
(I don't wanna sleep)
Will you pacify me?
Lights out, we'll see what lies beneath

Who are all these people in the back of my mind?
(I wanna run away)
They shout when I sleep and when I close my eyes they're all I can see
Who are all these people in the back of my mind?
(I wanna run away)
Distance, if you don't keep it
Wait till the light's out, then you'll see me

These words don't rectify our plight
Are you satisfied this time?
If we're still in harm's way
Do not resuscitate me

I wanna shed my skin
I wanna see who I really am
I wanna swim with all that drags me in every time
I wanna escape, I can't take the great divide
I've seen all I need to see
If only we can take a leap of faith to beyond the surface
We'll see what lies beneath

Who are all these people in the back of my mind?
(I wanna run away)
They shout when I sleep and when I close my eyes they're all I can see
Who are all these people in the back of my mind?
(I wanna run away)
They shout when i sleep and when I close my eyes they're all I can see
Who are all these people in the back of my mind?
(I wanna run away)
Distance, if you don't keep it
Wait till the light's out, then you'll see me

I'm the face in the river, reflection in the mirror that made you turn
I'm the creature at the end of the bed
I'm a projection of the thoughts in your head
(I don't wanna be awake)
I'm the million different effigies trapped under your skin that make you burn
(I don't wanna be awake)
I'll be the beat in your pulse when I'm beatin' you to a pulp, one day you'll learn
(I don't wanna be awake)
I'm the voice of the people, the speaker of evil
Cemetery of sound, but tonight this is my battleground

Tonight this is my battleground
Bang your fucking head
