It's buggin' me
Gratin' me
And twistin' me around
Yeah I'm endlessly
Cavin' in
And turning inside out

'Cause I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
And I'm breakin' out
I'm breakin' out
Last chance to lose control

Yeah, it's holdin' me
Morphin' me
And forcin' me to strive
To be endlessly
Cold within
And dreaming I'm alive

'Cause I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
I'm not breakin' down
I'm breakin' out
Last chance to lose control

And I want you now
I want you now
I'll feel my heart implode
And I'm breakin' out
Escaping now
Feelin' my faith erode
