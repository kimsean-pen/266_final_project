Love, thy will be done
I can no longer hide
I can no longer run
No longer can I resist the guiding light
It gives me the power to keep up the fight
Love, thy will be done
Since I have found you my life has just begun
And I see all of your creations as one
Perfect complex
No one less beautiful
Or more special than the next
We are all blessed and so wise to accept
Thy will love be done
Love, thy will be mine
And make me strive for the glorious and divine
I could not be more, more satisfied
(Satisfied)
Even when there's no peace outside my window
There's peace inside
And that's why I no longer run
(I don't know)
Love, thy will be done

Love thy will be done
I can no longer hide
I can no longer run
(No)
Love, thy will be done
Thy will love be done
No longer can I resist
(No)
The guiding light
(Guiding light)
The light that gives me the power to keep up the fight
I couldn't be more satisfied
(No)
Even when there's no peace outside my window
There's peace inside
And that's why I can not longer run
Love thy will be done
(Thy will be done, done, done)
Love, thy will be done
I can no longer hide
I can no longer run
Love, thy will be done
Thy will love be done
Love, thy will be done
I can no longer hide
I can no longer run
(No, no, no)
Love, thy will be done
Thy will love be done
Thy will love be done
Thy will love be done
