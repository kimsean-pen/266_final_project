"Remember not the sins
Offenses of my youth
According to thy mercy think upon me
Oh lord for thy goodness
Blessed are they that mourn
For they shall be comforted
Our father which art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done"

Grief and failure
Burn in my veins
Vice and regret, coursing through me
Breathe in defeat, feel it aching
Cold black heartbreak, lungs collapsing

Dear departed, violent hands
Faith forgotten, no redemption
Heart rate fallen, coffin timber
Committed to earth, by the hands of your father

Glory be, bloodline buried
I am no one, I am nothing

Glory be, bloodline buried
I am no one, I am nothing

Forgive me my father, for I am a sinner
Unanswered, abandoned

Glory be, bloodline buried
I am no one, I am nothing

Unanswered, abandoned
