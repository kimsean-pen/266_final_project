You won't see me die here!

You always say I need to get as far away as I can
While I've got time to play with and any risk, I'll take it

Or fade away in this suburban wasteland
And watch all your plans
Sink right under your feet
Sink right under your feet

Watch all your plans
Sink right under your feet!

Under your feet is the ground to break!
You only get what you take!
So don't just sit and watch the atrophy of it!

I have stood back for way too long!
You are broken, you are so broken!

I can see that we may be running out of time
The curtain's falling in slow motion!
I can feel that the sense has left your mind
The curtain's falling in slow motion!

Why did you go?
I can't watch
So quiet and peaceful
Where did I go wrong?
Say you can stay, I can't look away

You won't see me die here!
You won't see me die here!

Now! Now! Do you hear me now?
Screaming at the top of my lungs all night
Now! Now! Do you hear me now?
Screaming at the top of my lungs all night
Why? Why? Ask me why?
Go ahead and act like you don't know why
Why? Why? Ask me why?
I'll scream it, you blow me away

You blow me away!
You blow me away!

Can you give me my breathe back?
Can you give me my breathe back?
Can you give me my breathe back?
Can you give me my breathe back?

Do you hear me now?
Screaming at the top of my lungs all night
Do you hear me now?
Screaming at the top of my lungs all night (do you hear me now?)

Do you hear me now?
