The daughter's father watches, quietly we assume
He's no longer with us but he left this dusty room
In your name and it's an honor, it's a shame but it's your honor
Take it on your shoulder 'til you can find another

That's enough for now, he should've never left you broken
He should've held you, things your father never could do
That's enough for now, he would've never left you broken
He would've held you, things your father never told you

The century before you never could turn 21
Years and years he waited just watching for a son
For someone to go ahead, take the name he said
Years and years he waited and a daughter came instead

But that's enough for now, he should've never left you broken
He should've held you, things your father never could do
That's enough for now, he would've never left you broken
He would've held you, things your father never told you

Breathing comes in pairs
Except for twice
One begins and one's goodbye

Sixty years of sorrow he got five or six of bliss
Left my mother's mother without so much as a kiss, as a kiss.

But that's enough for now, he never wanted to leave you broken
He would've held you, things your father never told you
That's enough for now, I would've never left you broken
I would've held you, things your father never could do
Words your father never told you
Sixty years of sorrow, he got five or six of bliss
Left my mother's mother without so much as a kiss
