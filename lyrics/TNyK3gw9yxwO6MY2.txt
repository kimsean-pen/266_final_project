Game over, game
The game is over
Game over, game
You lose

Game over, game
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
You lose

Invincible, is what you think you are
But you're just so typical
Though you think that you're a star
You act like everyone revolves around you
Baby, you dropped the ball
And now the game is through

'Cause you tried to play both sides
(both sides)
You got caught up in your lies
(In your lies)
But you're running, you're running out of time

You played yourself (Game over, game)
But did you did you think that you would really find love
from someone else (Game over, game)
You're making moves, you're gonna lose, you know
You played yourself (Game over, game)
And now you're thinkin', thinkin' you can get one by me
But you'll never win, but you'll never win
Try again, 'cause the game is over

The game is over

Take it personal 'cause I did when you cheated on me
You may be beautiful
But there's more that the eye can't see
You're so predictable
The way you calculate each move
Heads I win, tails you lose because you don't have the right to choose

'Cause you tried to play both sides
(Both sides)
You got caught up in your lies
(In your lies)
And now you're running, you're running out of time (yeah)

You played yourself (Game over, game)
But did you did you think that you would really find love
from someone else (Game over, game)
You're making moves, you're gonna lose, you know
You played yourself (Game over, game)
And now you're thinkin', thinkin' you can get one by me
But you'll never win, but you'll never win
Try again, 'cause the game is over (yeah)

Uh
Whoo!

How could you think that you could do me like that?
Running behind my back
How could you do me like that? (do me like that)
Now the game is over (oh)
How could you think you could do me like that?
Do me like that?
Do me like that?
Uh!

Played yourself (Game over, game) (oh)
But did you did you think that you would really find love
from someone else (Game over, game) (?)
You're making moves, you're gonna lose, you know
You played yourself (Game over, game) (played yourself)
And now you're thinkin', thinkin' you can get one by me
(thought you could get one by me)
But you'll never win, but you'll never win
Try again, 'cause the game is over (oh)

You played yourself (uh huh)(game over game)
But did you did you think that you would really find love
from someone else (Game over, game) (you could find love)
You're making moves, you're gonna lose,(oh oh oh)
You know you played yourself (Game over, game) (you played yourself)
And now you're thinkin', thinkin' you can get one by me (get one by me)
But you'll never win, but you'll never win
Try again, 'cause the game is over

Game Over
