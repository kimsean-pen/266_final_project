It was dawn and I
Waited on the filter
So to typify
Said she called me mister
Under misty skies
Hit to get there quicker
Rebel through the night
'Cuz I truly missed her
Universal charm
'Cuz she thinks it's humour
And I mean no harm
Lie down into this
Fall back she says
Let's just keep this mutual

It's these lines I dread
Too much life force simple

As the night awaits
I can see her sleeping
Stare down mistake
Does she know my secret?

I'm in love with her
Let the love manifest
Watch me take my serve

Watch me take control
She doesn't know what hit her
Glimpses of her soul
As a seamless dinner
Numbers on the plate
It's my turn now
One minute to the hour
