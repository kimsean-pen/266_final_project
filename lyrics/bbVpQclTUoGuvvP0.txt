You look through
The hair on your face
The way that you say
The things that you do
I've been through
All of the games
All of the ways
That you've been fooled

I know I've seen your face
In different times and places

Come, get a little closer
I wanna get to know ya
We ain't keepin' no secrets
There'll be no sheets between us tonight
Talk to me, let's go deeper
You already know I need ya
We ain't keepin' no secrets
I wanna see ya leave on the lights

Talk to me, talk to me, yeah, oh
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me

Say your piece
The words that come out
Out of your mouth
I wanna hear
We can't be
Something divine
Planets align
Where we should be

I know I've seen your face
In different times and places

Come, get a little closer
I wanna get to know ya
We ain't keepin' no secrets
There'll be no sheets between us tonight
Talk to me, let's go deeper
You already know I need ya
We ain't keepin' no secrets
I wanna see ya leave on the lights
Talk to me, talk to me

Baby in my head
We can love forever
Here in my bed
Where we'll lay together

Come, get a little closer
I wanna get to know ya
We ain't keepin' no secrets
There'll be no sheets between us tonight
Talk to me, let's go deeper
You already know I need ya
We ain't keepin' no secrets
I wanna see ya leave on the lights

Talk to me, talk to me, yeah, oh
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me
