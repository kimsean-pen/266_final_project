I got your number, in many ways
You like the drama, so what you saying now?
This game we're playing now, where we pretend that we're good?
You're not forgiven for what you did
But out in public, we're in the same clique
Think I can work with this, I got you understood

Just know your role and we'll be fake friends
Just know your role and we'll be fake friends

I know the story that no one's seen
But I'm not innocent, so let's not come clean
Let's play respectfully
We ain't got nothing to say
And I still stand by the things I said
You may trick others, but you're not in my head
This rivalry ain't dead, unless we're up on a stage

Just know your role and we'll be fake friends
Just know your role and we'll be fake friends
Just know your role and we'll be fake friends
Just know your role and we'll be fake friends

You don't trust me and you've got no reason to (to, to, to)
I've got a panic button I don't wanna press on you
You don't trust me and I don't trust you (don't trust you, trust you)
You've got a panic button, lets just coexist
No one has to know that we're on each others lists

Know your role and we'll be fake friends
Just know your role and we'll be fake friends
Just know your role and we'll be fake friends
(You don't trust me and you've got no reason to)
Just know your role and we'll be fake friends
(You don't trust me and I don't trust you)
