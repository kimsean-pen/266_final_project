My sisters and I
Have one wish before we die
And it may sound strange
As if our minds are deranged

Please don't ask us why
Beneath the sheltering sky
We have this strange obsession
You have the means in your possession

Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you

The young man agreed
He would satisfy the need
So they danced for his pleasure
With a joy you could not measure

They wait for him here
The same place every year
And in the sheltering sky
Across the desert he would fly

Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you

Ohhh
Sky turned to black
Would he ever come back
They would climb a high dune

They would pray to the moon
But he never return
So the sisters would burn
As their eyes search the land
With their cups still full of sand
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
Tea in the Sahara with you
