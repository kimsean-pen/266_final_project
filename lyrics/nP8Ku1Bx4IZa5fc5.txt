With your hair in braids
Your mother tips the maid
Blind-folded nun
You make the shot-gun spray
(Make you or break you!)
Who you gonna run to now
(Make you or break you!)
Who you gonna run to now

You think you're classic today
You must be basic baby
You think you're classic today
I better check on you
(Make you or break you!)
Who you gonna run to now
(Make you or break you!)
Who you gonna run to now

I gotta crush on
I gotta crush you
Baby please
I gotta crush on
I gotta crush you now

And what goes around
You know it comes around
And if it comes around
You know the kids are down
(Make you or break you!)
Who you gonna run to now
(Make you or break you!)
Who you gonna run to now

With your hair pulled tight
You're so essential tonight
You always crush and come
You make the shotgun spray
(Make you or break you!)
Who you gonna run to now
(Make you or break you!)
Who you gonna run to now

I gotta crush on
I gotta crush you
Baby please
I gotta crush on
I gotta crush you now

And what goes around
You know it comes around
And if it comes around
You know the kids are down
(Make you or break you!)
Who you gonna run to now
(Make you or break you!)
Who you gonna run to now

You think you're classic today
You must be basic baby
You think you're classic today
I better check on you
(Make you or break you!)
Who you gonna run to now
(Make you or break you!)
Who you gonna run to now

I gotta crush on
I gotta crush you
Baby please
I gotta crush on
I gotta crush you now

You love it!
You love it!
Baby please
You love it!
You love it!
Baby please
You love it!
You love it!
Baby please
You love it!
You love it!
Baby please

I gotta crush on
I gotta crush you
Baby please
I gotta crush on
I gotta crush you now

And what goes around
You know it comes around
And what goes around
You know it comes around
And what goes around
You know it comes around
And what goes around
You know it comes around
