Standing on a beach somewhere
Looking for something to see
As the beach rolls in, I swear
It's bringing something to me

Baby, one day I'll have what I want:
Someone to stand next to me
But until then, I'll just wait and watch
As the pull rolls into me

Beach foam baby
Midnight baby
Beach foam, beach foam baby
Midnight baby, midnight baby
Midnight

Standing on a shore somewhere
Looking for something to be
As the beach rolls in, I swear
It's bringing something to me

Baby, one day I'll have what I want
Baby, one day I'll follow the stream
But until then I'll just wait and watch
As the pull rolls into me

Beach foam baby
Midnight baby
Beach foam, beach foam baby
Midnight baby, midnight baby
Midnight

Beach foam baby, beach foam
Beach foam baby
Midnight baby, midnight baby
Midnight
