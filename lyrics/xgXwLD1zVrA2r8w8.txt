Long drive home through the rain
Can't help from feeling like things will never be the same again
It's nobodies fault that I feel this way
There's nothing you can do but watch me decay

And all the things you say to me
I can't remember them all
But please don't think that it's
because your problems don't matter to me
When you're alone and scared I will be there to listen to you
I'm trying the hardest that I can
