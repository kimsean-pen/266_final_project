I bought your love, but you're giving me the shortchange
Yeah, I want a heavy head and pockets so drained
Oh, couldn't you spend a little more for me
Cause I don't wanna work for free
With nothing in return (nothing in return)
Use me up when I couldn't tie above ya
Pull my sleeve when I'm giving you the cold shoulder
Because I'm always stuck between
Out that door and at your feet
Oh will I ever learn? (will I ever learn?)

So you can paint me any way you like
I can be the villain if it helps you sleep at night
Because you left me with a bruise
And I'm over being used
When I get to someone new
I'm not gonna be broke from you

You were so quick to find all my weakness
All my wrongs, like I needed your forgiveness
But you know that I gave all I had
And then some after that
You bled me dry, cast me aside
Said an eye for an eye

So you can paint me any way you like
I can be the villain if it helps you sleep at night
Because you left me with a bruise
And I'm over being used
When I get to someone new
I'm not gonna be broke from you

You're giving me the shortchange
I'm cashing in, I'm walking out
Cause you know better than to keep me here and knock me out
You're giving me the shortchange
And you got scared, I get it
But you didn't say you loved me when it mattered
You're giving me the shortchange
I'm cashing in, I'm walking out
Cause you know better than to keep me here and knock me out
You're giving me the shortchange
And you got scared, I get it
But you didn't say you loved me when it mattered
You're giving me the shortchange
You're giving me the shortchange
You're giving me the shortchange
You're giving me the shortchange
You're giving me the shortchange
