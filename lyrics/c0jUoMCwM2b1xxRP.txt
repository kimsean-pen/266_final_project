I can't win
I can't reign
I will never win this game
Without you
Without you
I am lost

I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you
Without you
I won't run

I won't fly

I will never make it by
Without you
Without you

I can't rest
I can't fight

All I need is you and I
Without you
without you

Oh oh oh!
You! You! You!
Without...
You! You! You!
Without... you
Can't erase

So I'll take blame
But I can't accept that
We're estranged
Without you
Without you

I can't quit now
This can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night
Without you
Without you
I won't soar
I won't climb
If you're not here
I'm paralyzed
Without you
Without you
I can't look
I'm so blind
I lose my heart
I lose my mind
Without you
Without you
Oh oh oh!
You! You! You!
Without...
You! You! You!
Without... you
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you
Without you
Without... you
