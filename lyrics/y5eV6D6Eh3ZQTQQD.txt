Why does it feel like I'm living through you?
Tell me why I'm addicted to you?
'Cause I don't even know
Chasing this 'cause we think we want it
But we can't breathe 'cause the air is toxic
So tell me where to go
It's a thin, thin line
To admit or deny, yeah, yeah
How's this a different kind of love?
It used to be saving us,
Now it's just breaking us
It's not about just giving up
We knowing we're not safe enough

Get away, get away, get away
Get away, get away, get away-y-y
Get away, get away, get away

Do I stay 'cause you say you need me?
I craved it more when it isn't easy
How am I supposed to grow?
It won't fix 'cause I say I love you
I need to show but I don't know how to
How am I supposed to grow?

It's a thin, thin line
To admit or deny, yeah, yeah
How's this a different kind of love?
It used to be saving us,
Now it's just breaking us
It's not about just giving up
We knowing that safe enough

Get away, get away, get away
Get away, get away, get away-y-y
Get away, get away, get away

Yeah, yeah
Get away
Yeah, yeah

How's this a different kind of love?
It used to be saving us,
Now it's just breaking us
It's not about just giving up
We knowing we're not safe, safe
How's this a different kind of love?
It used to be saving us,
Now it's just breaking us
It's not about just giving up
We knowing we're not safe enough

Get away, get away, get away
Get away
