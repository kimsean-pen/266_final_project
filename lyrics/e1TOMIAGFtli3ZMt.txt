Human, behold your kingdom
See how you shaped a world
That was never meant to be yours

Greedy little claws
And bloodshot eyes
You can not grasp the answers
That you're so determined to find

What we have done can not be erased
Corruption spreads in all directions
All we have now is the fear of change
The inability to see
What we have made of this world
Don't you smell it in the air?
Can't you taste it in the water?

Lost within a city of steel
No one can leave
No one is free
Why are you afraid of what you might find
When you take a look beneath your skin?

What we have done can not be erased
Corruption spreads in all directions
All we have now is the fear of change
The inability to see
What we have made of this world
Don't you smell it in the air?
Can't you taste it in the water?

I can't fix this
I can't escape this
Haunt me, haunt me
I can't fix this
I can't escape this
Haunt me
Haunt me!
