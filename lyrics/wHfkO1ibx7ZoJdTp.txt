Fill up the sky, fill up the land
Thousands playbacks repeat again
Trick on the past, clock on the wall
Counts no time lag happened to me

It's just like unknown cipher from a plotter
Squeezed tight and fallen apart
I pick up your endless tape to find a lead
I rewind it back again

I call and chase – the misplaced friend in the missing link
To recall the shape – thrown out somewhere in the link

I kill off the slags and fill up my brain
Fifty footprints follow me
Stuck into rain, prick in my hand shows me
Next trap shining black

Where to find that peaceful factor?
Like a flower, just dead and faded out
I pick up your ending tape to make a wish
I turn it back again

I call to save – the misplaced friend in the missing link
To recall the shape – thrown out in the compressed chain

I see just a bit of seeds
I swear, just a bit of greed
I hope, just a bit of sleep
I doubt, it's all in my sweet nightmares
I found some face not mine

Fill up the sky, fill up the land
Thousands playbacks repeat again
Kill off the slags, fill up my brain
Fifty footprints follow me
Where to find the fatal coil
For my cipher, for my shelter
Won't you let me out, let me be sure
That you find me out in the missing link

I call and chase – the misplaced friend in the missing link
To recall the shape – thrown out in the compressed chain

I see just a bit of seeds
I swear, just a bit of greed
I hope, just a bit of sleep
I doubt, it's all in my sweet nightmares
I heard some voice, that's mine
