Did you believe in us?
Did you believe you believe in trust?
Cause Ive been thinking it over
And youre aware that I want you
When were alone in the dark
And I could take you right now
Youre the way that I want you
Moving for me
Did you believe in us?
Did you believe you believe in trust?
Cause Ive been thinking it over
And youre aware that I want you
When were alone in the dark
And I could take you right now
Youre the way that I want you
Moving for me
You say believe in
Trust in us
You say believe in
Remember us
Did I push it too much?
Does it feel like were rushing?
Cause weve been getting closer
And Im aware that you want me
Dont want to give this up
You know that this could be something
We could dance in the echoes, echoes
You say believe in
Trust in us
You say believe in
Remember us
You say believe in
Trust in us
You say believe in
Remember us
You say believe in
Trust in us
You say believe in
Remember us
