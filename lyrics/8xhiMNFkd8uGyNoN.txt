If I was to tell you just how much I need you
Would you come tonight?
Or would you not believe me 'cause a love that easy
Never turns out right?

I'm trying to change the rules
You deserve something good in your life
We've waited for far too long
So come get your blessing tonight, baby

Won't you come over love so I can show you love?
Promise I got enough to give you all that you need, baby
So many search to find love that's as good as mine
I will not waste your time so bring it all to me, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, bring it all to me, ooh, ooh, ooh

Baby, let me teach you, give you love instruction
Show you what I know
We should take it easy, ain't no need to rush, no
Baby, nice and slow

All this love I can give to you
I expect just a bit in return
You don't have to be perfect, love
As long as you're willing to learn, baby

Won't you come over love so I can show you love?
Promise I got enough to give you all that you need, baby
So many search to find love that's as good as mine
I will not waste your time so bring it all to me, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, bring it all to me, ooh, ooh, ooh

Turn down the lights
Give you all of my love tonight
Let's do what lovers do
Oh, I'm ready for you

Don't wanna to waste my time
So don't make me beg tonight
And don't keep me waiting for love
Won't you come over love?

Won't you come over love so I can show you love?
Promise I got enough to give you all that you need, baby
So many search to find love that's as good as mine
I will not waste your time so bring it all to me, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, bring it all to me, ooh, ooh, ooh

Oh, you know I love
Said I love, yes I love, I love
Bring it all to me 'cause I love
I want, I want, baby

I love, I love
Bring it all to me 'cause I love
I want, I want, baby, baby
