Hey Light
In the curtain, in the room, in a well-made bed for two, I'm walking.

Hey Light
I'd forgotten work today, cause you should work all day, they're walking

Hey Light, the colors will arise, keep it deep inside, we are also working

Hey Light
I can wear my moccasins
you have made me smile again. There aint nothin' like you.
