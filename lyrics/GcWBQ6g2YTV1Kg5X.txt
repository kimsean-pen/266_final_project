Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love everywhere

Give a little love to me
Take a little love from me
I want to share it with you
I feel like a millionaire

Once we were mad, we were happy
We spent all our days holding hands together
Do you remember, my love
How we danced and played
In the rain, we laid
Could stay there
Forever and ever

Now, I am sad, you are so far away
I sit counting the hours day by day
Come back to me
How I long for your love
Come back to me
Be happy like we used to be

(Come back, come back to me)
(Come back, come back to me)

Come back to me, oh, my love
How I long for your love
Won't you come back to me?

My fine friend
Take me with you
And love me forever
My fine friend
Forever ever

Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love everywhere

Give a little love to me
Take a little love from me
I want to share it with you
Come back, come back to me
Make me feel, make me feel
Like a millionaire
