Kevin wants to hear a pop song
Wants to dance with the girls
From the restroom
Kevin wants to move sideways,
Wants to move backwards
Kevin wants to move
Kevin wants to stand beside me,
choose the next record,
Put on a 70's tune
Kevin wants to talk to everyone
Talk to everyone that
He knows in the room

Hoo, hoo
I wanna be unamerican (hoo, hoo)
I wanna write you a love song (hoo, hoo)
I wanna be unamerican (hoo, hoo)
And I wanna get all the words wrong (hoo, hoo)

Hoo, hoo
I wanna be unamerican (hoo, hoo)
I wanna write you a love song (hoo, hoo)
I wanna be unamerican (hoo, hoo)
And I wanna get all the words wrong (hoo, hoo)

Kevin wants to hear a sad song
Wants to stay home on Friday, Saturday
Kevin wants to move to London,
Wants to see Paris, Kevin wants to move
Kevin wants to stand alone at a subway
station, watch all the trains go through
Kevin wants to skip the next song,
skip the next song,
And skip the next song too

Hoo, hoo
I wanna be unamerican (hoo, hoo)
I wanna write you a love song (hoo, hoo)
I wanna be unamerican (hoo, hoo)
And I wanna get all the words wrong (hoo, hoo)

Kevin wants to hear a
Talk show wants to
keep up with the girls
From the restroom
Now he wants to move
Slowly wants
to move with you, Kevin wants to move
Now wants to stand beside
You choose to say "I do", put on a 70s tune
Kevin wants to dance
With everyone,
dance with everyone
That he loves in the room

Hoo, hoo
I wanna be unamerican (hoo, hoo)
I wanna write you a love song (hoo, hoo)
I wanna be unamerican (hoo, hoo)
And I wanna get all the words wrong (hoo, hoo)
