Each Time
I'm away
On a plain
Gone for days

You'll find
Someone else
Come along
Take my place

I try
Every night
To call you up
Down the line

Alright
Never mind
I'm all alone
Doin' fine

Because you're
[gone gone gone gone away...]

Because you're
[gone gone gone gone away...]

And love is
[gone gone gone gone away...]

[gone gone gone gone]
And love is
[gone gone gone gone]

That's right
Shed a tear
Say goodnight
Dry your eyes

This time
It's all so clear
Don't look back
No goodbyes

We start
Moving on
Sliding in
Where we belong

I'm still
Feeling like
You're leaving me
Hanging on

Because you're
[gone gone gone gone away...]

Because you're
[gone gone gone gone away...]

And love is
[gone gone gone gone away...]

[gone gone gone gone]
And love is
[gone gone gone gone]
