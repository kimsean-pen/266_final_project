Everytime We Touch (Yanous Candlelight Mix)

I still hear your voice,
When you sleep next to me.
I still feel your touch,
in my dreams.
Forgive me my weakness,
But I dont know why,
Without you it's hard to survive
'Cause every time we touch,
I get this feeling
And every time we kiss,
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast,
I want this to last,
Need you by my side
'Cause every time we touch,
I feel the static,
And every time we kiss,
I reach for the sky,
Can't you hear my heart beat so
I can't let you go,
I Want you in my life.

Your arms are my castle,
Your heart is my sky.
They wipe away all of the tears that I've cried
The good and the bad times,
We've been through them all.
You make me rise when I fall.
'Cause every time we touch,
I get this feeling

And every time we kiss,
I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast,
I want this to last,
Need you by my side
'Cause every time we touch,
I feel the static,
And every time we kiss,
I reach for the sky,
Can't you feel my heart beat slow,
I can't let you go,
I Want you in my life.

'every time we touch,

'Cause every time we touch,
I feel the static,
And every time we kiss,
I reach for the sky,
Can't you feel my heart beat slow,
I can't let you go,
I Want you in my life.
