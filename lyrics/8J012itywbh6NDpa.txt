Watching the flames
Fill up the sky
When the world is on fire
We need to remember
Who we are

We're losing grip bit by bit
Is it worth fighting for it?
Losing time day by day
Are you gonna leave or stay?

If the choices we make
Define who we are
Then this is who I am
I'll never let go
When our worlds collide
When our worlds collide
I will never let go
When our worlds collide

Just like a supernova exploding
Out two worlds are colliding
We are endlessly falling
Just like a photograph aging, fading
The cracks are slowly breaking
And we are slowly changing

I'm watching the flames
Painting the sky
The world is on fire

We're losing grip bit by bit
Is it worth fighting for it?
Oh, fading away piece by piece
Struggling hard to breathe

If the choices we make
Define who we are
Then this is who I am
I'll never let go
When our worlds collide
When our worlds collide

When our worlds collide
When our worlds collide
When our worlds collide
When our worlds collide

Just like a supernova exploding
Our two worlds are colliding
We are endlessly falling
Just like a photograph aging, fading
The cracks are slowly breaking
And we are slowly changing

If the choices we make
Define who we are (who we are)
Then this is who I am
I'll never let go
When our worlds collide
When our worlds collide

When our worlds collide
When our worlds collide
When our worlds collide
When our worlds collide
