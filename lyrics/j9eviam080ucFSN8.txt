You know
You know
You know just what you're doing
Admit it
Oh, why [?] years to talk?
You know

She'll think she know it all alone
She'll lie, she's a liar
Who didn't want to face your front
But doesn't need to be some price
[?] don't comprise
For anyone
The only speaking words
A [?] someone
Who doesn't know

Did you come undone?
Did you wake up someone I know?

Now I know I'm not alone
God, my girls, I'm not alone
Now I know I'm not alone
God, my girls, I'm not alone
Love you for days, I'm not alone
You're the place that I belong
God, my girls, I'm not alone
Not alone

You know
You know
You know just what you're doing
Admit it
Oh, why [?] years to talk?
You know

She'll think she know it all alone
She'll lie, she's a liar
Who didn't want to face your front
But doesn't need to be some price
[?] don't compromise
Love (love)
For anyone

Now I know I'm not alone
God, my girls, I'm not alone
Now I know I'm not alone
God, my girls, I'm not alone
Love you for days, I'm not alone
You're the place that I belong
God, my girls, I'm not alone
Not alone
