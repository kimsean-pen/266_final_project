It's gotten cold in here
But asylum warmth draws near
And with a gentle touch of these burdens
And such fears are wiped clear
Who says you ought to stay?
How's this the easier way?
It's far from giving up
Cowards never say enough is enough

And then I'm lifted up
Out of the cribs and towel
The bath begins to drain
And from the floor he prays away
All my pain

Who says that God exists?
We can't see icons or myths, but
Well, I believe in you
Do you believe in me, too?
Get me out

All the things you can't control
Should never destroy the love one holds
I found a place
I found a place
I found a place where we belong

Never be up and down, be in between the whitest clouds
Never did I ever think I'd buy up all the things I've found
'Cause how you keep on living when you're always but a million down
All I've ever wanted was to be happy and make you proud
