Blame it all on Drake
He's the one who got us thinking
Love was something fake
Just another double timing
Double tap that page
But I can't relate
Cause I know you'd never do that
You put me in the highest place
Even though you can't afford to fly a private plane
Drive you to the wild when
We're making big mistakes
But we don't hit the brakes
Confident we're getting through it

Everyone's saying that it's just too good to believe
Calling me foolish for falling in your gravity
I got a word for that and the word is jealousy
Wishing they were you and me

So fuck it if they don't like us
Cause I think we're fucking righteous
We're out of our minds, we're mindless
But we don't mind it
We're just gonna do what nobody do

So fuck it if they don't like us
Cause I think we're fucking righteous
We're out of our minds, we're mindless
But we don't mind it
Just telling the truth, ain't nobody do it like us

Haters gonna hate
Only staying fed by scraping someone else's plate
Serving up the tea instead of making lemonade
Hiding in the shade
Ignore it all we're so used to it

Everyone's saying that it's just too good to believe
Calling me foolish for falling in your gravity
I got a word for that and the word is jealousy
Wishing they were you and me

So fuck it if they don't like us
Cause I think we're fucking righteous
We're out of our minds, we're mindless
But we don't mind it
We're just gonna do what nobody do
So fuck it if they don't like us
Cause I think we're fucking righteous
We're out of our minds, we're mindless
But we don't mind it
Just telling the truth, ain't nobody do it like us

Nobody do it like us
Nobody, nobody
Nobody do it like us
Nobody, nobody

So fuck it if they don't like us
Cause I think we're fucking righteous
We're out of our minds, we're mindless
But we don't mind it
We're just gonna do what nobody do
So fuck it if they don't like us
Cause I think we're fucking righteous
We're out of our minds, we're mindless
But we don't mind it
Just telling the truth, ain't nobody do it like us
