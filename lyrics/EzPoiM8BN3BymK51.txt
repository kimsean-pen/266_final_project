I can't remember why I'm feeling this way
I guess I should be crying but my heart just won't obey
It feels strange to be happy as I lie here on the rooftop in the rain
I say

Amen
To all the crazy things that happened that made me who I am
I say amen
To everyone who ever hurt me
I'm stronger 'cause of them
Amen

I'm not worrying 'bout tomorrow
I'm forgetting yesterday
Just savouring the moment in this unfamiliar place
And I'm feeling like the velvet in a beat-up guitar case
And so, I'll say

I say amen
To all the crazy things that happened that made me who I am
I say amen
To everyone who ever hurt me
I'm stronger 'cause of them
Amen

Oh, life is so bizzare
Why do we have to be so hard on ourselves?
I think I found a way to smile and be OK with myself
With myself

Amen
To all the crazy things that happened that made me who I am
Amen
To everyone who ever hurt me
I'm stronger 'cause of them
And I might have not the answers, but the questions make more sense
Amen
