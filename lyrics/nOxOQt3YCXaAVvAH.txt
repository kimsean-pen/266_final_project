Who's that tryin' to talk to me
Standin' over there lookin' like a wannabe
Keep me on ice, subzero degrees
I'm so solid that you can't see through me

We rock the stage like a playoff game
Don't have to say it, you know my name
Three-point shot, no time on the clock
And the crowd goes wild, are you ready or not?!

And the crowd goes
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
And the crowd goes
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
And the crowd goes
I'm a superstar and I got a cool car
And the girls like me better than whoever you are
Cuz I make your day
Lemme hear you say
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

Ha! Come on, let's bring it back to them
Now listen in, uh!

Your busted up club, it was doomed from the start
Don't even try it, we're state of the art
When we break the rules, they bend for us
When they need the job done, they send for us

Brand new kicks and a brand new jersey
What do you expect, yeah we deserve it
Three-point shot, no time on the clock
And the crowd goes wild, are you ready or not?!

And the crowd goes
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
And the crowd goes
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
And the crowd goes
I'm a superstar and I got a cool car
And the girls like me better than whoever you are
Cuz I make your day
Lemme hear you say
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

You can't do something like that
It's the crush!
Here we go, here we go!

And the crowd goes
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
And the crowd goes
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
And the crowd goes
I'm a superstar and I got a cool car
And the girls like me better than whoever you are
Cuz I make your day
Lemme hear you say
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
And the crowd goes
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
And the crowd goes
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
And the crowd goes
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
