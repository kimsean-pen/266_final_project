Waves of gray keep rolling in
Come what may we'll keep on rising
When the world comes crashing in
Come what may we'll keep surviving

Come what may
We'll keep surviving
Come what may
We'll keep surviving
We'll keep surviving

Like the clouds that ride the wind
Come what may we'll keep on flying
Scars of glory on our skin
Come what may we'll keep on fighting

Come what may
We'll keep surviving
Come what may
We'll keep surviving
We'll keep surviving

Waves of gray keep rolling in
Come what may we'll keep surviving
