My hands shake cause today,
I know you're gonna break my heart and,
My life without you in it
Is a life not worth living
I'll be strong but I wish I was someone else,
Anyone but me tonight

Here I stand (Here I stand)
On my own, (Here I stand)
Tonight (Here I stand)
And I wish I was strong enough to breathe (Here I stand)
Without you, (Here I stand)
In my life, (Here I stand)
I wish I was anyone but me

So I'll start to pretend I'm ok
But you should know by now that
My life is smoke and mirrors,
The one thing is crystal clear
That I'm the one wishing i was someone else,
Anyone but me tonight

Here I stand (Here I stand)
On my own, (Here I stand)
Tonight (Here I stand)
And I wish I was strong enough to breathe (Here I stand)
Without you, (Here I stand)
In my life, (Here I stand)
I wish I was anyone but me

(Where do we go?) (Where do we go?)

Inside I start to fall apart. (Where do we go?)
And I'm pretend I'm holding on (Where do we go?)
So i guess I'll bleed in silence(In silence)
I guess I'll bleed in silence

Here I stand (Here I stand)
On my own, (Here I stand)
Tonight (Here I stand)
And I wish I was strong enough to breathe (Here I stand)
Without you, (Here I stand)
In my life, (Here I stand)
I wish I was anyone but me

Here I stand (Here I stand)
On my own, (Here I stand)
Tonight (Here I stand)
And I wish I was strong enough to breathe (Here I stand)
Without you, (Here I stand)
In my life, (Here I stand)
I wish I was anyone but me
