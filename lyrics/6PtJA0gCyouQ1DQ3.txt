Now I don't know when and it's hard to explain
But it seems like things are just kind of insane
Because the world is crying, but nobody is listening
So please leave a message on my cell phone

I see bullets getting better, biblical weather
And the guy on TV is like a total asshole
Who are you wearing tonight?
Celebrity fundraiser tight
Black ties making wrongs right
How's your social band-aid?

I don't know much, I don't know too much
But I know this: shit is fucked up!

(Nah nah nah...)
I guess it's all about the dream
(Nah nah nah...)
The ends justify the means
(Nah nah nah...)
I'm telling you, shit is fucked up
(Nah nah nah...)
You know it's all about the dream
(Nah nah nah...)
The ends justify the means
(Nah nah nah...)

Now thank God for the media
For saving the day
Putting it all into perspective in a responsible way
With more celebrity news
Typical bullshit and views
I think we're losing this fight
Sponsored by Bud Light
And now we're rocking the casbah
And taking the flag
The genie's out of the bottle
And we can't put it back (put it back!)
All this stuff
It's overwhelming my brain
Can't you see the storm coming
It's coming this way

I don't know much, I don't know too much
But I know this: shit is fucked up!

(Nah nah nah...)
I guess it's all about the dream
(Nah nah nah...)
The ends justify the means
(Nah nah nah...)
I'm telling you, shit is fucked up
(Nah nah nah...)
You know it's all about the dream
(Nah nah nah...)
The ends justify the means
(Nah nah nah...)
They justify the means!

Shopping Sprees, RPG's, ecstasy, atrophy
Genocide, Pimp my ride, politize, euphemize
Injustice everywhere, apathy, I don't care
Hurricanes, climate change, Huh!

Therapy, I won't tell, rehab and LOL
Worldwide calamity, TV Reality
Euthanize, supersize, death squads and boob jobs
VIP infamy, Gratify instantly

I don't know much, I don't know too much
I don't know much, I don't know too much

(Nah nah nah...)
I guess it's all about the dream
(Nah nah nah...)
The ends justify the means
(Nah nah nah...)
I'm telling you, shit is fucked up

(Nah nah nah...)
You know it's all about the dream
(Nah nah nah...)
The ends justify the means
(Nah nah nah...)
The means!
The means!
