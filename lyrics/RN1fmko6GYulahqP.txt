Tell me that I look like I'm gone
When I'm around
I know there's nothing wrong with my heart
Then you still start
Say I make the same old sounds
When you're around
But I say that when you go away
It's all just the same

Why you gotta treat me this way?
You know I wouldn't want it to stay
I don't wanna drift away today
Well, alright

The world's a pretty unfair place
Well, that's what they say
The world's a pretty unfair place
Well, that's what they say
The world's a pretty unfair place
Well, that's what they say

I tried to find the answers in myself
I tried to find the reasons in my head
I don't wanna drift away today
The tiny parts we miss will go away
Well, alright
