I feel hazy
Why is everything black and white?
I feel dizzy
Like my fucking head is full of dynamite
Jump in my Mercedes
But it isn't quite driving right

I don't get it, I'm not drunk
A million people in the place and there you are
And I was like

Hi my name is
Whatever you call me
So let's get undressed
Cause you look a little lonely
I'll make you scream, I'll make you laugh
Cover your body with my autograph
So let's get undressed
Cause I wanna see you naked

I hear nothing
Except this beat, that never ends
Some girl talking
Sounds like fucking white noise in my head
Everything's bending
You're the only focus in my lens

I don't get it, I'm not drunk
A million people in the place but you're the one
That gets me like

Hi my name is
Whatever you call me
So let's get undressed
Cause you look a little lonely
I'll make you scream, I'll make you laugh
Cover your body with my autograph
So let's get undressed
Cause I wanna see you naked

It was just another Friday night
Then I saw you it was stupid I got stupefied
Now I got you here
I'm unwrapping you slowly
Another button and some more of you is showing
And it all started with
Hi my name is, whatever you call me

Hi my name is
Whatever you call me
So let's get undressed
Cause you look a little lonely
I'll make you scream, I'll make you laugh
Cover your body with my autograph
So let's get undressed
Cause you're driving me crazy yeah
So let's get undressed
Hey
Cause I wanna see you naked
