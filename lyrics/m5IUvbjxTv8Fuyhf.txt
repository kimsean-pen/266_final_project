Bound for glory, made for you
Voice of summer told me to

Lay your head underneath my wing

I got the sun in the sky, waiting on revival
Hole in my chest, ready to be filled
Without your love, I'm all out
Ready to be lonesome

I just lay my head underneath your wing

Laying down your guns
Let it all out, take more in the chin for me
Hold down your breath
Sink down low, take more in the tempo
Let yourself be free

Lay your head underneath my wing

I got a hole in my chest ready for an answer
Praying on relief
Sun in the sky, ready for revival today
Left myself all in
Swallow your breath, ready to sink down low
Lay yourself on me
The hole in the sky is ready for revival today
Waiting on to be

And lay my head underneath your wing
Just lay your head underneath my wing
