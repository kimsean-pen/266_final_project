He's on the wall
The god that you love
The curtain's halfway drawn
Who's out there?
The lighter on the bed
The petrol in your hand
The fire at your door
Still hungry

What's your favourite game to play
Lying on your back all day?

We can't run
Step outside and watch it burn
Stupid thing
Open wide and let them in

The flannel on the floor
The purple round your mouth
You watched it till it's old
And shining
I watched you from the bed
Putting on your face
A child in a mask
A child

What's your favourite game to play
Lying on your back all day?
