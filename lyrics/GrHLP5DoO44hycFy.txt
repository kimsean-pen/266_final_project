Why can't we be together?
Can't you love me, don't hate me
I don't see why can't we live together
Baby we can get it on
Maybe we can get along
Assure me, oh destiny
And if you wanna rise up
We got a cold streak living inside us
We can make this hate stop (It's all the same, all the shame)
Now, don't you wanna rise up?
We've been giving hate (hoohoo) a chance
We got all this love to give, you know
And the love will be running out for us
Can't you feel that there's a life?
That hope that we can still survive
As the wind carries every different way
So why do we see these colours?
It's only skin deep, don't mean a thing
So clear, I don't need this with or others
Can't you see it's killing us?
Can't you see it's killing us?
Can't you see it's killing me?
Trigger happy fantasies
So stand up and be so strong now
We can make this hate stop
Now, don't you wanna rise up?
We've been giving hate a chance
We got all this love to give you know
And the love will be running out for us
Can't you feel that there's a life?
That hope that we can still survive
As the wind carries every different way

The wind carries every different way
The wind carries every different way
Every different way!

Now you've been taking
Our dignity for too long
I want to save this certainty that we hold
And who's right?
And who is wrong?
We're not so different anyway
Words are in this song
Can't we stop the fighting? 'cause
We've been giving hate a chance (Don't give hate a chance)
We got all this love to give, you know
We have all this love to give (And
the love will be running out for us)
I feel the love is gonna run out for us
Can't you feel that there's a life?
That hope that we can still survive
As the wind carries every different way
Don't give this hate a chance (The wind carries every dove away)
We got all this love to give, you know
And this tree of life will still
survive (The wind carries every dove away)
Until no more people have to cry
I say, don't give this hate a chance
(As the wind carries every dove away!)
We got all this love to give,
you know (As the wind carries every dove away!)
