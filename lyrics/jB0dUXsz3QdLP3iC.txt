What have I done. Tell me where did I go wrong.
Is it time to say goodbye and justify the truth I know.
Promise I'm fine, sure it won't show.
State of minds, they spiral out of control.

My mistakes are mine to own now. I'm to blame.
I will bury my excuses. What a shame.
They've been my escape and I've gotta break these habits now.
I've been so vacant, trying to escape these hollow sounds.

This hurt me bad. She hurt me more.
I could play this game for days, but in the end I'm still not whole.
Solemnly swear, so out of hand.
Yeah it seems like, I've forgotten who I am.

My mistakes are mine to own now. I'm to blame.
I will bury my excuses. What a shame.
They've been my escape and I've gotta break these habits now.
I've been so vacant, trying to escape these hollow sounds.

This is a cry for help I don't show.
No empathy for what you don't know.

I'm done with this, can't run from it anymore.
Wipe it all away, and cut the fray that weakens the rope.

They've been my escape and I've gotta break these habits now.
I've been so vacant, trying to escape these hollow sounds.

My mistakes are mine to own now. I'm to blame.
I will bury my excuses. What a shame.
They've been my escape and I've gotta break these habits now.
I've been so vacant, trying to escape these hollow sounds.

These hollow sounds.
These hollow sounds.
