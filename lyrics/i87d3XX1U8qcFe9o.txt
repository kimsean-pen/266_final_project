you came along when i
needed a saviour
someone to pull me
through somehow
i've been torn apart so
many times
i've been hurt so many
times before
so i'm counting on you now

somebody already
broke my heart
somebody already
broke my heart

here i am
so don't leave me stranded
on the end of a line
hanging on the edge of a lie
i've been torn apart so
many times
i've been hurt so many
times before
so be careful and be kind

somebody already
broke my heart
if someone has to lose
i don't want to play
somebody already
broke my heart
no no i can't go there again
