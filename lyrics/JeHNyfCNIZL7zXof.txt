Always back in town
Always at your down
Always marking days
Off the calender
Always my last night
Always saying goodbye
Always hear your roar
Always see your stripes
Always passing through
Always hanging my hat
Always on my mind
Always "Feed my cat?"
And I'm always packing my bags
I'm always back in town
According to you

Always back in town
Always making amends
Always staying clean
Always on again
Always gone for good
Always "How it's been?"
Always find my room
Just as I left it
Always won't be long
Always never call
Always leaving soon
Always back for more
And I'm always packing my bags
I'm always back in town
