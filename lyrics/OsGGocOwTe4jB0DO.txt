Burning lights
Hang over head
Body high
Swimming in my bed
We ignite
We're slipping lakes and
Don't you know you excite me like that
When you touch me like that
Got me running right back
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it now
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna show you how
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Higher heights
To shallow breaths
Hold it tight
Never, never end
Pull me down
To ecstasy
Don't you know you excite me like that
When you touch me like that
Got me running right back
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it now
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna show you how
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
