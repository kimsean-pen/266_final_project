Cold night
Dark December
Half 9
When death takes over youLife ain't
as perfect back as when we were kids
I'm reminiscing 'bout the days forgotten 'fore all of this
It's taking me back to the moment you picked up the phone
You lying there bleeding
I'm writing at home
I dropped the guitar
Hitting the road
Chasing sirens beck & call

Racing through the night
To get to you alive
Checking every patient
Every hospital
I'm running through the lights
Driving on the right
Tryn'a find out if you'll make it all

Clinging onto life
Choppers in the sky
Shutting out the light like I'm fighting off the Afterlife
Clinging onto life
Pulling out the knife
Twenty years gone and I'm fighting off the Afterlife

It's only getting harder looking after your peers
When you're becoming unfamiliar with their current affairs
They're taking a switchblade to the ribcage arguing over theft
They left you bleeding on the pavement six
holes in your chestRacing through the night
To get to you alive
Checking every patient
Every hospital
I'm running through the lights
Driving on the right
Tryn'a find out if you'll make it allClinging onto life
Choppers in the sky
Shutting out the light like I'm fighting off the Afterlife
Clinging onto life
Pulling out the knife
Twenty years gone and I'm fighting off the
AfterlifeNot the one bleeding while the sirens call
Not the one bleeding while the sirens callNot the one bleeding while
the sirens callI'm out here pleading that you'll make it at allNot
the one bleeding while the sirens callI'm out here
pleading that you'll make it at all Clinging onto life
Choppers in the sky
Shutting out the light like I'm fighting off the Afterlife
Clinging onto life
Pulling out the knife
Twenty years gone and I'm fighting off the Afterlife
