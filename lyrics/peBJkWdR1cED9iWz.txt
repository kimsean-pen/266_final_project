Tell me why you'd want my love when I give you none?
Both your eyes are on my heart after all I've done
But I did what I did and it's alright
To tell me that you think it's not right

But you woke the lion, oh
The lion, oh
You woke the lion, oh
You wanted fire, oh
Now I'm alight, oh
You woke the lion, oh

Told you twice you'd change your mind
Once you knew what it's like
Held your pride like all those times
I let go of mine
But I did what I did and its alright
If you play the victim one more time

But you woke the lion, oh
The lion, oh
You woke the lion, oh
You wanted fire, oh
Now I'm alight, oh
You woke the lion, oh

So here we are, I'm in your arms
One more time
Say what you will, another kill
With those eyes

But you woke the lion, oh
The lion, oh
You woke the lion, oh
You wanted fire, oh
Now I'm alight, oh
You woke the lion, oh
