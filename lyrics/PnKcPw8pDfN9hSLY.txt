If you bottle every first impression
And sent them out to sea
But forgot mine, it would still find a way to me
'Cause the viewpoint never changes
When they're stuck inside a memory
Another night, another wasted echo

Can I?
Can I rewrite my code?
Retain the good and purge the bad

Take, take, oh please, just take it back
I don't want your double helix
Take, take, oh please, just take it back
I don't want your double helix
Take, take, oh please, just take it back
I don't want your double helix
Take, take, oh please, just take it back
I don't want your double helix

But you're still apart of me
Clever and calculated
Or at least I'd like to be
Swallowed up in hatred while the surgery replaces who you are
Another time, another face to let go

Can I?
Can I rewrite my code?
Retain the good and purge the bad
You're fraying at the fabric
I'm pulling at the strands

Take, take, oh please, just take it back
I don't want your double helix
Take, take, oh please, just take it back
I don't want your double helix
Take, take, oh please, just take it back
I don't want your double helix
Take, take, oh please, just take it back
I don't want your
I don't want your

I never learned
Of all the places that you hide
Surrender, all your words will fall
I never learned
Of all the places that you hide
I never learned
The only fear is what's inside

Take, take, oh please, just take it back
I don't want your double helix
Take, take, oh please, just take it back
I don't want your double helix
Take, take, oh please, just take it back
I don't want your double helix
Take, take, oh please, just take it back
I don't want your
I don't want your
