I haven't played a show in way too long
People keep asking me where I have gone
I started fading quick, yeah
When I should've been making it, oh

I guess that I lost my sight, I was way too young
Doubting what's in my mind
Guess I'll never learn
Still trying to figure it out, yeah
It's all that I'm thinking about, ooh

I'm gonna take it for what it's worth
Put in the hours 'til I have learned it
Show everybody what I deserve, oh
Yeah

Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire

Everyone in this game, we lie too much
Say we're doing it for the love, only for the love
But I'm not ashamed to say, yeah
That I wanna be rich someday

'Cause never had it when I was a kid
Mom and dad working double shifts
Kinda hard on relationships, oh

But I'm gonna show them just what they're worth
I'm gonna put in the work, yeah

Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build a castle in my head
A kingdom from my bed
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build a castle in my head
A kingdom from my bed, oh

Making the sacrifices I gotta make
Missing out on the times, wish I could've stayed
Breaking my heart into pieces when I go away
Watching it fade

Gonna build an empire
Gonna build an empire
Yeah

Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build a castle in my head
A kingdom from my bed
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build an empire, empire
Gonna build a castle in my head
A kingdom from my bed, oh
