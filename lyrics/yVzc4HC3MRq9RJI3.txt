In a deep breath
And it all starts to change
Flip my world inside out

Honestly I like it better this way
When I mesh the night
Through the back of my eyes

I have put myself here
I'm the culprit
I am the culprit

I've been swallowed up alive
Shut down building from the inside out
I can finally walk through the walls
Walk through the walls

I've been swallowed up alive
Shut down building from the inside out
I can finally walk through the walls
Walk through the walls

I swear I've slipped
Right through the cracks in the floor

It's so easy when it's pulling me under
It's so easy when it's pulling me under
It's so easy when it's pulling me under

Now I can see things from the outside
And I will sit here with no place in mind

I swear I've slipped
Right through the cracks in the floor
I swear I've slipped
Right through the cracks in the floor

I can't escape from this place
I can't escape from, this is so unfamiliar
This is so unfamiliar to me, to me
To me, to me

I can hear the unsatisfying silence
My mouth is open
But none of you can hear me
