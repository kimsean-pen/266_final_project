Randomized life on outlying planets
On tour in the void with friends who can manage
Offers trickle in through in through the bandwidth
You play to weird markets, play wherever you can

I may live it a long while
Vagrant life and all its mirth
Seek domesticity in exile
On occasion dream of earth

I may live it a long while
On occasion dream of earth
Dream of earth... (dream of earth, dream of earth, dream of...)

Get offworld, get extrasolar
Boot the motor, we've got time to waste
(In every blot of space)
Our goodwill is gonna kill us
But come what may we're on our way
(Intrepid and unphased)
Get offworld, get extrasolar
Boot the motor, we've gotta lotta time to waste
(And a hundred friends to blame)
Our goodwill is gonna kill us
But come what may we're on our way

Meet attendance and meet new men
Gaily browse a thousand vendors
Riff on dinner and coordinates
And it all just blurs again
Only sometimes have my focus
But reserve a general well-being
Think of all the junk I jettison and what it does for me
Think of all the junk I jettison and what it does for me
All the junk I jettison...
(and all the junk I jettison, and all the...)

Get offworld, get extrasolar
Boot the motor, we've got time to waste
(In every blot of space)
Our goodwill is gonna kill us
But come what may we're on our way
(Intrepid and unphased)
Get offworld, get extrasolar
Boot the motor, we've gotta lotta time to waste
(And a hundred friends to blame)
Our goodwill is gonna kill us
But come what may we're on our way

Supernova solar flare
Just burst bright and died somewhere
Its glint from lakebed mica strike
And warm an earthling mind
Type of work and type of life
Browse monitors all night
Some cosmic bard with means to roam
Will his loneliness deny

Get offworld, get extrasolar
Boot the motor, we've got time to waste
(In every blot of space)
Our goodwill is gonna kill us
But come what may we're on our way
(Intrepid and unphased)
Get offworld, get extrasolar
Boot the motor, we've gotta lotta time to waste
(And a hundred friends to blame)
Our goodwill is gonna kill us
But come what may we're on our way
