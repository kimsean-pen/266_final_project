I did my best to recognize
What's good and bad
What's sad and right
But they will never do the same
They'll never let you go anyway
The dirty laughs, the jealous pats
They'll never go away

I did my best to read your eyes
To read between your pretty lies
But now I'm such a wreck, you see
For me it's already the end of time
Time

Papercut you gave me
Just a papercut you left me
Papercut you gave me
Just a papercut you left me

Papercut
Cut
Papercut
Cut

I did my best to read your eyes
To read between your pretty lies
But now I'm such a wreck, you see
For me it's already the end of time

Papercut you gave me
Just a papercut you left me
Papercut you gave me
Just a papercut you left me

Papercut
Cut
Papercut
Cut
Papercut
Cut
Papercut
Cut

All this time you gave me
Nothing left to keep
But it's time to let you go
To see you in your dreams
