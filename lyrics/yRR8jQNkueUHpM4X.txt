Everybody's talking at me
I don't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of my mind

People stop and stare
I don't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Banking off of the north-east wind
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

(Wah wah, wah wah, wah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Wah)

I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Banking off of the north-east wind
Sailing on a summer breeze
Skipping over the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talking at me
I don't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of my mind

I won't let you leave our love behind
No, I won't let you leave
Our love behind
