I told you once about a place
That I had accidentally
Stumbled upon
Can you imagine how it feels
To find somewhere
That you can do no wrong
But it's alright
You're safe in my hands

I'll meet you in the sky tonight
And we will trace
Some undiscovered stars
We'll go beyond the universe
Beyond all understanding
Hey, it's not that far
But it's alright
I feel safe in your hands

I can't stand living this way
Getting by from day to day
I'm drinking from your loving cup
I told you things were looking up
Oh oh oh so good
Oh it feels so good

We're all the same but then again
We're all quite different
In our own peculiar ways
We've come so far
And now we're going
Through another phase
But it's alright
We made it so far

I can't stand living this way
Getting by from day to day
I'm drinking from your loving cup
I told you things were looking up

As we all know it's hard to breathe
When something spiritual
Has taken place
We don't know how we don't know why
We've been transformed
Into a state of grace
But it's alright
We walk in our sleep
Yes it's alright
This is rapture of the deep
