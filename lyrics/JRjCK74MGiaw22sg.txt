I saw
You dance
From the corner
I cought
Your name
In a conversation
Playing hard-to-get
But I can't understand

When I look at you
I see the story in your eyes
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine

The night begins to shine
The night begins to shine
The night begins to shine
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine

Talk 'till dawn
My heart was racing
I took you home
In the driving rain
Had my mind made up
I wanna feel your touch

When I look at you
I see the story in your eyes
When we' re dancing
The night begins to shine

The night begins to shine
The night begins to shine
The night begins to shine
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine

The night begins to shine (the night begins to shine)
The night begins to shine

Had my mind made up
I wanna feel your touch

When I look at you
I see the story in your eyes
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine

Night begins to shine
The night begins to shine
Night begins to shine
The night begins to shinr
Night begins to shine
The night begins to shine
Night begins to shine
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine

Night begins to shine
The night begins to shine
(Night begins to shine)
Night begins to shine
The night begins to shine
(The night begins to shine)
