I buckle and rosed
As god and the rest(wrist)
How mere riches be
A war or we lose
Close into symbols
A fly drinks the ignitions(indications)
They turn infant's breath my
Milk and wrap to her baby
In day
And night to come

I buckle and rosed
As god and the rest(wrist)
How mere riches be
A war or we lose
Close into symbols
A fly drinks the ignitions(indications)
They turn infant's breath my
Milk and wrap to her baby
In day
And night to come

Their little hands
Smooth all things
Ad nauseum

Singed by it, pulled around of my blazening
(Pulled round)
Eyes on the usually science of cherry-colored
(Trousers)
Limelight not the music it's plain as as can be so
(Tighter)
All of the time I improvise by making sure
(Tighter)
It's to wait for you
Rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder

Singed by it, pulled around of my blazening
(Pulled round)
Eyes on the usually science of cherry-colored
(Trousers)
Limelight not the music it's plain as as can be so
(Tighter)
All of the time I improvise by making sure
(Tighter)
It's to wait for you
Rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder

Pulled round
Trousers
Tighter
Tighter

Their fan I tickle
From serpents to dragons
I'd immerse you in flame
Your milk and your passion
Lead weight for his from his old turn
The young, I was eagerest
I'm losing the stars
I enlisted to find you
I buckle and rosed
As god and the rest(wrist)
How mere riches be
A war all we lose
Close into symbols
A fly drinks the ignitions
They turn infant's breath my
Milk and wrap to her baby

In day
And night to come
Their little hands
Smooth all things
Ad nauseum

Things old
And young
Very young
Rise here comes our reason
of the stars I enlisted to find you

Singed by it, pulled around of my blazening
(Pulled round)
Eyes on the usually science of cherry-coloursed
(Trousers)
Limelight not the music, it's plain as as can be so
(Tighter)
All of the time I improvise by making sure
(Tighter)
It's to wait for you
Pulled round of
Pulled round of
Pulled round of
Pulled round of

Singed by it, pulled around of my blazening
(Pulled round)
Eyes on the usually science of cherry-coloursed
(Trousers)
Limelight not the music, it's plain as as can be so
(Tighter)
All of the time I improvise by making sure
(Tighter)
It's to wait for you
Pulled round of
Pulled round of
Pulled round of
Pulled round of
