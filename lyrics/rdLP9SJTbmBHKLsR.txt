if you pull too hard
then the string will break
and if you leave the slack
then the string wont hold

so how can we find ourselves
trapped in our own private hells
where we just scream but no one can hear
x marks the spot where the dig begins
the treasure is found within
the broken hearts that are soaked with fear

fill the glass to the brim
and it will spill out
keep on sharpening the knife
and it will be so blunt

so how can we find ourselves
trapped in our own private hells
where we just scream but no one can hear
x marks the spot where the dig begins
the treasure is found within
the broken hearts that are soaked with fear

to be at one with all your, your life

so how can we find ourselves
trapped in our own private hells
where we just scream but no one can hear

so how can we find ourselves
trapped in our own private hells
where we just scream but no one can hear
x marks the spot where the dig begins
the treasure is found within
the broken hearts that are soaked with fear

to be at one with all your life
and do without doing a thing
don't try too hard to understand
or you'll miss the missing point at hand
