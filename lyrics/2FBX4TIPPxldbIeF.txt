I've said it once and I'll say it again
I've got something hanging over my head
I was laying on your shoulder
Perfectly content
Until you told me all over again

I ain't got no sob story to write
But just like everyone else I'm living this life an
Don't need to win me over
And there ain't no other side
To shelter me from all the wrong where I decide

But you say we don't mess around
You've got no freedom to come down
We don't take angels from the sky
Oh no
But we don't mess around
You're meant to be among the clouds
Cause you're an angel
But that's a lie
Oh oh oh

Well I suppose you think that I'm so flattered to hear
That I'm a whispered conscience in your ear, yeah
And that's exactly the reason that I never fit in here
Well nothings ever that black and white my dear
No

But you say we don't mess around
You've got no freedom to come down
We don't take angels from the sky
Oh no
We don't mess around
You're meant to be among the clouds
Cause you're an angel
But that's a lie
Oh oh oh

I'm not your angel darling
I'm not your angel darling
I am never gonna be

I'm not your angel darling
I'm not your angel darling
I am never gonna be

We don't mess around
You've got no freedom to come around
We don't take angels from the sky
Oh no no no
But we don't mess around
You're meant to be among the clouds
Cause you're an angel
But that's a lie (x3)

Ain't never gonna be
