hey Bobby Malone it's good to have you home
so you tried your own route & it didn't work out.
well you're not alone

a job that made you crazy in a town you won't miss
& the drunks you called friends were a means to an end
& this is the end

hey Bobby Malone how you have grown
a couple months on the couch while you figure things out
won't do you wrong

hey Bobby Malone

couldn't make rent again or are you in trouble deep
you're a stray dog with fleas & your sister agrees
you've looked better son

hey Bobby Malone it's good to have you home
a couple months on the couch while you figure things out
won't do you wrong

hey Bobby Malone
