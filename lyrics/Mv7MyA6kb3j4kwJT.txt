I drink good coffee every morning
Comes from a place that's far away
And when i'm done I feel like talking
Without you here there is less to say
Don't want you thinking I'm unhappy
What is closer to the truth
If I lived till I was a hundred and two
I just don't think I'll ever get over you
No longer moved to drink strong whiskey
I shook the hand of time and I knew
That if I lived till I could no longer climb my stairs
I just don't think I'll ever get over you
A face that dances and it haunts me
With laughter still ringin' in my ears
I still find pieces of your presence here
even, even after all these years
I don't want you thinkin' that I don't get asked to dinner
Cuz I'm here to say that I sometimes do
And even though I may seem to feel a touch of love
I just don't think I'll ever get over you
If I lived till I was a hundred and two
I just don't think I'll ever get over you
