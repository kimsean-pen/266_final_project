If I was young and you were too
Then I'm sure we'd run away
But life it takes twisted turns
Makes words hard to say
I've been here for too long
My traveling feet all worn down
I try to hide my tears in vain
Take a look a my eyes drown

And all I have is memories
Of a life I once held dear
And all the lights are out tonight
Oh how I wish I wasn't here
