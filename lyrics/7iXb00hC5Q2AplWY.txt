You are the girl that I've been dreaming of
Ever since I was a little girl
You are the girl that I've been dreaming of
Ever since I was a little girl

One, I'm biting my tongue
Two, he's kissin' on you
Three, oh why can't you see?
One, two, three, four

The word's on the streets and it's on the news
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you
He's got two left feet and he bites my moves
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance, dance

The second I do I know we're gonna be through
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you
He don't suspect a thing, I wish he'd get a clue
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance, dance

You are the girl that I've been dreaming of
Ever since I was a little girl
You are the girl that I've been dreaming of
Ever since, ever since

One, I'm biting my tongue
Two, he's kissin' on your hand
Three, oh why can't you see?
One, two, three, four

The word's on the streets and it's on the news
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you
He's got two left feet and he bites my moves
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance, dance

The second I do I know we're gonna be through
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you
He don't suspect a thing, I wish he'd get a clue
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance, dance

One, you're biting my tongue
Two, I'm kissin' on you
Three, is he better than me?
One, two, three, four

The word's on the streets and it's on the news
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you
He's got two left feet and he bites my moves
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance, dance

Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
(I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance, dance)
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
(I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance, dance)
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
(I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance, dance)
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
(I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance, dance)
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
