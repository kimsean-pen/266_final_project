I don't know who you are but I love you
Let me introduce myself
I've been waiting for you my whole life
I'm afraid I'd let you down tonight
Been looking all around for a reason
Something to explain myself
Truth is that I don't know what I'm doing
So excuse me if I'm terrified

I never hold anyone like I do you
You give me reason for the tears and the bleeding

I don't know who you are but I love you
I don't know what you want but I give it to you
And everything I was is forgotten
You're my life, you're my death, you're my final breath
I don't know who you are but I need you
I don't know what you want but I give it to you
I may not always be who you wanted
You're my life, you're my death, you're my final breath

I don't know who you are but I love you
You don't show you understand my words
One day I know I'll disappoint you
'Cause you won't know love without the hurt

I never hold anyone like I do you
You give me reason for the tears and the bleeding

I don't know who you are but I love you
I don't know what you want but I give it to you
And everything I was is forgotten
You're my life, you're my death, you're my final breath
I don't know who you are but I need you
I don't know what you want but I give it to you
I may not always be who you wanted
You're my life, you're my death, you're my final breath

I lost myself to love you

I look at you and see myself
So much you learn, so much you tell
Sometimes the words are living hell
But looking at you I know you're an angel that fell

I never hold anyone like I do you

I don't know who you are but I love you
I don't know what you want but I give it to you
And everything I was is forgotten
You're my life, you're my death, you're my final breath
I don't know who you are but I need you
I don't know what you want but I give it to you
I may not always be who you wanted
You're my life, you're my death, you're my final breath

I lost myself to love you
I lost myself just to love you
