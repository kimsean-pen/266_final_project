Enforced by priests of lies
The injure time of an evil seed
The altar of damnation
Surrounds the victim for the daemon feed
Gathering for the ritual
Awaiting for the holy blood to flow
Spirits scorning the christian empire
Infesting the victim while blood comes forth

Dawn has come for the invocation
Experiencing the scarificial rites
Pain has gone beyond laceration
The master of gods arise

Another victim dies
Disciples of God fear their destiny
The damnation has come
No escape from the flames of the deceased
Chanting the hymn of death
The wrath of Satan slowly ends their lives
The last souls sees his time
Preparing for the sacrifice soon to be done

Dawn has come for the invocation
Experiencing the sacrificial rites
Pain has gone beyond laceration
The master of gods arise

Burning candles light the darkened realm
Final of the ritual visions never seen
Time draws nearer the hour of dying
The last victim led to the altar of disease
