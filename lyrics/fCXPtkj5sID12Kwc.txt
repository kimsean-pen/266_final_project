He slept in my bed after I filled his body with insects and panic and grandfather sewn seeds
I was useless inside him; trade organs for oceans
Is there a vaccine for this?
To clean out all the unborn kids?
Ohhhhhhh

He broke me good where the landlord left scars
Emptied all the bedrooms to reclaim the stretch marks
We were to our throats in grass
We tore down the treehouses
And our brothers were kindling for the love songs that we couldn't sing
Ohhhhhh

'Cause we drowned all our songs in the bathtub
You could hear them way up in the rafters
And the preachers sleeping in the attic stole them all for scriptures
We sing nothing now, our mothers ask us how
We pray with the lights out for songs to fill our mouths
Ohhhhhh
