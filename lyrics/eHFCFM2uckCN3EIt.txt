Myriads of silver discs
Signals have been noticed
Out on the drift

Here comes the flashover
From our new neighbor
Here comes the flashover
Behold new colors

Messages, fresh images
The over mind
Has noticed another shift

Never seen before
Others bring new dawns
Colored grays are on display
The waiting is no more

Never seen before
Others bring new dawns
Imagination's opening
Inviting us on board

Here comes the flashover

Myriads of silver discs
The over mind
Has signaled another lift

Dimensions of time have come undone
Now we have become so unalone

Migration, space, extensions, differences
Information increases becoming
What the mystery is
