Infested rats of illusive goodness
Emerge yourself and show your face to me
My violent wrath is the last thing you will ever see
Pain and suffering will haunt your kind
Respect is none, value like a flea
Before a molested kingdom you are blind

Quick and painless ending isn't worthy of his grace
The hammer of death will strike endlessly

Bloodline of Lucifer, rise up high
In your death my salvation lies
I will hate you till the end of days
You, your followers and your disgusting ways

Extermination of mankind will set my essence free
When Armageddon's thunder roar you will come to realize
My eyes burn with hate when I see your face
Storm of the Antichrist will rage upon thee

Quick and painless ending isn't worthy of his grace
The hammer of death will strike endlessly

Bloodline of Lucifer, rise up high
In your death my salvation lies
I will hate you till the end of days
You, your followers and your disgusting ways
