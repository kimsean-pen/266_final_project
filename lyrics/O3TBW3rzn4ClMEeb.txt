Many nights we prayed
With no proof, anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song

We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long

Before we knew we could, yes
There can be miracles
When you believe

Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve

When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird

Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My hearts so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words

I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles
When you believe (When you believe)

Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve)

When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

An' though they don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in, to your fears

But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain
A small but still, resilient voice
Says help is very near

There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah, though hope is frail)
Though hope is frail (It's hard)
It's hard to kill (Hard to kill, yeah)

Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve)
When you believe, somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)
Somehow you will (I know, I know, know)
You will when you believe (When you)
You will when you
(You will when you believe)
(Just believe)
(Just believe)
You will when you believe
