In the weak light
I saw you becoming the lie
Taking it all for granted
Like freedom
It's something you'll never have

Forget what's said
And hear me sing to you
How I've set out to kill my soul
The nightward ways
The labour it brings
The verdict that I came for
Migration's song

Patterns of death overwhelms
Fixation rise
I came along the way
And came to a conclusion
The indifferent sky
Is made of lead and so beautiful
Submission
Come you will

The parting
End origin
Fade into earth

Times ablaze
Under the flags we chose
Denied my step and froze my heart
Yet I stare
With nothing left to do
The verdict that I came for
Migration's song

Take your well deserved step
Into darkness
I'll become your eyes
You have no other
We have to walk along the wire
Trust the one that never trusted you
