Don't let go... don't let go... don't let go

Holding my breath as i walk to your garden
Everything seems so abandoned
Roses have grown just as high as A mountain
Fireflies glow in the dark

Dont let go now (don't let go)
Somebody is lying

Everyone came to the final revival
Its been a year since we've been here
The spell has been cast to welcome the arrival
The phantom of silence is near

Dont let go now (don't let go)
Your garden is dying
These wounds wont heal (don't let go)
Somebody is lying

Break the spell of emptiness

And thousand year of loneliness
Bless the path of righteousness
And walk the trails of holiness
Your garden is dying
Somebody is lying

Dont let go now (don't let go)
Your garden is dying
These wounds wont heal (don't let go)
Somebody is lying

Ohhh oh oh ohhhhh
YOUR garden is dying
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Somebody is lying

Ah ahahahaha
ONE of us is lying
Ah ah ah ah
