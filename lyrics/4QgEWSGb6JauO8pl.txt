All these things, they drowned you
Down and take you take you up
Let it go I try to
Pull you up and fall
Back down
You come around
You fall back down
You come around

Stash you in the backseat
Just to fool them all
"Give it up," they tell me
The light can't slow my fall
Back down
You come around
You fall back down
You come around

Back down
You come around
You fall back down
You come around

Back down
You come around
You fall back down
You come around
