I bet you're attractive
But oh my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you
Sweetie pie
All the day and night time
Hear me sigh

Crush on you
Sweetie pie
All the day and night time
Hear me sigh

I've got a c-c-crush on you
Sweetie pie
All the day and night time
Hear me sigh

Crush on you
Sweetie pie
All the day and night time
Hear me sigh

I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion
