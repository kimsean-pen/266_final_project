(Jorn Lande)

It was a long time ago
Where the snowy winds blow
In the land of midnight sun
In a storm sailed a viking ship
On a vast and long trip
The adventure has just begun
They were cold men of steel
With their swords and their shields

Tungur Knivur - Heavy Knife - Tung Kniv
There was thunder at the edge of the world
Tungur Knivur - Heavy Knife - Tung Kniv
Out to plunder with blades of steel

On the shore stood a warrior
His eyes blue and sore, yeah
The only one to make it home
His soul was black as the raven
Dark since the day when
His wounds had turned his heart to stone
He was strong without fear
Hear a sound so clear

Tungur Knivur - Heavy Knife - Tung Kniv
There was thunder at the edge of the world
Tungur Knivur - Heavy Knife - Tung Kniv
Out to plunder with blades of steel

Looking back at what was then
It was bravey of men
But time was bound to change everything
They would burn upon the cross
Branded by a sacred cause
Icon shadows turned to dust

Tungur Knivur - Heavy Knife - Tung Kniv
There was thunder at the edge of the world
Tungur Knivur - Heavy Knife - Tung Kniv
Out to plunder with blades of steel

Tungur Knivur - Heavy Knife - Tung Kniv
There's a fire at the edge of the world
Tungur Knivur - Heavy Knife - Tung Kniv
Out to plunder with their blades of steel

Tungur Knivur - Heavy Knife - Tung Kniv
There was thunder at the edge of the world
