I see myself in the mirror
At eight years old, wondering will I look like the faces
I see on the magazines
Will the world think I'm pretty
If I dress like this, walk like that
See myself in the mirror
I remember how

I stole my mother's makeup, trying to look all grown up
What are you doing?
She said, what are you doing?
Trying to cover up my freckles
Wanna look just like the others
What are you doing?
She said, the truth is

You're perfect, you're worth it
Don't go breaking your mother's heart
You're perfect, you're worth it
Don't go breaking your mother's heart
We are designed like this
You are the greatest gift
You're perfect, you're worth it
Don't go breaking your mother's heart

I see myself in the school yard
At twelve years old I was told
I didn't look like the others
So I choose to take control
I will do it on purpose
If I don't fit in, I won't fit in
See myself in the mirror
I remember how

I cut my childhood curls off
Forgot my natural colours
What are you doing?
I thought, what are you doing?
I'm a rebel for no reason
Still searching for the real me
What are you doing?
You know the truth is

You're perfect, you're worth it
Don't go breaking your mother's heart
You're perfect, you're worth it
Don't go breaking your mother's heart
We are designed like this
You are the greatest gift
You're perfect, you're worth it
Don't go breaking your mother's heart

If I have a daughter
I'll sit her down and say
Don't ever let them change you
Don't even fade away

If I have a daughter
I'll sit her down and say
Don't break your mother's heart
â€˜Cause she made you this way

You're perfect, you're worth it
Don't go breaking your mother's heart
You're perfect, you're worth it
Don't go breaking your mother's heart
We are designed like this
You are the greatest gift
You're perfect, you're worth it
Don't go breaking your mother's heart

Don't go breaking
Don't go breaking
Don't go breaking
Don't go breaking your mother's heart

Don't go breaking
Don't go breaking
Don't go breaking
Don't go breaking your mother's heart
