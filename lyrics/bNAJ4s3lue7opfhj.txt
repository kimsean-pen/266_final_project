Light a candle for the two of us
Let it burn until it fades to dust
As the glow reflects into your eyes
We'll make a promise until the end of time

Let's burn this city to the ground
And dance upon the ashes
Then no one will be around
And we'll have no distractions

Light a candle for the two of us
Let it burn until it fades to dust
As the glow reflects into your eyes
We'll make a promise until the end of time

When everything's a lie
Just sit and shut your eyes
The truth is hard to find
Young child

Let's burn the city to the ground
And dance upon the ashes
Then no one will be around
And we'll have no distractions
