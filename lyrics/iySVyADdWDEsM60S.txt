... Baby One More Time - Tove Styrke
Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because
My loneliness is killing me
And I
I must confess I still believe
I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Mmm, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because
My loneliness is killing me
And I
I must confess I still believe
I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
Stop believe
Stop believe
