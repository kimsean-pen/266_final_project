As If we need a 'why' I'll be it
I'll be the 'who for' and apocalypse how
If the world had one neck
My hands would be the 'where' and I would choke all of you down
I would choke all of you down
I would choke all of you down

Give me a picket sign
And make it blank and white
Like all those stupid teenage girls
We're gonna need 'em where we're going tonight

All you fuckers vote beep, beep, beep
In drunk karaoke cars
If it's too dumb to see or say, you still sing it
And I just cue the applause

Let's make sure the music's loud enough
We won't even hear it end
Let's make sure the music's loud enough
We won't even hear it end

Give me a picket sign
Make it blank and white
Like all those stupid teenage girls
We're gonna need 'em where we're going tonight

I want to celebrate, I want to sell your hate
Today's the day you're gonna fucking die
I want to celebrate, I want to sell your hate
Your demons wanna give you a proper goodbye

And all you fuckers vote beep, beep, beep
In drunk karaoke cars
If it's too dumb to see or say, you still sing it
And I just cue the applause
If it's too dumb to see or say, you still sing it
And I just cue the applause

Give me a picket sign
Make it blank and white
Like all those stupid teenage girls
We're gonna need 'em where we're going tonight

I want to celebrate, I want to sell your hate
Today's the day you're gonna fucking die
I want to celebrate, I want to sell your hate
Your demons wanna give you a proper goodbye

I want to celebrate, I want to sell your hate
Today's the day you're gonna fucking die
I want to celebrate, I want to sell your hate
Your demons wanna give you a proper goodbye

Give me a picket sign
God is dead but God is still white
Let's shoot up the mall, the school
Or the president of whatever
Or who ever wants a fight

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Let's make sure the music's loud enough
Let's make sure the music's loud enough
Let's make sure the music's loud enough
We won't even hear it end, end, end, end

Let's make sure the music's loud enough
We won't even hear it end
