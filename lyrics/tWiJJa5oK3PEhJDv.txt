People try to help me
Their words are no better than mines
I'm sick of trying to keep straight
When I know that it's too late

There's nothing left to do
I think I blew my cool

Floating in the mess I made
Losing when the cards are laid
But the sympathy that you give to me, is all i really need
And when you lose control, you lose control
You need someone to hold, you need someone to hold

I'm broken beat, I've had enough, I'm tired of acting tough
I'm giving up, I'm giving up

Floating in the mess I made
Losing when the cards are laid
But the sympathy that you give to me, is all i really need
And when you lose control, you lose control
You need someone to hold, you need someone to hold

I'm broken beat, I've had enough, I'm tired of acting tough
I'm giving up, I'm giving up
