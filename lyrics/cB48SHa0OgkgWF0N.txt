Who wants to dance, who wants to slow dance
Whit that rabbit down the hole rabbit down the hole
I want a chance I want to slow dance
And trap that rabbit down the hole rabbit down the hole
Lipstick like dynamite, seven sticks of dynamite
Lipstick like dynamite
Lipstick like dynamite, seven sticks of dynamite
Lipstick Like dynamite (dynamite)
Ooh ooh oh oh oh ooohh

Who wants to dance, who wants to slow dance
To that racket down the hall that racket down the hall
Woo I want to dance I want to slow dance
And trap that racket down the hall racket down the hole
Lipstick like dynamite, seven sticks of dynamite
Lipstick like dynamite (dynamite)
Lipstick like dynamite, seven sticks of dynamite
Lipstick like dynamite (dynamite)
COME ON!!!
(choir harmonizing)
Seven sticks of dynamite, Fuse the morning fuse the night
Seven sticks of dynamite, Fuse the morning fuse the night
Seven sticks of dynamite, Fuse the morning fuse the night
Seven sticks of dynamite, Fuse the morning fuse the night
Seven sticks of dynamite, Fuse the morning fuse the night
Seven sticks of dynamite, Fuse the morning fuse the night

Fuse the morning fuse the night
Fuse the morning fuse the night
Fuse the morning fuse the night
Give me seven sticks of dynamite
(the best song ever)
