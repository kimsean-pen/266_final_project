All these visions in my head
Should've gone to bed before the water shed
Some are live and some are dead
Makes no difference when they're in your head, head

Keep the door, open a crack
So I can see them when they attack
Some are white and some are black
Makes no difference when they're on your back

And I can't stop crying
And I can't stop driving
'Cause the day is dying, dying, dying
And my eyes wide open

Count the sheep jumping the fence
So I can see tinkers when I'm feeling tense
Disbelief hung in suspense
Eiderdown is my own defense

And I can't stop crying
And I can't stop driving
'Cause the day is dying, dying, dying
And my eyes wide open

All these visions in my head
Should've gone to bed before the water shed
Some are live and some are dead
Makes no difference when they're in your head

And I can't stop crying
And I can't stop driving
'Cause the day is dying, dying, dying
My eyes wide open
