I guess i should've known
It wasn't gonna end okay
You're such a troublemaker
But i like it just that way.

A bomb tick ticking With neither one of us to blame
Just like a countdown ready to blow
I sat around a lot and thought
About the world without you
no matter what you think
Everything is not about you
You think i'm still hung up on you
well baby it's not true
Now look at me
the memories turn to dust

There is only one explanation
I wasn't really in love
(i wasn't really in love)
It was just a crush
It was just a crush
Sparks fly when we touch
It was never enough
It was just a crush
It was just a crush
Yeah
you throw away the things
you need

There's nothing left to lose
The things i never wanna be
I owe it all to you
You just can't help yourself
It's just what you do
'cause this is real life
Not a Show
Now look at me

The memories turn to dust
There is only one explanation
I wasn't really in love
(i wasn't really in love)
It was just a crush
It was just a crush
Sparks fly when we touched
It was never enough
It was just a crush
It was just a crush
Yeah
You'll be fine

Just find another girl
To kick around
Won't be long
Until they all know what
I figured out
Now look at me

the Memories turn to dust
There's only one explanation
I wasn't really in love

(i wasn't really in love)
It was just a crush
(it just was a crush)
Sparks fly when we touched
It was never enough
It was just a crush
It was just a crush (it was just a crush)
Yeah
(it was just a crush)
It was just a crush
Yeah.
