You are the sweetest disease for me
I can't hear you say please to me
There's nothing you cannot say to me
Come on get down and pray with me

Get down
Shut up
Come on in
It's time to take your medicine
I'm unfit
I'm unfair
You can't feel
And I don't care
Get down
Shut up
Come on in
It's time to take your medicine
I'll wipe a stripe on you tonight
I'll tee you high and you will fly

There's no feeling inside of me
You'll see nothing can hide in me
You'll find nothing can feed on me
Don't look, listen or believe in me

Get down
Shut up
Come on in
It's time to take your medicine
I'm unfit
I'm unfair
You can't feel
And I don't care
Get down
Shut up
Come on in
It's time to take your medicine
I'll wipe a stripe on you tonight
I'll tee you high and you will fly

You are the sweet disease in me
I cannot hear your pleas to me
There's nothing you can't say to me
Come on and get down and play with me

Get down
Shut up
Come on in
It's time to take your medicine
I'm unfit
I'm unfair
You can't feel
And I don't care
Get down
Shut up
Come on in
It's time to take your medicine
I'll wipe a stripe on you tonight
I'll tee you high and you will fly

Get down
Shut up
Come on in
It's time to take your medicine
I'm unfit
I'm unfair
You can't feel
And I don't care
Get down

You are the sweet disease in me
I cannot hear your pleas to me
There's nothing you can't say to me
Come on and get down and play with me
