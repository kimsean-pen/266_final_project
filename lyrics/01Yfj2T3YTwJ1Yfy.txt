I've got my finger on the trigger
One bullet in the gun
And I'm spinning the revolver
Thinking this could be the one

I tried to find religion
To see what I've become
I was ruined by the world
But I blamed it on the Son

Am I worthless, am I filthy?
Am I too far gone for a remedy?
Will you help me, cause I'm dying
To be something more than a memory
If I reach out, can I trust You?
Will You help me see the light of one more day?
Take the bullets away!

I tried to build resistance
I tried to start a war
But no-one ever listened
I bottled up the storm

Am I worthless, am I filthy?
Am I too far gone for a remedy?
Will you help me, cause I'm dying
To be something more than a memory
If I reach out, can I trust You?
Will You help me see the light of one more day?
Take the bullets away!

You're so disarming
There's nothing left to fear
You're so disarming
I drop all my weapons to show You that I'm not afraid
Take the bullets away!

Am I worthless, am I filthy?
Am I too far gone for a remedy?
Will you help me, cause I'm dying
To be something more than a memory
If I reach out, can I trust You?
Will You help me see the light of one more day?
