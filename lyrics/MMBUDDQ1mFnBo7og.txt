The second-hand looks like a knife
As it's counting down the rest of our lives
So hard to swallow
No steps to follow
It became so hard to survive

Dear Youth
What was your one big plan?
You made us believe we had the world in our hands
We left home with nowhere to go
Facing our fears as we brave the unknown

All I have to keep are these jaded old memories
From screams of how it used to be
I once was blind
But now I can see
That words of rationality
Were wasted on me

So I said goodbye
It's just a memory that hasn't come to be
But I recognize
That if you're on the right track
But catch the wrong train
Nothing ends the same

Dear Youth
What was your one big plan?
You made us believe we had the world in our hands
We left home with nowhere to go
Facing our fears as we brave the unknown
Dear Youth
Put back those thoughts in my head
The ones where I believe that I am boundless again
I know we're at the end of the road
This is our story
This was our home

We were unbreakable

Alive and well
The days are shrinking
Alive and well
Each moment more fleeting
Alive and well
We gave our best
Alive and well
You know the rest
