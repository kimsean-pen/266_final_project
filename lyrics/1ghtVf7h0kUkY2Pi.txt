I'm seemin' to be a little odd
I'm happy again, caught, caught in time
You 'spose the daughter of yourself
Well, me, I give in to your arms

You're the mad, chokecherry coal
That will burn this old madhouse down
And I'll throw open like a walnut safe
More like a love that's a bottle of exquisite stuff, yes

You, yourself, and your father
Don't know but in your own ways
You're really both bone setters
Thank you for mending me babies

You're the mad, chokecherry coal
That will burn this old madhouse down
And I'll throw open like a walnut safe
You will seem that being throughout
That same bottle of exquisite stuff
Yes, you are the mad, chokecherry coal
That will burn this old madhouse down
And I'll throw open like the walnut safe

You, yourself, and your father
Don't know but in your own ways
You're really both bone setters
Thank you for mending me babies
