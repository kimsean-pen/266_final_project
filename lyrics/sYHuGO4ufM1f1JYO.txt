Happier than ever before
No second chances
Cause I love my friends and my opponents
You were still the same as me
Only I enhance it
Magic lives in this sacred moment
I am here and I'm still free
See my flame's still dancing
My eclipse's in for your enjoyment
Feel this conscience's energy
And on these romancing
Life is better when you're open

Live today, if only for one moment
The light of your life is everywhere
Live today, if only for one moment
The light of your life is everywhere, where
Everywhere, where

I am not the sun of your imagination
Yet the sum to your harmony and brighter places
Oh I am just a higher tangible dimension
Yet some roaming 'round us walking like we're sweet intention
Darkness can't survive within this lighter presence
Hold on to the moment like you truly meant to
Oh take a break from everything with no exception
Just a lot amongst the ambience like this presenting

Live today, if only for one moment
The light of your life is everywhere
Live today, if only for one moment
The light of your life is everywhere, where (it's everywhere)
Where, where

This is the love we thought we never had
Just know everything is over when it's meant
And I hope you see for what it is instead
All the pleasures in this same environment
This is the love we thought we never had
Just know everything is over when it's meant
And I hope you see for what it is instead
All the pleasures in this same environment
