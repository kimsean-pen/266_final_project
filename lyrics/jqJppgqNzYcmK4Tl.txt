You know you make me crazy
And my mind is racing
You're wastin' all my time
Someone come and save me
Oh, yeah

'Cause when I need you
I can see through
And I feel you
Right now
On my highway
Doin' my way
And I want you to feel
When I'm going down

'Cause I am not afraid
And I won't go down in flames
'Cause nothing's gonna be the same
And everything you know
You keep inside your soul
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be John Wayne
Oh, yeah

Our golden days are chasin'
And you're not gonna face it
The reason's in the rhyme
You walked on what was sacred
Oh, yeah

And when I need you
I can reach through
And I feel you
Right now
It's a new day
But your skies are grey
And I want you to feel
When I'm going down

'Cause I am not afraid
And I won't go down in flames
'Cause nothing's gonna be the same
And everything you know
You keep inside your soul
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be John Wayne

Everything you know
You keep inside your soul
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be John Wayne

I am not afraid
And I won't go down in flames
'Cause nothing's gonna be the same
And everything you know
You keep inside your soul
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be John Wayne
I am not afraid
And I won't go down in flames
'Cause nothing's gonna be the same
And everything you know
You keep inside your soul
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be John Wayne
