I see you shaking in your boots
Why won't you put your petty fears aside
It's time to get your dancing shoes
Well I'm about to show you why

And I'm not afraid to use it
You want more
I can show you how we do it
Don't just stand, just stand still
Don't just stand, just stand still
Don't just stand, just stand still
Don't just stand, 'cause I, I got, I got soul

I've got a rhythm you can't lose
If you let your body lead the way
It's just a syncopated groove
It might be more than you can take

And I'm not afraid to use it
You want more
I can show you how we do it
Don't just stand, just stand still
Don't just stand, just stand still
Don't just stand, just stand still
Don't just stand, 'cause I, I got, I got soul

And I'm not afraid to use it
You want more
Let me show you how we do it
'Cause you know that I got soul
