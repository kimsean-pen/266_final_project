The ending's the same
Past mistakes that you made
Come back to haunt you, you
I made a mistake, I wish I could take
Back everything that I did
I wanted to tell you, I really did
But how do I explain this?
Promise me you will be there
Until the red light will change
I would wait forever
Promise me you will stay here
Until the darkness will fade

I'd wait for you, you

A mistake, wish I could take
Back everything that I did
I wanted to tell you, I really did
But how do I explain?
Promise me you will be there
Until the red light will change
I would wait forever
Promise me you will stay here
Until the darkness will fade
I'd wait for you
A mistake and I'm all on my own, away
Wait for you
A mistake and I'm all on my own, by myself
Wait for you
I'd wait for you... for you
I'd wait for you
