Blind me
Erase what was
Stillborn I have become

The feelings I once felt are now dead and gone
I've waited here for you for so very long

So empty
Just a shell of a man
Stillborn, this I understand

The feelings I once felt are now dead and gone
I've waited here for you for so very long

I've waited here for you, so long
I've waited here for you, for you

The feelings I once felt are now dead and gone
I've waited here for you for so very long

I've waited here for you, so long
I've waited here for you, so long
I've waited here for you, so long
I've waited here for you, for you
