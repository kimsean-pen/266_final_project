She said "I'm fine, I'm okay"
Cover up your trembling hands
There's indecision when you know you ain't got nothing left
When the good times never stay
And the cheap thrills always seem to fade away
When will we fall
When will we fall down

Jump back, gotta get out of here
Been too, too long this time
Jump back, gotta get out of here
When will, when will we fall down

She hates her life, she hates her skin
She even hates her friends
Tries to hold on to all the reputations she can't mend
And there's some chance we could fail
But the last time, someone's always there for bail
When will we fall
When will we fall down

Jump back, gotta get out of here
Been too, too long this time
Jump back, gotta get out of here
When will, when will we fall down
When will we, when will we fall down
When will we fall

She said "I'm fine, I'm okay"
Cover up your trembling hands
There's indecision when you know you ain't got nothing left
For the last time conscience calls
For a good friend, I was never there at all
When will we fall
When will we fall down

Jump back, gotta get out of here
Been too, too long this time
Jump back, gotta get out of here
When will, when will we fall down
When will we, when will we fall down
When will we fall
