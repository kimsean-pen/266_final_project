this Restless sea is breaking me.
fire on my back the ocean lights me
watching Through The Eyes of a crow
I let it guide me. I let it in
the end is endless and washing over me
reaching for me to tear me apart
I washed it away so long ago
but it returns to seed
I do see Beauty full of pain
I let it guide me I let it in
the end is endless end overseeing me
peeling the skin away reveals the heart
feed the Levee shallow Graves
to damn the ever breaking tides
free my soul from the nihil Waves
to forgive and to decline
