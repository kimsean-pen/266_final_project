I kissed the kids at noon
Then stumbled out the room
I caught a cab

Ran up a tab
On 7th and flower
Beth's recital I had to run
Missed my son's graduation

Punched the Nichols boy
For taking his seat
He gets all that anger from me
Still things could be much worse
Natural disasters on the evening news

Still things could be much worse
We still got our health
My paycheck in the mail
I promised to my wife and children
I'd never touch another drink

As long as I live
But even then
It sounds so soothing
This will blow over in time
This will all blow over in time

I'm just an honest man
Provide for me and mine
I give a check to tax-deductible
Charity organizations
Two weeks paid vacation won't
Heal the damage done

I need another one
Still things could be much worse
Natural disasters on the evening news
Still things could be much worse

We still got our health
My paycheck in the mail
I promised to my wife and children
I'd never touch another drink
As long as I live
But even then
It sounds so soothing
To mix a gin
And sink into oblivion
I promised to my wife and children
That accident
Left everyone a little shook up
But at the meetings
I felt so empty
This will blow over in time
This will all blow over in time
