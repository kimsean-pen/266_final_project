Kaleidescoping all around the room
Excited by the shape of you in bloom
We were never ordinary
And I know you saw it too
When you looked at me I looked right back at you

No, no, no one else understands us
Ta-tattooed on my heart is a bandage
No, no, no one else understands us
And I think to myself

Goddamn what a beautiful world
Limitless
Oh, like we were kids
Goddamn, why'd I ever let go?
We were gold
Oh, when we were kids

Colour morning creeping up your skin
And the carousel inside me starts to spin
And the sheets expose your shoulders
It hits how deep I'm in
Could we be as close as we felt before again?

No, no, no one else understands us
Ta-tattooed on my heart is a bandage
No, no, no one else understands us
And I think to myself

Goddamn what a beautiful world
Limitless
Oh, like we were kids
Goddamn, why'd I ever let go?
We were gold
Oh, when we were kids

Yeah, the days they change
Yeah, the days they change
Yeah, the days they change
Yeah, the days they change

Goddamn what a beautiful world
Limitless
Oh, like we were kids
Goddamn, why'd I ever let go?
We were gold
Oh, when we were kids

Goddamn what a beautiful world
Limitless
Oh, like we were kids
Goddamn, why'd I ever let go?
We were gold
Oh, when we were kids
