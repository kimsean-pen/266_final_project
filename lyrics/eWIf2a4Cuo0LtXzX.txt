We are primordial sound
Outward and in, omnidirectional
We are existence

Salvage the mother sun
Destroy the rest
Bring knowledge back to light
Of this in-sentimental [?]conspiracy[?]
Now rise

Balance seeks its place
Moving backwards towards the centre sun
Rooted in intuition
We are the language

Sink in the ebb and flow
Ebb and flow, sink in
