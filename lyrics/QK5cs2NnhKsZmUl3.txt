was alone
I was made of stone
You took me home
We built a world

A world for us
We flew like birds
A new beginning
It's better
Better
Better
You are keeping me together
.Gether
.Gether

You know that I will never

Never
Never

Try to pull you down
Down

Lover
Lover
Lover

You can always be here
I'll take cover
You know that I will never
Never
Never
Leave you all alone
I'd be nothing if it wasn't for you...
If it wasn't for you...

I was a fool
Always keeping a distance
If I'd ever know
You found a way
I thought I always stayed the same
Because of you
I saw a new beginning
It's better
Better
Better
You are keeping me together
.Gether
.Gether
You know that I will never
Never
Never
Try to pull you down
Down
Lover
Lover
Lover
You can always be here
I'll take cover
You know that I will never
Never
Never
Leave you all alone
I'd be nothing if it wasn't for you...
If it wasn't for you...
I'd be nothing if it wasn't for you...
I'd be nothing if it wasn't for you...

I'd be nothing if it wasn't for you...
If it wasn't for you...
