We shoot power to your heart, a mighty thunderbolt
We charge all batteries, we save your soul
We don't know when we're licked, but we turn lead to gold
We know alchemy, we bring you rock 'n' roll

We are the ones you love, or we're the ones you hate
We are the ones always too early or too late
We are the first and we just still might be the last
We are Motörhead, born to kick your ass

We bring the firestorm to brighten up your life
We mend all broken hearts, we cure all pain
We bring you attitude and razor teeth to bite
We bring machine gun law and we're the ones to blame

We are the ones you need, the ones that you despise
We are the ones who wanna poke you in the eye
We are the future, baby, used to be the past
We are Motörhead and we don't have no class

We bring you UFOs, saucers in the sky
We shoot you full of noise, we aim to kill
We burn like motherfuckers, spit right in your eye
We fight authority, we glorify free will

We are the ones you heard of, but you never heard
We are electric prophets, here to twist the world
We are the flame at night, the fire in the trash
We are Motörhead, we are Motörhead
We are Motörhead, we are Motörhead
We are Motörhead, we are Motörhead
