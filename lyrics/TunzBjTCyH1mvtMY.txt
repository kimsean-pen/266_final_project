I'll tell you why I
Don't want to know where you are
I got a joke I've been
Dying to tell you

A silent kid is looking
Down the barrel
To make the noise that I
Kept so quiet

Kept it from you, Pitseleh

I'm not what's missing
From your life now
I could never be the
Puzzle pieces

They say that God makes problems
Just to see what you could stand
Before you do as the
Devil pleases

Give up the thing you love

No one deserves it

The first time I saw you
I knew it would never last
I'm not half what I
Wish I was

I'm so angry
I don't think it'll ever pass
And I was bad news for you
Just because
I never meant to hurt you
