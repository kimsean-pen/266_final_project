Hyped up, ready to go, I got my eyes on the prize
I'm sick of feeling the lows, I wanna roll with the highs
I took a different path, I did it all on my own, so

Whole world ready for me, I got a vision in mind
It's time to roll up my sleeves, you know I'm feelin' alive
I took a different path, I did it all on my own, so

I've been hoping that my dreams come true
And I'm hoping that I'll make it with you

(One, two, three, four)
Count it out, count it out
One, two, three, four, five, six
Work it out, work it out
Think we're gonna make it
Shout it out, shout it out
One, two, three, four, five, six
Do you feel the vibe yet?

Count it out, count it out
Let me hear your zip code
Work it out, work it out
Feelin' like a Van Gogh
Worldwide, worldwide
One, two, three, four, five, six
Do you feel the vibe yet?

Hyped up, look at us go, we could shoot for the stars
Gonna start a parade, say the future is ours
It's a beautiful day, we did it all on our own, so

I've been hoping that my dreams come true
And I'm hoping that I'll make it with you

(One, two, three, four)
Count it out, count it out
One, two, three, four, five, six
Work it out, work it out
Think we're gonna make it
Shout it out, shout it out
One, two, three, four, five, six
Do you feel the vibe yet?

Count it out, count it out
Let me hear your zip code
Work it out, work it out
Feelin' like a Van Gogh
