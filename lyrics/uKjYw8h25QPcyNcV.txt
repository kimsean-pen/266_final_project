I can take one day to achieve my goal then it starts again
In this circumstance that I call my own dreams just don't deliver
I never needed forever feeling low cause they break me down cannot fake this frown
I never took offence I never swore in advance
But I'll break you down with my poison mouth again
I cannot deny bittersweet recline to a sole religion
It's certain way that I'm feeling host to a new deception...
In this cold life...
