words and guitar
I got it, words and guitar
I want it, way, way too loud
I got it words and guitar
I want it all
(can't take this away from me)
I want it all
(music is the air I breathe)
I want it
(can't take this away from me)
words and guitar

take, take the noise in my head
take, take the noise in my head
c'mon and turn, turn it up
I wanna turn, turn you on
I play it all
(feel the space surrounding me)
I play it all
(loud as it could ever be)
I play it
(feel the space surrounding me)
words and guitar

I dream of quiet songs
I hear the silky sounds
hush, hush and rock
oh give me pretty song
oh let me have that sound
tonight

words and guitar
I got it, words and guitar
I want it, way, way too loud
I want it words and guitar
I got it all
(tell me what you want of me)
I got it all
(tell me what you want of me)
I got it
(tell me what you want of me)
words and guitar

take, take the noise in my head
(well you want it or you don't)
take, take the noise in my head
(either you'll come or you won't)
c'mon and turn, turn it up
(it's the thing you'll never know)
I wanna turn, turn you on
(it's the thing you'll never own)
I want it all
(rock you till your good and dead)
I want it all
(rock you till there's nothing left)
I want it
(rock you till your good and dead)

I dream of quiet sounds

oh give me pretty song
