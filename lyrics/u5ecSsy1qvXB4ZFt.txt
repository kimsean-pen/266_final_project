When the sun goes down and my shirt comes off
When he spins me round and then I take his off
I know. Oh, I know
Yeah he slips it in and then I slip away
And when he kisses my neck I turn the other way
'Cos I know. Oh, I know
If he hurts me slow
I gotta let him go
He's gonna hurt me slow
Oh I know
Yeah he takes me far and then he brings me back
He's got me breathing hard
He's pressed against my back
'Cos I know. Oh I know
Yeah he's over me just the way I like it
When I'm under him he feels alright
'Cos I know. I know
If he hurts me slow
I gotta let him go
He's gonna hurt me slow
Oh I know
When the sun goes down and my shirt comes off
When he spins me round and then I take his off
I know. Oh, I know
Yeah he slips it in and then I slip away
And when he kisses my neck I turn the other way
'Cos I know. Oh, I know
If he hurts me slow
I gotta let him go
He's gonna hurt me slow
Oh I know
