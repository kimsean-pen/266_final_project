What a colossal navigational problem,
I seem to be a vegetable.
No power up packs or inventions of the same degree,
I wish that I had worn a warmer jumper.

Face on the floor, no coming back,
I'm the creation old mate Frankenstein had.
Dead end signals from head to feet,
Blinking in morse code for a state of emergency.

Commencing mission for face control,
Some kind of upper would be optimal,
Clear transmission to re-upload,
They stated, MIA on Kepler 1.

Eight hours in and there's no sign I'll be touching down,
Hopefully there's no need for therapy yet.
I'll just fit in and be like everyone else.
Stop all your thinking it's no good for your soul.

Face on the floor, no coming back,
I'm the creation old mate Frankenstein had.
Dead end signals from head to feet,
Blinking in morse code for a state of emergency.

Commencing mission for face control,
Some kind of upper would be optimal,
Clear transmission to re-upload,
