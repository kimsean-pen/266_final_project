Purity of heart
Is to will one thing
Today I will
Take a walk
Twig says to me
"I'm just a tree"
Grass says "me too"
I say "no you
You're just a grass"
Grass says "no I
Could be a tree
If just I tried"
I say "no shame
In being a grass"
Twig says
"I'm
Trying to do that"
I say "no twig
You just be you"

Grass and twig both say together
"No you"

You ever tried
To just think one thought
To think it all straight
Think it a lot
Think it all though
And see where you get
And when you arrive
Think it again
To will one thing straight
To will one thing true
To will to be someone
Who isn't not you
To love yourself enough
To love someone else
To fall through a hole
Ya doored[?] in yourself
