I want you to know that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both

An older version of me, is she perverted like me
Would she go down on your in a theatre?
Does she speak eloquently? And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother

'Cause the love that you gave that we made
wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died, 'til you died
but you're still alive

And I'm here to remind you
of the mess you left when you went away
it's not fair to deny me
of the cross I bear that you gave to me
you, you, you oughta know

You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know

Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
But it was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her

'Cause the love that you gave that we made
wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died, 'til you died
but you're sill alive

And I'm here to remind you
of the mess you left when you went away
it's not fair to deny me
of the cross I bear that you gave to me
you, you, you oughta know

'Cause the joke that you made in the bed that was me
And I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes, and you know it
And every time I scratch my nails

down someone else's back I hope you feel it... well can you feel it
Well I'm here to remind you
of the mess you left when you went away
it's not fair to deny me
of the cross I bear that you gave to me
you, you, you oughta know
I'm here to remind you
of the mess you left when you went away
it's not fair to deny me
of the cross I bear that you gave to me
you, you, you oughta know
