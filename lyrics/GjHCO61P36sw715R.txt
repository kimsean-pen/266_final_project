You feel like Steve McQueen
When you're driving in your car
And you think you look like James Bond
When you're smoking your cigar
It's so bizarre you think you are
A new kind of James Dean
But the only thing I've ever seen of you

Was a commercial spot on the screen

Movie Star, Movie Star, ahahar
You think you are a movie
Movie Star, Movie Star, ahahar
You think you are a Movie Star, ahahar

You should belong to the jet set
Fly your own private lear jet
But you worked in a grocery store
Every day until you could afford to get away
So you went to Sweden to meet Ingmar Bergman
He wasn't there or he just didn't care
I think it's time for you, my friend
To stop pretending that you are a

Movie Star, Movie Star, ahahar
You think you are a movie
Movie Star, Movie Star, ahahar
You think you are a Movie Star, ahahar

The frozen hero!
Your words are zero
When your dreams had vanished into dark
Along the go that you don't want to know

Movie Star, Movie Star, ahahar
You think you are a movie
Movie Star, Movie Star, ahahar
You think you are a Movie Star, ahahar

Movie Star, Movie Star, ahahar
You think you are a movie
Movie Star, Movie Star, ahahar
You think you are a Movie Star, ahahar
Movie Star, Movie Star, ahahar
You think you are a movie
Movie Star, Movie Star, ahahar
You think you are a Movie Star, ahahar
You think you are a Movie Star, ahahar
You think you are a Movie Star, ahahar
You think you are a Movie Star, ahahar
