Haunted by the shadows of the past
A howling void in my mind
Through the halls of Kaer Morhen it echoes
A remnant of memories left behind
All I have are the swords on my back
I wander but my purpose is clear
White Wolf, Vatt'Ghern, Butcher they call me
I am the beast the beasts will fear

The flames of my eyes are set ablze
Like the silence that burns in my heart
I will not stray from the code of my order
Ride the Path

By steel, by silver
I slay like a wolf in the night
By steel, by silver
I slay, runes of power be my light
By steel, by silver
I slay like a wolf in the night
By steel, by silver
I slay, for the wolf is I

Solitude, my companion on the Path
Though I am shunned I am free
For the failings of civilization
Have proven more savage than any beast
As the fires of Novigrad roar
And the stakes of hypocrisy burn
I have felt the hammer of prejudice
Cast by humanity down from its throne

Fear the night
Silver light, be my guide

Ride out across the Termerian plains
Ride into bloodshed, forever be changed
Dark visions haunt me from cold cosmic realms
Winter eternally reigns
Clad in iron with hoods rimed in frost
Wielding black magicks from dark spheres beyond
Legions of spectres take flight in the sky
Winter eternally reigns
