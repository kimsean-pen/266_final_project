I'm running out of time
I hope that I can save you somehow
If I, if I had superpowers
I'd save the world and you would be mine, mine

Have no fear, your hero is here
My super sense is telling me that danger is near
I'm getting close to you so I can watch your back
A villain's on the loose and he is ready to attack

Oh, but I'm not a superhero
I'm not that kinda guy
But I can save you
Baby, give me a try

'Cause I'm running out of time
I know what I came to do
And I didn't come to lose
So I'll fight until you're mine
And if trouble comes around
I won't be backing down, tonight

Oh, if you're in danger
Oh, I'm here to save you
Oh, that's what I'm made of
Oh oh oh oh
Give you my superluv
Been fighting for your love for all this time
What I gotta do to make you mine
Got no super speed but I'm running this town

If you get in my way
Imma take you down
Oh, but I'm not a superhero
I'm not that kinda guy
But I can save you

Baby, give me a try
'Cause I'm running out of time
I know what I came to do
And I didn't come to lose

So I'll fight until you're mine
And if trouble comes around
I won't be backing down, tonight
Oh, if you're in danger
Oh, I'm here to save you
Oh, that's what I'm made of

Oh oh oh oh
Give you my superluv
Can't you see (That you're my lover)
We're meant to be (You're like no other)
So come with me, say you're mine
(Don't keep me waiting)
'Cause I'm running out of time
I know what I came to do

And I didn't come to lose
So I'll fight until you're mine
And if trouble comes around
I won't be backing down, tonight
Oh, if you're in danger
Oh, I'm here to save you

Oh, that's what I'm made of
Oh oh oh oh
Give you my superluv
Give you my superluv
Give you my superluv
Give you my superluv
Give you my superluv
And all you really need
Has been right in front of you this whole time
And I, I didn't need no superpowers
I saved the world and now you are mine
Now you're mine
