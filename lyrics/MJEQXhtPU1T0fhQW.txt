There's something that I need you to know
Just in case I never told you
No matter where I am, where I go
I'll always think of you as my angel

In the dark
Near or far
I close my eyes and there you are
Deep down inside
Inside my heart
I know you're here to protect me

I feel the way
The way that you love me
I feel your love
I feel it all over me
I feel the way
The way that you love me
I feel your love
All over me
I feel the way
The way that you love me
I feel your love
I feel it all over me
I feel the way
The way that you love me
I feel your love
All over me
(All over me)
(All over me)
(All over me)

I never meant to cause you no pain
If only I could change the last day
Since then I've been living in shame
I pray that heaven sends me an angel

In the dark
Near or far
I close my eyes and there you are
Deep down inside
Inside my heart
I know you're here to protect me

I feel the way
The way that you love me
I feel your love
I feel it all over me
I feel the way
The way that you love me
I feel your love
All over me
I feel the way
The way that you love me
I feel your love
I feel it all over me
I feel the way
The way that you love me
I feel your love
All over me
(All over me)
(All over me)
(All over me)

There's something that I need you to know
Just in case I never told you
No matter where I am, where I go
I'll always think of you as my angel

In the dark
Near or far
I close my eyes and there you are
Deep down inside
Inside my heart
I know you're here to protect me

I feel the way
The way that you love me
I feel your love
I feel it all over me
I feel the way
The way that you love me
I feel your love
All over me
I feel the way
The way that you love me
I feel your love
I feel it all over me
I feel the way
The way that you love me
I feel your love
All over me
(All over me)
(All over me)
(All over me)
