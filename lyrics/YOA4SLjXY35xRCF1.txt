I don't care what nobody says
We gonna have a baby
Taking off in a Coupe de Ville
She's bubbled up on AV

She don't care what her mama said, no
She's gonna have my baby
I'm taking all i have to take
This taking's gonna shake me

People call us renegade
Cause we like livin' crazy
We like taking on the town
Cause people's gettin' lazy

I don't care what nobody says, no
I wanna be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk
But I love her like no other

And the doc say say he don't know
I'm a ghost and I don't think if I know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go

Where we're gonna go
People call us renegades

Cause we like livin' crazy
We like taking on this town

Cause people's gettin' lazy
I don't care what nobody says, no
I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk
But I love her like no other
And her daddy say say he don't know
Where we're gonna go
I'm a ghost and I don't think if I know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're going
Ooh whoa oh, whoa, oh, oh
Ooh whoa oh, whoa, oh, oh
Ooh whoa oh, whoa, oh, oh

I don't care if you don't care
I don't care what nobody says
We gonna have a baby
Taking off in a Coupe de Ville
She bubbled up on AV
She don't care what her mama says, no
She gonna have my baby
I'm taking all I have to take
This takings gonna shave me
Whoa oh, whoa, oh, oh
