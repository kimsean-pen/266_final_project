How can I retake you when you turn your back on me
You let me alone in the darkest hour
The darkest hour
Is there a place where we could find, find our love again?
It's beaten and bruised but the only thing given to us

Powerless
Naked
On my knees
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out
Too much
Too soon
Too high on fire
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out

Forgive me
Forgive me
Let the tears fall down like rain

Forgive me
Forgive me
And I love you till the end

Fear casts the longest shadow
Turning your heart into glass
No, don't you move or we both will break

We can't go on In this thunderstorm
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out
No chance for us
We're too high on fire
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out
On fire
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out

Forgive me
Forgive me
Let the tears fall down like rain

Forgive me
Forgive me
And I love you till the end

We can't go on
A last kiss in the storm
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out
One day reborn
One star and one thorn

Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out

Let the tears fall down like rain

Forgive me
Forgive me
Let the tears fall down like rain

Forgive me
Forgive me
And I love you till the end
