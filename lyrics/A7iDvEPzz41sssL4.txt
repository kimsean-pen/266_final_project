Here it comes the joy of being alone
I'm such a child on my own
just a child on my own

'cause I know it's true and I see it's right
I know it's true and I see it's right

here it goes on happiness is home
here it goes on happiness is home
happiness is home
happiness is home

and I know it's not a dream
I don't want this to be sweet
I just know it's not a dream
I'm not gonna get sick of it

'cause I know it's true and I see it's right
I just know it's true and I see it's right

here it goes on happiness is home
here it goes on happiness is home
here it goes on happiness is home
here it goes on happiness is home
happiness is home, happiness is home

don't you say it (I would say)
don't you say it (you talked too soon)
don't you say it
and it's already late to get back, to go back...

here it goes on happiness is home
happiness is home, happiness is home
here it goes on happiness is home
happiness is home, happiness is home
happiness is home, happiness is home
here it goes on, here it goes on
here it goes on, goes on, goes on
is home
is home
happiness is back home and it's back home
