I am an island underneath the setting sun
In an ocean that is churning
For all I know there might be nobody nearby
Still, the world, it keeps on turning

And when that sun goes down
It gets brighter in my heart somehow
I don't know why this is
But it's what I want to know

Sometimes we start over
And go solo
We're looking for
That summer home
Beside the sea
And for the future

Since I left you I'm a gold balloon that wanders high
I won't sing through rainbows and showers
Taking lovers just might keep my tears at bay
But the dam will break at any hour

By candle-light you seem
To deepen in your mysteries
Confusing forces are moving me
At the tides of these seas

Sometimes we start over
And go solo
We're looking for
The ones we've hurt
Just to forgive us
In the future

Sometimes we start over
And go solo
No metaphors
Are needed from
This time onwards
In this-

Sooooong
Oooooooh
Aaaaaaah
Oooooooh

And when the sun goes down
It gets brighter in my heart somehow
I don't know why this is
But it's what I'd like to know

Sometimes we start over
And go solo
We're looking for
The ones we've hurt
Just to forgive us
In the future

Sometimes we start over
And just go solo
No metaphors
Are needed from
This time onwards
In this song
