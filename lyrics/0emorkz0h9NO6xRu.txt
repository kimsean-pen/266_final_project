Life is a paradise

Woah, whoa yeah

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight

I believe life could be paradise once again (again)
And the love we thought we lost is sleeping within
Close your eyes, it's something for you

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
I'm a prisoner of hope alone

We are young and we are old
We're falling like leaves (like leaves, like leaves)
And your heart's so full of soul it makes me believe
Once again, it's something for you

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight

A bridge over time is what you need
To see the light, to see the light
Woah yeah

Lucky love, lucky love
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Lucky love, lucky love
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Woah, woah, yeah

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight I've been there with you
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
I'm a prisoner of hope alone
