I don't understand why
Most of the time
I'm living my life all wrong
I felt nothing at all
The freedom of the fall
My smile is on the backseat, the back wall

Watch me as I go and separate
The ones that I am made to love and hate
And slowly counting down my body weight, I'm tired
I'm tired

I can do things
No human can do
I can doubt myself and then I'll doubt you
That's nothing new

Watch me as I go and separate
The ones that I am made to love and hate
And slowly counting down my body weight, I'm tired
Watch me as I go and separate
The ones that I am made to love and hate
And slowly counting down my body weight, I'm tired
I'm tired

And the stars, they look like little mice
To me, I am my only vice
Sat on a dead man's bench
The sun cools my neck
It covers my skin
The earth pulls me back
How 'bout that?

Watch me as I go and separate
The ones that I am made to love and hate
And slowly counting down my body weight
I'm tired
Watch me as I go and separate
The ones that I am made to love and hate
And slowly counting down my body weight
I'm tired
I'm tired
