Cry for the bird with broken wings
Cry for the world that will not spin
Cry for the loss of innocence
Cry for a love, turned loveless

Sometimes I think of you
Sometimes I think of you
Sometimes I think of you
When I'm alone, alone

Oh, cry, oh, cry
Oh, cry, cry, cry

Nothing will ever be the same
All is ruined and put to shame
Tears and stars are one and the same
When I look up through my focused lens

But sometimes I think of you
Sometimes I think of you
Sometimes I think of you
When I'm alone, alone

Oh, cry, oh cry
Tears and stars collide, confide then die
Deep inside, tears run dry
But I cry and cry and cry

Tiger skins and elephant tusks
In guilted mountains seep disgust
I look at you and I want to speak
For once in a while, be a man and weep

'Cause all the dolphins and whales have gone
All good tidings and hopes have blown
All our nightmares are flying home
And it's too late to do anything

But cry, oh, cry
Tears and stars collide, confide then die
Deep inside, tears run dry
But I cry, cry and cry

Oh, cry
Oh, cry
Cry, cry, cry
