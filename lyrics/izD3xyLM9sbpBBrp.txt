I am all you ever wanted
I'm a new dimension
Immortality perfected, phantomized
Expansion of life
Generation of light
Finding every deviation
Just to keep the future alive

Under a phantom divine
Touched by the light
In ambrosial grace
No applause for the old pantomime
In the shadows of our dreams
A phantom divine

I'm the face of the selected
I'm your chain reaction
I am mortally rejected
I am the empire connecting the mind
And I'll die just to keep you alive

Under a phantom divine
Touched by the light
In ambrosial grace
No applause for the old pantomime
In the shadows of our dreams
A phantom divine

Under a phantom divine
Touched by the light
In ambrosial grace
No applause for the old pantomime
In the shadows of our dreams
The phantom divine

There is still hope for you
I am the empire
All that you see is true
I am the empire
There is still hope for us
Under a phantom divine

Under a phantom divine
Touched by the light
In ambrosial grace
No applause for the old pantomime
Like impulses of our dreams
A phantom divine

Under the phantom divine
Touched by the light
In ambrosial grace
No applause for the old pantomime
In the shadows of our dreams
A phantom divine

I am the empire
I am the empire
I am the empire
I am the empire
