Old friend indeed, come built me up
Come share your light, it makes me shine
You get the message, don't you ever forget it
Let's laugh and cry, until we die!

If it wasn't for you, I'd be alone
If it wasn't for you, I'd have to hold my own
Don't wait til I do wrong
Don't wait til I put up a fight
You won my heart without a question
Don't wait for life

Hey, I care for you. I talk to you, in my deepest dreams. I'm fortunate
We got a friendship, no one can contest it
And not to mention, I respect you with my all!

If it wasn't for you, I'd be alone
If it wasn't for you, I have to hold my own
Don't wait til I do wrong
Don't wait til I put up a fight
You won my heart without a question
Don't wait for life

Not a thing in the world could get between what we share
No matter where you at, no worry I'll be there
No one's got your back like I do
Even when the business ain't going well, we still cool
When I shine, you shine, always on your side
All my life you'll have what's mine
Mark my word, we gon' be alright
My brother, my sister we gon' be just fine

Hey, If it wasn't for you, I'd be alone
Hey, If it wasn't for you, I'd be on my own
Don't wait til I do wrong
Don't wait til I put up a fight
You won my heart without a question
Don't wait for life
