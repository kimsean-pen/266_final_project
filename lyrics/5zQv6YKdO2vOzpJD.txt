I'm a rabbit in your headlights
Scared of the spotlight
You don't come to visit
I'm stuck on this bed

Thin rubber gloves
She laughs when she's crying
She cries when she's laughing
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away away away away

I'm a rabbit in your headlights
Christian suburbanite
Washed down the toilet
Money to burn
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away

Sample from Jacobs Ladder:

'If you're frightened of dying and then you hold on
You'll see devils tearing your life away
But, if you've made your peace
Then the devils are really angels
Freeing you from the Earth... from the Earth'

Root worms on the underground
Caught between stations
Butterfingers
I'm losing my patience
I'm a rabbit in your headlights
Christian suburbanite
You got money to burn
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away... away... away.
