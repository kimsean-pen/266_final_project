Love don't come so easily.
This doesn't have to end in tragedy.
I have you and you have me.
We're one and a million, why can't you see?

I'm waitin, waitin for nothin!
You're leavin, leavin me hangin!
When did your heart go missin?
When did your heart go missin?

I treat you, alike a princess
But your life is just a-one big mess.
When did your heart go missin?
When did your heart go missin?
Yeah...

I meant every word I said.
I never was lying when we talked in bed.
I'm retracing every step in my head.
What did I miss back then now we're so, so misled

I'm waitin, waitin for nothin!
You're leavin, leavin me hangin!
When did your heart go missin?
When did your heart go missin?

I treat you, alike a princess
But your life is just a-one big mess.
When did your heart go missin?
When did your heart go missin?

I don't understand.
How could you forget?
What we had
Is so wrong.

I'm waitin, waitin for nothin!
You're leavin, leavin me hangin!
When did your heart go missin?
When did your heart go missin?

I treat you, alike a princess
But your life is just a-one big mess.
When did your heart go missin?
When did your heart go missin?
Yeah...

(talking)
Things were so good.
We had a little dream,
A little dream together.
Buy a house, settle down.
Do our thing,
But you dissappeared on me.
And your heart,
Your heart went missin.
I don't know how to find it, I don't know where it is.
I don't know where your heart went.
It was here just the other day, now it's gone.
I'm going to call the police...
Call the investigator, the heart investigator of teens.
