On the brink of losing my voice
I just want to make a sound
I don't wanna feel so alone
But I do when you're not around
Off the sympathy makes it easy
Easy to forget
Forgive, forget where you came from
Cause our memories have a breath
Cause our memories are a threat
Cause our memories have a breath
Cause our memories are a threat

Every moment awake I bite
More than I can chew
Give my eyes a bit of your sun
To look in to why I left the noon
On the brink of losing my voice
I keep tripping of over your steps
Everything is hard to when our memories are a threat
Cause our memories have a breath
Cause our memories are a threat
Cause our memories have a breath
Cause our memories are a threat
