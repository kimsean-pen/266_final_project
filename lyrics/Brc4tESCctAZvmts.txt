let's go gaze at stars
tell me which one shines the most
and even if we're far
let's look at the same star that shines and glows

tell me what you see
and i'll tell you where i'll be
you say we'll make it work
no matter how much the distance hurts

and i'll send you letters from miles away
i'll make sure that it gets to you
and you'll send me letter from miles away
and i promise that we'll make it through

i wanna hold your hand
but i can't from where i am
you're the one i really miss
but for now we gotta deal with this shit
