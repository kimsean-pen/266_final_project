despite that he saw blatant similarity
he struggled to find a distinctive moiety
all he found was vulgar superficiality
but he focused it to sharpness
and shared it with the others
it signified his anger and his misery

them and us
lobbying determined through a mire of disbelievers
them and us
dire perpetuation and incongruous insistence
that there really is a difference
between them and us

hate is a simple manifestation
of the deep seated self directed frustration
all it does is promote fear and constrenation
it's the inability
to justify the enemy
and it fills us all with trepidation

them and us
bending the significance to match a whimsied fable
them and us
tumult for the ignorant and purpose for the violence

a confused loose alliance forming
them and us

and I heard him say
we can take them all (we can take them all)
We can take them all, thats what he said
we can take them all
but he didn't know who we were
and he didn't know who they were.
and there wasn't any reason or
motive, or value, to his story,
just allegory, imitation glory,
and a desperate feeble search for a friend

them and us
lobbying determined through a mire of disbelievers

them and us
dire perpetuation and incongruous insistence

tumult for the ignorant and purpose for the violence

a confused loose alliance forming
them and us

we can take them all (we can take them all)
