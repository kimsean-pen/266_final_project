Like the way it sounds, Fraudy?
Uh, yeah, yeah
Just let me breathe for a minute, man
Just let me breathe
Just let me breathe for a minute, man
(You already know it's me, man)
Just let me breathe for a minute
(You already know it's me)
Just let me breathe

It's too hot, drop the top off the wagon
Lay back, blowing fire like dragon (Poof!)
Man, I'm flying past Saturn (Uh)
Fuck outta here like I ain't that savage
(No, no, no, no)
Two uzis and a rifle
It's like I'm at the studio with Michael
(Michael Jackson)
You can hear me dancing on the beat
Bam Bam 'bout to put a mansion on the beach, uh
Hundred Latins in your lobby
That's what happens when you fuck around with Body, uh
And I put that on my mami (It's on my mami)
I would never give my heart to a thotty
If I could just make a dance that goes with this song
Then I'ma be on
Basic bitches gon' dance to it (everywhere)
Basic bitches everywhere gon' dance to it (everywhere)

Just let me breathe for a minute
Just let me breathe for a minute, uh
Just let me breathe for a minute
White Range Rover, blowing trees all in it
Just let me breathe for a minute
Just let me breathe for a minute, man
Just let me breathe for a minute
White Range Rover, blowing trees all in it

You got a fat ass, baby, shake that shit
Shake that shit
Shake that shit
You got a fat ass, baby, shake that shit
Shake that shit
Shake it

I got two shows, I'm about to pitch another
Throwing alley oops to my brothers (Curry!)
We all shine, nobody victims
Armani sweatsuit pimping
Black Pippens
I swag different
That's why the money in the bag different (different)
Come up short, you'll have your motherfucking fam missing
I lay on beaches and swerve in whips
You ain't serving shit, you just an urban myth
Every day get fleek
Riding around Queens on a jetski, it's me (You know it's me!)
Every day get high
'Til the day I die
Every day get high
Man I roll that shit
And I smoke that shit
Honey bouncing up and down
She nearly broke my dick (my dick)
She nearly broke my dick (my dick, my dick)

Just let me breathe for a minute
Just let me breathe for a minute, uh
Just let me breathe for a minute
White Range Rover, blowing trees all in it
Just let me breathe for a minute
Just let me breathe for a minute, man
Just let me breathe for a minute
White Range Rover, blowing trees all in it
