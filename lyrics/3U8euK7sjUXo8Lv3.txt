I'm looking for a Miracle Man
That tells me no lies
I'm looking for a Miracle Man
Who's not in disguise

I don't know where he'll come from
And I don't know where he's been
But it's not our Jimmy sinner
Because he's so obscene

Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted

Today I saw a Miracle Man
On TV cryin'
Such a hypocritical man
Born again
Dyin'

He don't know where he's goin'
But we notice where he's been
It was our little Jimmy sinner on the screen

Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man...

A Devil with a crucifix
Brimstone and fire
He needs another carnal fix
To take him higher and higher

Now Jimmy he got busted
With his pants down
Repent ye wretched sinners
Self righteous clown
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
