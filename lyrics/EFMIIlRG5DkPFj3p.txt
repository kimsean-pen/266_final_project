I wish I could stand on a star
I wish I could be where you are
They say, "don't you ever give up"
It's so hard to be somethin' when you're not

But I have walked alone with the stars in the moonlit night
I have walked alone, no one by my side
Now I walk with you with my head held high
In the darkest sky, I feel so alive

Adrift a lonely, little cloud
Above ground where I stand so proud
My face glowing loudly through the crowd
As I walk with the beauty of the night

But I have walked alone with the stars in the moonlit night
I have walked alone, no one by my side
Now I walk with you with my head held high
In the darkest sky, I feel so alive

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

But I have walked alone with the stars in the moonlit night
I have walked alone, no one by my side
Now I walk with you with my head held high
In the darkest sky, I feel so alive
