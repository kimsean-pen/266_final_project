He wandered on fine old paths
He wandered along high ridges
He wandered towards the heart of Midgard
He wandered until he saw a mountain

Over a bridge wet with dew he walked
Through the golden gate of Asgard
He saw the vigorous gardens of gods
Crowned around the father of All's high castle

'O father of all, I Ganglere ask:
How have we all come to existence and where do we end?
Answer, O high, even high and third
what is mankind and the race of gods' faith?'

Gylfaginning, deception for he who was wrongly taught
But not for the one who knows Gylfaginning
Grimnes revelation
