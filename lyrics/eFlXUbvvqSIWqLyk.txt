Someones in cold storage
seeking heinz main-courses
craving for a raw love

He'll hide you from the cleaver
he'll hang with you forever
longing for a fresh meat

By or by crook
you'll be first in his book
for an impaled affair

By or by crook
you'll be last in his book
of flesh, oh so rare

Be a carcass
Be a dead pork
Be limblessly in love
Be a carcass
Be a dead pork
Be limblessly in love

Someones left in cold storage
thawed in heinz main-courses
carving for a new tin
He got you with the cleaver
he hung you up forever
anticipating new skin

Out of the frying pan
and into the fire
58th variety

Out of the frying pan
and into the fire
mother had her son for tea

Be a carcass
Be a dead pork
Be limblessly in love
Be a carcass
Be a dead pork
Be limblessly in love

In love with the pain
In love with the bleeding
In love with the pain
that you once felt
as you became a carcass
we became a carcass
Carcass
you became a carcass
Carcass
you became a carcass
In love with the stumps
In love with the bleeding
In love with the pain
that you now feel
as you became a carcass
We became a carcass
Carcass
Get him in, but don't whine you swine
Carcass
You became a carcass.
