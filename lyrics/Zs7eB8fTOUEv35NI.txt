Decide
It's now the time to make up your mind
Today's the day you'll hopefully find that freedom is granted
Our sentence has passed and now we are floating towards the light

And as I fall I rue my mistakes and my soul fade
I want to be where our dreams first met tonight
And as I fall into the sea the waves consume me
I want to be where our dreams first met
We wore our hearts around our necks

Here I lay under the sun that burns my wings
Our dreams are broken for all of our faith has been taken away
Take me to the sun far and far beyond the clouds
Forever captured in your mind
When you look to the sky I'm in your eyes

And one day I'll take you there
To the point on the map where the sea meets the sky
(The sky)

Bring me the sun, the light, trough the rain
I made a pact, the promise was set
Our efforts will not be in vain

And as I fall into the sea the waves consume
I want to be where our dreams first met
We wore our hearts around our necks

If I gave you a chance would you open your arms wide?
If I gave you a chance would you open your arms wide?
If I gave you a chance would you open your arms wide?

Here I lay under the sun that burns my wings
Our dreams are broken for all of our faith has been taken away
Take me to the sky and far beyond the clouds
Forever captured in your mind
When you look to the sky I'm in your eyes
