When we were lost
We found each other
And headed sightless for the sea.
We had no way
Misfit and stray
Living beyond both muse and pity.
And I know you feel isolated
And I feel what you won't say
I don't care if the disbelievers
Don't understand, you're my pretty boy, always.
I felt no pain
When you changed your name
We were each other's only family.
Walking away
Would change the way

And I know you feel isolated
And I feel what you won't say
I don't care if the disbelievers
Don't understand, you're my pretty boy, always.
And I know you feel isolated
And I feel what you won't say
I don't care if the disbelievers don't understand
You're my pretty boy.
And I know you feel isolated
And I feel what you won't say
I don't care if the disbelievers don't understand
You're my pretty boy, always.
Always.
