Blank faces
Here we are staring at these
Blank pages
How did the plans we drew
Disappear in thin air
Now all that's left are
Two blank faces
I know we let gold fade to black
Give me time enough to bring us back

Cause I've been pouring my whole life in you
Trying to resurrect the love we grew
Yeah, we're both confused
But I'll keep pouring my whole life into
These broken roots

Frustrated
We feel the cracks within our
Foundation
That's why I'm digging every
Day and night
Night and day
Swear I won't stop
So please keep waiting

Cause I've been pouring my whole life in you
Trying to resurrect the love we grew
Yeah, we're both confused
But I'll keep pouring my whole life into
These broken roots

I keep pouring my whole life in you
Trying to resurrect the love we grew
Yeah, we're both confused
But I'll keep pouring my whole life into
These broken roots
