Deep in the tundra under hyperborean skies
The vile necromancer reaps from genocide
One warrior lives, his mind is burning as they fall
He will not rest until he has avenged them all

Hail! From the wastes of they North he rides
Hail! Crushing the earth with every stride

Tale of blood and might
Mammoth rider through the night
Ancient warrior
The spear of destiny
Eyes full of hate
Gored upon the lusks of fate
Fight against the gods
The mammoth rider comes

Armed with a spear whose blade was forged from meteors
Tempered in the blood of a thousand conquerors
Heart filled with hatred for the murder of his tribe
Against the sorcerer the mammoth warrior rides

Hail! From the wastes of they North he rides
Hail! Pounds at the earth like a battle-drum

Tale of blood and might
Mammoth rider through the night
Ancient warrior
The spear of destiny
Eyes full of hate
Gored upon the lusks of fate
Fight against the gods
The mammoth rider comes

"Your feeble flesh bends to my will!
I've seen your future in my crystal ball
Your beast of war won't save your skin
In shrouded magicks I've forseen your fall
Your end is nigh!"

He rides out from the mountains with vengeance in his eyes
Across the rivers and valleys to where the ocean meets the skies
Against th sorcerer's army he raises his spear and shield
And calls upon his people's gods to bring him victory on the battlefield

And he rides to meet his fate

Evil magicks rend the sky
Bow to the wizard
Ancient, twisted necromancy
Spells of death

Tale of blood and might
Mammoth rider through the night
Ancient warrior
The spear of destiny
Eyes full of hate
Gored upon the lusks of fate
Fight against the gods
The mammoth rider comes
