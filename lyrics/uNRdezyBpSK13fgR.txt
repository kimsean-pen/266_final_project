My love I am the speed of sound
I left them motherless, fatherless
Their souls dangling inside-out from their mouths
But it's never enough
I want you

Carved your name across three counties
Ground it in with bloody hides
Their broken necks will lie in the ditch
'till you "Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop this madness!"
I want you

I have waited with a glacier's patience
Smashed every transformer with every trailer
'till nothing was standing
65 miles wide

But still you are nowhere, still you are nowhere
Nowhere in sight
Come out to meet me, run out to meet me
Come into the light

Climb the boxcars to the engine
Through the smoke and to the sky

Your rails have always outrun mine so I
Picked them up and crashed them down
In a moment close to now
'cause I miss, I miss,
I miss, I miss,
I miss, I miss,
I miss, I miss
How you'd sigh yourself to sleep
When I'd rake the springtime across your sheets

My love I am the speed of sound
I left them motherless, fatherless
Their souls dangling inside-out from their mouths
But it's never enough

My love, I'm an owl on the sill in the evening
But morning finds you
Still warm and breathing

This tornado loves you
This tornado loves you
This tornado loves you
This tornado loves you
This tornado loves you
What will make you believe me?

This tornado loves you
This tornado loves you
This tornado loves you
This tornado loves you
This tornado loves you
What will make you believe me?
