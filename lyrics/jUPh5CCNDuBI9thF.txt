Well you don't know I'm living to die so young
Well you don't know I'm killing my self for fun
Well you don't know I'm running to slow it down
Well you don't know I'm giving my dreams to the ground

I've been left with two cigarettes
One for my life and one for my death
Guess it's time to pass away
Why am l here?
I think I should not stay

If there's no peace what's the point to live?
Isn't it great to jump off the cliff?
I don't mind, but you got the word
Live your life until you get bored

Haunted in night time
I know that it's silly
You're always scared with your thoughts on your own
The cigarette's burnt out
And you gonna leave me
I always thought you would take me from home

Haunted in night time
I know that it's silly
The cigarette's burnt out
And you gonna leave me
I always thought you would take me from home
