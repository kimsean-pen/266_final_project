I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love honey
I just want you to feel fine

I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine

Finally baby
The truth has come down now
Take a listen to your spirit
It's crying out loud
Tryin' to believe
Oh you say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
Oh, oh yeah
Uh-huh

I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine

I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine

Finally baby
The truth has been told
Now you tell me that I'm crazy
It's nothing that I didn't know
Trying to survive
Oh you say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
Hey I want you
Oh, oh yeah
Uh-huh

I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love honey
Yeah, take a little time

Oh I don't want to know
