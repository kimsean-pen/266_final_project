I don't feel OK with you
You know what you've done but you keep coming back
Force it on the weak ones who
Keep letting you do what you do

I'm your piñata
Crack me open like you always do
Say you're only bringing the best out of me
But you break me, yeah
You break me, yeah

I don't need a second clue
I know what they want if they keep coming back
I usually know what to do
This time I let him hang me up

I'm your piñata
Crack me open like you always do
Say you're only bringing the best out of me
But you break me, yeah
You break me

I'm your piñata
Crack me open like you always do
I'm your piñata
Crack me open like you always do

But you break me
Yeah you break me
I'm your piñata
Crack me open like you always do
