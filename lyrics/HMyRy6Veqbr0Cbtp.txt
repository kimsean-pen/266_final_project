Clouds float away like iron tools on the moon
All my time is in half life
Memories over memories
Can I see more than I'm programmed to be

Constellation of orion
A picture with a past
A future so vast
A mnemonic game
On the arc of a journey

I report
There once were cities
Open academies
Avenues and tree
Human law
Automatic oracles
Calender, the years
Verbal hemispheres

Constellation of orion
The repositioned light
The post atomic night
Informing me I'm near
The axis of feeling

Constellation of orion
A picture with a past
A future so vast
A mnemonic game
On the arc of a journey
