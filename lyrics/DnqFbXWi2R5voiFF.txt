She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction

From Chicago to Toronto
She's the one that they call old whatsername
She's the symbol of resistance
And she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade

Is she dreaming what I'm thinking
Is she the mother of all bombs gonna detonate
Is she trouble like I'm trouble
Make it a double twist of fate or a melody that

She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define

Well, nothing comes to mind

She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define

Well, nothing comes to mind

She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction

She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction

She's a rebel, she's a rebel
She's a rebel and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, she's a rebel
She's a rebel and she's dangerous
