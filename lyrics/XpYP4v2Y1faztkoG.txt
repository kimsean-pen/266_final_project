I think of you
As I think of myself
I look from where I stand
And see deep water below
Are you there
Or are you somewhere else
I've wondered where
Ever since then

Won't you take me back there again
I dreamt of drowning
But it never was as good as when
You took me down and under

I could have told you
The same thing yesterday
But I could not find
The words I wanted to say
You never listened to me anyway
I've wondered why
Ever since then

Won't you take me back there again
I dreamt of drowning
But it never was as good as when
You took me down and under

Won't you take me back there again
I dreamt of drowning
But it never was as good as when
You took me down and under

Why can't we go back there now
You could take my hand
And we could go back like before
I'd like to go down there once more
