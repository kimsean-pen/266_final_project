You're falling at your feet
Giving everything up
There's something in the way
Love is never enough
I see your sorry how
I'm burning down the gun
With a war in your mind
That never wants to be won

I catch you in a light
No one else can see
I know you see her
And you'll never see me
She makes you feel the most

Keep your souls alive

But what we had
It never really died

And this is what I'll say
If I had any words

Wish we hadn't messed up
Now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love

Wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine
But you gave it away

And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else
Just to know your worth
But here's to us

Here's to us
Here's to us
Yeah, this is just a phase
Pretty sure of that
And one day, you and I
We will never look back
You kept me in the flames
But the fire was out
The fire was out
The fire was out
And this is what I'll say
If I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up
Now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love
Wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine
But you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else
Just to know your worth

And this is what I'll say
If I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up
Now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love
Wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine
But you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else
Just to know your worth
But here's to us
Here's to us
Here's to us
