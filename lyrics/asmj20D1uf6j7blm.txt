I never was the kind of girl
That's naturally sure when it comes to love, oh no
I was insecure, insecure

But when it comes to you and me
I can't deny this feeling inside
Oh no, I never felt like this before
This before, no, no, no

I'm seeing all the signs from above
I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of his Love
Oh yeah
I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
'Cause honey I was born to be his

I was made for loving him
The Fashion of his Love (I love you)
You know that I'd never cheat on a man
'Cause I'm not like that
I'm physically crafted to be
As fitting as McQueen

But when it comes to clothing I'm bad
I'm fashionably just designed to be grand
Oh and he's no accessory to me
-ry to me, no no, no

No I just can't seem to forget you
No I can't
For just as long as I met you
You're my babe right through

I was made for you (I was made for you)
I'm seeing all the signs from above
I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him

The Fashion of his Love
Oh yeah
I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
'Cause honey I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of his Love
They say I need a strong man

Not just a friend
But baby my search is done
No longer reason to cry or to justify
How I feel for you
My love
I'm seeing all the signs from above

I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
Oh yeah
I'm seeing all the signs from above

I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of his Love
Oh yeah
I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
'Cause honey I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of his Love
Oh yeah
I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
'Cause honey I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of his Love
Oh yeah
