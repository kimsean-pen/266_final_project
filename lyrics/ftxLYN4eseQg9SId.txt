I'm alive
I'm alive
Watch yourself
I'm taking over
The cracks in the pavement won't break my stride
I tread lightly
I tread light
I'm alive

I can't believe what I've become
I won't stop breathing
Your world is falling at your feet
I won't stop breathing

Oh my god
Yeah

I can't believe what I've become
I won't stop breathing
Your world is falling at your feet
I won't stop breathing

Just 'cause you're breathing don't mean you're alive
Excuses are useless when your mouth's stapled shut

I can't believe
What you've become
I can't believe

I can't believe
What you've become
I can't believe

You're drowning in the back room
So this is what it feels to waltz?

You're drowning in the back room
So this is what it feels to waltz?

You're drowning in the back room
So this is what it feels to waltz?

You're drowning in the back room
So this is what it feels to waltz?

What it feels to waltz!

I must be dreaming
Demise is so surreal
I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming
