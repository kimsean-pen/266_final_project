You try hard to see but I'm lying
On the outside
Give me one last chance to see it
I'm in the right mind

Act so tough, make you prove
Don't be afraid to see it through
And I'm not scared to take your place
It's not your fault
and that's okay

Easier said than done
I heard you right the first time
Easier said than done
I heard you right the first time

Trying to ride by our cabin
It's in my head
Should have just stayed home when I'd rather
Be alone instead

You're getting old
So act your age
It isn't fun
To make the same mistakes
So give it up, it's getting late
Make those moves
I'm not afraid

Easier said than done
I heard you right the first time
Easier said than done
I heard you right the first time
