You're the beach on Christmas Eve
Wrong place, good time, consistently
I feel like a walking love song
When you do me like that can you tell my brain turns off?

My favorite set of stairs is the one up to your room
And my heavy set of cares evaporates all around you
Evil comes in pairs and we like what we do
You've got me feeling like a walking love song

I must've caught you from 11:11
My lucky number seven
I try to hide with my words
But you just find me clever
I found a million places
You'd be worth the chases to go-oh-oh

From 7-Elevens to California Heavens
I try to hide with my words
But you just find me clever
I found a million places
You'd be worth the chases to go-oh-oh

Click your heels, I'll take you home
I found your slipper in the cold
I feel like a played-out love song
Since when's it hurt so bad?
Can you help me turn this off?

My favorite set of stairs is the one up to your room
And my heavy set of cares evaporates all around you
Evil comes in pairs and we like what we do
You've got me feeling like a walking love song

I must've caught you from 11:11
The lucky number seven
I try to hide with my words
But you just find me clever
I found a million places
You'd be worth the chases to go-oh-oh

From 7-Elevens to California Heavens
I try to hide with my words
But you just find me clever
I found a million places
You'd be worth the chases to go-oh-oh
To go-oh-oh

Let's tangle our legs again
The world doesn't need us to leave our heads
Let's tie our breath in knots again
Nothing's complicated if we pretend

My favorite set of stairs is the one up to your room
And my empty set of cares evaporates all around you
My favorite time to stare's when my eyes are on you
You've got me feeling like a walking love song

I must've caught you from 11:11
The lucky number seven
I try to hide with my words
But you just find me clever
I found a million places
You'd be worth the chases to go-oh-oh

From 7-Elevens to California Heavens
I try to hide with my words
But you just find me clever
I found a million places
You'd be worth the chases to go-oh-oh
To go-oh-oh, go-oh-oh, go-oh-oh

My favorite set of stairs is the one up to your room
And my empty set of cares evaporates all around you
Evil comes in pairs and we like what we do
You've got me feeling like a walking love song
