Come gather round the fire
I'll tell you all a tale
The day she came to power our lives forever changed
Never before a darkness like this have we seen
No end to suffering
All hail our mighty Queen

There's no hiding from her
She sees everything
Rules with the iron fist you know she is
The Matriarch!
She'll eat your heart!

I've heard it said that she can melt you with her eyes
And out her fingers spits a burning liquid fire
Without a single word you'll fall under her spell
And rip yourself apart with your bare hands while marching to her bell

There's no rising above
She drowns everything
Freedom doesn't exist you can't resist
The Matriarch!
You won't get far!

Oh, she brings nightmares to life
The foul most twisted kind
And when you beg to die
She glorifies

The Matriarch!
The Matriarch!
