God
So each day would be new I build you to sleep
That's the idea of dying but you'll just have to see
You can do what you want or so you think
But till you stop all your thoughts
You are tied to your surroundings
When the fog spreads out in the rainy season
It comes from my insides
When the thunderous lightning strikes down
You're seeing your real I
People
You blaspheme my name
But still I love you
Still I love you
I love you just the same
I hear all your prayers because I'm each one of you
Creation's not something I did
It's something that I do
The reason for the bad is so the there'd be such things as good
Oh I'd do anything for you
You all know I would
Be for me
Be for me
Be for me
Before for me
Before for me
Before for me
You know that I try to repair and repay
As life goes by a thousand times
It gets a little better
All is belief, All is belief, All is belief, All is belief
