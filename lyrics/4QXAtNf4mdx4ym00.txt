Love spreads her arms, waits there for the nails
I forgive you, boy, I will prevail
Too much to take, come cross to bear
I'm hiding in the trees with a picnic, she's over there, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

She didn't scream, she didn't make a sound
I forgive you boy, but don't leave town
Cold black skin, naked in the rain
Hammer flash in the lightning, they're hurting her again

Let me put you in the picture, let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister, ain't no king man, she's my queen
Let me put you in the picture, let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister, ain't no king man, she's my queen
I have a dream, I've seen the light
Don't put it out, she's alright, she's my sister

She didn't scream, she didn't make a sound
I forgive you boy, but don't leave town
Cold black skin, naked in the rain
Hammer flash in the lightning, they're hurting her again
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Let me put you in the picture, let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister, ain't no king man, she's my queen
Let me put you in the picture, let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister, ain't no king man, she's my queen
Let me put you in the picture, let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister, ain't no king man, she's my queen
Let me put you in the picture, let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister, ain't no king man, she's my queen
Let me put you in the picture, let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister, ain't no king man, she's my queen
Let me put you in the picture, let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister, ain't no king man, she's my queen
Let me put you in the picture, let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister, ain't no king man, she's my queen
I had a dream, I've seen the light
Don't put it out, say she's alright, yea, she's my sister
