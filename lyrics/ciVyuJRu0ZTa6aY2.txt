True friends lie underneath
These witty words I don't believe
I can't believe a damn thing they say anymore
Lie! lie! Liar!

liar you'll pay for your sins
So tell me how does it feel
How does it feel to be like you?
I think your mouth should be quiet
'Cause it never tells the truth now
So tell me, so tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?

Why can't things ever change?
I'm falling over and over again
From all the words that you have said
It's written on my heart for everyone to see
From the place I was, to the place I am, to the place I want to be

From the mountains I've been climbing over and under and over
So tell me how does it feel

How does it feel to be like you?
I think your mouth should be quiet

So tell me, so tell me why

Why does it have to be this way?
Why can't things ever change?

So come down now, come down from your tower now

Come down, come down from your tower
Come down, come down, come down from your tower, oh, oh
Come down, come down from your tower, oh, oh
Come down, come down from your tower, oh, oh
Come down, come down from your tower, oh, oh
Come down, come down from your tower
