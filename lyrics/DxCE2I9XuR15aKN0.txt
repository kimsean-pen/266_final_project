When you were young
And your excitement showed
But as time goes by
Does it outgrow?

Is that the way things go?
Forever reaching for the goal
Forever fading black
Comes a glow

Walking free (Woah)
Come with me (Woah)
Far away (Woah)
Every day (Woah)
Walking free (Woah)
Come with me (Woah)
Far away (Woah)
Every day (Woah)

When you were young
You never knew which way to go
What was once gray
No undertones

Well, every day do what you can
If you let them turn you round
Whatever goes up
Must come down

Walking free (Woah)
Come with me (Woah)
Far away (Woah)
Every day (Woah)
Walking free (Woah)
Come with me (Woah)
Far away (Woah)
Every day (Woah)
