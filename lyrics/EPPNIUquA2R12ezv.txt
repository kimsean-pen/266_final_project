Here we stand in silence,
Dreaming plans that could not fail.
You try to hide your face, yeah,
Stood beside the wall.

Still I can't escape from joy,
Time is running out,
Do you feel falling snow?

Nineteen-eighty five,
My glass made face forced to portray
These winter's lies, your wishful dream.
The hopes and cries, the better days.

Wipe the dust away from me,
I'll steal a snowflake for you.
Touching windowpane,
Who cares what's behind?

Do you know how far sun has gone?
So will you please complete me?
Dreams and snow collide
To the music in this room.
Please hold on, hold on, today,
Storm won't pass, snow on Rome won't let you cry,
Deeper into white, in the open space of dusk.

You try to hide your face,
Draming plans that could not fail.
I can't escape from joy,
My glass made face forced to portray.

Hold on, hold on.
Please hold on, hold on, today.
Hold on, hold on.
Please hold on, hold on, today.

Trying to get sleep, there is no relief.
No one to blame, no one to forgive.
I wanna feel sunlight on my lips,
Trying to get sleep, there is no relief.
No one to blame, no one to forgive.
I wanna feel sunlight on my lips,
Trying to get sleep, there is no relief...
