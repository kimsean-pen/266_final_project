(feat. Druski)

You had my heart, but didn't love it
I gave you every piece of me to [?]
You had my soul, we had it coming
Till you sold it for a dream that wasn't finished.

Heaven know that we don't care
Heaven know she can't come here
Heaven, show me love's not dead
[?]

I broke all the walls for you
I burn them for you to win!
I should just let you lose
And maybe you would have stayed
[?]
I do it again!
I will do it again!

I broke all the walls for you
I burned them for you to win!
I put my heart in you
Without a doubt, a second guess.

Heaven know that we don't care
Heaven know she can't come here
Heaven, show me love's not dead
[?]

I broke all the walls for you
I burned them for you to win!
I should just let you lose
And maybe you would have stayed forever
[?]
I do it again!
I will do it again!
