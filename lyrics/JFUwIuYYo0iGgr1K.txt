Smokin blunts on the comedown, why?
Just to get back up now, life
Get's me down when I just can't, fight
The pain of everything I keep in-side
Self-hate and I can't control
My emotions when I lose control
Wanna die, but I don't wanna die
Wanna try, but I don't wanna try
Live my life, I don't need to lie
I be inside by myself every night
With the glass on my dresser, I could never get enough
I been drinking too much and I know it's fucked up
Smokin' so much and I know I'm fucked up
But everybody that around tell me things are switching up
Nah, Nah, not me lil bitch,
bitch it's OmenXIII fuck your team lil bitch

Smokin blunts on the comedown, why?
Just to get back up now, life
Smokin blunts on the comedown, why?
Just to get back up now, life
Smokin blunts on the comedown, why?
Just to get back up now, life
Smokin blunts on the comedown, why?
Just to get back up now
