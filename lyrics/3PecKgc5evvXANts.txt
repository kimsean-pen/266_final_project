Are the chemicals controlled
Are they written in my native tongue
Open-ended cosmic code
I know I can't be the only one

Cause I felt vibrations across a burgundy sea
Now I bet my head on a mission I couldn't lead

But maybe there's a moon inside these lines
Habitable, and chosen
Maybe there's a home behind these eyes
Waiting until my logic falters and I'm losing hope
Who knows
Who knows

Cause I felt vibrations across a burgundy sea
Now I bet my head on a mission I couldn't lead

But maybe there's a moon inside these lines
Habitable, and chosen
Maybe there's a home behind these eyes
Waiting until my logic falters and I'm losing hope
Who knows
Who knows?
