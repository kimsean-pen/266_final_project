The news came, I was far away
That you were sick
Oh my, my, it was Mothers Day
With tears running down my face
You said boy, don't be scared
Just be brave

So low, so high
That's the way of this life
It's tempestuous at times
So low, so high
Oh, mother dear
I'm smiling by your side

And you lost your hair
And you were beautiful despite your big old ears
And you pushed right on through
Yeah, you're a tough old bird
That's the God's honest truth, oh

So low, so high
That's the way of this life
It's tempestuous at times

So low, so high
Oh, mother dear
I'm smiling by your side

So low, so high
That's the way of this life
It's tempestuous at times

So low, so high
Oh, mother dear
I'm smiling by your side
