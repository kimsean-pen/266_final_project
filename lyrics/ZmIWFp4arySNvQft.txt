The light of our lives burns down
Waiting for hours and hours
Our hunger is just a hum
Another distraction, another distraction
But in your arms
I feel lost and torn

Call to a silent room
The answer comes so crystal
It's not like you need to learn
We're tied to each other, tied to each other

In your arms
I feel lost and torn

In your arms
I feel a stranger faith
Forget the countless ways
I am so alien, a prisoner in skin
Our bodies break like glass
And shatter all our fears
I want to know you then
When heaven disappears
Heaven disappears

Tears in your heart remain, oh-oh, oh-oh
And nothing I do could ever undo
But I want to stay halfway the same

In your arms
I feel lost and torn

In your arms
I feel a stranger faith
Forget the countless ways
I am so alien, a prisoner in skin
Our bodies break like glass
And shatter all our fears
I want to know you then
When heaven disappears
Heaven disappears

Now I fear you're drifting beyond me
The words I say don't say
The touch is what I need
You take my youth away
And leave me with no need, and leave me with no need

When I leave you, I can't leave you
Part of me remains
In the garret above, it was never enough, never enough
When I leave you, I can't leave you
Part of me remains
In the garret above, it was never enough, never enough
