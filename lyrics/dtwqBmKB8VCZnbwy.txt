You arrived
In my dream
Beside me every night
You and me

We explode
Through the scene
We try to drain the night
Empty

No one ever goes off in every way
Like you do

We got together
We weaved our web
Tangled in the waves whit you
We expected to see red

We both erupt in colors
And carve out our names
You keep me aroused
I know you feel the same

You arrived
In my dream
Beside me every night
Just you and me

We explode
Through the scene
We try to drain the night
Empty

No one else has a hold over me
Like you do

You open up the covers
You lure me in
Tackle me anxious
Back into bed

Where I hope to
Discover all of your ways
This place is death
I know you feel the same

You arrived
In my dream
Beside me every night
Just you and me

We explode
Through the scene
We try to drink the night
In every way
