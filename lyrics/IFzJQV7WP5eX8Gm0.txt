When I feel you dreaming
I think of sunsets
How high my high gets

I wanna give to you an everlasting love
I fill your life with a satisfying love
All you need is an everlasting love
All you want is a satisfying love

Sun breezes, moonlight teases
Friendly invasion
Late night persuasion

I wanna give to you an everlasting love
I fill your life with a satisfying love
All you need is an everlasting love
All you want is a mystifying love

Each time you pass me by
You saw me fade away
I'll give you more each day

I'll give you everlasting love
I fill your life with a satisfying love
All you need is an everlasting love
All you want is a mystifying love

I wanna give to you an everlasting love
Wanna fill your life with a satisfying love
All you need is an everlasting love
All you want is a mystifying love

I wanna give to you an everlasting love
Wanna fill your life with a satisfying love
All you need is an everlasting love
All you want is a mystifying love

I wanna give to you an everlasting love
I wanna fill your life with a satisfying love
All you need is an everlasting love
All you want is a mystifying love
