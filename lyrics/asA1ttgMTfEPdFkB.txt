I caught you in the dog house
Drinking coffee with your new wife
How is your new life swiping through headlines?
How do you find the time?
You two look very nice (very nice)
Silver in your eyes
The sin that's committed
Red and open wide
Of life in the wild
You're looking very nice
You're looking very nice
Now I'm obsessive, walking through keyholes
Fixing picture prints, letting the soil drain
I had a temper, but now I'm delicate
I keep it to myself, I keep it to myself
Silver in your eyes
The sin that's connected
Red and open wide
Of life in the wild

Partners in motion, beautiful devotion
Take over dream nights to find love
Partners in motion, beautiful devotion
To know you can, you don't have to go
Partners in motion, beautiful devotion
Take on my dream
Partners in motion, beautiful devotion
