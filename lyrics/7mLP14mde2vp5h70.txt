Shiny hands pull away from me tearing me apart
Play for me like you used to like we did as kids back in '92
Sleepy little daydreamer, tell me all you know
Catch the sun, don't let it go, send it all to me
Life's a game to all of us, play it before you go
Turn away, turn away, don't let me go
This is what we have to be, this is what we have to be

Turn away, don't watch me, I'm turning off this show
This is all, this is all, this is all I'm gonna say to you
Turn away, don't watch me, I'm turning off this show
This is all, this is all, this is all I'm gonna say to you

Don't go away, stay here and sing for me
Like you used to, I won't say a word
We're sleepy little daydreamers kissing, oh, so slow
Don't give up, I won't let you but I want you to want me to
Your life's a game to all of us play it before you go
Turn away, turn away, don't let me go
This is what we have to be, this is what we have to be

Turn away, don't watch me, I'm turning off this show
This is all, this is all, this is all I'm gonna say to you
Turn away, don't watch me, I'm turning off this show
This is all, this is all, this is all I'm gonna say to you
