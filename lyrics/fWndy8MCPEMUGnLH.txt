This room feels strange with the lights turned on
There's traces of jealousy left over memories built on
the floor It's hard to breathe when the smoke won't clear
We made the same mess and we'd do it so recklessly
Each day in every year

You don't get the right to call when you like You gave that away
Just another lie, you push it to the side Yeah, you sealed your fate

You put this love in a casket
Now there's no time to lie
No way to change my mind
Didn't give a damn when you had it
Don't turn the ashes now
'Cause this fire is long burned out
You put this love in a casket

It's only blame in the bed you left
Well, I'm getting sick of this
Trying to fix all the things that you wrecked
You were sure you wouldn't be replaced Your love is dead to me
She's lying next to me Filling your space

You put this love in a casket
Now there's no time to lie
No way to change my mind
Didn't give a damn when you had it
Don't turn the ashes now
'Cause this fire is long burned out
You put this love in a casket

You don't get the right to call when you like
You gave that away
Just another lie, you push it to the side Yeah, you sealed your fate

You put this love in a casket
Now there's no time to lie
No way to change my mind
Didn't give a damn when you had it And don't turn the ashes now
'Cause this fire is long burned out
You put this love in a casket
