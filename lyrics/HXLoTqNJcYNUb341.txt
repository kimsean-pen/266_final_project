What you gonna do when it all breaks down
Take another heart through the lonely town
What you gonna do when she turns around
And says i never, ever thought that you'd be messing around
But then you dance, dance, dance,
with the woman that let you
How's it gonna feel until i catch you,
What you gonna do when she turns around
And says you broken another heart that was broken down,
It's a crying shame, that the love you've made
Is a cross that you bear when it's cold
Why don't you leave me alone?
Take a chance
with the woman that let you
Take a chance
with the woman that let you
How's it gonna feel up and down
Chasing another heart, there was zipping down
What you gonna do when you turn around
And says i never, ever thought that you'd be messing around
But then you dance, dance, dance,
with the woman that let you
How's it gonna feel until i catch you,
How you gonna fail where she had in mind
If you continue that of peachy that you now about
It's a crying shame, that the love you've made
It's a cross that you bear
It's a crying shame, that the love you've made
it's a cross that you bear when it's cold
Why don't you leave me alone?
Take a chance
with the woman that let you
Take a chance
with the woman that let you
Take a chance
Take a chance
What you gonna do when it all went down
Chasing another heart, Just little woman
How you gonna feel when you see her down
And says i never, ever thought that you'd be messing around
But then you dance, dance, dance,
with the woman that let you
What you gonna do until i catch you?
How you gonna feel when she turns around?
And says you broken another heart that was broken down,
It's a crying shame, that the love you've made
It's a crying shame, that the love you've made
It's a crying shame, that the love for you've won
Put your back on me
Put your back on me
