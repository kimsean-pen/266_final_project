I'm not pygmalion
Hooked by failure
Ruled as a juvenile
Aged as an infantile
Subject to the ladder

Ruined by affection
Excepted by exception
Predicted on a graph
Cornered by ritual
Diminished by impression
Cried out in the lesson
Subject to the ladder
Subject to the ladder

My thoughts are coming through
Emptiness follows too
A cyclone full on feeling
In the silence of the room

Defended by defendants
Corrected by the pain
Inspected by a sadness
Exhausted by a game
Subject to the ladder
Subject to the ladder

My thoughts are coming through
Emptiness follows too
A cyclone full of feeling
The silence of the room

A picture turning over
Jewel in the water
Where eco saw reflection
Not what it taught her
Invaded by the quarrels
And I denied the lathe
Let me chop down the laurel
A goal I won't escape

In bullied deception
But when the whistle came
Esteem had broke infection
My torment faught with shame
Subject to the ladder
Subject to the ladder

My thoughts are coming through
Emptiness follows too
A cyclone full of feeling
The silence of the room
Subject to the ladder
