The devil told me never take a trip down memory lane
I claim insane and blame the game for making me drained and stained
I was brought here just so I could fuck up and then die
Sweet suicide
I want to be crucified
If life is a game do not deal me in
just put a bullet in my fucking head
Fuck God
Never gave me a response so I listen to the devil instead
Yeah, bitch, steady wishing I was dead
666 ways to kill me
A switchblade will spill me
A pit of flames will fill me until I commit an Ocean $ide $uicide
Jump off a cliff and then land in the waves
Take me away and bring me back to where I came from

The triple six theory, I'm dropping the blade and I enter abyss
The infamous lunatic, $uicide shawty's be fucking your bitch
The G, the 5, the 9
I'm Satan's seed
$crimmy be smoking the herb, I bleed with the earth
Now come and follow me
I need
To get me some dope so I'm breaking
the pound and I'm selling it by the G
This the chronicles of $uicide
Every fucking night I'm praying that I die
Every fucking time I go and get too high
End up adding numbers to my homicide
This the chronicles of $uicide
