Echo looked the best at night
Echo looked the best at night
He ran around town, drawn to the crown
Echo looked the best at night

You're not a boy after this
You're not a boy after this
You're not a boy, you're not a boy, you're not a boy after this

Everyone they thought he was gas
Everyone they thought he was gas
Nobody knows what made him blow
Everyone they thought he was gas

You're not a boy after this
You're not a boy after this
You're not a boy, you're not a boy, you're not a boy after this

Echo sent the boy downtown
Echo sent the boy downtown
He left him in a state they all celebrate
Echo sent the boy downtown
You're not a boy after this
You're not a boy after this
You're not a boy, you're not a boy, you're not a boy after this

Nightrest was a drug of choice
Nightrest was a drug of choice
Nobody knows where it all goes
Nightrest was a drug of choice

You're not a boy after this
You're not a boy after this
You're not a boy, you're not a boy, you're not a boy after this

Kids grow up too fast
The kids grow up too fast
Echo took a shot, they all got caught
As kids grow up too fast

You're not a boy after this
You're not a boy after this
You're not a boy, you're not a boy, you're not a boy after this
