I can't buy your love, don't even wanna try.
Sometimes the truth won't make you happy, so I'm not gonna lie.
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you

It beats only for you.
I know i'm far from perfect, nothin' like your entourage
I can't grant you any wishes, I won't promise you the stars.

But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you.
Cause when you've given up.
When no matter what you do it's never good enough.

When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
Thats when you feel my kind of love.
And when you're crying out.
When you fall and then can't pick, you're happy off the ground

When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around.
That's when you feel my kind of love.

You won't see me at the parties, I guess I'm just no fun.
I won't be turning up the radio singing "Baby You're The One".

But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you.
And I know sometimes I get angry, and I say what I don't mean.

I know I keep my heart protected, far away from my sleeve.
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you.

Cause when you've given up.
When no matter what you do it's never good enough.
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
Thats when you feel my kind of love.
And when you're crying out.
When you fall and then can't pick, you're happy off the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around.
That's when you feel my kind of love.
Oh that's when you feel
Yeah that's when you feel
Oh that's when you feel
My kind of love
Cause when you've given up.(given up)
When no matter what you do it's never good enough.(good enough)
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
That's when you feel my kind of love.
And when you're crying out(crying out)
When you fall and then can't pick you're happy off the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around
That's when you feel
My kind of love
I can't buy your love, don't even wanna try
Sometimes the truth won't make you happy
So I'm not gonna lie
But don't ever question
If my heart beats only for you
It beats only for you
