I first saw you.
You had on blue jeans.
Your eyes couldn't hide anything.
I saw you breathing
And I saw you staring out in space.
I next saw you, you was at a party.
Thought you was a queen, oh so flirty.
I came against.
Didn't say excuse.
You knew what I was doing,
We looked very fine 'cause we were leaving.
Like Saint Joan, doing a cool, cool jerk
Oh I want you, Oh I want you... like a kangaroo...
