I am not a man
I feel more like
emptiness, solitude
I am not a man
I feel more like
chemicals coming through

Why are you whispering so politely
when all around me the house is burning down?
the house is falling down

I hear what you say but not what you're saying
I know it's a game but what are we playing
It won't be the same
You're not around
It's like the house is falling down
It's like the house is falling down

I've been here before
Open fist
Open door
Oh what have I done, what have, what what, what have, what, what, what,

Why are you whispering so politely
when all around me the house is burning down?
the house is falling down

I hear what you say but not what you're saying
I know it's a game but what are we playing
It won't be the same
You're not around
It's like the house is falling down
It's like the house is falling down

I hear what you say but not what you're saying
I know it's a game but what are we playing
And it won't be the same
You're not around
It's like the house is falling down
It's like the house is falling down

Like the house is falling down
It's like the house is falling down
