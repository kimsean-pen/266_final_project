Parallel Crossing Lines
I Don't Want To Fall Behind
Is It Too Much To Cope
Not Running Down An Empty Hole

New Brigade
Will Never Fade
It Grows and Grows
Could Never End

It's Within Me
It's Within You
It's Within Me And You

This Is A Blood Path
Betrayal Is A Sin
Pointlessness In Surroundings
Cannot Ruin Things
Can You Keep A Promise
Alliance Is Our Home
We'll Stay Together
In Brotherhood It Shows
