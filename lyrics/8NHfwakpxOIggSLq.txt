Shadowed truth never tries to hide
An inconvenient pride
Builds abundant supplies
As the Puritan dies
The attrition machine
Builds a new guillotine
And in the place of its birth
Breeds a new Nazarene

Grind down the iron gears
Plunge the pike, work, work

With extinct human skills
Nevermore can you choose
Now oppressor resistor
You've got nothing to lose
With a noble existence
Forged through heart and through hand
This machine has burned down
The ever providing man

Grind down the iron gears
Plunge the pike, work, work

A distant wind breeds fire
Burning tall
Preaching to the choir
The lost retain control
Oh, burn 'em down

Now hungry for oblivion
What have the powerful become
Piles of flesh, greed and sin
Devoured by the teeth of angry laymen
Plunging the knife
In this black industry
A humbled rebirth
The green Earth now remains free

Grind down the iron gears
Plunge the pike, work, work

Grind down the iron gears
Plunge the pike, work, work

A distant wind breeds fire
Burning tall
Preaching to the choir
The lost retain control

Collective reason by riot
The oppressor cannot deny it
Technology burns
When the Luddite returns
