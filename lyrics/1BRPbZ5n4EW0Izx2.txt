when this life it gets you down and you just can't find the sound
of the world around you
cubist castle is a place we have been to
i know i have seen all mine and your friends there

when the people downtown are slowly fading
i know their stories are still being written

there is hope for everything for this life we're all living
and in my dim reflections

when the people downtown are slowly fading
we know their stories are still being written
