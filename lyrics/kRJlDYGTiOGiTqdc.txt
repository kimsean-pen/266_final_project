You see through me in time
And I ride white horses on hills
I long for you
All through bleeding June
Will I reach silent seas?
I wait on the white hills
In ropes that unwind

So what does life loan you again?
A long time
Salt-eyed starless nights

Time loans you again, give me one more time
One more, just give me one more time

Time incoming, life becoming
Time incoming, I'm coming in
Time incoming, life becoming
Time incoming, ropes unwinding
When I wait, when I wait
Time incoming, life becoming in
Ropes unwinding, time becoming in
Life becoming in, oh I'm coming in
Times incoming, life becoming
Ropes unwinding
