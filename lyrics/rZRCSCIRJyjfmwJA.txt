My head is a circus
It's all just too much
I guess my best was not good enough
And something is certain
I miss you around
And all that I want is to be with you

You kept me breathing under the water
When everyone else left me to drown
You were the light that shone through the darkness
Now I'm blind 'cause you're not around

I know I'm not perfect
I let you down
I guess that I'm paying the price for it now

You kept me breathing under the water
When everyone else left me to drown
You were the light that shone through the darkness
Now I'm blind 'cause you're not around

I don't know how we got here
But I know I don't belong
I don't know how we got here
Or why I'm holding on

You kept me breathing under the water
When everyone else left me to drown
You were the light that shone through the darkness
Now I'm blind 'cause you're not around

You kept me breathing under the water
When everyone else left me to drown
You were the light that shone through the darkness
Now I'm blind 'cause you're not around
