Baby, our city's on fire
Don't you know it's going to be alright
Alright, alright, alright
Lately, running through the bombs
Don't you know it's going to last all night
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright.
Baby, revolution is over
You and me it's going to be alright
Alright, alright, alright
Hard times won't last forever
Don't you know we've got some real good time
Alright, alright, alright
There was a time
She called me sweet, my hero, my cute thing
I gave her all the love I got
Baby, for you I'm a man
This is how I got to prove my love (I love that)
Baby, left me for another
Don't you know it's going to be alright
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright
There was a time
She called me sweet, my hero, my cute thing
I gave her all the love I got
Baby, our city's on fire
Don't you know it's going to be alright
Alright, alright, alright
Hard times won't last forever
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright, alright, alright
