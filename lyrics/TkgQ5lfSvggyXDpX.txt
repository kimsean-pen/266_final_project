Who's seen Jezebel?
She was born to be a woman I would know
And hold like a breeze half as tight as both our eyes closed
And who's seen Jezebel?
She when walking where the cedars line the road
Her blouse on the ground where the dogs were hungry, roaming, sayin',
"Wait, we swear we'll love you more,
And holy Jezebel,
It's we, we that you are for, only."
Who's seen Jezebel?
She was born to be a woman we could blame
Make me a beast half as brave I'd be the same
Who's seen Jezebel?
She was gone before I ever got to say,
"Lay here my love, you're the only shape I'll pray to, Jezebel."

Who's seen Jezebel?
Where the mountain lasts as long as I can wait
Wait like the dawn, how it aches to me the day
Who's seen Jezebel?
She was certainly the spark for all I've done
The window was wide, she could see the dogs come running, sayin',
"Wait, we swear we'll love you more,
And holy Jezebel,
It's we, we that you are for, only."
