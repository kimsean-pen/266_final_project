Where does outer space end
It's sort of hard to imagine is it real?

Is it nothin', nothin'?
'Cause it's not so clear anymore to me

Why do birds always fly south
When sometimes it's warm with yer headwound

Is that nothin', nothin'?
'Cause it's not so clear anymore to me

And if God hears all my questions
Well how come there's never an answer?

Is it nothin', nothin'?
