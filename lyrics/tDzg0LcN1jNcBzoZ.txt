If I can't fall for you I can't fall in love
If I can't fall for you I can't fall in love

We were high upon the highlight
Wide open like a lifeline (?)
We said this could be our anthem
You and I will never change
When you say my name so sweet
Roll of your tongue like its honey
But I'm going sentimental
God, only go let's be honest
I can be your liar liar liar liar
If I can't fall for you I can't fall in love
If I can't fall for you I can't fall in love
I can be your liar liar liar liar
If I can't fall for you I can't fall in love
If I can't fall for you I can't fall in love

I stop between my starts now
Are your mattress lying face down
I know we're about to fade out
Even if we'd be so right
When you say my name so sweet

Roll of your tongue like its honey
But I'm going sentimental
God, only go let's be honest
I can be your liar liar liar liar
If I can't fall for you I can't fall in love
If I can't fall for you I can't fall in love
I can be your liar liar liar liar
If I can't fall for you I can't fall in love
If I can't fall for you I can't fall in love

I can be your liar-oh-oh
Be your liar
I can be your liar-oh-oh
If I can't fall for you I can't fall in love

Stop this science fiction
With everything I wish for
Like you from a distance
And I know if I can't fall for you I can't fall in love
If I can't fall for you I can't fall in love

If I can't fall for you I can't fall in love
If I can't fall for you I can't fall in love
