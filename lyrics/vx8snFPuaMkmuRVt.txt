Now I want someone badly
Got a girl here tonight
Wants someone new
Someone new
A little cry wants someone badly
I wanna know if this is a bad lease on me

(I want to know) I want to know
Am I sure that I heard you right
I want to know
If you're leaving just do it tonight

Now I want someone badly
To burn in here with me
You better listen baby
'cause I cry all over madly

Ooh I wanna know (I wanna know)
Am I sure that I have your love
I wanna know (I wanna know)
If you're leaving just make sure it's right

Now I want someone badly
Could it be true
That someone is you
