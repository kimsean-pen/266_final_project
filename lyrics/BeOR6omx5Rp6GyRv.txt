I always thought I needed someone else
I guess I really really didn't like myself
I've been in a competition with myself
I'm 'bout to take a vacation with myself

I'd rather be alone inside my room
Than always be alone when I'm next to you
I think it's time I got down with no one else
I fell in love with isolation

All on my own
With nobody to hurt
I'm cutting dessert
Finally figured out what I'm worth
I'm loving my difficulties
It's making me stronger
It's making me triple my fees
So payoff lasts longer

I always thought I needed someone else
I guess I really really didn't like myself
I've been in a competition with myself
I'm 'bout to take a vacation with myself

I'd rather be alone inside my room
Than always be alone when I'm next to you
I think it's time I got down with no one else
I fell in love with isolation

I'm revealing abilities
No concealing this masterpiece
I'm talking like Master P
Make 'em say: ughh
I came to stun
Have a little fun
Maybe teach a nun that
She's bigger than the sun
Or anybody's son
Look what I become
Got the moon on the run (Yeah!)

I always thought I needed someone else
I guess I really really didn't like myself
I've been in a competition with myself
I'm 'bout to take a vacation with myself

I'd rather be alone inside my room
Than always be alone when I'm next to you
I think it's time I got down with no one else
I fell in love with isolation
