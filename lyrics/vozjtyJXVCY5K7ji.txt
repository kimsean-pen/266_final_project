I don't know where you're going
But I know where you've been
I've been tracing all your footsteps
I've been counting up your sins
A ticking bomb, a false alarm, a wrecking ball
You left before I had the chance to say

"Just call me in the morning"
Call me when you're home
I know what you've been through
Don't let go
Don't let go

Well you reached into my mouth
Pulled out a single bloody tooth
I've never shown that to anyone
Yeah, no one knows but you
A ticking bomb, a false alarm, a wrecking ball
I left before you had the chance to say

"Just call me in the morning"
Call me when you're home
I know what you've been through
Don't let go
Honey, don't let go
Just call me in the morning
Call me when you're home
I know what you've been through
Don't let go
Oh

You never knew that it would take so long
(You never knew that it would take so)
To understand you're right where you belong

I don't know where we're going
But I know where we've been
We've been hiding from each other
We've been hiding from our sins

Call me in the morning
Call me when you're home
I know what you've been through
Don't let go
Call me in the morning
Call me when you're home
I know what you've been through
Don't let go
(Don't let go)
Don't know where we're going
(Don't let go)
But I know where we've been
(Don't let go)
We've been hiding from each other
(Don't let go)
We've been hiding from our sins

Call me when you're home
I know what you've been through
Don't let go
