I found your love
In a crowded club
I was high and drunk
Don't remember much
It's OK
'Cause I woke up next to you
And we became more than friends
And if I could I would

Yeah, I would do it again
Yeah, I would do it again
So can we do it again?

Do I have to ask?
Can't a good thing last?
Did we move too fast?
I can't live in the past anymore
'Cause I thought we had something
But then it came to an end
And if I could I would

Yeah, I would do it again
Yeah, I would do it again
So can we do it again?

Yeah, I know we just don't work
But maybe we could be friends?
And if I could I would

Yeah, I would do it again
Yeah, I would do it again
So can we do it again?
