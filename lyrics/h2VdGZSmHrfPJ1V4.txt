Tongue Tied
I can feel the shadows
Your eyes
I don't know 'em now

Tongue Tied
I can feel the shadows
Your eyes
I don't know you now

Cannibal Star
Come over and listen
And cut me apart
To show what I'm missing
I don't ever know
How to hold
The weight of my soul
When letting go

But I'm falling
In my own illusion
I don't know
My
Way back

Tongue Tied
And I feel the shadows
Your eyes
I don't know 'em now

Tongue Tied
And I feel the shadows
I don't know
My (Oh I)
Way back (I don't know you now)
Home

Tongue Tied
And I feel the shadows
Your eyes
Tongue Tied
