I woke up I was already me
I was somewhat afraid I was something
Peace Signs
I told you I could no longer see
I was right in the fire I was on my knees
Peace Signs
Take it back I felt no longer used
I had nothing to do I was so you
Peace sign I was already you
Peace sign I was already you
Peace sign I was already you
No lie I was no longer wrong
I had questions in mind why you were strong
Hit back it was already too
Hit back it was already soon
Hit back it was already too...
I still dream that I think of you
In the calm of the night and I don't know what to do
Peace Signs
When I woke up I was already me
And I am not afraid I am something
Peace Signs
