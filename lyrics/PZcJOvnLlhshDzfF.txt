We're all still the same dear
I have owned this life forever
I'll always remain
If it's just the same dear
Why have you left before "forever?"
Yet returned
Again?

If you show me heaven
I will meet you there

How it breaks their hearts
That we've made an art
Of desecrating our
Sanctuaries
Sanctuaries

We're one and the same dear
You were born for this forever
Forget your restraint
Remnants of a past here
Pass like light through dust as memories
Fall fleeting
Like pain

If you show me heaven
I will meet you there

How it breaks their hearts
That we've made an art
Of desecrating our
Sanctuaries

Sanctuaries
Sanctuaries

How it breaks their heart

Desecrate our
Sanctuaries
Desecrate our
Sanctuaries
Desecrate our
Sanctuaries

Desecrate...
Our sanctuaries

How it breaks their hearts
That we've made an art
Of desecrating our
Sanctuaries

How it breaks their hearts
That we've made an art
Of desecrating our

Sanctuaries
