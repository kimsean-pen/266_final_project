HUMANS

Released the clutch and drove it thru the wall
I have counted all my demons and this is what Ive got
Been waiting for the train to depart
got stuck outside, left to die and a broken heart
Ill Freeze in the storm
Ill freeze in the night

Humans yes we are, yes we are
Torn away, yes torn apart
Humans yes we are, yes we are
And we all fell, before the fall

Shock the bottle empty in my hand
haven't found any reason not end what I am
Been waiting for a chance to walk by
Empty words empty thoughts left me here to die
Ill Freeze in the storm
Ill freeze in the night

Humans yes we are, yes we are
Torn away, yes torn apart
Humans yes we are, yes we are
And we all fell, before the fall

Rushing hour, you're wide awake
I wouldn't take a second brake Â¨
Rushing hour, you're wide awake
I wouldn't take no more mistakes

Humans yes we are, yes we are
Torn away, yes torn apart
Humans yes we are, yes we are
And we all fell, before the fall
