Well, you tried it just for once found it all right for kicks
But now you found out that it's a habit that sticks
And you're an orgasm addict, you're an orgasm addict
Sneaking in the back door with dirty magazines
Now your mother wants to know 'bout all those stains on your jeans
And you're an orgasm addict, you're an orgasm addict
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
You get in a heat, you get in a sulk
But you still keep a-beating your meat to pulp
And you're an orgasm addict, you're an orgasm addict
You're a kid Casanova, you're no Joseph
It's a labor of love fucking yourself to death
Orgasm addict, you're an orgasm addict
Uh huh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
You're makin' out with school kids
Winos and heads of state
You even made it with the lady
Who puts the little plastic bobbins on the Christmas cakes
Butchers' assistants and bellhops
You've had them all here and there
Children of God and their joy strings
International women with no body hair
Ooh, so whether you're asking in an alley and your voice ain't steady
Your sex mechanic's rough, you're more than ready
You're an orgasm addict, you're an orgasm addict
Johnny want fuckie always and all ways
He's got the energy, he will remain
He's an orgasm addict, he's an orgasm addict
He's always at it
He's always at it
And he's an orgasm addict
He's an orgasm addict
