You, you came into this life
To see what you could find
You took me for a friend
Afraid, I know you feel this way
But I can't seem to take
Your mind away from it

And I know these things will fall apart
I'm growing from the very start
I finally see the place
Where you and I will make our final mark
Upon our interrupted hearts
And finally a flame erupts inside

And I feel the wave crashing down
I hear that solitary sound
I feel the wave crashing down
All around, you were always on my mind

Go, see it to it's end
Make all your amends and tell me when it's over
Fade into the silent light
I feel it all the time
But you don't recognize this world

I feel for you my love
I'm afraid of this world
Fall away from the nigh

And I feel the wave crashing down
I hear that solitary sound
I feel the wave crashing down
All around, you were always on my mind

And I feel the wave crashing down
I hear that solitary sound
I feel the wave crashing down
All around, you were always on my mind
