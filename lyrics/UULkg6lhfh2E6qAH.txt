Falling asleep on a train ride home
Waking up at the end of the line alone
All alone
All alone

If it's for nothing
Just a dream
What's the point now?
This routine

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Spending half a day checking my phone
Keep saying that I'll quit, but I won't
It's all I know
It's all I know

If it's for nothing
Just a dream
What's the point now?
This routine

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Working all day, what's it mean?
I'm losing myself in this routine
Is it for nothing, like a dream?
What's the point now? This routine
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If it's for nothing
Just a dream
What's the point now?
This routine

Yeah, yeah, yeah
(This same routine)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(It's killing me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(This same routine)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(It's killing me)
