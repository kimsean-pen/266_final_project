This is a fucked up world
Driven hard by greed and lust
Insanity is taking over
Let us all into self-destruct

Lock, load, fire away
Let it burn or let it smolder away
Keep on digging your grave
Refuse? Time's ticking away
When the walls come crashing down
Who will wear the crown

Saints! Don't be afraid
Let it out, I wanna hear your thunder
Sinners! Are you ready to rage?
Loud and proud, I wanna hear your thunder
Saints! Don't be afraid
The man upstairs wants to feel your thunder
Sinners! Are you ready to rage?
The beast below wants to feel your thunder

Our hope just fades away
In God we're supposed to trust
Insanity is taking over
Let the fires of hell rise up

Lock, load, fire away
Let it burn or let it smolder away
Keep on digging your grave
Refuse? Time's ticking away
When the walls come crashing down
Who will wear the crown

Saints! Don't be afraid
Let it out, I wanna hear your thunder
Sinners! Are you ready to rage?
Loud and proud, I wanna hear your thunder
Saints! Don't be afraid
The man upstairs wants to feel your thunder
Sinners! Are you ready to rage?
The beast below wants to feel your thunder

Feel your thunder

Lock, load, fire away
Lock, load, fire away
Lock, load, fire away
Time is tick tick ticking away

Saints! Don't be afraid
Let it out, I wanna hear your thunder
Sinners! Are you ready to rage?
Loud and proud, I wanna hear your thunder
Saints! Don't be afraid
The man upstairs wants to feel your thunder
Sinners! Are you ready to rage?
The beast below wants to feel your thunder
