I've heard a phantom ring
I've awakened to a lie
Prying up the eyes
To a shitty view with a shot of life

I felt a tidal wave
And I watched the city lights
Illuminate 'em bright
And a little walk in the dead of night
Why must, we not, act tonight
Too many lies here
We wait, the knife, we take a bite
Nobody wins here

It violates and blinds the eyes
But I found a new world

So seventeen again
I can hear the bell and tower
I will be devoured
Will ya follow me to the witching hour

Why must, we not, act tonight
To many lies here
We wait, the knife, we take a bite
Nobody wins here
I've lost, the nerve, I'm finalized
Too many die here
I fall hands down, l pray
I don't give an F-U-C-K

It violates and blinds the eyes
But I found a new world
My head will ache, I brave the fire
Yeah, I found a new world
My heart awaits, the grand design
I found a new door
I'm un-contained, I'm crucified
I found a new world, I'm lost deep inside of it

Why must, we not, act tonight
To many lies here
We wait, the knife, we take a bite
Nobody wins here
I've lost, the nerve, I'm finalized
Too many die here
I fall hands down, l pray
I don't give an F-U-C-K

It violates and blinds the eyes
But I found a new world
My head will ache, I brave the fire
Yeah, I found a new world
My heart awaits, the grand design
I found a new door
I'm un-contained, I'm crucified
I found a new world, I'm lost deep inside of it
