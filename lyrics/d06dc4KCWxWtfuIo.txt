My cold black kitty she won't bite
But she's been sat outside all night
Her whiskers dirty and her eyes are bright
You'll do anything when she comes inside
My cold black kitty she won't bite
She just wants to come inside
She don't like to be treated nice
She never once had to tell me twice
If you're not careful when you sleep
You'll wake up and she's at your feet
And I know boys been driven mad
Wanting something they can't have
Yeah oh
Yeah oh
But if I don't get your letter soon
All kinds of problems in your room
So out with confessions and on with life
Your pretty face is the kind I like
My cold black kitty she won't budge
She just wants to come inside
She don't like to be treated nice
She never once had to tell me twice
If you're not careful when you sleep
You'll wake up and she's at your feet
And I know boys been driven mad
Wanting something they can't have
Yeah oh
Yeah oh
If you're not careful when you sleep
You'll wake up and she's at your feet
And I know boys been driven mad
Wanting something they can't have
