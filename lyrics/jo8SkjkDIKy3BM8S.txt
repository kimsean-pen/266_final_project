Yesterday, I saved the world
I know it seems a bit absurd
But trust in me, my every word
I flew the sky just like a bird

Guess you miss the news tonight (the hero of the story)
It's like you haven't realized
I gave my all, I risked my life
Just to get you by my side

(Ooo) I think I tried everything
(Ooo) But you don't hear anything
(Ooo) What can make you listen?
I can't take it no more

I fight to do my best for you
I won't let you down, won't let you down
I know I'm dreaming but I'll carry through
I won't let you down, won't let you down

I wanna be your hero, be your hero
I wanna be your hero
I will never let you down

I know I'm just a normal guy
But superpowers make you smile
So how can I get close to you?
It's really all I wanna do

I fight to do my best for you
I won't let you down, won't let you down
I know I'm dreaming but I'll carry through
I won't let you down, won't let you down

I wanna be your hero, (be-e)
Be your hero
I wanna be your hero
Say that you are in need of me now

I wanna be your hero, (be-e)
Be your hero
I wanna be your hero
I will never let you down

(Ooo) I think I tried everything
(Ooo) But you don't hear anything
(Ooo) What can make you listen?
I can't take it no more

I wanna be your hero
Be your hero
I wanna be your hero
Say that you are in need of me now (now, now, now)

I wanna be your hero (be-e)
Be your hero
I wanna be your hero
I will never let you down

(Hero, be your hero) Oh,
(I wanna be your hero) Never let me down (be your hero)
