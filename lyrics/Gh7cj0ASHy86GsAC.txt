Remember me, feels like forever
Since the days when we were friends
Don't understand all these changes
I'm still the same no need to pretend

Where it go? Do you know?
Maybe just doesn't matter
'Cause when I try to talk to you
I feel like I'm not getting through to you
Where did we go wrong?
It's hard to be strong when I talk
When I talk to you

There were times in the beginning
When you were there when I needed you most
We sit and talk about the future
And laugh about us getting old

Do you know how it feels?
I hope that you know that it matters
But when I try to talk to you
I feel like I'm not getting through to you
Where did we go wrong?
It's hard to be strong when I talk

When I talk to you
I want you to know everything that I am
Don't want to know what life would be without you

When I try to talk to you
I feel like I'm not getting through you
Where did we go wrong?
It's hard to be strong when I talk

When I talk to you
When I talk to you
When I talk to you
