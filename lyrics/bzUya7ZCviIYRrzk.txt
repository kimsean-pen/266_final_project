We let bygones be bygones
September's long but
We light a candle and wait for dawn
Nights under the trees
We breathe black holeeee... black holeeee.
Together we are pstereo
Soundless messages without a word
We Share our little secrets
I think we are ...
Together we're pstereo
So, lets do it like its pstereo
Together we're pstereo
(ooo oOoo OOoo OoOoo)
Do you hear the breeze?
I'm on branches without leaves
I (...)
(...) the once made
We are who we once were
We are who we once were
Together we are pstereo
Soundless messages without a word
We Share our little secrets
And I think we are
Together we're pstereo
So, lets do it like its pstereo
Together we're pstereo
(ooo oOoo OOoo OoOoo)
There's no questions without an answer
The wind, the wingless friends
becomes invisible in broad daylight
in broad daylight
I think we are ...
Together we're pstereo
So, lets do it like its pstereo
Together we're pstereo
(ooo oOoo OOoo OoOoo)
I think we are ...
Together we're pstereo
So, lets do it like its pstereo
Together we're pstereo
(ooo oOoo OOoo OoOoo)
I think we are ...
Together we're pstereo
So, lets do it like its pstereo
Together we're pstereo
(ooo oOoo OOoo OoOoo)
