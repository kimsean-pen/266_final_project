Where are my clothes? Where are my shoes?
It's all a blur in the morning
I medicate, I'm missing you
It's all a blur in the morning

Good friends, bad jokes, and bad tattoos
It's all a blur in the morning
I lose control, I'm missing you
It's all a blur in the morning

Is the party over?
Where's my head?
Out of touch with who I've been
A thousand miles away from you
Is this just bad luck or is the party over?
Where's my head?
Out of touch with who I've been
A thousand miles away from you
Is this just bad luck or is the party over?

Where is my phone? Did I miss you?
It's all a blur in the morning
I thought I saw your face when I came to
It's all a blur in the morning

How do we go?
It's all a blur in the morning
How did we choke
It's all a blur in the morning

Is the party over?
Where's my head?
Out of touch with who I've been
A thousand miles away from you
Is this just bad luck or is the party over?
Where's my head?
Out of touch with who I've been
A thousand miles away from you
Is this just bad luck or is the party over?

I won't blame you if you wanna turn around
I won't blame you, it's a long way down
I won't blame you if you wanna turn around
I won't blame you, it's a long way down

Cut me off tonight
Cut me off tonight
I won't blame you
Cut me off tonight
I won't blame you
Cut me off tonight

Is the party over?
Where's my head?
Out of touch with who I've been
A thousand miles away from you
Is this just bad luck or is the party over?
Where's my head?
Out of touch with who I've been
A thousand miles away from you
Is this just bad luck or is the party over?

It's all a blur in the morning
Cut me off tonight
How do we go?
Cut me off tonight
How did we choke
Cut me off tonight
How do we go?
It's all a blur in the morning
Cut me off tonight
How did we choke
It's all a blur in the morning
It's all a blur in the morning
