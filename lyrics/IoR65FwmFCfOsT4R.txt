give me some news
i have to know
i have to know

my brother sin of sin
tin cup rain goes straight to the brain
just like a bullet
you attacked and stuck
you know i love you like Diane cluck

my sweet thing now your dead
disappeared to fog
like the neighbors dog
i know you love me
and you meant no harm
so all is forgiven from the dusty farm

give me some news
i have to know
i have to know

don't forget all the times
i nearly died
in your arms like a daisy
hot on a farm
my torture was thus i took what i must
had to have you had to know
now polished and pressed
dressed to impress you falling all around
I'm outside the door
on you garden's floor
bareing bossom a blossom
soul reeking awesome

my lover ravaged thing
headache city don't go there again
flicker your fire
but don't get burned
you know i love you ash to the urn

my holy unpredictable
my fable teller
my starry stellar
you know i loved you from first eyes we met
and now I'm ready red hot and wet

give me some news
i have to know
i have to know
