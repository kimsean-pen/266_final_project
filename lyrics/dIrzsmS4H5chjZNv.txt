When the feeling's gone, there's nothing left, how can we go on
It's time for us, to realise, our feelings are all wrong

But maybe you and I will find a solitary wave
Will it serve to fill a void with many shades of grey?

When the feeling's gone,
The nights are long, there's frost behind the glare
A frenzied rush, a melting sigh, but neither of us care

Silent scenes of rainbow dreams are woven to disguise
A storyboard that illustrates a portrait of our lives

I never lost my way ahead you shimmered like a flare
Let's stand together once again on pavements in the air
