Hey you! Up in the sky
learning to fly
tell me how high
do you think you'll go
before you start falling
Hey you! Up in a tree
you wanna be me
but that couldn't be

'cos the people here they don't hear you calling
How does it feel

when you're inside me?
Hey you! Wearing the crown
making no sound
I heard you feel down
well that's too bad
welcome to my World
Hey you! Stealing the Light
I heard that the shines

gone out of your life
well that's too bad

welcome to my World
How does it feel
when you're inside me?
You'll need assistance with the things

That you have never ever seen
It's just a case of never breathing out

before you've breathed it in
How does it feel
when you're inside me?
I can feel you
can you feel me?
Hey you! Up in the sky
learning to fly
tell me how high

do you think you'll go
before you start falling

Hey you! Up in a tree
you wanna be me
but that couldn't be
'cos the people here they don't hear you calling
How does it feel
when you're inside me?
You'll need assistance with the things
That you have never ever seen
It's just a case of never breathing out
before you've breathed it in
How does it feel
when you're inside me?
