Hello! Hooray! Let the show begin
I've been ready
Hello! Hooray! Let the lights grow dim
I've been ready
Ready as this audience that's coming here to dream
Loving every second, every moment, every scream
I've been waiting so long to sing my song
And I've been waiting so long for this thing to come
Yeah, I've been thinkin' so long, I was the only one
Roll out! Roll out with your American dream and its recruits
I've been ready
Roll out! Roll out with your circus freaks and hula hoops
I've been ready
Ready as this audience that's coming here to dream
Loving every second, every moment, every scream
I've been waiting so long to sing my song
And I've been waiting so long for this thing to come
Oh, I've been thinking so long, I was the only one
And I can stand here strong and thin
And I can laugh when this thing begins
God, I feel so strong, I feel so strong
I'm so strong, I feel so strong
I feel so strong, so strong
God, I feel so strong, I am so strong
So strong, I feel so strong, I feel so strong
I feel so strong, I feel so strong, I feel so strong
Yes I'm strong, feel so strong, feel so strong
