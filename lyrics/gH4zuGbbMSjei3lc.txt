Make the bones in my body break
That all or nothing so shake
I want
I am out

Listen to your real song
I'm looking at my chain I'm a ranger
We always wanted to be high and courageous
We're all ninjas away with the chains now
There's danger on our??
Look out for the stranger on the train
Move
The devil's on my mind now
Move
He's all around inside now
Falling down power devour the system like an anvil of flying from one place to place
Move
Make the bones of my body break
Move
That all or nothing so shake
Move
The inner taste is so strong
Move
And listen to a real song
System's always lie about who we are
And we won't belong
So it won't be long
These systems always lie about who we are
So we won't belong
It won't be long
It won't be long

I went to meet Sheila
She was a diva
Se told me that my sister never did appeal to her
So down the banks of the river
We sit there casting at the trains that we share with the crew
And they're messing with the view??
We pulled down the system
We laughed at the system
Now no one gonna tells us that we ain't gonna blow the system
Now no one gonna tells us that we ain't gonna
These system's always lie about who we are
And we won't belong
So it won't be long
Systems always lie about who we are
So we won't belong
It won't be long
It won't be long
Make the bones of my body break
Move
That all or nothing so shake
Move
The inner taste is so strong
Move
And listen to a real song
System's always lie
And we won't belong
So it won't be long
These systems always lie about who we are
So we won't belong
It won't be long
It won't be long
And listen to a real song
I am out
