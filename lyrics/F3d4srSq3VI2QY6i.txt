It ain't always about you
See, for us to function it's gonna take two (yeah, yeah)
I'm letting you know what's on my mind
I told you bout a thousand times
Still it's always about you

You did dirt in the beginning
I just return you the favor
I tried to talk, you don't listen
You don't hear nothing I'm saying (no)
Yeah I admit we got issues
Most of em, we can't explain em
I don't know how to deal with em
So let's put em all on the table

Or we can not discuss it, let's just argue bout it later on, on
Or we can just continue making love until we're dead and gone, oh

And now you tell me you want to keep it real
And you swear you be down to grab the wheel
Like you gon ride, you say you wanna ride
On the real you don't know how I feel
I don't see how we ever gon heal
When all we do is fight

You did dirt in the beginning
I just return you the favor
I tried to talk, you don't listen
You don't hear nothing I'm saying (no)
Yeah I admit we got issues
Most of em, we can't explain em
I don't know how to deal with em
So let's put em all on the table

Or we can not discuss it, let's just argue bout it later on, on
Or we can just continue making love until we're dead and gone, oh
