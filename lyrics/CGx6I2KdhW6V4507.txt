This is my rebirth
this is my last night on Earth
witness my rebirth
this is my last night on Earth

A restless strain I can't explain as day fades into night
I turn my eyes towards the skies, await the coming flight
It will be my time to leave this world uncivilized
No more earthbound, I'll leave the ground for life beyond the skies

This is my rebirth
this is my last night on Earth
witness my rebirth
this is my last night on Earth

Beneath the reins my hope remains in uncharted galaxies
I'll hear the call amongst the sprawl of fading memories
Wait anxiously to take my seat and leave this place behind
I'll wave goodbye to those outside then jump the great divide

This is my rebirth
this is my last night on Earth
witness my rebirth
this is my last night on Earth

this is my last night on Earth
this is my last night
No more earthbound
I'll leave the ground
This is my last night on Earth

This is my rebirth
This is our last night on Earth
