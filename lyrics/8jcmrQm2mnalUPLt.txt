Can you remember a time when this city was
A great place for architects and dilettantes
A nice place for midwives and crossing guards
And on, and on...

Hold on, Hold on... children.
Your mother, your father are leaving

Do you remember a time when this pool was
A great place for waterwings and cannonballs
A nice place for astrologists and blow up dolls
And on, and on...

Hold on, Hold on... children...
Your mother, your father are leaving

Hold on, Hold on... children...
Your bestfriend's parents are leaving

Hold on, Hold on... children...
Your mother, your father are leaving

Hold on, Hold on... children...
Your bestfriend's parents are leaving, are leaving

Hold on, Hold on... children...
Your bestfriend's parents are leaving
