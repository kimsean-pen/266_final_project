Back in L.A.!
Oop! It's a nice day baby
Take your top off, come to the right bay
I know what your friends say
But they don't know you're pill
Just gimme one day, I teach 'em girls how to (chill)

Cause it's 4-20-24-7 where I'm at Hun
Cruisin' down sunset, lightning up a fat one
Let's make love, I never wanna fight
Baby we gotta shot, we should get it right

Get it right, alright
From the dark to the light
From the back to the middle to the front
Get high! L-L-Light it up! Raise that cup!

Put your motherfing haaaaands up!

(Left, Right, Baby, I give it to you real good)

It looks like I'm about to get in trouble
Here here bartender make it double
Doubledecker Tourbus – meet me at the top floor
You know the song baby, tryin' to get my top score

Cause I like your skinny jeans better
when they're laying on the ground
and your kashmir sweaters nowhere to be found
imma be around – maybe not as often as you like
but I think we vibed girl we should get it right

I just wanna do you real good
You make me feel good

Baby let me get it right
To the edge of the night to the light
I'll make you feel high

Baby we should get it right
Get it right, alright
From the dark to the light
From the back to the middle to the front
Get high! L-L-Light it up! Raise that cup!
Put your motherfing haaaaands up!
