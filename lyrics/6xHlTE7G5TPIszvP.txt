Piece it all together now
Because I sell myself short every time
Oh, how you became my life
You took me in before I could back out
Well I still have faith
It will start again
Oh, I still have faith

Well I'm about to spend my cold life
Cutting corners, placing blame
Any moment this could catch fire
Erasing all the stains, so here's to starting over
We could be the same, we'll change it all together
The future's mine to claim
Claim, mine to claim

You can't get out
Fear, couldn't place its hands on us my dear
My pride has dropped
Because I couldn't sell short myself this time
String it along
Say you'll love me either way

Well I'm about to spend my cold life
Cutting corners, placing blame
Any moment this could catch fire
Erasing all the stains, so here's to starting over
We could be the same, we'll change it all together
The future's mine to claim

Seeing past
It's about time I asked for more
Watching my life, at the distance we have come
While I bled, while I've learned
But I always seem to give up on my self
(Self, self, self, self)
String it along
Say you'll love me either way
Say you'll love me any way
While I'm alone
Say you'll love me either way

Mine to claim, claim!

Well I'm about to spend my cold life
Cutting corners, placing blame
Any moment this could catch fire
Erasing all the stains, so here's to starting over
We could be the same, we'll change it all together
The future's mine to claim...
