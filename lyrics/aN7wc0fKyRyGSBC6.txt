As I sit with eyes heavy, omen's clear
Face down in seclusion, the evil steer
What drives the stake within my heart
This man he fell apart
Now that the entrance is open wide
This black all around makes it's way inside
What have you done? Will hate abide?
Where is my death invitation? Elation?
Dead glimpse lurking beneath this prison, I
I give my life for a taste of
Taste of
What lies beyond the dead place now
Fire burns rising beneath these sins in time
I leave my life for the void
I have not tried
Survive
I will survive
Collapsed ceilings above drop rage upon them
Raging upon them
Stone cold fists and a memory run in on the blunt end of a blade
The blood that is spilled shall start my serenade
To you
I will survive
I will survive
Survive

Silence is bringing on the heart attack
Pushing and pulling going on within my brain
It says to lay low (to lay low)
Dead end
The darkness latches on
Now I am a product of a mind that wasn't ever mine and now it says "Kill them slow" (kill them slow)
Weighed down
I'm drowning in this stale moment
Renown is yelling at me from above
This is a one way road
Kill them slow
