Find a place that keeps you safe
Head down 'til the light of day
Ain't nobody you can blame

I've been looking for and wide
Running from the fear inside
Just close your eyes and drive

'Cause we are stronger now, than our fathers
Catch your head, I'm calling out, I'm there
Faint light flickering in the distance
You were breaking in

And we will find our way, then I'll know
Just like they do on the TV
Maybe we'll go from nothing to incredible
Just like they do on the TV

I'm older now
But I feel my time start to begin
Out on the road, they gonna advertise it
And I'm buying in

'Cause we are stronger now, than our fathers
Catch your head, I'm calling out, I'm there
I'm not waking up if I'm dreaming
It's where I want to stay

And we will find our way, then I'll know
Just like they do on the TV
Maybe we'll go from nothing to incredible
Just like they do on the TV

And we will find our way, then I'll know
Just like they do on the TV
Maybe we'll go from nothing to incredible
Just like they do on the TV

Find a place that keeps you safe
Head down 'til the light of day
Ain't nobody you can blame

I've been looking for and wide
Running from the fear inside
Just close your eyes and drive

Just like they do on the TV
Just like they do on the TV
Just like they do on the TV
Just like they do on the TV
Just like they do on the TV
Just like they do on the TV
