You're not running just enough of a wreck
To hold the hurt heart everybody expects
And I know you wrote a history of making a mess
Misunderstood's an understatement at best

How long, how long will you demand my sympathy?
We all know hurt, so why do you feel the need
To put on a pretty face, give them a pretty taste
No one's buying it anyway

You're so tired trying to rewind the mess
You've made of your own mind, woah
But the pieces won't pick up themselves, you know

You can fight just like you've been taught
It won't undo the life you've got, woah
'Cause the pieces won't pick up themselves, you know

You're not running just enough of a wreck
To hold the hurt heart everybody expects
And I know you wrote a history of making a mess
Misunderstood's an understatement at best

You say you try, you're after something better
It doesn't show, you're still not put together
Put on a pretty face, give them a pretty taste
No one's buying it anyway

You're so tired trying to rewind the mess
You've made of your own mind, woah
But the pieces won't pick up themselves, you know

You can fight just like you've been taught
It won't undo the life you've got, woah
'Cause the pieces won't pick up themselves, you know

Everybody knows liars never make it for long
I am getting close, I can see just what's going on
Everybody knows, everybody knows, woah

I remember what you were before you gave it away
You've never been the type to watch
The pieces fall where they may

And now you've let it go
But I know you know, woah
No the pieces won't pick up themselves, you know

You're so tired trying to rewind the mess
You've made of your own mind
But the pieces won't pick up themselves, you know
You can fight just like you've been taught
It won't undo the life you've got, woah
'Cause the pieces won't pick up themselves, you know
You're so tired trying to rewind the mess
You've made of your own mind, woah
(Everybody knows)
But the pieces won't pick up themselves, you know
You can fight just like you've been taught
It won't undo the life you've got, woah
(Everybody knows)
'Cause the pieces won't pick up themselves, you know
