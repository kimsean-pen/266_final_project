Snakes in the grass
I'm losing sleep over you
Heart beating fast
It reaches for what you do

Because of me you're like a broken mirror
Like a black cat crossing the road
Your presence is a curse
You want me and it hurts
It's only getting worse
(To me you're like a bad omen)

And I don't even want you that bad
You want me like a cloudy gray sky
And I don't need that kinda shit in my life
So turn around and run
Could you maybe run?
Baby 'til you run, run

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, bad omen
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Falling through the clouds

Walking the wires
No longer know what is true
Raising my tires
I'm losing speed over you

Because of me you're like a broken mirror
Like a black cat crossing the road
Your presence is a curse
You want me and it hurts
It's only getting worse
(To me you're like a bad omen)

And I don't even want you that bad
You want me like a cloudy gray sky
And I don't need that kinda shit in my life
So turn around and run
Could you maybe run?
Baby 'til you run, run

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, bad omen
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Falling through the clouds

And I don't even want you that bad
You want me like a cloudy gray sky
And I don't need that kinda shit in my life
So turn around and run
Could you maybe run?
Baby 'til you run, run

And I don't even want you that bad
You want me like a cloudy gray sky
And I don't need that kinda shit in my life
So turn around and run
Could you maybe run?
Baby 'til you run, run

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, bad omen
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Falling through the clouds

To me you're like a bad omen
