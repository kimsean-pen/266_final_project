Ouija, are you there?
Ouija, are you there?

Is there a presence among us?

Ouija
Ouija!

Dark is the memory I set out to forget
We used an oracle board to contact the dead
Beyond boredom and reason, we asked the name of the entity
The glass suddenly moved, spelling out "Charlie"

Why are you here?
What do you want?

Protect you.

How do you wish to protect me?
Charlie, are you a member of the family?

No, I am a friend.

Fun and excitement turned into fear and disbelief
It gave answers to questions brought forth openly
We moved the glass planchette to say our goodbye
It moved the pointer to "no" so we asked Charlie why

From that moment the atmosphere began to change
Kind answers became evasive, dark and strange
Threatening the spirit: Leave, in the name of the Lord!
Bone-chilling messages came forth from a talking board

Bitch!
Slut!
Whore!
Cunt!
Go fuck your God!
Fuck your God!
D-I-E spelled out repeatedly
It's threatening my family with death

The glass shattered
Releasing a scent of decay
We failed to perform a portal closing spell
Panicked, we ran away

(Charlie) Something is watching me
(Charlie) It's a shadow
(Charlie) It is following me

Why are you here?
What do you want?

Destroy you!

Charlie wants to kill me
Charlie is not a friend
