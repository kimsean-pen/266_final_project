Now this one reaching out to all the lovers
who might be thinking of breaking up
Uh, or maybe, making up
Check it

I missed a part of you I can't get back
Don't be a silly nilly
I'm always here for ya
Through the thick and thin
Not just because we argue

See I wanted to be true, but I can't do that
Why not, what's stopping you? Don't be preposterous
I've got a lot of love, not just a lot of lust
If I only wasn't a fool, I'd be loving
Well that's your own opinion, and you're entitled to it
I'll be lost in oblivion, if we don't continue through it

There's nothing wrong with you I can't fix!
I come a runnin' with my little bag o' tricks
In an emergency I'm very well prepared
My scalpel, mask and gloves; don't ever get too scared

Ooohooo, you're a Miracle Worker
Ooohooo, you're a surgeon of love
You have a medical condition
Ooohooo, can't wait to fix me up
And I promise I'll be back again
if you work your miracles on me

Your mentality was fresh
It touched my soul
Invigorating and refreshing, and interesting, and it feels right
My heart was drowing in stress
But you brought out the best in me
Love has a tendency, so I've been told, and so it seems like
My love and laser will regenerate your heart
No need for anesthetics
I'll go check your charts
I will reshape you, recast you from the mold
A brand new beautiful woman will blossom from the old

Ooohooo, you're a Miracle Worker
Ooohooo, you're a surgeon of love
You have a medical condition
Ooohooo, can't wait to fix me up
And I promise I'll be back again
If you work your miracles on me
Ooohooo, you're a Miracle Worker
Ooohooo, you're a surgeon of love
You have a medical condition
Ooohooo, can't wait to fix me up
And I promise I'll be back again
If you work your miracles on me
