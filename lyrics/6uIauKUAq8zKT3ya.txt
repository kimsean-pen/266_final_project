People need hope, people need loving
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand

Man has always wanted a woman by his side to keep him company
Women always knew that it takes a man to get matrimonial harmony
Everybody knows that a man who's feeling down wants some female sympathy
Gotta have love to carry on living
Gotta have love 'till eternity

People need hope, people need lovin'
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good livin'
People need faith in a helping hand

Flowers in the desert need a drop of rain
Like a woman needs her man
If a man's in love and his woman wants the moon
Then hell it down if he can
Somebody who loves you and somebody who cares
Isn't that what you'd call a friend?
Gotta have love to carry on living
Isn't it easy to understand

People need hope, people need lovin'
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good livin'
People need faith in a helping hand

People need hope, people need lovin'
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good livin'
People need faith in a helping hand
