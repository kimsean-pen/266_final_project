There is a lake between the sun and moon
Not too many know about
In the silence between whisper and shout
The space between wonder and doubt

This is a fine place, shining face to face
Those bonfire lights in the mirror of sky
The space between wonder and why

Ahh yes to yes to ahh to yes
Why the sun? Why the sun?

Ahh yes to yes to ahh to yes
Why the sun? Why the sun?

There is a fine line between love and illusion
A fine place to penetrate
The gap between an actor and an act
The lens between wishes and fact

This is a fine place, to hesitate
Those bonfire lights in the lake of sky
The time between wonder and why

Ahh ahh ahh ahh

Ahh yes to yes to ahh to yes
Why the sun? Why the sun?

Ahh yes to yes to ahh to yes
Why the sun? Why the sun?

Some need to pray to the sun at high noon
Need to howl at the midwinter moon
Reborn and baptized in a moment of grace
Just need a break from the headlong race

This is a fine place, shining face to face
Those bonfire lights in the mirrored sky
The space between wonder and why

Ahh yes to yes to ahh to yes
Ahh yes to yes to ahh ahh to yes
Why the sun? Why the sun?

Ahh yes to yes to ahh to yes
Why the sun? Why the sun?
