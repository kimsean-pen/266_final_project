Canadian Mounted, baby
Police force that works
Red and Black
It's their color scheme
Get their man
In the end
It's all right
Yeah, it's all right

Frontenac Chateau, baby
I cross the frontier at ten
Got a whip in my hand, baby
And a girl or a husky
At leather's end
It's all right
Yeah, it's all right baby
It's all right
Yeah, my lovely bel punice
You know you, you kill and you maim
The husky know

Mush you huskies-ride mush you huskies-ride mush you huskies
Ride mush you huskies-ride mush you huskies-ride mush you huskies
Ride mush you huskies-ride mush you huskies

Hornswoop me bungo pony on dogsled on ice
Make a dash for freedom, baby
Don't skate on polar ice
It's too thick to be sliced
By the light
Of long and white polar nights
It's all right
It's all right
Yeah, my lovely bel punice
You know you, you kill and you maim

Ah, here they come now, yeah
C'mon ride!
