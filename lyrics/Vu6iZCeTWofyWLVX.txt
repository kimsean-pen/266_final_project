Hey you, I don't want you to come talk to me
Ponder my life philosophy
Just leave me alone
You, you always come around to be a part of the gang
Looking for a reason to hang, don't you know I've heard it all before

You, pedaling bags of frivolity
Spewing your ideology
Just leave me alone
You, you always come around and torment me
You always come and to try to be a part of the gang
Looking for a reason to hang, don't you know I've heard it all before

Hey you, why do you want to come talk to me
Sit around and chew philosophy
Just leave me alone
You, you once again you've come to torment me
Spitting out slabs of agony
Seems like you are always stalking me
You always come around to be a part of the gang
Looking for a reason to hang, don't you know I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before
