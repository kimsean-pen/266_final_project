Hey baby, you never felt this good
Freedom through the stereo and you wish you could
Take a bite, do a dance and get lost on a crusade
Jump on this soul train, destination unknown

We're all dressed up
We got nowhere to go
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I told you so
I told you so
We're all dressed up
We got nowhere to go
All dressed up
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so

Hey baby, never felt this free
A pair of new shoes and a punk rock show to see
Give acclaimation to these blue ribbon babies
And check the calendar for the expiration date

We've all been bitten
We've all been underground
We've all been beaten, battered, bruised
Told to get down

We've all been bitten
We've all been shut down
We've all been beaten, battered, bruised
Told to get down

We're all dressed up
We got nowhere to go
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I told you so
I told you so
We're all dressed up
We got nowhere to go
All dressed up
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so

Adolescent beats with a new thing to see
Smashed guitars just like you've seen on TV
With burning speakers and with flaming hair
We'll have a riot right here
We'll have a riot right here
