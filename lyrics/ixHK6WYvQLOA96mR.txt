Oh, I remember things, not many things,
I don't remember where my feet touch the ground,
But I remember every word and every sound,
I remember every word and every sound.
I remember things, not many things,
I don't remember when the ships hit the sea,
But I remember my name and what they paid for me.

Lay me back down,
In the bed with the cold hearted people,
Listen to the word.
Lay me back down,
In the holes and the warmth that we've warmed up,
Listen to the word.
Lay me back down.

I remember things, not many things
I don't remember presidents or what they did
But I remember the wars and just who profited,
I remember the wars and just who profited.
I remember things, not many things,
I don't remember places in times,
I don't remember when the ships hit the sea,
But I remember the love and just who gave me it.

Lay me back down,
In the bed with the cold hearted people,
Listen to the word.
Lay me back down,
In the holes and the warmth that we've warmed up,
Listen to the word.
Lay me back down.

Lay me back down.
Lay me back down.
Lay me back down.
Lay me back down.

I hear them calling me back to the ground.
Lay me back down,
In the holes and the warmth that we've warmed up,
Listen to the word.
Lay me back down.

Lay me back down.
Lay me back down.
