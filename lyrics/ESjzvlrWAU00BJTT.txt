Gears turning that no wrench can attack
consideration, or pause had their time come and pass
no gloves bet you can't get enough
Make a fine parade so the public sways in your wake
...
I just thought that I would Go, till the money's gone
I never wanted to fake it
now I can't stop till Everyone, Who ever done me wrong
knows I'm not willing to take it
boy, you've got a Hard time bring yourself to glory
you've got a Hard time bring yourself to glory
I... I never wanted my name up in bright lights
but I think that I might be there soon
I owe it all to you (I owe it all to you)...
Hey, I was never Looking for fame or the limelight
but I think that I might be there soon
I owe it all To you
no one ever told me, what it meant to be alone...
I had to learn on my lonesome
now every feigning flame I chance upon I put the fire on
I keep my wheels in motion
Boy, you've had a hard time. Bring yourself to glory
I... I never wanted my name up in Bright lights
but I think that I might be there soon
I owe it all to you (I owe it all to you)...
Hey, I was never looking for fame or the limelight
but I think that I might be there Soon
I owe it all to you (I owe it all to you)
you've had a hard time, bring yourself to glory
you've had a hard time, bring yourself to glory
boy, you've had a hard time, bring yourself to Glory
and here's those spoils of war that you asked for
...
I... I never wanted my name up in bright lights
but I think that I might be there soon
I owe it all to you (I owe it all to you)...
hey hey, I was never looking for fame or the limelight
but I think that I might be there soon
I owe it all to you (I owe it all to you)...
