You've got me stuck to where I'm sittin'
Lookin' at your eyes
And I know I'm so pathetic
I wouldn't move to save my life
And they tell me that you're lonely
It's no surprise
When you walk around all day wearing those
Lonely, lonely, lonely eyes

Well, I try to tell you jokes
I'm afraid you'd cry
And if you need a little sunshine
You could borrow some of mine
It's okay if you're unhappy
I would say before I leave her
Just take a look around
There's no one here that's happy either

Lonely girl, you are my world
And I could be anything you need
And if for some reason you don't feel like talkin'
I could just sit and enjoy your company
Your company

Well, the days keep going by
And it doesn't get much better
You could be threatening to jump
And all your friends would just scream "let her"
They count on you to leave
'Cause it's has always been that way
But on the one day they close early
That's the one you want to stay

Lonely girl, you are my world
And I could be anything you need
And if for some reason you don't feel like talkin'
I could just sit and enjoy your company
Your company

Lonely girl, you are my world
And I could be anything you need
And if for some reason you don't feel like talkin'
I could just sit and enjoy your company

Lonely girl, you are my world
And I could be anything you need
And if for some reason you don't feel like talkin'
I could just sit and enjoy your company
Your company
Your company
