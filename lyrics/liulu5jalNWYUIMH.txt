Looking like a Born Again, living like a heretic
Listening to Arthur Lee records
Making all your friends feel so guilty about their cynicism
And the rest of their generation
Not even the government are gonna stop you now

But are you ready to be heartbroken?
Are you ready to be heartbroken?

Pumped up full of vitamins
On account of all the seriousness
You say you're so happy now
You can hardly stand

Lean over on the bookcase
If you really wanna get straight
Read Norman Mailer
Or get a new tailor

Are you ready to be heartbroken?
Are you ready to be heartbroken?
Are you ready to bleed?

What would it take, what would it take to wipe
That smile off of your face?
Are you ready to be?
Are you ready to bleed?

Are you ready to be heartbroken?
Are you ready to be heartbroken?
Well, you better get ready now, baby
Ready to bleed
(Ready to bleed)
Ready to bleed
