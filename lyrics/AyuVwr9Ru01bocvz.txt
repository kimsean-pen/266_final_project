I killed a man 'cause he killed my goat
I put my hands around his throat
He tried to reason with the sky and the clouds
But it didn't matter, 'cause they can't hear a sound

It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl

Splinters in my skin
Just like needles and pins
I cut through pine
Love the feeling it gives
Been out here for days
Running through these trees
I'm using my hands
Cutting through the disease

It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl

I feel the powerless
Chew it up
Spit out the rest

I feel the powerless
Chew it up
Spit out the rest

It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl
