Have you noticed me lately?
I know I've been vaguely twisting my words
To protect myself from failure
It's just part of my nature to hide in my shell.
I'm so sick of rain in July
And the fact that I'll never get there on time.

If I could show you a sign
And it fell straight from the sky
Could you just see the best in me?
Or find the flaws you detest in me?

I always pictured myself as being someone you'd miss
Somewhere along the line
And I hope that you might think that I was
Some sort of exception to your plans and your direction
But I realized quite soon that who I am bares no reflection to the part of me you held so high.

I'll kick the cans aside and dig in to my pockets
Walk home another night
And think this one over
All over and over again.
I'll just bide my time
Sink into my thoughts to get away from here
Eight weeks to take that drive
And think this one over
All over and over.

I always pictured myself as being someone you'd miss
Somewhere along the line
And I hope that you might think that I was
Some sort of exception to your plans and your direction
But I realized quite soon that who I am bares no reflection to the
Memories that fade, I can stand till my legs break
But you could smile and I fall down walk away and shut me out
When I can't think of shit to say, I pull it out from in my brain
I always had a way with words but they just don't make sense to her

Cross my heart and hope for better days ahead
Get out of this weather
I'm not getting over it, just getting used to this
Over and over and over and over.

Cross my heart and hope for better days ahead
Get out of this weather
I'm not getting over it, just getting used to this
Over and over and over and over.

But I'm just a know it all and she just hates to be wrong
We'll laugh and fight until someone goes along and fucks this whole thing up again
But I'll enjoy the time we spent
Playing with each others heads
Under the premise that we're still friends
