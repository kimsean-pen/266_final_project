I still smell of sweat
Still the scent of my giving in
Tried to feel regret
But I wanted to stay on my skin

I still fantasize
Close my eyes to the wrong again
Still those "fuck me" eyes
As I'm licking the palm of my hand

How the hell am I supposed to keep myself
When you are so damn far away
And everything feels meaningless
And I am not mine

How the hell am I supposed to keep myself
When you are so damn far away
And everything feels meaningless
And I am not mine

I still smell of sex
Still her taste on my fingertips
Try to feel remorse
But it's hard with her wet on my lips

How the hell am I supposed to keep myself
When you are so damn far away
And everything feels meaningless
And I am not mine

How the hell am I supposed to keep myself
When you are so damn far away
And everything feels meaningless
And I am not mine

I need something of my own
Something with a locked door
A room just for me alone
Something that... I... can control

I need something of my own
I need something cutting to the bone
I need something that is mine
If that must be guilt then fine (How the hell)
I wanted something nice and fine
This guilt is a hole but it's mine
I wanted something nice
This guilt is a hole but it's mine
