Do you mean it, more than ever?
Steady, baby, hold the line
You control me, hypnotize
Steady, baby
Hold the line (hold the line)
Hold the line (hold the line)

Cut clean, relieve me
Let free, the vein of my life
No calm, no silence
No control to you, my love

Hold the line, the line
Hold the line

Oh, come clearly, heal my blind eyes
Need you, baby, hold the line

Cut clean, relieve me
Let free, the vein of my life
No calm, no silence
No control to you, my love

Hold the line, the line
Hold the line
Hold the line, the line
Hold the line

You hold it, don't break it
You give it, you take it
I'm a fighter, I'm a lover
I'll be it, forever

You hold it, don't break it
You give it, you take it
I'm a fighter, I'm a lover
I'll be it, forever
Forever, forever, forever
(Hold the line)

Cut clean, relieve me
Let free, the vein of my life
No calm, no silence
No control to you, my love

Hold the line, the line
Hold the line
Hold the line, the line
Hold the line
