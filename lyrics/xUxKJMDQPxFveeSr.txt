Meet me at the back porch
I'd like to get to know you more
Saw that you're good-looking
And maybe it'll be interesting
Me and my friend Apollo
He said that you're from out of state
But I already knew that though
I felt it right away

That you were more like some gypsy lover
I knew from some other place
What you sisters you do not know
What your sister they do not know
I can show you some placed that are gonna be great
Gimme some love gimme some love
Gimme some love c'mon gimme some love

Stab me with your dagger
I knew way in the light
Went up to my mama
She hates you cuz you're beautiful
I'm locked up in my bedroom
I thought this wound would never heal
I'm bustin out the windows though
I got to get away

That you were more like some gypsy lover
I knew from some other place
What your sisters do not know
What your sisters they do not know
I can show you some places that are gonna be great
Gimme some love gimme some love
Gimme some love c'mon gimme some love

Ay baby!
I gotta know
Would you sort through all these seeds for me?
Would you cross over the river to find the golden fleece for me?
Would you fill a flask full of holy water just for me?
Would you go down, down, down, down to the depths of Hades lookin for me?

Cuz you were more like some gypsy lover
I knew From some other place
What your sisters do not know
What your sister they do not know
I can show you some places that are gonna be great
Gimme some love gimme some love
Gimme some love
