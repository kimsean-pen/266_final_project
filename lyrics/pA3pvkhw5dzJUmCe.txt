well I love that kewpie doll
well I love that kewpie doll
well I love that kewpie doll
yeah I bought her in a show
I dressed her up in a cheap red cotton dress
but everything was either fished-out or spat-out
fished-out or spat-out
well I love that kewpie doll
but I could not make it stick
well I love that kewpie doll
but I could not make it stick
only she could save my soul
she put her hands inside of me
well I love that kewpie doll
dressed her in a cheap-red-cotton-dress
fished it out now spat it out now
spat it out in front of me
well I love that kewpie doll
but I could not make it stick
doll doll doll doll doll doll doll doll
I held her in my cheap arms
she believed in me, she believed in me
her soul and my arms
well I love that kewpie doll
I told her phoney stories
well I love that kewpie doll
she believed in me
doll doll doll doll doll doll doll doll
kewpie on a stick
I can see her coming even now
kewpie on a stick
I can see her walking to me even now
well I love that kewpie doll
I can see her walking to me even now
well I love that kewpie doll
I can see her walking to me even now
well I love that kewpie doll
but I could not make it stick. end.
