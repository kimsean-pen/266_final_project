I came home
In the morning
Just a little bit ago

You lie asleep
In our bed
All twisted in your clothes

When the rain came down
Upon our rooftop
With a rhythm like this

Let the hair stand up
On my shoulders
When you open your mouth

Say aaooh
Say aaooh

So I wrote you a letter
Wedged into my forearm
With the pen that you gave me

'Cause if there's one thing that I mustn't face
This is happening
This is happening

Wish that I was strong enough
Wish that I could give it all
Wish that I could change enough
To be yours

Wish that I could give it all
Wish that I was strong enough
Wish that I could change enough
To be yours

Wish that I was strong enough
Wish that I could give it all
Wish that I could change enough
To be yours

Wish that I could give it all
Wish that I could change enough
Wish that I was strong enough
To be yours
