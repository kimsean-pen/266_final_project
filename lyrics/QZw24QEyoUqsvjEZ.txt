Rise

Dark shadows [no shadows] and expectations [no expectations]
Defiance unspoken truth
Doom-filled ignorance and lust
Betrayal of sacred prophecies [proxies]

Invasion of hurt
Penetration of Sensitivity
What are my secret fears
Red is rain of tears

Come back dear dreams
Tales untold [Tales of old]
Endless sleep [In this sleep]
Servant of the warsmen

Rise

Screams of passion through the dark
Ignored by pain and suffering
Gloomy paths decorate the halls [walls] of darkness
Burning hate
Flesh
Heavenlight [Heaven's light; Heavenly light]
Nevermore
Rising conqueror
Forbidden truth
Sanctify my fortress

Come back dear dreams
Tales untold [Tales of old]
Endless sleep [In this sleep]
Servant of the warsmen
