been waiting to see the light
been waiting up all my life
show me your way
wont you show me your way

Dawn
I wanna come out of the dark
but breaking away is so hard
show me your way
just show me your way

show me which way to go
cant do this by myself
cant do this (oh no oh oh no)
dont know how I should bear
the cards that I been dealt
cant do this

Is anyboby listening
can anyboby answer my prayers
please say yes
is anybody feel the same
is there anybody who cares
lifes unfair

Aubrey
i want something more than this
i given all i can give
show me the way

D. Woods
i just wanna feel i belong
i just need the strength to be strong
show me your way
wont you show me your way

show me which way to go
cant do this all alone
i cant do this all alone
dont feel like i know how
to make it on my own

Is anyboby listening
can anyboby answer my prayers
please say yes
does anybody feel the same
is there anybody who cares
lifes unfair

is anybody listening
can you hear me

Is anyboby listening
can anyboby answer my prayers
please say yes
does anybody feel the same
is there anybody who cares
lifes unfair
