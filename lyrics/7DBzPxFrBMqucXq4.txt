You don't care about me anymore
That's why you, you wanna break my heart
Into pieces on the floor

If you don't care about me anymore
Why do you, you wanna break my heart
Into pieces on the floor

You don't care about me anymore
That's why you, you wanna break my heart

I remember when I used to feel sutin'
I remember when I used to feel sutin'
I remember when I used to feel sutin'
I remember when I used to feel sutin'

I remember when I used to feel sutin'
I remember when I used to feel sutin'
I remember when I used to feel sutin'
Now-o-ow-o-ow I'm just cold inside

I remember when I used to feel sutin'
I remember when I used to feel sutin'
I remember when I used to feel sutin'
I remember when I used to feel sutin'

I remember when I used to feel sutin'
I remember when I used to feel sutin'
I remember when I used to feel sutin'
Now-o-ow-o-ow I'm just cold inside

I remember when I used to feel sutin'
Now-o-ow-o-ow I'm just cold inside
I remember when I used to feel sutin'
Now-w-w-w I'm just cold inside

If you don't care about me anymore
Why do you, you wanna break my heart
Into pieces on the floor

You don't care about me anymore
That's why you, you wanna break my heart
