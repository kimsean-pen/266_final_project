I can't stand the rain, against my window
Bringing back, sweet memories
I can't stand the rain, against my window
Cause he ain't here with me
Hey window pane
Tell me, do you remember?
How sweet it used to be
When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that we parted
There's just one sound
That I just can't stand

I can't stand the rain, against my window
Bringing back, sweet memories
I can't stand the rain, against my window
Cause he ain't here with me
When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that we parted
There's just one thing
That I just can't stand
I can't stand the rain (I can't stand the rain, I can't stand the rain)

I can't stand the rain, against my window
Bringing back, sweet memories
I can't stand the rain, against my window
Cause he ain't here with me
When we were together
Everything was so grand
Yeah I know you've got some sweet memories
But there's one sound
That I just can't stand

I can't stand the rain, against my window
Bringing back, sweet memories
I can't stand the rain, against my window
It just keeps on hunting me

Hey, hey rain - get off, of my window
Cause he ain't here with me
And I can't stand the rain, against my window
Bringing back, sweet memories
