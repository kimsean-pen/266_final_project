It feels so right
Now hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Never be the lonely one

So hold me tight
Tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you

Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you

So hold me tight
Tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you

Don't know what it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you
It feels so right

Now hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Never be the lonely one

So hold me tight
Tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you

Don't know what it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you
It feels so right

Now hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you

So hold me tight
Tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you
You
