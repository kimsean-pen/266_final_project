Come to me
Run to me
Do and be done with me
Cold, cold, cold
Don't I exist for you?
Don't I still live for you?
Cold, cold, cold

Everything I possess
Given with tenderness
Wrapped in a ribbon of glass
Time it may take us but God only knows
How I've paid for those things in the past

Dying is easy it's living that scares me to death ooh yeah
I could be so content hearing the sound of your breath ooh yeah
Cold is the colour of crystal the snowlight
That falls from the heavenly skies
Catch me and let me dive under
For I want to swim in the pools of your eyes

I want to be with you baby
Oh oh slip me inside of your heart
Don't I belong to you baby?
Don't you know that nothing can tear us apart?
Come on now, come on now, come on now
Telling you that
I loved you right from the start
But the more I want you the less I get
Ain't that just the way things are? Ooh ooh

Winter has frozen us
Let love take hold of us
(Cold cold cold)
Now we are shivering
Blue ice is glittering
(Cold cold cold)

Cold is the colour of crystal the snowlight
That falls from the heavenly skies
Catch me and let me dive under
For I want to swim in the pools of your eyes

Don't you know it's
Cold, cold, cold
Cold, cold cold
Cold, cold, cold
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Yeah!
