Warm sun, feed me up
And I'm leery, loaded up
Loathing, for a change
And I slip some, boil away

Swallowed, followed
Heavy 'bout everything but my love
Swallowed, sorrowed
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet

Just wanted to be myself
Hey you said you would, love to try some
Hey you said you would love to die some
In the middle of a world on a fishhook

You're the wave
You're the wave
You're the wave

Swallowed, borrowed
Heavy 'bout everything but my love
Swallowed, hollowed
Sharp about everyone but yourself

Swallowed, oh no
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and you're not
I'm with everyone and yet

Piss on, self-esteem
Forward, busted knee
Sick head, blackened lungs
And I'm simple, selfish son

Swallowed, followed
Heavy 'bout everything but my love
Swallowed, oh no
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not

Got to get away from here
Got to get away from here
Got to get away from here
Got to get away from here

Miss the one that I love a lot
I miss the one that I love a lot
I miss the one that I love a lot, a lot
