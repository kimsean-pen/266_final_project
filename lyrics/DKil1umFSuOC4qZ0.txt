My candle burns on both ends so where does it leave us
Standing emptier than we ever left you
With your head in the water its getting harder to breathe
So stand up

It's too late to pry away

Don't get me wrong I'm just as scared as you are now
You dropped us off here with no direction
But you never even tried to fight the current
Watch the water pouring faster into your lungs
So breathe in

But it's hard to hear me when your sinking down here
I wanna see you wash it down

How can you sleep here I bear the weight of your world
I don't believe in a single word you sold to me
I bear your burden for the last time I swear I'm done with all of this
Its too late to pry you away from the undertow
I watch it take you then I walk away
