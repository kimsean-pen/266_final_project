You're sorry now
And you'll change somehow
And I am what you need to get out

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness

No, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness

'Cause I'm crawling back
I'm searchin' the right track
I'm standin' at last, I'm sure

And I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness

No, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness
Oh oh oh oh

Jailbird chained to walk
Since they used to talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
But the melody, none at all my love

And I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness

And no, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness

Oh oh oh oh
Witness, witness
Witty witty witty witty witty witty yeah
Yeah yeah

Please let me out this time
'Cause I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness

No, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness

No, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness

I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna be a witness

I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna be a witness

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness
Oh oh oh oh
Witness
