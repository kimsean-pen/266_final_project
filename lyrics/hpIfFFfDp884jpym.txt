People livin' their lives for you on TV
They say they're better than you and you agree
He says "Hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls"
Says "Come here boy, there ain't nothin' for free"
Another doctor's bill, a lawyer's bill
Another cute cheap thrill
You know you love him if you put him in your will, but

Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers now
Who will save your soul after all the lies that you told, boy
Who will save your soul if you won't save your own?

We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss them
The cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue
Another day, another dollar, another war, another tower
Went up to where the homeless had their homes
So we pray to as many gods are there are flowers
But we call religion our friend
We're so worried about savin' our souls
Afraid that God will take His toll
That we forget to begin

Who will save your soul when it comes to the flower
Who will save your soul after all the lies that you told, boy
Who will save your soul if you won't save your own?
Some are walkin', some are talkin', some are stalkin' their kill
You get social security, but that don't pay your bills
There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay
So you bargain with the Devil, say you're o.k. for today
You say that you love them, take their money and run
Say, it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just one of those things
Those flings, those strings you've got to cut
So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts.
Who will save your soul when it comes to the powers
Who will save your soul after all the lies that you told, boy
Who will save your soul if you won't save your own?
