Freeze, I'm Ma Baker, put your hands in the air
Gimme all your money
This is the story of Ma Baker, the meanest cat
From old Chicago town

She was the meanest cat
In old Chicago town
She was the meanest cat
She really moved them down
She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all

She was the meanest cat
Oh she was realy tough
She left her husband flat
He wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along
'Cause they were mean and strong

Ma Ma Ma Ma
Ma Baker
She taught her four sons
Ma Ma Ma Ma
Ma Baker
To handle their guns
Ma Ma Ma Ma
Ma Baker
She never could cry
Ma Ma Ma Ma
Ma Baker
But she knew how to die

They left a trail of crime
Across the U.S.A.
And when one boy was killed
She really made them pay
She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all

Ma Ma Ma Ma
Ma Baker
She taught her four sons
Ma Ma Ma Ma
Ma Baker
To handle their guns
Ma Ma Ma Ma
Ma Baker
She never could cry
Ma Ma Ma Ma
Ma Baker
But she knew how to die

She met a man she liked
She thought she'd stay with him
One day he formed with them
They did away with him
She didn't care at all
Just didn't care at all

(Here is special bulletin

(Don't anybody move, the money or your lives)

One day they robbed a bank
It was their last hooray
The cops appeared too soon
They couldn't get away
And all the loot they had
It made them mighty mad

And so they shot it out
Ma Baker and her sons
They didn't want to hang
They died with blazing guns
And so the story ends
Of one who left no friends
