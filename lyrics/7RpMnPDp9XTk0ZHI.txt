War-kills on the land
Blood-saturates

Hallowed ground
To which my fathers fell
Rebel souls
Buried deep beneath
This hallowed ground
Land of my ancestry
Drink the blood
Rebel lands rise once again

War-death lingering
Blood rivers flow
In sacrifice

Unholy war
Implored from below
No peace as
Rebel lands arise

Quaking below my feet
Mortals shall suffer defeat
Forgotten evils below
Rejoice as the blood flows
