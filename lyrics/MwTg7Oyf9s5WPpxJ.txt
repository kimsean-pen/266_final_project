It's like the first sign of sun
Since the universe began
We're all throwin off our clothes just to get the perfect tan
Tryin to raise our chances of wild summer romance
Bare feet on the sand with you
See the boys next door, on the way to Magaluf
Matching t-shirts, they're school leavers
It's gonna be off the But I just wanna lay under the northern sky with you
Until our lips turn from red to white to blue
Ooooh Brit Summer!
Ooooh Brit Summer!
Ooooh Brit Summer!
(with you)

Ooooh Brit Summer!
Ooooh Brit Summer!
Ooooh Brit Summer!
(with you)
It's a great British summer
I'll have a great British summer with you

Fresh cut grass, one to a glass on a Sunday afternoon
Sleepin in the sun, turns out lobsters aren't just food

Pack your tent and pack your crate
And a pair of muddy shoes
I'll dance in front of the main stage for you
Ooooh Brit Summer!
Ooooh Brit Summer!
Ooooh Brit Summer!
(with you)

Ooooh Brit Summer!
Ooooh Brit Summer!
Ooooh Brit Summer!
(with you)
I'll have a great British summer with you

I'll be gone gone gone by August

This season is the shortest
Oh oh oh my heart is drawn in the sand
I'll be gone gone gone by August
This season is the shortest
See I wouldn't choose this with anyone else
Ooooh Brit Summer!

Ooooh Brit Summer!
Ooooh Brit Summer!
(with you)
Ooooh Brit Summer!
Ooooh Brit Summer!
Ooooh Brit Summer!
(with you)
It's a great British summer
I'll have a great British summer with you
