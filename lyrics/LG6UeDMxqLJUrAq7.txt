Thank God for the weekend
Now is the time
For feeling alright
Come and taste the spice of life
Tonight nothing matters
Come and feel the groove
Let it in to you!
You know what you gotta do

Every Friday when my work is done I
I get my party on
I call a few friends of mine
Make sure I'm looking fine
I know we're gonna have a real good time
Yeah

Everybody clap your hands
Get on up and dance
We're gonna stomp all night now!
Everybody move your feet
Get up and feel the beat
We're gonna stomp all night now!
All I need is the music

To get me high
Feeling so alive
Leaving all my cares behind
Keep doing your own thing
And I'll be doing mine
Dancing through the night
This is where I feel alright
Every Friday when my work is done I

I get my party on
I call a few friends of mine
Make sure I'm looking fine
I know we're gonna have a real good time
Yeah
Thank God for the weekend

'Cause now is the time

All I need is the music
To get me high
Everybody, everybody yeah
We're gonna stomp all night now
Everybody clap your hands
Get on up and dance
We're gonna, we're gonna
Stomp all night now
Everybody, we're gonna stomp all night
Everybody, and it feels alright
