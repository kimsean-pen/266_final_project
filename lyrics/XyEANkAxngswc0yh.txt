Something's causing fear to fly,
Rising like a dark knight
In silence
Traffic's slow with broken boats
Heading for the sky
And I'm an island

I watched you disappear into the clouds
Swept away into another town

The world carries on without you
But nothing remains the same
I'll be lost without you
Until the last of days

The sun is in the east,
Rising for the beasts

And the beauties
If only I could tear it down,
Plant it in the ground to warm your face

I built myself a castle on the beach
Watching as it slid into the sea

The world carries on without you
But nothing remains the same
I'll be lost without you
Until the last of days
Until the last of days

Through wars and harvest moons
I will wait for you.
The world carries on without you
But nothing remains the same
I'll be lost without you
Until the last of days
Until the last of days
