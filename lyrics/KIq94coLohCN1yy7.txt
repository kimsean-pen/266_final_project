Why, why, why

There you are, in a darkened room
And you're all alone, looking out the window
Your heart is cold and lost the will to love
Like a broken arrow
Here I stand in the shadows
Come to come, come to me
Can't you see that

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry
My body's longing to hold you
So bad it hurts inside
Time is precious and it's slipping away
And I've been waiting for you all of my life
Nobody wants to be lonely
So why, why don't you let me love you

Why, why, why

Can you hear my voice, do you hear my song
It's a seranade, so your heart can find me
And suddenly you're flying down the stairs
Into my arms, baby
Before I start going crazy
Run to me, run to me
Cause I'm dying

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry
My body's longing to hold you
So bad it hurts inside
Time is precious and it's slipping away
And I've been waiting for you all of my life
Nobody wants to be lonely
So why, why, why don't you let me love you

I wanna feel you need me
Feel you need me
Just like the air you're breathing
Breathing, I need you here in my life
Don't walk away, don't walk away
Don't walk alway, don't walk away
No, no, no, no

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry
My body's longing to hold you
So bad it hurts inside
Time is precious and it's slipping away
And I've been waiting for you all of my life
Nobody wants to be lonely
So why, why don't you let me love you
Let me love you
