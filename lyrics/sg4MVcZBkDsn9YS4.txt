Day one the lights fade, the music is full of bass
She's all up in my face, I can't believe she's so close
Feeling her grind made me lose my mind
I'm just plain old take home material, take home material

I keep my fingers crossed
Hoping to find a way to show you what I'm made of
Throw all our worries to the wind

(I backtracked, stabbed at you)
(Followed the tracks to a cabin filled with wooden spoons)
(Then a shred of lead ripped my hoodie in two)
(There's no telling what my evil twin brother wouldn't do)

I wake up drenched in sweat
Wondering who I'm lying with
What a joke there's nothing left to explore

Find myself at the end of a bottle
Laying in your bed hoping to find out where I'm at (The weight can make you trip, but you won't fall down)
It's gone away my song, so long
(The weight can make you trip, but you won't fall down)

(Accept fresh, fresh can of broccoli)
(I can't hear when you are knocking)
(Unless fresh, fresh can of broc')
(I'll be leaning towards a centimeter short of much)

(Accept fresh, fresh can of broccoli)
(I can't hear when you are knocking)
(Unless fresh, fresh can of broc')
(I'll be leaning towards a centimeter short of much)

As the sun goes down, baby, I'm in town
Hoping to find someone to take it all
I know I'm right when I say, "Go away"
You get around, oh, you get around, oh
You get around, oh, you're busy fucking everyone
Busy fucking everyone
Oh, you're busy fucking everyone

Find myself at the end of a bottle
Laying in your bed hoping to find out where I'm at (The weight can make you trip, but you won't fall down)
It's gone away my song, so long
(The weight can make you trip, but you won't fall down)

Feeling my heart race
Drenched in sweat
As I wonder
I'm not scared, not prepared
Lay down flat on your back
Open up girl, let's play attack
Let's waste our time

(Back on top, but my blocks mowed down)
(Man, I'm fit)
(Yeah my stomachs never touched the ground)
(But I'm courteous)
(Still keep it real with my nerdyness)
(14th's my birthday)
(Hers is on the 30th)
(If you were dead, I bet this shit would bloom)
(Get a standing ovation from an empty room)
(Fuck your ass)
(I don't want your cereal)
(You can get your wig split back)
(I'll be the same ol' G)
