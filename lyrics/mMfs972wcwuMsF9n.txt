You're so hard to read
You're the master of disguise

In your old blue jeans
You give me truth; you give me lies
You're a mystery, but it's exactly what I like
What I like

I can't pin you down
You're like catching open air

You make me laugh out loud, lying in your underwear
On your leather couch --I just wanna keep you there
Keep you there
All the voices in my head
Are pushing me right to the edge
If this is real love
Beatin'-like-a-thousand-drums love
Burnin'-like-the-hottest-sun love
You're the only one I want

I want, I want real love
Hit-me-like-a-hurricane love
Feel-you-runnin'-through-my-veins love

You're the only one I want

Want, want, want
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Real love, real love
All the little things --it's the smell of your cologne

Lying next to me, I breathe you in when I'm at home
Give me everything, I'm not afraid of the unknown
Of the unknown
All the voices in my head
Are pushing me right to the edge
If this is real love
Beatin'-like-a-thousand-drums love
Burnin'-like-the-hottest-sun love
You're the only one I want

I want, I want real love
Hit-me-like-a-hurricane love
Feel-you-runnin'-through-my-veins love
You're the only one I want
Want, want, want
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Real love, real love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Real love, real love
I'm not scared of much
Take the pleasure with the pain
Do it all for us

Won't you meet me there halfway?
Don't be scared of love
Take the sunshine with the rain
Do it all for us
Do it all for us
If this is real love
Beatin'-like-a-thousand-drums love
Burnin'-like-the-hottest-sun love
You're the only one I want

I want, I want real love
Hit-me-like-a-hurricane love
Feel-you-runnin'-through-my-veins love
You're the only one I want
Want, want, want
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (real love)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (real love)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (real love)
Real love, real love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (real love)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (real love)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (real love)
Real love, real love (oooh!)
