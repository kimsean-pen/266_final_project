Back... seat

Born brave, need no help, never seemed so sane talk dreams don't help,
Thoughts chase and they seep so well and a place in space only she can tell
And there's no string, floating, close to eloping, lovers under the covers is roasting,
Kids at the front if they had three wishes, would give it all up for the backseat kissers

Backseat kissers

Come on, back then, backs them, back chat
Bad at can't catch when I'm sat back easily pleased,
Never leave it be, no secrecy, they speak so free so easily
In the haze of their lover's lights, dazed for another night,
Chasing rays to be raised to the upper heights,
Spaced out rubbin' eyes, taste town oven fries, come let's run, let's race to the other side
Lock it like sky so it keeps 'em on top, in love with the white line flee from the cops,
Try fly might die might equally yacht might ride sky high what reason you got?

One time for the city, and two times for us
