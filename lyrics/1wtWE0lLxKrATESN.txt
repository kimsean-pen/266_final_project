Now that time has past
I can see things through
My hands untied, my heart unglued
You'll find your place I'll find mine too
In another life, a different point of view
I wish that I could have helped you
(I could've helped you)
I'm sorry that you didn't want me to
(You didn't want me to)
Oh, where have the months gone?
(Where have they gone?)

Dying inside, slowly day by day
This was the only way for us to make a change
So we hold our heads underwater, and scream that we should stay
Take a deep breath, as I float away

And I swear I looked up, I caught a glimpse of someone I knew
But did I make believe it? Believed it
I believed it was you
And I know I moved on, we cut ties and we both grew
So why do I believe it? Believed it
I believed it was you

So many years lost, because you won't admit your faults
I'm withered by your dismay
It won't just work out one day
Are you happy without me?
I took comfort in solitude
Can things just work out one day?
That sinking feeling takes everything
Can things just work out one day?

And I swear I looked up, I caught a glimpse of someone I knew
But did I make believe it? Believed it
I believed it was you
And I know I moved on, we cut ties and we both grew
So why do I believe it? Believed it
I believed it was you

(Can things just work out one day?)
That sinking feeling takes everything
Are you happy
(Can things just work out one day?)
Without me?

And I swear I looked up, I caught a glimpse of someone I knew
But did I make believe it? Believed it
Believed it was you
And I know we moved on, cut ties and we both grew
So why do I believe it? Believed it
Believed it was you

And I know we moved on, cut ties and we both grew
Did I make believe it? Believed it
Believed it was you
And I know, I believe it
I believed it was you
