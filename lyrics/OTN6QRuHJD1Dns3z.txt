Today I am stitched up and sewn
Catch me up, I got warmth in my bones
Locks 'em down you know you could throw away
I found my legs

Ready to climb out from under concrete
Only I get to be sickened by me
My body is merged
Can't make out the details
Why start over, give it to me

Exhume our idols and bury our friends
We're wild and weary but we won't give in
We're sick with worry
These nervous days
We live on dread in our own guilded age

This dark world is precious to me
My scars make me breathe in so deep
My body has no need for sleep
This time around

Ready to fight, fight makes the stillness
Only I get to be punched by me
Your voice is a crumb it leads me from the wildness
Why start over, forget everything

Exhume our idols and bury our friends
We're wild and weary but we won't give in
We're sick with worry
These nervous days
We live on dread in our own guilded age

Make me a headline
I wanna be that bold
Make me a spotlight
So I can see the gold

Make me a headline
I wanna feel that bold
Make me a spotlight
So I can see the gold

Exhume our idols and bury our friends
We're wild and weary but we won't give in
We're sick with worry
These nervous days
We live on dread in our own guilded age

We speak in circles
We dance in code
Untamed and hungry
On fire and in cold
Exhume our idols and bury our friends
We're wild and weary but we won't give in
