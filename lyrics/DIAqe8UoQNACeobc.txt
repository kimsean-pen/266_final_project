Do you believe in magic
In a young girl's heart?
How the music can free her
Whenever it starts
And it's magic
If the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy
Like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic
And it'll free your soul
But it's like tryin' to tell a stranger 'bout-a
Rock 'n' roll

If you believe in magic
Don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music
Or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen
It'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face
No matter how hard you try
Your feet start tappin'
And you can't seem to find
How you got there
So just blow your mind

If you believe in magic
Come along with me
We'll dance until mornin'
'Til there's just you and me
And maybe
If the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow
Sort of late at night
And we'll go dancin'
Baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music
And the music's in me

Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock 'n' roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ahh, talkin' 'bout the magic

(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe, believer?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
