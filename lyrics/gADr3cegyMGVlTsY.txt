My bedroom is a disaster
My dog has god kidney failure, failure
I've been sitting at the bar too much
Kissin' people in my head
And saying rubbish things I should not have said

And they're building things outside my window
Everywhere I look there's signposts, signposts
I just sit in my house making noise for fun
And I'm not moving much or proving much to anyone

I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost for a while
And I'm feeling tired

I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost for a while

And I spend so much time eating pasta
Although I'm probably allergic and other
People seem to move so much faster
I wonder why I'm feeling lonely
When there's plenty of ways to be alone
I guess I spent all of yesterday on my phone

I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost for a while
And I'm feeling tired

I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost for a while

Now I am simultaneously on top of someone's pedestal
And also underneath someone else's shoe
Oh, isn't it a shame about the view?
Can anybody climb aboard this structure I have made to
Wrap myself around the promise that there is room?
Oh, isn't it a shame about the view?

I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost for a while
And now I'm feeling tired

I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost for a while
But now I'm really trying

I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost for a while
But I'm really trying

I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost for a while
