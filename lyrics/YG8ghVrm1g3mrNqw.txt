Life so sacred yet here I stand
Cursed with sorrow and a penchant for death
May I enter the void of loss
In the presence of those whom have perished

As I enter the chasm of emptiness
The mythos tells no lies
Mournful spirits fill the air
Lingering amongst the dead

In the labyrinth of terrifying fear
The winds sweep across the trees
Pulling me into their lair
Filled with troubled thoughts of death

The forest of broken dreams and shattered lives
Upon the sea of trees
Lies the depth of all our sorrows

Nothingness of being
I am only a shadow of what was I
Nothing, nothing but a shell left as I

Shunned by the light of the sun
In the realm of hazy dense despair
What sadness lies before me
Awaiting the ghosts of those left to die

As I enter this majestic sprawl
Banished, never to return again
Vengeful thoughts and woeful wounds
An absolute end

In the maze lost upon volcanic rock
Where the veils are transparent
Vestiges of a culture unknown
The universe within us all

The forest of broken dreams and shattered lives
Upon the sea of trees
Lies the depth of all our sorrows

Nothingness of being
I am only a shadow of what was I
Nothing, nothing but a shell left as I

Wounds that no one can heal
Pain that never subsides
Scars... scars that never shall fade

Shall the spirit of the winds engulf me
May the ghosts of the past resolve
May I leave this world behind
In the shadows of yurei absolve

Nothing, nothing but a shell left as I
Nothing, nothing but a shell left as I.
