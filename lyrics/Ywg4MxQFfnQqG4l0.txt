People say that I'm insane
A victim of society just in pain
Society's rules have made me cruel
I'm just the opposite, ain't no fool
The way I act or way I dress
Doesn't make me strong or make me best
Soon they'll find my reasons why
I'm open minded and not blind

But why am I going insane
Why am I the one to blame

Open your eyes, don't tell me lies
I'll be the one to live and rise
I'll think for myself and I'm sure to find
That society's rules won't change my mind
