I was a rich man, I was a poor man,
but now I'll never know
They're ringing surgeons,
my eyes have been worthless
And now I'll never see you!
Uh, uh, uh
I'm bringing riches, my eyes are worthless
I still look back and see you...
She was my. she was my other
But now I'll never know, I'm in the dark!
Uh, uh, uh, uh!
