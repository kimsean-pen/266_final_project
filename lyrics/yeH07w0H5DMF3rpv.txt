I'm sorry that it took so long
to write this song
But I gave up
You see, one million words can't describe how it feels
To know your love

Where did I go wrong?
I should have told you from the start
That I'm closer than you think when we're apart
Nothing that I've tried is as simple as this line
Without you my life is incomplete
My days are absolutely gray
And so I try to let your heart know for sure

That I have so much more
To tell you every single day
I swear I'm giving up my inside to the one
That I adore
I know this world is big enough for you and I

But I'll give you more
I'm coming home today
to wipe the tear drops from your eyes
I'm totally enamored by your life

Nothing that I've done
has ever been for one
Without you my life is incomplete
My days are absolutely gray

And so I try to let your heart know for sure
That I have so much more
To tell you every single day
My life is incomplete
My rights are absolutely wrong
So wake me up before you leave today
Something I need to say
'cause there will be nothing when
You're gone
