What's a matter with going places?
Take that gross look off your faces
Empty loving makes me seasick
What you're here for, I don't need it

I'll say nothing on your microphone
Till you swear to take me home
There's a one foot boy, eleven stone
Sitting on my shoulder

I'm too scared to look away
He comes here almost everyday
And everyday I push him off
And tell him: "Boy, we're over!"

My oh my, I think my mind is gone
I'm left here wondering, was I crazy all along?
What do I do? Nothing left but pray
Gonna shoot somebody, help me drive this craziness away

I'm happy on my own

One foot boy, one foot boy
One foot boy, one foot boy
One foot boy, one foot boy
One foot boy, one foot boy

Say you like me, not with changes
Shut up and forget it, these are my faces
All these colours that surround me
All these places only drown me

I'll say nothing on your microphone
Till you swear to take me home
There's a one foot boy, eleven stone
Sitting on my shoulder

I'm too scared to look away
He comes here almost everyday
And everyday I push him off
And tell him: "Boy, we're over!"

My oh my, I think my mind is gone
I'm left here wondering, was I crazy all along?
What do I do? Nothing left but pray
Gonna shoot somebody, help me drive this craziness away

I'm happy on my own

I think my mind is gone
I'm left here wondering, was I crazy all along?
What do I do? Nothing left but pray
Gonna shoot somebody, help me drive this craziness away

I'm happy on my own

What's a matter with going places?
Take that gross look off your faces
Empty loving makes me seasick
What you're here for, I don't need it

One foot boy, one foot boy
One foot boy, one foot boy
One foot boy, one foot boy
One foot boy, one foot boy

I'm happy on my own
