What are the things you wanted?
The same as anyone?
Just a hand to hold a little
After all is said and done
And the days were long and open
'Cause I had a view of you
The summer of '42
When I was in love with you

We counted stars above us
We dreamed of Xanadu
We'd sneak off to the desert
The sand over your fancy shoes
The first day that I met you
I wrote down in my book

I am in love with you
I am in love with you
You
I am in love with you
You
I am in love with you
I'm in love with you

The days have gone asunder
The chaos of the war
Made men of everybody
But our memories I adore
We named our favorite sunset
But I remember very few
The summer of '42
When I was in love with you

But years have turned to ages
And I know you've someone new
I looked for you with every breath
A soldier wrecked with solitude
I climbed to the highest mountain
And I shouted to our view

I was in love with you
I was in love with you
You
I was in love with you
In love with you

You
I am in love with you
You
I am in love with you
I am in love with you
You
I am in love with you
You
I am in love with you
I am in love with you
You
I am in love with you
You
I am in love with you
I am in love with you
You
I am in love with you
