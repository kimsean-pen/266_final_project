Fires rise from burning shells of what once used to be
On cobalt streets temptation sparks like electricity
Born of man and of machine, these two worlds hybridize
Truth and lie, amplify and rage behind my eyes

Agony, Wrong and right
All I see, Black and white
Calling me, Dark and Light
Who's the enemy?

Seen by the unforeseen
The pressure building in between
Can someone help me choose between
The Darkness and the Light

Can someone help me choose between
The Darkness and the Light
