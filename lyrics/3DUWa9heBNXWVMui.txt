I spend my life
Becoming invisible
It's hard to maintain
And it's hard to get by
I don't recall
Fight or flight setting in
I have no introduction
I just breath it in like the air
And theres nothing to remember
There is nothing to remember

I owe you nothing
That's all I've got for you
And you'll borrow nothing
That's what you expect of me

So send me a lot
Out of thin sailors knots
And I fear underneath
Your radiant thoughts
My footsteps now
They will echo loudly

All I owe, all I owe
Strides I spend to the finish line
All I owe, all I owe
Strides I spend to the finish line
I'll give you those

You told me something
That scared me to death
Don't take me home
I can't face that yet
I'm ashamed that I'm barely human
And I'm ashamed that
I don't have a heart you can break

I'm just action
And at other times reaction
All I owe, all I owe
Strides I spend to the finish line
All I owe, all I owe
Strides I spend to the finish line
I'll give you those

Just don't make me go home
Give me something to remember
Give me something to remember
Give me something to remember
