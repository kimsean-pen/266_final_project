Well I can show you how it is done
There's no competitors
Time to say goodbye to the sun
It takes a better turn
Wake up, it's not your typical rehash
Something unpredictable
Do you really know that?
I will remember this one
I'm just on pure momentum
Rock out and break up your own suppression
I like to see you having fun
In the setting sun

Sunset in July
Rockers by my side and time is flying by
ba da dop dop da dee-yah
Watching you dancing and having the time of your life
And it's getting me high
Time is flying by
Whoa oh-oh-oh

January, February, March into May
Here's June with a tune just to brighten my day
Sunsetting in July I'm gonna fade 'em away
Cuz time is sliding, time is sliding on hear what I say
If you believe that, believe that
Back-up, back-up you need that, need that
Space and time and time and space is my way
I'm forever in existence, I'm forever ok

Sunset in July
Rockers by my side and time is flying by
ba da dop dop da dee-yah
Watching you dancing and having the time of your life
And it's getting me high
Time is flying by
Whoa-oh-oh

The time of our lives
Here, I was happy
The days flying by
Come closer to me
I could never knock out all the things that you given
Throughout the multiverse bout anything could be true
Might as well make up anything to believe in
It's made inside of you

Sunset in July
Rockers by my side and time is flying by
ba da dop dop da dee-yah
Watching you dancing and having the time of your life
And it's getting me high
Time is flying by
Whoa-oh-oh

Watching you dancing and having the time of your life
And it's getting me high
Time is flying by
Whoa oh-oh-oh
