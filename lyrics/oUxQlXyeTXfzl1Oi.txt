I, I see turns you never take
You never take
Don't cancel out, don't stop
Don't wait

Pull yourself together
Take everything you need
Open up to open arms
And not to disagree
Pull yourself together
Pull yourself together, for me

Everyone, everyone is waiting for you
Waiting for you
From the other end, to the ends
You belong too

So pull yourself together
Take everything you need
Open up to open arms
And not to disagree
Pull yourself together
Pull yourself together, for me

So pull yourself together
Pull yourself together
Open up to open arms
And not to disagree
Pull yourself together
Pull yourself together, for me
