I'm getting a little tired of your broken promises, promises
Looking at your pager seeing different numbers and numbers
Call you on your cell you' hangin with the fellas the fellas
Hanging with my girls you always getting jealous n' jealous
I was with you when you had no dollas no dollas
Hangin at the crib chillin' with yo mamma yo mamma
Never fronted you never brought the drama the drama
Now you flip the script player please

No I'm not the one
(Say it again, Say it again oh)
No I'm not the one
(You do or you don't)

You do or you don't don't
You will or you won't won't
No more, No more baby I'ma do right
You can or you can't can't
Be a man, be a man man
No more, no more baby I'ma do right

You treat me like a lady when you open doors n' doors
But then you wanna front when you with yo boys yo boys
How you gonna play me when I bought yo clothes yo clothes
The ones that you been wearing when yo with yo dogs, yo dogs
I know you never thought that I would have the nerve the nerve
So think about it more, since you at the curb the curb
Blowin' up my pager, say you want a chance a chance
Listen when I say player please

You do or you don't don't
You will or you won't won't
No more, No more baby I'ma do right
You can or you can't can't
Be a man, be a man man
No more, no more baby I'ma do right

No, I'm not the one
(Baby, I'mma do right, do right)
No, I'm not the one
(Baby, I'mma do right, do right)
No, I'm not the one
(Baby, I'mma do right, do right)
No, I'm not the one
(Baby, I'mma do right)

I just wanna know, what happened to our love
We used to be best friends
Where did it go wrong

When ya gonna see, How good it is with me
I'm tired and I'm through with all you listen baby

And yo you promised me a Kate Spade
But that was last year boy in the 8th grade
And you ain't biggie baby boy
So no it ain't one more chance
When you friends around you don't want to hold my hand
And now you see a girl stylin and whilin inside the mix
Hopping out the whips the whips the 5 or 6

Yes fly chrome so pardon my tone
Here go a quarter go call Tyrone

You do or you don't don't
You will or you won't won't
No more, No more baby I'ma do right
You can or you can't can't

Baby be a man, baby be a man man
No more, no more baby I'ma do right
No, I'm not the one
(Say it again, s-say it, say it again)
No, I'm not the one
(Say it again, s-say it, say it again)
No, I'm not the one
(I could do bad all by myself)

No, I'm not the one
(I'm not the one, the one)
No, I'm not the one
(Say it again, s-say it, say it again)
No, I'm not the one
(Say it again, s-say it, say it again)
No, I'm not the one
(I could do bad all by myself)
No, I'm not the one
(I'm not the one, the one)

You do or you don't don't
You will or you won't won't
No more, No more baby I'ma do right
You can or you can't can't
Be a man, be a man man
No more, no more baby I'ma do right
