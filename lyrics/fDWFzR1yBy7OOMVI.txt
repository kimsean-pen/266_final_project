Close my eyes, I can still hear your whisper
And the music as we danced
Golden days, feel like they'd last forever
When the sunset was in our hands

Nights getting colder, now we're far apart
I wish you were here, baby, still in my arms

Summer has faded so fast
The feelings we had couldn't last
The passion, the fire...
But we knew that the end had begun

Those autumn winds couldn't wait
They took you so far and away
But just for a moment, yeah, we had it all
Now it's gone, like the September sun

Close your eyes, tell me, do you remember
When we made out in the sand?
Always knew, yeah, we'd have to surrender
We were dreaming in wonderland

Nights getting colder and now we're apart
I wish you were here in my arms

Summer has faded so fast
The feelings we had couldn't last
The passion, the fire...
But we knew that the end had begun

(Those autumn winds)
Those autumn winds couldn't wait
(We had nowhere to hide)
They took you so far and away
(So deep into the night)
But just for a moment, yeah, we had it all
Now it's gone, like the September sun

It vanished just quick as it came
But it blinded my eyes
Oh, why do I still feel the same?
It all seems like so long ago
Just a moment in time
And if I could hold you again...

Summer has faded so fast
The feelings we had couldn't last
The passion, the fire...
But we knew that the end had begun

(Those autumn winds)
Those autumn winds couldn't wait
(We had nowhere to hide)
They took you so far and away
(So deep into the night)
But just for a moment, yeah, we had it all
Now it's gone, like the September sun

Summer, it went so fast
Feelings we couldn't last
Although a fire burned, the end had begun
Cold winds, they couldn't wait
Took you so far away
And now you're gone, like the September sun
