I fill these bones, with hollow promises
I can feel the world outside under my skin
And all these walls, are slowly caving in
I would climb if I could find my way again

It feels so close, yet so far gone
It feels so close, but still...

I'm looking for a sign of life, behind the sky
Is anybody there?
Does anybody care?
A sign of life to redefine
Is anybody there?
'Cause I just need a sign of life

Can I go on, a loss without a trace?
Am I afraid to hold the light and lead the way?
I may be wrong, another face without a name
But I'm alive and I can see I'm not the same

It feels so close, yet so gone
It feels so close, but still...

I'm looking for a sign of life, behind the sky
Is anybody there?
Does anybody care?
A sign of life to redefine
Is anybody there?
I'm fighting for a sign of life

Woah, woah
Woah, woah

I'm looking for a way out, 'cause I'm way out and I'm on my own
I'm looking for a way out, 'cause I'm way out and I'm on my own
I'm looking for a way out, 'cause I'm way out and I'm on my own
I'm looking for a way out, 'cause I'm way out and I'm on my own

I'm looking for a way out, 'cause I'm way out
I'm looking for a sign of life behind our eyes
Is anybody there?
Does anybody care?
A sign of life to redefine
Is anybody there?
Does anybody care?
A sign of life behind our eyes
Is anybody there?
I'm fighting for a sign of life

A sign, a sign (woah)
A sign, a sign (woah)
