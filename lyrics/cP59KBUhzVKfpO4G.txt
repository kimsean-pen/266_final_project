I know a place that I wanna go
Could you just stay by my side?
It'll be alright
I want a taste of the other side
Baby just give me some time
To make it right

I wanna go, I wanna fly
I wanna take myself to a new sky
I wanna live, I wanna die
I wanna thank myself for getting out
Take me to another place
Take me to another place

I know a place that I wanna fly
Could you just open your eyes
And free your mind
I wanna face what I haven't tried
Baby just took me some time
To realize

I wanna go, I wanna fly
I wanna take myself to a new sky
I wanna live, I wanna die
I wanna thank myself for getting out
Take me to another place
Take me to another place
Take me to another place
Take me to another place
Take me to another place

I know a place, that I wanna go
