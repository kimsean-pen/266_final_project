Those school girl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind I know they still live on and on
But how do you thank someone
who was taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy but I'll try
If you wanted the sky
I'd write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To sir with love
The time has come
For closing books, and long last looks must end
And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong, that's a lot to learn
What can I give you in return
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start but I
Would rather you let give my heart
To sir with love
