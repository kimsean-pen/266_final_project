I'm restless
I'm older
I'm heavy
Like a stone

Forgiven, foresaken
I'm searing
At my pores

Die
For the stone
For the stone
For the stone
I can't die for the stone
For the stone

He wants to have my glorious
He wants to have my glorious
He wants to have my glorious

I am restless
And I'm older
And I'm heavy
Like a stone

Stone
Stone
Stone
Stone
