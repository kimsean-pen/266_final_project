Should I write myself
Out of the history books
& mark a place in time
For every chance you took

Don't get me wrong
I know you've got your life in place
I've yet to take the hint some day
I'm sure I'll get the picture

& stop waiting up
When it all comes down
To a sunrise on the east side

Will you be there to carry home?
The remains of my wasted youth
This wasted time on you has left me

Shaking in waiting
Shaking in waiting for something more
Tonight is alive with the promise of a street fight

& there's money on the table
Says your cheap shots won't be able to break bones
I've yet to break a sweat

I'll make your past regret
It's future
Here's to you

When it all comes down
To a sunrise on the east side
Will you be there to carry home?

The remains of my wasted youth
This wasted time on you has left me
Shaking in waiting for something more
Make all of my

Decisions for me
I've never taken the fall for deceit
I'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like

Make all of my
Dcisions for me
I've never taken the fall for deceit
I'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing

The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like this
I can keep a secret
If you can keep me guessing
The flavor of your lips

Is enough to keep me pressing
For more than just a moment of truth
Between the lies told
To pull ourselves away
From the lives we leave back
The flavor of your lips
Is enough to keep me here, keep me here
When it all comes down
To a sunrise on the east side
Will you be there to carry me home?
The remains of my wasted youth
This wasted time on you has left me
Shaking in waiting for something more
