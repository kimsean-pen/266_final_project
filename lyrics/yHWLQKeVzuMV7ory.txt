Now you've found the way to the end of your time
Your light is born once again
And your mind unwinds, finding the truth to be kind

Call your friends, they're hiding in darkness
You call again and fight through the silence
And raise your eyes, only way to survive

In but a dream
In but a dream, yeah
In but a dream
In but a dream, yeah

Love you've found, it's this tenderness
It is all you need
It speaks through the trees
And your sighs describe only a moment in time

Oh, love again, she's helping you live on until the end while holding your hand
Now realise your dreams are built from the way that you see, yeah

In but a dream
In but a dream, yeah
In but a dream
In but a dream, yeah

I can feel the weight inside
It's weighing down on my life
No one helped me like you did then
In but a dream
In but a dream, yeah
In but a dream
In but a dream, yeah
In but a dream
In but a dream, yeah
In but a dream
In but a dream, yeah

In but a dream
In but a dream, yeah
In but a dream
In but a dream, yeah
