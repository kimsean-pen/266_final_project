I remember those times
I felt like I been dreaming
Found someone who saw something
That I thought I been seeing
But clouds started appearing
I can feel the rumbling
I can feel the reeling

Trouble in paradise
Trouble in paradise
I think I need a break from the rules that you make
I think I need a break from the rules, from the rules
From the rules that you make

I tried to run but you'd find me
Every way you kept by me
I just don't understand that we got so lost
So far from the real deal
But I was hoping we'd be a thing
I was praying we'd keep sane
But bright turned to black and I saw

Trouble in paradise
Trouble in paradise
I think I need a break from the rules that you make
I think I need a break from the rules, from the rules
Trouble in paradise
Trouble in paradise
I think I need a break from the rules that you make
I think I need a break from the rules, from the rules
From the rules that you make

Finally you saw lightning, struck your heart with those white beams
You were laughing, now you were lashing out
Now you were saying the right things
But you can be wrong, you can be wrong
Finally you saw lightning, struck your heart with those white beams
You were laughing, now you were lashing out
Now you were saying the right things
But you can be wrong, you can be wrong

Trouble in paradise
Trouble in paradise
I think I need a break from the rules that you make
I think I need a break from the rules, from the rules
Trouble in paradise
Trouble in paradise
I think I need a break from the rules that you make
I think I need a break from the rules, from the rules
From the rules that you make
