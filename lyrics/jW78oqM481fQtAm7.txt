High tide, mid afternoon
People fly by in the traffics boom
Knowing just where you're blowing
Getting to where you should be going

Don't let them get you down
Making you feel guilty about
Golden rain will bring you riches
All the good things you deserve now, right now

Climbing, forever trying
Find your way out of the wild, wild wood
Now there's no justice
There's only yourself that you can trust in

And I said high tide, mid afternoon
Oh, people fly by in the traffics boom
Oh, knowing just where you're blowing
Getting to where you should be going

Day by day your world fades away
Waiting to feel all the dreams that say
Golden rain will bring you riches
All the good things you deserve now

And I said climbing, forever trying
You're gonna find your way out
Of the wild, wild wood
Said you're gonna find your way out
Of the wild wild wood
Of the wild wild wood
