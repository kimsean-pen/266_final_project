Tell me, could you love me like you used to do?
Tell me, are you still the one I've held on to?
How to do the right thing

Did you find your passion, did you fall in love?
I don't wanna ruin something you build up
It's driving me crazy, and I don't know how

Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
Do you remember chasing fireflies?
You showed me how to make 'em glow-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
When I was young and too afraid to let you know

You could take me anywhere
I would follow anywhere

Been thinking 'bout how your life turned out for you
Did you get away, did all your dreams come true?
Do you ever miss me, boy, like I miss you?
Tell me how to do the right thing

Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
Do you remember chasing fireflies?
We went in hiding, do you know
That I'm so glad you went and gave me my first kiss?

You could take me anywhere
I would follow anywhere
You could take me anywhere
I would follow anywhere

We were making memories
Long before we knew we'd be
We were making memories
Long before we knew

You could take me anywhere, yeah
I would follow anywhere

You could take me anywhere
Anywhere you want to
