"Don't interupt me man, I'm getting real impatient"
She said, "Why don't you put that one in a history-book poem so I can hate it."
I really want an official copy of that statement

I never met anyone who wanted
so badly to be hated
You're like Ketamine
You get me so sedated

And all those hate-filled blogs that I know are all about me
And to be honest, true
They're getting pretty mean

Well I'm good at avoiding things and bleeding into the scenery
When you were drunk, trying to get balance
I'm an adult but then I saw your matress
Gonna make you feel like a slow dance
Tryna make you feel like romance
While I had another number written in the palm of my hand

Well I'm trying to be honest
Now you're calling me out on it
Now you're calling all my friends askin'
Where is Drew Thompson

If they knew, they'd tell you,
But what that really means is "get a clue"

I'm an adult but then I saw your matress
Gonna make you feel like a slow dance
Tryna make you feel like romance

I saw a picture of your boyfriend on the nightstand
