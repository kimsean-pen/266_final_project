Kiss the moon goodbye
But don't close your eyes, your eyes
It's the end of the night
But the beginning of time for you and I

I can't believe that my body is still moving, I
It makes me feel like we're doing something right

Baby, when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy, you keep my heartbeat skipping when you touch me
Even though the time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
Oh, when the night starts slipping away
Save the day

D-d-d-d-d-d-day, d-d-d-d-d-d-day
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, oh
Save the day
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, d-d-d-d-d-d-day
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, oh
Save the day

Yeah, we're still wide awake
Got me losing my mind, my mind
No, it's never too late
Put your lips on mine in the burning sunlight, I

I can't believe that my body is still moving, I
It makes me feel like we're doing something right

Baby, when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy, you keep my heartbeat skipping when you touch me
Even though the time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
Oh, when the night starts slipping away
Save the day

D-d-d-d-d-d-day, d-d-d-d-d-d-day
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, oh
Save the day
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, d-d-d-d-d-d-day
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, oh
Save the day

Eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh, ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
Eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh, ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
Eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh

Kiss the moon goodbye
But don't close your eyes, eyes, eyes

Baby, when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy, you keep my heartbeat skipping when you touch me
Even though the time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
Oh, when the night starts slipping away
Save the day

D-d-d-d-d-d-day, d-d-d-d-d-d-day
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, oh
Save the day
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, d-d-d-d-d-d-day
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, oh
Save the day
