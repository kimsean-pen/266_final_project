Boy, you know that you drive me crazy
But it's one of the things I like
Cause I know when you need it, baby

Let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talking
But it don't matter what they say
Cause you know when you hear me knocking
Gonna get that, ooh ooh

I been doing stupid things
Wilder than I've ever been
You've become my favorite since
So let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talking
That's right

We got that hood love
We got that good love
We got that hot love
We got that I don't give a what love
We got that one life
Give me that all night

They say it's wrong
But that's the way you turn me on
We got that hood love

Boy, you make me make bad decisions
Bad, boy, you make me make bad decisions

No, they ain't gonna understand it
Understand what I see in you
Better know when you touch my body

Cause I know that I got someone
Anytime that I need some danger
Gonna get that, ooh ooh
