Take me away from the ocean already gone away, I'm already gone.

Take me up North to the bluegrass, horse meat and pharmacies, I'm already gone.

Board up the house, hide your boys and girls.
Board up the house, hide your boys and girls.

We wanted the best for our sweet little September castaway, I'm already gone.

She's floating in acid still covered in bruises and common colds, I'm already gone.

Board up the house, hide your boys and girls.
Board up the house, hide your boys and girls.

Board up the house,
Board up the house,
Board up the house,
Board up the house,

Board up

Hide your boys and hide your girls and hide your.
