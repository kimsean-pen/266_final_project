A man, a man, a man don't take my soul
A man, a man, a man don't take my soul

I could see you won't admit
That this romance disappointing too
I could see you won't admit
There's no mess, maybe it's just you

When I think I'm falling to pieces
Yes, I know what to do
And with a single itch and part of me says yes
I know what to do

A man, a man, a man don't take my soul
A man, a man, a man don't take my soul

I could see you wanted to be something else
It's from what you should do
When I think I'm falling to pieces
Yes, should've had enough to do

And with a single itch and part of me says yes
I know what to do
And with a single itch and part of me says yes
It's just haunting you

A man, a man, a man don't take my soul
A man, a man, a man don't take my soul

I could feel the war in it
Of this romance turning into a fued
Consumation's falling to pieces
And creep into the rules
Is it the same position? The heart of me says yes
I know what to do
Come to think, she won't admit and yet
Maybe it's just you

A man, a man, a man don't take my soul
A man, a man, a man don't take my soul

A man, a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, a man

A man, a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, a man
