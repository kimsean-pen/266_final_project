My boat's capsized, it's gonna sink to the bottom
I can see the lights on the shore getting farther away

I don't know if I'll make it home tonight
But I know I can swim under the Tahitian moon

I came out here tonight to look for my friend
I don't know if I'll ever get to see him again

I don't know if I'll make it home tonight
But I know I can swim under the Tahitian moon
One last time under the Tahitian moon

The sea is a very easy place to disappear
Drift away, fall asleep or make your peace

I came out here tonight to look for my friend
I don't know if I'll ever get to see him again

I don't know if I'll make it home tonight
But I know I can swim under the Tahitian moon
I can swim under the Tahitian moon
I can swim under the Tahitian moon
I can swim under the Tahitian moon
I can swim
