Clever liar, foolin' us all
Never thought I'd work it out
How could I have known it was ever about you boy?
Now there's nothin' to say, cos there's no words
And we're not talkin' anyhow
You must have known I was never to doubt you boy

If it was so fine, it was so good
Oh you're unbelievable
All this time I've been living without you boy
But not your lyin'
It felt so good, the world don't know
Now they'll never find out
How all these years she mustered beside you boy
Don't forget that I

Was the one that you found
And if I know you
You'll find me someplace new
I hope I never, I hope I never have to
We're a waste of time
And if I know you, learned long ago it's true
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

Go and explain, explain it again, boy that this all started
Found you lying in the arms of another girl
So stop your crying
Day after day, year after year
Far too long it lasted
You must have thought I was nothing without you boy
Don't forget that I

Was the one that you found
And if I know you
You'll find me someplace new
I hope I never, I hope I never have to
We're a waste of time
And if I know you, learned long ago it's true
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

And tonight, if we learn that the world's on fire
I guess I'll turn to you
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

I fail to find
So hard to find
And I can't find a way for you and I to go further

I'm always learning things the hard, hard, hardest way.

Cos I was the one, that you found
And if I know you, you'll find me someplace new
I hope you never, I hope you never get to

Tonight, if we learn that the world's on fire
I guess I'll turn to you
I hope I never, I hope I never have to
