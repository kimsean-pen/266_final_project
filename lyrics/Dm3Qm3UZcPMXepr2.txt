In the cool of the evening
when everything is getting kinda groovy
I call you up and ask you
If you'd like to go with me and see a movie
First you say no, you've got some plans for the night
Then you stop and say "alright"
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you

You always keep me guessing
I never seem to know what you are thinking
And if a girl looks at you
It's for sure your little eye will be a-winking
I get confused 'cause I don't know where I stand
And then you smile and hold my hand
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you

Spooky

Maybe someday you'll decide to stop these games
That you've been playing
I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's
Been dying to be saying
Just like a ghost you've been haunting my dreams
So I proposed on Halloween
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you

Spooky
