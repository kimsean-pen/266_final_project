(Stay)
Ah, just a little bit longer
(Please)
Please, please, please, please
Tell me you're going to

Now, how your daddy don't mind
And your mommy don't mind
If we have another dance
Yeah, just one more
One more time

Oh, won't you stay
Just a little bit longer
Please let me hear
You say that you will
Say you will

Won't you press your
Sweet lips to mine
Won't you say you love me
All of the time

(Stay)
Just a little bit longer
(Please)
Please, please, please, please
Tell me you're going to

Come on, come on, come on and, yeah
Come on, come on, come on and stay, yeah
Come on, come on, come on and stay, woops
Come on, come on, come on
