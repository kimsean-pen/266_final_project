Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
They talk about your new tube
Not like you to look good
Look at you with disgust
You just
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince

Don't listen to what people say
When what they say is crazy
Ain't got we trust
You just
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince

Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
You just
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
