Bitch I shop Whole Foods like I'm booooujie!
Pass the blunt, my mind is missing
Tweet my shit I need the mentions
Stop pretending
Look!

Riding round the city
Like a side bitch
Hermit till die
Close the blinds bitch
Momma told me baby you's a prophet
So profit
And treat these fucking labels like a side -- hold up
Fuck it dog had do it
Reviewers looking stupid
Stick to music
I'm am the Black God
Fuck a human
Stanley Kubrick
You know the rapping shit be therapeutic
Pitchfork told me to never be abusive
Unless I'm moving units
I see what the truth is
'Cause niggas preaching bout the pussy be the biggest douches
Wow

I'm out the window looking real stupid
Fuck that
It's young Sully
How I peep the ruins
Trust that
I whip the whip like the shit been boosted
My bus pass
Ain't been legit
Since I smashed karreuche (not true)
These people thinking that they warriors
They straight kabuki
I hit your momma with Conker's Bad Fur Day
Goldeneye hit em up
Perfect Dark nigga for the job so I zip em up
And put em in a bag
Like I'm picking up dog shit
