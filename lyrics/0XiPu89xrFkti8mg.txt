The best we can agree on
Is it could have been worse
What happened to your old
Benevolent universe?

You know the one with stars
That revolve around you
Beaming down full of promises
To bring good news

You used to feel that way
The saddest words you could ever say
But I know you? ll remember that day
And the most beautiful words I could ever say
And the most beautiful words I could ever say

The worst thing about it all
Is that you might have been right
And I'm still not really sure
What started that fight

And I still get this feeling
There? s more trouble ahead
So never mind the bad news
Let's have the good news instead

You used to feel that way
The saddest words you could ever say
But I know you'll remember that day
And the most beautiful words I could ever say
And the most beautiful words

Some would say they never fear a thing
Well, I do
And I'm afraid enough for both of us
For me and you

Time, if nothing else, will do its worst
So do me that favor and tell me the good news first
The good news first
You used to feel that way
The saddest words you could ever say
But I know you'll remember that day
And the most beautiful words I could ever say
And the most beautiful words I could ever say
To the most beautiful words I could ever say
