Reign upon me, show me how I will survive.
Try and tell me a way to feel alive.
Bring it back to life, to whole new heights and tell me what is needed
I know you'll guide me home down this darkened road
Rain upon me
Shower me with the tears of salvation
Hold me close, hold me near

I find myself another year spent facing a wall
My life; our path has never been shown, but we move on
Fighting to keep our reign from them
Fighting to keep our reign from them

We will fall into the blacker sense of reason
Choose your side
I hope to God you pick the right one this time

Reign upon me, show me how I will survive
Try and tell me a way to feel alive
Bring it back to life, to whole new heights and tell me what is needed
I know you'll guide me home down this darkened road

We are the Crown!
We are the Crown!
We are the Crown!
We are the Crown!
Stand up and scream it loud!
We are the Crown!
Triumphant, immovable

In darkness we find ourselves
We find ourselves

Reign upon me, show me how I will survive
Try and tell me a way to feel alive
Bring it back to life, to whole new heights and tell me what is needed
I know you'll guide me home down this darkened road

I knew we would pursue the right path, even if it was long
We haven't changed, we stay the same; ever strong

Show me the new day
Show me the new day
Know as long as our hearts are beating,
we will always find our way
