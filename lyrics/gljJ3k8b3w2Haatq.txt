Heaven's gone, the battle's won
I had to say goodbye
Lived and learned from every fable
And I wonder how to move on
From all I had inside
Place my cards upon the table
In blood I draw the line

I've given all my pride
Living a life of misery
Always there, just underneath
Haunting me, quietly alone
It's killing me, killing me
Dead and gone, what's done is done
You are all I have become
I'm letting go of what I once believed

So goodbye agony
I watch the stars and setting suns
As the years are passing by
I never knew that hope was fatal
Until I looked it in the eye
And now I'm not sure I am able
To reach the other side

I'm casting out the light
Living a life of misery
Always there, just underneath
Haunting me, quietly alone
It's killing me, killing me
Dead and gone, what's done is done
You are all I have become
I'm letting go of what I once believed

So goodbye agony

Goodbye agony
Not alone in forgiving
The faithful and the blind
Innocence is forsaken
I leave them all behind

And now I see that even angels never die
Living a life of misery
Always there, just underneath
Haunting me, quietly alone
It's killing me, killing me
Dead and gone, what's done is done
You are all I have become
I'm letting go of what I once believed
So goodbye agony
Goodbye agony
Goodbye agony
