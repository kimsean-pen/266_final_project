Baby, I got love for thee so deep inside of me
I don't know where to start
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I love you more than anything
But the words can't even touch what's in my heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (no, no)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When I try to explain it
I be sounded insane
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue tied and twisted
I can't explain what I'm feeling
And I say, baby, baby, baby (baby I)

Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby (baby I)
Oh, baby, baby I (baby I)
All I'm trying to say is you're my everything, baby
But everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
Baby, baby

Baby, I'm so down for you
No matter what you do (real talk), I'll be around
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (hey, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (oh, baby)

See, baby I been feeling you
Before I even knew what feelings were about
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (oh, baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When I try to explain it
I be sounded all crazy
Words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue-tied and twisted
I can't explain what I'm feeling
And I say, baby, baby, baby (baby I)

Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby (baby I)
Oh, baby, baby I (baby I)
All I'm trying to say is you're my everything, baby
But everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Straight up, you got me all in
How could I not be?
I sure hope you know
If it's even possible, I love you more
Than the word "love" can say it
It's better not explaining
That's why I keep saying, baby I

Oh, baby, my baby, my baby (baby I)
My baby, baby I (baby I)
All I'm trying to say is you're my everything, baby
But everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it
Baby, baby (baby), baby, baby (baby I)

Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby (baby I)
Oh, baby, baby I (baby I)
All I'm trying to say is you're my everything, baby
But everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it

But everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it

But everytime I try to say it
Words they only complicate it

Baby, baby, baby, baby
