I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes
Love is all around me
And so the feeling grows

It's written on the wind
It's everywhere I go, oh yes, it is
So if you really love me
Come on and let it show, oh

You know, I love you, I always will
My mind's made up
By the way that I feel
There's no beginning
There'll be no end
'Cause on my love you can depend

I see your face before me
As I lay on my bed
I kinda get to thinking
Of all the things you said, oh yes I did

You gave your promise to me
And I gave mine to you
I need someone beside me
In everything and I do, oh yes I do

You know, I love you, I always will
My mind's made up by the
Way that I feel
There's no beginning
There'll be no end

'Cause on my love you can depend, yeah
Got to keep it movin'
Ooh, it's written in the wind
Oh, everywhere I go, yeah, ooh well
So if you really love me, love me, love me
Come on and let it show

Come on and let it show
(Come on and let it)
(Come on and let it)
Come and let it show, baby

(Come on and let it)
Come on, come on, come on let it show, baby
(Come on and let it)
(Come on and let it)

Come on and let it show
Come on and let it show, baby
Come on and let it show
