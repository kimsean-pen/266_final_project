Let the record play
Let the record play
Let the record play

The way that you dance
The way that you move
The way that you stare at me
Across the room

You carry Dior bags
And you got your Chanel
You wear Louis Vuitton, HG and YSL

Now I got Bathing Ape, I got DCMA
I got brass knuckles hanging
From my neck in my chain

I got a model 26
But she stays in her place
I got a Kershaw neatly
Tucked inside in my waist

And the record keeps playing
The same old song
The hipsters been muggin' on me all night long

They say, aha, ahha
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl

They say, aha, ahha
But the record keeps playing
The same old song

They say, aha, ahha
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl

Now she sweating my friends
And my hurricane shoes
She likes the records I spin
My Adam Barton tattoos

But she can't say what's up
So what does she do
She just stays posted up
The other side of the room

I got AMC tattooed on my hand
I got black wall street on a black bandanna

And the record keeps playing
The same old song
The hipsters been muggin' on me all night long

They say, aha, ahha
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl

They say, aha, ahha
But the record keeps playing
The same old song

They say, aha, ahha
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl

She, she, she don't wanna talk about it
He, he, he wants to fight about
Me, me, I don't wanna fight about it
And I just wanna be about it
I'm just trying to stay out of it

Step out the wagon
You know the boy starts to hate
The girl that came with him
Less like that's not the boy she dates

They get to fighting and swearing
And now the boyfriend is staring
The disco ball on the ceiling
Looks like the chain that I'm wearing
But the music keeps playing

I got brass knuckles hanging
From my neck in my chain
I got brass knuckles hanging
From my neck in my chain

And the record keeps playing
The same old song
The hipsters been muggin' on me all night long
They say aha, ahha
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl
And the record keeps playing
The same old song
The hipsters mean muggin' on me all night long
They say aha, ahha
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl
You carry Dior bags
And you got your Chanel
You wear Louis Vuitton, HG, and YSL
Now I got Bathing Ape, I got DCMA
I got brass knuckles hanging
From my neck in my chain
I got brass knuckles hanging
From my neck in my chain
