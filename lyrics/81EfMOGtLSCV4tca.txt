When the slow parade went past
When it felt so good you knew it couldn't last
And all too soon the end was gonna come without a warning
And you'd have to just go home

And the way it all went by
When somebody said "Come on, it's getting late"
And you thought the world might end if you just looked the other way
Now you wish that you had stayed

And there's so much more that you could see if you just stick around
And all the street light secrets whispering for you to come back out
Oh no, there's so much more that you need to work out
Oh no, you don't want that parade to leave you now
Not now

And the days are all the same
In a town so big, and no one knows your name
And the people fade away, and all stars are just a flicker
And you're left there all alone, alone

When there's so much more that you could see if you just stick around
And all the street light secrets whispering for you to come back out
Oh no, there's so much more that you need to work out
Oh no, you don't want that parade to leave you now

When the music's over
But the song stays in your head
Yeah

Oh no, there's so much more that you need to work out
Oh no, you don't want that parade to leave you now

Yeah, well there's so much more that you need to work out
Yeah, and you don't want that parade to leave you now
