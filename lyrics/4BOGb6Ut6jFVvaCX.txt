We used to live life through a filtered lens
There we'd close our eyes and play pretend
We used to never sleep, we'd just fool around
Lost in our own time, that's how fools are found
That's how we were found

Now I have to get used to not doing the things that I used to
You have to get used to all the shit that you've done
Now I have to get used to not doing the things that I used to
You have to get used to all the shit that you've done

Remember when we'd laugh at our worried friends
We would roll our eyes, they don't understand
Ironic how the ones that you treat so poor
Have the shoulder in the open wood, in the open wood
Please don't close the door

Now I have to get used to not doing the things that I used to
You have to get used to all the shit that you've done
Now I have to get used to not doing the things that I used to
You have to get used to all the shit that you've done

What have we done?
What have we done?
What have we done?
What have we done?
What have we done?
What have we done?
What have we done?
What have we done?
What have we done?
What have we done?
What have we done?
What have we done?

Now you have to get used to not doing the things that you used to
I have to get used to all the shit I've done
