Gone cast away in time
Evil yours, now evil mine
So I robbed you blind
The voices in my head

Suggest a less than peaceful side
The endless possibilities
Controlling every fight

You can't break me!
Crushed the fears of yesterday
You can't change me!
Barriers our trust will fade

I've stood in the dark
Been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead
I'm trying to survive

I'm not ready to die

Damned, watch the masses fall
Burn it down, control 'em all
(Help me)Make me crawl
To daddy's little girl
To read the writings on the wall

While cast into the nothingness
The final curtain calls

You can't break me!
Crushed the fears of yesterday
You can't change me!
Barriers our trust will fade

I've stood in the dark
Been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead
I'm trying to survive

I'm not ready to die

Through the madness we find
Loyalty is no match for power
Say goodbye to your life
Left to rot in your darkest hour
Friends won't help you now as long as you're mine

You can't break me!
Crushed the fears of yesterday
You can't change me!
Barriers our trust will fade

I've stood in the dark
Been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead
I'm trying to survive
I'll control the world one person at a time
As I damn the dead
I'm trying to survive
I'm not ready to die
Oh!
I'm not ready to die
I'm not ready to die!
I'm not ready to die!
I'm not ready to die!
Ready to die!
(Ready to die!)
(Ready to die!)
