Oh, you know it makes me sad
To see you feel so bad
But it's happened to you many times before
But if you will come with me
Then girl, you will see
That you won't have to cry anymore

There's no reason to feel blue
Because of what he says to you
And I wouldn't want to see you hurt no more
I could never do you wrong
'Cause my love for you's too strong
And you won't have to cry anymore

Oh, I saw you there with tears in your eyes
Because he told you so many, many lies

Oh, you know it isn't right
To put yourself uptight
By thinking 'bout the things he's done before
Just trust the love in me
And girl, you will see
That you won't have to cry
No, you won't have to cry
No, you won't have to cry anymore
