Then you said a little more about
Your dreams like that was my call (My call)
"If you would only listen"
Bypassed everything and went
Straight for the neck (I study)
We're studied
(Up nightly)
Dragged you out into the streets
Before you buckled at your knees
(You buckled at your knees)

"What's it feel like to be a ghost?"
(Louder now, louder now)
"So what's it feel like to be a ghost?" Ahh
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for)
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for)

This is quick but not quite painless
It sits perched on your arm
Tacky and irrelevant (So what?)
A permanent reminder that, oh Christ
(I study)
We're studied
(Up nightly)
Dragged you out into the streets
Before you buckled at your knees (Buckled)

"What's it feel like to be a ghost?"
(Louder now, louder now)
"So what's it feel like to be a ghost?" Ahh
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for?
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for)

I said "So look closely
There might be something you like"
"What was it like?"
(Oh and I)
Look so close but it's been months
Who knows if I will get this right
(Oh and I)
Look so closely, there might
Be something you'd like
What was it like?

Oh and I

"So what's it feel like to be a ghost?"
(Louder now, louder now)
"What's it feel like to be a ghost?" Ahh
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for)
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Are you up for, are you up for)
