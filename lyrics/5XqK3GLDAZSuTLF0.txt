Unvited feelings they come
with out warning and stay too long
i don't wanna feel, and if run
they'll be twice as strong

i wait for a warning,
i'm waiting for some kinda sign
i try to seperate my body from my mind

chorus:
cold feelings in the night
you know this feeling just ain't right
and though i try i just can't hide
cold feelings in the night

i watch the second hand as it slowly
goes strolling by. i don't want to feel
when a loved ones time's come to die
i wait for a warning, i'm waiting for
some kinda sign
i try and seperate, try to seperate
my body from my mind
yeah i got faith but sometimes
fear it just weighs too much
i don't wanna feel, cold winds blowin'
through me w/ an icy touch
i wait for a warning, i'm waiting
for some kinda sign.
i try to seperate my body from my mind
