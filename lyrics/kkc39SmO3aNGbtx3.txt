I see you there,
like a light in the sky
Don't give up,
and I'll fight
If you show me a sign

The monkeys in exile,
they're screaming 'cause they know it's time
The city it sleeps,
Not knowing the reason why

We stop and stare,
'cause we don't know where we're going
I see the stars on the horizon
I told a lie

I see you there like a light in the sky,
Don't give up,
and I'll fight
If you show me a sign

The world fills with darkness
No power line, no reason to shine
We'll sail off this ocean
and search out the reason why

We stop and stare,
'cause we don't know where we're going
We brave the cold,
we try to hide our fear

We stop and stare,
'cause we don't know where we're going
I see the stars on the horizon
I told a lie

All I see is the flashing of lights,
I need to feel the heat,
Don't give up the fight
I see your pain is rough,
you're burning so bright

The castle sleeps,
the arches take aim
I feel the fire,
do you feel it the same?
All I see is the flashing of lights tonight

We stop and stare,
'cause we don't know where we're going
I see the stars on the horizon
I told a lie

We stop and stare,
'cause we don't know where we're going
We brave the cold,
we try to hide our fear

We stop and stare,
'cause we don't know where we're going
I see the stars on the horizon
I told a lie
