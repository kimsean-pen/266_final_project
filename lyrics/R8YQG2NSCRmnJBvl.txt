Can't seem to erase you
I threw out all the records you're on
Every week there's another friend
Who doesn't know how bad you got
In the heat of a moment
I threw them in the trash
I hope you felt a tingle or a psychic punch or scratch
Keep us in the news feed
Watch as things improve
I hope evil can see this
And you get what you deserve
Never relayed the message
How bad the drinking water got
I wish for you to suffer
Like I had wished that we would not
I left once, but I'll stay now
If we promise that I can
I begged her to apologize
For what was said inside the van

We can see you in the garden
With the snake under your hair
You don't hold upon the water
There's nothing under there

I hope evil can see this
And you get what you deserve
I hope evil can see this
And you get what you deserve

If the things you steal could save you
I would think you're doing well
But they never helped a little bit before
As far as I could tell
Don't forget the footnote
Some unpaid intern ghostwrote in your unfinished memoir
About the time you held the world inside your hands
And left it at the bar
