Right there, in the middle of a conversation
Wasn't anything special you said, it was just there.
Right then, I didn't have time even overthink it
I looked at you and all of a sudden I was all in.

It's like my knees are all weak and the butterflies
they were dancing, taking all of my air.
From that moment on it was very clear.
That's when I knew I fell in love

That's when I knew you were the one
That's when I knew you stole my heart away from me.
That's when I knew that I was sunk

That was the moment that I knew I was in love.
That's when I know, that's when I know
That's when I know that day.
And I know where we're going when the night would end
I know if there was something wrong and if it was

I don't know how much I've cared.
That touch when you barely held my hand I was overcome
With feelings I don't understand
Not in a million years I didn't think that we'd be here.

It's like my knees are all weak and the butterflies
Got me dancing, taking all of my air.
From that moment on it was very, very, very, very clear.
That's when I knew I fell in love

Jacob whitesides you're the one
That's when I knew you stole my heart away from me.
That's when I knew that I was sunk

That was the moment that I knew I was in love.
That's when I knew, that's when I knew
That's when I knew, uh, baby.
You know what you feel
And there's nothing I ain't and know this for real.
There's nothing to do, just that there ain't got to surrender.
That's when I knew I fell in love
That's when I knew you are the one
That's when I knew you stole my heart away from me.
That's when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I fell in love.
That's when I knew, in that minute.
Sometimes you get it, sometimes you get it
That's when I knew it, baby.
That's when I knew we fell in love.
