Hop a fast train out of town
Downside up and upside down
Going fast is going slow
What could've been, we'll never know
In this place that has no name
I can't remember why I came
Then I hear you whisper low
One more mile to Jericho
Nothing is ever what it seems
When you live inside you dreams

The walls will tumble
The walls will tumble
But I'm not gonna cry
My heart won't crumble
My heart won't crumble
If we ever say goodbye

Everybody gets the joke
Where's the fire?
Where's the smoke?
Money, love and jealousy
Something's got a hold of me
But I'll follow where you go

One more mile to Jericho

The walls will tumble

The walls will tumble
But I'm not gonna cry
My heart won't crumble
My heart won't crumble

If we ever say goodbye
Goodbye now
Goodbye

One more mile
One more kiss
One more word
One more wish
And love will save us this I know
From this place called Jericho
The walls will tumble
The walls will tumble
But I'm not gonna cry
My heart won't crumble
My heart won't crumble
If we ever say goodbye
The walls will tumble
The walls will tumble
But I'm not gonna cry
My heart won't crumble
My heart won't crumble
If we ever say goodbye
The walls will tumble
The walls will tumble
If we ever say goodbye
My heart won't crumble
My heart won't crumble
If we ever say goodbye
The walls will tumble
The walls will tumble
If we never say goodbye
My heart won't crumble
My heart won't crumble
If we ever say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
