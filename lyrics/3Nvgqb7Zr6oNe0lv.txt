I put a spell on you
'cause you're mine
you better stop the things you do
I tell you I ain't lyin'
I ain't lyin'
You know I can't stand it
You runnin' around
You know better daddy
I can't stand cause you put me down
I put a spell on you
because you're mine
you're mine
you know I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you anyhow
and I don't care
if you don't want me
I'm yours right now
I put a spell on you
because you're mine
you know I can't stand it
you runnin' around
You know better daddy
I can't stand cause you put me down
I put a spell on you
because you are mine
