I'm blue and lonesome,
as a man can be
I'm blue and lonesome ooh,
as a man can be
I don't have headaches over myself,
my love has gone away from me

Baby, please,
come on back home to me
Baby, please yeah,
come on back home to me
Yes, my heart is full of misery,
baby, you won't be sweet to me

I'm gonna cast myself off,
down in the deep blue see
I'm gonna cast myself off, yeah,
down in the deep blue see
Where the whales and the fishes,
have a fuss over me
