I saw Jacob, he lay in the street
He said the air out here is like amphetamine
And I never ever wanna sleep again
I wanna live till I die

They took all his money and all that he had
But he smiled with his eyes and his face was bright red
And spit would run from his mouth when he said
"I wanna live till I die."

'Cause I am alive and there's blood in my arms
This is a day that is brighter than bombs
This is a day that is brighter than bombs
I will live till I die
Till I die

There's more inside of me than skin and bones
There's more inside of me than skin and bones
I am born again today and all my sins are washed away
There's more inside of me than skin and bones

Jacob sat on the roof and he said
Someday the earth will cast out its dead
If you dwell in the dust then wake up and sing
I will live till I die

Jacob smiled when he said to me
I am not waiting on the Red Sea
To open up and rain pearls on me
I will live till I die
Till I die

There's more inside of me than skin and bones
There's more inside of me than skin and bones
I am born again today and all my sins are washed away
There's more inside of me than skin and bones

As long as I live and there's blood in my arms
This is a day that is brighter than bombs
This is a day that is brighter than bombs
This is a day that is brighter than bombs

There's more inside of me than skin and bones
There's more inside of me than skin and bones
I am born again today and all my sins are washed away
There's more inside of me than skin and bones
