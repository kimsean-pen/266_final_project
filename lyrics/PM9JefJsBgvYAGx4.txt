I've been lonely, I've been waitin' for you
I'm pretending and that's all I can do
The love I'm sendin'
Ain't makin' it through to your heart

You've been hidin', never lettin' it show
Always tryin' to keep it under control
You got it down and you're well on your way to the top
But there's somethin' that you forgot

What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
And what about love?
Don't let it slip away

What about love?
I only want to share it with you
You might need it someday

I can't tell you what you're feelin' inside
And I can't sell you what you don't want to buy
Something's missing, you got to look back on your life
You know something here just ain't right

What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
What about love?
Don't let it slip away
What about love?
I only want to share it with you

What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
What about love?
Don't let it slip away

But what about love?
I only want to share it with you
Oh no
Ohh ohh, oh what about love?

Yeah
Ooh ooh hoo
What about love?
Love, love, love
What about, what about love?
Ooh hoo hoo hoo
