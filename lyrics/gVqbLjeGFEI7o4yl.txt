Why call it love
When it's a war?
Give you my all
Cling to my falling
Sometimes all I got is blue notes and green trees
It's so dark and lonely
Never had no real love

I touched the sun
I drowned in rain
Question the answers
Found truth in my pain
And sometimes all I got is blue notes and green trees
It's so dark and lonely
Never had no real love

I've been a star
And kissed the moon
Swim with the mad birds
Holes in my shoes
Sometimes all I got is blue notes and green trees
It's so dark and lonely
Never had no real love

Blue notes, blue notes, blue notes
And green trees
