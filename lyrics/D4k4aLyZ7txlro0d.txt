I need to find my way
Back to you now
This renegade pace is killing me off
I saw the master last night
Oh, what a blast
I feel so useless now
Yet hallowed by his touch
Am I that needy, that greedy?
Always asking for too much?
I saw the master last night

Now Amsterdam bleeds
With weeds and bad seeds
Worse coffee and nameless deeds
And an endless string of bad f***
Now Amsterdam bleeds
With weeds and bad seeds
Worse coffee and nameless deeds
And an endless string of bad f***

In swarms we rise
In swarms we fly
In swarms we fight
In swarms we die
