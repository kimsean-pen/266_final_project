I have seen whats left for all the rest of you
And its not what you think it will be
For the gift and the curse of whats been shown to you
I cant believe what I feel it is taking
Never give, never bend - its all a lie to you
And all you do is seem to remind me
Of all the times and the ways I would have died for you
And this is all the thanks that you'll show me...

If you would show
The light for me
The things i'd known
That now id see

This is - not the same not now, never, no not again
When the dreams and the truth came colliding
And the same can be said for all the rest of them
See the strong and the weak divided
Yet I feel alive
For all the pain I have
And all you do is seem to remind me
Of all of the times and the ways I would have died for you
And this is all of the thanks that you'll show me

If you would show
The light for me
The things i'd known
That now id see

If you would show
The light for me
The things i'd known
That now id see

Energy as I feel it calling
Cannot see through the cloud thats forming
Blinding as it passes before my eyes
Looking for the thign thats calling
Now I see that its coming after
Now I see that its coming after... me

If you would show
The light for me
The things i'd known
That now id see
