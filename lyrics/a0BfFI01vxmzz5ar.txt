Hi-Fi fellas and Lo-fi chicks
Hair is how we take you there
Bones is how we make it now
Now I'm after a walking disaster

We live life we live it large
In control taking charge
You are soft and we are hard
You don't desire to step to our fire

we live life we live it large
In control taking charge
You are soft and we are hard
You don't desire to step our fire

You're gonna know if you keep on asking questions!
You're gonna know real soon!
You say, "Hey, I never fall,"
As you're falling down
Your blood is all around you now
But you see nothing at all
You say "hey" you get against the wall!
yeah YOU get against the wall!

You're gonna know if you keep on asking questions
You're gonna know real soon
You say, "Hey, I never fall,"

It's just the way the city smells
It's just the way the rain falls now
We be the Ritalin calm you down
We be the Ritalin calm you down

It's just the way you talk so loud.
It's just the way the bones fall down.
We be the Ritalin calm you down
We be the Ritalin calm you down, ok?!
