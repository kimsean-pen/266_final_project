Here it comes again
Cannot outrun my desire
Cover my descent
And throw the beauty on the fire

Drawn towards the edge
Do I assume I could fly?
Every secret shared
Why do I drink the feelings dry?
Don't go too far
Limitation scars

Tonight, could I be lost forever
To drown my soul in Sensory Pleasure?

Here it comes again
You raise the bar even higher
I cannot catch my breath
So throw the beauty on the fire
Don't push too hard
Limitation scars

Tonight, could I be lost forever
To drown my soul in Sensory Pleasure?

Sensory Pleasure
Sensory Pleasure
Sensory Pleasure
Could I be lost forever?

Do I assume I could fly?

Tonight, could I be lost forever
To drown my soul in Sensory Pleasure?

Sensory Pleasure
Sensory Pleasure
Sensory Pleasure
Could I be lost forever?
