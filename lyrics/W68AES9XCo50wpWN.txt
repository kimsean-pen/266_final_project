Wake up like a quarter to twelve
Hoping that today I'll be someone else
So dumb how I talk to myself
This is hell on earth but I can turn it into heaven

What makes me mad
All of the lost time
Only left here to realize
What makes me mad
Can't open up my eyes

Just when I think it's over
Just when I think I've lost my mind
I'm in field of clovers
I'm running forward back to life

Went a little crazy yesterday
Everbody saw, but it's okay
Swimming in a river of my feels
Looking in the mirror, like what's the deal
Now, now, no matter what the doctor's offered me
Gonna shake that dark cloud off of me
Finally know how fast I gotta run
Now I'mma move for my kingdom come
Always on the move for a rainy day
Needed to change

Just when I think it's over
Just when I think I've lost my mind
I'm in field of clovers
I'm running forward back to life

Sitting, pretty, steady, picking clovers
Finally I feel I'm getting closure
Sitting, pretty, steady, picking clovers
Finally I feel I'm getting closure

Just when I think it's over
Just when I think I've lost my mind
I'm in field of clovers
I'm running forward back to life

Sitting, pretty, steady, picking clovers
Finally I feel I'm getting closure
Sitting, pretty, steady, picking clovers
Finally I feel I'm getting closure
