I wanna breath in what's in your lungs
I need a revolution
I need a revolution
Oh, we can bicycle high a summer night
I need a revolution
I need a revolution

Should be leaving tonight
While we're still in our right minds
And we're gonna need that rifle on the wall
Should be leaving tonight
While we're still in our right minds
And we're gonna need that rifle on the wall

Oh, we could rave and be lovers once more
I need a revolution
I need a revolution
Oh, we could die from the dusks on summer nights
I need a revolution
I need a revolution

Should be leaving tonight
While we're still in our right minds
And we're gonna need that rifle on the wall

I'm gonna take off for a while
Sink back into the night
I'm gonna take off for a while
Sink back into the night

Should be leaving tonight
While we're still in our right minds
And we're gonna need that rifle on the wall
Should be leaving tonight

I'm gonna take off for a while
Sink back into the night

I'm gonna take off for a while
Sink back into the night

And we're gonna need that rifle on the wall
