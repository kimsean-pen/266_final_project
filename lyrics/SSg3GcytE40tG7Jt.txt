Someone wake me up from this crooked dream
As I know it now life ain't what it seems
Lost in this stream (life or dream) of consciousness
Release me

Denial is venomous, poisons them
Mindless mob played like fools deceives thee
Can't distinguish from reality
How the blatant has slipped through effortlessly
With a mindless clown at the helm of it all
This will be our downfall
Lucid I'm dreaming
This nightmare has no ending
And while the world turns their back on us
Still nothing changes, nothing changes

Am I dreaming?
Is it truly how it seems?
On deaf ears fall our screams, fall our screams
A boastful swine
Narcissistic ego inflation is your only mission
Rapid regression at the hands of bigots
A lucid nightmare, the life that I'm living
Am I dreaming?
Is this really how it seems?
On deaf ears fall our screams, fall our screams

When a cause comes along and you know in your bones that it is just
Yet refuse to defend it
At that moment you begin to die
And I have never seen so many corpses walking
around talking about justice. - Mumia Abu-Jamal
