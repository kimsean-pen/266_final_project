Behind these eyes a desert spirit
Sea serpent heart inside a sunken ship
I finally got it
All parts wrong
I didn't know how long it would take to do it
Behind these eyes
Dead grey mule
Torn apart moon in an empty room
It's easier now
And I just say I got better
It's easier now
That I just say I got better
It's easier when I just admit
Death comes now
And the next minute
the next minute
the next minute
Behind these eyes
Behind these eyes
Behind these eyes
Behind these eyes
Behind these eyes
