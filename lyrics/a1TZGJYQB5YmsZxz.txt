There's nothing here but the distance
There's nothing here but the mess
If you'd have shut up you've had it
You could have put it to rest
I am swelling in anger
I am the raging steel
I've had it up to here now
I'm so tired of your needs

And how does it feel to be on the fault line?
And how do we heal in the middle of decline?
'Cause it's a hell of a long way to fall just to learn to get up
And I'm not gonna forgive you for all of the things that you've done

There's nothing here but indifference
There's nothing here but the stress
These walls, they stink of your motives
Something you want to confess
You act the part of attachment
Of all the things you don't need
There's nothing left in this place but a reason to leave

And how does it feel to be on the fault line?
And how do we heal in the middle of decline?
'Cause it's a hell of a long way to fall just to learn to get up
And I'm not gonna forgive you for all of the things that you've done

How does it feel to be on the fault line?
And how do we heal in the middle of decline?
'Cause it's a hell of a long way to fall just to learn to get up
And I just can't forgive you, I just can't forgive you

I know we could be there, I know you and me had it through
So fuck it, girl, this is all for a means to get through
'Cause it's a hell of a long way to fall just to learn to get up
Because this world, this world, this world is never enough
