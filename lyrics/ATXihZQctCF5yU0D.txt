A place which I have searched a thousand times
To finally free myself
Forever wasn't ever long enough
I will refrain
I feel a passion washing over me
To shed the skin I'm in
This evolution will empower me
Now truth begins

And you will not find me
I am safe in here
I'm where I want to be

It's a place where a wish will be granted
Come, you'll see I'm right
It's a force that will live on within you
Dark as day is light
It's a place where your dreams will be slanted
And will always be
It's a force that was sent out to win you
Just you wait and see

Take one step closer to the borderline
Where night and day unite
This mortal coil I've gone and left behind
On holy soil

And you will not find me
I am safe in here
I'm where I want to be

It's a place where a wish will be granted
Come, you'll see I'm right
It's a force that will live on within you
Dark as day is light
It's a place where your dreams will be slanted
And will always be
It's a force that was sent out to win you
Just you wait and see

You will not find me
I am safe in here
I am where I want to be
So leave me now in peace

And you will not find me
I am safe in here
I'm where I want to be!

It's a place where a wish will be granted
Come, you'll see I'm right
It's a force that will live on within you
Dark as day is light
It's a place where your dreams will be slanted
And will always be
It's a force that was sent out to win you
Just you wait and see

It's a place where a wish will be granted
Come, you'll see I'm right
It's a force that will live on within you
Dark as day is light
It's a place where your dreams will be slanted
And will always be
It's a force was sent out to win you
Just you wait and see
