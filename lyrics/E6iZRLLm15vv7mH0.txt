It seeks to be released
The fragments of a once brightened disposition
Are blackened in misanthropic disgust
Of all that has unsettled from within

In mere repulsion, so ravenous the innermost
My form contorts in disbelief, my patience attenuated
In the arousal of so foul a stench, my very structure distorts
From beneath ever grinning lips doth vile corruption run

As black as the midnight air
Does it pour from my mouth, now agape
In the amorous arms of iniquity
Held is my porcelain form of frailty debased

Defiling, the ground beneath me now corrodes
A force unto this earth bestowed
Seething in noxious lament
Pooling from my very base
Does this eclipsing tide seek only to envelope

This loathsome liquid of origins unknown
From wounds exposed has run from this
My temple, now unto the ground
From within the purview of this darkest deception
Does this, oh verminous salvation, befoul the world beneath

My arms now opened in cruel depiction of Christ
I watch in horror as the world diminishes
