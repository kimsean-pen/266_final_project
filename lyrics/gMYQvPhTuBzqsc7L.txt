Channeling forces we don't understand
Into energy currents eternal
Whisper the passage once spoken
To enter the void before it collapses
Silence the patterns that echo
Yet still the voices can be heard
In this place beyond time
Astral projection
The dimensional loop
Natural law of infinite power

The many will become the few
Eternal torment perceived as paradise
Reflection of time
This is where you die

You have no future
Channeling dimensional energy
Forbidden transgression
Consequence the violation

You have no future
Channeling dimensional energy
Forbidden transgression
Consequence - the violation
You have no future
Channeling dimensional energy
Forbidden transgression
Consequence - the violation

You have no future
Channeling dimensional energy
Forbidden transgression
Consequence - the violation

Channeling forces we don't understand
Into energy currents eternal
Whisper the passage once spoken
To enter the void before it collapses
Silence the patterns that echo
Yet still the voices can be heard
In this place beyond time
Astral projection
Natural law of infinite power
