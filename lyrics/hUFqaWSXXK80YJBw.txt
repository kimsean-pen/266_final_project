everytime your down youve gotta move on
dream on when the love is gone

dream on when the love is gone
youve always gotta move on

dream on when the love is gone
everytime your down youve gotta move on
dream on when the love is gone
youve always gotta move on

everytime your down youve gotta move on
dream on when the love is gone
