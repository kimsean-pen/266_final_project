My mind takes you to where you need to be
Cure for your heartbreak to take away the pain
I could describe each mistake for you
Tattoo it on my tainted heart

But I won't ever tell the world
That I don't belong
Please don't ever tell the world
That I don't belong
That I don't belong

Can you still feel me or did I slip away
A sick man a monster broken still today
I can't explain what happens to me
Caught in the game I always start
I could describe each mistake for you
Tattoo it on my tainted heart

But I won't ever tell the world
That I don't belong
Please don't ever tell the world
That I don't belong
I won't ever change my ways
And I can't be strong
That I don't belong

And it's my own shame
I can't break away

But I won't ever tell the world
That I don't belong
Please don't ever tell the world
That I don't belong
Well I won't ever change my ways
And I can't be strong
Please don't ever tell the world
That I don't belong
That I don't belong
That I don't belong
