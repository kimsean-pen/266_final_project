In Paris and in Rome
And in places far from home
From the mountains to the sea
To wherever the road may lead
I wonder where you'll go
Will the sun shine as you go?
There's all the World, you know
Just beyond the things we know
Don't be lonely now
If you can try to be brave
Maybe the sun will come back
To wash your tears away

In Paris and in Rome
And wherevery you may roam
From the mountains to the sea
To wherever the road my lead
I wonder where you'll go
Will the sun shine as you go?
There's all the World you know
Just beyond the worlds we know

And I'll always remember
The things that we said
And the things that we dreamed
And the world we nearly had
