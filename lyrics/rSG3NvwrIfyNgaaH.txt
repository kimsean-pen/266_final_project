Some boys are filling,
some boys are filling the hole
They're making the killing
at the top of the billings
Their role,
and that's all that they know
But some boys don't listen,
ome boys don't listen at all
They don't ask for permission,
they lack inhibitions
No walls,
and they get what they want

But some boys don't know how to love

Some boys are singing,
some boys are singing the blues
Joylessly flinging with the girls
that they're bringing to their rooms
And then leave when they're through
Some boys are sleeping,
some boys are sleeping alone
Cause there's no one that's keeping
them warm through evening
They know
that they're on their own

Some boys don't know how to love

Some boys are filling,
some boys are filling the hole
Some boys are sleeping,
some boys are sleeping alone

Some boys don't know how to love
Some boys don't know how to love
Some boys don't know how to love
Some boys don't know how to love
