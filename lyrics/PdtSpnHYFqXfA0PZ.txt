I'm waiting for you right outside
The place we first locked eyes
(Oh)
I feel like we're both losing sight
We don't get to do this twice
And I wonder

Will you care
When I'm gone?
And it's time
And I've really had enough
And I'm sorry
For the trouble

That's been costing us so much
Splitting apart, it's getting harder to tell what you want
So bored with these games (games), games (games)

The last time that I left these steps
Was after our first kiss
I wonder why you haven't shown
I'll be leaving here alone
And I wonder

Will you care
When I'm gone?
And it's time
And I've really had enough
And I'm sorry
For the trouble

That's been costing us so much
Splitting apart, it's getting harder to tell what you want
So bored with these games (games), games (games)

(So bored with these games)
(So bored with these games, yeah)
(So bored with these games)
So bored with these
I'm left in the dark I never thought you'd be breaking my heart
I'm so bored with these games (games), games (games)

Will you care
When I'm gone?
And it's time
And I've really had enough
And I'm sorry
For the trouble
That's been costing us so much
Splitting apart, it's getting harder to tell what you want
So bored with these games (games), games (games)

Games (oh games), (oh yeah) games.
