I have heard the war and worry of the gospel
Ferry fast across the void
I have married broken spoke chargin' smoke wheels
Spit and swallowed opioids

I am the driver at the wheel of the horror
Marching circles at the gate
Mine eyes have seen the fury
So flattered by fate

Tonight, I'd rather count the warm fuse internally
Subtract the silence of myself
I would rather choose the middle mind of mystery
Reverse the riddle for my health

I'll unwind strange rhymes overpowering
Toss the chimneys in the sea
I believe I've seen the finger
Devine extremities

Please come closer to the feather smooth lens fire
Sadness is my luxury
Will you weather, join the cold, come before I die
More aware of it than me

The valves are blowing stone,
the kids are unabashed
Loneliness postponed
Mine eyes deceiving glory
I was born to die alone
