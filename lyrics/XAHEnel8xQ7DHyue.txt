Holding my breath
Last one I've got left
Till I see you
Deliver my heart with the
Pieces and parts of me left
Every last day seemed to carry the weight
Of a life time
Watch from the ground
As the gold fluttered down from the sky
Sweet sun
Send me the moon
Empty the skies out
Bringing me one step closer to you
Send it soon
And I will breathe in, breathe out
Until you come in and out
Of view
Of view
Inches away from you
Scared what I'll take from you, darling
I can live with your ghost
If you say that's the most I'll get
Darkness to light
Moved from day into night to be near you
Still here I stand
I am sinking like sand in your sea
Sweet sun

Send me the moon
Empty the skies out
Bringing me one step closer to you
Send it soon
And I will breathe in, breathe out
Until you come in and out
Of view
Of view
You already do
Never you mind where the evening should find us
Together
Distance can't take what is hidden here
Safe in my chest
I'll wait for the day when
We finally say now or never
Till then I'll be here wanting more
As I settle for at most fear
Sweet sun
Send me the moon
Empty the skies out
Bringing me one step closer to you
Send it soon
And I will breathe in, breathe out
Until you come in and out
I will breathe in, breathe out
Till you come in
I will breathe in, breathe out
Till you come in and out
Of view
Of view
