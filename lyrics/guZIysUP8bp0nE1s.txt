All is burned
The devil made me
Every hour
Down to the wire
Tell me that you'll be
Deafening silent under me

Freezing over
I will answer you in kind
Freezing over
I will answer you in kind

Strange hours through my fingers
Time standing still
Pretty hell
All is ravaged
I stay awake
Tell me it's easy
Godless one sighing inside me

Freezing over
I will answer you in kind
Freezing over
I will answer you in kind

Strange hours through my fingers
Time standing still
Pretty hell
