Cherry, tellms me somethings I don t wanna know
And I can t see
A light at the end for us anymore
But I can t keep crying
All of the time
No I can t keep crying
All of the time
Cherry, can be very sweet when she needs a friend

And I can t keep running
All of the time
No I can t keep running
All of the time
Cherry, I hate that it s true but you make me blue
I kept waiting, for you to find what I see in you
And I can t keep quiet,
All of the time
No I can t keep quiet
All of the time.
