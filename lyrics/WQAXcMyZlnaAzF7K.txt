The sweetest perfection to call my own
The slightest correction couldn't finely hone
The sweetest infection of body and mind
Sweetest injection of any kind

I stop and I stare too much
Afraid that I care too much
And I hardly dare to touch
For fear that the spell may be broken

When I need a drug in me
And it brings out the thug in me
Feel something tugging me
Then I want the real thing, not tokens

The sweetest perfection to call my own
The slightest correction couldn't finely hone
The sweetest infection of body and mind
Sweetest injection of any kind

Things you'd expect to be
Having effect on me
Pass undetectedly
But everyone knows what has got me

Takes me completely
Touches me sweetly
Reaches so deeply
I know that nothing can stop me

Sweetest perfection
An offer was made
An assorted collection
But I wouldn't trade

The sweetest perfection to call my own
The slightest correction couldn't finely hone
The sweetest infection of body and mind
Sweetest injection of any kind

The sweetest perfection to call my own
The slightest correction couldn't finely hone (nothing can stop me)
The sweetest infection of body and mind (takes me completely, touches so sweetly)
The sweetest injection of any kind (reaches so deeply, nothing can stop me)

The sweetest perfection to call my own (takes me completely, touches so sweetly)
The slightest correction couldn't finely hone (reaches so deeply, nothing can stop me)
The sweetest infection of body and mind (takes me completely, touches so sweetly)
The sweetest injection of any kind (reaches so deeply)
