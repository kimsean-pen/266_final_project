I can't believe what I saw yesterday
too many people try to walk away
well I believe that you may disagree
that there's a reason right in front of me

when are you gonna start
makin' up your heart
it is never too late for love to come back
I don't know where to go
I don't know who to show
there's nothing left but to wait for love

I will wait for love
in the morning dew
I will wait for love
when you ask me to
when the morning comes
I will wait for you
and in the afternoon
I will call on you
