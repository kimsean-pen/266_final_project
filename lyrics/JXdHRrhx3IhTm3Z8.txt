I'm sure you can make it,
Flip side while nothing changes.

I run past your street: deserted,
Fading like I'm your fading friend.

Incision,
Carved out.
No traces,
Of doubt.
I can't extract the truth;
You know it.
But what you give you get,
While this place spins
Like a heavy doorway.
But you've seen it all.

Pretence,
Rip this town.
You turn my world,
Upside down.

Incision,
Carved out.
No traces,
Of doubt.
I can't extract the truth;
You know it.
But what you give you get,
While this place spins
Like a heavy doorway.
Gather it around.

You built it up
So tear it down.
