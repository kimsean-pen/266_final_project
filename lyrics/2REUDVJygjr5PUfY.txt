We walk in to the hands of doom
We're coming out interior two
Why don't you come on over
Things here will never be the same
We feed the light with shadows of pain
Why don't you come back again
I hear our song in the wind
I see clouds laughing again
We fall into forever's lap
We speak when all the lines are tapped
And endlessly come on back
Whereever did we find this night
I'll come back in another life
Why don't you come back over again
Won't you come back over
