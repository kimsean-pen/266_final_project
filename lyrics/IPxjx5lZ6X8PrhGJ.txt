As we build a brand new planet
Lets reconstruct and get it straight

Unlock forgotten skills
Travel to a new dimension
Souls from the dark seduction
(Take heed), we are the new invention

We're the settlers of year zero
Lets reconstruct and take it back

*chorus*
Leaders of our time
Heading for a downfall
The threshhold of revolution
(Take heed)The last freedom call
Blanked out fire etched on the chrystal display
The seas are deep
You better swim
Don't go numb
Collect the word, add some gold and give it back
The seas are deep
You better swim
Don't go numb

From a thousand branches
Spreading the new voice

(guitar solo)

As we're heading for the throne
Connect, evolution will begin

*chorus*
