I am the lightning, i am the heat
I am the rain, rain oh, rain oh, rain (reign) all day
I am the rain
I'm gonna reign this way again
I am the rain

I am the spy
Before the blade
I am the raindrop out at sea I cause
The ripples that become the crashing waves
I am the rain, rain oh, rain oh, rain (reign) all day
I am the rain

You thought a different day had come
A day you thought the earth was done
And if you could have said it all
I know you would have said it all
You thought a different day had come
A day you thought the earth was done
And if you could have said it all
I know you would have said it all

I am the rain
I'm gonna reign this way again (this reign way again)
I am the rain, rain oh, rain oh, rain (reign) all day

You thought a different day had come
A day you thought the earth was done
I am the rain
And if you could have said it all
I know you would have said it all
I am the rain
