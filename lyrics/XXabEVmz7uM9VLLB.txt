Every time I go home
There's another cell phone tower
Construction getting louder
Paving over yesterdays
You and I
We will try to find the side of it that's pretty
While our town becomes a city
We won't let it be erased

Empires rise, empires fall
Will you be my constant through it all?

I will hold your hand
And watch the world spin madly 'round this life we're in
Oh yeah, everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Oh yeah, everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with

Every once in a while
You know I get these real bad headaches
Worried about the mistakes
That I've made along the way
You and I
We can't hide
From the fact that we need each other
How else will I recover
When the fever comes again?

Temperatures rise, temperatures fall
Will you be my constant through it all?

I will hold your hand
And watch the world spin madly 'round this life, we're in
Oh yeah, everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Oh yeah, everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with

There are no words, no words
When I'm with you, you, you

Every time I hear music
They've added more stuff to it
Things are always moving
To a futuristic place
Well, you and I
We will try
We can try and dance into tomorrow
But time will have to borrow
Not a minute left to waste

Heartbeats rise, heartbeats fall
Will you be my constant through it all?

I will hold your hand
And watch the world spin madly 'round this life we're in
Oh yeah, everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Oh yeah, everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
