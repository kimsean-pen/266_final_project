Born burnt inside a black mass
A fraction less than others
A select sickness keep me hid
Ravaged by others
What craft, obsession brought me down
What men see pleasing
But who, who can I please?

You'll stare at me in a fantasy
Love me through the lens
Our memories falling on my knees
Touch me through the fence

No future, fear this ugly wave
It's more trash than water
I'm done sticking for more blood
And I just get water
Should I lay with my head bowed down?
Exist in exits
But where, where can I exist?

You'll stare at me in a fantasy
Love me through the lens
Our memories falling on my knees
Touch me through the fence

Where can I let the ghost in?
Where can I let the ghost in?
Where can I let the ghost in?
Where can I let the ghost in?
When rest comes easy fall asleep
Let bad men fail us all

You'll stare at me in a fantasy
Love me through the lens
Our memories falling on my knees
Touch me through the fence
You'll stare at me in a fantasy
Love me through the lens
Our memories falling on my knees
Touch me through the fence
