Dear, love is a burning fire
Stay, 'cause then the flames grows higher
Babe, don't let him steal your heart
It's easy, easy

Girl, this game can't last forever
Why? We cannot live together
Try? Don't let him take your love from me

You're no good, can't you see?
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love, set you free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So leave it Louie
'Cause I'm a lover

Stay, 'cause this boy wants to gamble
Stay, love's more than he can handle, girl
Oh, come and stay by me forever, ever

Why does he go on pretending?
That his love is never-ending fate
Babe, don't let him steal your love from me

You're no good, can't you see?
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love, set you free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me

Oh, let it, Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So leave it Louie
'Cause I'm a lover

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it, Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So leave it Louie
'Cause I'm a lover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it, Louie
