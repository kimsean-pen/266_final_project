I guess it's okay for now
Put my pride to the side
Don't wanna let you down
Take my heart and crush it, leave it
Splattered on the ground
Your love is like a bomb
From a distance hear the sound

I guess it's okay for now
Put my pride to the side
Don't wanna let you down
Take my heart and crush it, leave it
Splattered on the ground
Your love is like a bomb
From a distance hear the sound

Tell me that you here for me when nobody's around
Ayy, but I guess it's okay for now
Put my pride to the side
Don't wanna let you down
Take my heart and crush it, leave it
Splattered on the ground
Your love is like a bomb
From a distance hear the sound

Ayy, where did we go wrong?
Seems like everything changed
Shawty used to be my main thing
Let her walk with me on the stage
Throw the water out, let it rage
Write my pain in every single page
If I knew you would've fucked me over
Then I never would've made my way
I can't stand when you lie to my face
Texting back, be like, "Give me my space"
All alone like I'm locked in a cage
Run it up 'cause I like to get paid
Moved on and you still throwing shade
Back in the day, leave it back in the day
On to the future, I learned from mistakes
Playin' for keeps, I'm not playing it safe

But it's okay for now
If you try to take me down
I might have to take you out
All the time that I invested,
I'll stick to this paper route
I'm up somewhere in the clouds,
Make it rain when it's a drought

I guess it's okay for now
Put my pride to the side
Don't wanna let you down
Take my heart and crush it, leave it
Splattered on the ground
Your love is like a bomb
From a distance hear the sound

Tell me that you here for me when nobody's around
Ayy, but I guess it's okay for now
Put my pride to the side
Don't wanna let you down
Take my heart and crush it, leave it
Splattered on the ground
Your love is like a bomb
From a distance hear the sound

Oh, whoa
I was always feeling down, down, down
I was always feeling down
Feel like there's nobody around, 'round, 'round
Feel like there's nobody around
So I smoke it by the pound, pound, pound
Yeah, I like the way that sounds
Yeah, I like the way that sounds
