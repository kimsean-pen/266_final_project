Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells

Sometimes you love it
Sometimes you don't
Sometimes you need it then you don't wanna let go
Sometimes we rush it
Sometimes we fall
It doesn't matter baby we can take it real slow

Coz the way that we touch is something that we can't deny
And the way that you move
Oh it makes me feel alive
Come on

Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells

You try to hide it
I know you do
When are you ready?
Need up come and get to

You moving closer
I feel you breathe
It's like the world just disappears when you around me oh

Coz the way that we touch is something that we can't deny
oh yeah
And the way that you move
oh you make me feel alive
so come on

Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells

I say you want, I say you need
I can tell by your face you love the way it turns me on
I say you want, I say you need
I will do all the things that I would never do, you're wrong

Cause the way that we love is something that we cant fight
oh no
I just cant get enough, oh you make me feel alive
So come on

Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells

I say you want
I say you need
(I can tell by the way you're looking at me, I turn you on)
I say you want
I say you need
(if you got what it takes we don't have to wait, let's get it on)
Get it on, ooh!

Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
