I wait
I waited for you
I wanted for you
Something new
For us to do

You say
You've found your calling
You're running away
And there's nothing left
For us to do

Ok
I'm looking for a reaction
Ohhh
But you're not good at them
Ok
I'm looking for a reaction
Ohhh
But you're not good at them

I know what you're doing
You're running away again
I know what you're doing
I'm already way ahead
Cause you're a deadbeat girl
A deadbeat girl at heart
And when you try to be OK
You just fall apart

I know
I know you're hurting
I'm not gonna say anything
Or anything
I know
I know it's bad
I'm not gonna stay around
For anything

Ok
I'm looking for a reaction
Ohhh
But you're not good at them
Ok
I'm looking for a reaction
Ohhh
But you're not good at them

I know what you're doing
You're running away again
I know what you're doing
I'm already way ahead
Cause you're a deadbeat girl
A deadbeat girl at heart
And when you try and be OK
You just fall apart

Cause you're a deadbeat girl
A deadbeat girl at heart
And when you try to be OK
You just fall apart
Cause you're a deadbeat girl
A deadbeat girl at heart
And when you try to be OK
You just fall apart

I know what you're doing
You're running away again
I know what you're doing
I'm already way ahead
Cause you're a deadbeat girl
A deadbeat girl at heart
And when you try to be OK
You just fall apart
