If only I could cry
Just for one minute
I'd be gone in the depth of time
Searching for a world in which I'd feel fine
I'd just leg go
Like you in your letters

You made me believe in the self
And now I'm looking for how you felt, you felt

I, wont let go
Wont let go, tonight, of your hand
Who am I? But what does it matter?
Who am I? But what does it matter?
I, wont let go
Wont let go, tonight, of your hand

Who am I? But what does it matter?

Who am I? But what does it matter?

If only I could find

You for one second
I'd hold on to what it is that you threw
Waiting for you to get better and to
Just show your power
Like you had last summer
What you have is something you better keep
What you are is more than you think, than you think
What you have is something you better keep
What you are is more than you think, than you think

I, wont let go
Wont let go, tonight, of your hand
Who am I? But what does it matter?
Who am I? But what does it matter?
I, wont let go
Wont let go, tonight, of your hand
Who am I? But what does it matter?
Who am I? But what does it matter?

If only I could cry
Just for one minute
I'd be gone in the depth of time
Searching for a world in which I'd feel fine
It's only you, its only you, only you can do what it is that you feel
It's only you, its only you, only you can do what it is that you feel

I, wont let go
Wont let go, tonight, of your hand
Who am I? but what does it matter?
Who am I? but what does it matter?
I, wont let go
Wont let go, tonight, of your hand
Who am I? but what does it matter?
Who am I? but what does it matter?
I, wont let go
Wont let go, tonight, of your hand
Who am I? but what does it matter?
Who am I? but what does it matter?
I, wont let go
Wont let go, tonight, of your hand
Who am I? but what does it matter?
Who am I? but what does it matter?
