'Cause it can happen in a heartbeat, happen in a heartbeat!
'Cause it can happen in a heartbeat, happen in a heartbeat!
Can happen in a heartbeat, happen in a heartbeat!
In the night
I wouldn't make it on my own
I wouldn't change it for the world
I wouldn't break it, and I know
I wouldn't make it, make it on my own
I wanna be made of glass
You wanna know, you shatter up my heart
I wanna be made of stone
I wanna drive my golden Cadilac
Happen in a heartbeat, happen in a heartbeat
But I'm on my own
'Cause it can happen in a heartbeat, happen in a heartbeat
And I'm not alone no more
Happen in a heartbeat, happen in a heartbeat
But I'm on my own
'Cause it can happen in a heartbeat, happen in a heartbeat
And I'm not alone no more
I wouldn't make it on my own
I couldn't fight them off alone
I couldn't take it, and I know
I wouldn't make it on my own
I wanna be made of glass
You wanna know, you shatter up my heart
I wanna be made of stone
I wanna drive my golden Cadilac
Happen in a heartbeat, happen in a heartbeat
But I'm on my own
'Cause it can happen in a heartbeat, happen in a heartbeat
And I'm not alone no more
Happen in a heartbeat, happen in a heartbeat
But I'm on my own
'Cause it can happen in a heartbeat, happen in a heartbeat
And I'm not alone no more
While you're alive
All the time
You set me up for life
Follow the line
Products of mine
You know you set me up for life
Longer the line
All the time
You set me up for life
