Summer goes
Winter comes
Leaves fall on frozen grounds
True love lasts forever
I imagine you in a thousand glimpses
Moonlight you keep me safe at night
And I know you're here if I fall

Seasons change
Spirits wake up
Birds fly away to faraway homes
True love lasts forever
I imagine you in a thousand glimpses

Moonlight you keep me safe at night
And I know you're here if I fall
Starlight show me the way in the dark
And I know you're here when I call

Leaves' Eyes

Children grow up
Parents grow old
Man's wives become mothers to sons
Sunna hides
Mani glows
Stars are watching over us

Moonlight you keep me safe at night
And I know you're here if I fall
Starlight show me the way in the dark
And I know you're here when I call
