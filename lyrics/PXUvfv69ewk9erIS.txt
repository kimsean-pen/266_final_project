Joey joey
You have never let anyone down
I am sorry that
This is happening to you
Oh what is the point
Of this collapse
You are not crying
I know you are only sweating too

Joey's song in everything
Bitterness and jealousy
As long as you know i am waiting
Fever crams the skin of joey's song
La la la la
As long you know i am waiting
Passing out in the joy
Of joey's song

Slayer moon
Grief is not new, love even less so
I am sorry that this is happening to you
Oh what is the point
Embrace the boy
You are my brother
Snow will cover your path too

Mary mary
Listen listen listen listen listen
I am sorry that this is happening to you
So the light is gone

Now it is the end
I am your brother
The snow will cover
My path too

Joey's song in everything
Bitterness and jealousy
As long as you know i am waiting
Fever crams the skin of joey's song
La la la la
As long you know i am waiting
Ignorant of the joy (indifferent of joy)
Of joey's song
