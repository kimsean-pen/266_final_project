I'm driving down an empty road
There's no more sights, no more home
The sky is darker than last night
But I will drive till I see light
I'm swinging from a chandelier
The view gets worse every year
The gold is duller to my eyes
But I'll hang here until I'm blind
I pushed the button and nothing happened I'm a thief that ran out of gold
I worked myself to the bone to find I'm just a thief who's ran out of gold
I pushed the button and nothing happened
Pushed the button
I pushed the button
I worked myself to the bone to find I'm just a thief who's ran out of gold
