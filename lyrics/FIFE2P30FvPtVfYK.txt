There's nothing left for us to talk about
Thank god for ordinary drugs
Invent another thing to fight about
We're bored of ordinary love

Finally [?]

When we were young this life was so exciting
Now we got ordinary drugs
Each kiss another empty promise
Thank god for ordinary lust

Finally [?]
Finally [?]
