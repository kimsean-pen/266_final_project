All the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out...

I can't believe i believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think
She was from your past
Silly of me to dream of
One day having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe I fell for your schemes
I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me
You're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete
When you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on

Cuz I realized I got
Me myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out

And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

Me myself and I
That's all i got in the end

That's what i found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend

So controlling, you said that you love me
But you don't
Your family told me one day

I would see it on my own
Next thing i know i'm dealing
With your three kids in my home
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over
Stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes

Ain't no need to front like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time
But now I am strong

Because I realized I got
Me myself and I
That's all i got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on

I'm gonna be my own best friend

Me myself and I
That's all i got in the end
That's what i found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend

Me myself and I
I know that i will never disappoint myself
I must have cried a thousand times
All the ladies if you feel me
Help me sing it now
I can't regret all the times spent with you
Ya, you hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way
After all the rain
You'll see the sun come out again
Me myself and I
I know that i will never disappoint myself
I must have cried a thousand times
All the ladies if you feel me
Help me sing it now
I can't regret all the times spent with you
Ya, you hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way
After all the rain
You'll see the sun come out again
Me myself and I
MY eyes have cried a thousand times
I can't regret time spent with you
It's how i learned to make it through
Me myself and I
I know that i will never disappoint myself
MY eyes have cried a thousand times
If you've cry a thousand times, ladies you will survive
I can't regret time spent with you
Yeah you hurt me but i learned a lot along the way
It's how i learned to make it through
I can see the sun shine, I've got me, myself and i
