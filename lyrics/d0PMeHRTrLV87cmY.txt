You and me are day and night
Even when you're wrong you're right
Why you gotta be like that?
Do you run on Hot or Cold?
Baby is it yes or not?
Why you gotta be like that?

Why are you always running late?
It's drama like every other day
Won't haven't any other way, oh no no

We're perfectly imperfect
So wrong it's right
It's crazy but is worth it
Cause you're all mine

You've been kicking in your sleep
Selling out my favorite sheets
Why you gotta be like that?
Are you show tunes on replay?
But you know is like it's okay
Why you gotta be like that?

Why are you always running late?
It's drama like every other day
Won't haven't any other way, oh no no

We're perfectly imperfect
So wrong it's right
It's crazy but is worth it
Cause you're all mine

Ouuuuuh whoaaaaaa

All mine, all mine, all mine
All Mine, all mine, cause you're all mine

We perfectly imperfect
So wrong it's right
It's crazy but is worth it
Cause you're all mine
