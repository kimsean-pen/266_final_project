I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
I said: "Baby, I am not afraid to die."
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same now
Watch the way I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over!"
I like the way she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
I said: "Baby, I am not afraid to die."
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
That is not your, I swear you fake hard
Now these fuckers wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em
Medicine, lil' always, take some
Fast car, NASCAR, race on 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll
She say: "You're the worst, you're the worst."
I cannot die because this my universe

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said: "Baby, I am not afraid to die."
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
