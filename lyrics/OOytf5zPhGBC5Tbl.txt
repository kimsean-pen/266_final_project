Drag up. Drag up your life!
Drag up. Drag up your life!

Beauty and intelligence in one combines
Serving body to the fifth power to the cosign
Maybe I can tutor you, just read my texts
You can meet me after class, maybe we can solve for X!

Say yes to drag, yes ma'am to drag!
This lace, it pays
Unleash the diva that lives deep inside your mind

If you want to play!

Dra-a-ag up your life
(Super duper!)
Cause no matter if you're black or white
Any color, you can drag up your life
Dra-a-ag up your life
(Precisely!)
Cause no matter if you're black or white
Any color, you can drag up your life

It's a kind of crappy world and it sucks
There bigotry, the GOP (and misplaced tucks)
So smear your lipstick on in the shape of a smile
If you hate everything make it into something less vile

Oh girl, just add some sparkle
It feels so sexy and free and you'll see, yes you will!
Work the glitz and glamour, be flashy for the camera
And gay gay gay, if you want to play!

Dra-a-ag up your life
(Fine)
Cause no matter if you're black or white
Any color, you can drag up your life
Dra-a-ag up your life
(Hey!)
Cause no matter if you're black or white
Any color, you can drag up your life

Rrrrra-ka-ta-tussy-ta-ta
Yeah, I'm pussy bitch
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la-la
C'est bon, c'est bon
Do-go-choco-la-ta-la
You can take my snatch
Drag it up, will it up
Give me more, bring it to the ball!
Hahahahaaaa!

Dra-a-ag up your life
(Rrrrrah!)
Cause no matter if you're black or white
Any color, you can drag up your life
Dra-a-ag up your life
(C'est la vie!)
Cause no matter if you're black or white
Any color, you can drag up your life

Drag up your life!
(Rrrrrrr!)
