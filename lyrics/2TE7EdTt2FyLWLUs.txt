It's not the cowboys that are missing anymore
That problem was already old in '94
Don't be offended, this might seem a little wrong
Where've all the gay guys gone?

To the romance when I was 14 years old
To my heroes that were dressed up in gold
Only hoping one day I could be so bold
Where've all the gay guys gone?

If we are all in the gutter
It doesn't change who we are
'Cause some of us in the gutter
Are looking up at the stars

If we are all in the gutter
It doesn't change who we are
'Cause some of us in the gutter
Are looking up at the stars

So tell me where've all the good guys?
Where've all the good guys?
Where've all the good guys gone?

Where've all the good guys?
Where've all the good guys?
Where've all the good guys gone?

Thank you Rufus, thank you Auden and James Dean
Thank you Emerson and Bowie for my dreams

Thank you Warhol, thank you patience
Thank you Porter and Cocteau

If we are all in the gutter
Doesn't change who we are
