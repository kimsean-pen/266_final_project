You hold on every word I say
Pulling every time I move
You can't help it
You suffocate to keep me warm
'Cause you forget I need the cold
You can't help it

Feel so frosty, let me go
And it hurts so bad when you know it
What can you do, love?
When I run again chasing
You know it, know it
Feel so frosty, let me go
If it's a game I call, I cheated
Just what can we do, love?
It's a dance we both do and we know it
We know it, we know it,
Know it, know it
Know it all, know it all,
Know it all, know it all

Walking up the boat again
Hidden back to keep it firm
I can't help it
Struggling to keep you calm
Remember when to lose control
I can't help it

Feel so frosty, let me go
And it hurts so bad when you know it
What can you do, love?
When I run again chasing
You know it, know it
Feel so frosty, let me go
If it's a game I call, I cheated
Just what can we do, love?
It's a dance we both do and we know it
We know it, we know it,
Know it, know it
Know it all, know it all,
Know it all, know it all
When you run again, chase
When you run again, chase
It's a game I call when
What can I do love?
What can I do love?
