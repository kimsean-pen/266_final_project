And here the air that I breathe isn't dead
Enter life of what's still here
Close the door away from near
Shrouded in autumn's graven ascension
Thought the bridge was over now
Lost the track astray somehow
Who's painting my life in sorrow blue
A relief for a disclocated mind
Shelter for thoughts
Asylum for my soul
Finding the only place I need to know
Salvation for a lonely sinking kind
All my duties be done
A few years of take
Never leaving again you're forever
