It's breaking my heart
Every time you're coming through
Falling apart
Didn't think that I could lose
I wouldn't really care for something more
But you woke me up, yes, you woke me up
And I don't need myself to start a storm
I just need you, you
You're breaking my heart
Every time you're coming through
You pull me apart
Everytime your love breaks through
And we'll hit the mart, doing smething tragic
I know where to start, we'll find some magic there
We'll find some magic there
Walk with me, take my hand
These colours will never stray, so, understand
It's a perfect run straight through the tar
And we're almost done, but we'll never stop
It's a perfect run straight through the tar
And we're almost done, but we'll never stop
