Resignation of the chairman is routine
the scandal that surrounds him makes it impossible
there is nothing that can get him clean
he will wash his fingers until they will bleed

Run away from his past
gotta know, there's nothing that will last

I don't see why the deal must be abused
His mind probably got fused
Leaders do tend to use their powers so wrong
Hey there people stay strong

The scandal has delt a devastating
blow to their firm
it seems no one can admit it
(the) money makes you a germ

Something has gone very wrong
do you know to whom it belong
they will suffer from the loss of funds
mandatory code of breaking laws

We will go outside the system failed
to nail us all at once
we will rule the planet from today
no matter what you say

by the lord
they get floored

Make your vote
for me I will entrust
your money and your life
you can not leave my boat
until you die

The scandal has delt a devastating
blow to their firm
it seems no one can admit it
(the) money makes you a germ

Make your vote
for me I will entrust
your money and your life
you can not leave my boat
until you die...
until you die...
Get me down is all there is to you
I'm just a man you knew
And now I'm dead...

(The) chairman is
like a decease
run from pole
pole to pole
like a tick
he is sick
has no cause in this world

running from
(the) days that where
best in life
with a knife
on his neck
(from) all the ones

The scandal has delt a devastating
blow to their firm
it seems no one can admit it
(the) money makes you a germ

The scandal has delt a devastating
