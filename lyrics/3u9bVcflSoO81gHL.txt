Unidentified flying object
Hovering over the Harvard projects
If this were real I would be ready
Waiting out on my balcony

Take me away from here
I'm stuck for good, I fear
I can't move
I can't change
It's too late

I wanna ride on the spaceship in my mind
And transcend emotion
Close the door, kill the lights, lie back
And fly so low across my own private ocean

No tenuous intimacies
I'm weightless, airtight and empty
I just want to be where I want to be
I wanna see what I wanna see

No love, no money, no hate, no jealousy
And now one has any power over me
I get back on solitary plane

I wanna ride on the spaceship in my mind
And transcend emotion
Close the door, kill the lights, lie down
And fly solo across my own private ocean

I wanna ride on the spaceship in my mind
And transcend emotion
Close the door, kill the lights, lie down
And dive into my own private ocean

Oh I've been hurt too many times
Too many bad situations
Close the door, kill the lights, lie back and fly
