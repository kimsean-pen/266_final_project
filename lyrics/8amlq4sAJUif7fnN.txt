Figure eight that string
Around the envelope
Of our years that fold
Together
I penned my notes
And worked the most
I ever have
On human growth
Time had its place
Between us both
But mail stacks
And patience croaks
Some loving words
Unfurl a rope
Hot air balloon
I let you go
I love you more
Than you'll ever know
An envelope
Lost in my home
I love you more
Than you'll ever know
Hot air balloon
I'll watch you float
I love you more
Than you'll ever know
An envelope
Lost in my home
I love you more
Than you'll ever know
Hot air balloon
I'll watch you float
