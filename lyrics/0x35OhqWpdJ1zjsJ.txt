To find a path out, golden light switch, unbroken thought
(What did you expect?)
To feel the half moon from my Chinese room, through the slot, yeah
(What did you expect?)
Rather handle bad dreams, better than darkness
(What did you expect?)
Ce n'est pas une blague, demandez Ã  Edith Piaf

(Are you still afraid?)
Fall into my sleep with no choice
(Are you still afraid?)
Darkness swallows me from the inside

And everyday I ask my wife,
"How can we be sure that you are still my wife?"

She says,
"Look in my eyes! Look in my eyes!"

"Right
Well, have you looked in mine?"

(Are you still afraid?)
Fall into my sleep with no choice
(Are you still afraid?)
Darkness swallows me from the inside

And everyday I ask my wife,
"How can you be sure,
how can you be sure that this is still your life?"
