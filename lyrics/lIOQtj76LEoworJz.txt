Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything

Gave you everything, yeah
Bring it and take it all back
I gave you everything, yeah
But you don't know what to do with all that
And that's on everything
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit the nip tuck on you
Ring, ring, never pick up on you (brr)
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit the nip tuck on you
Let go tryna give up on you

Hmm
Saying used to curve to niggas like you
Skrr, skrr, skrr niggas like you
Even though I heard what you might do
I take it in concern 'cause I like you
But no, no, I can't hide to you
I, I can't lie, it's too hard (so hard, so hard)
I need more than what you got from me
You win a bad bitch, and new cars

Girl, I give you everything, yeah
You gon' need to take it all back (Take it all back)
I gave you everything, yeah
But you don't know what to do with all that
And that's on everything
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit the nip tuck on you
Ring, ring, never pick up on you, oh
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit the nip tuck on you
Let go tryna give up on you

I know how to flip naggas like you
I got plenty end clip niggas like you
Fuck around and forget niggas like you
Come and suck up, miss niggas like you
So no, no
Feeling's fading away
I can't help, would you stay?
I need more than what you got from me
You got a bad bitch, you won't stay

Darling, I give you everything, yeah
You gon' need to take it all back (Take it all back)
I gave you everything, yeah
But you don't know what to do with all that
And that's on everything
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit the nip tuck on you
Ring, ring, never pick up on you, oh
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit the nip tuck on you
Let go tryna give up on you, ooh

Yuh
Give up on 'em, I don't even wanna get up on 'em
And I ain't tryna work it out
But at the gym, on a map doing sit up, it's on 'em
You let yourself go, you don't represent all
So trust me just go
You settle for last yo, you disrespect fo'
You is bad show, the new you just dough

So cut all that, pullin' nerve off me to come up my pedestal
Come mourn at my pedestal, money orf that at a boat
Which means that back stack tide
You ain't get the drive money get your pedestaled
You said you were up, everyday a queen you slept on
And I ain't talkin' 'but your mattresses but
I'm you're the type of player I pressed a Jack on
I can't believe you played for that long
I never re-respect for nobody

I never need a truth, you must have thought I did
I should have cut the stick but I'm tough long
Press on, head's strong, sex the bomb
Dreams of a bad bitch tryna fuck the don
If it's were born any of that sex icons
And we bust down, I don't wanna waste my time
Who the fuck you thought you were, you tryna stung my neck?
Should have put you on blast like a gun whitehead
But it's okay, we gon' keep secrets nigga
Cause a true bad bitch
Ain't weak or bitter
