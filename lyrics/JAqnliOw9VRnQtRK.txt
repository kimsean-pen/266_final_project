Imagine for a minute
You get up in the morning
And get what you want
You look good in the mirror
Your shirt is full of money
You're getting it on

Imagine being shallow
Thinner than a shadow
Thicker than wood
Imagine for a minute
The way that I'd be living
If only I could

I'm no James Dean
Heartthrob daydream
Bad hair, black jeans
Not cool suits me
Girls won't date me
Guys all hate me
Guess that must mean
I'm no James Dean

James Dean!

I got into Nirvana
And smoking marijuana
My first year in school
But you don't really wanna
Get busted by your momma
If you want to stay cool
She burst into the party
Hadn't hardly started
She was looking crazed
She took away my joint said
Nick, I'm disappointed
That's not how you were raised

'Cause I'm no James Dean
Heartthrob daydream
Bad hair, black jeans
Not cool suits me
Girls won't date me
Guys all hate me
Guess that must mean
I'm no James Dean

James Dean!

I think we all grow up
Thinking life is gonna be like the movies
But enough's enough cuz after all
You gotta get used to losing
But then you stand up, shake it off
Show 'em all exactly just what you're made of
Yeah

I'm no James Dean
Heartthrob daydream
Bad hair black jeans
I'm not cool, it suits me
Girls won't date me
Guys all hate me
Guess that must mean
I'm no James Dean

I'm no James Dean
Heartthrob daydream
Bad hair, black jeans
Not cool suits me
Girls won't date me
Guys all hate me
Guess that must mean
I'm no James Dean
I'm no James Dean
I'm no James Dean
