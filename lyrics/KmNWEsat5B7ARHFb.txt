As through the pipes the waters fell
Down to the bottom of the well
In listless apathy I gazed
At the cold waters ... as he bathed

I have beheld that scenery
And it's most sensual masculinity
Yet, disappointment, oh, can't you see?
Is still the cause and the cardinal symptom
Of my sick, sad reality

Silver equals chill, but that suits me just fine
I'm shyly sipping water ... while he drinks whole jugs of wine
He likes all kinds of women, and I ... I only hate ... men
He marvels at all things new to him ...
And I only wait ...
For all things in this sick world... to end

The water pouring down his spine
Caressed his strong physique
Oh, so well-defined
Calm like a rock he stands
Oh, behold his body and soul
A friendly God must have built this man
To an all well-balanced whole

What sad bewilderment of this brought
Physical clearness, alas ...
Still so much abhorred
An ancient ghost awoke and fiercely arose in me
It was that old, savage, yet half-forgotten ideal of perfect neutrality

Silver equals chill, but that suits me just fine
I'm shyly sipping water... while he drinks whole jugs of wine
He likes all kinds of women, and I ... I only hate... men
He marvels at all things new to him...
And I only wait...
For all things in this sick world... to end

I somewhat envy this naturally beautiful man
He never knew or encountered the hatred and shame that I bear
The doubt, the cloak of disgust and the all-devouring dread
And if I told him about it
He might only shake his head
With kindly amused, melodious laughter
He then would perhaps merely smile at my ...
Oh, so stupid silliness ...
And the beast that is raging inside
