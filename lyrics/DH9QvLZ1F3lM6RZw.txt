Hello, good morning, how you do?
What makes your rising sun so new?
I could use a fresh beginning too
All of my regrets are nothing new
So this is a way that I say I need you
This is a way...
This is a way...

That I'm learning to breathe
I'm learning to crawl
I'm finding that you and you alone can break my fall
I'm living again
Awake and alive
I'm dying to breathe in these abundant skies

Hello, good morning, how've you been?
Yesterday left my head kicked in
I never, never thought that
I've would fall like that
Never knew that I could hurt this bad

I'm learning to breathe
I'm learning to crawl
I'm finding that you and you alone can break my fall
I'm living again
Awake and alive
I'm dying to breathe in these abundant skies
These abundant skies
(Yeah)
Abundant skies
(Yeah)

This is a way that I say I need you
This is a way that I say I love you
This is a way that I say I'm yours
This is a way...
This is a way...

That I'm learning to breathe
I'm learning to crawl
I'm finding that you and you alone can break my fall
I'm living again
Awake and alive
I'm dying to breathe in these abundant skies
Yes, I'm dying to breathe in these abundant skies
These abundant skies
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm learning to breathe
I'm dying to breathe in these abundant skies

Hello, good morning, how you do?
