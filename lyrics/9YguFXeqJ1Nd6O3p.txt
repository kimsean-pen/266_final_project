Think it over
A little longer
You know I'm right
It's me you're looking for
It won't be long now
Coz I'm not like the girls before

Where you going?
Don't you know yet?
Shall I shout it out?
Or whisper to you mister?
What's your answer?
You can't deny it's me you're looking for
Coz I'm waiting, waiting

(chorus)
I feel for you
Feel for you
And I can't let go
And I can't say no to you
I feel for you

Feel for you
And I'm waiting, waiting
For you

Hear what I'm saying. Are you ready?
Coz you feel so close
And I can almost taste it
Music's playing
It's time to move, make up your mind Are you dancing?
Don't keep me guessing
Coz I love this tune
And I wanna dance with you
And when it's over
You know just what I'm gonna do with you
Coz I'm waiting, waiting

(chorus)

Are we dancing? (x 2)
