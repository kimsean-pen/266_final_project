There's an aching that's been holding me back well over this decade
So I'll put together the right words,
you'll somehow feel the same
Fill up the page, from the heart I'll portray
as I'm running out of space
That's just the way it goes I guess
alone like me, putting your former self to rest
Put me to rest (put me to rest)

(I'm ready to lose everything, put me to rest)
And what strength does this even prove that I have?
To keep pushing on, while trying not to bleed out in the bath?
Like these same fucking cards that have been left in my hands

you can't choose the life you get
Wish I could be somebody else
Put me to rest, put me to rest (Put me to rest)
(I'm ready to lose everything, put me to rest)
(I'm ready to lose everything, put me to rest)
Put me to rest
