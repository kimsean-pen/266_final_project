Daniel, when I first saw you
I knew that you had a flame in your heart
And under our blue skies
Marble movie skies
I found a home in your eyes
We'll never be apart

And when the fires came
The smell of cinders and rain
Perfumed almost everything
We laughed and laughed and laughed

And in the golden-blue car
You took me to the darkest place
And set fire to my heart

When I run in the dark, Daniel
To a place that's vast, Daniel
Under a sheet of rain in my heart
Daniel, I dream of home

But in a goodbye bed
With my arms around your neck
Into our love the tears crept
Just kids in the eye of the storm

And as my house spun round
My dreams pulled me from the ground
Forever to search for the flame
For home again, for home again

When I run in the dark, Daniel
To a place that's vast, Daniel
Under a sheet of rain in my heart
Daniel, I dream of home

When I run in the dark, Daniel
To a place that's vast, Daniel
Under a sheet of rain in my heart
Daniel, I dream of home
