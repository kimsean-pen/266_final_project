You're in my memory
You're in my history
You're in my everything
I fought for you and I fought with you
I fought for everything you told me to
Now times have changed, lives rearranged
Small perforations that undo
I feel the sunlight fading
So lost and so unsure
Keep stopping down the aperture
I fought for you and I fought with you
We fought together, we were side by side
Do you remember when
We had the world, and then
It slipped away and out of sight
You're in my memory
You're in my history
You're in my everything
Every time I sing along with you
Every single word all comes true
Every single day, something new
I fought for you, I fought for you
I fought for you, I fought for you
You're in my memory
You're in my history
You're in my everything, oh yeah
