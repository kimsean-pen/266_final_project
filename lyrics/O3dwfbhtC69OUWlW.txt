Fallen angel head crashes dead out of control
Lost memories staircase twists
Darker rooms lit with left out toys
After playing mean changes toys into tools
Twisted playthings on the staircase fools
Fools weapons represents the killing game
Who taught the killing game
Who taught the killing game
Awaken eyes sewn wearing glasses dripping tap tap temple door
Locked inside scream inner scraping tooth and nail nowhere to go
Quiet retraces forcing light tears then pretend nothing blinds
Blinds closed in sanctuary closed in sanctuary
Padded walls not quiet storm's fury burnt out killing time
Who taught the killing game
Time's taught the killing game herself
No I taught the killing game first
Passing words distant pain remember trains of thought collide
No one view window
Pushing faces through shards cold glass poke bloody holes exposed
I taught the killing game first
I taught the killing game first
Tongue lash spewing red tortured animals wake up time
Beckons death upon myself eyes travelled harden
Strange no stronger feeling
Tempting motion slows to a crawl
Places his own foot in its own trap
Let go the springs snap shut
Crazy sharper teeth giving in to the jaws of death
I taught the killing game
I taught the killing game first
I taught I taught I taught the game first
