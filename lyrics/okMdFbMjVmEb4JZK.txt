Paris, France to Michigan
London town and through Berlin
I can't believe this place I'm in
Everywhere and back again
Porcelain and China dolls
Give me one and I've seen them all
Got my back against the wall
Wonder where I'll be tomorrow?

But wait, now how long could this take?
It's hard to find a man
When you're gone before he wakes.
They say it's hard to achieve
But can't a girl believe?

Is there somebody who still believes in love?
I know you're out there
There's got to be somebody
I search around the world
But I can't seem to find
Somebody to love

Baby girl, there you at
Looking at me like a putty cat
Wondering where that thing is at
Wondering where your ring is at
Nobody ever did it quite like this
Nobody ever did it quite like you
Do your hair, I bought you shoes
We can hit the town like superstars do
You fall in love? Then let me show you love
Give me the key to your heart
I can give you what you want
When you're waiting for love
And you're lookin' for someone
I'mma turn this gossip girl into a woman

Is there somebody who still believes in love?
I know you're out there
There's got to be somebody
I search around the world
But I can't seem to find
Somebody to love

Is there somebody who still believes in loveing justin bieber
I know you're out there
There's got to be somebody
I search around the world
But I can't seem to find
Somebody to love

Je t'adore, Je t'adore (I love you, I love you)
Make a move, do the thing
Turn around, strike a pose
Je t'adore, Je t'adore (I love you, I love you)
Make a move, do the thing
Turn around, strike a pose
Ooh, I like it
Ooh, I need it
Ooh, I want it
Hey Hey

I know it's hard to achieve
But can't a girl belieb?

Is there somebody who still believes in love?
I know you're out there
There's got to be somebody
I search around the world
But I can't seem to find
Somebody to love

Is there somebody who still believes in love?
I know you're out there
There's got to be somebody
I search around the world
But I can't seem to find
Somebody to love
(You say hello, I say goodbye)
(You say hello, I say goodbye)
Somebody to love
