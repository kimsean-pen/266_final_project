I'd lose everything so I can sing.
Hallelujah I'm free.
I'm free.
I'm free.
I'm free.
I'm free.

Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh.

I have lived my life so perfectly.
Kept to all my lines so carefully.
I'd lose everything so I can sing.
Hallelujah I'm free.
I'm free.
I'm free.
I'm free.
I'm free.

Ahh.
Ahh.
Ahh.
Hallelujah I'm free.

Gritting your teeth, you hold onto me.
It's never enough, I'm never complete.
Tell me to prove, expect me to lose.
I push it away, I'm trying to move.
Hoping for more, and wishing for less.
When I didn't care was when I did best.
I'm desperate to run, I'm desperate to leave.
If I lose it all, at least I'll be free.

Ahh.
Ahh.

All I want is your attention please.
Don't want your opinion or your fee.
'cause the freest I have ever been.
I had nothing to show or be seen.
I'm free.
I'm free.
I'm free.
I'm free.

Gritting your teeth, you hold onto me.
It's never enough, I'm never complete.
Tell me to prove, expect me to lose.
I push it away, I'm trying to move.

When I didn't care was when I did best.
I'm desperate to run, I'm desperate to leave.
If I lose it all, at least I'll be free.

It's clear you think that I'm inferior.
Whatever helps you sleep at night.
Whatever helps you keep it tight.
