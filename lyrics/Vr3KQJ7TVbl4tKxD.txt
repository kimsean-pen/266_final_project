Visualization

Let go of all outside concerns
Close your eyes
Now take a deep breath in
Allow an image to form
Drift more and more into this image
Let it become so real
That you can look around
And see the colours
And shapes
And all the things around you
Imagine that you're doing something
You would like to be doing
In a place you would like to be
Feeling physically strong
And emotionally balanced

Take a deep breath in
And as you let it out
Let the scene fade away
But that the good feelings stay with you
When you're ready
Open your eyes
