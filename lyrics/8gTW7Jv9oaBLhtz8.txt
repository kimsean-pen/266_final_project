There's pain on the border as far as the eyes can't see
And hell's getting busy while we're in the cheap seats
My girl in a tutu, more shoes to pick for her feet
How many lies long until we admit what we see

Blame it on love
Blame it on sorrow
Blame it on a star that fell to soon
Or Jupiter Calling, can you hear them cry
SOS, someone help
SOS, someone help
They say the victims are dangerous, what a bitter excuse
Coz now we're complacent but living a lie is the truth
A doll in the water, her hair out like tendrils
But it's only a bad day that I've ever rescued

Blame it on love
Blame it on sorrow
Blame it on a star that fell to soon
Or Jupiter Calling, can you hear them cry
SOS, someone help
SOS, someone help
SOS, someone help
SOS, someone help

(SOS, someone help) Can't turn away from the pain
(SOS, someone help) But I don't want to see it again
Can't turn away from the pain
I still hear them cry
