I slept til I threw up
I slept til I threw up

Gone are the days of
Wine and roses
They just make me
Nauseous now

I slept til I felt drunk
I slept while you had lunch

Lunch with a girl who
Has hair as
Soft as baby's breath
In morning

Lunch with a girl who
Takes time to
Listen to every word
You utter

I slept til I woke up
Then there was not much

Much to do so
I think of you
I crawl back
Between the sheets
