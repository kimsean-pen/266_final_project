I just don't feel like dancing without you
No, I just don't feel like dancing without you
Making excuses like, "I forgot my wallet, forgot my shoes"
No, I just don't feel like dancing

In a city named for a man with some awful choices in life
It makes sense I met a couple dozen Christophers tonight
Business boys backlit by a founding father bar-light
And I just don't feel like dancing without you
Don't feel like dancing without you
Criticizing the jukebox and making fun of the dudes
No, I just don't feel like dancing without you

But it's not like dancing could undo a time I had with you

Undo, undo, undo
Can't undo dances I had with you

I saw a black and yellow bird on a black and yellow flower
I thought about Pittsburgh, I thought about you for an hour
How come I rarely let my nostalgia have power
And I just don't feel like dancing without you
Don't feel like dancing without you
Making excuses like "I forgot my wallet or my shoes"
Don't feel like dancing without you

But it's not like dancing could undo a time I had with you
It's not like not dancing would make a memory more true

Undo, undo, undo
Can't undo dances I had with you

Kept commenting, "It's crowded here, it's quite a heavy crowd"
Mimosas tasted medical, chemicals felt like clouds
Kathy came and talked me down, calling me a clown
For faking my face as a frown, calling me a clown
So I juggled my nostalgia and I started to stilt around
