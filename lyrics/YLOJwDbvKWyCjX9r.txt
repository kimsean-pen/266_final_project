Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better

This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together

This Christmas
Fireside's blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me

Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer, and you

This Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town, they do

This Christmas
Fireside's blazing bright
We're caroling through the night

And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, Yeah

Shake a hand, shake a hand now

Fireside's blazing bright
We're caroling through the night

And this Christmas will be

A very special Christmas for me

Merry Christmas
Shake a hand, shake a hand now
Wish your brother Merry Christmas
All over the land now

Yeahhh
Merry Christmas
Merry, Merry Christmas
Yeahhh
