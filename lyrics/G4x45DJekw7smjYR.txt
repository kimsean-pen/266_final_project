She's glamorous
And ridiculous
Ivy league
But one of us
And she made me drop the knife, the knife, the knife
I thought I'd never let it go, go, go
I'm gonna love her all my life, life, life
Till I die and she gets old, older

And boy she knows
I'm a tornado
But she won't let go
Coz she's in every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of hope

Every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of
Hope brings heartache
When the lord has forsaken you
When death's in my eyes
She is every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of hope

I'm bueno
Para Nada
An addict
Such a hot mess
She holds me in the night, the night, the night
Never lets me go, go, go
I've loved her all my life, life, life
Even when I didn't know, know her

And boy she knows
I'm a tornado
But she won't let go
Coz she's in every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of hope

Every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of
Hope brings heartache
When the lord has forsaken you
When death's in my eyes
She is every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of hope

Every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of hope

So what have we become
Now we're so ashamed of everything we've done
Raised on strange love
We were never ever good enough

From a nowhere garden
In a nowhere city
You will see our trail
From here to mars
From here to mars
Come on

But you were sent to me
Hope breaks heartache
When the lord has forsaken you
When death's in my eyes
She is every single city light
Seeking sleeping satellites of hope
