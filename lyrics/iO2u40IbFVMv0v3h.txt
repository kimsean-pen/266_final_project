Superstitions they come
They come like a lightning rod
Happen to be a friend of it all
Happen to be a friend of it now
Superstitions they come
Hope that they include you
And me I'm the love
And me I'm the love

Before you fold your hand
I will fold mine
I knew that we were both in trouble for a long time
Before you found my heart
I knew I had to find mine
I falter just so sudden
This will take a long time

Someone stay and watch the show
Even new green people are clapping
They're clapping up their hands as they fall to the end all
Someone stay and watch the show
Even new green people are clapping
They're clapping up their hands as they fall to the end all
They're clapping up their hands as they fall to the end all

Superstitions they come
They come like a lightning rod
Happen to be a friend of it all
Happen to be a friend of it now
Superstitions they come
Hope that they include you
And me I'm the love

Someone stay and watch the show
Even new green people are clapping
They're clapping up their hands as they fall to the end all

Before you fold your hand
I will fold mine
I knew that we were both in trouble for a long time
Before you found my heart
I knew I had to find mine
I falter just so sudden
This will take a long time

Superstitions they come
They come like a lightning rod

Happen to be a friend of it now
Superstitions they come

And me I'm the love
Me I'm the love
