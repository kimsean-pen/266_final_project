Sent into battle to aid strangers in need
Gain independence, our forces will lead
Final solution when all others have failed
Liberation is coming our path has been laid

We remember the fields, where our tanks held the line
We remember our brothers in arms

When the war, has been won
And our march home begins
What awaits has not yet been revealed
What was won? What whas lost?
Will our deeds be remembered?
Are they written on stone or in sand?

Marching ashore, our target awaits
Facing resistance, forces driven by hate
Protecting civilians, while fired upon
Rules of engagement, our restrictions are gone

We remember the sea, where our ships broke the waves
We remember our brothers in arms

When the war, has been won
And our march home begins
What awaits has not yet been revealed
What was won? What whas lost?
Will our deeds be remembered?
Are they written on stone or in sand?

Leaving home, set to sea
Was this really meant to be?
See the shore of our home fade away
Facing blood, facing pain
Have our brothers died in vain?
Many lives has been lost on the way

When the war, has been won
And our march home begins
What awaits has not yet been revealed
What was won? What whas lost?
Will our deeds be remembered?
Are they written on stone or in sand
