when I fell inside out of the snow and by your fire
in this time I've learned
change your hate cause that's your slave
turn your head from your evil ways
your church is red blood flows black from your heart
we build our temple one brick at a time
and the straw I steal to build your nest
I've learned
change your hate cause that's your slave
turn your head from the evil ways
your church is red blood flows black
and when the bells ring they'll all come to see
when the bells ring out tonight
for my wounded heart
you can paint it over cause below I know
and when the bells ring they'll all come to see
there's a fire in the fields a killer in the mirror
when the bells ring out tonight
for my change of heart
