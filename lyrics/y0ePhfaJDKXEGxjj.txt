Here's a new idea
I've got news for you
There's no free rides tonight
If you're strapped for cash
I've got a job for you
My boots need shining, son

Sit down, shut up
Oh where do we begin?
The streets are full of anything you want
The city lies inviting you right in
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid

You can put your hands up
I love girls with Brooklyn haircuts
I'll be you're fanclub
Step, step
You're too slow
Speed it up

Here's your new position
There's no need for you
To wait in line tonight
Misshapes
What's up? Where's your dancing shoes?
The kiddies get it on

Sit down, shut up
Oh where do we begin?
The streets are full of anything you want
The city lies inviting you right in
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid

You can put your hands up
I love girls with Brooklyn haircuts
I'll be you're fanclub
Step, step
You're too slow
Speed it up

All you wanted, I got
Never give it up
Finish what you started
Step, step
You're too slow
Speed it up

You can put your hands up
I love girls with Brooklyn haircuts
I'll be you're fanclub
Step, step
You're too slow
Speed it up
