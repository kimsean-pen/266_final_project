Had we made another decision
Gone through our thoughts not lost our vision
Care for another life, not only seen our own
A new life could have grown
We never stopped to think
Never had time to feel
It should just disappear

If I said I never think about you, I would lie
It kills me to never know
Never know the color
The color of your eyes

Thoughts of who you would be
Would you look like your ma or me
A fathers proud only child
Kids coming back to me
In my black mind

If I said I never think about you, I would lie
It kills me to never know
Never know the color
The color of your eyes

Can't find the reason why
No matter how I try
It is killing me
Can't find the reason why
No matter how I try
It is killing me

If I said I never think about you, I would
I would lie
If I said I never think about you, I would lie
It kills me to never know
Never know the color
The color of your eyes

If I said I never think about you, I would lie
It kills me to never know the color of your eyes
