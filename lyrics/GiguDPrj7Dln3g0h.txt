We took a Polaroid picture
Lights flashed and we kissed real slow
We used to say we were forever
But that was forever ago
You took that picture back to college
How long was I on my own?
Left me with letters and a promise
But I need a body, not a poem

Oh, what a shame
You can move across the country
But you can't move on
Oh, what a shame
You've got Twitter and your girls to think I'm wrong
But I've moved on
I've moved on
I've moved on
You should try it sometime

I met her after it was over
But damn right I was looking for someone new
Been waiting for you since October
So, don't you dare tell me I moved on too soon

Oh, what a shame
You can move across the country
But you can't move on
Oh, what a shame
You've got Twitter and your girls to think I'm wrong
But I've moved on
I've moved on
I've moved on
Yeah, I've moved on
I've moved on
I've moved on
You should try it sometime

Don't act like yours is the only heart
Don't act like yours is the only heart
Don't act like yours is the only heart
Don't act like yours is the only heart that's been broken
Don't act like yours is the only heart
Don't act like yours is the only heart
Don't act like yours is the only heart
Don't act like yours is the only heart
