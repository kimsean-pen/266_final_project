Under the water we can't breathe, we can't breathe
Under the water we die
Under the water there is no one watching
Under the water we are alone

Then why do we jump in?
Why do we jump in?
Under the water we die

So many souls, that lost control
Where did they fall?
Into the deep, what do they see?
Where did they fall?
Where did they fall?

Hearts will dream again
Lungs we'll breathe in
Wash away the sins...
It's where it begins
Feet won't fail you now
Arms won't let you down

Wash away the sins
Under the water we can't be together
Under the water we die
Then why do we jump in?
Why do we jump in?

Under the water we die
So many souls that lost control
Where did they fall?
Into the deep, what do they see?
Where did they fall?

Where did they fall?

Hearts will dream again
Lungs we'll breathe in
Wash away the sins...
It's where it begins
Feet won't fail you now
Arms won't let you down
Wash away the sins
It's where it begins...
Hearts will dream again
Wash away the sin...
