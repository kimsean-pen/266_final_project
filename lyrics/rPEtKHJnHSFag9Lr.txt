Ohhh, Its, been such a long long time
Looks like I get you off of my mind
But I can't, just the thought of you
Turns my whole world misty blue
Oh honey, just the mention of your name
Turns a flicker to a flame
Listen to me good baby
I think of the things we used to do
And my whole world turns misty blue
Ohhhh, baby I should forget you
Heaven knows I've tried
Baby, when I said that I'm glad we're through
Deep in my heart I know I've lied, I've lied, I've lied
Oh honey, Its been such a long long time
Looks like I get you off of my mind
But I can't, just the thought of you my love
My whole world turns misty blue
Ohhhhhhh, no I can't no I can't
I can't forget you
My whole world turns misty blue
Ohhhh My love
My whole world turns misty blue
Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby
I should forget you
My whole world turns misty blue
Ohhhh My love
My whole world turns misty blue
Baby, baby I should forget you
Misty blue
