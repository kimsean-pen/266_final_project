On tour, lord of the flies
Aw, hey, who cares? What's a guitar?
Watch out for this one
He'll stab you in the back for fun

I'm just playin', I know you, man
Most of the time

Watch out for this one
He'll pump you full of air
For turnin' your head wrong, I wouldn't know
I see through everyone, even my own self now

I wanna write my whole life down
Burn it there to the ground
I wanna sing at, top of my lungs
For fun, screamin' annoyingly
'Cause that's just me bein' me, bein' free

Watch out for this one
He'll pump you full of air
For turnin' your head wrong, I wouldn't know
'Cause I can see through him and them

On tour, lord of the flies, I'm just playin'
I got it made, most of the time

I wanna beat on a drum so hard
'Til it bleeds blood
Pull out the heart
'Til it don't start again, yeah
