I fall over and over, and over, over, over on you
I get ill, I get ill, I get ill, you're the only one I'm into
You and me fit so tight

I go lower and lower, and lower, lower livin' easy
I don't know, I don't know what I got till it's over
You and me fit so tight

Can you do it again?
Do it again
Do it again
Can you do it again?

All the way, all the way, all the way
There's no where left we can meet
I'm into what you do but I leave you no where
You and me fit so tight, all we need is one more time

Can you do it again?
Do it again
Do it again
Can you do it again?

Do it again
Do it again
Can you do it again?

I only get to live one life
I won't pretend you're only mine
Where will you go?
Where will you find the way?

So do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
