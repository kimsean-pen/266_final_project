There's a fire in a field
We can get there, get ourselves healed
But remember that it dies
It's a limited window of time

When we can break all we want
When we can take all we want
When we can try, try, try, try

Everybody has a kid and dies
but let's pretend there is no end in sight

To the minds that give light like the Shoaiba station
And the friends that get high for the big sensations
And the jerks that bow down to every temptation
It's the fire we find in the rhythm of a nation
