You think that you know my heart
And you probably do
That's why I'm always with you
I could stay with you for hours
In an empty room
And never get bored
Never have nothing to do

You're my other half
You're what makes me me
What makes me smile
When I fall down
And can't get back, get back, get back up
On my feet

Without you here I am boring
Something inside you is triggering
It makes me myself
Makes me funny

You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low

You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low

We can find the rainbow
Up in the sky
You'd say don't you cry, it's all gonna be alright

If we ever got into a fight or war
That would be bad
'Cause you know all of my secrets
But I know all of yours
We make hours into seconds together
The weight of the world feel like a feather
Cause we're holding it right in our hands

You're my other half
You're what makes me me
What makes me smile
When I fall down
And can't get back, get back, get back up
On my feet

Without you here I am boring
Something inside you is triggering
It makes me myself
Makes me funny

You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low

You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low

You and me
Together
We'll forget what we have been told
We'll live in our own dream world
You and me
Forever
We'll forget what we have been told
We will take on the whole world
Without you here I am boring
Something inside you is triggering
It makes me myself
Makes me funny

You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low

And that's a beautiful thing
