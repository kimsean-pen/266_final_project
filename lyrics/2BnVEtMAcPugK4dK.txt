Let me step inside you
Block out all memory
Seven years in want
Watching it all slide
You with your slanderous tongues
You make such beautiful wounds
Always concealing your secret doubts
As lovers do

From god to crown
From king to guardian
From master to initiate
We'll hand it down
From lord to ceasar
From soul to mind
From master to initiate
We'll pay you back in kind

So let us be vulgar
Let us tear things apart
Let us not mind our language
Let us ruin yet another start
Hope belongs to its thieves
And to its thieves alone, mind you
This is the longed-for peace
Come too late, come too soon

Must all determine here? Why still crave
Their pardon? Call your colours forth
Let us raise this siege
I know you wished me bolder
Watching the shadows implode
A farewell to bitter blood
And to the lovers of old

From god to crown
From king to guardian
From master to initiate
We'll hand it down
From lord to ceasar
From soul to mind
From master to initiate
We'll pay you back in kind
