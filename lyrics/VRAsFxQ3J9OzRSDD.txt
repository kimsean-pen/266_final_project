Yay, though we venture through
The valley of the stars
You and all your jewelry
And my bleeding heart
Who couldn't be together
And who could not be apart

We should've jumped out
Of that airplane after all
Flying sky ways overhead
It wasn't hard to fall
And I had so many crashes
That I couldn't feel at all

And it feels like I'm seventeen again
Feels like I'm seventeen

Times might break you, God forsake you
Leave you burned and bruised
Innocence will teach you
What it feels like to be used
Thought that you'd done everything
You didn't have a clue

Yeah, it feels like I'm seventeen again
Feels like I'm seventeen again
Looking from the outside in
Some things never change

Hey, hey, I'm a million miles away
Funny how it seems like yesterday

All those fake celebrities
And all those viscous queens
All the stupid papers
And the stupid magazines
Sweet dreams are made of anything
That gets you in the scene

And it feels like I'm seventeen again
Yeah, it feels like I'm seventeen again
Yes, it feels like I'm seventeen again
Seventeen, seventeen again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something, yeah)
