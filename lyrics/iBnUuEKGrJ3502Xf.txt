I just wanna be alone tonight
I just wanna take a little breather
Cause lately all we do is fight
And every time it cuts me deeper

Cause something's changed
You've been acting so strange
and it's taking its toll on me
It's safe to say that I'm ready to let you leave

Without you
I live it up a little more every day
Without you
I'm seeing myself so differently
I didn't wanna believe it then

But it all worked out in the end
When I watched you walk away
Well I never thought I'd say
I'm fine

Without you
I called you up cause it's been long enough
And you said that you were so much better
We have done a lot of growing up

We were never meant to be together
Cause something's changed
You were acting so strange
and it's taking its toll on me
It's safe to say that I'm ready to let you leave

Without you
I live it up a little more every day
Without you
I'm seeing myself so differently

I didn't wanna believe it then
But it all worked out in the end
When I watched you walk away
Well I never thought I'd say
I'm fine

Without you
Cause something's changed
You were acting so strange

and it's taking its toll on me
It's safe to say that I'm ready to let you leave
Without you
I live it up a little more every day
Without you
I'm seeing myself so differently
I didn't wanna believe it then
But it all worked out in the end
When I watched you walk away
Well I never thought I'd say
I'm fine
Without you
Na na na na na ...
Without you
Na na na na na ...
Without you
Na na na na na ...
Without you
Na na na na na ...
I just wanna be alone tonight
I just wanna take a little breather
