They say time heals all wounds
But not yours, not yours
So now you're trapped in your mistakes
And now you're who you hate

I know it feels like
You're sick of me
Describe what it's like
Now that you're missing me
Guilty apology
Wasted sympathy

Float here
I see clear
Float away
You're always chasing the next best thing
Float away
It doesn't feel real till you feel the sting

I know it feels like
You're sick of me
Describe what it's like
Now that you're missing me
Guilty apology
Wasted sympathy

You'll never be whole
Buried your soul
You'll never be whole
Buried your soul
You'll never be whole
Buried your soul
Buried your soul
Buried your soul

I know it feels like
You're sick of me
Describe what it's like
Now that you're missing me
Guilty apology
Wasted sympathy
