Midnight our sons and daughters
Were cut down and taken from us
Hear their heartbeats
We hear their heartbeats

In the wind we hear their laughter
In the rain we see their tears
Hear their heartbeats we hear their heartbeats

Night hangs like a prisoner
Stretched over black and blue
Hear their heartbeats

We hear their heartbeats
In the trees our sons stand naked
Through the walls our daughters cry
See their tears in the rainfall
