Survive all blows, [?] on reality
Out for my blood, prepare your apologies
Your victim guise haunted my bones
[?], punch you right between your eyes

Oh, journey in a mire
You're falling for my verses as my word devours
Oh, take me by the hands
Let me have my world without you at my pet

Break me down, [?]
All boils down to your hungry fangs
I want you tremble at the sight of [?] flesh you attack
I know what you're here for, it lies between your teeth
The sweet taste of failure, in my favour

There's two sides to you
Only one that you feed
There's no life in you
But what you take from me
I turn my back on you
So you turn the world on me
I want to run from you
But your children arrest my feet
I had no trust so why'd you
Disseminate part of me
