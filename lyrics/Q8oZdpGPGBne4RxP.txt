There is a time for letting go
To walk away and move on down the road
A time for letting go

There is a time to say goodbye
To say the words then hang your head and cry
A time to say goodbye

I can see that you're hurting
Pain is in your eyes
You might think that it's ending
But not without a fight

I'm not ready to run
I'm not ready to lay down
I don't think that it's too late
To turn it all around

There is a time for holding on
Hanging on until all hope is gone
A time for holding on

There is a time to speak your mind
To say just how you're feeling deep inside
A time to speak your mind

I can see that you're hurting
Pain is in your eyes
You might think that it's ending
But not without a fight

I'm not ready to run
I'm not ready to lay down
I don't think that it's too late
To turn it all around

Don't just throw it away
After all that we've been through
Please don't say that it's over
Cause I'm not over you
I can't get over, over your love
I can't get over, over your love

I'm not ready to run
I'm not ready to lay down
I don't think that it's too late
To turn it all around

Don't just throw it away
After all that we've been through
Please don't say that it's over
Cause I'm not over you
Over you
