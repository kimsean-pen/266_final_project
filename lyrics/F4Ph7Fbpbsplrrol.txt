In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul

To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me yo
You need to watch the way you talking to me, you know

I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
And yo I know of some things that you ain't told me
I did some things but that's the old me

And now you wanna get me back
And you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul

To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

How could you be so Dr. Evil
You're bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gonna speak so
Why we up, 3 a.m. on the phone

Why does she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing goes

You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul

To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you

So I got something new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe

I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight
Into the night

In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul

To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?
