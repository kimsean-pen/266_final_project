Oh, no I'm dying world
I can feel it arise
And the thing is, I knew it before

I re-open my eyes
And if I didn't know to be afraid,
The faces made me sure that I do now
As I sit and wait, as I sit and wait

Oh no, I'm dying world
And I still lay here alive
With a black spot on my arm

And so calm, I look inside
And I see the things I always knew
But wasn't sure until now

That if it comes to claim, that if it comes to claim
I won't run [x4]
