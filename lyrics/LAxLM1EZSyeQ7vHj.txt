Cause I loved you so much
You've become every piece of my life
of my life
of my life
Look what you did to me

Does it feel
In and out of love
In and out of love
Watch me come undone

How it feels?
In and out of love
In and out of love
Watch me come undone

Cause I want you so much
You've become the only sense of my life
of my life
of my life
Look what you did to me

Does it feel
In and out of love
In and out of love
Watch me come undone
How it feels?
In and out of love
In and out of love
Watch me come undone
