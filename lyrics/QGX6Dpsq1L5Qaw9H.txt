I was nurtured
I was sheltered
I was curious and young.
I was searchin for that something
Tryin to find it on the run.
Oh and just when I stopped lookin
I saw just how far I'd come.
In this life
In this life

You give me love
You give me light
Show me everythings been happenin
I've opened up my eyes
I'm followin
Three steps fight an honest fight, (oooh)
Two hearts, they can start a fire, (yeah yeah)
One love is all I need in this life...(oh)

Yeahhh... Yeahhh... Yeah Yeah...
In this life
Ohhh... Whoahhh... Whoa Whoa

I have faltered
I have stumbled
I have found my feet again.
I've been angry
And I've been shaken
Found a new place to begin.
And my persistance to make a difference
Has led me safe into your hands.
In this life
In this life

You give me love
You give me light
Show me everythings been happenin
I've opened up my eyes
I'm followin
Three steps fight an honest fight, (oooh)
Two hearts, they can start a fire, (yeah yeah)

One love is all I need in this life...(Oh)
Ohh.Whoahhhh... Whoa Whoa
In this life

Yeah... Yeah... Yeah Yeah
I was put here for a reason
I was born into this world.
And I'm living, and I'm believing

That I was meant to be your girl...
In this life...

In this life...
You give me love
You give me light
Show me everythings been happenin
I've opened up my eyes
I'm followin
Three steps fight an honest fight, (oooh)
Two hearts, they can start a fire, (yeah yeah)

One love is all I need in this life...(Oh)
