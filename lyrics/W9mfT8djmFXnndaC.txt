Well she cried, and she cried all night,
To the sound of the freeway hum
And she swears she'll be gone,
When the sun hits the ground,
And she ain't coming back to my cell

Well she's tired, and she's tired,
Of this life she's been leading too long
And the times turn around,
Through the walls that surround,
To the chimes of a Jailor's song

Oh, but in my four... in my four...
In my four, my four walled world
In my four (x3), my four walled world

Well she tries, and she tries,
But my feet just won't leave the ground
And I'm tired, and I'm tired, of this prisoners life,
And these chains that drag me down

Oh but in my four... in my four...
In my four, my four walled world... yeah,
In my four (x3), my four walled world

And now the sun is low
And these walls try to break my soul
And now the moon is full
And I won't see nothing tonight
But the tears in her eyes and

In my four, yeah, in my four walled world
Yeah, in my four walled world
Yeah, in my four... oh my four, yeah,
My four... oh, my four walled world
Yeah, in my four walled world

Yeah, in my four... in my four walled world
Yeah, in my four walled world
My four... my four walled world... yeah
Yeah, in my four walled world
Oh, in my four... in my four walled world
Four... in my four... in my four walled world
Yeah, in my four walled world... yeah
