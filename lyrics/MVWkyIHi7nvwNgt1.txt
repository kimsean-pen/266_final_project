Keep on running in the dark
Dude ranch dream has fallen apart
Stolen kisses let's pretend my friend
You play sick and I will mend
Let the action begin again my friend
You be patient and I'll attend
Let's rehearse let's do it again
Dude ranch nurse yr brand new friend

Let nurse give you a shot
It's something to do
Took my pulse
Let nurse give you a shot
It's something to do
I could love you
I could have you
Deep sleep coming along
Like a newborn colt you found
I'll wrap it around with gauze
Dizzy reminder
Ouch, you found
Let nurse give you a shot
Don't sleep too long

You be cowboy and I'll allow
Let me ride you till you fall
Let's pretend there's nothing at all
Nobody knows the shape I'm in
Kiss me now it's just a sin
Nobody knows the shape I'm in
