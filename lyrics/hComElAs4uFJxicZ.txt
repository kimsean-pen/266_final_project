Any matter within my heart
Tried hard to find my part in all this

and I been living within my head
You'll push me away I'm sure you're sorry

Find a way and take a chance to find your love
I'm the one to make a big deal out of nothing

Where's the happy in the middle
Where's the moon when I shine
I remembered if you noticed, that I'm not going home
Every time I ever fought it
Every time I ever cried
I remembered if you noticed, that I'm not going home
And I never gonna settle if I'm waiting
And I'm never gonna roll the dice for a chance to take the whole ride
Every time I ever fought it
Every time I ever cried
I remembered if you noticed, that I'm not going home

And I never get on my page
Never fighting with all that rage and sorrow
And I, will get it in different ways
Find the good in all my days and tomorrow

And I never gonna settle if I'm waiting
And I'm never gonna roll the dice
And I'm never gonna see the light

I'm the one to make a big deal out of nothing

Where's the happy in the middle
Where's the moon when I shine
I remembered if you noticed, that I'm not going home
Every time I ever fought it
Every time I ever cried
I remembered if you noticed, that I'm not going home
And I never gonna settle if I'm waiting
And I'm never gonna roll the dice for a chance to take the whole ride
Every time I ever fought it
Every time I ever cried
I remembered if you noticed, that I'm not going home
