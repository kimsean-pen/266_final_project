And I'll take that applause
Because I deserve it
The audience is but vapor
In my hand

And I'll take that applause
Because i need it
Six-winged seraph flying
Over my head

Nothing ever after

And I'll take that applause
Because I lose it
Cherubim and diadems and
Little birds that sing

Nothing ever after

And I'll take that applause
Because I deserve it
I saw you drop
What came out of your head?

Nothing ever after
