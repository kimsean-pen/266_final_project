I'm at home where my coat's hanging
I'm a shepherd of raising sun
I believe and trust in my land
I control, I am in charge of
Everyone's future, red button is mine

Miss the times when I was roaring
in the center of all mankind
I said how you should live your life
I controlled, I was in charge, now
I think the red storm will rise and destroy us all.

Heat in the center, destruction preventer
If you release one, you release them all
You can't defend Her, kneel down and surrender
Your end is at hand, if they blow

If you go and have their way now
you will never have your choice
Catch a breath of air in your lungs
it might be your never get to
do it again because this now, this is the end

Yesterday I saw a light, moving fast across the sky
Now I see glow, left and right
Stars are falling down tonight, I fear...
And the pouring rain, eating my green lawn
leaving a stain
Never healing back to be the same

Now tell me who won here tonight
The price, of winning worthless fight
We'll make the same mistakes again
Unless, this is truly the end
Heat in the center, destruction preventer
If you release one, you release them all
You can't defend Her, kneel down and surrender
Your end is at hand, if they blow
