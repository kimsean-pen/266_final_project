Pay no mind to the stranger in the 4 a.m.
He's not the one we know
And he knows
I slept through the war you waged with him for a little bit
Until he cracked your bones
And you had to let go

So I make believe I've discovered peace
But I'll skin the man alive
And sell the meat
I'll wait in the dirt where he left your blood
If he returns for it, I can make it right for good
Oh, how I wish he would

Lost you in the overflowing fog
That's been here awhile
So I plan to keep watch as long as the wolves are out
And they're always around and more violent than hell

I have eyes of every color now
And they're vigilant
It doesn't matter who knocks
You don't let them in
There are terrible men
I'm one so I should know

Heaven smiles on me now and then
But the Devil always had hooks in

All I want is his head
And this horrible fucking world
Will be wonderful again
There's so much beauty and love
And when I eat his beating heart
I can bring it back to us

All I want is his head
And this horrible fucking world
Will be wonderful again
There is so much beauty and love
And when I eat his beating heart
I can bring it back to us

There's nothing that I couldn't do
Except cover you
When the slings and arrows came
And I've never been the same
The same
