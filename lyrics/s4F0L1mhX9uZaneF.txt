Never would have made it
Never would have made it without you

You are the highlight of my life
You are the sunshine in my night
Oh how, oh how, oh, do I
Ever repay you

Finally, I know what I want
I learned from my mistakes and my heartbreaks
The road to hell was paved with good intentions
No matter which one you, no matter which one you take

Never truly follow my heart
Made a lot of decisions based on everyone but me
But now, I'm strong enough to let it go
I'm wise enough to take control
My mama told me everything
My mama told me everything I know

You are the highlight of my life
You are the sunshine in my night
Oh how, oh how, oh, how do I
Ever repay you

Stand up, press forward, move on
Don't cry, we'll make it through the night
For sure

You are the highlight of my life
You are the sunshine in my night
Oh how, Oh how, oh how
How do I
Ever repay you

Never would have made it
Never would have made it without you
