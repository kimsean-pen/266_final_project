Metal is for everyone
stronger than the law
our band of steel eternally
a union of the strong.

Metal is for everyone
the sound is made from steel.
Bound for pride and victory
the law of right and wrong.

Welcome to a metal wonderland
where all as one unite
hear why kings, dragons, wise men say
raise your hands up high.

Return to the valley of kings and dragons
hear the warriors calling
open the gate to a magic dreamland
follow the sign, follow the flame of victory.

Metal is for everyone
stronger than the law
our band of steel eternally
a union of the strong.

Metal is for everyone
the sound is made from steel
bound for pride and victory

'Cause metal is for everyone.

All for one, and one for all
words of fame and glory
A heavy metal history
the holy book of power

Dive into a world of queens and heroes
at the end of the rainbow
under the spell of the magic starlight
follow the sign.

Metal is for everyone
stronger than the law
our band of steel eternally
a union of the strong.
Metal is for everyone
the sound is made from steel
bound for pride and victory
