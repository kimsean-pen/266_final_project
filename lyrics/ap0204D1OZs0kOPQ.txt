h I'm drunk and on a star
Hangs above just where I was
Holding court while watching over
Keeping fort, a midnight soldier

And though I'm drunk and on a star
Hangs above just where I was
Going out, mouth full of laughter
Eyes like beams, head full of dreams

Have you heard my guitar singing
As it rises from the earth
And the company it's bringing
Is beautiful and nothing worse

And I'm pale like a moon
Oh I'm empty like a room
I've gone dizzy like a ship
When that water comes into it

Have you heard the schoolyard singing
I swear they're calling out your name
And beauty is something that's fleeting
It comes to touch, never to claim

And have you heard my guitar singing
As it rises from the earth
And the company it's bringing
Is beautiful and nothing worse
