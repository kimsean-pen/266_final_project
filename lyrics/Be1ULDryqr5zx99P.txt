Today, I'm sinking even further
Straight down than I was before
I had a strong foundation
But now i'm broke into the core
Thought that I would always have you here
Right beside of me
And we'd leave so much behind

Just to be
Just another fading star
just another fading heart
Just another fading story
Knowing all that we have lost
Knowing what our dreams have cost
Just another fading story

I realize you're caught up
With what i've been chasing for so long
But now it's different than i thought of
When I thought of it when i was young
But i will always have you here
Right beside of me
And we leave so much behind

Just to be
Just another fading star
Just another fading heart
Just another fading story
Knowing all that we have lost
Knowing what our dreams have cost
Just another fading story

Yeah...
Just to be
Just another fading star
Just another fading heart
Just another fading story
Knowing all that we have lost
Knowing what our dreams have cost
Just another fading story
