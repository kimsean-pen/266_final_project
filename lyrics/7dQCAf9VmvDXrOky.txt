Surrounded
Sunk deep in the dense embrace of the forest
I imagine this is the polar opposite of suffocation
My lungs seem to gain extra capacity here
And I feel like an empty inbox
As I, contemplate the ultimate assault course
The roots, the stumps, the branches
I squint into eternity
As I try to get to grips with the fact that we have no idea what we're dealing with

My lungs will with air
I feel supercharged now
My lungs will with air
I feel supercharged
My lungs will with air
I feel supercharged now
My lungs will with air
I feel supercharged

I'm hyper aware
I shiver and short circuit
At the depths of the universe

I'm hyper aware
I shiver and short circuit
At the depths of the universe

We are the dust on the stained glass windows
Trying to comprehend the cathedral
We are the dust on the stained glass windows
Trying to comprehend the cathedral
