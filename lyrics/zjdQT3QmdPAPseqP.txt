My heart is beating but the soul has died
My body's breathing beneath catatonic eyes
The blood is flowing, set it free for demise
I've lost my balance but god knows I tried

I don't want to be here anymore in scarlet letters
Carved into what once was me
Once was yours no more... no more

An uphill battle I failed to climb
I left it all now and I don't mind
Betrayed and broken consumed by the light
Farewell to you all. I'll be fine. Goodbye

I don't want to be here anymore in scarlet letters
Carved into what once was me
Once was yours no more

I don't want to be here anymore in scarlet letters
Torn in two, a piece of me, the peace in you no more

Do you believe in loss
Do you believe in faith
Do you believe in death
Now that I'm gone

Forsaken me ashes to dust just let me lie
Lay me to rest, I've done my best but lost my sight
Turning my back, leave me alone let spirit rise
Knives in my back, all hope is lost
Say goodbye

-Solo-

I don't want to be here anymore in scarlet letters
Carved into what once was me
Once was yours no more

I don't want to be here anymore

I don't want to be here anymore the scarlet letters
Carved into what once was me
Once was yours no more
