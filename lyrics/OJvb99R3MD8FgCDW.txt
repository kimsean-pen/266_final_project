When I get to the bottom of it I see
Seems like nothing I say
Ever meant anything
But a headline over my head
Thought I made a stand
Only made a scene
There's no peace for the underfed
All the unknown dying or dead
Keep showing up in my dreams
The stand at the end of my bed
Have I ever really held anybody but myself?
To believe in the power of songs
To believe in the power of girls
Though the point that we're making is gone
Played strip down to my thong
I'll shut up and carry on
A scream becomes a yawn

Our parents' daughters and sons
Believed in the power of songs
What if those days are gone?
My memories are strong
Anyone not dying is dead
And baby, it won't be long
So shut up and carry on
A scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
A scream becomes a yawn

Baby wherever you are
Baby whatever you do
Faster than you think
The time staggers on
