Again tonight I sun is up
A prayer if you will
Fell to the floor on blackened knees
And over trees fell still

Press my hands between my thighs
And pour fissile milk
Beg the thunderbolts to strike
And mark me as alive

All the lilies on the hill
All the lilies on the hill
All the lilies on the hill
Scented tonight

And so I finished up my prayer
Row slowly and I stared
But I was empty as a grave
And ghostless was the air

I'd like to bedden down my eyes
And search those frivolous skies
Again beg the thunderbolt to strike
To mark me or else I will die

All the lilies on the hill
All the lilies on the hill
All the lilies on the hill
Scented tonight

And in the seconds before I sleep
And in the seconds before I sleep
Did I believe what I did see?
Did I believe what came to me?

Appeared the figure of a man
Waving upon the hill
To the window I arrive
Insanity and sinned

Children of a private world
To be conceived in milk
Hundred marching to my door
All bringing drinks to drink

Thank God I'm alive
Thank God I'm alive

All the lilies on the hill
All the lilies on the hill
All the lilies on the hill
Scented tonight
