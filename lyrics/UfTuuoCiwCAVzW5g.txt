Sit behind your p.c. all day long
Ragging about bands who are just having fun
Sad you haven't got something better to do
Try living in the real world
No one cares about your bitchin' views

Punk rock patrol, punk rock patrol
Punk rock patrol

Punk is about doing what you want not what you're told
Not policing the scene from behind your mask

Punk rock patrol, punk rock patrol
Punk rock patrol

Whatever I take what's it to you?
And just preying on bands for their personal views
