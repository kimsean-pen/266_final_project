Excuse me, oh pardon me
I'm still sticky on the inside
There comes a time where all I do
Is sit around in contemplation
And curse my situation
I'm just too bored for normal views
Be careful of what you wish for
Impossible to just ignore
One last time is all I need
To get my life and stocks in order
They're on the rise this quarter
Beware of certain friends
Who sell you out when everything is free
I know what I am to all of you
And I've got all these other things to do
To do

Open up and know enough I'm overused
Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused
Go ahead and tell the dead it's only you
But I am much too old
I am much too old
I am much too old now

Imagine this chaos theory
Makes all the profits leery
Somebody's showing them the ropes
We used to hang ourselves with
Instead of quiet respite
We choose the noose in lieu of hope
Oh rose red, oh violent blue
I should've seen the clues but
This song is dumb and so am I
Character assassinations
Are really observations
Stay home and ask yourself
Why am I so low when I'm so high
So high

Open up and know enough I'm overused
Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused
Go ahead and tell the dead it's only you
But I am much too old
I am much too old
I am much too old now

Yeah!
Come on!

Open up and know enough I'm overused
Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused
Go ahead and tell the dead it's only you
But I am much too old
I am much too old
I am much too old
I am much too old
I am much too old
