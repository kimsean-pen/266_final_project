You're one in a million - Oh
You're one in a million - Oh
Sometimes love can hit you everyday
Sometimes you can fall for everyone you see
But only one can really make me stay

A sign from the sky said to me
You're one in a million
You're once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us
You're one in a million

Once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us
I've been looking for that special one
I've been searching for someone to give my love
And when I thought that all the hope was gone
A smile, there you were and I was gone

I can still remember how I felt that day
A feeling indescribable to me - yeah
I always knew there was a answer for my prayer
And you, you're the one, the one for me

You're one in a million
You're once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us
You're one in a million
Once in a lifetime

You made me discover one of the stars above us
You're one in a million
You're once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us
You're one in a million
Once in a lifetime

You made me discover one of the stars above us
In the beginning I was cool and everything was possible
They tried to catch me but it was impossible
Nobody could hurt me, it was my game
Until I met you baby and you were the same
And when you didn't want me, I wanted you

Because the funny thing about it is I like the show
I like it when it's difficult I like it when it's hard
Then you know it's worth it, that you've found your heart
You're one in a million
You're once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us
You're one in a million
Once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us

You're one in a million
You're once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us
You're one in a million
Once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us
You're one in a million
Oh oh oh
You're one in a million
