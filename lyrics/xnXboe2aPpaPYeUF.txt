I try to find you in all the
Fairytales that I read
I want that perfect kiss from that
Famous movie scene
If I could break the walls between
My reality and my dream
Every day I would wake up to
See you smiling back at me

(Ooh) Had my palm read a
Million times before
Ask myself when you'll come
And knock on my door
Ain't no crystal ball to show
Me where you are
Wonder where is that love
That starts with hello

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Where is the love that starts with hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Wish love could be just that simple

What's the point building a kingdom
If there is no queen?
I'm screaming from the top of
My lungs right now
Can you hear me calling?
One day my mama told me you'd
Come and I've been waiting
For the day when I'll wake up and
See you smiling back at me

Had my palm read a million times before
Wonder where is that
Love that starts with hello

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Where is the love that starts with hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Wish love could be just that simple

I know I'll love every inch of your body, baby
Already see our future in your eyes, baby
Oh, I miss you

Had my palm read a million times before
Wonder where is that love
That starts with hello

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Where is the love that
Starts with hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Where is that love
Let's starts with hello
