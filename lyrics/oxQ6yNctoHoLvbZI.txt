Lovely, la la la, love lovely

Screwed up people everywhere
But I ain't got time to care
I feel lovely
(Lovely)
Lo-lo-lovely, oh oh

All kinds of souls down to the curb
But me help, don't be absurd
I feel lovely
(Lovely)
Lo-lo-lovely, oh oh
(Lovely)

'Cause it's not a problem of society
(Lovely)
If it don't affect me
(Lovely)
And I feel lovely
(Lovely)
As long as I feel lovely, yeah, oh so lovely

And I'm not guilty of your abuse
See it's all self-induced
And I feel lovely
(Lovely)
Everything's so lovely
Lo-lo-lovely, oh oh

All your kind are like a pollution
Look 'em up quick that's the solution
Lovely
(Lovely)
Wouldn't that be lovely?
(Lovely)
Everything is lovely, oh yeah
(Lovely)

So tipper babe don't you remember me?
(Lovely)
Now I'm kinder, gentler and so happy
(Lovely)
It's lovely
(Lovely)

(La la la)
As long as I feel lovely, yeah
(La la la)
And I feel lovely, yeah, yeah, yeah
(La la la)
And everything is la la la lovely
(Lovely, lovely, lovely)

Everything's so lovely, yeah

Won't you come along darling?
It's a surprise party for me
Simply 'cause I feel lovely

If everything's so lovely, yeah
Then why don't I, why don't I
Why don't I, why don't I feel lovely?
