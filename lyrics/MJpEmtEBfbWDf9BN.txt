Lying in bed with the radio on
Moonlight falls like rain
Soft summer nights spent thinking of you
When will I see you again

Soft and low the music moans
I can't stop thinking about you
Thinking 'bout you

I didn't know it would be so strong
Waiting and wondering about you
I didn't know it would last so long
Nights are forever without you

Curtains still dance with the wind and the sky
The sun will be coming up soon
But I just can't sleep for thinking of you
Here alone with the moon

Soft and low the music moans
I can't stop thinking about you
Thinking 'bout you

I didn't know it would be so strong
Waiting and wondering about you
I didn't know it would last so long
Nights are forever without you
Nights are forever without you

Nights are forever without you
Nights are forever without you
Nights are forever without you
