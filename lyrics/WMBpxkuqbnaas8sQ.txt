Cinderella are you really that happy?
Cinderella are you really that lucky?
I wanna know is your life like you dreamed?

Here I am
Trying to find my way
I've kissed so many frogs, but I've never found a prince
I think they lied
I was promised much more than this
Where's my happy-ever-after?

(Is the queen of the kingdom)

Cinderella is the queen of a kingdom
Cinderella got the dream she was dreamin'
I wanna know where is my happy end
Cinderella got a prince and kingdom
Cinderella got the dream she was dreamin'
I wanna know where is my fairy-tale?

Something's wrong
'cause all my glass shoes break
And no one's ever helped this damsel in distress
To hell with this
I'm not gonna waste more time
I won't wait to find prince charming
