And it feels so good...
Don't you feel so good?
Talk to me...

Hey, I never been this good, not ever, not ever
Never seen this part of me
I know nothing last forever, however

I'm not worried about tomorrow
Cause tomorrow may not come
And where my heart takes me I follow, you gotta follow

When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
When they ask me how I spent my life
At least I got to love you
When it's all over, when it's all said and done
When it's all over, at least I got to love you
At least I got to love you

Hey, ask for I wanna leave
Life on legacy, me loving you, and you loving me

I'm not worried about tomorrow, tomorrow
All I know, all the time we have is borrowed, I feel no sorrow
When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
When they ask me how I spent my life
At least I got to love you
When it's all over, when it's all said and done
When it's all over, at least I got to love you
At least I got to love you

Everybody say... hey hey hey hey

I got nothing else
I do nothing else
At least I got to love you
At least I got to love you, tel em baby

If I do nothing else, gotta do nothing else
At least I got to love you
At least I got to love you

Everybody say... hey hey hey hey
Everybody say... hey hey hey hey

Say mommy, say I love you
Papa you ready
Can you say a, how about a a
Oooh boy, whats your name, Showtime
But whats your name... Egypt
