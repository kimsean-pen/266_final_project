You say that you'll always love me
That you'll never leave me blue
Don't you know that, that's all fallacy?
Don't you know it's not true?

You may want the love they talk about
But it isn't like they say
You will find that come tomorrow
You won't feel this way

When you say that you're in love with me
Do you really know what you mean
Or are you saying it because you've heard of it
Or because of something you've seen?

Oh, don't believe that love brings happiness
Gone tomorrow here today
Love involves so much unhappiness
Don't believe what they say
