We don't even talk anymore
And we don't even know what we argue about
Don't even say I love you no more
Saying how we feel is no longer allowed
Some people will work things out
And some just don't know how to change

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole life pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
No now they can see the tears in our eyes, yeah
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well, maybe that's a pain we can't hide
'Cause everybody knows and we're both torn apart
Why do we hurt each other

Why do we push love away
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry (no, no baby)
We might watch our whole life pass us by (we may watch our whole life)
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives

Don't do it, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Some people will work things out
And some just don't know how to change
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry (no, no)
We might watch our whole life pass us by (pass us by)
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry (dry)
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't do it, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't do it, baby
