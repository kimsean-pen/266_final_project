Hey man upon the hill, up here...
I used to write you
You loved the way I watch the sun
Through my, finger

We spent sometimes to the day we met.

Can I fall into your constellation...
ah... ah... ah... aa... eye

We drove in the wind...
Opened the window

Waved to nothing...

Just to keep us awake
We drove under the heavy rain
Soaking wet yes

We laughed at it yet
And tell me more of your constellation arm...
And we danced in the room
Grew our heart a bloom
I stopped right there
You've found a new home
And I should be happy...
Ayayaya...
Uhhh...
I should be happy...
