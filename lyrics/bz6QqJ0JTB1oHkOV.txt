I wanna go somewhere where we can party up and be alone
Get in the back set of your caddy, fog it up and let it go
Carve my initials in the dust, we're 'bout lo let 'em so you know
(carve my initials in the dust, we're 'bout lo let 'em so you know)
That we were here, now turn me up
So that we gotta crank the radio

Just, don't talk about love
Don't talk about love
Don't mess it up
Don't mess it up
Don't talk about love
Don't talk about love
Don't mess it up
Don't mess it up

Don't mess it up

Just wanna uh-oh by the [?] please don't jinx it [?]
(just wanna uh-oh by the [?] please don't jinx it [?])
Cause we don't know what this could be
Don't say it please [?]
Let's turn it up and mix it up
[?] the blur
(let's turn it up and mix it up
[?] the blur)
Till we wake up and see the sun
Let's hit up and we can watch it burn

Just, don't talk about love
Don't talk about love
Don't mess it up
Don't mess it up
Don't talk about love
Don't talk about love
Don't mess it up
Don't mess it up

Don't mess it up

Just, don't talk about love
Don't talk about love
Don't mess it up
Don't mess it up
Don't talk about love
Don't talk about love
Don't mess it up
Don't mess it up
