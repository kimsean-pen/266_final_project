I've been talking about you
Behind your back
I've been telling people that I've heard things, if they ask
If we ease up and burning up, well it's a fact
I've been talking about you
Every chance I had

It's nothing bad!
It's all I have!
It's just a chance to say your name
Baby, it's nothing bad
It's just a chance when I talk about you
Behind your back

I've been talking about you
Behind your back
I know that talking is cheap
But baby, do the math
You were one in a million
And my whole heart's in half
I was never conscious of what I had

I've been telling all my stories to anyone that asks
I've been serving them up in a half-empty glass
Don't go thinking I've lost all my class
When I'm talk in about you

It's nothing bad, it's all I have
It's just a chance to say your name
Baby, it's nothing bad
It's just a chance when I talk about you
Behind your back

It's nothing bad, it's all I have!
It's just a chance to say your name again
Baby, it's just a chance
It's all I have
I wanna talk about you behind your back

No, it's nothing bad
It's all I have
I'm hoping you give me dirt or chance
If you came back, I'll never chance
Stop talking about you behind your back
