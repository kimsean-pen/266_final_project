Take everything left from me.
All to blame!

How can we still succeed, taking what we don't need?
Telling lies, alibis, selling all the hate that we breed
Supersize our tragedy
(You can't defy me, or justify greed)

Bought in the land of the free
(land, free)
And we're all to blame
We've gone too far
From pride to shame
We're trying so hard
We're dying in vain
We're hopelessly blissful and blind

To all we are
We want it all
(With no sacrifice)
Realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear

Stand to salute say thanks to the man of the year
How did we all come to this?
(You can't defy me, or justify greed!)
It's greed that we just can't resist
(Re-sist)
And we're all to blame
We've gone too far
From pride to shame
We're trying so hard
We're dying in vain

We're hopelessly blissful and blind
To all we are
We want it all
Everyone wants its all with no
(Sacrifice)

Tell me now, what have we done? we don't know
I can't allow what has begun to tear me down
Believe me now, we don't know just what
With our backs against the wall
And now we're all to blame
We've gone too far
From pride to shame
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
When all we need
Is something true
To believe
Don't we all?
Everyone, everyone
We will fall
'Cause we're all to blame
We've gone too far
From pride to shame
We're trying so hard
We're dying in vain
We want it all
Everyone, don't we all?
