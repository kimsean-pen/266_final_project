I wanna see ya dance like no one's there
You're all along and you dont' care
'Cause this is your night and
Let 'em all stare

Baby tonight
Turn the music down
'Cause we'll go dancing, dancing, dancing
Set this floor on fire
Throw your hands higher
Everyone's dancing, dancing, dancing
We'll be dancing tonight

Oh I like the sound
I like how the music turns me out
Heart beating to the sound of the bass drum
Feet tapping to the snare on occasion

Hold me now baby
Tell me we're all down with a way in
Don't care about conversation
Let me see your hands and feel your heartbeat racing

Baby tonight
Turn the music down
'Cause we'll go dancing, dancing, dancing
Set this floor on fire
Throw your hands higher
Everyone's dancing, dancing, dancing
We'll be dancing tonight

Music's in my system
I'm feeling good and baby I've got a mission
I'm tryin' to turn the club up
Make the bar light up
Dind a little cutie, cutie for when the club's out

Baby tonight
Turn the music down
'Cause we'll go dancing, dancing, dancing
Set this floor on fire
Throw your hands higher
Everyone's dancing, dancing, dancing
We'll be dancing tonight

Turn the music loud
We'll be dancing
Turn this mother out
We'll be dancing
Set this spot on fire
We'll be dancing
Dancing tonight
We'll be dancing

Baby tonight
Turn the music down
'Cause we'll go dancing, dancing, dancing
Set this floor on fire
Throw your hands higher
Everyone's dancing, dancing, dancing

Baby tonight
Turn the music down
'Cause we'll go dancing, dancing, dancing
Set this floor on fire
Throw your hands higher
Everyone's dancing, dancing, dancing
We'll be dancing tonight

Hey-o, uh huh
Hey-o, uh huh
Hey-o, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
We'll be dancing tonight
