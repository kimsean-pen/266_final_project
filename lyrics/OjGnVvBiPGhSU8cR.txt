You were right and I was so wrong
I was weak and you were so strong
Now that the damage is done

You were right and I was hard-headed
Upset at everyone who seemed to know better than me
I was ungrateful, not faithful
So blind but now I see
I was resentful, I repent for
Everything I did that hurt you so
You don't deserve it, I'm not perfect
I hope you can let it go

'Cause you were right and I was so wrong
I was weak and you were so strong
Now that the damage is done
You were right and I was so wrong
I was so wrong

It must have been so painful, for my angel
To see me walk the road of the prodigal son
And burn bridges, break dishes
And shoot liquor like a tommy gun
Now I'm just thirsty, for some mercy
It was so hard to show my face
We all remember my temper
You were always so full of grace

And you were right and I was so wrong
I was weak and you were so strong
Now that the damage is done
You were right and I was so wrong
I was so wrong
I was so wrong
