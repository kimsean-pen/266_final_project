Nobody's gonna hold me back
It's friday night
I feel allright
Nobody's gonna bring me down
It's my life
And I'm doing fine
Don't you know I wanna play
So take me on a holiday

So here I am
Looking pretty for you
They come and they go
So many faces it's no use
So I'm dancing alone
Dreaming solo
'Cause your love's the one worth waiting for
It's just like heaven

Nobody's gonna break my heart
And hurt me like they did before
No one can even get the part
Not until I know it's deep
Can't you come and take me away
Take me to another place

So here I am
Looking pretty for you
They come and they go
So many faces it's no use
So I'm dancing alone
Dreaming solo
'Cause your love's the one worth waiting for
It's just like heaven

Can you hurry up
Can you feel my love
I'm burning up
I'm so hot
I'm so hot
I'm so hot
Dancing alone
Dreaming alone

So here I am
Looking pretty for you
They come and they go
No one else here will do
So I'm dancing alone
Dreaming solo
'Cause your love's the one worth waiting for
It's just like heaven

Like heaven
'Cause your love's the one worth waiting for
The one worth waiting for
I'm dancing alone
I'm dancing alone
I'm dancing alone
I'm dancing alone
