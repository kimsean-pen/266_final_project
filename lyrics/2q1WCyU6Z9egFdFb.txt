If it's all just a dream
Then I don't ever want to wake up
I think I've had enough of this life and
I could lay here with you and
Watch the world turn
Never say a word

Drifting away on the various notes
She said she liked the way my voice hits the highs and the lows
How it reminded her of home
A familiar tone
I think we've been here before
A familiar zone
It's just
All the days blend into one
It's but a speck of a world under infinite suns
So I chase the inbetweens of what I say and what I mean
Hoping for a better grasp of the life I lead
And the life I need
And what my life means
I've wasted too much time tryna hide my feelings
Now I just want me and you
To watch the sun set just soak in the view and

If it's all just a dream
Then I don't ever want to wake up
I think I've had enough of this life and
I could lay here with you and
Watch the world turn
Never say a word

And as these seasons change and they will change
I know these feelings they will last us till the very end
As the colors start to fade again
Your heart guides me through these rising winds
But now the world's so different yeah the summer's not the same
But it don't matter cuz I've got you here
I'll stay by your side my dear
We will have nothing to fear
