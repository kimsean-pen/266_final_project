Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
Do you ever get the feeling that you're missing the mark?
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold

Written up in marker on a factory sign
I struggle with the feeling that my life isn't mine
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold

See the arrow that they shot, trying to tear us apart
Take the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
Still I won't let go
Still I won't let go

You
'Cause you do
Oh, you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

On every street, every car, every surface are names
Tonight the streets are ours, and we're writing and singing
Don't let them take control
No, we won't let them take control

Yes, I feel a little bit nervous
Yes, I feel nervous, and I cannot relax
How come they're out to get us?
How come they're out when they don't know the facts?

So on a concrete canvas under cover of dark
On a concrete canvas, I'll go making my mark
Armed with a spray can soul
I'll be armed with a spray can soul

You
Oh, you
'Cause you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

(Whoa, oh)
(Whoa, oh)

It's true
When you use your heart as a weapon
That it hurts like heaven
Oh, it hurts like heaven
