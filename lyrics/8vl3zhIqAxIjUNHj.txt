Wake up with my brain in a glass jar
Never said I didn't like the drama
Throw my bike, fall on my knees
Heaven help, don't rain on me

Watch too many film I apologize
I can serenade at your window for hours
In between, so undefined
Get me lost it's tears or smiles

Generation on/ off
Know I drive you crazy with my scatterbrain
Generation on alert
Know I drive you crazy 'cause I always change

Shoot me and save me in no particular order
No particular order, no no no
Catch me and drag me, in no particular order
No particular order, no no no

Look away one minute
And I'm off to the West
Challenge my attention, really put to the test
Kiss me now I'm on my knees
Slam the door behind my feet

Read too many books I apologize
Bad idea, I know, to identity, fine
Couldn't learn without a burn
Teach me how to live and learn

Generation on/ off
Know I drive you crazy with my scatterbrain
Generation on alert
Know I drive you crazy 'cause I always change

Shoot me and save me in no particular order
No particular order, no no no
Catch me and drag me, in no particular order
No particular order, no no no

Shoot me and save me in no particular order
No particular order, no no no
Catch me and drag me, in no particular order
No particular order, no no no
