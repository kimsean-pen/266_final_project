The clouds hold a storm over this road
You're dreaming or at least you've got your eyes closed
And this dormant love you've built inside your stubborn ways
Well its begging now, for air of the silent breath of change

As these waves crash against the highway cliffs
I'm so scared they'll flood me where i sit
Well the roads, they change to waterways
They never carry home

You pull back and You angle towards the window
Now the rain is crashing down
And oh my god, you're beautiful
I'm so unsighted, still I pray you'll hold back your escape
Yeah we still got time and in my mind these bends could be steered straight...

As these waves crash against the highway cliffs
I'm so scared they'll flood me where i sit
Well the roads, they change to waterways
They never carry home
Well, I'm sorry for the things I had to say
And I'm sorry i pushed your hand away from the radio, I pushed your hand away from the radio...
I should have just let it go
