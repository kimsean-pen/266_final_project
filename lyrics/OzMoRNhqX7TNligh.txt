Take, take, take it away
I got you by the throat

Yeah, come on

Waking up to the same hypocrisy
Sick of fighting this mediocrity
Trying to find my own way to end the pain
Try to hate me, but you won't break me

Through the dark I see a face
Another no name without a place
Looking for his own way to make his escape
But the cold world has other plans in place

Save me from myself
It's getting colder, its getting colder
Living in this hell
You try to hate me, but you won't break me

Playing the game, they tell me I'll never win
They think that I'm in over my head
It's so hard to feel when all my wounds never heal
They told me I'd be better off dead

But I got you by the throat
I got you by the throat

The further I go, this place feel a little more like home
Four walls keeping me confined
I'm not scared of the inside
Outside faces covet me
They're getting closer, they're getting closer
Dying just to breathe
You took a piece but you won't take all of me

Playing the game, they tell me I'll never win
They think that I'm in over my head
It's so hard to feel when all my wounds never heal
They told me I'd be better off dead

Take, take, take it away
Take, take, take it away
You're gonna wish you never asked me to stay
Take, take, take it away
You're gonna wish you never asked me to stay
No, I've had enough
Come on

Playing the game, they tell me I'll never win
They think that I'm in over my head
It's so hard to feel when all my wounds never heal
They told me I'd be better off dead

Take, take, take it away
I got you by the throat
Yeah, I got you by the throat
