Night sky is glowing, city ablaze
Worldwide chaos spreading like a fire
Cybernetic fingers rewiring human brains
Obedient and evil
Freedom's calling

Raven, the witness of mankind's destruction
Raven!
Raven, black symbol of death in the sky, wow!

Cutting-edge technology, a tool of self-demise
Brain-dead cyborg armies terrorize
Virtual reality, Hell or paradise?
Once you're in you can't get out
Freedom's calling

Raven, the witness of mankind's destruction
Raven!
Raven, black symbol of death in the sky

Some of us escaped to sewers and caves
Living with the rats in nuclear waste
Cybernetic soldiers demolishing our homes
Run or die
Freedom's calling

Raven, the witness of mankind's destruction
Raven!
Raven, black symbol of death in the sky
Raven, the witness of mankind's destruction
Raven!
Raven, black symbol of death in the sky

Raven fly! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
