I'm so tired of your illusions, rules never change
And my mind is so abusive, taking on the shapes
When it comes to your love, is it unconditional?
When it comes to my love, and the thing that's fixable
And all these noises, so relentless I need a second to breath

Cause if boys will be boys, we do the best that we can
Cover for our brothers while we suffer from our own hands
Boys will be boys, that's the way that this thing goes
Mothers lose their sons and their fathers watch them go
Fathers watch them go
Fathers watch them go
Mothers lose their sons and their fathers watch them go

I'm no longer taking lessons from those who broke before
Now that I am done confessing the words that left me sore
When you feel the restless pain
As it crawls out of your heart And the thoughts of yesterday bring you the way you are
All these voices, the ones controlling, can't contain me

Cause if boys will be boys, and we do the best that we can
Cover for our brothers while we suffer from our own hands
Boys will be boys, that's the way that this thing goes
Mothers lose their sons and their fathers watch them go
Fathers watch them go
Fathers watch them go
When mothers lose their sons and their fathers watch them go

Tell me how it feels to win it Has it gone according to your plan?
Do you wish that you'd forget it?
Or, or to feel less like a human?
Boys don't cry, not a man am I
Not a day goes by that I've had to lie
I was before since I closed that door and it's all white noise that boys must be boys

Cause if boys will be boys, and we do the best that we can
Cover for our brothers while we suffer from our own hands
Boys will be boys, that's the way that this thing goes
Mothers lose their sons and their fathers watch them go
Fathers watch them go
Fathers watch them go
When mothers lose their sons and their fathers watch them go
Fathers watch them go
Fathers watch them go
When mothers lose their sons and their fathers watch them go
