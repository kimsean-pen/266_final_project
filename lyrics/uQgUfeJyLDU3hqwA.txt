Look inside, day started right
A back road in a dirt town lives all time

The mongoose flies
The mongoose flies
The mongoose flies
The mongoose flies

Removed from the times
Event for the eyes
Mid day they gathered one by one
All time

The story lies behind
The mongoose flies on by
Out on the street they ride
The mongoose flies on by

Slowly turns signals high
What happens next, all time

The story lies behind
The mongoose flies on by
Out on the street they ride
The mongoose flies on by

The story lies behind
The mongoose flies on by
Out on the street they ride

Look inside, day started right
A back road in a dirt town lives all time

The story lies behind
The mongoose flies on by
Out on the street they ride
The mongoose flies on by

The story lies behind
The mongoose flies on by
Out on the street they ride
The mongoose flies on by
