Long live The Reckless and The Brave,
I don't think I wanna be saved,
My song has not been sung
So long live us
Looking out at a town called Suburbia
Everybody's just fighting to fit in
Little rats, running mazes, having babies
It's a vicious little world
That we live in
Looking back at a life on the other side
I realise that I didn't fit in
Didn't hate but I didn't quite relate it
To my precious little world

So Long live The Reckless and The Brave,
I don't think I wanna be saved,
My song has not been sung
And long live the fast times
So come what may,
I don't think I'll ever be saved,
Our song has not been sung
Long live us

Breaking out of a town called Suburbia
I remember everybody always saying
"Little brat must be crazy
never make it in our vicious little world"
Still I'm leaving

Got a van, got a chance, got my dignity
Got a dream, got a spark, got somewhere to be
Take a breath, say goodbye
To your precious little world
(Say goodbye to me)

So Long live The Reckless and The Brave,
I don't think I wanna be saved,
My song has not been sung
And long live the fast times
So come what may,
I don't think I'll ever be saved,
Our song has not been sung
Long live us

-Long live us-

Long live The Reckless and The Brave,
I don't think I wanna be saved,
My song has not been sung
Long live The Reckless and The Brave,
I don't think I wanna be saved,
My song has not been sung
And long live the fast times
So come what may-
I don't think that I'll ever be saved,
I know our song has not been sung
Long live us
Long live us
