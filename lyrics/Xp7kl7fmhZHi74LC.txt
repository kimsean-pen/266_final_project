I slide on through
I'm always floating
I glide on through
I'm always floating
Poor boy, come through, I'll always be...
Floating on, Don't want this
Rich boy, chin check, I'll always be...
Acting out, On my shit

If It's just for one night
Would you call me back
Up in eh bitch her eyes rolling back
Shake in her legs and I'm calling that
Caught me all by surprise
I don't feel attached
Numb in the vein and I'm new to that
Calling my bluff and my lips all chap
That's that
And Im ooh alright
Hand me the leaf and I'll pulverise
Feel my lungs so tight
Sweat on my brow and I'm cold as ice
And I don't play nice, till the price is right
Forget what they taught you, I'll teach you right
Now change your fucking name
I'll bet you'll fade

I slide on through
I'm always floating
I glide on through
I'm always floating
It's been so long
My lines been gone
(what) Games you playing
(I) float on sailing

It's been the same, you're just a name
A butterfly gliding, will cut you with pace
Order a star, Sip on a heart
You walk out the door and I'm leaving my mark
Can't feel my pain, with Thunder and rain
Your vengeance is coming but I'll never change
It's been done and said, just leave me the red
Drink in the pain and forget what you said

I slide on through
I'm always floating
I glide on through
I'm always floating
I slide on through
I'm always floating
I glide on through
I'm always floating
