Hey scientist, please save us
From our rainy days
Because your counterpart in the magic art
Is manufacturing judgment day

There's a fell wind blowing out of the east
Bringing famine, drought and plague
Well, now at least that's what they say

Rain fell like judgment
Across my windowpane
Said it fell like judgment
But it was only rain

Well, I know what's wrong
And I know what's right
And I know that evil exists
Sure as the day turns into night

When a man gets down on his knees to pray
You know he'll find what he is able
But chances are he'll find it either way

Rain fell like judgment
Across my windowpane
Said it fell like judgment
But it was only rain

It fell like judgment
Across my windowpane
Said it fell like judgment
But it was only rain

Oh Lord, have mercy
On a humble man
Lost in the wilderness
Without a guiding hand

Rain fell like judgment
Across my windowpane
Said it fell like judgment
But it was only rain

It fell like judgment
Across my windowpane
Said it fell like judgment
But it was only rain
