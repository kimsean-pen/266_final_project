I got a million things to do
A million things to prove
A million things to lose
But I'm riding next to you baby
Yeah
I got a million things to do
A million things to prove
A million things to lose
But I'm riding next to you baby
Look

Everytime in the morning
Fucking and yawning
I'll buy you the world once I can afford it
I appreciate you for being supportive
Girl you the babe but also the homie
Look, you keep me in on a Friday night
Used to be at every party creepin'
Now I'm out of sight
Only thing that's real is me and you
With this kind of life
Couple bottles of Soju and when we knock out like a Tyson fight

I wasn't lying
I wasn't right
Faithful didn't mean shit, yeah in my life yeah
But you turned that around
Turned it around oh
Working at this
Working at this hard
I got a million things to lose
But I'd rather lose a million things instead of losing you
This my heart and soul, you can feel it in the booth
Never been this way and that's the honest truth
I swear

Girl I swear
Oooh yeah

I got a million things to do
A million things to prove
A million things to lose
But im riding next to you baby
Yeah
I got a million things to do
A million things to prove
A million things to lose
But im riding next to you baby

Oh no no no no
Oh no no no no
Oh no no no no
No no no no

I go overseas every other week
If i'm gone too long then you come see me
Book your ticket first class girl
Not my first but you can be my last girl
That's real shit, only one i wanna be with
Could probably fuck a million girls
When it comes down to it they don't mean shit, oh no
I learned my lesson girl, for sure

I'm with you all day
And I'm with you all night
Happy cause I have to be, but that's what I want
Nothing lasts forever but I hope this really does
It's beyond fucking girl, we really making love
I got a million things to lose
But I'd rather lose a million things instead of losing you
This my heart and soul, you can feel it in the booth
And that's the honest truth

Oh girl I swear
Oooh
