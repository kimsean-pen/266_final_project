When Other People Say
You're Someone To Misuse
Shut In Behind Your Young Girl's Face
And Helpless In Your Bed Of Thorns
I'll Remember Who You Are
Yes I'll Remember Who You Are
I'll Remember Who You Are:
A Young Girl, Unchained
Come Back Here Now
I Know You're Somewhere Still Alive
Strong Behind Your Young Girl's Tears
I Know You're Somewhere, Unchanged
Oh I Remember Who You Are
Yes I Remember Who You Are
I Remember Who You Are:
A Young Girl, Unchained
There Stands A Young Girl, Naked
In Her Innocence Unused
And She Holds Me In Her Small Hand
And She Smiles Down On Me
I Am Innocent In Her Dark Eyes
I Will Lose My Heart In The Sand
You're Cruel, But You're Good For Me
And You Hold Me In Your Young Girl's Hand
I Remember Who You Are
Yes I Remember Who You Are
I Remember Who You Are
A Young GIrl, Unchained
