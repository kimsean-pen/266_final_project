My God what would the community think,
You are so beautiful, you are so beautiful.

All the things that people do in winter,
They all melt down in summer,
Things a mirror should say,
On a very hot day

Been crying in my eyes.

Vacation, vacation, vacation, vacation...

My God what would the community think,
You are so beautiful, you are so beautiful.
