No hope in an easy way
You survey your surroundings
I'm here with open arms
Don't say
A word
Fighting all your urges
You get what you deserve
Cause I know I'm here
Finding something
Where nothing would appear
Before
And I threw away the years
No point in searching
Cause I've got you by my side
From this point on
