C-A-L-L-I-N-G now I'm calling you
Calling you now
C-A-L-L-I-N-G now. I'm calling you
Calling you now

Ohh oh-oh-oh

I-yi-yi can't get my message through
Why-yi-yi don't you pick up the phone
All my love is running down the line
But you won't receive it, no, no

I-yi-yi will miss the sweet words
And cry-yi-yi if you tell me the same
What I hear is just a old, lame
Occupied signal tone

Operator all you have to do
is connect me. I am waiting for it
Help me, I am waiting to be

C-A-L-L-I-N-G now. I'm calling you
Calling you now
C-A-L-L-I-N-G now. I'm calling you
Calling you now

Ohh oh-oh-oh
Ohh oh-oh-oh
Ohh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ohh oh-oh-oh

I-yi-yi, I call you once again
And I-yi-yi resist to give in
Now my love is running down the drain
So you won't receive it, no, no

I-yi-yi will miss the sweet words
And cry-yi-yi if you tell me the same
What I hear is just a old, lame
Occupied signal tone

Operator all you have to do is connect me
I am waiting for it
Help me, I am waiting to be

C-A-L-L-I-N-G now. I'm calling you
Calling you now
C-A-L-L-I-N-G now. I'm calling you
Calling you now
Ohh oh-oh-oh
