left your face on a map
sturdied up boulders and loosened the river
to fork where it finds the best passage
met your life before us
left them your necklace and brandished your ashes
like stars peaking out in the gloam, envy
every choice that you made
lost before cause and effect found in babel
like peices of puzzles belong shackled
gave myself to the war
damned if I didn't demand that they sing such a sensible baring of your mystery
the flame might be gone but the fire remains
and I'm stuck on a path to my own ruin
did you see
me behind the wheel
did you see
me behind the wheel
and the flame might be gone but the fire remains
