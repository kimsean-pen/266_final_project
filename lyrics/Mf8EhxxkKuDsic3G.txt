I don't make money off them anymore
He said, reaching for the pile of scores, I offer no remorse
Man sat at the bar waging his wars
Onto the cats enjoying their main course
And I guess these speakers help ignore
Bartender knows all my floors

She looks as if she knows
She looks as if she knows
She looks as if she knows
My blood is good

She looks as if she knows
She looks as if she knows
She looks as if she knows

When it rains it fucking pours
Sky opens its mouth and spits to the floor
Soakin' all of us down to the core
She spent every day escaping thought
Cubicle girl scrambles on all fours
She lost her powers in the powder she adored

Somethin' in the water contorted her mind
Distorted on the border with war in our eyes
This inner city life treats me like shit
Somethin' in the water contorted her mind
Distorted on the border with war in our eyes
This inner city life treats me like

Girl, this place is evil
Its lost its love with its people
Its got me losing touch
Girl, this place is evil
Its lost its love with its people
Its got me losin touch

Somethin' in the water contorted her mind
Distorted on the border with war in our eyes
This inner city life treats me like shit
Somethin' in the water contorted her mind
Distorted on the border with war in our eyes
This inner city life treats me like shit

Girl this place is evil
Its lost its love with its people
Girl, its got me losing touch
I think I'm losing touch
I think I'm losing

Something in the water contorted her mind
Distorted on the border with war in our eyes
This inner city life treats me like shit, girl
Something in the water contorted her mind
Distorted on the water with war in her eyes
This inner city life treats me so shit
