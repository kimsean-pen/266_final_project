This situation's taking over me
Can't you see?
I'm in trouble

Infatuation's got a hold on me
A little jealousy
I'm not myself at all

I'm surrounded by confusion
And I'm lost in this illusion

You serenade me at the ball
Hiding from it all
Behind a disguise

Who's the man who's at the masquerade?
Wish I had've stayed
Just to drown in lies

Like the headline of a magazine
Are you what you seem?
Because I'm losing my belief

Cannot make it when there's so much doubt
Someone help me out
'Cause I'm in too deep

I'm surrounded by confusion
And I'm lost in this illusion

Follow my dreams into distant lights
Blowin' in the wind over shifting signs
I'm in too deep

I'm surrounded by confusion
And I'm lost in this illusion

I'm surrounded by confusion
I'm so lost in this illusion
