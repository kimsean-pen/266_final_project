Why are we here?
Where do we belong?
Everyone is a walking ghost
The people of love
And I have my drink
And I think I'll get it right this week

Why are we here?
Where do we go?
Come find a feeling that we know
Take me, take me to my home
Take me

Ohh yeah ohh with or without you
Ohh yeah ohh with or without you
Take me away with you
I'll be your come down
I'll be there for you
Now

Why are we here?
Where do we go?
Come find a feeling that we know
Take me, take me to my home
Take me

Ohh yeah ohh with or without you
Ohh yeah ohh with or without you
Take me away with you
I'll be your come down
I'll be there for you
