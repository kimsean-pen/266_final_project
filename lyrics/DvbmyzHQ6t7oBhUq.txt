You packed in the morning, I
Stared out the window and I
Struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way

Now, I miss you more than I
Missed you before and now
Where I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
(Left me just when I needed you most)

Now, most every morning I
Stare out the window and I
Think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me

'Cause I need you more than I
Needed before and now
Where I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
(Left me just when I needed you most)

You packed in the morning, I
Stared out the window and I
Struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way

Now, I love you more than I
Loved you before and now
Where I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
Oh yeah, you left me just when I needed you most
You left me just when I needed you most
