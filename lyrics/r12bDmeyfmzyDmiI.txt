Hypocrite
Hypocrite
Hy-po-crite
You're just a god-damn hypocrite

Decaying your own rules
As you continue to disobey yourself
Deceiver ... Dissembler ... Pretender ... You god-damn hypocrite

Abusing your authority
A power you were not given
The rule doesn't apply any more
You started the offence against the rule that was your own

Deceiver ... Dissembler ... Pretender ... You god-damn hypocrite
Deceiver ... Dissembler ... Pretender ... You god-damn hypocrite

Why listen to the importance of obeying the rule
Your actions make lies of your words
Yeah, 'cause what we see is the rule maker
Being ... being a rule breaker

Hypocrite!
