Confusion girl never gives or takes
Tries to cover up all of her mistakes
Wanting to be someone else
Anything but herself

I know we had our ups and downs
At times I would act like the clown
But I never really knew you
I never really had a clue
I would always be the kind of guy
Who ran around for you cause that was fine
That wasn't enough for you
I never did the best I could

So leaving me was your first step
Now you try to move on and forget

Confusion girl never gives or takes
Tries to cover up all of her mistakes
Wanting to be someone else
Anything but herself
Cause you'll get the blame
You're part of her game
Get's one up
It's such a shame

You only call me up when you're alone
Not expecting my engaged tone
But this is what's meant to be
You're falling down away from me
Now my silence speaks a thousand words
You tore my world apart
But you never really heard
All the tears you made me cry
Now it's time to say goodbye

And leaving you behind is my first step
Now I'll try to move on and forget

Confusion girl never gives or takes
Tries to cover up all of her mistakes
Wanting to be someone else
Anything but herself
Cause you'll get the blame
You're part of her game
Get's one up
It's such a shame

Confusion girl
You're under her spell
But you won't know til the very end
This trick was just pretend

Confusion girl never gives or takes
Tries to cover up all of her mistakes
Wanting to be someone else
Anything but herself
Cause you'll get the blame
You're part of her game
Get's one up
It's such a shame
