Cast dread to sever ties, enslave to crush the force
Incensed by the wretched few that feeds the beast in all of us
Long lost the blinded faith, far gone the common ground
Forewarned of this cold wind,
Still caution drowns in the dark of night

Here lies our king of kings
Succumb to rot (succumb to rot)
Quartered and stoned
Witness the judgment beckoned

Far across the fall has come, the crows of black will seize the throne
Behold these splintered lines of steel each on a path their own
The blur is all we see yet firm we lay in our own filth
Release the dragons fire to bring the kingdom to its knees

Here lies our king of kings
Succumb to rot (succumb to rot)
Quartered and stoned
Witness the judgment
Here lies our king of kings
Succumb to rot (succumb to rot)
Quartered and stoned
Witness the judgment beckoned

Now beckoned
Our sentence
Bring the kingdom to its knees
We set fire to the reigns

Here lies our king of kings
Succumb to rot (succumb to rot)
Quartered and stoned
Witness the judgment
Here lies our king of kings
Succumb to rot (succumb to rot)
Quartered and stoned
Witness the judgment beckoned

For one
A personal reckoning
For one
A personal reckoning
For one of the least of these
A death swarm for our personal reckoning
For one of the least of these
A death swarm for our personal reckoning
