I grew up alone
You taught me what home is
Saved me from myself
You cared about my health, oh

I grew up alone
You taught me what home is
Saved me from myself
You cared about my health, oh

Darling, do you know
I took pieces of our souls
Dug up little holes
Buried them so they may grow
So they may grow

Darling, do you know
I took pieces of our souls
Dug up little holes
Buried them so they may grow
So they may grow

You may ask if it's about God
You may ask if it's about love
Maybe it's all about loss
It's all of the above

And I've known unity
And I know separation
And I've met Janus
And I've felt vacant

All of the above
All of the above

All of the above
All of the above

Darling, do you know
I took pieces of our souls
Dug up little holes
Buried them so they may grow
So they may grow

Darling, do you know
I took pieces of our souls
Dug up little holes
Buried them so they may grow
So they may grow

So they may grow
(So they may grow)
