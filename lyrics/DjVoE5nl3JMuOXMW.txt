You kiss a little different now
You changed your hair, I like it now
And baby, your body still feels the same
And soon I'll be lying on the floor
Picking up the pieces
Drinking it away
Pretending I don't need ya
But right now, I'ma hold you like nothing has changed

I'm going cra-a-a-a-azy over you (Ha, ha, ha, ha, over you)
Over you again (Over you)
It's never gonna be the way it was (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
It's never gonna be the way it was
And it's so cra-a-a-a-azy, what you do (Ha, ha, ha, ha, what you do)
What you do to me (What you do)
This isn't how I remember us (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
It's never gonna be the way it was, oh

It's a shot to my veins, lying in your bed
Never thought I'd be back with you again
So, do your worst, 'cause you know that I'll always forgive you
Guess I will, guess I will

I'm going cra-a-a-a-azy over you (Ha, ha, ha, ha, over you)
Over you again (Over you)
It's never gonna be the way it was (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
It's never gonna be the way it was
And it's so cra-a-a-a-azy, what you do (Ha, ha, ha, ha, what you do)
What you do to me (What you do)
This isn't how I remember us (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
It's never gonna be the way it was, oh

You know, I still want you, baby
We both know, we both know
We will never be the same

I'm going cra-a-a-azy over you (Ha, ha, ha, ha, over you)
Over you again, oh yeah (Over you)
It's never gonna be the way it was, oh (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
It's never gonna be the way it was

I'm going cra-a-a-a-a-azy over you, babe (Ha, ha, ha, ha, over you)
Over you again, baby (Over you)

This isn't how I remember us, no, baby (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
It's never gonna be the way it was

I'm going cra-a-a-a-a-azy, what you do (Ha, ha, ha, ha, what you do)
What you do to me, baby (What you do)

This isn't how I remember us (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
It's never gonna be the way it was
