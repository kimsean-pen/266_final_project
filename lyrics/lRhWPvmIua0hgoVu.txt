Our love was just a flash in the pan
Blowing away with the first morning rain
But those flames can kill a man
And now the rain can wash my pain

Now even without a witness to see
Even if we sink into oblivion sea
There's a story about you and me
There's a story about you and me

And I will see you around this town sometimes
And we will shake hands just like a friend and that's all right

Our love was just a flash in the pan
Blowing away with the first morning rain
But those flames can kill a man
And now the rain can wash my pain

We might never talk about it all again
Might never understand what really meant
But I'll know and so will you
There's a story about you and me

And I will see you around this town sometimes
And we will shake hands just like a friend and that's all right

And I will see you around this town sometimes
And we will shake hands just like a friend and that's just fine

And I will see you around this town sometimes
And we will shake hands just like a friend and that's just fine
