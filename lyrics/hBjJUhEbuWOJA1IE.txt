I was gonna give you all of my time
More time
More time
I was gonna go and get you more time
More time
More time
I was gonna give you more and more time
I ain't lying
I was gonna give you loads of more time
My time
It's my time
How am I gonna get you out of my mind?
More time
More time
How am I gonna get you out of my mind?
More time
More time
I was gonna give us more and more time
I ain't lying
I ain't lying
I was gonna get you more and more time
I ain't lying
I ain't lying
Every bit assaulted, but lauded, and part of the profits
On account of the coffin
Don't call me a maudlin
Tongue knotted often
Do you remember when we went and took apart your closet?
Took apart your closet
More time
Then I was gonna go and get you more time
More time
More time
More time
More time
My time
More time
More time
Our time
I was gonna put it in my pocket
For every drying socket
But hocked it when I marked it
When you're alone
I gave you all of my time
But you really want
But you really want
But you really want
More time
More time
But you really want
More
More space
But I can't
But I can't
But I can't
But I can't
But I can't
But I can't
But I can't
But I can't
But I can't
But I can't
But I can't
But I can't
But I can't
