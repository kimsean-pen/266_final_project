I see you've torn yourself apart again
Mayday: razor, razor blade
Oh, how my heart sinks
Faster and faster as the clock spins
You cross your fingers as your promise lingers
But you never ever think twice
Your word was bond, now it's worth shit
Not that you ever even give a fuck

Lie to me, lie about me
I'll be your favorite secret
Like when we fell in love and never told a soul
Lie to me, lie about me
I'll be your favorite secret
Like when we fell in love and never told a soul

Wait stop, don't go now
There's no chance that I'm turning around
I don't do well with these type of moments
And I'm even worse at slowing down

I am your favorite secret
I am your darkest demon
I am your greatest weakness
I am everything you're keeping inside

Lie to me, lie about me
I'll be your favorite secret
Like when we fell in love and never told a soul
Lie to me, lie about me
I'll be your favorite secret
Like when we fell in love and never told a soul

Lie to me, lie about me
Lie to me, lie to me, lie to me

Lie to me, lie about me
I'll be your favorite secret
Like when we fell in love and never told a soul
Lie to me, lie about me
I'll be your favorite secret
Like when we fell in love and never told a soul
