Where's the love we had
When did it go bad or am I just insecure
I give all I can, baby, I'm your man
Tell me what we're in this for, remind me

I can't go on, I know not what to do
My heart is worn, I feel as if I'm through
Please believe in me 'cause what I need
Is for you to believe in me

Countless sleepless nights, never ending fights
I'm trying to make your dreams come true
I will sacrifice to find paradise
But I need to know that you're behind me

I can't go on, I know not what to do
My heart is worn, I feel as if I'm through
Please believe in me 'cause what I need
Is for you to believe in me

I can't go on, I know not what to do
My heart is worn, I feel as if I'm through
Please believe in me 'cause what I need
Is for you to believe in me

I can't go on, I know not what to do
My heart is worn, I feel as if I'm through
Please believe in me 'cause what I need
Is for you to believe in me

To believe in me
To believe in me
To believe in me
To believe in me
