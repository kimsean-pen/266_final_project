Yeah they tried to stop me
But it was too late
Oh there's no interfering my fate
They was trying to hold me
In every way
Thinking I've taken everything I could take

Everybody's challenge turning into mine
And overcame adversity

With my head high
My
Make a stand with my head high
My
I'm not afraid to love
I'm not afraid to try
I'm not afraid to fly
With my head high
My

No it wasn't easy
But everyday
Oh I took one step closer to change
They didn't wanna see me
Break these chains
Being more than just a name and a face

昨日も 明日も 越えて
更に そのもっと先へ

With my head high
My
Make a stand with my head high
My
I'm not afraid to love
I'm not afraid to try
I'm not afraid to fly
With my head high
My

With my head high
My
Make a stand with my head high
My

With my head high
My
Make a stand with my head high
My
I'm not afraid to love
I'm not afraid to try
I'm not afraid to fly
With my head high
My
