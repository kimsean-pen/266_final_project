I went down to the water
Like a lamb to the slaughter
And didn't know what was waiting for me there

Nobody warned me
Nobody told me
My excuse is I wasn't prepared

I drank deep from the river
And sealed up my fate
I should have seen the trap, baby
Before it was too late

We go down
We go down
We go down
It's the only way out

Who is this fool
Who believed all the stories
I wish I could say, it's not me

You polluted my head
With all the things that you said
I became what you wanted to see

All of these years
I've built up this hate
I had my chance coming
But now it's too late

We go down
We go down
We go down
It's the only way out

We go down
We go down
We go down
It's the only way out

I drank deep from the river
And sealed up my fate
I had my chance coming
But now it's too late

We go down
We go down
We go down
It's the only way out

We go down
We go down
We go down
It's the only way out

Down, is the only way out
Down, is the only way out
Down, is the only way out
