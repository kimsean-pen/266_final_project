wow! uh oh

I am a figure of fun
obsessive, dead-pan and moribund
[creantic girl] seasick
I am the figure of fun

[?] I baked in the sun
I have no luck in love
I have no luck in anything
I am a figure of fun

and I'm impressed by everyone
but I impress no-one
it's irritating
I am a figure of fun

ROCK!

I am a figure of fun
I have money
but money isn't everything to a figure of
fun fun fun fun fun fun...
I love you baby fun fun fun...
