You said you'd never ever live a life of pretending
But the lights in my room are so loud
Bad dreams in the summer
And I was never enough
Never enough on my own

I hear your name
Out in the streets and alleyways
I see you face in every little bit of rain
Always out of reach
Close enough for me

And the more you try to be yourself
The more you turn into someone else
You carry the world on your shoulders
If I could do it again
I'd do it again on my own

I hear your name
Out in the streets and alleyways
I see you face in every little bit of rain
Always out of reach
Close enough for...
No sleep in the city

Slow trains passing by
No lights in your building
No sleep tonight
I hear your name
Out in the streets and alleyways
I see you face in every little bit of rain
Always out of reach
Close enough for me
