Eyes, like a sunrise
Like a rainfall down my soul
And I wonder
I wonder why you look at me like that?
What you're thinking?
What's behind?

Don't tell me, but it feels like love

I'm gonna take this moment
And make it last forever
I'm gonna give my heart away
And pray we'll stay together
'Cause you're the one good reason
You're the only girl that I need
'Cause you're more beautiful than I have ever seen
(Oh yeah)
I'm gonna take this night
And make it evergreen

Touch, like an angel
Like a velvet to my skin
And I wonder
I wonder why you wanna stay the night
What you're dreaming
What's behind?

Don't tell me, but it feels like love

I'm gonna take this moment
And make it last forever
I'm gonna give my heart away
And pray we'll stay together
'Cause you're the one good reason
You're the only girl that I need
'Cause you're more beautiful than I have ever seen
(Oh yeah)
I'm gonna take this night
And make it evergreen

We can make it last forever more
(Don't tell me, but it feels like love)

I'm gonna take this moment
And make it last forever
I'm gonna give my heart away
And pray we'll stay together, yeah
'Cause you're the one good reason
You're the only girl that I need
'Cause you're more beautiful than I have ever seen

I'm gonna take this moment
Make it last forever
I'm gonna give my heart away
And pray we'll stay together, yeah
'Cause you're the one good reason
You're the only girl that I need
'Cause you're more beautiful than I have ever seen
I'm gonna take this night
And make it evergreen
Oh yeah, yeah
And make it evergreen
