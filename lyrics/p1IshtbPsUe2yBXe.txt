Oh, babe, I love the way you slide
Stay with me
Slide all the time, don't go
Love the way you smile
Stay with me
Smile all the time, don't go
Love the way you're mine
Stay with me
Hold me all of the time

Oh, babe, I love the way you slide
Stay with me
Slide all the time, don't go
Love the way you smile
Stay with me
Smile all the time, don't go
Love the way you're mine
Stay with me
Hold me all of the time

Oh, babe, I love it when you slide
Stay with me
I love the way you're mine
Don't go
Love it when you smile
Stay with me
I love it when you're mine
Don't go
You make it all so fine
You make it all so fine
You make it all so fine
You make it all so fine
You make it all so fine
