I'll go wherever you go
Chasing through the streets of Monaco
I'll run wherever you are, are
I trust the rivers lead me to your heart

Every night every day
(Whatever the world the story of us takes me)
Lost in the light of your flame
(Whatever girl, whatever you need baby)
Nothing will get in my way
(Not a thing)
Oh, even if the brightest star burns out tonight

Why don't you close your eyes?
And we can leave it all behind
Wake up in paradise
Where the sunset never dies
We'll never say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Don't ever say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

(Never say, never never say)
Never say bye
Never ask why
Baby, don't you know we're the stars in the sky
So never say never
'Cause never don't fly
Baby, don't you know we're the stars in the sky

I'll go wherever you go
To win your heart, princess of Monaco
Daylight never seems to fade away
When I feel your love raining on my parade
Every night every day
(Whatever the world the story of us takes me)
Lost in the light of your flame
(Whatever girl, whatever you need baby)
Nothing will get in my way
(Not a thing)
Oh, even if the brightest star burns out tonight

Why don't you close your eyes?
And we can leave it all behind
Wake up in paradise
Where the sunset never dies
We'll never say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Don't ever say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

(Never say, never never say)
Never say bye
Never ask why
Baby, don't you know we're the stars in the sky
So never say never
'Cause never don't fly
Baby, don't you know we're the stars in the sky

You hear me calling your name
But I don't know if
All my words are drifting away
Oh
You hear me calling your name
Won't let you down
If the sun falls from the sky
Or if the brightest star burns out tonight
Why don't you close your eyes?
And we can leave it all behind
Wake up in paradise
Where the sunset never dies
We'll never say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Don't ever say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Why don't you close your eyes? (Close your eyes)
And we can leave it all behind
Wake up in paradise (Paradise)
Where the sunset never dies
We'll never say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Don't ever say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

(Never say, never never say)
Never say bye
Never ask why
Baby, don't you know we're the stars in the sky
So never say never
'Cause never don't fly
Baby, don't you know we're the stars in the sky
