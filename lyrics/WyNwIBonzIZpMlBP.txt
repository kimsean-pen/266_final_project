You can make money, you can make good friends
You make mistakes and you can make amends
You can make it easy when push comes to shove but
You can't make love

You can make advances, you can make big plans
Plant sloppy kisses all over her hands
You can tell her everything you're dreamin' of but
You can't make love

Love's a little word that's been kicked around
Used too much, beaten down
What in the world were you thinkin' of?
You can't make love

You can go through the motions with your magic spells
Buy all the potions that Fifth Avenue sells
You can try to call down all the stars above but
You can't make love

You can buy her diamonds, you can go out in style
You can make a promise, you can walk down the aisle
You can make a life for her that fits like a glove but
You can' t make love
You can't make love,
You can't make love

What in the world are you thinkin' of boy?
You can't make love

Oh, it takes so long
You gotta be strong before it's gone
What in the world were you thinkin' of boy?
You can't make love

Oh, it takes so long
You gotta be strong before it's gone
What in the world were you thinkin' of boy?
You can't make love

Oh, it takes you so long
You gotta be strong before it's gone
What in the world were you thinkin' of boy?
You can't make love

Oh, it takes you so long
You gotta be strong before it's gone
