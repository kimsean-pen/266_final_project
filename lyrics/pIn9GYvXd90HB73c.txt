Cooling breeze from a summer day
Hearing echoes from your heart
Learning how to recompose the words
Let time just fly

Joyfull sea-gulls roaming on the shore
Not a single note will sound
Raise my head after I dry my face
Let time just fly

Recalling
Retreating
Returning
Retreaving
A small talk
Your missing
More clever
But older now

A leader
A learner
A lawful beginner
A lodger of lunacy
So lucid in the jungle
A helper
A sinner
A scarecrow's agonizing smile

Oh! Minutes go round and round
Inside my head
Oh! My chest will now explode
Falling into pieces
Rain breaks on the ground-blood!

One minute forever
A sinner regretting
My vulgar misery ends

ride the winds of a brand new day
High where mountains stand
Found my hope and pride again
Rebirth of a man
(And I) ride the winds of a brand new day
High where mountains stand
Found my hope and pride again
Rebirth of a man
Time to fly...
