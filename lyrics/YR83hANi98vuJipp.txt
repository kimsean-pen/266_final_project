Just another party where the people dance alone
Everybody's trying to have some fun
Neonlights are buzzing round my head
I feel the sense of me
The sublime after-glow of inner peace
Just a tiny point lost in the universe
Shaking my knees
Turn me on, oh my!
I still have a body
I come to see the world inside
Where I won't feel the breeze
But there's one thing I don't believe in and it's you
'cause I feel like I'm nothing in the world

Maybe

Chemicals, chemicals

are losing
Maybe
Chemicals, chemicals
are losing you
Somewhere in my head there is a little crack
The painful track of what I could have done before you came along

A strange regret is what I get
The tables are turned

We're all gonna burn
I breathe no air and everyone is there for me
If only I could see
Please let me see again
When trouble comes I know for sure
the distance in your eye
I should be on your side
And you're cold cold like death
I opened the door
This time
Let us shine
Let us shine
