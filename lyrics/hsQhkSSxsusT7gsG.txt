A juxtapositioning fate
Find our mutual coordinate

Moments of clarity are so rare
I better document this
At last the view is fierce
All that matters is

Who is open chested
And who has coagulated
Who can share
And who has shut down the chances

Show me emotional respect respect respect
I have emotional needs needs
I wish to synchronize our feelings our feelings

What is it that i have
That makes me feel your pain
Like milking a stone
To get you to say it

Who is open
And who has shut up
And if one feels closed
How does one stay open
We have emotional needs needs needs
I only wish to synchronize our feelings our feelings
Show some emotional respect respect
A juxtapositioning fate
Find our mutual coordinate
