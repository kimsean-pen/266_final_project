Hush, hush, ashes and dust
Trouble's not worth the pleasure but I feel alive
Lust, lust, never enough
Indelible human nature keeps me up at night

It's a pretty fixation
It's a pretty fixation
But it's a wicked temptation
It's a wicked temptation

I know this love will tear me to pieces
I know his hands will dig up my secrets
It's in your eyes, ah, you fucking liar
I know this love will tear me to pieces

Bang, bang, fire away
The rapture's trying to kill me
Pulsing through my heart
And pain, pain, always the same
Beautiful hurts like crazy when it falls apart

It's a pretty fixation
It's a pretty fixation
But it's a wicked temptation
It's a wicked temptation

I know this love will tear me to pieces
I know his hands will dig up my secrets
It's in your eyes, ah, you fucking liar
I know this love will tear me to pieces

It's a pretty fixation
It's a pretty fixation
But it's a wicked temptation
It's a wicked temptation
It's a pretty fixation
It's a pretty fixation
But it's a wicked temptation
It's a wicked temptation

I know this love will tear me to pieces
I know his hands will dig up my secrets
It's in your eyes, ah, you fucking liar
I know this love will tear me to pieces
I know this love will tear me to pieces
