I have a place to go
High up on the plateau
Miles away but I'm sure
A mole digged a hole
Going down so low
Are you falling from your toes?

Don't you hold my hand as I walk away
Don't you hold my hand as I walk away

Don't you hold my hand as I walk away
Don't you hold my hand as I walk away

I have a thing to show
High up on the plateau
The milky way is white as snow
Now you want more
From a blind mole
Are you following this folklore?

Don't you hold my hand as I walk away
Don't you hold my hand as I walk away

Don't you hold my hand as I walk away
Don't you hold my hand as I walk away

And the rain falls down
And the rain falls down

And the rain falls down
And the rain falls down
