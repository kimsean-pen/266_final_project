Finer worlds that you uncover
Plant the path you want to roam
Live where you're heart can be given
And your life starts to unfold

You think you can't you wish you could
I know you can, I wish you would
Trip inside this house as you pass by
Trip inside this house as you pass by

If your limbs begin dissolving
In the water that you tread
All surroundings are evolving
In the stream that clears your head

Come disciples to thee unending
Subtleties of rhythm power
Trip inside this house as you pass by

Sweep the shadows from your eyes
Sweep the realm of dark aside

Trip inside this house as you pass by
Trip inside this house as you pass by
