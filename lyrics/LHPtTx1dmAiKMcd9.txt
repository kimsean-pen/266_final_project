I wake up every day to see her back again
Screaming my name through the astral plane
And in this catalogue town she takes me down
Down through the platinum spires
Down through the telephone wires
And we shake it around in the underground
And like a new generation rise

And like all the boys in all the cities
I take the poison, take the pity
But she and I, we soon discovered
We'd take the pills to find each other

Oh but when she is calling here in my head
Can you hear her calling
And what she has said?
Oh but when she is calling here in my head
It's like a new generation calling
Can you hear it call?
And I'm losing myself, losing myself to you

I wake up every day, to find her back again
Breeding disease on her hands and knees
While the styles turn and the books still burn
Yes it's there in the platinum spires
It's there in the telephone wires
And we spread it around to a techno sound
But like a new generation rise

Cause like all the boys in all the cities
I take the poison, take the pity
But she and I we soon discover
We take the pills to find each other

Oh but when she is calling here in my head
Can you hear her calling?
And what she has said?
Oh but when she is calling here in my head
It's like a new generation calling
Can you hear her call?
And I'm losing myself, losing myself to you
