Coming up to the end
These feelings weren't always pretend
Review your whole life and you don't even have to die
Life would never leave me alone
A choice which way i wanted to go
And everything I've seen is wrong to make me what I'll be
Old man
You don't need anyone
Just hold on to the end
And you don't even have to look good
Woman
You do fine on your own
You're free to cry and you don't
Have to wipe your eyes
You once saved me
You once saved me
You once saved me
And now I'm where you want me to be
Ascending endlessly and I don't even have to try
Ascending endlessly and I don't even have to try
Ascending endlessly and I don't even have to try
Ascending endlessly and I don't even have to try
