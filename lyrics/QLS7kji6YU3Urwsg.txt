I'm gonna take you down to the market, lover
'Cause that's where the trouble starts
You gotta get it into your heart
There are people out there to make you feel bad,
But don't you listen, Baby
Don't you listen
'Cause I know you feel that way

But I'm getting so tired,
Of people always crossing my wires
Life's just far too short,
For miscommunication

I'm gonna take her down to the market today
'Cause that's where the trouble starts
You don't want nobody else
There are people out there to make you feel good,
But don't you listen, Baby
Don't you listen
'Cause you know they want it all

But I'm getting so tired,
Of people always crossing my wires
Life's just far too short,
For miscommunication

Oh I'm getting so tired,
Of people always crossing my wires
Life's just far too short,
For miscommunication
