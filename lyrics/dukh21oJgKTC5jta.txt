My girl is rockin' that Billabong bikini like she's sponsored
Askin' me if I can rub that Coppertone on her
Got a couple bucks but I'm spendin' them like they pesos
Might be Motel Sixin' but it feels like Turks and Caicos

Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Party all day like you at your alma mater
Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Ice has started meltin' cause it's always gettin' hotter

Singin' hey, let's party like we on vacation
Hey, let's party like we on vacation
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singin' hey, let's party like we on vacation

I got my Solo Cup amplifier, playin' all my jams
And my Walgreens beach chair workin' on my tan
This like it's Jamaica and I'm sippin' on some Red Stripe
But I'm in Decatur, baby, crushin' on that Busch light

Hey, let's party like we on vacation
Hey, let's party like we on vacation
(I got, I got, I got)
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singin' hey, let's party like we on vacation

Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Party all day like you at your alma mater
Put a little liquor in my coconut water
My ice has started meltin' so I'll take another swallow

Singin' hey, let's party like we on vacation
Hey, let's party like we on vacation
You know I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singin' hey, let's party like we on vacation

(Oou, oou, oou)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like I'm on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like I'm on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like I'm on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm gonna rehydrate uh huh, while I dehydrate, you know

Hey, let's party like we on vacation
Hey, let's party like we on vacation
I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singin' hey, let's party like we on vacation

Sing it to me
Hey, let's party like we on vacation
Hey, let's party like we on vacation
