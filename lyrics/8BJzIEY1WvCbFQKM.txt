I couldn't get around it
Messed with my rationale
Cracked me open seeing hydrogen
Burning up like rocket fuel
Under my collar
Got me like a hit and run
Off guard the way you are
So different from everyone
Going hyper speed
You pull the ground out from my feet
You are the only one that makes me feel nervous like this
All I need
And no one can compete
You are the only one that makes me feel nervous like this
I'm in your orbit now
You grabbed and pulled me in
Don't you know you're inescapable?
I'm burning up like rocket fuel
I've travelled all this way
I'm chasing you the way you like
I want to lie and watch the hydrogen
You fired up and set alight
Going hyper speed
You pull the ground out from my feet
You are the only one that makes me feel nervous like this
All I need
And no one can compete
You are the only one that makes me feel nervous like this
You are the only one that makes me feel nervous like this
You are the only one that makes me feel nervous like this
Third degree
I know you'll burn me
But you are the only one who makes me feel nervous like this
I can see
That you got an eye for me
And I wonder if I make you feel nervous like this
You are the only one who makes me feel nervous like this
You are the only one who makes me feel nervous
Going hyper speed
You pull the ground out from my feet
You are the only one that makes me feel nervous like this
All I need
And no one can compete
You are the only one that makes me feel nervous like this
