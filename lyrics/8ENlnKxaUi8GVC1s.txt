I've been waiting all night just to see her
I've been touching her, but I still can't feel her
I've been trying to get myself off of the floor now
And I'm so far out, I can't see the shore now

And it's only me to blame
Cause I pushed the truth away
And pretended to be happy
Tonight, I have to say

I feel the weight
I feel the weight
I feel the weight of a love that's gone away
I feel the weight

I've been wondering what is freedom
Is it checking out from all you're feeling?
Is it feeling OK cause you're not running
From the boring person that you're becoming?

And it's only me to blame
Cause I pushed the truth away
And pretended to be happy
Tonight, I have to say

I feel the weight
I feel the weight
I feel the weight of a love that's gone away
I feel the weight
