Yeah yeah
I broke the breadline, nobody knows
I walked the frontline, still got far to go
I mixed the water, I drank the water
I broke the breadline, don't wanna know, yeah yeah

It's staring me down wearing a crown of apathy, yeah
I'm standing around dressed like a clown
Don't know my name
You know where to find me, yeah

I killed the manchild, I'll fast alone
I had the midwife naked and alone
I mixed the water, I drank the water
I killed the brainchild, I'll fast alone, yeah yeah yeah

It's staring me down wearing a crown of apathy
I'm standing around dressed like a clown
Don't know my name
You know where to find me, yeah

Yeah, don't wanna let me be a man
Yeah, don't wanna lead me to your home
Yeah yeah

Yeah it's staring me down wearing a crown of apathy
I'm standing around dressed like a clown
Don't know my name
You know where to find me

I killed the manchild, I had the midwife
I drank the water, I stand alone
I broke the breadline, I walked the frontline
Don't know my name, you know where to find me

I killed the manchild, I had the midwife
I drank the water, I stand alone
I broke the breadline, I walked the frontline
Don't know my name, you know where to find me, yeah

Yeah, don't wanna let me be a man
Yeah, don't wanna lead me to your home
Yeah, don't wanna let me be a man
Yeah, don't wanna lead me to your home
