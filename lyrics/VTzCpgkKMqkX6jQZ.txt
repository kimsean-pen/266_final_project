There's no reflection when you look in the mirror
You're out for blood, and you can smell the fear
You need poison, like it's the only thing that keeps you alive
You hear voices, they just keep telling you you need me tonight

She hides until twilight
Then she takes control

I'm like your dirty little drug, and you never get enough
(Just a little bad habit that you hide from your friends)
I'm like your dirty little drug, and you never get enough
(Said you didn't want it but you're in a sick and twisted affair)
You won't be alone tonight
(A sick and twisted affair)
You won't be alone tonight

I give you wings when you're free-falling
I'm in your dreams, I'm the creature calling
You grow colder, I am the only thing that keeps you alive
Can't stay sober, one taste and it can take control of your life

She hides until twilight
Then she takes control

I'm like your dirty little drug, and you never get enough
(Just a little bad habit that you hide from your friends)
I'm like your dirty little drug, and you never get enough
(Said you didn't want it but you're in a sick and twisted affair)
You won't be alone tonight
(A sick and twisted affair)
You won't be alone tonight
(A sick and twisted affair)

Take control

I'm like your dirty little drug, and you never get enough
(Just a little bad habit that you hide from your friends)
I'm like your dirty little drug, and you never get enough
(Said you didn't want it but you're in a sick and twisted affair)
You won't be alone tonight
(A sick and twisted affair)
You won't be alone tonight
(A sick and twisted affair)
You won't be alone tonight
(A sick and twisted affair)
You won't be alone tonight
