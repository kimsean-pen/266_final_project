Betsy on the roof
I can't send the rain down anymore

"Uh oh!" she said.

What of this cloud?

Moon and emotion
Elsewhere is my name now
We don't dim the lights here anymore

I can't remember the words to say to you

I'm standing here on the ground, Betsy,
arms stretched out, looking up
Won't you please tell me the answer?
You know the answer, Betsy
