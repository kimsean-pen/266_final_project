Get these things out of my head

Sun is gleaming at midnight
My heart is beating
About to break out

All this time it takes to make sense
All this time and still I'm not sane
All this talk and no I won't change
I just can't, I just can't

Get these things out of my head

All that happens
All that goes wrong
It will be no one's fault but my own

All this time it takes to make sense
All this time and still I'm not sane
All this talk and yet it hasn't changed
I just can't, I just can't

Still this storm inside of my mind
All the words I've tried to deliberate
Turned me inside out, still I can't
Get it clear, I've tried but I can't

Get these things out of my head
Get these things out of my head
Get these things out of my head
Get these things out of my head

I just can't
Get these things out of my head
Get these things out of my head
Get these things out of my head
Get these things out of my head
