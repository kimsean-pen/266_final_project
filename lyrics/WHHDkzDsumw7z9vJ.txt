Mining my veins for answers
Mirrors following me down
Your face is pale with questions
Deeper that the day in

Now I will wait for much
That's coming loose up above us
Mining my veins in circles
Shaking the chains and losing touch

I wouldn't mind temptations
From the crime thats controlling me
I wouldn't mind temptations
From the crimes

This is the time to trust
This is the time to trust
This is the time to trust
This is the time, this is the time
This is the time

Walked halfway out the front door
Gasping for air in open fields
Talked myself down here before
Sometimes the truth is on your hear

I will wait for much
Thats coming loose up above us
Mining my veins in circles
Shaking the chains and losing touch

I wouldn't mind temptations
From the crime that's controlling me
I wouldn't mind temptations
From the crimes

This is the time to trust
This is the time to trust
This is the time to trust
This is the time, this is the time

This is the time to trust
This is the time to trust
This is the time to trust
This is the time, this is the time

This is the time to trust
This is the time to trust
This is the time to trust
This is the time, this is the time
