Dig for victory, go for gold
I don't wanna die before I get old
And I wonder where I'm going to
There's some way out, there's some way through

But I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm down again
My direction is changing, which way
Which way can I go?

Get up and go

You start me up, you slow me down
No one can deny, you get around
When you're hot, you're cold, you're in between
Keep asking myself, what does it mean?

And I walk that tightrope, you should know
I'm losing my balance, maybe
Maybe I should go

Get up and go
Just go
Get up and go

Face to face in sympathy
But now you turn your back on me
Turn a card and win, but you may lose
Fate only has that right to choose

If you're right, leave me here, I'll die alone
You've got the time, you've just got time
You've got the time, just go

Get up and go
Just go

Get up and go
Just go
Just go
Get up and go
