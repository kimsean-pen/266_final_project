Tired woods and ol' leaves
Try to rise above sea
They've been crouching and sobbing for days
As my garden grows aches
And the turf drinks old rain
Now their bodies are dancing always

Imaginary hands folding over you
I've been missing night time the whole day through
Call her Miss Mirage cause it's over there's not way to hold her
Pinch me in my shoulder
Wake me when it's over

Counting wolves and old sheep
Watch them sharpen those teeth
Crude from the walls of no sleep

Counting wolves and old apes
Through the glass where I'm safe
Free at last, time to rest my sore brain

Glance to fallen Grace
Dream of islands all day
Now her eyelids are silent till she wakes

Imaginary hands folding over you
I've been missing night time the whole day through
Call her Miss Mirage cause it's over there's not way to hold her
Pinch me in my shoulder
Wake me when it's over
