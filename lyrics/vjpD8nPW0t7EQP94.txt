Tennessee asleep in a ball
You look so sweet and you're adored
And you're adored

Tennessee asleep in a ball
You look so sweet and you're adored
But you're a dog

Watching my tears
Staring in my eyes
Will you put your trust in me?
Would you decide
To never leave my side?
Would you give yourself to me?

Picking up my animal
Then I'm taking him back to the floor
