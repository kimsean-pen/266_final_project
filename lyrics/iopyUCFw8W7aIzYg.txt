Disappointment, you shouldn't have done
You couldn't have done
You wouldn't have done
The things you did then

And we could have been happy
What a piteous thing, a hideous thing was tainted by the rest

But it won't get any harder
And I hope you'll find your way again
And it won't get any higher
And it all boils down to what you did there
There, there, there
There, there, there, there

In the night we fight, I fled you're right
It was exactly then, it was exactly then
I decided, decided, decided, decide
And drew you out

In the night we fight, I fled you're right
It was exactly there, it was exactly there
I decided, decided, decided, decided

But it won't be any harder
And I hope you'll find your way again
And it won't get any higher
But it all boils down to what you did there
There, there, there
There, there, there, there

Disappointment

There, there, there, there

Disappointment
