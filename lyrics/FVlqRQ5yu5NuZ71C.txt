And then I saw him in the crowd
A lot of people had gathered round him
The beggars shouted, the lepers called him
The old man said nothing
He just stared about him
All going down to see the lord Jesus
All going down to see the lord Jesus
All going down
Then came a man, before his feet he fell
Unclean said the leper and rang his bell
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head
Go now, go now, you're a new man instead
All going down to see the lord jesus
All going down to see the lord jesus
All going down
It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was a leader of man
All going down to see the lord Jesus
All going down to see the lord Jesus
All going down
It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was a leader of man
All going down to see the lord Jesus
All going down to see the lord Jesus
All going down
