I will never know
'Cause you will never show
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
I will never know
'Cause you will never show
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now

Carnival came by my town today
Bright lights from giant wheel
Fall on the alleyways
And I'm here by my door
Waiting for you
I will never know
'Cause you will never show
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
I will never know
'Cause you will never show
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now

I hear sounds of lovers
Barrel organs, mothers
I would like to take you
Down there just to make you mine
In a merry-go-round
I will never know
'Cause you will never show
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
I will never know
'Cause you will never show
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now

Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
Umm, come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
