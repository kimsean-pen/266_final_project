I wish I was bolder
Full of red, yellow, and blue
Ciagarillos in my pocket
And a doodle that you drew
On the back of a boarding pass
To Berlin Germany
Go ahead and make your money
Across the choppy sea

Now, oh hell, it's April
The blossoms on the trees
Fall like confetti
And twirl around my knees
Was I your favorite person?
Cuz baby, you were mine
And if you'd only let me
I'd squeeze you like a lime

I took your compliments
I just struggled to believe
That I was worth loving
And you weren't lying through your teeth
In truth, I'm a Russian doll
My ego shut inside
I painted them by hand
And I'll never let them die

My cracked skull is a bowl
That holds a coral sea
It's filled with trashy poems
And eastern cherry trees
Despite how much I want to
Just punch you in the face
My favorite smell on this earth
Is still your pillow case
