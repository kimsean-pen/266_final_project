Ooh, I see you over there
Don't be shy come here, um

You got that thing that I can't deny
So move it over here, oh yeah
You're giving signs that I recognize
Say what you want, oh yeah

Baby, there's something about you
Show me, that nothing can hold you down
'Cause I, I must confess
I'm feeling you right now

So, baby, take your chance and show your confidence
Oh, baby, tell me who you are
You make my body scream, you make me believe
That you're what I'm waiting for
(Don't you be intimidated)

Just be a man
Show me where you stand
Positivity, oh yeah, I don't come off shy if you want me back
And if my E G O's oh, no, don't give up to fast

Baby, there's something about you
Show me, that nothing can hold you down
'Cause I, I must confess
I'm feeling you right now

So, baby, take your chance and show your confidence
Oh, baby, tell me who you are
You make my body scream, you make me believe
That you're what I'm waiting for
(Don't you be intimidated)

So much we can be, ooh yes, it's true
First you gotta make the move
For me to see what I want with you

So, baby, take your chance and show your confidence
Oh, baby, tell me who you are
You make my body scream, you make me believe
That you're what I'm waiting for
(Don't you be intimidated)

Oh, baby, tell me who you are
