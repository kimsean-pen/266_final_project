Baby, there's no turning back Tonight it's me and you
Talent it's what God gave to me
And that's what I will use
I live with a rhythm every precision
I can't help it
Can't put it in a bottle
No one else can sell it
It's getting kind of crazy
There'll be no mistake
Cause what I got is nothing
That can ever fade
I'm a dancing machine
Watch me move when I please
My body is gonna be
What you never seen
I'm a dancing machine
I do it just like a freak
Put it in is more what you expect from me
I'm a dancing (a dancing) a dancing machine
I'm a dancing (da da da dancing) a dancing machine
Let the music turn me on
So we can go all night
Once I start I just can't stop
Cause music is me life
I live with a rhythm every precision
I can't help it
Can't put it in a bottle
No one else can sell it It's getting kind of crazy
There'll be no mistake
Cause what I got is nothing
That can ever fade
I'm a dancing machine
Watch me move when I please
My body is gonna be
What you never seen
I'm a dancing machine
I do it just like a freak
Put it in is more what you expect from me
I'm a dancing (a dancing) a dancing machine
I'm a dancing (da da da dancing) a dancing machine
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8
Touch that, touch that, hip, hip, turn it around
Watch me do it
Everything I do, I do it for you
Watch me lose it
Into the music and into the group
I live with a rhythm every precision
I can't help it
Can't put it in a bottle
No one else can sell it It's getting kind of crazy
There'll be no mistake
Cause what I got is nothing
That can ever fade
I'm a dancing machine
Watch me move when I please
My body is gonna be
What you never seen
I'm a dancing machine
I do it just like a freak
Put it in is more what you expect from me
I'm a dancing (a dancing) a dancing machine
I'm a dancing (da da da dancing) a dancing machine
