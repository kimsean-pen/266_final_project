Pre-Chorus]
Nobody there when I need 'em the most
Say that she love me but I know that she don't
I could see it in your face that you think it's a joke
But not funny to me

Tell me that it's alright
Like you used to
In the nighttime
When the lights off
And the darkness creepin' in
I need to wake up from this dream I'm in
I want to lay down right next to you
And talk about the things that we used to do
My new girl she been holdin' me down
But it's nothin' like you used to do

I can never let a man define me
I do everything I can but they still won't try me
I would never let 'em stand behind me
Cause I'm watchin' my back
I don't trust 'em just to keep it a stack
I'll tell you somethin' I can put on my name
I could make it but I never could change
You need somethin' baby I could arrange it
You say you want the man I became it

Tell me that it's alright
Like you used to
In the nighttime
When the lights off
And the darkness creepin' in
I need to wake up from this dream I'm in
I want to lay down right next to you
And talk about the things that we used to do
My new girl she been holdin' me down
But it's nothin' like you used to do

Why we end up right here again?
How we end up back here again?
You try to hate me but I'm back again
You can stab me in the back, I'ma win in the end
I been goin so hard, all the time I spend
Try to do my part, try to help my friend
Friends turn backs when the shit get real
It all feels so real to me
It all feels so real to me

Feels so real
Feels so real
So real
