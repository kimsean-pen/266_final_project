Yeah, I got the juice (oh yeah)
They want take the juice (oh yeah)

Look, it's a sad day
They're behind like a last name
They ain't got the bottle no champagne
Swerve on a hater, fast lane
Get smoked, no ashtray
Back at it again, back ache
It's going down, sad face
Them gyal are bitter, bad taste
With your bad breath
Don't take shots like a cam lens
Old school, way back when
Killed everything, past tense
So just move for me
A couple gyal are trying to take the juice from me
'Cause I got the juice I got the juice, yeah
You're only ever gonna see a deuce from me

I'm like hold up wait why you hating?
I can smell the hater by the fragrance
They don't wanna see me elevating
All wanna talk but wait

'Cause I got the juice
The juice
Yeah, I got the juice
The juice, oh yeah, oh lord
The juice (yeah)
They want take the juice (yeah)
They can't have the juice (yeah)
'Cause me have the juice (yeah)

Yeah, I got it, yeah, I got it
I'ma do it big like your pregnant forehead
iPhone 6 head going on extra horrid
What you telling me? What you telling me?
Juice everywhere so you're smelling me
You went funny Bill Bellamy
Never take an L but there's always an L in me
Brr, brr, they call me up
Them gyal are sketchy, draw me up
Always stay tripping, tour the bus
I got so much juice baby, pour me up
I'm like hold up wait why you hating?
I can smell a hater by the fragrance
They don't wanna see me elevating
All wanna talk but wait

'Cause I got the juice (woo)
The juice (yeah)
Yeah, I got the juice (I got the juice)
The juice, oh yeah, oh lord
The juice (I got the juice)
