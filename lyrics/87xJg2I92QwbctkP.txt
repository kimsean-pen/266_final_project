i'll sing it in my heart
While I wait for you
I wait For you
I'll sing it in my heart
While I wait for you
I wait For you

I'll sing that melody
That you used to sing
I'll sing that melody
That we used to sing

Where did you go
You haven't even called
Oh, Where can I find
The only one who can
Break my heart, break my heart
Break it and make it hurt
Break my heart, break my heart

i'll sing it in my heart
While I wait for you
I wait For you
I'll sing it in my heart
While I wait for you
I wait For you

I'll sing that melody
That we used to sing
I'll sing that melody
That you used to sing

What is the point
Of living with that you
Oh, in my life
These days just feel like nights

Break my heart, break my heart
Break it and make it hurt
Break my heart, break my heart

i'll sing it in my heart
While I wait for you
I wait for you
I'll sing it in my heart
While I wait for you
I wait For you

I'll sing that melody
That we used to sing
I'll sing that melody
That you used to sing

I'll be waiting here
I'll be waiting here
For you
