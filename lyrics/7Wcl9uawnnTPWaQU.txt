I and her face
Brighter than chariots
Or foot-soldiers
Toward and under the bridges
Her chariots
Shouting lydians and
Ranks of foot-soldiers
I possible misstep
Unexpected licking struck her as rather bold
Her step motion on
Her step motion on

Fast fast fast charIots and
Wounded Footsoldiers
Rush in but not
To be too toward
And to shuffle the light
To offend her chariots
Lyrdians sadly outstretched
Firm ranks in place
Designed as a possible way into
Unexpected fantasies
We'd rather watch her step
We'd rather watch her
Step toward motion on
Chariots off
Off solid ground
Stop! slowly on
Stop! slowly on
