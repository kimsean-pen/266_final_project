The blot in my eyes...
Circular
The blot in my eyes...
Circulate

All my pockets are full and my mind is lost
Circulate
The rearview keeps shifting as I stare at the sun

The blot in my eyes...
Circular
The blot in my eyes...
Circulate

All together... back and forth as the wind cusps my inner mind
The sun separates me
Exposed... our greatest fear
All is here to see
Piece by piece you strip away

Exploring the escape
Endless lives whispering by... so fast
Circulate

Exploring the escape
Endless lives whispering by... so fast
Circulate

This is the beginning of my life

I hope you enjoy the show... it's for you, ya know?
To watch you from across the room
To hear you through the tangled lines... it completes me
I've been waiting

The blot in my eyes...
Circulate

Computer simulation complete
Eject the suspect...
Mold and shape to create memory

Bring them back I say...
Sights set on the uncommon agenda
Well done

Computer simulation complete
Eject the suspect...
Mold and shape

I won't remember me
I won't remember us
I won't remember he
I won't remember them

Eyes covered by an electrical storm
Voltage increasing, distance engaging... a mumbling timbre
Silent to this awakening
I'm sorry... a fucking tragedy
A mumbling timbre
Smash... ignite... destroy...
The tunnel's twisting this body into glass
A once hollow man... break through to the other side

Exploring the escape
Endless lives whispering by... so fast
Circulate

Exploring the escape
Endless lives whispering by... so fast
Circulate

The blot in my eyes...
Circular
The blot in my eyes...
Circulate
