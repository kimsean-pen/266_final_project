I'm digging with my fingertips
I'm ripping at the ground I stand upon
I'm searching for fragile bones
Evolution
I'm never gonna be refined
Keep trying but I won't assimilate
Sure, we have come far in time
Watch the bow break

And I'm sorry I don't believe
By the evidence that I see

That there's any hope left for me

It's evolution

Just evolution

And I

I do not dare deny

The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind

And why
Do I deserve to die?

I'm dominated by
This animal that's locked up inside

Close up to get a real good view
I'm betting that the species will survive

Hold tight, I'm getting inside you
Evolution

And when we're going to find these bones
They're going to want to keep them in a jar
The number one virus caused by

Procreation

And the planet may go astray
In a million years they'll say

Those motherfuckers were all deranged
It's evolution
Just evolution

And I
I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind

And why

Do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by
This animal that's locked up inside

Take a look around
Nothing much has changed
Take a look around
Nothing much has changed
Take a look around
Take a look around
Take a look around
Nothing much has changed
Take a look around
Take a look around
Nothing much has changed
Take a look around
Take a look around
Nothing much has changed
Take a look around

I, I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind
And why
Do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by
This animal that's locked up inside
Why?
Why do I deserve to die?
