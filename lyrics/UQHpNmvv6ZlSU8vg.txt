I've lost my key
I've gone too far
Was it enough to make you sick?
Maybe I live again, but would I lose again my virginity?
Oh, my virginity

I'm shaped to get in your way
But in the end
We defend our decadence
You never wept like that
Whatever lost I won't forget about you
Oh, forget about you

It's not what I said, it's what you said
It's what you did did that belongs to everyone
It's not what I hate, it's what you hate
Its decadence belongs to everyone

One day I lie next to you and you stroke my impure hair

You touch my heart

I forget about you
Oh, forget about you
You touch my...
You touch my...

I forget about you
Oh, forget about you
You touch my...

My virginity
