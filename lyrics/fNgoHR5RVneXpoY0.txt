Did you see the stars?
Did you see the sun come up?

You can find me in flowers
You can find yourself some peace

Did you see the stars?
Did you see the sun come up?

You can find me in the flowers
You can find yourself some peace

How can I not need you now?
How can I not need you now?

And while we hide down here
No one can take you away from me

You can burn yourself a fire
I can find ourselves a home
Till the endless summer
No sleep, we talking low
While we sing out to the sun
My eyes and your tears will part
No one knows where we are
My heart became your heart
