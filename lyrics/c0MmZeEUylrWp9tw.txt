Tell It To My Heart
Tell it to my heart tonight.
Baby hold me tight
Tell it to my heart tonight.
Baby hold me tight

Get up and moving around
Would you, would you step by my side
I can't go on like that
So what, so what, we'll try again
Sometimes my heart just stops
When I see you ... for you
Boom boom boom. That goes the beat
No way, I can't take the heat

That's the game we're playing goes on and on
I never say: You go my way
My life is full of hurt and pain
But this time I'll do it fine
I'm standing here beside you near
Please hold me tight for just one night
Baby look at me, I'm for ...
Baby can't you see, believe in me

I can't forget this lovely feeling
I can't forget your love
I can't forget what we've been dreaming
I can't forget your love, your love

What ever is the game to play.
You listen, it's the only way. Forever we'll be together.
Pump up, pump up, now or never
Move it, you have to proove it
Your love is strong enough
Like thousands of another affairs
Baby, you ...
That's the game we're playing goes on and on...
