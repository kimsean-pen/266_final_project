You're a good soldier
Choosing your battles
Pick yourself up and dust yourself off
And back in the saddle

You're on the front line
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious, we are getting closer
This isn't over

The pressure's on, you feel it
But you got it all, believe it

When you fall, get up, oh oh
And if you fall, get up, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
'Cause this is Africa

Tsamina mina, eh eh
Waka waka, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

Listen to your God, this is our motto
Your time to shine, don't wait in line
Y vamos por todo

People are raising their expectations
Go on and feed them, this is your moment
No hesitations

Today's your day, I feel it
You paved the way, believe it

If you get down, get up, oh oh
When you get down, get up, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

Tsamina mina, eh eh
Waka waka, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
Anawa ah ah

Tsamina mina, eh eh
Waka waka, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa
