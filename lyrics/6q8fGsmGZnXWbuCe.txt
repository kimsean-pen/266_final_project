Don't mistake familiar love for loneliness
The best you take for granted, they might fade away
And then you wait and find your bed is cold and vacant
It's too late to make amends, don't let it in

You could be, you could be alone tonight
And you could see, see it from the other side
You could see, I was wrong and you were right
We'll always be tied to the weather
Take us together

Seasons come and seasons go, you know it's true
The sun that shone and let the way in early days has gone and gone
But should we dwell on what we've lost?
It seems so long since happiness, just don't forget

You could be, you could be alone tonight
And you could see, see it from the other side
You could be, you could be alone tonight
And you could see, see it from the other side

Tied to the weather
Take us together
Take us together
