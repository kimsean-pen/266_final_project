Bloodthirsty cherub choir, from the cornfields you sing to me
All to the farmhouse born, majestic Kansan progeny

Senator, news anchor, Superman, and Dorothy
All of the Sunday dress mothers caress your face and say

It's the last picture show, all the cowboys they get ready
For a drawn out charismatic parody
of what a country thought it used to be

Ciphers of the state saw the summer of mercy
Wichita lineman, in the stadium they're screaming

"It's you, I'm the one who loves you
It's true, I'm the one who loves you
It's you, I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one, I'm the one
Yeah, I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one"

White Castle, Pizza Hut and even Applebee's
Before the Koch brothers, the first airplane factory

Skywards, always looking, what's that bellwether indicating?
All of the Sunday dress mothers caress your face and say

"It's you, I'm the one who loves you
It's true, I'm the one who loves you
It's you, I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one, I'm the one
Yeah, I'm the one
It's true, I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one
Yeah, I'm the one
It's true
It's true
