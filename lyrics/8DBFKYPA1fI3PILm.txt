Withdraw Thy Phallus Baboui, open the Gates of the Dust
For I am Burning in Aataakhu, chains bind me, flames encircle me
And burn my flesh open
For Me the Gates Shall Open, over the Fire of the Spirit
The Breth Drawn by the Gods, arise Apophis Return
That I Might Return, borne by the Flame
Drawn by the Gods Who Clear the Way, that I Might Pass
The Gods Which Sprang from the Drops of Blood, which Dripped From
The Phallus of Set, that I might be Reborn
For I am Khetti Satha Shemsu, Seneh Nekai
And Will Become Set of a Million Years, Akhu Amenti Hekau
I shed My Burnt Skin and am Renewed
