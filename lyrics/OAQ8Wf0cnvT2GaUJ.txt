Who said that? Who the fuck said that?
Who's the slimy little communist shit twinkle-toed cocksucker down here
Who just signed his own death warrant?
Nobody, huh?!
The fairy fucking godmother said it!
Out-fucking-standing!
I will P.T. you all until you fucking die!
Uh
This a $crim beat
Uh, digging for all the facts, uh
Ruby da Cherry, yeah
DJ $crim with that 808

You can catch me chillin' with the polar bears
Bogus, fucking jokes on us sucka punch
Dat D.A.R.E sweatshirt wearing mothafucka $crim
Scarier Ric Flair, been there done jack
Sack full of cash
Backpack of hash
Grab that stash and dash
There ain't never a clash
Rip a flash
Swallow ya soul through a flask
Grab that mask and never look back
Black plague sick
Oh wait I meant to say slick
Pissin' on his missin' Mrs
(yeah, uh)
Dippin' the tip in the grip
And sipin' glory, tippin' maury
It's a fuckin' secret story
Kinda boring, yeah
(Uh) stormin' in the southeast
Shit it's really pourin'
But I'm snorin'
Hit the alarm clock
While my stocks in farm blocks
Gets hot, like a pot
On the fuckin' stove oven top

Hell, I like you.
You can come over to my house and fuck my sister.
You little scumbag!
I've got your name! I've got your ass!

$lick $loth
Work!
Ridin' solo, through Kyoto
With four hoes, I'm a no-show
For more shows, wanna tango
Drinkin' Faygo, maybe mango
Got a tan ho, couple tan bros
Make a fan go, to the van ho
Fuck her mouth till the tears start pourin' out
I'm just chillin' eating pizza in a foreign house
Quiet as a mouse, plottin' on a spouse
Whats this all about? I don't even know
Only thing I know is that I'm throwed
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sippin' and spillin'
Villians is chillin'
Eatin' on children
It's Scrimmy the villain
Got penicillin
Munchin on Chili's
Pop a few wheelies
Pop a few pillies
Bite a few titties
With my homeboy Timmy
Grippin' on semis
(Rrah, rrah, rrah, rrah)

Exactly three fucking seconds--to wipe that stupid-looking grin off your face, or I will gouge out your eyeballs and skull-fuck you!
One! Two! Three!"
Sir, I can't help it, sir!
Bullshit! Get on your knees, scumbag!

This is my rifle! this is my gun!
This is for fighting! This is for fun!
