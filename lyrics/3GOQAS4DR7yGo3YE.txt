Please, could you stay
Awhile to share my grief?
For it's such a lovely day
To have to always feel this way

And the time
That I will suffer less
Is when
I never have to wake

Wandering stars
For whom it is reserved
The blackness
Of darkness, forever!

Wandering stars
For whom it is reserved
The blackness
Of darkness, forever!

Those who have seen the needles I now tread
Like a husk
From which all that was now has fled

And the masks
That the monsters wear
To feed
Upon their... prey!

Wandering stars
For whom it is reserved
The blackness
Of darkness, forever!

Wandering stars
For whom it is reserved
The blackness
Of darkness, forever!

Doubled up inside
Take awhile... to share my grief
Always doubled up inside
Taunted!
Cruel!

Wandering stars
For whom it is reserved
The blackness
Of darkness, forever!

Wandering stars
For whom it is reserved
The blackness
Of darkness, forever!
