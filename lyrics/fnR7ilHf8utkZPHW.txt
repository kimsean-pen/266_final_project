I won't forget when I couldn't go to bed with the lights off
When I heard that voice call me in for the night
I remember when love was just a word and not a fight
All I had to worry about were broken bones and being left alone

Way back then there were monsters in my closet
And now there's just skeletons hiding in there
The clock is ticking away
The leaves are still falling every day
The sunburn on my shoulders kept warm back then
Like the heat from the blacktop again and again
I remember when smoke didn't fill my lungs
When my hands were lost and so young

It seemed like the houses were touching the sky
And I thought this smile on my face would never lie

Oh, the summer we were staring at the sun
The summer we were staring at the
Oh, the summer we were staring at the sun

Way back then there were monsters in my closet
And now there's just skeletons hiding in there
The clock is ticking away
The leaves are still falling every day
The sunburn on my shoulders kept warm back then
Like the heat from the blacktop again and again
