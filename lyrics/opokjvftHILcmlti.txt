This is the Heartbreak Hotel
This is the Heartbreak Hotel
This is the Heartbreak Hotel
This is the Heartbreak Hotel

You said you'd be here by nine
Instead you took your time
You didn't think to call me boy
Here I sit trying not to cry
Asking myself why you do this to me, oh baby
Since you're not around for me
To tell you, baby face to face
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? Look what you did to me
(What'd you do? Oh baby)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
(Do me right)
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
(Made me cry)
What'd you do to me, can't take what you did to me

Now I see what you've been doin' wrong, blamed me all along
And made a fool of me baby, you got it all wrong
To think that I wouldn't find out that you were
Cheating on me, dear, how could you do it to me?
Since you're not around for me
To tell you, baby face to face
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say
(Oh, oh)
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? Look what you did to me
(All you did was lie to me, baby yeah)
(Can't believe what you did to me, yeah, yeah)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me? Can't take what you did to me
(Why'd you do it?)
(You didn't have to do it to me, baby)

This is the Heartbreak Hotel
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel
(Oh)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel
(Ooh, my)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel
(This is the Heartbreak)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel
(Welcome to the Heartbreak)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel
(Why'd you do it?)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me?
Look what you did to me
(Ooh, ooh, I really want it now)
I thought that you were someone
Who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions
And you made me cry
(Can't take it no more)
What'd you do to me? Can't take what you did to me
(I wanted your love)
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
(All I really want)
When someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me?
(But you told me lies, can't take it no more)
Look what you did to me
(Why did you do me that way?)
I thought that you were someone
Who would do me right
(Thought you'd do me right)
Until you played with my emotions
And you made me cry
(Till you made me cry)
What'd you do to me? Can't take what you did to me
(Oh, whoa whoa)

I ain't gon' take it, I ain't gon' take it no more
I ain't gon' take it boy, I ain't gon' take it no more
Oh, everything that you said was a lie to me
Don't let to me, tell me what it is and I will be alright
Don't you tell me lies
