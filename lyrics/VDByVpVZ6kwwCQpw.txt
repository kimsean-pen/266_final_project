If we start to sound like a broken record
Will you be a song that I love
Would you stay and listen with me forever
I hope that I'll be enough

Hit the gas and let go of the wheel
I'm just scared because now it's real
The daily wars and the whiskey shots
I need this feeling at all costs

I watched you digging your grave
If you bury yourself
You'll be burying me too
And I feel you fading away
Still you draw me to you
Like the tide to the full moon

If we start to sound like a broken record
Will you be a song that I love
Would you stay and listen with me forever
I hope that I'll be enough
Mark my words
That I won't let it be this way
Hear me out
When you're fading
And I'm falling apart
If we start to sound like a broken record
Will you be a song that I love

I don't care
That all is lost
Tonight we dance on burial plots
Bite your fucking tongue
My heart is in my hands still bleeding
Who knew that something so deep
Could be fleeting
A new day
A new disappointment
Did you stop to think
That maybe it's all pointless

I watched you digging your grave
If you bury yourself
You'll be burying me too
And I feel you fading away
Still you draw me to you
Like the tide to the full moon

If we start to sound like a broken record
Will you be a song that I love
Would you stay and listen with me forever
I hope that I'll be enough
Mark my words
That I won't let it be this way
Hear me out
When you're fading
And I'm falling apart
If we start to sound like a broken record
Will you be a song that I love

This record is skipping
I feel like we're slipping away
No matter what I do
I can't seem to let go
This record is skipping
I feel like we're slipping away
Get out of my head

If we start to sound like a broken record
If we start to sound like a broken record

If we start to sound like a broken record
Will you be a song that I love
Would you stay and listen with me forever
I hope that I'll be enough
Mark my words
That I won't let it be this way
Hear me out
When you're fading
And I'm falling apart
If we start to sound like a broken record
Will you be a song that I love
