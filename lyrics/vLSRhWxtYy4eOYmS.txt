This doesn't make much sense
Think far out but I'm still locked in...
I'm still lost walking circles
The floor swallowed me up whole
There's nowhere to go...

There's a vulture on my shoulder, and he's telling me to give in
Always hissing, right in my ear, like it's coming from my own head
It's got me mixed up, trying not to give up
Tell me there's a way to get out of here
Oh, fixed at zero

I've learned to talk with my fingers
The only voice that wakes my ears...
(Oh, make my bones do something...)
Ever wanna jump out your skin?
Anticipate until the sidewalk ends
There's nowhere to go...

There's a vulture on my shoulder, and he's telling me to give in
Always hissing, right in my ear, like it's coming from my own head
It's got me mixed up, trying not to give up
Tell me there's a way to get out of here
Oh, fixed at zero

There's a vulture on my shoulder, and he's telling me to give in
Always hissing, right in my ear, like it's coming from my own head
It's got me mixed up, trying not to give up
Tell me there's a way to get out of here
Woah, fixed at zero

Fixed at zero

I'm fixed at zero
