Did you ever notice
Did you ever notice

What you do it takes a toll on me
What you do it takes a toll on me

Did you ever notice
Did you ever notice

What you do it takes a toll on me
What you do it takes a toll on me

Oh oh oh oh

Did you ever notice
Did you ever notice

(Song change, 'Could've Been, Should've Been')

Could've been, should've been so much more
Could've been, should've been so much more
And you try, and try, and try, and try but you could've been, should've been
When you try, and try, and try, and try but you could've been, should've been, more

It's such a tiring ride
Oh with the weight of expectations always taking up your time
To fight the meaningless tide
It's been dragging all the victims down to their own demise

Could've been, should've been so much more
Could've been, should've been so much more
Could've been, should've been so much more
Could've been, should've been so much more

Could've been, should've been so much more
Could've been, should've been so much more
Could've been, should've been so much more
Could've been, should've been so much more
