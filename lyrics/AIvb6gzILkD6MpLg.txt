When all is lost to you inside
When all the darkness takes the light
The ritual it has begun
Now you tear away from everyone

Disconnected, so alone
Severed ties from all you know

Isolation
Brings you to the end
Until you love again
Isolation
If you could only see
What will come to be

Justified you waste away
You'd dare to dream, but still you're too afraid
Now you're broken and deceived
Lost to live this cruel reality

You're disconnected, so alone
Severed ties from all you know

Isolation
Brings you to the end
Until you love again
Isolation
If you could only see
What will come to be

Maybe you'll stand
Maybe you'll give
And break to find another way
And make things better
Maybe you'll find a life you can live
And learn to love along the way
And make things better
And make things better

Isolation
Brings you to the end
Until you love again
Isolation
If you could only see
What will come to be
Isolation
Brings you to the end
Until you love again
Isolation
If you could only see
What will come to be

You're disconnected, so alone
What will come to be
You're disconnected, so alone
