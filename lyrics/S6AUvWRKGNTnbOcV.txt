People has stirred moved by the word
Kneel at the shrine, deceived by the wine
How was the earth conceived?
Infinite space
Is there such a place?
You must believe in the human race

Can you believe God makes you breathe?
Why did He lose six million Jews?

Touched by the wings
Fears angel brings
Sad winter storm
Grey autumn dawn
Who looks on life itself?
Who lights your way?
Only you can say
How can you just obey?

Don't need the word
Now that you've heard
Don't be afraid
Man is man made
And when the hour comes
Don't turn away
Face the light of day
And do it your away
It's the only way
