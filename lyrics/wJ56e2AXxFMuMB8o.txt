Northwest apartment, apartment
I'm driving over in Moclips baby with the whole neighborhood in tow
Somebody trapped in the underground basement just a few blocks down the road
Northwest apartment, apartment

With three guitars and one amplifier I'm gonna blow the dust off this scene
And everybody in population on it gonna find out what I mean
Northwest apartment, apartment
When all the parts equal more than the sum
And the sum equals none

This thing was built in a day but knowing that the Romans took longer than that
We brought a bass player a cold old soul and he's a first class welcome mat
Well cleaned apartment! Apartment

In the morning I wake up I'm ready for the night time to begin
And what's that over there on my pillow someone sleeping in my bed
Northwest apartment, apartment
When all the parts equal more than the sum
And the sum equals none
Yeah, well
