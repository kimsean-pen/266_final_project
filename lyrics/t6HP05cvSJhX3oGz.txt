A forgotten world
A forgotten time
Within these walls
We think we live

Numb to our surroundings
Dead to the outside world
Slaves of our own device

We all strive for simplicity
Yet complicating every moment

Our deepest instincts being lost
Submit to the bigger picture
They call it life
We know its lies
Consumed by an endless cycle

We hold onto moments
Tightening our grip
Living in the future
Forgetting the present

We all strive for simplicity
Yet complicating every moment

Our deepest instincts being lost
Submit to the bigger picture
They call it life
We know its lies
Consumed by an endless cycle

We hold onto moments
Tightening our grip
Living in the future
Forgetting the present
