Vital, vital, vital
Vital, vital, vital
Died by the stairs
He's the man who, ...together in space
Searching my soul...
breaking it all forever in me
by the boat, by the boat ...this far away
follow this ... lead, I pray
Vital, vital, vital
Vital, vital, vital

He's the man who, ...together in space
Searching my soul...
breaking it all forever in me
by the boat, by the boat ...this far away
follow this ... lead, I pray.
