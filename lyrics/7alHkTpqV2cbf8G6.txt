Betrayal

Insecurities

Dividends

It's not your fault
The well of thought and trust has run dry
Don't be afraid to let go
Don't be afraid to start over when it's over

Let go
Let go
Let go
Let go

Let go of feelings
Let go of compromise
Hollow trunk for shelter
So dark and cold inside
I always seem to find myself alone
Jaded shell of being
Porous as a stone

Calloused
Rigid
Empty
Because of you

Let go of trusting
Lost thought for family
Let go of living
No more concerns of demise
I never seem to find rhythm for life's harmony

Contorted
Twisted broken
Without a reason

Calloused
Rigid
Empty
Because of you

It's all me
All you are
Without me
There's nothing else
There's no one

Brainwash
All you are
Without me
You're by yourself
There's no one

Hope is out of season
Lost sight
No hint of light
Get busy living or get busy dying

Calloused
Rigid
Empty
Because of you

It's all me
All you are
Without me
There's nothing else
There's no one

Brainwash
All you are
Without me
You're by yourself
There's no one

Save me
This loss
Closure my
Answer
So grant it

You owe me all that you are
Without me
You're nothing
You're no one

Terrified
Petrified

Nothing
You're no one
Do you care because I don't
Nothing
You're no one
Nobody cares so just go

Nothing
You're no one
By yourself all alone

It's all me
All you are
Without me
There's nothing else
There's no one

Brainwash
All you are
Without me
You're by yourself
There's no one

Save me
This loss
Closure my
Answer
So grant it
You owe me all that you are
Without me
You're nothing
