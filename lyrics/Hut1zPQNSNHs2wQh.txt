What's a miracle
If life itself is not?
Who am I to praise its worth
With a hymn
I may stumble
Over words that I forgot,
Just as life itself
May slowly begin.

Sing me a song for the mountains to move,
Sing me the anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem of life.

I am skeptical
I like my glass of wine,
I don't know your name
Or what I am to do.
One day you'll wonder why
Try read between the lines,
And you will sing for me
The way I sang for you.

Sing me a song for the ocean to part,
Sing me the anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem of life.

So another page is turned,
I pray I understand what's happening,
But if anything
I do know this,
I'll be the best I can.

Sing me a song like the angels rejoice,
Sing me an anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem,
Sing me the anthem of life.
