Christ, or credit?
What's the prize?
What's the edit?
I'm alive
I don't credit
A source
I just drive
And then the fog rolls in
And then they're bright.
My enemies
They're just trying.
Trying to kill me

()
Breaking the waves
I can't ignore (I tried)
The ocean is strong
I cannot stem the tide
Breaking the waves
I can't ignore (I tried)
I can't seem to stem
The tide no more (?)
I tried
I tried

Drive me to?
I've got the time
And it's been too long
Since I've been
Driving all night
On the back road's winding
Under the stars
That are slowly dying
(oh no)

Breaking the waves
I can't ignore (I tried)
The ocean is strong
I cannot stem the tide
Breaking the waves
I can't ignore (I tried)
I can't seem to stem
The tide no more (?)
I tried
I tried

(musical bridge)

Jack-knifed
On the side-street crossing
I'm still alive
(and that's something)
And when I die
There will be nothing... to say
Except I tried
Not to waste another day
Trying to stem the tide
