You're so far out there I can barely see
You hover on the edge of everything
I try not to follow, I try not to speak
I walk in circles, staring at my feet

I know
I shouldn't try to keep track
You're so close
I can't find my way back

You're imagining this
It's a dream you'll forget
And I keep telling myself, wake up it's over

You float on the horizon out of reach
You want me to wait back here on the beach
I'll give you all the distance that you need
You want to stay together and be free

I know
I shouldn't try to keep track
You're so close
I can't find my way back

You're imagining this
It's a dream you'll forget
And I keep telling myself, wake up it's over

You're imaging this
It's a dream you'll forget
I keep telling myself, wake up it's over

Wake up it's over
Wake up it's over

If everything I see, everything, everything's a dream
Wake up, wake up
If everything I feel is just the feeling of a dream
Wake up, wake up, wake up

You're imagining this
It's a dream you'll forget
I keep telling myself, wake up it's over

You're imagining this
It's a dream you'll forget
I keep telling myself, wake up it's over

Wake up it's over
Wake up it's over
Wake up it's over
Wake up it's over
