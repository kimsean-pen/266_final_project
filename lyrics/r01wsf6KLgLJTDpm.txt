Day has gone
But I'm still here with you
My sweet rose
My green hills, beloved sea, lakes and sky
Beloved mother earth

Silent land
Erase my thoughts
I wanna lose myself in you,
All in you
Caress me and my soul
while I close my eyes

Oh wings of destiny
Through virgin skies
To far horizons I will fly

Dear peaceful land
Dear mother earth
Caress my soul while I close my eyes

Oh wings of destiny
Through virgin skies
To far horizons I will fly

Oh wings of destiny
Through virgin skies
To far horizons I will fly
