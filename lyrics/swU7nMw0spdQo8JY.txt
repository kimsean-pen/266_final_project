To make you want me I can fabricate the truth
I'll give you easy it'll keep me destitute
You hang me up on the line, hang me out to dry
And you got nothing to lose

You've got the story all made up inside your head
You write me out of it and use your words instead
You hold me just out of reach, but you keep me pounding the beat
To take all the soul you can get

You want me to change, change, change
You want me to change
You want me to change, change, change
You want me to change

You take no chances and you give no other choice
You fill your pockets and you empty out my voice
You use the shallow and old, trade the heart for the gold
You sell the song for the noise

You want me to change, change, change
You want me to change
You want me to change, change, change
You want me to change

You want me to change, change, change
You want me to change
You want me to change, change, change
You want me to change

You want me to change, change, change
You want me to change
You want me to change, change, change
You want me to change

You want me to change, change, change
You want me to change
You want me to change, change, change
You want me to change

You want me to change, change, change
You want me to change
You want me to change, change, change
You want me to change
