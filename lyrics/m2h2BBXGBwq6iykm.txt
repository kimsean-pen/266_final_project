You treat me like Obama
I barely know you, you want me to meet your mama
And I know that you've been praying for Nirvana
That Prosecco don't got you feelin' like Rihanna

Singin' stay, so I'll wait
As we start it again, actin' out this cliche
So you bend 'till you'll break
Talkin' shit 'bout me to your friends

Your love is louder than mine
And I'm no good for ya
But I'm still good to ya
And you tuck me into the dead
When I'm no good for ya
'Cause I give it to ya

When I look for cover, we crash into each other
Then you pull me under, it's so good
You keep me comin' through the summer
That Prosecco don't got you feelin' like Rihanna

Singin' stay, so I'll wait
As we start it again, actin' out this cliche
So you bend 'till you'll break
'Cause it's easy to pretend

Your love is louder than mine
And I'm no good for ya (no good for ya)
But I'm still good to ya (still good to ya)
And you tuck me into the night
When I'm no good for ya (no good for ya)
'Cause I give it to ya (give it to ya)

You know I'm no good for ya (no good for ya)
You know I'm no good for ya (give it to ya)

I'm not the one you're lookin' for
Making love won't help you stop the war
So say goodbye, I'll always love you
The summer's that we shared is always blessed

You treat me like Obama (yeah, yeah)
You want me to meet your mama
And I know that you've been praying for Nirvana
That Prosecco don't got you feeling like Rihanna

Your love is louder than mine
And I'm no good for ya (no good for ya)
But I'm still good to ya (still good to ya)
And you tuck me into the night
When I'm no good for ya (no good for ya)
'Cause I give it to ya (give it to ya)

Wherever I go, wherever I go, she needs Goodie
You know I'm no good for ya
Wherever I go, wherever I go, she needs Goodie
You know I'm no good for ya
Wherever I go, wherever I go, she needs Goodie
You know I'm no good for ya
Wherever I go, wherever I go, she needs Goodie
You know I'm no good for ya

Yeah, yeah
That's great, that's really, to me my brain is...
