Luxurious lovin' like Egyptian cotton
If I ain't got nothin', least I got you
I wait with the top down, a milli in the bank account
It ain't what I got, but, it's what you do

Deeper than oceans, as sweet as devotion, it's all I need
You pull me close and there's no way that I can describe

What your love make me feel like, oh
Your love make me feel like, oh
Your love make me feel like, oh
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
That's what your love make me feel like, oh
Your love make me feel like, oh
Your love make me feel like, oh
Come and kiss me like the first time
That's what your love make me feel like

Late up on Sunday, ain't workin' on Monday
Let's pack up and run away, just me and you
Come closer 'cause I want it all over my body
Boy, there ain't no heartache you can't undo

Deeper than oceans, as sweet as devotion, it's all I need
You pull me close and there's no way that I can describe

What your love make me feel like, oh
Your love make me feel like, oh
Your love make me feel like, oh
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
That's what your love make me feel like, oh
Your love make me feel like, oh
Your love make me feel like, oh
Come and kiss me like the first time
That's what your love make me feel like

Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
That's what your love make me feel like
(Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love)

Like, woah, if you know you're in love
And it feel like the one
Them put 'em up, put 'em up in the sky
Let me sing again
Like, woah, you're the one that I need
Take my hand baby, please
Them put 'em up, put 'em up in the sky
Let me sing again

Your love make me feel like
Your love make me feel like
Your love make me feel like

Your love make me feel like
Your love make me feel like
Your love make me feel like
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
That's what your love make me feel like, oh
Your love make me feel like, oh
Your love make me feel like, oh
Come and kiss me like the first time
That's what your love make me feel like

Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
