No!

I'm goin' down to Alphabet Street
I'm gonna crown the first girl that I meet
I'm gonna talk so sexy
She'll want me from my head to my feet

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes she will
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm gonna drive my daddy's Thunderbird (My daddy's Thunderbird)
A white rad ride, '66 ('67) so glam it's absurd
I'm gonna put her in the back seat
And drive her to Tennessee

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Tennessee
Yeah, yeah, yeah, drive her

Excuse me baby
I don't mean to be rude
But I guess tonight I'm just not, I'm just not in the mood
So if you don't mind (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I would like to watch

Yeah, yeah, yeah, can I?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Can I, can I, can I, can I)

We're going down, down, down, if that's the only way
To make this cruel, cruel world hear what we got to say
Put the right letters together and make a better day

Yeah, yeah, yeah, better days
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's ok
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe it's the only way

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
