On the lips of my love, I'm alone again
On the lips of my love, I'm alone again

On the lips of my love, I'm alone again
But dreaming with a kiss
I could lose, I could fail, I could fold and then
Come right back to this
You've got your arms wide
And sin in your eyes

I'm a thief, I'm a coward, I'm a fool, it hurts
Thinking this was real
When I lose, when I fall, clutching out of her
Everything I feel
You've got my hands tied
Innocent sacrifice

I feel I'm goin' under
'Cause my heart is bleeding colors
Only for you
Only for you

And I feel I'm goin' under
'Cause my heart is bleeding colors
Only for you
Only for you

On the lips of my love, I'm alone again
But dreaming with a kiss
I could lose, I could fall, I could fold and then
Come right back to this
You've got your arms wide
And sin in your eyes

On the lips of my love, I'm alone again
Bleed so, I can taste where your love has been
Put your heart on my teeth, I can break the skin
Pull me close, you can feel where my live begins
You've got your long times
It's in you blood line

And I feel I'm sinking deeper
'Cause you're clutching both my feet, dear
And my eyes are where this
wouldn't faint my lungs

And I feel I'm goin' under
'Cause my heart is bleeding colors
Only for you
Only for you

And I feel I'm goin' under
'Cause your smile like you're my savior
While your hands keep getting
Tighter around my throat
