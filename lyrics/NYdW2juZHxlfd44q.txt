Hate-filled mind
Wounds left unhealed through time
Hate-filled life
Scars left from words through time

Thrown, far, high
Lost arrows, one forgets
Heart gone blind
Drowned oneself in regrets

Strained...
The string of pain
Bowed in causality
Sadness remains

Peace...
Won't be obtained
As veils of ignorance,
Hatred retains

Storm of arrows through karma
Seeking light through samsara
