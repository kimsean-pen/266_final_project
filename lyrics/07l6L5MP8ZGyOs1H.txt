I am so ashamed,
I am so ashamed of all the trouble I have caused
I am so ashamed of all these un-opened doors
I am so ashamed of what I have become.

Oh, my heart is bursting again
Don't leave this mark
Your eyes are turning away

I am of the west,
I am fair skinned I deserve a bullet in my chest
If I have no religion I've no reason to be scared
I am going to hell but I just don't care.
