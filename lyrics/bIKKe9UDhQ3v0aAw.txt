I need someone
To treat me right
I need someone
To hold me tight

Gotta love
Gotta love
Gotta love
Gotta love

I want some, need some
Got to have some
Take some, make some
Got to get it
Gotta get it
Good loving

Oh oh somebody
Looking for somebody

'Cause what seems real to me
Was just a fantasy
My infatuation
Is the current situation
