I wake to bleed another day
Dragging my anvil of pain
Betrayed, abandoned, rejected by life
My torment has branded its stain

At ease to leave this forsaken earth
My soul is awaiting my cry
Directing my lifeline away from its path
Soon is the moment I die

No way of sharing the pain that I feel
Disguising my plans to betray
Fire awaiting, my soul will be free
Tonight I'm passing away

How to live and how to bow
The lesson one must learn
Distinguish myself from your misery
Let's see now who will burn

All those who speak without a face
Now you'll remember my song
Before I was air, but not anymore
I might be pale, but I've never felt as strong
