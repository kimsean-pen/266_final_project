The wording of the deal, I forget
The spinning of the wheel, again

So take aim
Take aim
Take aim on me

The turning of the wheel, begins
The crown that is deserving, behead

So take aim
Take aim
Take aim on me

Take aim
Take aim
Take aim on me
All over again

All over again
All over again
All over again

Say it
Higher
You must feel high as the birds
(Since day one, day one)
And I don't think I ever got your name?
