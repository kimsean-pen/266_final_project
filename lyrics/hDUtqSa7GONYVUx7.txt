All you got to do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you got to do is not answer my calls when
I'm trying to get through
To keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
(You give me) 'Cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I

All I got to say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby, you give me butterflies

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
'Cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
(You give me) 'Cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I

If you would take my hand, baby, I would show you
Guide you to the light, babe
If you would be my love, baby, I will love you
Love you 'til the end of time

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
(Girl you give me) 'Cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
'Cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
