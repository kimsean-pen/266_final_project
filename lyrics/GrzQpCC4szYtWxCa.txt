It's hard to speak
Mumbling my poetry
But talk is cheap
And your body is saying other things
No need to fear
Cause the crew is here
If tonight you're free
Well come and get a groove with me

Glowing like no other
Can I get another
Must be nice to look like that

Who gave you my number
They deserve a pay bump
Who taught you to move like that

Say that you want me just to want somebody
Tell me you need me cause I need somebody
None of these lines will ever make you love me
Hurts good to want ya take the pain I get from you

A killer queen
Never really as she seems
A super freak
She's stallin with her magazines
Well I'm right here
And I volunteer
If tonight you're free
Well come and get a groove with me

Hey I know you're trouble
Pouring me a double
Damn it's nice to feel like that

You're my biggest wonder
I think I could love ya
Must be nice to live like that

Say that you want me just to want somebody
Tell me you need me cause I need somebody
None of these lines will ever make you love me
Hurts good to want ya take the pain I get from you

Ooh baby

My head aches
My heart aches
I'm awake
I'm alive

My head aches
My heart aches
I'm awake
I'm alive

Say that you want me just to want somebody
Tell me you need me cause I need somebody
None of these lines will ever make you love me
Hurts good to want ya take the pain I get from you

Hurts good to want ya take the pain I get from you
