I am I
You are you
We are we
We could live in such harmony

Can't you see
Apathy
Lies between
We could live in such harmony

And I'm praying for the day
When you and I and he and she are we
Humanity will sing harmony

We start a war
But what's it for?
We fight for peace

Peace will find us with harmony
So trade your guns
And fire with doves
We fight for love

And peace will find us with harmony
And I'm praying for the day
When you and I and he and she are we
Humanity will sing harmony

So one for all
And all for one
We for we
We could sing in such harmony
I work for you
You work for me
We work for free
And we can sing in such harmony
And I'm praying for the day
When you and I and he and she are we
Humanity will sing harmony
