I've run out of complicated theories
So now I'm taking back my words
And I'm preparing for the breakdown

Your t-shirt's lost its smell of you
And the bathroom's still a mess
Remind me why we decided this was for the best

Because I miss you love
I miss you love
I miss you love
I miss you love
I know the distance is a factor

But I stretch as often as I can
My goal's to reach your hands any day now
Please don't blame me for trying

To fix this one last time
I have a hard time as it is
Because I miss you love

I miss you love
I miss you love
I miss you love
Don't act like you don't know me

It's still me, I've never changed
I'll be here when you come back
And I miss you love

I miss you love
I miss you love
I miss you love
I miss you love
I miss you love
I miss you love
I miss you love
