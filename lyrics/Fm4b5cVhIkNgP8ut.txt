I'm drowning
In this black stream
Of sunken dreams

Under the water
I'm breathing in
I'm breathing
(The phantoms, the nightmares)

And the firelights
Upon the waters burning
On the isle of time
Where golden torches burning bright
Touch to realize now
All tides of dark are turning
Trust in the night now
Inside the fires burning bright

I'm floating
Upon this black stream
Of broken dreams

Upon the water
I'm bleeding
I'm bleeding
(The phantoms, the nightmares)

And the firelights
Upon the waters burning
On the isle of time
Where golden torches burning bright
Touch to realize now
All tides of dark are turning
Trust in the night now
Inside the fires burning bright

Pull me under
Under these black waves
Fill my lungs with your fire
Their poison ropes cut into my hands

Drown me down to your abyss
Blind my eyes with your blades
I drag you with me into these flames
And all that remains

Are ashes
Of phantoms
Of fears

And the firelights
Upon the waters burning
On the isle of time
Where golden torches burning bright
Touch to realize now
All tides of dark are turning
Trust in the night now
Inside the fires burning bright
