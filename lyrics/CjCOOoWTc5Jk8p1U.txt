Oh my love
What's that sound?
From the shadows when you came around
Shattered love
Was it fun?
'Cause you left me like the setting sun

Pulled it out
Threw it down
Picked my heart up then you danced around
Shattered love
So it goes
I was charmed by a faded rose

Was it fun?
Did you laugh?
Did your love cut me in half?
Shattered love
Did you know
I'm in love with a faded rose?

How'd it feel?
Was it nice?
Do you feel really big inside?
Shattered love
Is what you've done
Faded roses got me on the run
