It's amazing
how you make your face just like a wall
how you take your heart and turn it off
how I turn my head and lose it all

It's unnerving
how just one move puts me by myself
There you go just trustin' someone else
Now I know I put us both through hell

I'm not sayin'
there was nothin' wrong
I just didn't think you'd ever get tired of me
And I'm not sayin'
we ever had the right to hold on
I just couldn't ever let you get away from me

But if that's how it's gonna leave
straight out from underneath
then we'll see who's sorry now
If that's how it's gonna stand, when
you know you've been depending on
the one you're leavin' now
the one you're leavin' out

It's aggravating
how you threw me on
and you tore me out
how your good intentions turned to doubt
the way you needed time to sort it out

I'm not sayin'
there was nothin' wrong
I just didn't think you'd ever get tired of me
And I'm not sayin'
we ever had the right to hold on
I just didn't wanna let it get away from me

But if that's how your gonna leave
straight out from underneath
then we'll see who's sorry now
If that's how it's gonna stand, when
you know you've been depending on
the one you're leavin' now
the one you're leavin' out
the one you're leavin' now
Now now now no
the one you're leavin' out

I'm not sayin'
there was nothin' wrong
I didn't think you'd ever get tired of me

But if that's how your gonna leave
straight out from underneath
then we'll see who's sorry now
If that's how it's gonna stand, when
you know you've been depending on
the one you're leavin' now now
yea well tell me is that how it's gonna end
when you know youve been depending on
the one you're leaving now
the one you're leaving out
i'm the one your leavin' now
the one you're leavin' out
