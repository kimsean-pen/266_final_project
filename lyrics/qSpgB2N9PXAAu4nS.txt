You put my back against the wall
Watching, waiting
You never thought I'd get this far
Beneath your skin
I watched you swim with all your lies
They pulled you under
As you wait for my demise
I'm just getting stronger

I'm learning who you really are
And nothing can save you

I will fight until the end (get ready to collide)
And I will watch you fall again (I'll bury you alive)
You tried to bring me to my knees (you tried to take it all)
Now I will stand and watch you crawl

I'll put you back where you belong
Hopeless, fading
And I will rise while you
Become the monster you have fed

I'll let you drown in your despair
Now nothing can save you

I will fight until the end (get ready to collide)
And I will watch you fall again (I'll bury you alive)
You tried to bring me to my knees (you tried to take it all)
Now I will stand and watch you crawl

I'm still here, I'm still here, I'm still here
Now I'm gonna watch you beg, beg, beg

I will fight until the end (get ready to collide)
And I will watch you fall again (I'll bury you alive)
You tried to bring me to my knees (you tried to take it all)
Now I will stand and watch you crawl
