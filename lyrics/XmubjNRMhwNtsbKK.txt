I buried my heart in a hole in the ground
With the lights, and the roses, and the cowards downtown
They threw me a party, there was no one around
They tried to call my girl, but she could not be found

I buried my guilt in a pit, in the sand
With the rust, and the vultures, and the trash downtown
So don't step to me, kid, you'll never be found
'Cause while you were sleeping, I took over your town

When I see a man, I see a liar
When I see a man, I see a liar
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, won't ya

I fell for a girl with a port white stain
I knew her initials, but never her name
I tried and I tried, and I was never the same
So no longer for love, and I'm forever changed

When I see you mad, I see a lion
When I see you mad, I see a lion
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, won't ya

Give up my money, give up my name, take it away
I'll give it away, I'll give it away, I'll give it
When I see you mad, I see a lion
When I see you mad, I see a lion

When I see you mad, I see a lion
When I see you mad, I see a lion
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, won't ya

Give up my money, give up my name, take it away
I'll give it away, give it away, I'll give it
I'm a sympathetic animal,
I'm a sympathetic animal, I'm a sympathetic animal
Break up the chain, I'll break up the chain, I'll break it
Give it away, I'll give it away, I'll give it

When I see you mad, I see a lion
When I see you mad, I see a lion
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, won't ya

Give up my money, give up my name, take it away
Give it away, give it away, I'll give it
See you again, I'll see you again, I'll see ya

Give it away, I'll give it away, I'll give it
When I feel low, when I feel low, I feel it

When I see you mad, I see a lion
When I see you mad, I see a lion
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, won't ya
