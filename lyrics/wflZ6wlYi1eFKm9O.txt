I'm in like with you
Not in love with you
Quite yet
My heart's beginning to
Slightly overrule
My head

Oh no oh no
My self-control
It won't hold up
For very long
Oh no oh no
You touch my soul
I can't help falling too fast for you

Can you hold on a bit?
Stop before we go
Cause I might need a moment
And I wouldn't wanna spoil it

Who knows
If I am
Ready or not
Only time will tell
Who knows
If we are
Ready to make this something
Who knows

Maybe this is love
But I haven't fallen in quite yet

Oh no oh no
My self-control
It won't hold up
For very long
Oh no oh no
You touch my soul
I can't help falling too fast for you

Can you hold on a bit?
Stop before we go
Cause I might need a moment
And I wouldn't wanna spoil it

Who knows
If I am
Ready or not
Only time will tell
Who knows
If we are
Ready to make this something
Who knows

Can you hold on a bit?
Stop before we go
Cause I might need a moment
And I wouldn't wanna spoil it

Who knows
If I am
Ready or not
Only time will tell
Who knows
If we are
Ready to make this something
Who knows

Who knows
If I am
Ready or not
Only time will tell
Who knows
If we are
Ready to make this something
Who knows

Who knows
Maybe
Maybe not
Who knows
Maybe
Maybe not
Who knows
Oh oh yeah
Maybe I will
Maybe I won't
Who knows
