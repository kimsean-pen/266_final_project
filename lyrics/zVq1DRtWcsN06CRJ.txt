I saw innocent kids turn cruel
In the playground at school
Poor Claudius played the fool
Survival is cool
One for the space
To prowl as you please
Two for the pulpit
Down on your knees
We've opened out hearts to shame
No-one's to blame

Hey!
Everything was clearer than today
You have to hang on to your childhood
Open your eyes
Or stay as you are my friend
You have to hang on
Hang on

My life is a Milbury's home
On Hereford Way
My life is a Barclays' loan now,
And a mortgage to pay
Let's drink to freedom
And family ties
Here's to the bags
That are under my eyes
We've opened our eyes to pride
But there's nothing inside

Hey!
Everything was clearer than today
You have to hang on to your childhood
Open your eyes
Or stay as you are my friend
You have to hang on
Hang on

How have you been
I hope you go far
Together we'll stand
And prop up the bar
I'm watching you now
Cleaning your car
Open your eyes
Or stay as you are

Just a little more heart now
Just a little bit
Hang on
