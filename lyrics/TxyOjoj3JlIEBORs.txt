Tic toc, we heard the clock regain
The pendulum has finally moved again
Inactive for so long
Dreams were confined to a generic delusion
Sinking into obsolescence
There was nothing left to inspire our subsistence

As the Algorithm transcended
We can now redefine our progression
Embrancing the uncharted
Abstracting the relics into oblivion

Everlasting minds
Please liberate the hidden light
And shine upon us
As we reinvente our contrivance
And fix this miscalculation

Solo: Kevin

As the Algorithm transcended
We can now redefine our progression
Embrancing the uncharted
Abstracting the relics into oblivion

Solo: Simon

Gradually reconstructing our future
We'll seek for new elements
To ascend the enigma of life
And unify our existence
Through earth and universe

Solo: Hugo
