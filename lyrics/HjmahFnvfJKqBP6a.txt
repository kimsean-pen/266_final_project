From the minute that you walked
right through the door
thoughts were racing in my mind,
time to explore.

I tell my friends that
I just gotta have him
but don't look now 'cause
I see you staring at him.

Tunnel vision had him locked
on in my sight
on a mission for position
by the end of the night.

It's like a prey playing games
with the hunter,
nowhere to run boy time
to surrender.

And all I need is to feel you...
all I want is to feel you

(Reach out and touch me...)
before I go insane...
(reach out and touch me...)
boy don't you make me wait.

I'm a diamond
and you're so on the money...
(reach out and touch me...)
and all I need is to feel you...
(reach out and touch me).

Like a prayer your touch
can take me there,
in my mind you and me
in a secret affair.

Oh boy you're killing me
and you don't even know it,
tried to hold back but
I can't control it.

So I'm stepping to ya,
skip the how ya doing?
grab your hand and pull you
closer to me, yeah.

Out the door we're slipping
then we start to kissing
boy you're invited
to my fanta-tasy.

And all I need is to feel you...
all I want is to feel you

(Reach out and touch me...)
reach out, touch me baby...
(reach out and touch me...)
boy don't you make me wait.

I'm a diamond
and you're so on the money...
(reach out and touch me...)
reach out and touch me.

(Reach out and touch me...)
before I go insane...
(reach out and touch me...)
boy don't you make me wait.

I'm a diamond
and you're so on the money...
(reach out and touch me...)
and all I need is to feel you...
(reach out and touch me).

Baby, can't you see?
how you're affecting me?
baby sensual, physical, fantasy,
maybe fate brought the two
of us closer now.

Don't you wanna,
don't you wanna,
don't you wanna,
don't you wanna...
(reach out and touch me).

(Reach out and touch me...)
reach out, touch me baby...
(reach out and touch me...)
boy don't you make me wait.

I'm a diamond
and you're so on the money...
(reach out and touch me...)
reach out and touch me.

(Reach out and touch me...)
before I go insane...
(reach out and touch me...)
boy don't you make me wait.

I'm a diamond
and you're so on the money...
(reach out and touch me...)
and all I need is to feel you...
(reach out and touch me).
