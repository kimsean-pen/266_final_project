You try to get away from
Away from prying eyes
The ones that never stay shut
The ones they glamourise

And this corrosion is coming
Or is that all in your head?
And now you've misplaced your face
You wear another one instead

Because you're only half pure
You're only half pure
Where's the pain and the glamour that you were bred for?
You're only half pure
You're only half pure
Where's the pain and the glamour that you were bred for?

Don't you want to turn their heads some more?
Don't you want to know what you were bred for?
It's the pain, the glamour
The sound when you stammer
In vain, your manners
You're talking to an empty face, and
Don't you want to know what you were bred for?
