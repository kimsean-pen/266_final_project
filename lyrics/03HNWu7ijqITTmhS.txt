Black sludge
Flowing down the river bed
Below the surface, a colossus
Dark tongue
Speaking of the bitter end
The insane
Carving our names on tombstones

An act of disservice
There is nothing new
Give up and ignore the chosen
To break through the dam
Inside of you

Afraid to hope in vain
Betrayed
Force the end
Culminate

Our world's new state
Lying in wait
The dawn is rising
The dawn is here

The embers glowing at dawn
The ashes of our past
It's spreading over our soil
It's spreading sickness and mould Corrupting what was thriving
The embers glowing at dawn
The righteous overthrowing the unjust

Downfall
The chosen ones are overthrown
The wall will wither and fade
Towers skeletal and overgrown
A sign reminding us of our duty
