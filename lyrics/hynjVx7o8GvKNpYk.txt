Tonight, we'll fly away so high
Our first full moon sky

I'll breathe you in
I won't let you down
I won't hold you back
I won't make a sound
I know what scares you the most

Being alone or just like them
Being alive while feeling so, dead
At least you'll have my heart

You know, you shine so bright
I got a single silver bullet
Shot right through my heart
To prove I can survive
Without you

I got a single silver bullet
Shot right through my heart
To prove I can survive

Can you sleep at night
If I hold you tight?
I won't let you go
This feels so right

Please don't leave this time

At least you'll have my heart
You know, you shine so bright

I got a single silver bullet
Shot right through my heart
To prove I can survive
Without you

I got a single silver bullet
Shot right through my heart
To prove I can survive
Without you

Tonight, we'll fly away so high
Tonight, we'll fly away
You know the moon is full and
I can't live without you

Tonight, we'll fly away
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, we'll fly away
Tonight

I got a single silver bullet
Shot right through my heart
To prove I can survive
Without you

I got a single silver bullet
Shot right through my heart
To prove I can survive
Without you
