Midnight on a beach in the Mediterranean
And I miss you even here, taking it all in
The sand silvered carries the moon on it's shoulders
Is it possible to put this night to tune and move it to you?

And move it to you and move it to you
And move it to you and move it to you
And move it to you and move it to you
And move it to you

Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move
Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you

Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move
Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you

Cargo ships move by tracing on the horizon line
There's a luster from the city lights on the waves that kiss our feet
And we're thinkin' of goin' in
(And we're thinkin' of goin' in and we're thinkin' of goin' in)
The time's getting thin
(The time's getting thin, the time's getting thin)

Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move
Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this, if I can make this

Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move
Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you

This is a city for not sleeping and the clocks are set by feel
At this moment from where I sit, none of it seems real

Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move
Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move

Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move
Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move
If I can make this night light enough to move
