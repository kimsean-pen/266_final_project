Imagine me and you, i do
i think about you day and night
it's only right
to think about the girl you love

and hold her tight
So happy together
If I should call you up
Invest a dime

And you say you belong to me
And ease my mind
Imagine how the world would be
So very fine

So happy together
I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me

Baby the skies will be blue
For all my life
Me and you
And you and me

No matter how they toss the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me

So happy together
If I should call you up
Invest a dime
and you say you belong to me

and ease my mind

imagine how the world could be
so very fine
so happy together
I can't see me loving nobody but you

For all my life
When you're with me
Baby the skies will be blue
For all my life

I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me
Baby the skies will be blue

For all my life
For all my life...
Call you up
ease my mind
ease my mind
ease my mind
I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me
Baby the skies will be blue
For all my life
I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me
Baby the skies will be blue
For all my life
So happy together
So happy together
So happy together
So happy together
