Razor wire
Gift wraps the things we've done
Afterthoughts
Of past storms weathered before

Oh no! Oh no! I watch the clouds roll in
Oh no! Oh no! It's happening again, I'll be
Watching, waiting, dreadful, shaking
Will the storm pass over us today?
Will lightning strike our sins away?
Watching, waiting, fallen, shaking
Will the storm pass over us today?
Or is the future looking grey?

Aftermath
Much worse than it was before
Battle scars
Some are seen and some are not

Oh no! Oh no! I watch the clouds roll in
Oh no! Oh no! It's happening again, I'll be
Watching, waiting, dreadful, shaking
Will the storm pass over us today?
Will lightning strike our sins away?
Watching, waiting, fallen, shaking
Will the storm pass over us today?
Or is the future looking grey

You can't hide from thunder
And I never thought we'd turn out this way, yeah
You can't hide from thunder

Watching, waiting, dreadful, shaking
Will the storm pass over us today?
Will lightning strike our sins away?
Watching, waiting, fallen, shaking
Will the storm pass over us today?
Or is the future looking grey?

Hey, hey!
