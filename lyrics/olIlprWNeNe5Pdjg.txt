Burn it all down, need o buy another round
Gonna light up in the sound of the speaker
Knee socks, drink tequila on the rocks
Till you make your body pops to the speaker

Burn it all down, need to buy another round
Gonna light up in the sound of the speaker
Show your knee socks, drink tequila on the rocks
Till you make your body pops to the speaker

I wanna go
Downtown where my posse's at
Because I got nine lives like a kitty cat
You wanna roll, that's how I roll
I wanna go
Bling-bling when I hear that bass
I'm gonna do
My thing if you wanna taste
You better know, that's how I roll

Feel the earthquake, gonna make your body shake
Till the circuits starts to break in the speaker
Can we get fly? Helicopter in the sky
'Cause we turn it up high in the speaker

If you know what it takes to be my man
We can go make love together
You can be my fuck tonight
We can tear it up tonight

I wanna go
Downtown where my posse's at
Because I got nine lives like a kitty cat
You wanna roll, that's how I roll

I wanna go
Bling-bling when I hear that bass
I'm gonna do
My thing if you wanna taste
You better know, that's how I roll

Shimmy, shimmy oh
Shimmy oh, shimmy hey
We can give 'em what they want and we can take it away
Try our luck tonight, we can tear it up tonight
If you know what it takes to be my man
We can go make love together
You can be my fuck tonight, we can tear it up tonight

I wanna go
Downtown where my posse's at
Because I got nine lives like a kitty cat
You wanna roll, that's how I roll

I wanna go
Bling-bling when I hear that bass
I'm gonna do
My thing if you wanna taste
You better know, that's how I roll
