I got nowhere to be -
Talking about time isn't gonna stop me.
I got nothing to say -
Just taking it easy.
Taking it easy.
I feel calm in this state
Been working on kicking my freaking addiction.
Flowing through my veins,
The anger like a drug it bites me like a rattle, rattle.
Everyone, and everything,
Every soul, every being,
The same air we all are breathing:
One shared pulse collectively
Beating.
So go on, go-getters, go.
Keep aiming for the circus, dancing in the freak show.
Walk along the trail
Of bitter words from my tongue.
I hate that I can hate so
Well now.
I'm in a bout of sinking through the
Dark clouds.
(glory, glory, glory)
Well, now,
I'm in a bout of sinking through the
Darkest clouds.
(glory, glory, glory)
Everyone, and everything,
Every soul, every being,
The same air we all are breathing:
One shared pulse collectively
Beating.
Everyone, and everything,
Every soul, every being,
The same air we all are breathing:
One shared pulse collectively
Beating.
I believe
The sweetest tragedy
Is when the old you dies
(i-i-i-ies)
Dies
(i-i-i-ies. Yeah.)
Everyone, and everything,
Every soul, every being,
The same air we all are breathing:
One shared pulse collectively
Beating.
Everyone, and everything,
(everyone and everything)
Every soul, every being,
(every soul, every being)
The same air we all are breathing:
(the same air, the same air)
One shared pulse collectively
(YEEEAH!)
Beating.
(YEAH! GLORY, GLORY)
