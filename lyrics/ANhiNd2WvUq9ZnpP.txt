I feel your temperature rise
Each time i lock on your eyes
But then its no surprise you pass on by me
Until my very last day
I'll bow down and give it all away
I'm calling out for you to come and find me
People will talk, people will talk
It doesn't matter much to me
People will talk, people will talk, you mean everything to me
In love with the notion
This idea you came to me and
I second that emotion silently
Until my very last day
I'll bow down and give it all away
I'm calling out for you to come and find me
People will talk, people will talk
It doesn't matter much to me
People will talk, people will talk
You really mean the word to me
People will talk, people will talk
You mean everything to me
You really mean the world to me
It doesn't matter much to me
It doesn't matter much to me
It doesn't matter much to me
It doesn't matter much to me
You mean everything to me
You really mean the world to me
