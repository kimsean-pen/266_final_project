There's a lot of things that I may not know
But missing you baby is the only thing I know
I know
And who am I to say what the future holds
But missing you baby Is the only thing I know
I know
If my heart was paper, I'd fold it
Throw it to the wind and just hope it
Ends up with you
I signed it with love from me to you
I tried to be cool
But my feelings they don't allow me to
And all that I ask
Is that at least you write me back
I'm waiting
Here's my paper heart
Won't you hold it, hold it
Said you needed space
so I gave you time
A year has gone by
and I'm thinking you're still mine
In my mind
And I've written you this letter
Like a hundred times
To start a conversation
that we should have had that night
I tried
If my heart was paper, I'd fold it
Throw it to the wind and just hope it
Ends up with you
I signed it with love from me to you
I tried to be cool
But my feelings they don't allow me to
And all that I ask
Is that at least you write me back
I'm waiting
Here's my paper heart
Won't you hold it, hold it
Flying through fields over sand
Hoping one day it will land
And ends up with you
I signed it with love from me to you
I tried to be cool
But my feelings they won't allow me to
And all that I ask
Is that at least you write me back
I'm waiting
Here's my paper heart
And I just hope it
Ends up with you
I signed it with love from me to you
I tried to be cool
But my feelings they don't allow me to
And all that I ask
Is that at least you write me back
I'm waiting
Here's my paper heart, won't you hold it
Hold it
Hold it, hold it
There's a lot of things that I may not know
But missing you baby is the only thing I know
I know
