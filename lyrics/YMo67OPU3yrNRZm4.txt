Woh, old man trouble
Stop knockin' at my door
You used to be a good friend of mine
Let me tell you, hang around me no more
Heartache, stop knockin' at my window
I don't wanna hear what you have to say
You can go down your list of trouble
And be on your merry way
'Coz I found the love I need a long time
I found the love to ease my troubled mind
Love, blind, hanging over my head
All of this time so it won't rain on me
He's my sunshine and your loving me
Gonna set me free, yeah
Mmm, sadness, I have no more use for you
I know you can leave me by, you were nothing for years
If I find someone to take away my trouble
Ring of sadness doing me
Well, I found the love I need a long time
I found the love to ease my troubled mind
Well, I found the love I need a long time
