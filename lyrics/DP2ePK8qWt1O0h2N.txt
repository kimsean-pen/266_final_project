Said, I've been around the world
Wrote a million songs, it's all a bore to me
I've slept in the gutter and I've lied with the dogs
It never bothered me

Said, the sheriff he come too with his little boys in blue
They been lookin' for me, child
But with my crystal sheen guitar, I'm another ego star
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, yeah, yeah

Get me to the stage, it brings me home again
This is Shangrila
I'm trippin' on it now, it brings me home again
This is Shangrila

Said, I look bad in shorts but most of us do
Don't let that bother me
I'm a [Incomprehensible] knows who and I don't believe in smack
So don't you die on me, babe, don't you die on me

'Cause love is all good people need
And music sets the sick ones free
Without love no one ever grows
Nothing will ever sing

Because this is Shangrila, honey
And you have gathered for the feast
My bread is your body, the wine is blood, child
The wine is blood, babe
The wine is, give it to me

Get me to the stage, it brings me home again
Sing it, this is Shangrila
I'm trippin' on it now, it brings me home again
This is Shangrila

Get me to the stage, it brings me home again
I'm trippin' on it now, it brings me home again
