Even with all odds against me, I
Seem to find my way
Even with the whole world against me, I
I seem to find my way
Oh my God

Is it me, am I static, stuck on a chapter?
Over-dramatic, can't let it happen
All this shit lists that don't matter
Gotta let 'em pass for the good
And even when the demons come, I won't let 'em get me
Treat me wrong, tell you, "Please don't hit me"
All along, knew I had it in me, babe

But you like, "What if, in the end, this is the only life we get?"
I'm only invested 'cause I wanna live it big
If I would've known I would've been a better kid
I swear to God

Even with all odds against me, I
Seem to find my way
Even with the whole world against me, I
I seem to find my way
Oh my God

And I hope that you know that I'm there when you need me
Especially when the whole world is against me, yeah
And I want you to know that they'll never get me
Especially when the whole world is against me

I get to see you like this
I wanna see through more than just hot
Is it not true? Kinda hot
Don't you let the time fly by

(But you like) "What if, in the end, this is the only life we get?"
I'm only invested 'cause I wanna live it big
If I would've known I would've been a better kid
I swear to God

Even with all odds against me, I
Seem to find my way
Even with the whole world against me, I
I seem to find my way
Swear to God (Yeah), oh
