I'm stranded alone in the desert
In these red tides of sand form the sea
Confessed to a man, he's not quite a man so to speak
Electric fire filled with my desire
Can you hear the engines turning?
Life will never tire
Breathing upwards towards
The eyes in the trees

Soft winds blow
Through these fields
Desert domes
These strange things

Electric fire filled with my desire
Can you hear the engines turning
Life will never tire

Clocks stopped time
Warm light glows
Wishful sleep
Moonlight slows

For the people forcing us to stay
And the prophets
Lead us on our way (They will not be told)
Through the ages leading us astray (They will not be told)
But the people, nothing more to say

For the people forcing us to stay
And the prophets
Lead us on our way (They will not be told)
Through the ages leading us astray (They will not be told)
But the people nothing more to say
But the prophets leading us astray
The prophets leading us astray
