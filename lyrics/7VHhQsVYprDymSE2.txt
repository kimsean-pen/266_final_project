Would you believe me if I told the reasons why
You can't rest, and drink yourself to sleep at night?
Now, like it matters, you can't escape, don't even try
We speak what no one knows

(Oh, I've got to get to sleep)

You lie awake and you hope it's all in your head
You're counting teeth with your tongue, are they all there?
There's no relief in the dark from what isn't there
But you don't feel alone

We are the ones you should be fearing
Coming in the night and take your teeth away
Now sew up your mouth, and go to sleep, 'cause
We'll be there soon to break your heart and spite your face

Now they're finally here and you know what they're looking for
With their empty grins they proceed in taking what you owe
And you move your lips, but the words, they just fall to the floor
So this is how it ends

Crawl to the mirror and see it, all that you've become
A grim reflection of all the things that you have done
You try to weep, but no tears never will ever come
So this is who you are

We are the ones you should be fearing
Coming in the night and take your teeth away
Now sew up your mouth and go to sleep, 'cause
We'll be there soon to break your heart and spite your face

All the stars will burn out sometime
We hang by our own rope
All the stars will burn out sometime
We suffer from inward growth

We are the ones you should be fearing
Coming in the night and take your teeth away
Now sew up your mouth and go to sleep, cause
We'll be there soon to break your heart and spite your faith
