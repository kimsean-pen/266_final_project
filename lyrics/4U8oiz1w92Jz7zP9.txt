[Thurston]
Lights on the stones on backed up drain
Warped lovers loosed on languid stain
We've come together to gather stars
Shooting up stones our powdered hearts

Dead or alive
There's danger
The dead are all right, with me
We're not gonna run away,
We're not gonna leave you stranger
Turn the light on, yr lonely love

Camera on the haunted stones
Bloodshed a gentle painted score
Notes dance in ink across yr skin
Heiroglyphic lover, nature friend

Dead or alive
There's danger
The dead are all right, with me
We're not gonna run away,
We're not gonna leave you stranger
Turn the light on, yr lonely love
