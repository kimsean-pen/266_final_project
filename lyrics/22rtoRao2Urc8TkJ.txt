How will this pan out
Search and wish so loud
Keep a candle burning
To each his own should live

Before I turn in envy
I learn through sorrow
I turn in envy
And go to the wall

See how the colors run
And feel your Sunday rest
Give me a name
Bring it in
Some change is for the best
I may not win the race
I may not reach the top
Or I may not live your way
Doesn't mean I'm stuck here
We may not fit the mold
Kind of going off
Well, the medicine inside
Takes a stronger hold
As we

Turn in envy
I learn through sorrow
I turn in envy
And go to the wall

Before I burn with envy
I learn through sorrow
I burn with envy
And go to the wall
To the wall
To the wall

Before I turn envy
I learn through sorrow
I burn with envy
And go
To the wall
