Where have all the virgins gone
Sleepin' on their parents lawn
Bad kids sent to summer school
Skip to skate in the empty pool

No one seems to listen
The pool is no exception
Don't ever change
Bad is good enough

Please won't you stay with me
I'm beggin' tonight
I'll hold back your hair
If you're not feelin' alright
There's nothin' left for us here
This town has spit us out dear

I track my feet up and down these halls
I write my name on the bathroom walls
There's nothin' sacred to me
I lost it in the back seat

Where have all the virgins gone
Sleepin' on their parents lawn
Bad kids sent to summer school
Skip to skate in the empty pool

No one seems to listen
The pool is no exception
Don't ever change
Bad is good enough

I believe there's room for friends
And all the beds
And all their friends
Are what they said
Opposites attract sometimes
And others frown
That love is blind
And I don't mind
Yeah!
Yeah!

Where have all the virgins gone
Sleepin' on their parents lawn
Don't ever change
Bad is good enough

Where have all the virgins gone
Sleepin' on their parents lawn
Bad kids sent to summer school
Skip to skate in the empty pool

No one seems to listen
The pool is no exception
Don't ever change
Bad is good enough
