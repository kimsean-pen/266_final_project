Fresh from Moscow
Over Volga came to comrades aid
City in despair
Almost crushed by the f√ºhrers army

Oh it's colder than hell
Hitler's forces advancing

The sound of mortars
The music of death
A grand symphony

See your friends fall
Hear them pray to the god your country denies
Every man dies alone
And when your time comes you will know that it's time

Stalin's fortress on fire
Is this madness or hell

The sound of the mortars
The music of death
We're playing the devils symphony
Our violins are guns conducted from hell

Oh Stalingrad!
Mratnimiat!

Are you playing?
Do you follow the conductor's lead?
No one knows you
No one cares about a single violin

Play the score of the damned
Know the devil within.
