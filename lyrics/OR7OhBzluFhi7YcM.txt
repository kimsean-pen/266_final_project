of all the minutes I'd shut just to hold you down.
my compunction led me back into the day you'd hit the ground.
such inflicted hours resent me, i try not to make a sound.
after months had fled yet you'd still be nowhere to be found.
i'll see you when i see you around.

farewell, dear life.
adieu, can't you help us out?
take care, later on.
au revoir, can you save us now?
the remembrance of your presence haunts me in-between.
as if your apparition creeps within my tireless scream.

your season's off and i took the crown.
a weekly reminder you're no longer a part of this cryptic town.
in a second chance i slipped, did it leave me so unbound?
misleading year had gotten me closer to feel it drown.
i'll strive it for another round.

farewell, dear life.
adieu, can't you help us out?
take care, later on.
au revoir, can you save us now?
very well, belated life.
adieu, can't you hear us out?
take care, later on.
au revoir, can you sense us now?

the remembrance of your presence haunts me in-between.
as if your aspiration sleeps within my timeless dream.
the resemblance of your essence curses me in-between.
as if your apparition creeps within my tireless scream.
