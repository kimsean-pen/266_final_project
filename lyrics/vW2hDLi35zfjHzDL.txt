If I go hard, let me tell you that it's worth it
Play the right cards, I ain't afraid to work it
Brush em right off, when they say I don't deserve it
Hands on my heart, you keep my fire burning

Ooh it feels so crazy when you scream my name
Love it when you rock me over every day
When I think about it I could go insane
Here we are as beautiful, I'm blown away

If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild

If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild

When it get rough, then the rain starts pouring
I turn up the heat cause the drama ain't important
Let em all talk talk, I'mma just ignore it
Hands on my heart, you you keep me moving forward

Ooh it feels so crazy when you scream my name
Love it when you rock me over every day
When I think about it I could go insane
Here we are as beautiful, I'm blown away

If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild

If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild

Woahoo

I'm so intrigued by the way you love
Wish I could stay underneath your touch
Forever you will be by my side
I'm not afraid of running wild

If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild

If this is a dream, won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild
