There's something in the air tonight
That makes me think of you
I don't care what I have to do
I'll make it home to you

But oh, my God
You're so far away
It's such a drag
All I can do is sing to you

There's something in the
Way she drops my name
Oh, it drives me crazy
All I wanna do is
Lay in bed all day long
And kiss like crazy

But you're so far away
It's such a drag
All I can do is sing to you
