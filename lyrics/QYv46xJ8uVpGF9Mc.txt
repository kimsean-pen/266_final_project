So this is the end of the story
Everything we had, everything we did
Is buried in dust
And this dust is all that's left of us

But only a few ever worried
Though the signs were clear, we had no idea
You just get used to living in fear or give up
When you can't even picture the future, the future

Some people offered up answers
We made out like we heard, they were only words
And didn't add up to a change in the way we were living
And the saddest thing was, all of it could have been avoided

But it was like to stop consuming's to
Stop being human and why'd I make the change if you won't
We're one and the same, just staying afloat for the moment
For a moment

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it, it makes no sense
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it, it makes no sense

But I'm desperate to connect
You can't live like this
And you can't live like this
