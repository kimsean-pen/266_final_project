Save your prayers, God is not here with us now
There is onIy the darkness here
Fight, fight
You cannot win the death

Cult of the scarecrow, self-destructive belief
Mass contradiction, the cancer within
Religious fanatics, psychotic breed
Dogma discordant, their sacrosancts bleed

Rancid impostor, inglorious ring
Abortion of religion, scourge of all life
Fouling redemptor, regent of pigs
Swinefever

Reign of deception, oppressed and enslaved
Lies of salvation, ignorance praised
Prophets beheaded, defiled and condemned
Missa solemnis, choirs of the dead

Rancid impostor, inglorious ring
Abortion of religion, scourge of all life
Fouling redemptor, regent of pigs
Swinefever

Golden stairs to heaven for those who repent
In excelsis dementia ethereal stench

Rancid impostor, inglorious king
Abortion of religion, scourge of all life
Fouling redemptor, Herrscher der Schweine
Swinefever
