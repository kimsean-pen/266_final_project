I'm ashamed of how I acted
When I thought I was in love
I can only chalk it up to
Being young and unencumbered

I have shame
Oh, I have shame
I have shame
And I carry it with me
Shame

If I hurt you,
Caused you damage
You can name me
Like an actor
I lay my head down
Right beside you
I am yours now
I am the problem,
I am conditioned
Thrill of the chase
And afraid to listen
But I'll let my guard down
I'll stand beside you
I am yours now
Baptized and carrying shame
I have shame
And I carry it with me

Shame
Wherever I go
I have shame
Oh, shame
I have shame
I carry it with me
Shame
Oh, shame
Oh, shame

Shame
Oh, shame
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame, ooh
