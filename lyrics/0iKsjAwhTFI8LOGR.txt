People tell me you didn't know better
Give me sermons 'bout the things I do
Come to love 'em, even wrote letters
You know I even asked it of you, I said

I've been doing poison (Poison)
I guess I poisoned my life
I've got my poison (Poison)
It's better than marrying my wife

On the road, the pace is getting frantic
Especially when you're poisoned out your mind
A flight of stairs is like swimming the Atlantic
When you're poisoned, deaf, dumb and blind

I take my poison (Poison)
I guess I poisoned my life
I wish I was poisoned (Poison)
I wish I'd poisoned my wife

My father, he used to be a preacher
Never taught me nothing but scorn
If I ever catch him on the street, yeah
I'll make him wish he'd never been born, because

He was poison (Poison)
I know he poisoned my life
Yeah, he was poison (Poison)
I wish my own mother wasn't his wife, no

Poison
