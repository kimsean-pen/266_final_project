Oh we get lost in the morning scapes
Down in the darkness where no one will find us for days
She keeps me burning
Keeps me close to her flames
And I'm cursing the years when my ears were untrained in her name

I never wanted anybody else
No I never wanted anybody else
And whenever she leaves me behind
I become a fool not to be by her side
Oh I never wanted anybody else

Oh my baby's a heartbreaker
She'll all night
And I'm the one woman man who can't stand fighting shy of her light
Oh she keeps me moving on
Make me feel alright
But all of my wandering rows they just can't bring me home to her sight

I never wanted anybody else
No I never wanted anybody else
And whenever she leaves me behind
I become a fool not to be by her side
Oh I never wanted anybody else

Well every lord I pray doesn't sound the same
When she's not resting
She's not rested
And I am missing her

I never wanted anybody else
No I never wanted anybody else
And whenever she leaves me behind
I become a fool not to be by her side
Oh I never wanted anybody else
