Long way home
Sea so deep
Hard way home
Sea so addictive
Long way home
Sea so deep
Hard way home
Sea so addictive
I find myself in waves
But in truth I'm going home
I find myself in waves
But in truth I'm going home
You clog your ears
But I want to hear
your skull I revel in like a sea gull
You clog your ears
But I want to hear
your skull I revel in like a sea gull
You clog the ears
But I want to hear
your skull I revel in like a sea gull
You clog yours ears
But I want to hear
your skull I revel in like a sea gull
Long way home
Sea so deep
Hard way home
Sea so addictive
Long way home
Sea so deep
Hard way home
Sea so addictive
I find myself in mermaids
But in truth I'm going home
I find myself in mermaids
But in truth I'm going home
You clog your ears
But I want to hear
Your skull I revel in like a sea gull
You clog your ears
But I want to hear
Your skull I revel in like a sea gull
You clog your ears
But I want to hear
Your skull I revel in like a sea gull
You clog your ears
But I want to hear
Your skull I revel in like a sea gull
You clog your ears
But I want to hear
Your skull I revel in like a sea gull
You clog your ears
But I want to hear
Your skull I revel in like a sea gull
