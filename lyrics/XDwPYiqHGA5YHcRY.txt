Taste the poison from your lips
They leave, we're as good as gone
Oh, our love is drunkenness
Singing me my favorite song

Me and you, we were made to break
I know that's true, but it's much too late

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me

You're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

Oh, you know how much it hurts
Every time you say you hate me
But when we're making love, you make it worth it
I can't believe the places that you take me

There's no use, we were made to be
I know the truth, and it's much too late

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me

Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

Oh, and why can't I quit?
When you break my heart open
I need you more than I know
Oh, and I can't resist when you're up against my skin
I never wanted let you go

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me

Mhh
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me

Ohh
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, yeah

Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
