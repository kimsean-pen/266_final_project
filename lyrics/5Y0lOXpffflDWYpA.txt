I wanna see you girl
I wanna please you girl
Go head and be you girl
Can't wait to see you girl (I wanna)
I haven't see you in a while you know I miss you babe
When you hear this song for flatter its about to fade
And how I miss it and I wish that I could see you more
But you're in college now and I'm about to go on tour
I wanna see you girl
I wanna please you girl
Go head and be you girl
Can't wait to see you girl (I wanna)
