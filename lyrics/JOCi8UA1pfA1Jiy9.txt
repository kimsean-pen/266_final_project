I don't like it when you break me honey
Why'd you have to do that?
Tell me when you make these tears keep fallin'
Do you feel like a man?
Figure figure, there's no working you out whatsoever
Only one way I could sum you up all together
You've got a black heart

Daddy I've fallen for a monster
Somehow he's scaring me to death
Ah yes he is
He's big and he's bad
I love him like mad
Mamma he's the best I ever had
Daddy I've fallen for a monster
He got a black heart

No walls to build around me honey
'Cause you blew my house down
Sticks and stones won't put it back up for me
And that's where we're at now
Ahh, sicker sicker, I ain't feeling your mouth whatsoever
A name it hurts me more the way from around but whatever
You've got a black heart

Daddy I've fallen for a monster
Yeah!
Somehow he's scaring me to death
Oh, Yes he is
He's big and he's bad
I love him like mad
Mamma he's the best I ever had (best i ever had)
Daddy I've fallen for a monster
He got a black heart

Daddy I've fallen for a monster
Ohhh
Somehow he's scaring me to death (YEAH!)

He's big and he's bad
I love him like mad
Mamma he's the best I ever had (oh yes he is)
Daddy I've fallen for a monster
He got a black heart
He got a black heart
He got such a dirty black heart in him
Ain't it girls (yeah)

I love him like mad
Ohh yes I do
He got a black heart
