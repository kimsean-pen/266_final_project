They stopped talking
Or did they?
Yeah, they did
And it's obvious why I'm a mess
They couldn't resist
I'm the one who starts
I'll give you what you want
Yeah, I'll do
And you will let me go on and on
It starts on a kiss

Please let me walk around
Let everyone stare into my soul
Fantasizing
It's fascinating
How everyone needs to be like this

The craziest part 'bout all of this
Is that everyone thinks I'm the crazy one

Please let me walk around
Let everyone stare right into my soul
Fantasizing
It's fascinating
How everyone needs to be like this
Like this
