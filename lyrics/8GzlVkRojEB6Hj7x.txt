What holds your hope together
Make sure it's strong enough
When you reach the end of your tether
It's because it wasn't strong enough

I was going to drown
Then I started swimming
I was going down
Then I started winning
Winning, winning, winning

When you're on the bottom
Crawl back to the top
Something pulls you up
And a voice says you can't stop

I was going to drown
Then I started swimming
I was going down
But now I started winning
Winning, winning

Winning, I'm winning
Winning, I'm winning
