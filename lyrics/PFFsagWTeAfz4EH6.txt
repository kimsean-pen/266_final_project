Don't Think Twice, It's All Right
Waylon Jennings
Notes: also performed by "Peter, Paul and Mary"
It ain't no use in calling out my name, Girl
Like you never did before
Ain't no use in calling out my name, Girl
I can't hear for you any more
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason why I'm traveling on
Don't think twice, it's all right
Walking down that long lonesome road, Girl
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Good-bye is too good a word, Girl
So I'll just say Fare thee well
We'll in saying you treated me unkind
You could've done better, but I don't mind
You just sort of wasted my precious time
Don't think twice, it's all right
It ain't no use in turning on your light, Babe
That light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, Babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there were something you would do or say
Make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
Don't think twice, it's all right
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, Babe
It don't matter any how
Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, Babe
If you don't know by now
I'm a thinking and a wounded all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told
I gave her my heart, but she wanted my soul
Don't think twice, it's all right
