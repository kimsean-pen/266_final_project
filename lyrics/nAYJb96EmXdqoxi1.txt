You got to dance closer to the ones that you love
You got to dance closer to the ones that you love
You got to dance closer to the ones that you love
You got to dance closer to the ones that you love
Feel the rhythm with me
What must I do to make you see
Baby we could be a groove
Feel the rhythm with me
What must I do to make you see
Baby we could be a groove
You and I together
Dancing this rhythm
Rhythm of love, rhythm of love
