I did it for love
I did it for love
I did it for love
I did it for love

No signs for me
I saw your game but yet
and still you got me
You touched the deepest part of me
You got my heart it's jumping
I told you all of my secrets
Didn't see betrayal
One day two months
And now it's over
Didn't think it would fail

Loving you is causing me to change
And it hurts so bad it don't feel the same
And now my friends are asking me
"What did I do?"
Im done hurtin' myself over loving you
Oh I

I I I I did it did it did it for love (I know that I did you wrong)
Please forgive me baby girl I'm sorry
(You know that you did me wrong)
Why you crying baby girl I'm sorry
(I know that I did you wrong)
Heaven knows I don't mean to hurt nobody
(You know that you did me wrong)
Let me take this time to say I'm sorry

Loving you is causing me to change
And it hurts so bad it don't feel the same
And now my friends are asking me
"What did I do?"
Im done hurtin' myself over loving you
Oh I

I I I I did it did it did it for love I had some injunctions baby
But I'm done hurtin' you
Wanna make it up to you

Didn't you see in it my heart?
I can't trust it anymore

I I I I I ... want to make it up to you Didn't you see it in my heart?
I can't trust it anymore

I I I I did it did it did it for love Did it for love Did it did it for love
