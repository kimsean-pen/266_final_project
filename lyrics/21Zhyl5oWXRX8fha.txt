Grab my knee and look at me
And try to tell me, I'll be home soon
Asleep in my bed and unstoned
I'm tired of me this way

I don't know what I've gotten into
But I'm glad that it's now instead of sooner
This desert heat has crowded me strong
With a wish I had for winter

It's not as gentle as it sounds
As though it sounded yesterday
When I heard a leaf of my life hit the ground
And as a bottle cap flew from my fingers

I don't know what I've gotten into
But I'm glad that it's now instead of sooner
This desert heat has crowded me strong
With a wish I had for winter

And the sand blew in my eyes
I stood on the edge and looked down to see
The light of a new life
Shining upon me

I don't know what I've gotten into
But I'm glad that it's now instead of sooner
This desert heat has crowded me strong
It's crowded me strong
With a wish that I had
With a wish I had

Sand blew in my eyes
Sand blew in my eyes
Sand blew in my eyes
...
