Such a shame
To believe in escape
A life on every face
But that's a change
Until I'm finally left with an 8
Tell me to relax, I just stare
Maybe I don't know
If I should change
A feeling that we share

It's a shame (such a shame)
Number me with rage
It's a shame (such a shame)
Number me in haste (such a shame)
This eagerness to change

It's a shame

The dice decide my fate
That's a shame, that's a shame)
In these trembling hands my faith
Tells me to react
I don't care
Maybe it's unkind if I should change
A feeling that we share

It's a shame (such a shame)
Number me with rage
It's a shame (such a shame)
Number me in haste (such a shame)
This eagerness to change

Such a shame
(Number me with the rage)
Such a shame
(Write across my name)

It's a shame (such a shame)
Number me with rage
It's a shame (such a shame)
Number me in haste (such a shame)
This eagerness to change

Such a shame
Such a shame
