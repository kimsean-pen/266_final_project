I look about seventy years older
It feels like minutes
But really it's hours
The cooling pavements calling my name
And the zooming street signs
Don't look the same, no
Don't know why, but I think I'm ready for it
Yeah, I think I'm ready for

Running on concrete, electricity
I finally can breathe
I think I'm ready for
Only you and me
We made it out it seems
I made it out it seems
I think I'm ready to

Grow, to grow, to grow, to grow
Familiar sounds
The lake holds all our secrets
Nostalgia bound
Yeah, I'll take my time, move all then

Dreaming of phonecalls
You knew all along
The way we joked 'til
We laughed our tails off
See it all unfold
An emerald life before me
Yeah, I think I'm ready for

Running on concrete, electricity
I finally can breathe
I think I'm ready for
Only you and me
We made it out it seems
I made it out it seems
I think I'm ready to

Grow, to grow, to grow, to grow
Yeah, I see it coming, I see it coming
Oh, boy, I'm running, oh, boy, I'm running
I see it coming, I see it coming
Oh, boy, I'm running

And oh, boy, I'm running, running
Grow, to grow, to grow, to grow
Your reality, don't know where it'll lead
But everything's a dream
I think I'm ready for
Only you and me
We made it out it seems
I made it out it seems
I think I'm ready, ready
