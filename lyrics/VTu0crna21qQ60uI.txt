They're making the last film
they say it's the best
And we all helped make it
It's called the death of the West

the kids from Fame will all be there
Free cocacola for you!
And all the monkeys from the zoo
Will they be extras too?

They're making the last film
they say it's the best
And we all helped make it
It's called the death of the West

A star is rising in our northern sky
And on it we're crucified
A chain of gold is wrapped around this world
We're ruled by those who lie
