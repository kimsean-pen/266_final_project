One last illusion
A powdered mirage
Hidden feelings
Swallowed by the red sand

Sudden vortex of tormented damned souls
Of blindness and buried honor
I recall the sacred starflames
The great fury of the tornado
Holy force

Water, fire
Wind and earth arise
Arise

A lonely trace of sorrow
One melancholic whisper
A cell of silent matter
Evolving to new forms of life

Ancient flesh and blood
Scream for vengeance
Beneath this unstable surface
The ground is shaking, the Earth is quaking
It's the dark fate they once asked for

It's nothing but sand after all
Holy force

Water, fire
Wind and earth arise

CHORUS:
STONE SOULS CAUGHT IN DESERT STORMS
(DESERT STORMS)
ONCE CHAINED GHOSTS OF FORGOTTEN WORLDS
(DUSTY WORLDS)
CHAOS BORN SAND LORDS

Solo.

Water, fire
Wind and earth arise

CHORUS:
STONE SOULS CAUGHT IN DESERT STORMS
(DESERT STORMS)
ONCE CHAINED GHOSTS OF FORGOTTEN WORLDS
(DUSTY WORLDS)

RISE SOULS CAUGHT IN DESERT STORMS
(DESERT STORMS)
ONCE CHAINED GHOSTS OF FORGOTTEN WORLDS
(DUSTY WORLDS)
CHAOS BORN SAND LORDS

Chaos born in desert storms
Once chained ghosts...
