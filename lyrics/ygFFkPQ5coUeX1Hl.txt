Ain't got no money
But I'm feeling swell
I hate this city
It's bad for my health
I want a lover
That hates themselves
So I can pity
And feel like I can help

It's been a minute
since I've ate these words and swallowed
(Keep on biting till I feel it)
Thirsty like a wolf, full of youth, but I'm hollow
(Keep on biting till I feel it)

I'm thirsty like a Wolf and I bite, and bite
Got your body on my mind and I bite, and bite
Yeah I'm thirsty like a Wolf and I bite, and bite
Got your body on my mind and I bite and bite
(Keep on biting till I feel it)

I won't admit it
But I'm not too well
I'd burn this city
But you can't burn this hell
I want a life
That I can smell
I need your touch
All over like carousel

It's been a minute
Since I ate these words and swallowed
(Keep on biting till I feel it)
Thirsty like a Wolf, full of youth, but I'm hollow
(Keep on biting till I feel it)

I'm thirsty like a Wolf and I bite, and bite
Got your body on my mind and I bite, and bite
Yeah I'm thirsty like a Wolf and I bite, and bite
Got your body on my mind and I bite, and bite
I'm thirsty like a Wolf and I bite, and bite
Got your body on my mind and I bite, and bite
Yeah I'm thirsty like a Wolf and I bite, and bite
Got your body on my mind and I bite, and bite

Sleepwalker, animal
Hiding from the world
I'm underneath, through the trees
Sleepwalker, animal
will you be my pearl
don't mind my teeth, when I breathe?

Sleepwalker, animal

(Keep on biting till I feel it)

I'm thirsty like a Wolf and I bite, and bite (I'm thirsty like Wolf)
Got your body on my mind and I

Yeah I'm thirsty like a Wolf and I
bite, and bite (I'm thirsty like Wolf)
I got your body on my mind and I
bite, and bite (I got your body on my mind)
I'm thirsty like a Wolf and I bite, and bite (yeah)
Got your body on my mind and I bite, and bite
Yeah I'm thirsty like a Wolf and I bite, and bite
Got your body on my mind and I bite, and bite

Keep on biting till I feel it
