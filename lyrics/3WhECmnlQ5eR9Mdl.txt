Wake up in the morning and I'm by myself
Sad and so depressed since you left
I hate to think that you're smiling with somebody else
And I know you'll never love me again
And I try & pretend that it's OK
That I'm doing better without you
Getting harder and harder every day
BUT, I'm just trying to make it through
Need your love
Need your touch
To keep it going
Need your lips
tender kiss
I'm so broke'n
You'll leave me, trying to let you go
BUT
I need you to know that it's difficult
Honey 't hurts
HONEY 't hurts
And I'm still coooope'n
'Ooooo
'Ooooooo
I'm still COooope'n
Oooooo.Ohhhohhh
I'm still coping
And I try and pretend that it's all OK
But I'm broken
Broken, yea
Harder and harder with every day
But I'm cope' n
I'm Cope'n'n'n'n'n
& Your love
& your touch
To Keep me go'n
'N your lips
Just a kiss
Cologne so cold
