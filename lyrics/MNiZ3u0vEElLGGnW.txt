I don't know what I'm doin'
I don't know what I've done
I don't know what I'm thinkin'
but I wanna have fun

I wanna get fucked up til the hurt goes away
but I always feel like shit when I wake up the next day
maybe I'll stay home and get on my knees and pray
but it always seems like god has nothin' to say

I wonder why
I wonder why
I wonder why
I wonder why

why do I feel so guilty for bein' myself
why did she have to leave me
and go fuck someone else

I cleaned up my act and I done it alone
I always look for signs that she's comin' home
can I change my fate or is the future in stone
seems like all I ever do is cry and moan

I wanna die
I wanna die
I wanna die
I wanna die

I don't know what life may have in store
I should just shut my mouth and be thankful
but I always want more

do I hope and have faith and make it through the night
do I lay in bed all day or do I get up and fight
wakin' up without my family well it just ain't right to me

it ain't right to me
it ain't the way it's supposed to be
baby why can't you see

sweet angel I loved you
all my fuckin life
I thought we'd grow old
with you as my wife

I can't even remember why you had to go
I wish I could see inside you but I'll never know
you ain't giving second chances to allow us to grow
I guess my only choice is to go with the flow

and say goodbye
and say goodbye
and say goodbye
so goodbye

I wonder why
I wonder why
I wonder why
I wonder why

I wanna die
I wanna die
I wanna die
I wanna die
