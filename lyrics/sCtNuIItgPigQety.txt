Your morals are feeble
Feel your fear arc to the ground
Untouchable sadistic godsend
One heinous strike will mark the end

Of your privilege to life, sanction denied
Hostile militia comes to strike your time
Immoral crimes, sentenced to life
Enter karma's domain

You'll give us your fucking life
Redemption by karma's knife

You're in our world now
No escape, in your wrong you drown
Kneel down, beg us for your life
Your fate is here, karma's knife

You plead to stop the bleeding
I spare no mercy for a spineless fool
How does it feel to be the prey?
On the other side, it's your time to pay

Destiny, justice by pain
Life starts to fade at the blade
Karma's knife
Karma's knife
Karma's knife
