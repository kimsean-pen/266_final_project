Tell me lies, slap me on the face
Just improvise, do something really clever
That'll make me hate your name forever

You might swear you'd never touch a lady
Well, let me say, you're not too far from maybe
Every day you find new ways to hurt me

But I can't help it if I'm just a fool
Always having my heart set on you
Till the time you start changing the rules
I'll keep chasing the soles of your shoes
Fool

God resigned from hearing my old story
Every night I'm paying hell for glory
I'm embarrassed, but I'm much more sorry

All this pain begins to feel like pleasure
With more tears, you'd make a sea a desert
Salt my wounds, and I'll keep saying "thank you"

But I can't help it if I'm just a fool
Always having my heart set on you
Till the time you start changing the rules
I'll keep chasing the soles of your shoes
Fool

But I can't help it if I'm just a fool
Always having my heart set on you
Till the time you start changing the rules
I'll keep chasing the soles of your shoes
Fool

I can't help it, baby
Fool
I can't help it, baby
Fool
I can't help it, baby
Fool
I can't help it, baby, baby
Fool
I'm a fool, I'm a fool
