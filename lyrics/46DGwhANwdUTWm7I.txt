What I've become will never show
As death shrouds my soul
A dead leaf in the autumn wind
That mimics a careless stroll

For I am still at bay
Neither alive nor dead
Blinded as I stare
Oh how I long to join them there
A thousand tears and a thousand hours
In a tomb never blessed

Contorted limbs reach the clouds
To shadow my limbs at rest
Utterly old, bleak and cold
Like a ghoul vaguely heard
Although my vision is crystal clear
My sight seems all blurred

Let my path be sacrosanct
Sacrosanct
Eternal black and sacrosanct
Forever sacrosanct

To veil my wicked sense
I close myself in a deathlike dream
Within the silence of immense
Lies a turmoil that twists and screams
As long as the night lies ahead
I shall extol the dead
For they have found the mirror brave
Where black is white and night is day
So bless my soul and bless my ways
But don't utter any words
Because II seek neither light nor day
But the darkest of all worlds

Sacrosanct be my dream
Sacrosanct and black
Now the mirror opens and invites me there
Never to go back

Let my path be sacrosanct
Sacrosanct
Eternal black and sacrosanct
Forever sacrosanct

Let my path be sacrosanct
Through the night eternal
Sacrosanct
Through silence nocturnal
Eternal black and sacrosanct
Let the darkness be my guide
Forever sacrosanct
Now the mirror opens wide
