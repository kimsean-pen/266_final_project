Your eyes are long Vermont roads
With a tacky song on the radio
And your eyes are toothless young men
In Tennessee in the rain again

And fireflies never go to sleep
And country songs never help you sleep

After all those trains and all those breakdown lanes
The roads don't love you and they still won't pretend to
After all those days on God-forsaken highways
The roads don't love you and they still won't pretend to

Your eyes are the Mesa Verde
Big and brown and far away
And your eyes are Kansas City
In Kansas and in Missouri

After all those trains and all those breakdown lanes
The roads don't love you and they still won't pretend to
After all those days on God-forsaken highways
The roads don't love you and they still won't pretend to

After all this time and after all your crying
The roads don't love you and they still won't pretend to
The roads are dark and long and all those country songs
Well, they don't love you and they still won't pretend to
