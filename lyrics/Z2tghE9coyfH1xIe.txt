I got a white-knuckle grip
On the steering wheel
My foot in the floor
Just to see how it feels, ugh (Yeah!) hmm (Yeah!)
I got my mind made up
Ain't got time to waste
As long as I can
I keep my dog in this race, ugh (Yeah!) hmm (Yeah!)

I gave you everything you wanted, yeah
Plus a little more
I promise you ain't never felt
Like this before

You got the b-b-b-b-blues, yeah
I heard that you lost your dancing shoes, yeah
The only thing I wanna do, yeah
So let the good times roll!
You got the b-b-b-b-blues, yeah
I've got the cure if you wanna use it
The only thing I wanna do, yeah
Is satisfy your soul!

Let me make this clear
There ain't no wrong way
Just do as I do
Or do as I say, babe (Yeah!) Ugh (Yeah!)
When the lights go down
The stars come out
Look over here
I'mma show you how, ugh (Yeah!) Yeah!

I give you everything you wanted, yeah
Plus a little more
I promise you ain't never felt
Like this before

You got the b-b-b-b-blues, yeah
I heard that you lost your dancing shoes, yeah
The only thing I wanna do, yeah
