Close your eyes
Stop dreaming of foregone days
We can never turn back time
Regretting the words we didn't say

Take my hand
Don't let it just pass us by
Now in our promised land
Here tonight, underneath the sky

Now the smoke is gone
And the storm has passed
And you finally caught your breath

Know it's over
And you're safe with me
I will guide you through the mess

When it all when down
Like a tidal wave
And it swept you off your feet

There's a time to heal
What's been so unreal
So believe me when I'll sing

Close your eyes
Stop dreaming of foregone days
We can never turn back time
Regretting the words we didn't say

Take my hand
Don't let it just pass us by
Now in our promised land
Here tonight, underneath the sky
