Some days you don't feel beautiful
Some days you wanna change it all.
I answer with a question mark
I love you just the way you are.
I'd change myself you ask me too
But there's one thing that I could not do.
No I wouldn't change a thing... About you.

You change the sky and make it shine
You know the way to change my mind.
You take my words and make them rhyme
You turn the water into wine.
All of the things you put you through
I wish you could see exactly what I do.
'Cause I wouldn't change a thing... About you.

But some day you wake up
And feel like you need love
You can't see your smile
Your eyes not the way that I do.
Don't ever feel worthless
Just know that your perfect
And I'd change the world before
I change a thing about you.

Some days you don't feel beautiful
Some days you wanna change it all.
You don't understand it's plain to see
You're just the way you're meant to be.
I'd change the world and make it new
But there's one thing that I would not do.
No I wouldn't change a thing... About you.

But some day you wake up
And feel like you need love
You can't see your smile
Your eyes not the way that I do.
Don't ever feel worthless
Just know that you're perfect
And I'd change the world before
I change a thing about you.

Na na na na na na na na na

Some days you don't feel beautiful
Some days you wanna change it all.
Those are the things that caught my heart
I love you just the way you are.

But some day you wake up
And feel like you need love
You can't see your smile
Your eyes not the way that I do.
Don't ever feel worthless
Just know that you're perfect
And I'd change the world before
I change a thing about you.

But some day you wake up
And feel like you need love
You can't see your smile
Your eyes not the way that I do.
Don't ever feel worthless
Just know that you're perfect
And I'd change the world before
I change a thing about you.
