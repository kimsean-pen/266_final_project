Is there a place that we can go to teach the children not to grow?
Where lovers don't remember where they met and heartbreak is easy to forget?
Is there no love to speak of?

I'm looking for a new place to call home

There has to be a closer country where love can live near me
I've got to find it because I'm not seeing clearly
There is someone knocking on my door
No one lives here anymore

Don't I know you?
You've got to believe me
We met yesterday
Don't I know you?
I don't believe this bar is closing sir
Don't I know you? (I guess I never did)
