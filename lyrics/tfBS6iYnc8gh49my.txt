Can anybody help me?, I'm outta plans
Guess I left my world in somebody's hands
I don't like to hurt but, but everyone gets weak
Someone to rely on, it's what I really need

Now here we stay, it's all that we're worth
I've been through the pain and been dragged through the dirt
Whatever they tell you were bigger than words
I've been where you're standing, I know how it hurts

Let this be a song now and this be our day
We stand together
We'll be okay
'Cause we're survivors, we're making it work
Expecting the best when they hope for the worst

(One love)
This is the way we found
(One love)
Even though they'll let you down
(One love)
No, nobody's perfect now
(One love)
Don't let that hold you down
(One love)
Let's stick together now
(One love)
We got to stand our ground
(One love)
It's easy to believe in
One love
Believe in you and me
One love

Now I could try and fix this all by myself
But I know it'd turn out better if you help
No one likes to hurt but, but everyone gets weak
Someone to rely on, that's what everybody needs

Now here we stay, it's all that we're worth
I've been through the pain and been dragged through the dirt
Whatever they tell you were bigger than words
I've been where you're standing, I know how it hurts

Let this be a song now and this be our day
We stand together
We'll be okay
'Cause we're survivors, we're making it work
Expecting the best when they hope for the worst

(One love)
This is the way we found
(One love)
Even though they'll let you down
(One love)
Nobody's perfect now
(One love)
Don't let that hold you down
(One love)
Let's stick together now
(One love)
We got to stand our ground
(One love)
It's easy to believe in
One love
Believe in you and me
One love
It's one love
I'm here to tell you it's one love, oh
One love
Said it's one love
Sing with me, one love
One love to be
Oh, one love
That's all we need, one love
