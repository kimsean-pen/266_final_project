Nothing changes but the weather
You just think that you got better
Time doesn't heal, it scabs the wound
I won't cover, cover my scars for you

I won't cover my scars for you
(I won't cover my scars for you)

Victim of deceit
Weighed down by your heavy hand
A constant battle
Between who you want and who I am

I'll see you at the fucking cross roads
I'll make you bite through your tongue
When you see who I am today
I'll make you hate what you've done

Cover your tracks
Let revenge flood
You've made your mark
Blood will have blood

Idiot
Blood will have blood
