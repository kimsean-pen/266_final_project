By a black road
Giving a brief smile
Something's on the way
Forgotten for a while
And you try to speak this
Without a voice down by a black road
We try to forget and we try to make it through

Someday we'll go
Further from this right into the bliss
Some night we'll try
To leave this place for another

They keep pushing me
So far from every chance
Makes it so much harder
For me to carry on
So I try to speak this
Without a thought down by a black road
We try to forget and we try to make it through

Someday we'll go
Further from this right into the bliss
Some night we'll try
To leave this place for another
