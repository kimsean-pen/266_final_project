Whoa, go, go, go, aye-go, go, go
Aye-go, go, go, aye-go, go, go
Aye-go, go, go, aye-go, go, go, aye

I spend my money on the regular miracles
Just like you, like me, like everybody else
Up on the sun, lookin' sad and beautiful
Just like you, like me, like everybody else

When it gets loud, I turn it up
Oh, shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
When it's too hot, I light it up
Ooh, light it up, yeah, smoke 'em if you got 'em
(Aye-go, go, go, aye-go, go, go, aye)

Here come the jets, hide my money in your tube socks
Run like me, like hell, like everybody else
Hair metal on a Japanese boombox
Kicks like you, like me, like everybody else

When it gets loud, I turn it up
Oh, shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
When it's too hot, I light it up
Oh, light it up, yeah, smoke 'em if you got 'em
When it's too soft, I shake it up
Sh-sh-sh-shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
You're so sweet, but I like it rough
Ooh, light it up, yeah, smoke 'em if you got 'em

Aye-go, go, go, aye-go, go, go
Aye-go, go, go, aye-go, go, go
Aye-go, go, go, aye-go, go, go
Aye-go, go, go, aye-go, go, go, aye!

Makin' a movie on the couch with a flip phone
Just like you, like I, like fingers in your mouth
Up on the sun, playing drums with a bleached bone
Just like you, like me, like everybody else

When it gets loud, I turn it up
Oh, shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
When it's too hot, I light it up
Oh, light it up, yeah, smoke 'em if you got 'em
When it's too soft, I shake it up
Oh, like a little bad girl up in Harlem
You're so sweet, but I like it rough
Ooh, light it up, yeah, smoke 'em if you got 'em
