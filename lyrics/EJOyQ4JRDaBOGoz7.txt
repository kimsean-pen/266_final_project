Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
But when you needed me I came through
I paint a picture of the days gone by

when love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
so that I knew that you were there for me.
time after time your were there for me

Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand?
Love letters in the sand - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, to every endless day
I wanna hear you say I remember you
We spent the summer with the top rolled down, wished ever after would be like this.

you said I love ya babe with out a sound,
I said I'd give my life for just one kiss
live for your smile,
and die for your kiss.

Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand?
Love letters in the sand - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, to every endless day

I wanna hear you say I remember you

We've had our share of hard times
But that's the price we paid
And through it all we kept the promise that we made
I swear you'll never be lonely

We woke up to the sound of pouring rain,
washed away I dream of you
but nothing else could ever take you away
cuz you'll always be my dream come true
long as I live, I'll love you
Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand?
Love letters in the sand - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, to every endless day
I wanna hear you say I remember you
Remember yesterday
walking hand in hand
love letters in the sand
I remember you
through ask the sleepless nights.
through all the endless days
I wanna hear you say,
I remember you
I remember you
oh ya
