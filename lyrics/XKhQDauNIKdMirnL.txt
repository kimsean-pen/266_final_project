Oh, I could've left it on

Waiting for me after class

Making out behind the school

Mind if I come round
Need a place to calm down
Oh, I could've left it on
Yeah, I could've left it

Mind if I come round
Need a place to calm down
Oh, I could've left it on

Taking my breath from me one more time

Mind if I come round
Need a place to calm down
Oh, I could've left it on
Yeah, I could've left it

Mind if I come round
Need a place to calm down
Oh, I could've left it on
Yeah, I could've left it

Yeah, I could've left it

Yeah, I could've left
