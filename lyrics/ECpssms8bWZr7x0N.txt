I

Don't you lay your head, on my head
On my head, on my couch
I ain't got the time
Won't waste time on your insides and out

You say if I don't concern me
They'll sell my sexy worries
Bite your tongue hun, keep it to yourself
Don't you lay your head, on my head
On my head, on my couch

Bite your tongue hun, keep it to yourself
Bite your tongue hun, keep it to yourself
To yourself
I, I'd rather kill myself in a '71 Charger

Rolling back and forth, back and forth
Back and forth with your words
I ain't got the time
Won't waste time whilst you mess with my nerves

Your trouble isn't worthy
You're talking like it's dirty
Bite your tongue hun, keep it to yourself
Rolling back and forth, back and forth
Back and forth with your words

Bite your tongue hun, keep it to yourself
Bite your tongue hun, keep it to yourself
To yourself
I, I'd rather kill myself in a '71 Charger
Bite your tongue hun, keep it to yourself
Bite your tongue hun, keep it to yourself
To yourself
I, I'd rather kill myself in a '71 Charger

Yearning for the blank road, it's my complement
Craving the comfort from that empty seat
I ride on my own

Bite your tongue hun, keep it to yourself
Bite your tongue hun, keep it to yourself
To yourself
I, I'd rather kill myself in a '71 Charger
Bite your tongue hun, keep it to yourself
Bite your tongue hun, keep it to yourself
To yourself
I, I'd rather kill myself in a '71 Charger
