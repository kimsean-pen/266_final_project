You don't need a disclaimer
You're not really famous
So get your fucking chin outta the sky
I will never stop 'til I'm on top
create a new diversion
Virgins begging for a hit with original style

I don't need a disclaimer to get into heaven
I know I've made mistakes, I don't need to be saved.
Holyness is fucking televised
Fakers profiteering
Pioneer a new 'religion' stealing money 'for God'.

1-2-3-4
Crossed out
Wrists bound
Everybody get down
Come on and get me, come on and get me
Blacked out
Ghost town
Light it up and burn it down
You wanna blame me? You never met me
On your knees
Just a slave to a God of nothing
Try and judge me

I'll tie that rope around your neck and kick your throne out

Fuck you!
You don't need a disclaimer
You're not really famous
So get your fucking nose outta my life
Unprotected sex confession
Sharing needles at the altar

Father fucking little kids makes you holier than thou

Fuck you!

Almost every major issue I see that faces opposition in the world today is a product of religious bigotry or criminal intent in the name of God.
Who the fuck are you to tell me what I can and can't do or say?
No thanks. Fuck you.
It's my life, my body, and my love to give.
Dear ignorance, I'll see you in Hell.
There is no cure for the divine infection.
