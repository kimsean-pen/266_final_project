Yeah, whoa whoa
Yeah, whoa whoa
Haha
Yeah
My name is Scott Mescudi
Mmmmmmmmmmmm
Yeah

Gotta get it through my thick head
I was so close to bein' dead, yeah
Life, live it, nobody sell tips
Man, I'm just walkin' without bein' led
See the world is so crazy and filled with such risk
I just know I gotta dodge them
The beginnings are followed by an end
In the in-between time I'm not runnin' or hidin' in
See, things
Do
Come
Around
And make sense eventually
Things
Do
Come
Around
But some things trouble me

The people I met and the places I've been
All will make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?
I'm mostly confused about the world I live in
They think that I'm lonely, well I probably am
One thing that still gets me
When did I become a ghost? Yeah

Na-na-na na-na-na-na whoa whoa whoa haha yeah
Yeah yeah whoa-whoa Yo

Tried to fight it
And soon I gave in
Down a road with no lights on
Can't describe it, and you don't move like them

You've become their worst nightmare
You remember the things that your parents have said
You'd rather find out the hard way
You should tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend
I keep with my stroll, I'm not runnin' or hidin' in
See things
Do
Come
Around
And make sense eventually
Things
Do
Come
Around
And some things still trouble me

The people I met and the places I've been
All will make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?
I'm mostly confused about the world I live in
They think that I'm lonely, well I probably am
One thing that still gets me
When did I become a ghost? Yeah

Na-na-na na-na-na-na whoa whoa whoa haha yeah
Yeah yeah whoa-whoa Yo

Mmm-oohh
I hope they understand that I really understand that they don't understand
I hope they understand that I really understand that they don't understand
I really understand that they
I really think I um...
I hope they understand that I really understand that they don't understand... woah
Listen to me
Whoa-oa-oa
Listen to me
Whoa-oa-oa
