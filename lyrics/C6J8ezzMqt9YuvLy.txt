The sky turns to a different shade of blue
After the rain
My mind turns to a different point of view
After the rain

Oooh... my mind
Oooh... my mind
Oooh... my mind

I know...

Like the ocean needs the moon to take the tides away
All we need's a little time to chase the blues away
Sun is out and it feels like it's always gonna stay
Let this last forever
Turn tomorrow into yesterday

Now all those clouds have nothing left to do
After the rain
And all those doubts have drifted out of view
After the rain

Oooh... my mind
Oooh... my mind
Oooh... my mind

I know...

Like the ocean needs the moon to take the tides away
All we need's a little time to chase the blues away
Sun is out and it feels like it's always gonna stay
Let this last forever
Turn tomorrow into yesterday
Like the ocean needs the moon to take the tides away
All we need's a little time to chase the blues away
Sun is out and it feels like it's always gonna stay
Let this last forever
Turn tomorrow into yesterday
Into yesterday
