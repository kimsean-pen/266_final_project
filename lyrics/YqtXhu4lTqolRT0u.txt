Grief is a freight train, oh what's a little pain, when you've got so much to love
Greif is a freight train, oh what's a little pain, when you've got so much to love
Forever is a slow dream, oh what a vivid thing, when you've got so much to lose
Hope is a fast car, only takes you so far, when you've got a lot to lose

Close your eyes
Take to the sky like a big blue kite, leave your woes behind
Close my eyes
Try to remember what you said to me, before you said goodbye

Love is a slow song, playing on the radio, I know every word by heart
Happiness is soft light, that we see our lives by, only faded to the dark

Close your eyes
Take to the sky like a big blue kite, leave your woes behind
Close my eyes
Try to remember what you said to me, before you said goodbye
