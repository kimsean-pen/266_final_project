I see you wander so lost and alone
You falter on down the darkest of roads
Led astray for a way now, you're too far from home
No longer caring for wherever you may roam

This is the path to the end of it all
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
This is the darkness at the end of the world
It lingers on and on and on
Lingers on and on and on

You're going under, life's pulling you down
Life's making you choke, life's making you drown
Get a way to the pain now, consuming your soul
I see you fall, I see you lose all control

This is the path to the end of it all
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
This is the darkness at the end of the world
It lingers on and on and on
Lingers on and on and on

Drag you under...
This life will make you drown
Drag you under...
I can see you're going down
Drag you under...
This is the final curtain call
Drag you under...
This is the end of it all

This is the path to the end of it all
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
This is the darkness at the end of the world
It lingers on and on and on
Lingers on and on and on
