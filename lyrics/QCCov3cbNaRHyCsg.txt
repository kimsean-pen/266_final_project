Born into half of a body, desperate to be realigned.
8 limbs, 2 tongues, redefining false design.

Separation magnetizing a reunion of golden souls.
Reassembled at hip and mouth. Dispel your demons, welcome home.

Every day that you spent searching for the womb of your rebirth.
Preserving every sacred organ just to show her what she's worth.

Exhaling all of the darkness dissipates
Beauty personifies, dead dreams animate.

Defeated from the moment she came.

Now we're sound and safe, you're the one I'll follow.
Locked hands til our old age, and never letting go.

I'll bring you back to life. You're not alone.
Comfort in love is sheltered inside.
I keep reaching for a way out when the love is not enough.
I've been dancing in the dark for far too long.

My tongue is yet to tire from her first name.
Infinite desire, come for my last name.

Defeated from the moment she came.
Now we're sound.

I'll bring you back to life. You're not alone.
Comfort in love is sheltered inside.
I keep reaching for a way out when the love is not enough.
I've been dancing in the dark for far too long.
I've been hanging on a heart when I'm not strong.
I've been dancing in the dark for far too long.

All my love, can you feel it?

I'll bring you back to life. You're not alone.
Comfort in love is sheltered inside.
I keep reaching for a way out when the love is not enough.
I've been dancing in the dark for far too long.
I've been hanging on a heart when I'm not strong.
I've been dancing in the dark for far too long

Will you notice if I don't notice you
Familiar touch turns stranger
Will you notice if I don't notice you
