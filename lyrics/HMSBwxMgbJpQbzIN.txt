Devouring my children

The underlying reason for all violence
Is vitally it represents control
When darkness emerges I rather be dead
...disapproval of innocence
And the way your son will die without
name onto bring the world catastrophe

Embrace, embrace, embrace!

Slowly crawling towards this life's glory
To keep it I am
Devouring my children

To turn from recognizing, to shudder
In fear at yourself
...is weakness

Make glorious the embrace of Saturn

Other way your son will die to the
road onto bring the world catastrophy

Devour,devour,devour

Slowly crawling towards this life's glory
To keep it I am
Devouring my children
