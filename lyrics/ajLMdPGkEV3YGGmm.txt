Behind the curtain
Laid to ruins
Words that drift
Into oblivion
With every dawn
The world deforms
And as we fade
Our truth it dies
Our poetry of broken dreams
An abattoir of time
Deep in the hive of the serpent
We shed the disguises we have worn
A curtain of madmen
We are the illusions we have torn
Death and the labyrinth
Swallowed by earth itself
With every dawn
Of hunger and thirst
The world deforms
To a pale uncertain ash
Words without sound
Fade away as they are swallowed
Swallowed by barriers and walls
Like a swarm
Deep in the hive of the serpent
We shed the disguises we have worn
A curtain of madmen
We are the illusions we have torn
Our poetry of broken dreams
An abattoir of time
Death and the labyrinth
Swallowed by earth itself
