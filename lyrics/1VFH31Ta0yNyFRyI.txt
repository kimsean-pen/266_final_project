Time and distance blurs the image
So far removed from the life you're used to
Flood of '72 casting shadows over you
A giant's despair
I see the valley beneath me
Revealing what you still can't remember

Your best clothes hanging in the closet
A constant reminder
A town that's underwater
A giant's despair

Time and distance return to the surface
Resurface
