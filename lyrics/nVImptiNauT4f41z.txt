Falling into you, baby
Even Electricity can't compare to what I feel
When I'm with you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm see-through

You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you Electricity
Give it to you

And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know
I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know
I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

All I see is you, lately
Wide awake and in my dreams
I see your face so vividly
I don't know what I'd do
Ooh, baby
If you only saw a friend in me
I'd be bittersweet

You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you Electricity
Give it to you

And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know
I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know
I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

I feel Electric, baby
So Electric, baby
Wanna let you know, let you know, ooh
I think I'm ready, baby
I think I'm ready, now
Electricity, I'm falling in to you

(I want it, I need it)
I feel Electric, baby (This current between us)
So Electric baby (This flow, this feeling tonight)
Wanna let you know, let you know
(I want it, I need it)
I think I'm ready, baby (This current between us)
I think I'm ready, now (This flow, this feeling tonight)
Electricity, I'm falling in to you

Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know
I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know
I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

I feel Electric, baby
So Electric, baby
Wanna let you know, let you know
(I want it, I need it)
I think I'm ready, baby (This current between us)
I think I'm ready, now (This flow, this feeling)
Electricity (Woohoo)

So Electric, baby
Wanna let you know, let you know
I think I'm ready, baby
I think I'm ready, now
