I bet you get this right
I think you said enough
Where did she get the stones to act so tough

Say your name so they can hear you
I bet she wants to see
I heard the way they talk about you
Don't be confusing me

They still don't seem to mind
I heard it's split the night
We waste our time
They think they earned the right

Raise your hands so they can see you
I bet they want to know
I heard our friends are coming after for you
Their signs will till your soul

Say your name so they can hear you
I bet she wants to see
I heard the way they talk about you
Don't be confusing me
