I'm a rider, and I'm gonna ride
Gonna make myself a spirit of the night
I am a loser, I've already lost
So which God is the truth, and which is false?

You think that I was born to be
A tender rose beneath an oak tree
But I never loved roses
I think I should let myself breathe
I think I should leave myself be
To sleep and dream at the end of the day

I was talking in my sleep
I was talking to me
I said you're a coward
She said cowards are weak

There was blood between my eyes
I did not know
You wiped it away
I said let my wounds show

You think that I was born to be
A gentle breeze above the dead sea
But I wanna be oceans
I think I should let myself breathe
I think I should leave myself be
To sleep in peace at the end of the day
