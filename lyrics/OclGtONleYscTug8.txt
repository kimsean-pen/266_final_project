Walk into the heart of danger

Tear down the walls and crash the gates
Don't run away from yourself
You're on a brave new journey now

Clench your fist and put a grin on your face
Just let go and you'll never be the same

Walk into the heart of danger
And don't let the darkness enchain you
Walk into the heart of danger
Face your fear

You are the roar of a lion
You are the raging storm
Passion and pain, lost love
Finding the will for victory

One with the heroes who dwell in your soul
You get stronger every time you fall

Walk into the heart of danger
And don't let the darkness enchain you
Walk into the heart of danger
Face your fear

It's not okay for others to decide
Who you should be and how to live your life

Walk into the heart of danger
And don't let the darkness enchain you
Walk into the heart of danger
Face your fear

Walk into the heart of danger
And don't let the darkness enchain you
Walk into the heart of danger
Face your fear, oh
Face your fear, oh
Face your fear, oh
Face your fear
