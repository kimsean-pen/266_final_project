knowing your voice could awaken me - is what makes my life impossible
knowing we've severed every tie - yet remain bound to each other
knowing how i long for the one i once loved - the one who once loved me
knowing what i've lost - what is it like to have that beyond reach?

knowing that your voice will destroy any new dreams i create.
knowing i'll do the things that you desire.
life moves on. lie in wait. unaffected. unconscious.
knowing that your voice will destroy any new dreams i believe in.

a chaos of desire
knowing i love you...
there's no longer, anything i can do
there's no longer, anything i can do about it.
