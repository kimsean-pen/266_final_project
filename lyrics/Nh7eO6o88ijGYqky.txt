Let's pretend that we'll be here tomorrow
And I'll try for you to be a little more on time
I know you need to say you know you've let me down
But you haven't and it's hard to talk with people all around
Please don't say how proud you are

Let's do the things we normally do
I'll say see you later you'll sing a line or two
From your rebel songs sung out of tune
Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to

Let's forget that we're here and make some plans
We'll go for walks sit together on the bench we always sat
I'll tell you every little detail of my day and so will you
But don't try to stay awake, I'm feeling tired too
This is just another day

Let's do the things we normally do
I'll say see you later you'll sing a line or two
From your rebel songs sung out of tune
Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to

Armoured cars and tanks and guns
Came to take away our sons
Every body stood behind the men behind the wire
There's a fight to love, a fight to have
Your bed's a battlefield and back
But all of this will just be stripped away

Let's do the things we normally do
I'll say see you later you'll sing a line or two
From your rebel songs sung out of tune
Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to

Don't look me in the eye more than you need to
Don't try to say goodbye if I don't want to

Don't say how proud you are
And say and fall away
And take all your need
And say a word and die and sing
And fade away and let our soul
became and sail away
...along the way
