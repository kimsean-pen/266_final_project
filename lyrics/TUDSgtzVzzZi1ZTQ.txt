Marcus Garvey words come to pass
Marcus Garvey words come to pass

Can't get no food to eat
Can't get no money to spend, whoa
Can't get no food to eat, mm
Can't get no money to spend, whoa

Come, little one and let me do what I can do for you
And you and you alone
Come, little one, come whoa
Let me do what I can, mm

For you and you alone, whoa
He who knows the right and do it not
Shall be spanked with many stripes

Weeping and wailing and moaning
You've got yourself to blame, I tell you
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right

I beg you, whoa
Tell you to do right, mm
Beg you to do right, whoa

Where is Bagawire? He's nowhere around
He can't be found
First betrayer who gave away Marcus Garvey
Son of Satan, first prophecy

Catch them, Garvey, oh
Hold them Marcus, hold them, mm
Prophecy fulfilled, oh

Catch them Garvey, catch them, mm
Hold them Marcus, hold them, whoa
Marcus Garvey, Marcus, mm
