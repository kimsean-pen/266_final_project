Born free
As free as the wind blows
As free as the grass grows
Born free to follow your heart

Live free
And beauty surrounds you
The world still astounds you
each time you look at a star

Stay free
Where no walls divide you
You're free as a roaring tide so there's no need to hide

Born free
And life is worth living
But only worth living
Cos you're born free

Instrumental

Stay free
Where no walls divide you
You're free as a roaring tide so there's no need to hide
Born free
And life is worth living
But only worth living
Cos you're born free
