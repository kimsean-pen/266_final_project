Drifting into the lives
Seep into the soul
Where emotions hide

Dark skies were beating me down with shadows
Of deceit, slashing at trust till it forever bleeds
With doubts, with pain, with trust, is pain

When you think of me, in your multidimensional mind
Try and wash the evil from your mind and open it

When you taste the truth you will see like others
Before me to you, I am past a story to tell to you
I am past a story to tell, tell it

If you think you own the end
Take another look at the script of sadness
Etched in the book

Dark skies were beating me down with shadows
Of deceit, slashing at trust till it forever bleeds
With doubts, with pain, with trust, is pain

When you think of me, in your multidimensional mind
Try and wash the evil from your mind and open it

When you taste the truth you will see like others
Before me to you, I am past a story to tell to you
I am past a story to tell, tell it
