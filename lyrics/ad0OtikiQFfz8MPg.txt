Must be something in the water
Feel like I can take the world
Throw the weight up on my shoulders
Cause I won't even feel the burn

Don't be afraid to dive
Be afraid that you didn't try
These moments remind us why
We're here, we're so alive

Let's live like we're immortal
Live just for tonight
We'll think about tomorrow, yeah
When the sun comes up
Cause by this time tomorrow
We'll be talking about tonight
Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
No more wasted nights

ただ過ぎゆく時間に気を留める必要はない
何かを失えば、また何か手にする
Don't be afraid to dive
何もせずはもっと怖い
These moments remind us why
ここで生きる意味を

Let's live like we're immortal
Live just for tonight
We'll think about tomorrow, yeah
When the sun comes up
Cause by this time tomorrow
We'll be talking about tonight
Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
No more wasted nights

I don't wanna wait, I don't want to waste a night
I don't wanna wait, I don't want to waste a night
I don't wanna wait, I don't want to waste a night
I don't wanna wait, I don't want to waste a night

Let's live like we're immortal
Live just for tonight
We'll think about tomorrow, yeah
When the sun comes up
Cause by this time tomorrow
We'll be talking about tonight
Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
No more wasted nights

I don't wanna wait, I don't want to waste a night
I don't wanna wait
No more wasted nights
