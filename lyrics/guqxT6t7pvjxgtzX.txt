Ever had a thought about us?
I can't lie, you cross my mind
But I avoid it every time
And I wasn't thinkin' 'bout love
But I got to tell you now
I've had this feeling for a while

Caught up in a moment
I don't know how to feel
Do you want this love of mine?
Is this something real?
I don't know if it's wrong or right
But this is how I feel
But I just can't make up my mind
I'm losing it, losing it, yeah

It's killing me inside
Because the thought's stuck in my mind
And girl I hate to let you go
Oh yeah I hate to let you go
It's killing me inside
Because it used to feel so right
But now I hate to let you go
Oh yeah I hate to let you go

I hate to ruin something so good
But can't help it, how I feel
I can't let it be concealed
And I thought about staying quiet
But you deserve to know the truth
It's the least that I can do

Caught up in a moment
I don't know how to feel
Do you want this love of mine?
Is this something real?
I don't know if it's wrong or right
But this is how I feel
But I just can't make up my mind
I'm losing it, losing it, yeah

It's killing me inside
Because the thought's stuck in my mind
And girl I hate to let you go
Oh yeah I hate to let you go
It's killing me inside
Because it used to feel so right
But now I hate to let you go
Oh yeah I hate to let you go

I realize what I put on the line
It's so hard to say goodbye
And how many times I tried to clear up my mind
It's so hard to say goodbye

Caught up in a moment
I don't know how to feel (I don't know how to feel)
Do you want this love of mine? (tell me, do you want it)
Is this something real?
I don't know if it's wrong or right (I don't know)
And this is how I feel
But I just can't make up my mind
I'm losing it, losing it, yeah

It's killing me inside
Because the thought's stuck in my mind
And girl I hate to let you go
Oh yeah I hate to let you go
It's killing me inside (killing me)
Because it used to feel so right
But now I hate to let you go
Oh yeah I hate to let you go
It's killing me (killing me inside baby)
Hate to let you go (no, no, no, no)
Hate to let you go (eh, eh, eh, eh)
It's killing me inside, baby (killing me inside)
I don't wanna let you go, no, no, no, no, no
Hate to let you go
Hate to let you go, baby
