I tried to keep an open mind
I feel like I'm under attack all of the time
I'm compromised
My head can't always hold itself so high

What if inside, I'm dying?
Every night I'm crying
And even if I die trying
I bet you'd probably quite like it

Yeah, I am a bad mother
I am a bad wife
You saw it on the socials
You read it online

If you go on record saying that you know me
Then why am I so lonely
'Cause nobody fucking phones me

You say, you see how I move
Tell me then, then
Tell me then, then
Don't act like you've been here too
Think again-gain
Think again-gain
I think you are being rude

Come on then, then
Come on then, then
Come on then
Come on then
Come on then

Come on then, then
Come on then, then
Come on then, then
Come on then, then

Since you know so much about me
Put your money where your mouth is
You should really hush your mouth
And keep your distance if you see me when you're out

Won't forgive you twice
I'll tell you all about your miserable life
Don't see me telling you what to do
Why do you scrutinize my every move?
And what exactly are you trying to prove?
When what you say's so far away from the truth

Yeah, I am a bad mother
I am a bad wife
You saw it on the socials
You read it online
If you go on record saying that you know me
Then why am I so lonely
'Cause nobody fucking phones me

Yeah, I am a bad mother
I am a bad wife
You saw it on the socials
You read it online
If you go on record saying that you know me
Then why am I so lonely
'Cause nobody fucking phones me

You say, you see how I move
Tell me then, then
Tell me then, then
Don't act like you've been here too
Think again-gain
Think again-gain
I think you are being rude

Come on then, then
Come on then, then
Come on then
Come on then
Come on then

Come on then, then
Come on then, then
Come on then, then
Come on then, then

Since you know so much about me
Put your money where your mouth is
