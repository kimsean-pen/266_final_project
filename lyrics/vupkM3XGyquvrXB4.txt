So blue
And violently calmed
I drowned
But yet i feel so fine
And some how
Some how
Some how
Don't know why
I love it down here

¡Eh!
Sale el sol
Y aunque ahogado veo el resplandor
¡Eh!
Ya me fui
Mas sigo en el fondo

I thought you did
But you don't know me
But you don't know me
But you don't know me
But you don't know me
But you don't know me

¡Eh!
Sale el sol
Y aunque ahogado veo el resplandor
¡Eh!
No cambio
Mas sigo en el fondo

I thought you did
But you don't know me
But you don't know me
But you don't know me.
