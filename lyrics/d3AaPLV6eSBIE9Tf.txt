You talk too much
Maybe that's your way
Of breaking up the silence
That fills you up
But it doesn't sound the same
When no one's really listening

We stumble
Into our lives
Reach for a hand to hold
Any wonder
We need to find
A certain something certain

Turn out the light
And what are you left with
Open up my hands
And find out they're empty
Press my face to the ground
I've gotta find a reason
Just scratching around
For something to believe in
Something to believe in

You have too much
Spending all your time
Collecting and discovering
It's not enough
And no matter how you try
You never find the one you want

We stumble into our lives
Without a hand to hold
Any wonder
We need to find
A certain something certain

Turn out the light
And what are you left with
Open up my hands
And find out they're empty
Press my face to the ground
I'm gonna find a reason
Still scratching around
For something to believe in
Something to believe in

Something I can believe in
Something I can believe in
Come on I need it
Something I can believe in now
Come on I need it
Something I can believe in
Come on I need it, oh

Something I can believe in
Come on I need it
Oh, oh

Right on, right now
Right on, right now
I just need something to believe in

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
