January sleeping standing up
Februrary literally discussed it
March is April's manic baby's name
May i had forgot what i was saying
June in the jacket with her hands on the back of it

The people on the left are not impressed
And the people on the right identity crisis
All of a sudden i can't remember nothing
But she said the look on my face was insane

I'm fully with the sustain
Like the princess's brain
Not to be confused in the shade
But ain't that one and the same
I'm fully with the sustain

July, all the screws are missing
In August we had married our immune systems
September whored October's applications
November brang infatuations
December in bed taking it to the head

The people on the left are not impressed
And the people on the right identity crisis
All of a sudden i can't remember nothing
But she said the look on my face was insane
And that March was April's manic baby's name
And how could I forget what I'd been saying

I'm fully with the sustain
Like the princess's brain
Not to be confused in the shade
But ain't that one and the same?
I'm fully with the sustain

Its still the same year in my dream last night (don't call it off)
I still need you to get babe-afied (don't call it off)
Love at first duh all over the mouth (don't call it off)
It fails within or it fails without (don't call it off)

I'm fully with the sustain
Like the princess's brain
Not to be confused in the shade
But ain't that one and the same?
I'm fully with the sustain
