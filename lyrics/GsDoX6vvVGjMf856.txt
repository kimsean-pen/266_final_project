All we ate today was cake
I pray the lord our teeth to break

Running off like mocker's jaw
With blocks that beg to get knocked off

Eight ball or apple to bite
As snatchers cast them to the night

Moon barks at the dog tonight
Young tongue set on fire
Moon barks at the dog tonight
Weep with me in 4/4 time

Darkness on the edge of town
Is swimming in stereo sound

Boss is not my cup of tea
Averse to such authority

One, one, one
One cup of hemlock on the rocks
One, one, one
One cup of hemlock coming up

Moon barks at the dog tonight
Young tongue set on fire
Moon barks at the dog tonight
Weep with me in 4/4 time

Moon barks at the dog tonight
Young tongue set on fire
Moon barks at the dog tonight
Weep with me in 4/4 time

Weep with me in 4/4 time
Weep with me in 4/4 time
