I remember round' Autumn time
I smell the breeze. I feel the sun
Old memories come back to me
The way we used to dance
The way you clapped your hands
And I remember the smell of guns
War lived in me but love finally won
I've been delayed I've been denied
And then you came around and took the crown

We were unbreakable
We were like Rock n' Roll
We were like a king and queen
I want you to know
No matter how the story's told
We were like rock n' roll
We were like a king and queen
I want you to know

I remember our time alone
Wanting to dance locked in your arms
Your melody stays haunting me
We were twenty one and thought we owned the sun
And I remember our plan to run
My rebel ways and your utter nonsense
We'd go insane but it felt so fun
And now your queen is home to take your throne

We were unbreakable
We were like Rock n' Roll
We were like a king and queen
I want you to know
No matter how the story's told
We were like rock n' roll
We were unbreakable
I want you to know

Now help me say it's alright (It's alright! It's alright!)
You help me say it's alright (It's alright! It's alright!)
Say it's alright (It's alright! It's alright!)
Alright (It's alright! It's alright!)
Say it's alright (It's alright! It's alright!)
Now help me say it's alright (It's alright! It's alright!)
Ooh alright Uh-huh (It's alright! It's alright!)
Say it's alright alright, alright (It's alright! It's alright!)
Kellindo help me sing it louder!

So what are you gonna do? (I wanna be your rock n' roll)
Down in Mexico (you were just my rock n' roll)
Off in Paris, France (we taught poets how to dance)
Back to Tokyo (remember saki in Japan)
When Jamaica got way too cold (and your kisses warmed the sand)
And every time I think of you (I wanna be your rock n' roll)
So What are you gonna do? (so what are you gonna do?)
Cause I remember you (because I remember you)

Keep marching on we will love when the time is right
