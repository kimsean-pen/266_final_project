Though you may not drive a great big Cadillac
Gangsta whitewalls, TV antennas in the back
You may not have a car at all
But remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall

Just be thankful for what you've got
Though you may not drive a great big Cadillac
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean

Gangsta whitewalls, TV antennas in the back
You may not have a car at all
But remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful for what you've got

Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin the scene with a gangsta lean, wooh ooh ooh
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin the scene with a gangsta lean, wooh ooh ooh
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean, wooh ooh ooh

Though you may not drive a great big Cadillac
Gangsta whitewalls TV antennas in the back
