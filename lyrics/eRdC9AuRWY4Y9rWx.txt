Well, come on let's go
Let's go, let's go, little darlin'
And tell me that you're never leaving
Come on, come on, let's go, ah
Again, again and again

Well, now
Swing me, swing me
All the way down there
Come on let's go, little darlin'
Let's go, let's go again once more

Well
I love you so, dear
And I'll never let you go
Come on, baby, so
Oh pretty baby, I-I love you so

Let's go, let's go, let's go
Little sweetheart
Then we can always be together
Come on, come on
Let's go again

I love you so, dear
And I'll never let you go
Come on, baby, so
Oh pretty baby, I-I love you so

Let's go, let's go, let's go
Little darlin'
They're dancing and we belong here
Come on, come on, let's go, ah
Again, again and again and again
Again, again and again and again
Again, again and again and again
Again, again and again and again
