When I was a little boy (When I was just a boy)
And the devil would call my name (When I was just a boy)
I'd say, now who do (Who)
Who do you think you're foolin' (When I was just a boy)
I'm a consecrated boy (When I was just a boy)
I'm a singer in a Sunday choir
Oh, my mama loves me, she loves me
She get down on her knees and hug me
Like she loves me like a rock
She rocks me like the rock of ages and loves me
She love me, love me, love me, love me
When I was grown to be a man (Grown to be a man)
And the devil would call my name (Grown to be a man)
I'd say, now who do (Who)
Who do you think you're foolin' (Grown to be a man)
I'm a consummated man (Grown to be a man)
I can snatch a little purity
My mama loves me, she loves me
She get down on her knees and hug me
Like she loves me like a rock
She rocks me like the rock of ages and loves me
She love me, love me, love me, love me
And if I was President (Was the President)
The minute congress call my name (Was the President)
I'd say now, who do (who)
Who do you think you're foolin' (Who do you think you're foolin')
I've got the Presidential seal (Was the President)
I'm up on the Presidential podium
My mama loves me, she loves me
She get down on her knees and hug me
Like she loves me like a rock
She rock me like the rock of ages and loves me
She love me, love me, love me, love me (Loves me like a rock)
She love me, love me, love me, love me (Loves me like a rock)
She love me, love me, love me, love me (Loves me like a rock)
Oh yeah (Loves me like a rock)
Nanananana (Rock me like the rock of ages)
(Loves me like a rock)
(Loves me like a rock)
(Rock me like the rock of ages)
(Loves me like a rock)
(Loves me like a rock)
Nanananana (Rock me like the rock of ages)
(Loves me like a rock)
(Loves me like a rock)
(Rock me like the rock of ages)
(Loves me like a rock)
(Loves me like a rock)
(Rock me like the rock of ages)
(Loves me like a rock)
(Loves me like a rock)
(Rock me like the rock of ages)
