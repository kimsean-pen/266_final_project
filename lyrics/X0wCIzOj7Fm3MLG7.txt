Laughing we swim, down the river
Floating we live, bound together

And everyone's a loser baby that's true
Everyone's a loser baby that's true
Me and you

Walk fast the road, long and winding
Breaking the code, the future's hiding

And everyone's a loser baby that's true
Everyone's a loser baby that's true
Me and you

[4x]
(At the end of the spring,
There's a beautiful thing.)

Trying to fly, away from the shadows
High as a kite, and over the rainbow

And everyone's a loser baby that's true
Everyone's a loser baby that's true
Me and you

(At the end of the spring,
There's a beautiful thing
At the end of the spring)
