I had a little look for a minute today
and I told here there was something that I wanted to say.
Just sitting there glowing, with her red light on,
so I gotta move fast and it shouldn't take long.
Maybe she will? Maybe she won't?
You get yourself together cause she doesn't say don't.
I never ever thought I was looking for a wife
but I think I can love her for the rest of my life.
I only took one cause I couldn't take two.
I want to make love and it's gotta be you.
Every little thing that I ever tried to say
is coming out right in my own kind of way.
Take it, make it, the weather feels fine.
She must be Lady Luck and she's gonna be mine.
I never ever thought I was looking for a wife
but I think I can love her for the rest of my life.
I will love you all my life.
