And though she's moving slow, back into place
All I wanna do is to make you stop and love me

O-o-oo-ou-hu-huu
O-o-oo-o

O-o-o-Okay
I love you, love you, I do
I need you, need you, I do
I love you, love, I do
I need you, need
I love you, love you, I do
I need you, you
I love you, love, I do
I need you, ooh
