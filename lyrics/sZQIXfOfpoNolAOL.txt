I've got my head, but my head is unraveling
Can't keep control; can't keep track of where it's traveling
I've got my heart, but my heart is no good
And you're the only one that's understood

I come along, but I don't know where you're taking me
I shouldn't go, but you're wrenching, dragging, shaking me
Turn off the sun; pull the stars from the sky
The more I give to you, the more I die

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you

You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug
You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug

You make me hard when I'm all soft inside
I see the truth when I'm all stupid-eyed
The arrow goes straight through my heart
Without you everything just falls apart

My blood, it wants to say hello to you
My fears, they want to get inside of you
My soul, it's so afraid to realize
How very little there is left of me

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you

You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug
You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug

You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug
You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug

You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug
You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug

You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug
You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug

You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug

Take me with you
Take me with you
Take me with you
Take me with you

(Take me with you)
Without you, without you everything falls apart
(Take me with you)
Without you, it's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
(Take me with you)
Without you, without you everything falls apart
(Take me with you)
Without you, it's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
(Take me with you)
It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
(Take me with you)
It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
Without you, without you everything falls apart
Without you, it's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
