I come home in the morning light.
My mother says
"When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones

The phone rings in the middle of the night,
My father yells,
"What cha ya gonna do with your life?"

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world.
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
When the working day is done
When the working day is done
