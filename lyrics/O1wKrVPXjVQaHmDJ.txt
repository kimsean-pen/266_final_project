Lacing my shoes
In the standard bar way
Nothing left loose
Gone are the days

In the heat of the night
The girls walk in twos
Drawn to the light
And too polite to refuse
Refuse

Spilling my blood
On the steps of my church
Where I knelt as a kid
By the old pulpit
But it don't seem to hurt

John, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
We're at war again!
And I've been stuck on the roadside
For old times sake with a terrible friend

But if you can play
Then you're part of the game

Love in suburbia, love in suburbia
Love in suburbia, love in suburbia
Love in suburbia, love in suburbia
Love in suburbia
We should all just go home
(Love in suburbia)

The kids don't care
'Cause they're too young to die
Too old to moan for it
Too young to vote for it
Too old to cry

God, is it always like this?
Is it always so grim?
Is it only the beautiful
Only the suitably damned who fit in?

But if you can play
Then your part of the game

Love in suburbia, love in suburbia
Love in suburbia, love in suburbia
Love in suburbia, love in suburbia
Love in suburbia, love in suburbia

Love in suburbia, love in suburbia
Love in suburbia, love in suburbia
Love in suburbia, love in suburbia
Love in suburbia, love in suburbia

Love in suburbia, in suburbia
In suburbia, in suburbia
Love in suburbia, in suburbia
In suburbia
