Throw my body out to sea
Or keep me here and cope with me
Now one of these days I'll push too far
I put my faith in the dopamine
Though I see you strugglin' too
[?] cut the fuse
So drink until your heart is full
Tell me what you want my hands to do
Tell me what you want my hands to do

But you get so stone, cold
And you know it's gonna cut me
To my bones, stone cold to me
And I'm in your choke, hold
And I'm trying to get through
But you feel, stone cold to me

Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo...

Is it you or is it me
Or is this how it's supposed to be
I think I'm getting too close to see
Tell me where you want my hands to be
Tell me where you want my hands to be

But you get so stone, cold
And you know it's gonna cut me
To my bones, stone cold to me
And I'm in your choke, hold
And I'm trying to get through
But you're still, stone cold to me
Yeah, you get so...

I feel like I'm falling
I wanna be moaning
Tell me what you want my hands to do

And I know I've been falling pray to your pleasure
And I let you consume all my love without pleasure
But I ain't even matter to you though
I let you feel my gratitude though, you know
I ain't too proud to go down and surrender
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You get so stone, cold
And you know it's gonna cut me
To my bones, stone cold to me
And I'm in your choke, hold
And I'm trying to get through
But you feel, stone cold to me

I feel like I'm falling
I wanna be moaning
Close to me
Tell me what you want my hands to do
I feel like I'm falling
But I keep on coming back to you
Tell me what you want my hands to do
