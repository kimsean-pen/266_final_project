Shut the light, call the night, bring my safety back
Are they gone, I hear none, as all fades to black
But your hands on my shoulder's calming me down

Build a wall, start a war, here they come for me
Grab the sword, come on board, face my enemy
But you silence all their cries when you speak your loving words

Be my sunrise
Redemption lies in your eyes

You are my antidote
When the waves of doubts rush in
As I drown in my memories
The darkness creeps in

Losing faith on my battleground
The shadows leave their mark
Your light brings me back from
The deep and the dark

Take my hand, make a stand, and then hold your breath
See what comes, see what runs, in the face of death
How is it that you never seem to worry?

In the end, I must bend, and then hold or break
Kneel to pray, come what may, when my soul's at stake
And you loosen all the knots with a smile on your face

In this rat race
The enemy wears my face

You are my antidote
When the waves of doubts rush in
As I drown in my memories
The darkness creeps in

Losing faith on my battleground
The shadows leave their mark
Your light brings me back from
The deep and the dark

Come take my hand, take my heart
Keep me safe, keep me warm
They take my pride, take this life
But they won't take my soul!

You are my antidote
When the waves of doubts rush in
As I drown in my memories
The darkness creeps in

Losing faith when I look around
Madness leaves a mark
Brings death to your doorway
The deep and the dark
