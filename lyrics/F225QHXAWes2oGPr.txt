I don't know where I can go
I hold my head too low
Lost my drive and lost my hope
My dreams are fading slow
I don't know where we go
I been very far from home, my heart
I don't know where we go I've been far from home, my god
I don't know where we go
I've been very far from home, my heart
I don't know where we go
I've been far from home, my heart
I swear that Imma die in the next week
So many fucking thoughts and now my neck's weak
I try find my heart and hear the next beat

But my soul is slowly burning from this red heat
Oh its on fire, I'm standing in the rye
Gonna take another lighter and burn until I die

Cause I can't even feel no more
I'm drowning,
somehow burning on this ocean floor and I miss when it was open door
You gave me everything but now we in a war

My path was clear but now its only faded
And I'm the only hated, relationship is raided
My path was clear but now its only faded
I'm the only hated, relationship is raided
My path was clear but now its only faded
I'm the only hated, relationship is

I don't know where I can go
I hold my head too low
Lost my drive and lost my hope
My dreams are fading slow

I don't know where we go
I've been very far from home, my heart
I don't know where we go
I've been far from home, my god

I don't know where we go
I've very far from home, my heart
I don't know where we go
I've been far from home, my heart
My life is going in the right direction
You told me if I stopped then our connection
Was dead, now I've never been surrounded

By these thoughts that tell me I ain't never found it
That's love, now its dead now, lose my fucking head now
Keep my eyes and head down
All I see is red now

Never thought that I would loss you
I looked up to you, and I swear that I knew you
But now I lost my freaking man
And my thoughts don't understand
That you hate me a man

So now where do I go
You gave us all a home
But now I'm all alone
So now where do I go
You gave us all a home
And now I'm all alone
I don't know where I can go
I hold my head too low
Lost my drive and lost my hope
My dreams are fading slow

I don't know where we go
I been very far from home, my heart
I don't know where we go
I've been far from home, my god

I don't know where we go
I've very far from home, my heart
I don't know where we go
I've been far from home, my heart
