Become! Become!

We've cut in, cut out
The face of man
Cut in, cut out
The face of...

Time has given us no reason to live
Look to the future and you will see nothing

What will become?
What will we be?
When we can see our own eternity x2

We've lost hope, lost fate
We've lost our way
Lost time, lost grace
We search for...

Man has taken time from all that you see
Look in his eye, see the future hold nothing

What will become?
What will we be?
When we can see our own eternityx2

Eternity!

What will become?
What will we be?
When we can change our own eternity

Man has taken time from all that you see
Look in his eye and you still will not see
No! You will not see! x4
No! You will not...

What will become?
What will we be?
When we can see our own eternity x2

What will become! x3
What will become of us
