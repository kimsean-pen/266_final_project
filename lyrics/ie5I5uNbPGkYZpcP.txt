Let the river run
let all the dreamers wake the nation
Come, the New Jerusalem.
Silver cities rise

the morning lights the streets that lead them
and sirens call them on with a song
It's asking for the taking

trembling
shaking
Oh, my heart is aching

We're coming to the edge
running on the water
coming through the fog
your sons and daughters

We the great and small
stand on a star
and blaze a trail of desire
through the darkening dawn

It's asking for the taking
Come run with me now
the sky is the colour of blue
you've never even seen

in the eyes of your lover
Oh, my heart is aching
We're coming to the edge
running on the water
coming through the fog

your sons and daughters
It's asking for the taking
trembling, shaking
Oh, my heart is aching
We're coming to the edge
running on the water
coming through the fog
your sons and daughters
Let the river run
let all the dreamers
wake the nation
Come, the New Jerusalem
