For this I was chosen, because I fear nothing
With confidence I tread through the dead of the night
Off to another war-torn, faraway battlefield
Wherein lies a daemonic enemy horde

On this day, I decide to anoint my fists
Engaging them in the mode of power and war
Stopping at nothing that's short of fulfilling my destiny
Willing to die and I will after you for what I believe

A desperate avenger striking fear in their hearts
Invading their dreams before the day even starts

Whet with your blood, I sharpen my sword
No turning the other cheek like a coward
Come tomorrow I may lay down and die
But not this day

Sent on an unholy quest
To reduce all those who resist
To the size of their shriveled up souls
And scatter them like grist

I vanquished the strangleholds that the netherworld sets for me
The last request of my life is to die killing my enemies

Bathed in blood up to the horses' bridle
It's death to retreat, there's no chance of survival

Whet with your blood, I sharpen my sword
No turning the other cheek like a coward
Come tomorrow I may lay down and die
But not this day

This day we fight!
This day we fight!
This day we fight!

Strip the fallen heroes
Finish off the wounded
Collect the spoils of war and send them back dead

This day we fight!
This day we fight!

Fight, fight
This day we fight - Fight, fight
Fight, fight
This day I fight!
