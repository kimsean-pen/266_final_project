On this rock
I will build my church
On this rock
I will build my church
On this rock
I will build my church
On this rock
I will kill my hurt

I!
I!

I hear the thunder calling
The law is carved in stone
All hopes and dreams in ardor
Nailed to a golden throne
My feet are sore and burning
I'm coming from afar
A million years divided
But still we're made of stars

We are still waiting
While we're all fading
We are destroying
What we're creating
Oh-oh
On this rock!

On this rock
I will build my church
On this rock
I will kill my hurt

Through all these years of crawling
I've grown an iron heart
Through all these times of falling
I've made rebirth my art
Here in this my own shelter
I've born each heavy stone
Compound the missing pieces
It's done
I am home!

We are still waiting
While we're all fading
We are destroying
What we're creating
Oh-oh
On this rock!

On this rock
I will build my church
On this rock
I will kill my hurt

We are still waiting
While we're all fading
We are destroying
What we're creating
Oh-oh
On this rock!

On this rock
I will build my church
On this rock
I will kill my hurt

On this rock (We are still waiting)
I will build my church (While we're all fading!)
On this rock
I will kill my hurt
On this rock
(We are destroying)
I will build my church
On this rock
I will kill my hurt
On this rock!
