You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love

Here's how it goes, you and me
Up and down but maybe this time
We'll get it right, worth the fight
'Cause love is something you can't shake
When it breaks all it takes is some tryin'

If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay
But soon you'll be finding
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

So if you go you should know
It's hard to just forget the past
So fast, it was good
It was bad but it was real and that's
All you have in the end - our love mattered

If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay
But soon you'll be finding
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

Here's how it goes
All it takes is some tryin'

If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay
But soon you'll be finding
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay
But soon you'll be finding
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

You can run
You can run
You can run
You can run

Baby, you can run, baby you can hide
But you can't escape my love
Baby you can run, baby you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can run
But you can't escape my love
You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love
