Some days I'll admit, I was difficult
Everything that you did, I was critical
You're holding the car keys
I'm saying, Don't tease me
If you're leaving, just leave me

Baby, we were good, we were almost perfect
I'd say it's your fault but you don't deserve it
You won't get back what we had with no one
Baby, we were good, it was almost worth it
We were almost
Almost, almost

So real, sometimes it was fictional, yeah
So good, sometimes it was criminal
So happy without me, or are you just acting?
Either way is right

Baby, we were good, we were almost perfect
I'd say it's your fault but you don't deserve it
You won't get back what we had with no one
Baby, we were good, it was almost worth it
We were almost
Almost, almost
Almost, almost
Almost
Baby, we were good, we were almost perfect
I'd say it's your fault but you don't deserve it
You won't get back what we had with no one
Baby, we were good, it was almost worth it
We were almost
Almost, almost
Almost, almost
Almost
