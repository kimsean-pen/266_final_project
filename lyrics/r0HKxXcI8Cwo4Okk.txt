Your love alone
Is not enough, not enough, not enough
When times get tough
They get tough, they get tough, they get tough
Trade all your heroes in for ghosts
In for ghosts, in for ghosts
They're always the ones that love you most
Love you most, love you most
Your love alone
Is not enough, not enough, not enough
It's what you felt
It's what you said, what you said, what you said
You said the sky would fall on you
Fall on you, fall on you
Through all the pain your eyes stayed Blue
They stayed Blue, Baby Blue
But your love alone won't save the world
You knew the secret of the universe
Despite it all you made it worse
It left you lonely
It left you cursed
You stole the sun
Straight from my heart, from my heart, from heart
With no excuses
Just fell apart, fell apart, fell apart
No you won't make a mess of me
Mess of me, mess of me
For you're as blind as a man can be
Man can be, man can be
I could have seen for miles and miles
I could have made you feel alright
I could have placed us in exile
(I could have written all your lines)
I could have shown you
(Could have shown you)
How to cry
Your love alone
Is not enough
Your love alone
Is not enough
La la la la la la la la
I could have shown you
Shown you how to cry
Your love alone
Is not enough
Your love alone
