I had this dream about you
We sat under the [?] willow trees
You took your clothes of
Then you looked at me and said "When I lie alone I hope I don't wake up again"
I hope you hate me, after everything
I still hope you hate me
(I hope you hate me)
I hope you hate me, after everything
I hope you hate me!
When I lie alone I hope I don't wake up
When I lie alone I hope I don't wake up
I hope I don't wake up again
I hope I don't wake up again
When I lie alone I hope I don't wake up
When I lie alone I hope I don't wake up
When I lie alone I hope I don't wake up
When I lie alone I hope I don't wake up
