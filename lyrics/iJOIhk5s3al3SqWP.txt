Here I sit by my window
Thinking about all the things that I've been through
There were times when I never thought
I would get to where I got to

Had some angels to guide me
Some who just violated my love
Now this is my chance to say
Ain't got nothin' but love

For my family that raised me
(Shout out, shout out)
And my teacher that done praised me
(Shout out, shout out)

To anyone who tried to hate on me
(Shout out, shout out)
Even the ones who tried to break me
Even the ones who tried to take me down

There's been haters since this world been going 'round
(Nothin' but love)
Why they take a thing to try to crush them down?
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)

I ain't even trying to hold on to that now
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for you
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)

I could hold on to pain but that ain't what my life's about
I ain't blaming nobody if I ain't got my stuff worked out
I got a lot for myself, ain't gonna regret anything I've done
I just wanna sing my song, ain't got nothin' but love

For all the players on the street
(Shout out, shout out)
To all my ghetto doing your own thing
(Deep on, keep strong)
To all my exes that done wrong me, stepped on me, can't hold me down

There's been haters since this world been going 'round
(Nothin' but love)
Why they take a thing to try to crush them down?
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)

I ain't even trying to hold on to that now
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for you

To all the givers and the takers
To my crew from way back when
To the cold words and the stares
And the ones that I ain't met

For myself for sticking with me
For the ones I missin' up above
Anyone who's ever been a part of me
Ain't got nothin' but love
(Nothin' but nothin')
I got nothin' but love

There's been haters since this world been going 'round
(Nothin' but love)
Why they take a thing to try to crush them down?
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)

I ain't even trying to hold on to that now
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for you
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for you
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for you
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for you
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for you
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for you
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
