I see shadow and light
Stroking the mist
And I hear voices take flight
And send out our wish
Of peaceful dreams on a night
Moonlight kissed

Tendrils of smoke lash the street
And shamelessly court
Disguised honey sweet
To cater all sorts
And hushed tones all agree
And the world distorts
Wishing on a speck of dust
In this crazy ocean of fate
An echo of a memory
And maybe just a little too late

Fingers of blue on the snow
Reaching to touch
The warm light still aglow
Across the porch
We watch the scene die untold
Outside our window

For my words are the salt of lust
On that ivory skin
Difficult to hear at all
Through the everyday din
What is this if not some witchcraft?
Wrapped up widdershins
To lead us all astray
in mouth
On through some webs of lies
Truth's a distant star
In our eyes
Moonlight kissed

New day comes again
And it laughs in your face
Whispering secrets of pain
By all its names
What flame could burn out the stain
Of a life misplaced?

But summer's scent still lingers
In your hair
Despite the ache
There's magic everywhere
Out the window run rebellion
Rapt with all you find
For seeking something new
Play in the ponds like summer's wind
Dance with the trees melding with mist
Beyond their flower field like
You're moonlight kissed
