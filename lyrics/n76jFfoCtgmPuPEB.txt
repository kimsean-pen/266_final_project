Served a lifetime's fearfulness to be denied
How I mind who ever lived this life
Wondering what of me made him decide
To turn me from the city in the sky
What must I have done in my past life
To deserve this neglection before my eyes?
Waiting for a chance to make him see
To live in exile is destroying me
The pain I forced upon myself is deep
Now I can rest in peace...
Now fly away until I reach a piece of forgivness
If it even exists
Maybe someday I will learn to forgive and forget
But right now, I can't
Forever praising him devotedly
Yet here I am being denied my dream
Now the agers buiding up inside
My blood is boiling to be justified
Waiting for a chance to make him see
To live in exile is destroying me
The pain I forced upon myself is deep
Now I can rest in peace...
Now fly away until I reach a piece of forgivness
If it even exists
Then maybe someday I will learn to forgive and forget
But right now, I can't
Now fly away until I reach a piece of forgiveness
If it even exists
Then maybe someday I will learn to forgive and forget
but right now I can't
Heaven's waiting for you and you take your final breath
let your soul be at rest
His arms wide open but you'll never feel his warm embrace
Angel in disgrace!
