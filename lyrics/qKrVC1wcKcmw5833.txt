I know what you need
I know.
You wonder how i feel without you here
Maybe you wonder
just baby dont lose it .

lets find the way
(I've never felt this way)
Make it worth it
(Just let me feel okay)
To get through this
(Just listen to what i say)
allow the fellow word

(Don't lose your mind)
it's just a matter of perfection
love is life if your mind is of pure intention
(just work your heart)
and your soul glows as bright as the night sky
(Night sky)

its just a matter of finding your wings to fly

Let's find the way
(I've never felt this way)
Make it worth it
(Just let me feel okay)
To get through this
(Just listen to what i say)
The edge of the world

(Don't lose your mind)
it's just a matter of perfection
love is life if your mind is of pure intention
(just work your heart)
and the soul glows as bright as the night sky
(Night sky)
its just a matter of finding your wings to fly...
to the edge of the the world
(to the edge of the world)
