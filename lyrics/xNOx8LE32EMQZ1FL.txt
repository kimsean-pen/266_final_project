You have flipped my view
Yeah I'm not used to these changes
All these brand new feelings I can't explain
But somehow I like it

And if I find out
That you feel the same way
As I do I will love you

As soon as I can stand up straight ohh

You got me walking sideways
Spinning all around
Dizzy because you flip my world

Upside down
Upside down

I've been so confused

I wouldn't normally fall for someone quite like you
I'm tripping over my own thoughts
But baby I really like you a lot

(I wonder if you feel the same)
If you feel the same way
(I wouldn't know just what to do)
Cause I can't even stand up straight

You got me walking sideways
Spinning all around
Dizzy because you flip my world
Upside down

Upside down
Can somebody tell me why I feel this way
24/7 you're always on my brain
I can't really put my finger on it but
(You got me so twisted)
I've had crushes before
but it's not the same
Something different about you I can't explain
Baby you're making me insane
(You got me so twisted)

Oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahh
Baby you got me teisted
You flip my whole world

You got me walking sideways
Spinning all around (spinning all around)
Dizzy because you flip my world
Upside down
Upside down

You got me walking sideways
Spinning all around
