There's no one outside
It's just the wind blowing trees
Nothing there
Just the sound of guilty leaves

You can feel the cold inside
The rising moon
Looking down like a broken sun
Shining bright

So we can see what we've become
There is nowhere to hide inside

Why won't you say something now
Don't leave me hanging
Cut me down
I miss the fire that was once in your eyes
Well come on and say something now

I close my eyes
I see the ghosts you keep within
Once I made them disappear
You know I did
And did I leave you all alone?

Come on and talk to me now
Or forever hold your peace
It's all got so heavy
Gonna bring us to our knees
Come on and say something now

Say something
Say something
Say something now

Say something
Say something
Say something now

Ooh, come on talk to me
Or forever hold your peace, babe
It's all got so heavy
Gonna bring us to our knees
Come on and say something now

Say something
Say something
Say something to me

Say something
Say something to me or forever hold your peace

It's all got so heavy
Gonna bring us to our knees
Come on and say something now

Say something
Say something
Say something to me

Say something
Say something to me or forever hold your peace

I miss the fire that was once in your eyes
Come on and say something now
