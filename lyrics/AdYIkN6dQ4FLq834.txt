Break down, tears fall to the ground
Tell myself, do it, nothing can be found
When you're a fighter
You're a fighter
You're a fighter, fight on baby

Some days I'm sure I lose to fate
Some days I cannot find my faith
But I just fight on
I just fight on
I just fight on baby, baby

And I am a wounded warrior
And now that the enemy is closing in
I am a wounded warrior
Looking for someone to let me in

Black and blue, I'm begging you
Take me in, I'm surrendering
Black and blue, but if I'm with you
If I'm with you, I'll live to fight on through

I'll let go, walk into the unknown
If I surrender, if I lay my arms down
Am I a fighter?
Am I a fighter?
'Cause I've been fighting so long baby

And I am a wounded warrior
And now that the enemy is closing in
I am a wounded warrior
Looking for someone to let me in

Black and blue, I'm begging you
Take me in, I'm surrendering
Black and blue, but if I'm with you
If I'm with you, I'll live to fight on through

I am a wounded warrior
And now that the enemy is closing in
I am a wounded warrior
Looking for someone to let me in

I am wounded warrior
Now that the enemy is closing in
Closing in
Looking for someone to let me in, oh! Oh oh oh oh

Looking for someone to let me in

Black and blue, I'm begging you
Take me in, I'm surrendering
Black and blue, but if I'm with you
If I'm with you, I'll live to fight on through

Black and blue, I'm begging you
Take me in, I'm surrendering
Black and blue, but if I'm with you
If I'm with you, I'll live to fight on through
