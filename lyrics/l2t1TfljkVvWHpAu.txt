They come as we lie
Can't find the time
For you you and your kind
Let's be allright
They find a new care
And I guess they're going
Holy holy mother
I just can't be fighting
Be??
Holy lover
I'm just so excited
Forget about the others
We'll be kind

Shooting stars
Don't get caught
I'm the jealous kind
Holy mother
I just can't be fighting
Holy mother
I'm just so excited
Don't be kind

Oh my holy mother
I won't quit this time
You should??
Oh holy mother
I hope it's good enough
I don't know

Holy holy mother
I just can't be fighting
Be willing??
And be kind
Holy lover
I'm just so excited
Don't care about the other
Don't be kind

I'll be kind
Don't be too kind
I'll be kind
Don't be too kind
I'll be kind
Don't be too kind
I'll be kind
Don't be too kind
