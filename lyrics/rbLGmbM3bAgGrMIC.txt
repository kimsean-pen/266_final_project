You're on in five,
it's time you rise or fail.
They've gone before,
stood by your door all day.
For what it's worth,
defend your kind from shame.
The lights are down,
go on inside, they've paid.
You're the face in stone,
through the land I own.
You never found it home.
You're not the girl I used to know.

What would you hide from such a glow
If I had only told you so?

You're on in five, it's time you rise or fail.
They've gone before, stood by your door all day.
But you never found it home.
A fair price I'd pay to be alone.

What would you hide from such a glow
If I had only told you so?
