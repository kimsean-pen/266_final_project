Loneliness is a cloak you wear
A deep shade of blue is always there
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always cloudin' your eyes
When you're without love, baby

Emptiness is a place you're in
But nothin' to lose, but no more to win
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always cloudin' your eyes
When you're without love

Lonely without you, baby
Girl, I need you, I can't go on
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore (The sun ain't gonna shine anymore)
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky (The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky)
Tears are always cloudin' your eyes (Tears are always cloudin' my eyes)
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
When you're without love, baby

(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore)
(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore) No, no
(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore)
Baby (The sun ain't gonna shine anymore) baby

(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore)
(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore) Woo, woo, woo-oo
(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore) No, no, baby
(The sun ain't gonna shine anymore) Baby
