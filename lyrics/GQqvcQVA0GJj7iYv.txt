Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on

I don't know why is late to give up
I know that i've been going too far
It seem so easy when you show up
I wish that i can folk it bout it
I know that ive been probably wrong
to look at you like may you can start
To mention all this is mess in this song
You know what i'm thinking about it
How is everything?
She made a promise
She won't come back

Don't try so hard to get me under you spell
It's only music baby no kiss and touch

Im feeling whispers on me
what can you see?
Please just turn off the T.V.
and dance whit me
