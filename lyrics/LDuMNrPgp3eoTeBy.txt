Oh, I know why you chasing all the headlights
Oh, 'cause you always tryina get ahead of light
Baby when you go
You know I'll be waiting on the other side
And I know it's cold
But if you stay then I could keep you warm at night

Don't be a fool for the city nights
I know it's cool but it's only light
Baby with you I can never lie
Don't go chasing all the headlights

Oh, I could feel the beating of your heartache drum
Oh, don't know if I'm dreaming or if you have gone
Every time you go
Hits me like a bullet from a golden gun
Yeah I know it's cold
But if you stay then I could give you all my love

Don't be a fool for the city nights
I know it's cool but it's only light
Baby with you I can never lie
So, don't go chasing all the headlights

Don't be a fool for the city nights
I know it's cool but it's only light
Baby with you I can never lie
So, don't go chasing all the headlights
