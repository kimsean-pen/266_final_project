I stumble through the wreckage
Rusted from the rain.
There's nothing left to salvage
No one left to blame.
Among the broken mirrors
I don't look the same.
I'm rusted from the rain.
I'm rusted from the rain.

Dissect me 'til me blood runs
Down into the drain.
My bitter heart is pumping
Oil into my veins.
I'm nothing but a tin man
Don't feel any pain.
I don't feel any pain.
I don't feel any pain.

I'm rusted from the rain.

Go on, crush me like a flower
Rusted from the rain.
C'mon strip me of my power
Beat me with the chains.
And if I'm the King of cowards
You're the Queen of pain.

I'm rusted from the rain.
I'm rusted from the rain.

You hung me like a picture
Now I'm just a frame.
I used to be a lap dog
Now I'm just a stray.
Shackled in the graveyard
Left here to decay.

Left here to decay.
Left here to decay.
I'm rusted from the rain.

Go on, crush me like a flower
Rusted from the rain.
C'mon, strip me of my power
Beat me with the chains.
And if I'm the King of cowards

You're the Queen of pain.
I'm rusted from the rain.
I'm rusted from the rain.
I'm rusted from the rain

Go on, crush me like a flower
Rusted from the rain.
C'mon strip me of my power

Beat me with the chains.
And if I'm the King of cowards
You're the Queen of pain.
I'm rusted from the rain.
I'm rusted from the rain.

Go on, crush me like a flower
Rusted from the rain.

C'mon strip me of my power
Beat me with the chains.
And if I'm the King of cowards
You're the Queen of pain.
I'm rusted from the rain.
I'm rusted from the rain.
Oh, the sun will shine again.
I'm rusted from the rain.
I'm rusted from the rain.
Oh, the sun will shine again.
I'm rusted from the rain.
