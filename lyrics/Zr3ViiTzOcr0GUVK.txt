What if another universe
Complete with sun and moon
An entire galaxy and what's worse
U and eye 2 soon
Find each other xpanding beyond this dirty room
Butterscotch mountains
Sunshine

Run ur fingers up and down the
Obelisk in the earth
Down 2 33 rmps where
The primordial gives birth
Or else we lie neck high u and eye
In one another's ooze
Volcano magic
Summer time

Everybody knows what happens
When u worship from afar
The ebb and flow of angels
Dancing around the star
And if the sunrise is still a question
The answer's in the dark
Celibate
Mushroom
