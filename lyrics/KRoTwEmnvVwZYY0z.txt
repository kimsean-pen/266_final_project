Garden, Still and Cold
Leaves Once Green Turned To Gold
Wrapped In Fields, Eternal Sky
I Bid Farewell, I Die...
Birds of The Night, Sing My Songs
Ocean of Tears, Leads So Long
Solitude of My Spirit, I Am Free
Now I Am Dead Forever
Storms of Sadness Cleanse My Wings
I Dwell In Grief After I Die
The Landscapes So Below
I Harken up, The Sunset Choir
Sings From The Palace of Frost
The Place Where I Shall Dwell Now
The Palace For The Lost
