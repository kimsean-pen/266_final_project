you fall in love, you let him go
you know his past, now let it go
and all his time was spent alone
a pent up fear has yet to blow
indifferent to the time at hand
time stood still for another chance
fell victim to the morning light
the fog rose high
and i close my eyes
i close my eyes
the fog rose high
and i close my eyes
you held me high, don't let me go
we spent some time, you're all i know
and all my fear begins to flow
we closed our eyes, and begin to float
indifferent to the time at hand
time stood still for another chance
fell victim to the morning light
the fog rose high
and i close my eyes
i close my eyes
the fog rose high
and i close my eyes
