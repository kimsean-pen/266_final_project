There's a tear in the fabric of your favorite dress and I'm sneaking glances
Looking for the patterns in static: they start to make sense the longer I'm at it

Ivory lines lead...

Your heart is a river that flows from your chest through every organ
Your brain is the dam and I am the fish who can't reach the core

Ivory lines lead...

Oh, instincts are misleading; You shouldn't think what you're feeling
They don't tell you what you know you should want

Ivory lines lead...

Oh instincts are misleading; You shouldn't think what you're feeling
They don't tell you what you know you should want

Ivory lines lead...
