Somehow calm as she walks on stage
Her entire empire becomes your taste, your taste, show me, come
Let me know what you're like, let me know what you're like
What's your taste?

I bet she carves your heart when she walks onstage
Her empire slowly becomes your place, your place, show me, come on
Let me know what you're like, let me know what you're like
In your place, your place

Somehow calm as she walks offstage

An entire empire recall your face, your face, show me, come
Let me know what you're like, let me know what you're like
Your face, your face
Hopelessly devoted
