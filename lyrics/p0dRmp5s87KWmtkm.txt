Will I be a a mother or will I always be a child?
Does someone come and say, "hey girl, it's your time"?
What if I'm dancing and I don't hear the door knock?
And some cold caller decides I'm not
Ready to change
Oh what if my body is but my mind remains the same?
Will I be a mother or will I always be a child?
Does someone come and say your time has arrived?
What if I'm sleeping and I don't wake with the clock?
And I sleep right through it and some kind of god decides im not
Ready to change
On what if my mind is but my body won't take to the stage
I heard her screaming last night in my dreams
I tried to reach out and hold her
Can someone please tell me what that screaming means?
And not say wait till you get older
Are you alright?
I have to see
Oh my sweet sister
You've always been braver than me
Oh what if my love is but I'm not ready to be?
I'm willing to change
Oh it's not just me he's also afraid.
