Collected thoughts
Never forget
The final hour
Now is set
Paranoia
In your cold soul
Man's requiem
In silence told

Sacrificed - The fallen lie
All areas - Now pacified
As they are - We shall become
The glory of... another battle won

The long dark path - Journey on
May lose the war - This day is done
Await tomorrow - Foretold destiny
Withdraw the veil - Friend or enemy

Constructed
Too much haste
All is now
Laid to waste

Unchained
Sanity's unsafe
All is now
Laid to waste

Constructed
Too much haste
All is now
Laid to waste

Senses recaptured - Tortured knowledge
Laid to waste
