The ice is really cold
The street light's really old
A child's all alone
As she melts into her own
And slowly fades away
Into a river full of shame
But at least numb to the pain

Can you see it?
Can you feel the shadow wave
From a needle to the grave
From her hell to far away
You're my only
You're so sad, my valentine
On your journey to the light
But first straight to the fire

And we are
All that we are
Holding on
Until we fall apart

And we are
All that we are
Holding on
Until we fall apart

And we are
All that we are
Holding on
Until we fall apart

And we are
All that we are
Holding on
Until we fall apart

We are
All that we are
All that we are
All that we are
All that we are
All that we are
All that we are
All that we are
All that we are

(All that we, all that we, all that...)
