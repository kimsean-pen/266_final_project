Where have you wandered, my only child
Why are you not coming back?
Your mother is crying her eyes out
And I in my dreams hear your voice

"Father, will you take me away
Father will you take and save me from my fate
Father, will you take me away
Father will you take and save me from my fate"

Wanted to go, look for you a hundred times
But I couldn't leave her alone
The end of the world ruined our home
Yet didn't destroy our hope

Acid rain is pouring down
On the caravans of shadows
Once they used to be humans
Dying of too much choice

Devoid of trust and empathy
They were passing each other
Now, together with raised hands
In tears they call out at the sky

"Father, will you take me away
Father will you take and save me from my fate
Father, will you take me away
Father will you take and save me from... my fate"

"Father will you take and save me from... my fate"
