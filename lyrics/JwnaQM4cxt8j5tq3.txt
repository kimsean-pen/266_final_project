Catch me running around the town if you can
My heart on my sleeve and the world in my hands
Where do we go where do we stand?
You dream but you never move, so don't be mad when I do

Patiently waiting to give up everything I got
Start thinking about my future at the number one spot
My friends think they lost me
But I'm still the same me

Hooligans
Got big hearts but they're just some kids
Cali made, flashy sins
Need nobody 'cause we know where we fit in

I'm so close to the edge of the life that I sacrificed and strived for
But you've buried everything we used to fight for
That we used to fight for
Set it off

Patiently waiting to give up everything I got
Start thinking about my future at the number one spot
My friends think they lost me
But I would never change

And I would sell out my pride when everybody wanna say
You never gave a damn bout your boys in the first place
Old Dena raised me
And the road will never change me

Hooligans
Got big hearts but they're just some kids
Cali made, flashy sins
Need nobody 'cause we know where we fit in

To everyone who stuck around, this one's for you
They may say we're a lost 'cause but they don't see what I do

Hooligans
Got big hearts but they're just some kids
Cali made, flashy sins
Need nobody 'cause we know where we fit in
