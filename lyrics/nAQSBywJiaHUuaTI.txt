I'm lost for you
With every moment stay true
I'd go as far as to say that I missed you
So far away
I missed my one chance to say
So long to memories of years that passed away

On these walls tell the stories passed of years gone by
Breaking promises
Pictures up in black and white
Holding back all the words I said
I said goodbye
Open wounds, broken hearts
Please stay tonight

So send your letters of regret (So send your letters of regret)
It's not the words you never said (It's not the words you never said)
Sing to me
Speak softly now
Hearts will beat
that empty sound
