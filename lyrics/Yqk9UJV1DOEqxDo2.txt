I can see you crawling
And I'm chasing on all fours
Wouldn't know what to do
To be perfectly honest

All the chemicals reel
In the absence of the noise
We are fools in the wake
Of the physical

I just don't know
What I want
You just don't know
What you want
Yeah, we don't know
What we want
Just keep it trivial

I'm in love with the pace
And all that you never are
Throwing stones as we stay
Somewhere visible
Just keep it trivial
Just keep it trivial

I just don't know
What I want
You just don't know
What you want
Yeah, we don't know
What we want
Just keep it trivial

And if you wake to find a weightlessness in me
Pulse and fire, break to breathe
Darling wait, hold and see
And if you leave it does that mean you would be free?
Just say anything to me

I just don't know
What I want
You just don't know
What you want
Yeah, we don't know
What we want
Just keep it trivial
