PT boat on the way to Havana
I used to make a livin'
Man pickin' the banana
Now I'm a guide for the CIA hooray
For the U.S.A
Baby, baby, make me a loco
Baby, baby, make me a mambo

Sent to spy on a Cuban talent show
First stop Havana go go
I used to make a living
Man pickin' the banana hooray
For Havana
Baby, baby, make me a loco
Baby, baby, make me a mambo
