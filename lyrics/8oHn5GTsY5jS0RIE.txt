Step in from the brink
But only to look back
That was too easy
There is no challenge worthy
Burning the bridge I stand on

Tear up my map home
Draw a new one on my skin
The remedy is easy
When you have the right recipe

Self destruction, in its most simple form
Ruin my body from inside out
Make the pain in my mind
And in my soul

Visible on my skin
A burning, stabbing in my guts
And a sadness in you as you watch
My beautiful performance made
Especially for none and all
