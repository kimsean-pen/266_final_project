Turn the night up, make your dirty thoughts unhidden
Kneel down low, till it feels like your religion
Even in your darkest hour your body feels alive
Tell me am I coming through loud and clear
Let me be the one to get you out of here
Cause I'm holding on, till this feeling is gone

Go get it up on everybody, even if you don't, pretend you got it
Give it everything, you've hit the bottom, go and get it up all on somebody
Oh, oh, oh, oh, go and get it up on everybody
Oh, oh, oh, oh, go and get it up all on somebody

Dance like the highest walls couldn't contain you
Close your eyes, follow where the rhythm takes you
Cause I'm holding on, till this feeling is gone
