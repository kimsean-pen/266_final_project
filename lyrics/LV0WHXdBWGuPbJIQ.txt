I dont wanna wait in vain for your love (2x)

From the very first time I blessed my eyes on you, girl
My heart says follow through
But I know now that Im way down on your line
And the waiting feel is fine
So dont treat me like a puppet on a string
Cause I know how to do my thing
Dont talk to me as if you think Im dumb

I wanna know when youre gonna come?
I dont wanna wait in vain for your love (3x)

Cause summer is here
Im still waiting there
Winter is here
And Im still waiting there

Like I said
Its been three years since Im knocking on your door
And I still can knock some more
Ooh girl, ooh girl, is it feaseble?
I wanna know now
For I to knock some more

In life I know
Theres lots of grief
But your love is my relief
Tears in my eyes burn
Tears in my eyes burn
While Im waiting
While Im waiting for my turn

I dont wanna wait in vain for your love...
