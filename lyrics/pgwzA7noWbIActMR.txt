Blinded I am
And so are you
By shedding tears
Confusion that separates us two...
We hold dear

Just look into my eyes
Kiss our fears goodbye

I'm reaching for your shadow
Drowning in
The kiss of dawn
Touching the pain that you left me with
At the kiss of dawn

I'm tired of the games
I'm playing with you
When you're not here
Death frees from the fear of dying
It's true, have no fear

Let me look into your eyes
And see death pass us by

I'm reaching for your shadow
Drowning in
The kiss of dawn
Touching the pain that you left me with
At the kiss of dawn...

I'm reaching for your shadow
Drowning in
The kiss of dawn
Touching the pain that you left me with
At the kiss of dawn

I'm reaching for your shadow
Drowning in
The kiss of dawn...

Reaching for your shadow drowning in
The kiss of dawn
Touching the pain that you left me with
The kiss of dawn
I'm reaching for your shadow drowning in
The kiss of dawn
Touching...
