The blank pages of my diary,
That I haven't touched since you left me,
The closed blinds in my home
See no light of day
Dust gathers on my stereo
Cos I can't bare to hear the radio
The piano sits in a shaded space
With a picture of your face

I'm scared to face another day
Cos the fear in me just won't go away
In an instant, you were gone and I'm scared

Coffee stains on your favorite book
Remind me of you so I can't take a look
The magazines you left on the floor,
You won't need them anymore

A towel left hangin on the wall,
No sign of wet foosteps in the hall
There's no smell of your sweet cologne
I'm lying here alone

I'm scared to face another day
Cos the fear in me just won't go away
In an instant, you were gone and now I'm scared

I'm scared to face another day
Cos the fear in me just won't go away
In an instant, you were gone, now I'm scared
In an instant you were gone and I'm scared
